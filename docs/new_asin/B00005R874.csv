1653477,2,B00005R874,"Ok......To be fair...if you're LOOKING for rabid toilet humor and copious cursing...this should have 4 stars. I almost wrote such a review, because I think that if you know what to expect and you *want* ... that ... this film is actually *good*. But it's packed innocuously into ""sci fi comedy,"" and I'm very afraid parents expecting scifi comedy on the order of the original Ghostbusters are going to que this up in error and get burned.

If you're looking for a movie to use for a ""kids are at Grandma's"" night -- one where you and your buddies relive that time ""the brass"" badly botched a really important military engagement, or that time you ruined a brilliant career and ended up in a dead end job, or that time you were being shot down by hot young things 20 years too young for even a pity ""night' ... with a comic backdrop and a thin veneer of sci fi of course...then this...is the movie for you. If you like ""do a jello shot every time someone curses and/or says alien"" type games, this is also a good film. But it's still not *really* good comic sci-fi.

It's hard to articulate what I just watched.

I can only imagine that the majority of the big names attached to this film were really very bored, or that some sort of bet had to be settled. It doesn't feel like it was made by the desperate, so I'd love to know the story.....

It's like Army of Darkness, something like 28 Days Later or The Arrival, and some movie predicated with the words ""National Lampoon's"" got drunk and had some sort of especially nasty tryst on the back lot of a Hollywood studio...and it birthed this film. I'm almost at a loss for words to describe it.

I can't say the movie was bad. Two stars means, and I quote, ""I didn't like it."" And well...that's where I end up.

I mean...it WAS bad...gawd it was awful. But it was bad in that sort of way that some people really enjoy....almost MST3K bad.

The sad thing is that the actors did *spectacularly* with the script they were given. Every single speaking character was some sort of trope, and every last one of them was *believable* in the role assigned to that trope, which was *great* (best part about the movie, really). The lines are smooth, the movie is well delivered...the puppets and CGI look like that's where the entire 80 million dollar budget went...it's *so* strange how it falls just shy of being ""good camp.""

It was too entertaining (and far too high budget) to say it was ""weird crap"" like Plan 9 from Outer Space (which, again, some people love). Honestly, if we took out the *rabid* toilet humor, and cleaned up the constant-every-three-lines-or-so cursing, and especially the GD's a bit, the hour of film that would be left would make for a pretty good ""weird cult flick."" I mean...you could even leave in the shot of Duchovny's backside, which was as close as the film got to any overt nudity.

And that's why I just have to give it 2 stars instead of 3....it's so *disappointing*.

This movie is an absolute poster-child for the VidAngel service.

If you take that PG-13 to mean ""a jaded 13 year old who is already street-wise enough to appreciate all the sexual innuendo (and direct statements) and who won't blink at the ample cursing, and who won't care about ""the fly scene"" (you'll know which one...no spoilers)....and that nasty...nasty boos-mob fight"" then yes...this is PG-13...otherwise...not so much.

This movie falls solidly into that genre of ""most of the humor is really too crude for PG-13 and the language has to be *right* on the raggity edge...but no one thing is enough to land it an R rating."" And I'd let it go, but this could have been a *fun* film, like a PG-13 version of Galaxy Quest (and I think it would have been a box office smash had they gone that route)...and it just...wasn't.

It was worth the ""Free with your Prime membership"" that I paid to watch it, and honestly, had I plunked down up to a fiver to see it, I wouldn't feel *cheated*. But if I'd sat down with my *family* expecting PG-13 comedy, I'd have been pretty *peeved* -- and so I'm writing this review in the hopes that folks looking for ""family PG-13 night"" see it and are forewarned.",1519689600,4,4145,4.503328894806924

The acting is horrible,  the  attempt at comedy is middle school humor at it's worst. A complete waste of time.  Not only is the movie a poor attempt at entertaining,  but even as late as 2001 when this movie was made  there is an undertone of sexist  sexual ""humor"". that is rampant through the story line ...  No wonder, 15-16 yrs later we have so many women coming forward complaining of past sexual impropriety.

1653490,2,B00005R874,"It had some silly parts, but most of it was pretty boring. Just high school humor: an alien going up someone's butt, some juvenile sex jokes, etc. I don't think it was meant to be at all believable, but they could have at least made the effort to have more coherent development of the plot, and the stereotype-based jokes could have been more subtle: the jokes are all so self-conscious that they make the characters less funny, and as soon as the characters point out their place in the story (like, ""Oh hey, I'm the 'black guy'!"" ""Oh hey, I'm the 'seemingly-angry love-interest-chick'!""), it makes the other punchlines more predictable.",1518739200,3,638,4.8090909090909095

This is not a terrible movie. It's also not going to go on my 'must watch' list. If you start watching it with idea that you have some time to kill and this looks like it might be funny, then your on the right track.

This has all of the archetypes you might expect in this type of movie:  The bumbling lady scientist - smart and pretty and yet she can't seem to get it all together so she's always tripping over things and dropping papers. The stupid college kids who really are clueless yet they help save the day. It has the handsome scientist and the army man who believes the best solution is to blow it up (whatever it is).

It has the typical situation you might expect in this type of movie and the jokes that you would expect.

All in all, it was just really dumb, pointless, foolish, etc.

I was never sure if the director was trying to be completely ridiculous (like that was the whole point), or was just counting on the audience to be stupid.

Hence, this movie has a VERY similar feel to it.  If you enjoyed the original Ghostbusters movie - this is even better!!  There are so many '1-liners' in this movie, my husband and I can quote them for hours.  Here's some of my faves!!
.
-  ""Fruit basket for Gen, Russel Woodman"" (as David Duchovny aka eternally as 'Fox Mulder' moons the general)
-  Governor to General, ""You'd better make sure this works Sergeant""...  ""That's General, sir""...  ""Not if you screw this up""
-  .""ka-ka and tookie-tookie do not work""
-  ""Dr. Reed is a humorless ice queen, in need of a good humping.......  Oh Ira, oh Ira...."" (not knowing she's listening)
-  Harry gets a bug stuck inside him, ""We're going to have to go in anally - there's no time for lubricant"".... once done, they ask if Harry needs anything...  ""Ice Cream, I'd like some Ice Cream"".... ""What flavor?"".... ""It doesn't matter, it's for my @$$"".

Two college scientists attempt to learn about the organisms but the military takes over and bungles the job.

This line comes out of nowhere like some wuss producer forced Reitman to put it in to make sure this movie appealed to blacks through a stereotype. Apparently in between teaching Geology and coaching the women's volleyball team Professor Harry Block preaches on Sunday.

Goofy, silly, potentially provocative, but then glosses right over the thinking stuff which is a shame. Totally fine for non-science folks who just want to see monsters romp.

1653602,4,B00005R874,"Evolution can been seen as a spiritual successor to Ghostbusters. Not only did Ivan Reitman produce and direct both, but a lot of the same beats can be seen in both films: our heroes work at a college, they're scientists, and when the Government comes and pokes it's nose into their business, all hell breaks loose and our heroes end up fighting a giant monster to save the day.

Now while Ghostbusters is a hugely superior film compared to Evolution, that does not mean this movie it without it's good points. Orlando Jones is hilarious as Harry Block, and David Duchovny's self-assured and laid back Ira Kane does have charisma and good chemistry with Julianne Moore's Dr. Allison Reed. The special effects are also very good and have aged well. In a day of when everything is CGI, it's refreshing to see some practical creatures effects.

The plot is very basic and moves as briskly as the one liners. A meteor has crashed into Earth and released alien life that is quickly multiplying and evolving. It is up to two college professors, a wanna-be fireman, and a Government scientist to figure out a plan before the life-forms grow out of control and the military levels the area with napalm.

Evolution is a good movie. It's nothing great, but it does have some very funny moments, good special effects, and a distinct Ghostbuster-like charm.",1493424000,2,1345,4.763948497854077

1653664,5,B00005R874,"This movie was probably made to cash in on Duchovny's fame following the ""X-Files"" series as well as the movies, as some of the sarcastic oblique references in the dialogue attest. Having a leading lady who's red-haired and bears a slight resemblance to Gillian Anderson didn't hurt, either.

This is a fast-paced little tale running along the lines of ""the Blob"" in places...alien landing, insidious creatures consuming citizens...but the aliens begin as one-celled organisms only to become more highly-evolved  as time goes by.

Two teachers from an Arizona community college discover a meteor and its occupants and decides to go for a Nobel Prize. Of course, the government comes in to spoil their fun, takes over and that's where the trouble starts. With the aid of the lady scientist, a would-be fireman, and two students just wanting to get a good grade, our heroes save the day in an ending rivaling the finale of ""Ghostbusters.""

Needless to say, in spite of the evolution of the creatures, the final monster does resemble Lovecraft's Cthulu quite a bit. Orlando Jones, with those huge goggling eyes behind his little glasses, is the best part of the story, bring a slight seriousness to the film while holding his own in the comedic sections.

Some critics dissed this movie but it's all fun so enjoy it and don't sweat the small stuff.

1653695,4,B00005R874,"I loved this movie as a child. As an adult however, it's flaws are glaring and it's kind of a hard watch. I would still recommend it though, especially if you have kids. As I said, I loved this as a kid, this was such a great movie and it's one of those rare ones that I just never forgot. The movie is about a meteor that slammed into the Earth. It contained alien life that quickly started evolving, hence the name ""Evolution"". These creatures keep evolving right up until the very end of the movie and you get to see many different types of life forms and ways life might evolve on another planet.

This is not a super realistic movie, it's full of jokes and silliness that will entertain your children. I prefer a more serious take on most movies, books, etc. I still enjoyed the movie, it's just not what is was like as a kid. If you give it an honest chance, I don't think you'll be disappointed. It might get your child asking questions about the world and how we came into existence ourselves.",1456444800,2,1001,4.296296296296297

1653980,4,B00005R874,"So, while we're waiting for Ghostbusters 3, Ivan Reitman and company where smart to give us a movie that will keep spirits high.

Now when I say Ghostbusters with Aliens, I really mean that;
The set-up and exposition is similar, and the parallels are awesome!

If you are a Ghostbusters fanatic, you are going to have a lot of fun seeing the similarities,
because some of them are just down right hilarious

Is Evolution a perfect movie? No, personally I wish it had been a little more focused, but in the end
the movie had great pacing, great characters, some cool aliens, fun homages,
and all of those simply mean that the bottom line is a
64%- Not as evolved as it's superior and far more supernatural counterpart but still funny and clever,
Evolution is another good film from Ivan Reitman.",1396915200,,794,4.617021276595745

1653988,5,B00005R874,"This was altogether weird and funny with some very good special effects. One night, a young man practicing to be a future fireman finds his practice interrupted by a meteor crashing almost on top of him. David and the coach from the high school where he teaches are called in to examine the space rock and they discover something most unusual indeed. The rock is teeming with alien life that begins to evolve at a terrifying rate, and worse, it is spreading from the cave where it landed, popping up in various places throughout the town. Things only get worse when the military moves in to commandeer the project and an ousted David has to join forces with a woman scientist in order to find a way to stop the invasion. While this has the feel of ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" and is something of a parody all the way, the sight of the evolving creatures is indeed worth watching and the end is truly a gigantic butt joke when one sees just how they actually have to stop the creatures, leading to a shampoo commercial in the end of all things.

Duchovny plays the sarcastic junior-college biology prof. who tells his whole class that they all got ""A""'s on their first tests and he expects that trend to continue as he intends to grade them generously throughout the entire term (saving him the odious task of actually reading and grading their work!) Put simple - he ""plays"" himself!  His fellow college prof buddy (Orlando Jones) is a made-to-order straight man for Duchovny's deadpan delivery.  If your looking for some laughs, this is your baby!

Whether or not you'll like this type of humor depends entirely on your appreciation of enema jokes.  To suggest this movie is merely goofy doesn't fully appreciate the lengths they'll go to for a laugh.  Yes, there's a sphincter joke to end all sphincter jokes.  Julianne Moore does pratfalls, Ted Levine snarls, Orlando Jones has the best lines and knows exactly what to do with them, while the rest of the cast just falls in line and tries to keep up.  The `science' is dubious at best, but the special effects are great and hold up surprisingly well after a decade of changing technology.  Naturally, they have to throw in the requisite problem of the backstabbing military willing to go to any lengths to keep this discovery to themselves (vainglory and all that).  There's even a courtroom scene that doesn't make any sense (apparently, Dr. Allison Reed also moonlights as a lawyer).  At least Dan Aykroyd shows up to lend an air of respectability to the proceedings, once the military decides to do what they always do in these types of movies: blow everything up.

We laughed our butts off at this flick from beginning to end. It's directed by Ivan Reitman who also directed another favorite of mine: Ghost Busters.

The plot: An alien invasion has struck a small town in Arizona, and four experts must stop the race from expanding to the rest of the country. College professors, Ira Kane (David Duchovny of ""The X-Files"" fame) and Harry Block (Orlando Jones, ""MadTV""), 17-yr old wannabe firefighter, Wayne Grey (Seann William Scott, ""American Pie"", ""Road Trip"") and the clumsy-but sexy Allison Reed (Oscar-nominee Julianne Moore) are then sent to stop the alien race from expanding to the rest of the country. And that's where the hilarity begins.

All in all, Evolution might be ridiculous in some areas, but other than that its a rather hilarious flick from the director of Ghost Busters. If you enjoyed GB, you'll love Evolution!",1354060800,,1026,4.758426966292135

What I really love about this movie is that it doesn't try too hard to be funny like other overly silly comedy movies.  There is a great mix of stupidity humor and quirky humor so you aren't left feeling the same punch line numerous times.  They also do attempt to ass some realism to the movie, and try to make it believable.  There are some chemistry and evolution references in this movie.  It's not accurate but used as a way to relate the story to the audience, which I think works out great.

As for the effects, it is a 11 year-old movie so don't expect it to look like Avatar.  If you find the special effects a bit cheesy, great! That is what it's supposed to be.  I don't want to give out spoilers but there is a scene in there that reminds me of the Nickelodeon show where they pour goo all over your head.

1654075,4,B00005R874,"I saw the symbol for this movie -- a smiley with three eyes -- years ago, but never knew what it was about. Now I think I want a tee shirt with it on.

Young Wayne (Seann William Scott) is out in the Arizona desert practicing for his fireman's exam when a meteor comes down right on his classic car. Fortunately, he was not in it at the time, but he has to be credited with the initial discovery.

By the time Ira (David Duchovny) and Harry (Orlando Jones), two professors at the local community college get there, the meteor is already covered with some sort of growth, and when they chip into it, the rock bleeds. They take a sample back to Ira's lab, and discover that there are microorganisms in the sample that are multiplying like crazy. Ira states that they have ten pairs in their DNA; life on earth only has four. Therefore, these are clearly aliens.

But by the time he brings Ira back to his lab to have a look, they are already evolved into multicellular organisms, and they keep on evolving with amazing rapidity. So I suppose it should be no surprise that when they return to the landing site, the US military is all over it, along with Allison, a pretty lady from the Center for Disease Control (Julianne Moore), and they are no longer welcome on the site.

Things go from bad to worse rapidly, with our heroes fighting against the military and bureaucrats to hopefully keep some credit for the discovery for themselves, and later because it's pretty obvious that General Woodman (Ted Levine) hasn't a clue as to the science involved.

Two other people may look familiar. One is Governor Lewis, played by Dan Aykroyd. The other is Ira's ex-wife Denise, played by Sarah Silverman.

The story is a great blend of science fiction and comedy, which might be expected of the likes of Dan Aykroyd. And yes, they manage to safe the world from the alien takeover.

I've never been a fan of Bill Murray's smarmy style, though I'd never say he wasn't fun. Reitman comes up with a new idea, as a follow up idea but not a sequel or remake. There was actually very little to remind me of Ghostbusters. Evolution is a fun romp, with silly dialogue and a far-fetched plot. As in all of Reitman's films, the entire cast (and crew) totally buy in to the proceedings to create an enjoyable sci-fi comedy that moves quickly and entertains. The film stands on its own and doesn't beg comparisons. David Duchovny, Orlando Jones, Julianne Moore, Ted Levine, Sarah Silverman and Dan Aykroyd. as well as everyone else, play it as if nothing could be more fun. Seann William Scott is terrific.

1654088,2,B00005R874,"I guess this is what happens when you replace Bill Murray with David Duchovny.

I believe Ivan Reitman's biggest hits were STRIPES and GHOSTBUSTERS (and I think he also made Murray's first film, MEATBALLS).  For GHOSTBUSTERS, he was working from a Dan Aykroyd script (originally written for John Belushi), so I kept thinking that professional comedians were sadly missing from EVOLUTION.  Instead, he had professional actors and they really exposed the weaknesses in the writing.  A ""Saturday Night Live"" crew would have, hopefully, been able to gloss over that.

The film has a good idea in a meteorite crash landing on earth and sprouting an entire alien eco-system.  But almost immediately the script's many clinkers and holes threaten the film more than the monsters threaten the world.  The script has to work really hard to keep Stiffler from AMERICAN PIE in the story--and he's not that funny.

As the film progresses, I was trying to figure out just what the three guys were.  Community college scholars?  The Three Stooges?  ANIMAL HOUSE rip-offs?  And how did they get a real actress like Julianne Moore to play the comedy bimbo?  She starts out like a serious scientist and, inexplicably, falls for David Duchovny.

The Duchovny-Moore relationship is lame.  The shopping mall sequence is completely laughless.  The crudest gags might've worked in a funnier movie.

I have since seen the film again (on cable) and it certainly has its moments, but this film does seem rather cheap in comparison to many other comedies out there.  The jokes seem almost too obvious and in the end too `gross' for their own good.  I love Julianne Moore and find Orlando Jones to be a gifted comedian, but this material fails them in many ways.  The special effects are nice (for the time) but there really isn't enough substance here to validate repeated viewings.",1277078400,3,868,4.468354430379747
1654091,3,B00005R874,"""Evolution"" is a comedy starring David Duchovny, Dan Aykroyd, Seann William Scott and Julianne Moore (an otherwise serious actress). The man behind the movie is Ivan Reitman, which may explain why some of the monsters in ""Evolution"" look suspiciously similar to the ghosts in ""Ghostbusters"", another Reitman classic.

""Evolution"" is very light entertainment. Every other joke contains juvenile references to sex, fecal matter or nude behinds. As usual, the main character has a funny African-American sidekick. Also as usual, there is a smart female scientist involved, plus a whole lot of really stupid army officers and...of course, a state governor! Frankly, we've seen this before. The high school students are also stereotyped, including the stupid blonde girl and the two fat dorks (who naturally turn out to be heroes).

Is this funny? I think it depends on what mood you're in when watching it. The movie isn't badly produced, and the actors are all top of the class. But yes, if you want more substance or don't get the parody part, you might want to scream!

The plot is fairly straight forward. A meteorite collides with Earth. Or is it Arizona? The slime of the meteorite quickly evolves into monstrous fish, flying dinosaurs and blue (!) ape-men with a penchant for skull bashing. The dinosaur flies into a shopping mould and creates the usual panic. The military are called in and attempt to stop the monsters with napalm, which naturally gets the exact opposite effect. Eventually, the world is saved when the two fat bozos reveal that the monsters can be defeated by spraying them with Head & Shoulders shampoo!

OK, that was a new angle. I think.

In my opinion, ""Evolution"" isn't the best movie, or even comedy-parody, around. But as light Friday night entertainment, I guess it's alright.",1260662400,2,1807,5.01

What an excellent comedy.  David Duchovny was surprisingly adept at comedy, especially the low key, intellectual stuff, balanced by Orlando Jones for more down-to-earth humor, Julianne Moore as an uncoordinated but serious scientist, and Sean William Scott for the the really bawdy, slapstick stuff.  Not a combination of actors I would normally have considered, but performed brilliantly together.

This movie is not comedy for the lowest common denominator, and therefore a pleasant relief from the run of the mill productions these days.  The premise is simple; panspermia strikes again (and if this makes no sense to you, pass on this movie).  An alien single-cell organism rides to Earth on a meteor, but has a much faster life cycle than any Earthly organism.  And it is adapting quickly.  And then the problem gets worse; the government gets involved.

Great visual comedy, great dialog, a little coarse in places, and great fun.  Worth watching, and worth watching the alien environment scenes a second time to pick up on all the detail.

1654162,1,B00005R874,"""Evolution"", the latest film from director Ivan Reitman, has a handful of funny lines, but ultimately the film should be called ""Regression"".

Wayne Green (Seann William Scott), a wannabe fireman, is out in the Arizona desert, practicing for his big exam. Just as he sets a little shack on fire, a meteor hits. Harry Block (Orlando Jones, still best known as the '7-Up Guy' despite a handful of feature film roles), the community college geology professor, drags his friend, Ira Kane (David Duchovny), the community college biology professor, to the site. Kane soon realizes that the meteor contains organisms which are evolving very rapidly. Three days later, little alien creatures have begun to appear. The Army soon takes over and Dr. Allison Reed (Julianne Moore), of the CDC, becomes an unwitting liaison between the professors and the government. Soon, things get out of hand.

The story sounds promising. It could make a great summer comedy in the vain of ""Ghostbusters"", perhaps Reitman's most famous film. It has all of the elements of ""Ghostbusters"": otherworldly creatures, smart-alecky adults, some funny lines, loads of special effects. This is where the problem lies. ""Evolution"" simply recycles all of these characteristics without adding a new dimension. Duchovny plays the Ackroyd and Ramis roles, Jones the Murray role, Scott the Moranis role and Moore plays a pale comparison of the Sigourney Weaver role. ""Evolution"" also lacks a crucial element: character development.

Kane starts out as the scientific, smart, wise-cracking professor. At the end of the film, he is the same character. Throughout the film, we are supposed to recognize that he and Dr. Reed have a building sexual attraction. As neither character evolves, how can a relationship build between them. They start out as adversaries and don't seem to grow any closer.

The biggest flaw with all of the characters is that they are all the same. Good guys and villains alike are all bumbling, stupid and reckless. The trailer for the film contains a shot of Julianne Moore stumbling on some steps. This is repeated at least four times in the film. This is her major comedic contribution to the film. Scott has made a career of playing characters that have less than a full deck. He doesn't really add anything to the character this time. Jones has the majority of the funny lines, but many of the lines are based on character flaws which are really not given any depth. Bill Murray's Peter Venckmann was an extremely smart-alecky skirt chaser. The first scene featuring his character shows him testing a nerd and a beautiful student. The situation is hilarious. Remarkably, ""Evolution"" introduces Jones' character in much the same way with poor results.

As I watched ""Evolution"", I wondered how a film about aliens evolving very quickly could feel so long. I have to fault director Reitman for this. The film seems to plod along. Its difficult to pinpoint exactly why, but I have the sense that Reitman was going through the motions. There is very little sense of energy as the characters are running around.

""Evolution"" also features one of the strangest product placements I have ever seen. ""Pearl Harbor"" had Coke bottles used for IVs. ""Evolution"" has... Well, to reveal it would spoil the ending. Hollywood seems to be in a phase in which they believe that a product placement is OK, as long as you make fun of it.

1654170,4,B00005R874,"Despite all the lukewarm reviews, poor box-office take, and Men In Black comparisons, I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to just about anyone I know. Its premise is clever and interesting, the script is witty, the special effects are great, the chemistry between the lead actors is excellent -- in other words, it's near-perfect entertainment, with just the right balance of laughs, scares, action, and intriguing science fiction.

 I know, I'll admit I sound like some dorky local TV station ""movie critic"" who rates films with a numeric amount of popcorn buckets or film reels. Some people may think I hate just about everything, especially from a director like Ivan Reitman, or an obvious product of the corporate Hollywood studio system, but I assure you I'm not a complete jerk. I know there is a need for harmless entertainment, and will be the first one to admit that I often rent a cliched chick flick, frat-boy comedy, mindless action drivel, or a squeaky-clean family comedy. I work all day. Some nights I don't feel like evaluating symbolism, soaking in ambience, or reading subtitles. Sue me.

 And with that, I'll say this: Evolution is one of the most underrated movies of the last few years. It is harmless entertainment that actually works.

 David Duchovny and Orlando Jones (much funnier and less irritatingly obvious than Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith) are a pair of community college teachers who discover that a recently fallen meteor is crawling with single-celled organisms. As you should be able to conclude from the film's title, the organisms evolve quickly: first into worms, then bugs, amphibians, reptiles, and soon dinosaur-like creatures and primates. This all happens within a matter of days, instead of billions of years, posing a huge threat to humans. Julianne Moore is along in a rare light role, but plays it flawless as always. I could've done without Seann William Scott as the typically moronic poolboy who discovers the meteor, but we all know Hollywood likes to attract as many demographics as possible.

 Of course, it didn't work for Hollywood, but I enjoyed myself.",1090454400,4,2127,5.005665722379604

It's a fun and lighthearted movie.  The special effects are quite good, the monsters are impressive and the acting is not bad.  David Duchovny isn't a great commedian, and some of his lines are terrible, but overall, he does a good job.
It's the kind of movie you put on when you are depressed and just want to drink a beer and be amused.  In the same league as Caddyshack and Stripes.  Great mindless fun.",1087430400,2,553,4.425742574257426

The X-FILES star did well enough in the feature-length film of that series, but other than that, he's floundered.  EVOLUTION does have some wonderfully wacky moments, and some brilliant special effects.  What it lacks is a consistency in tone and a good team of actors.  Julianne Moore is hilarious as the clumsy CDC rep; Orlando Jones is as effective as Ernie Hudson has been; and Seann William Scott does his usual goofus stint.  Ted Levine is very good as the greedy general, and Dan Akroyd is wasted in his role as the governor.

1654193,4,B00005R874,"Let's be entirely honest here, ""Evolution"" is a silly movie based upon a barely palpable grasp on science.  However, it doesn't matter because it is genuinely entertaining.  The plot is just plausible enough to allow the viewer to enjoy a great cast offering up some genuinely funny lines amidst some very good CGI (and I write this two years after the film was released).
The story revolves around rapidly evolving alien life forms that arrive in Arizona via a meteorite.  This nod to the theory of Panspermia shows that while the link to real science may be tenuous, it won't be severed altogether.  This is an element that the viewer comes to appreciate as it allows a reasonable suspension of disbelief, which adds to the movie's appeal.
As these ""aliens"" become more sophisticated they wreak a rapidly escalating amount of havoc on a nearby medium sized city.  It is here that our rag-tag band of heroes, David Duchovny as a disgraced biologist, Orlando Jones as a geologist who is more interested in anatomy than rocks, Julianne Moore as a hard driving CDC researcher and Seann William Scott as...well, Seann William Scott, come to the rescue.  OF course, along the way they face the requisite bone-headed general, not to mention the rigors of a Division III women's volleyball schedule.  Nonetheless, they rally together and triumph in fine style.  The reason why this journey is fun to watch is simple: while each one of these actors offers up an excellent performance (particularly impressive given Moore and Duchovny aren't known for comedy), it is as an ensemble that they really shine.  In particular, the exchanges between the three men are always hilarious as Duchovny plays a perfect straight-man for Jones and Scott.  Moreover, Moore shows a remarkable ability for prat-falls that are the highlight of some strong physical acting.
As the film progresses to an inevitable showdown with the aliens, the viewer is treated to more great performances from the supporting cast, including a cameo from Dan Akroyd that is perfectly delivered.  At the same time, the effects, which are contemporaneous with ""Jurassic Park II"" still view well, even if they aren't cutting edge.  In particular, there is a dragon -type creature that ranks among the best CGI creations I have encountered (pre-Gollum of LOTR, of course).
Finally, unlike far too many DVD's, ""Evolution"" offers a great value in terms of quality and extras.  The sound and picture are both excellent, but that is becoming more of the norm than the exception.  Where the disc really shines is in the bonus features.  The deleted scenes are well chosen and include commentary that offers an interesting look at the film making process.  Moreover, storyboards, commentary and visual effects features all make for an entertaining, interesting viewing experience.
What this review really comes down to is this: if you don't appreciate silly humor, if you pick apart movies for the slightest flaws, skip ""Evolution"", you won't like it.  Conversely, if you enjoy the give and take that comes from a cast that obviously enjoys working together, if you appreciate good special effects, and if a good ""popcorn"" movie is what you crave, ""Evolution"" is right up your alley.  I've watched it literally dozens of times and I never get tired of it.  It's eminently quotable, fun to watch, and makes great use of its cast, and silly or not, is a movie I never get tired of.
Enjoy!

1654194,3,B00005R874,"It's clear that as long as Ivan Reitman works in sci-fi comedy he will never achieve the greatness he did with Ghostbusters. That movie was a masterpiece of genius. Evolution is nothing but a fun ride that comes nowhere near the class of Ghostbusters. But it's still well worth it.
Weird really when you consider that Ghostbusters: Go to Hell, the second sequel in which hell got so full that spirits started spilling out into the real world, was re-written and redrafted that it became this...something completely different. You probably know the story. A meteor crash lands in the desert and the single celled organisms living on it very, very quickly become multi celled and then little worm creatures and then...many other things. The movie repeatedly calls them aliens but since they evolve from nothing on earth and are conditioned by earth's environment they are, effectively, earth creatures. Watching them run riot and cause havoc is the main fun of this film.

Ghostbusters had a dry, sarcastic sense of humor, like a fine wine. Evolution has a crude, gross-out sense of humor like American Pie, which seriously lessens the overall quality of the film. The lead trio of actors perform rather well together. Duchovny is much looser and easy-going here than his stiff, X-Files character. Seann William-Scott once again plays a dufus but he's more endearing here than he has been in other roles. Orlando Jones is kind of good but he too often takes his role in the stereotyped 'only black guy in a white movie' direction. Sadly though, Julianne Moore's accident-prone scientist just isn't funny and her clumsiness seems false and forced.
But obviously when you judge Evolution next to something better it seems an inferior movie. Judge it on it's own terms and you'll definitely enjoy. The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen (though it really could have benefited from a scope 2.35:1 aspect ratio) and is in rather lacklustre Dolby 5.1",1071273600,3,1946,4.987692307692308

And by the way the special features are great!,1069804800,,343,3.8450704225352115
1654196,3,B00005R874,"Evolution, while a very slick movie, ultimately fell flat for me.  I love good science fiction movies and I love good comedy movies, but in this case two great tastes did not go great together.
This movie stars David Duchovny (Dr. Ira Kane), Julianne Moore (Dr. Allison Reed), Orlando Jones (Prof. Harry Block), and Seann William Scott (Wayne Grey) and while I am sure all four actors were happy to work with such an accomplished director, Ivan Reitman, I wonder if they were equally pleased with the final product.  As far as the actors' performances, Duchovny played his part pretty well, while Jones seemed to go overboard as the comic sidekick.  Moore seemed a little out of place compared to some of her other roles, and I kind of felt sorry for Seann (no, I am not misspelling his name as it really has two n's at the end of it.  What's up with that?) William Scott in that his character was so moronic.  I felt he could have offered a lot more to this movie, given a chance.
In the beginning (no, not that beginning), we see a meteor slam into the Earth, and soon discover that it's teeming with alien life.  The alien microorganisms start growing and evolving at an exponential rate, creating some rather nasty life forms.  Ira and Harry, who both work at the local community college, are the first scientists on the scene.  Their discovery and dreams of fame and fortune go down the tubes as the government arrives on the scene and assumes control of the situation.  Dr. Reed, a member of the CDC, working with the government, begins to find herself at odds with the military and they way they're handling the infestation, and slowly starts to align herself with Ira and Harry.  Seems like a pretty standard sci-fi plot, but did I mention this is also a comedy?
Evolution follows the formula of Ghostbusters, one of Reitman's biggest hits, but the comedic chemistry between the actors in this movie just doesn't seem to gel like it did with the stars of Ghostbusters.  I read that this was at one time a straight up science fiction movie, until Reitman got hold of the script and rewrote it, adding the comedy elements.  I would have liked to see this movie before that happened, see what could have been.
The special effects are really good, providing lots of gooey alien stuff, and interesting looking creatures, but all that seemed a little wasted in this movie.  You can see the movie is based on science fiction, with the comedy forced into the picture like a square peg into a round hole.  Some parts were pretty funny, but I think the mix is a hard one to make work, and the effort fell flat.  Another reviewer mentioned Tremors, a movie where these two elements worked well together, creating a more palatable end result, and I would agree.
A decent effort, but not Reitman's best.  I think we've come to expect more from him based on his past efforts.  This movie has plenty of eye candy, but not a lot of substance.  It's easy to watch, geared more towards the not so discriminating viewer, but ultimately forgettable.",1064880000,2,3037,4.602968460111318
1654197,5,B00005R874,"This is a very funny movie.  I wouldn't exactly classify the idea behind it as an alien attack as a previous review has done.  It doesn't really involve a premeditated attack as much as it does survival of the fittest.
At any rate, this movie is a straight comedy and does not pose any philosophical questions or contain serious dialog.  I have seen this movie reviewed as being ""another such and such type of movie.""  I really found it to be quite original and clever.
The acting and effects are great, the casting is perfect, and the special features...aren't really that special.  This is definitely one of those comedies that you can pull out and laugh at again and again.",1060300800,,676,4.6
1654198,1,B00005R874,"Before anything, I have to point out that Reitman isn't a very skillful director. He can do some shabby work in his efforts to make crowd pleasing movies. Take the ""Ghostbusters"" movies. Not very well executed. But they succeed, thanks to some endearing characters. ""Evolution"" lacks such characters. So it falls flat on its face. Duchovny and Moore have lousy comedic delivery. He's certainly no Bill Murray, which is what the Kane role needed. But you must admit, Jones's delivery is impressive. Dan Aykroyd's minor role can't salvage things. Reitman's directorial faults are naked to the world. Granted, screenwriters Jakoby, Diamond and Weissman must take a large part of the blame and shame. But Reitman should have seen that script needed a huge rewrite before production. And you would have thought the Dreamworks gang would have exercised some judgement. But no. We sat and waited for two hours for a joke to work. But finally, the three-eyed smiley face came along to tell us we'd been had. The supernatural ""Ghostbusters"" required much less suspension of disbelief than this science themed movie. Those writers did much more homework than these. Loose ends flow though your fingers like the zillions of evolving flatworms. To think that the final explosion wiped out every last alien creature is the final insult. I won't bother with all the shows this rips off. That's been dealt with. We suffered through so much, waiting for something witty. But it never came. At least it wasn't a total failure. Thanks to ""Evolution,"" I discovered the lovely actress Sarah Silverman and the nifty band Self. But that's almost no consolation.

1654222,4,B00005R874,"""Evolution"" isn't the best sci-fi comedy ever, but it's certainly very good.  It's one of those guilty pleasure films that you enjoy over and over again.
The plot is nothing special.  Two community college professors (played by David Duchovny and Orlando Jones) discover that a meteor that crashed in the desert is teeming with life that is rapidly evolving.  The military comes in and screws things up, leaving the two profs, a government scientist (Julianne Moore), and a wannabe firefighter (Seann William Scott) to stop the alien menace before it takes over the world.  There's also a funny cameo by Dan Akroyd as the governor of Arizona.
The acting is good.  Duchovny and Jones have excellent chemistry together, really playing off each other well.  Duchovny plays more the sarcastic, cynical scientist, while Jones is more manic, particularly in a scene where they're in the cavern.  Moore is decent as a very clumsy and socially inept scientist.  Scott's a little flat as Wayne, but that's part of being a character who's dumb but trying to look smart.  There's also other bit players that are really funny, including two fat guys who are hysterical.
The story and script move along briskly, with only a few really unnecessary scenes.  The jokes comes at a similarly brisk pace and are very funny for the most part.  It's not a very realistic movie, as some of the things that are said and done are things most normal people wouldn't do, but that's part of the charm of this movie.
The effects are also very good for a movie that's more comedy than anything else.  Things really look very realistic and are on-par with a movie like ""Men in Black"" and ""Harry Potter"".
As far as extra go, there's not a whole lot.  Most of it has to do with the special effects, although you do get some funny deleted scenes.  The commentary track is the biggest treat, with Ivan Reitman, Duchovny, Jones, and Scott all in a room at once.  It's really funny.
Overall, this is a good film if you're just looking for some laughs.  It sort of has the charm of ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Men in Black"" with some great interplay between Jones and Duchovny.  Definitely a must-see if you're a ""Men in Black"" fan.",1048636800,2,2187,4.698162729658793

I will give the film credit, though, for being a perfect cross between an 80s college/party flick (example: the equally terrible ""Revenge of the Nerds II,"" III, etc.) and an imaginary X-Files episode where David Duchovny is drunk, high, or both. He is so terrible it's almost as if Agent Mulder has taken the weekend off, and has gone to play ""goofy scientist"" in a movie filmed on Fantasy Island. Julianne Moore is slumming big-time.

After all, it is not like Hollywood is a human or even a social institution and therefore is not going to be subject to natural laws or common sense.
Wayne Green (Scott) is out in the desert practicing saving an inflatable doll from a burning shack when a meteor comes to earth on top of his car.  Harry Block (Jones), a scientist from Glen Canyon Community College shows up to investigate in the name of the U.S. government and brings along Dr. Ira Kane (Duchovny), the head of the science department.  The meteor has ended up in an underground cavern when strange little things are growing.  Every time they come back to the cavern it is as if several millions years of evolution have taken place.  Kane and Block get excited, but then the feds and the army show up and spoil all the fun.  Moore, tired of being nominated for Oscars all the time, finds a role that requires her to fall down a lot in Allison Reed, a scientist affiliated with the army.  The boys want to keep investigating the evolving creatures but the feds have frozen them out, despite Allison's help.  In the best 1950s science fiction film tradition the military is completely wrong about how it is handling the aliens and the scientists are right, which means they are going to have to end up saving the day.
Even if ""Evolution"" had not been directed by Ivan Reitman or had Dan Ackroyd playing the Governor of Arizona, it would still remind most viewers of ""Ghostbusters.""  Kane and Block are a similar sort of tag team, able to talk knowledgebly about strange things beyond their experiences.  The biggest difference between the two films is that the special effects for the evolving alien creatures are a much bigger part of ""Evolution.""  The film becomes a series of alien encounters building up to the climax where our heroes have to take on the biggest alien monster of them all, at which point there is a rather inspired example of product placement.
We already know from ""The X-Files"" that Duchovny can do humor, so the problem here is not the acting but the script.  Jones has all the good one-liners although Duchovny gets the big stinker at the end when he saves his friend from a horrible fate.  The cast look like they had a good time making the film, but that must have been due more to their enjoyment of each other rather than of the script.  ""Evolution"" is one of those films where you say, okay, good first draft; now let us try to come up with something that would make a funny movie.  If there is always time for lubricant (you will understand when you watch the film), then there is always time to do a decent rewrite.  This is not so much a bad movie as it is one that is just not good.  Still, it is a pleasant enough diversion for a rainy afternoon, although you would never want to be diverted from studying for a science test by such a film.",1045872000,,3219,4.531951640759931

David Duchovny, Orlando Jones, Julianne Moore - all good actors, all talented, and all capable (especially Jones) of being funny...Director Ivan Reitman, who has made some very funny films...Great special effects...  So where did 'Evolution' go wrong?
First of all, as many other reviewers have mentioned, the film is a complete (duplicate) of 'Ghostbusters,' which is fine, since it's Reitman's movie too.  I have no problem with that.  I DO have a problem with bad writing, bad jokes, and bad punch lines.  (You know the movie's in trouble when the best line is ""There's always time for a lubricant."")

They discover evolving life forms that crash-land on Earth from a meteor.  So far, so good.  The potential for great comedy is there, but Reitman misses so many opportunities, giving us scene after scene that we're already familiar with.  When you know what's about to happen and HOW it's about to happen, it's just not funny.
I think 'Evolution' could have worked better as an out-and-out farce or a spoof of sf movies in general.  But as another re-hash of 'Ghostbusters,' a movie nearly twenty years old, it falls flat on its three-eyed smiley face.

1654236,3,B00005R874,"It's clear Ivan Reitman was attempting to recreate the successful chemistry and paranormal story of his hit Ghostbusters (one of my favorite films) with Evolution. The twist this time? Instead of Ghosts, it's an alien invasion.
The film looked promising with David Duchovny somewhat mocking his Mulder character from the X-Files and a talented cast, but much of the wit, camaraderie and chemistry that the original Ghostbusters had is lost in this film.
The characters are all obvious rehashes of each of the ghostbusters. Seann William Scott plays the Ray (Dan Aykroyd's character); David Duchovny and Orlando Jones take turns filling in for Peter and Egon (Bill Murray and Harold Ramis) and Julianne Moore fills in for Dana (Sigourney Weaver). But this time around, the chemistry is not quite there. Plus, Bill Murray really carried the humor of Ghostbusters, and none of the one liners in Evolution come close to Murray's.
All is not lost, though. The special effects are impressive, and it is fun to see Duchovny doing comedy. Also, Dan Aykroyd's supporting role is fun, especially since the Ghostbuster quality of this film is so obvious.
But overall, this film made me want to fish out my Ghostbusters DVD to wash out the bad taste of Evolution. Worth a rental, but nothing more.",1031097600,,1285,4.981395348837209

But not since ""Ghostbusters"" had Reitman been able to create a [bottom-kicking] sci-fi comedy that GB had.  But why not do a ""Ghostbusters 3""?  Instead, he did ""Evolution"", an up-to-date sci-fi comedy that has pretty much the same root plots as ""Ghostbusters"" had...well, except for Bill Murray hilarious punchlines, awesome proton packs, or even ghosts!  Instead, Murray is replaced by an crude, but not unfunny Orlando Jones, and such memorable moments like when Murray's character is slimed by Slimer, we instead get a god-awful shot of David Duchovny's bare buttocks...oh, yeah, and a giant alien creature getting an enema by a fire hose full of Head N' Shoulders.  This is not memorable.  Rather than ghosts, we get odd looking aliens that most of them where obviously inspired by movies, like ""Congo"", ""Lost in Space"" and even ""The Matrix"".  Reitman makes a weird casting job, putting Duchovny and Jones as the heroes, Julianne Moore as a clumsy scientist and love intrest of Duchovny, Sean William Scott as the goofy comic relief, Ted Levine as that one guy in every sci-fi movie that always screws things up because he's cocky, ignorant, and is always competing against the protagonists and Dan Aykroyd makes a brief appearance as the governor of Arizona.

EVOLUTION is a poor-man's version of GHOSTBUSTERS. It has everything that GHOSTBUSTERS had (neat special effects; a large cast; Ivan Reitman) except for the humor. Without Bill Murray around, GHOSTBUSTERS probably would not have worked as well, and this 'film' is proof of that...
Duchovny should have stayed with the X-Files a bit longer, so that someone else could have been cast as his character. He didn't deserve this movie...

It has dopey dialogue, a poorly developed script, and a lousy score (which might've made it tolerable to listen to).  A ""comedy"" like this one is, definitely, ""not pretty"".
The characters are so stereotypical: Duchovny is the rebel scientist; Julianne Moore, the love interest that appears sexually frustrated; Orlando Jones, the sidekick; Ted Levine, the militaristic Army general who wants to ""nuke"" the alien invaders; Seann William Scott, the ""doofus""; Ethan Suplee and Michael Bower as the pudgy comic oafs that help save the day; and Dan Ackroyd as the frantic Arizona governor.
Yeah, a movie like this does not dwell on character development, but this one doesn't even have respect for the ones that it has.
Case in point: Jones's ""Harry Block"" appears to be an academic equal to Duchovny's ""Ira Kane"" at the film's start.  But, he gradually assumes the stature of a ""jive-talking, break-dancing, streetwise"" second banana that so many actors of color are relegated to playing.
The film also shows a lack of respect for its audience in the logic department.  In one scene, an enraged (although, probably confused) dragon-bird creature invades a shopping mall.  Patrons are seen standing and gawking or apparently going on with their buying instead of high-tailing it to the nearest exit.

1654252,2,B00005R874,"Evolution is one part Ghostbusters and one part Men in Black. This is an interesting recipe, but the resulting movie is not as tasty as one would like it to be. Its director, Ivan Reitman, actually was the man behind Ghostbusters. David Duchovny, of course, was one of the stars of TV's The X-Files. There are a lot of talented people involved in this project, both behind and in front of the camera, and they give it their best efforts. Once more, though, we have a script that is not strong enough to support all this talent.
The movie opens in the Arizona desert at night. Wayne [Seann William Scott] is out there with a mannequin and a can of gasoline practicing for his firefighter's exam. He sets an abandoned shack on fire and is about to 'rescue' the dummy when a meteor suddenly races from the sky, demolishes his car, and nearly kills him. The next day, Ira and Harry [Duchovny and Orlando Jones], professors at a nearby community college, go out to investigate. They discover a fluid leaking out of the cosmic object. Back at the college lab, they learn that there are organisms in the fluid, and they are reproducing rapidly. Before they know it, the army has taken over the site. Because this intrusion threatens Ira and Harry's chance at fame and fortune, they sneak into the cave the meteor wound up in. They find it filled with bizarre creatures who have quickly evolved from the liquid. These beasts may be cute and cuddly, but friendly they're not. Taking over the world seems to be the plan.
Duchovny is a great actor. It's unfortunate that he has not found a movie that mines his talents the way The X-Files did. Julianne Moore, who plays a doctor worjing with the army, is more or less wasted here, but at least she has some powerful films in her resume. Hopefully, Duchovny will have better luck in his future projects. The material is perfect for Orlando Jones and Seann William Scott, who have by far the best roles. They both have a chance to do some fine physical comedy. Dan Akroyd is fine as the governor of Arizona. His presence is also an inside joke. He starred in Ghostbusters.
On the whole, Evolution is harmless, likable fun, although its intended audience is a bit of a mystery. It veers abruptly between comedy and horror. It's a little too intense for kids and a little too silly for adults. I suspect this is the primary reason it failed in theaters. The creatures are marvelous to look at, but they don't really do anything in particular, except to grow very fast and eat each other.

Everything else is the same Hollywood machinery grinding out the same plot lines you've seen over and over again.  You've got the bad-guy scientific community that rejects the good-guy findings.  You've got the bad-guy military community that rejects the good-guy findings, and of course takes the most dangerous turn.  You've got to find time to get a romance going between the two most attractive people in the film, while everybody else might as well be eunuchs (I don't understand the appeal of Orlando Jones, but he in the role of Tonto is a good example).
And of course, Hollywood continues it's current trend of making up for years of not having bodily function jokes by laying them on you every chance they get.

From actors to writers to directors and special effects guys to music and sound effects this is a waste of time for everyone.

Throughout the entire movie, Dochovny delivers lines like Fox Mulder. Jones delivers lines like 7-Up man. S W Scott delivers lines like Stiffler... but was just not as funny as Stiffler. These one-dimensional, typecast buffoons were the perfect stars for this film, and I'm sure they were all in mind for the parts long before casting agents were ever considered.

This movie was deplorable. It took everything I didn't like about Ghostbusters (and that's not a lot), and everything I didn't like about Men In Black (there was plenty I didn't like about Men In Black), added some bad special effects, threw in a modest Jay-and-Silent-Bob-sized collection of immature jokes, and finihed it off with some dialogue that was apparently written by junior high school remedials. (""Give me back my friend, you giant sphincter!""). The only line I found funny enough to laugh at was when Orlando Jones screamed ""THERE'S ALWAYS TIME FOR LUBRICANT!"" I could sympathize with that line because the producers of Evolution did not use any lubricant on the poor souls who actually paid money to see it. ....

Don't look for ""hard science"" here; the ""science"" is as spoofy as anything else about the film. But this is about the most fun I've seen in a science fiction / comedy movie in a long time. What a fortuitous film for several of its performers. David Duchovny needed to show that there's life after X-Files, and he does so with flying colors. Julianne Moore needed to bounce back from her doomed attempt to make HANNIBAL work -- an all to easy to scapegoat role. Both she and Jodie Foster are capable actresses, but just weren't born to play the same character. Julianne Moore needed a recovery from being left in that unfair lurch (after all who's to say that Jodie Foster could have done any better if she'd been the one to go second in that role). And in EVOLUTION, Julianne delivers along with the rest of the cast. Even Sean William Scott, so unenviably typecast as an idiot, gets to put something of a variant twist on that persona and get the last laugh this time. Too many movies today try to juggle action, human drama and (sometimes) comedy, and as often as not those disparate elements stumble over one another rather than meshing. But here's a delightful relief from all that. Even if comedy reigns supreme in EVOLUTION, the characters are memorable and likeable, and interesting plot twists leave it by no means short on action as well in this seamless whole.",1011398400,,1516,4.618518518518519

From a bleeding rock, to mulitcellular organisms, to plant moss, to species, to worms, to bugs, to dragons, to primates, this evolving mutant species could wipe out human existence within three months of its arrival.  Now Duchovony, Jones, Scott, and Moore must come together to find a repellent to wipe out the aliens before the human race is extinct.
This plump and absolutely fun comedy is presented with great performances to back it up.  Sure, the film is goofy, but packs the laughs.  The film is a sure treat for everyone.  There isn't much detail to go into.  It was better than expected.
QUOTE: ""Uproarious, hilarious, and fun are the three words I choose to describe this spoof.  It's rather dumb, but it is brutally and terminally funny.  The performances add a lot to it, while the visual effects aren't real convincing.  But I'll take it for what it is, and have fun with it.  Reitman's new Alienbusters film turned out to be a sure shining crystal stone, rather than a tombstone.""",1011398400,,1664,5.122222222222222

1654271,1,B00005R874,"Ok. Let me get down to business. Darwin was wrong. Had evolution truly existed, this stinker would have gone the way of the dinosaur.
Ivan Reitman has lost his touch. ""Evolution"" is not another ""Ghostbusters"" as many people have said, but instead a sorry mess of ""Men in black"" ""Mars attacks"" and ""Dude, where's my car?""-ish scenes.
David Duchovny plays Ira Kane, a failed biologist, who discovers a life form that crashed in the Arizona Desert on a meteor. (Keep in mind that we later find out that Kane's experimental anthrax vaccine gave a couple thousand soldiers erectile dysfunction, so we know it'll be immature)  Along with a babe-chasing geologist, Dr. Block (Orlando Jones) and a country-club crackhead, Wayne (Sean William Scott) Kane tries to stop the alien life-form from evolving into cheesy creatures that take over the city. Eventually it evolves into worms, insects (of which one is removed from Dr. Block's rectum in a ridiculous ""Matrix""-style sequence.) and dragon-like creatures that rampage shopping malls. Alison Reed (Julianne Moore) plays the film's sex object- a garter-belt-wearing dumb blonde scientist who falls over in nearly every scene in which she appears.  She joins the trio in what has to be one of the worst scientific fallacies made. A useless student protest, a romance with the chemistry of a couple of boiled cabbages, Dan Ackroyd as an incompetant fascist governor who has the strange authority to call in the army to pump the meteor's cave full of napalm, Duchovny's childlike use of the periodic table and the way biologists are stereotyped as a bunch of woman-chasing boneheads had me ranting, not laughing.  The movie is also full of canonical teenage jokes- The occasional boob crack or racial slur, and an absulutely stupid scene at the end in where our science geniuses, assisted by two fat flunkouts, give a giant mutated blob an enema with dandruff shampoo. Ivan Reitman, who directed some brilliant movies,  is ready to direct low-budget sitcoms after this. And congratulations, Mr. Duchovny, you just shot your career in the gonads. A waste of time, a waste of money, and a waste of film constitutes what I'd call the quintessential ""De-evolution"" of filmmaking.",1010448000,11,2215,5.076923076923077
1654272,2,B00005R874,"""Evolution"" is Ivan Reitman's wan attempt to replicate the formula of his most successful film, 1984's ""Ghostbusters.""  In this film, David Duchovny, Orlando Jones, Seann William Scott and Julianne Moore portray the oddball foursome who uses its wit and ""expertise"" to help eradicate an otherworldly menace.  Instead of ghosts, in ""Evolution"" we have a host of single-celled aliens who crash land in the Arizona desert aboard a flaming meteorite.  The problem is that these organisms seem to have the ability to evolve to higher life forms in a radically sped-up time frame and, in no time at all, the Southwest desert - and soon the whole world - stand in deadly peril of being overrun by this invading force from another planet.
""Evolution"" is a mediocre attempt to parody those cheesy sci-fi monster flicks of the 1950's, right down to the discovery of the one chemical that turns out to be the creatures' Achilles Heal.  Of course, the special effects are far more impressive in this film than they ever were in any of those earlier works - which goes to prove that, when it came right down to it, even the makers of this multi-million dollar summer blockbuster didn't have the nerve to go all the way with the parody, possibly risking a loss on their investment (the film was a disappointment at the box office and lost money anyway).  In fact, if anything, the special effects end up burying the humor of the film -which isn't all that rich to begin with.  The jokes are often crude and juvenile and much of the film's running time is spent trying to up the ""ick"" factor through the disgusting nature of the creatures that develop.  The film often succeeds in that respect.  Of the performers, Jones and Scott are given the most material to work with in creating comic characters.  Duchovny and Moore are basically relegated to thankless straight-man status.  ""Ghostbusters"" veteran, Dan Akroyd, provides some genuine laughs as the bombastic and pompous governor of the state.
There really isn't much to say about ""Evolution"" - except to say that there isn't much to say.  It's watchable but hardly memorable and fails to fulfill its potential of becoming a hip sci-fi comedy on the order of, say, ""Men in Black.""  Reitman does better when his threats come from right down here on earth.",1010361600,2,2293,4.806615776081425

Even that guy, with the three names, who was in American Pie and Road Trip, was very funny in this as well.

1654274,3,B00005R874,"This is a film with an identity crisis.  Director Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters, Meatballs, Twins, Kindergarten Cop) can't seem to make up his mind if he wants it to be a straight science fiction flick or a parody.  The result is a film that is far too goofy to be good science fiction and nowhere near funny enough to be good comedy.
A great cast is wasted on a script that lays one unfunny egg after another.  The only one able to squeeze any comedy out of his lines is Orlando Jones.  David Duchovny and Julianne Moore mostly try to play it straight other than a moon shooting by Duchovny and a bunch of pratfalls by Moore.  Ted Levine plays his part as too much of a doofus.  Seann William Scott is occasionally so bizarre that it is humorous, but mostly his character is more stupid than funny.
The one strength of the film is the visual effects.  The monsters are innovative and realistic.  The scene where the flying reptile is terrorizing the shopping mall is particularly good.
I rated this film a 6/10 on the strength of the creatures.  It seems like it may have been written as straight sci-fi and Reitman (more of a comedy director) futilely tried to change its direction.  The result fell flat and hung a lot of talented actors out to dry.",1010188800,,1249,4.462555066079295
1654275,3,B00005R874,"With a star-studded cast of likeable actors, and a director heralded for his work on ""Ghostbusters"" and various other successful comedies, ""Evolution"" had all the makings of an enjoyable comedic escape from the summer drivel and lackluster blockbusters. The good news: the special effects are well-crafted, the creatures amusing, and the acting soars. The bad news: the film is not nearly as funny as it should be, and aside from a few chuckles, it's lacking in laughs and humor.
The movie contains elements of slapstick, situational humor and gross-outs, centering around a story hook that begins when a small meteor strikes in the deserts of Arizona and is stumbled upon by college science professors Ira Kane and Harry Block (David Duchovny and Orlando Jones), who protest the involvement of the federal government, led by Kane's rival, General Woodman (Ted Levine). Woodman, along with CDC official Allison Reed (Julianne Moore), take over the project, and soon the evolving creatures that arrived on the meteor begin to wreak havoc on the citizens of nearby towns, leaving our rag-tag team of scientists to stop them.
This is all Reitman's territory, and for the most part, he does remarkably well in making a ludicrous story enjoyable (think of it as ""Galaxy Quest"" in the desert). The plot moves along a familiar path the provides us some nice-looking special effects and creature creations that aren't convincing, but have no reason to be; these effects prove to be the most fun you'll get out of the experience.
The cast also provides small moments of humor, including a full-view shot of Duchovny's backside, who plays Ira Kane like Fox Mulder on helium. Moore is exceptionally entertaining as the clumsy love interest for Kane, and looks like she's having a lot of fun. It's good to see Orlando Jones make a good comeback from his role earlier this year in ""Say It Isn't So,"" and Seann William Scott charms us as an aspiring fireman who discovers the asteroid.
All of these aspects in place, the film had set a course for a great deal of comedy, though it lacks the serious laughs and gut-busting fits needed to make it a good film. A extraction of an alien insect from Dr. Block by way of his rectum is hilarious, as is a stint involving a sad-eyed alien who instantly goes awry, and the use of Head-and-Shoulders shampoo as a way of combating the new arrivals. Unfortunately, these laughs come at intervals of about twenty minutes, with long periods of boredom and disinterest to fill in the holes.
The fact of the matter is that ""Evolution"" should have been funnier, and deserved to be, in a way. It had all the perks of a good comedy: a good cast, likeable characters, and a plot that is silly enough to provide some hearty laughs and a pleasant diversion from reality. Reitman's heart is in the right place, but he seems to have lost his knack for comedy, and the result is a film that will provide some small measure of entertainment on a rainy afternoon, but little else.",1010102400,2,2989,4.783365570599613

1654277,4,B00005R874,"No Ghostbusters 3? That causes sadness. But getting a movie that is very similiar to the franchise and is directed by the director of the Ghostbusters films causes happiness. Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters, Ghostbusters 2) directs Evolution, the story of a group of thrown together people who must destroy a new race of creatures that has evolved from a meteor that crashed into earth before the world is taken over.
 The story, while flat in some areas, is interesting. The positions of the main characters made the story go along. The actors did a great job. Julianne Moore was cute as the clumsy scientist lady who must choose to either go along with the government and screw up, or go along with the other group and save the world. David Duchovny and Orlando Jones play two college professors who impersonate whatever they can to get to the meteor. Orlando Jones was hilarious, and his flat tone of his one-liners made the one-liners better. Sean William Scott is the discoverer of the meteor. And groups up with the others after finding one of the creatures dead. In my opinion, Scott made the movie. He was  the lovable, funny dude of the movie. Much like Rick Moranis was of the Ghostbusters movies. And there's even a cameo from Dan Aykroyd which brightens the movie.
 I feel as if the DVD cheats out on some stuff they could have given us, but it fairs well. There are some deleted scenes. The only entertaining one was the alternate ending which was all about Orlando Jones. There is are some interesting photo galleries of the creatures created for the film. Those primates were pretty ugly. There's also a featurette and cast and crew biographies. I found it weird that the disc was lacking the theatrical trailer for the film.
 In the end, Evolution is a fun comedy that rides alongside Ghostbusters. Heck, we even get tons of slime near the end.",1009929600,,1855,4.6984615384615385

I was semi-disappointed in this movie because it is a direct rip off of Ghostbusters. You have the bumbling good guys that eventually save the day; the military are the bad guys that hamper the heroes at every turn, monsters (not ghosts) roaming the country side harassing the townspeople, the scientists running in at the last second to save the day.... And on and on and on, I have seen this before in Ghostbusters.
The movie itself has great special effects; interesting story line and David, Orlando, Seann and Julianne make a great comedic team.  There are some funny scenes especially with Orlando's sphincter fetish witch kept me laughing throughout the entire movie.  If you like Ghostbusters you should like this movie, plenty of special effects, technical jargon and some funny but crude scenes.
 The extras are pretty good including deleted scenes, a making of feature and don't miss the alternative ending, it's funnier than the movie ending. There has been talk of the picture being bad on the DVD copy of this movie, but I did not see any distortion at all. This DVD also comes in Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS which is always a plus!

While some of the alien creatures i ended up covering my eyes for, (i wouldnt let any child under 10 see this) they were very well done in their makeup, and made to look halfway comical to set the tone for the movie.

Ivan Reitman plays the teacher trying to keep his students in line, when all they want to do is play.  The Deleted Scenes are pretty good.  The Sarah Silverman scene and the alternate ending are the two best.
As for the movie, it trys to hard to be Ghostbusters.  At times it succeeds and at other times it falls flat on its face.

I was one of the few to see this in the theatre and I loved it.  Why it did so poorly at the box office, I have no idea.  But, this is without a doubt one of the funniest movies of the year.  David Duchovny (X-Files, Return to Me) has the perfect dry wit for his role as Ira Kane, a local college professor with a secret past.  Orlando Jones (The Replacements, 7-Up Spokesman) is incredible as the glory seeking community college professor Harry Block.

It's very funny, the characters are great, the story is quite amusing, and the movie doesn't take itself overly serious.  No, It's not going to win any Oscars, but how many comedies do?  Please go and see it for yourself before you let the critics talk you out of it.  It's a really good time.",1003190400,,711,4.2388059701492535

But at what cost? What this movie offered in substandard entertainment, it made up for in sheer badness! Of course it was funny, to a certain extent, but when I came out of the theatre, aside from my favorite X-Files star (who was really the only actor that truly understood combining a role with humor), I felt belittled, and even violated. The movie, like so many dumb teen movies (not to mention any sequels of the summer) felt so condescending in its very limited intelligence. Not since the dim-witted favorite Dumb and Dumber, have I felt so strongly the urge to voraciously read Tolstoy's (endless) 1000-page thriller (not really), War and Peace. So between David Duchovny, Orlando Jones (""Make 7--up yours), and the ever-increasingly versatile Sean William Scott (American Pie, American Pie 2, Dude Where's My Car...enough said), I was just begging for a 9 hour crash course in history from Mesopotamia to the present by a professor with the droning voice of Ben Stein (and not nearly as funny), just to make my brain feel alive again.

Those who go to the film expecting anything else (such as a science-fiction film with comic elements) will likely be disappointed; Evolution is to sci-fi as Ghost-Busters was to horror--the setting is only the premise through which the comedy is delivered.  And this is David Duchovny, Orlando Jones, and Seann William Scott (of Dude, Where's My Car and American Pie), so we're not talking high comedy here.  Those offended by scatological humor will find much to dislike.  But although I personally find most such humor simple-minded rather than offensive, there was much more to the movie that my family (including my 10 year old daughter and my 16 year old son) and I enjoyed tremendously.  The acting was good, the plot interesting--with a very amusing idea at the end, and the effects exciting.  The creatures were especially imaginative toward the beginning of the movie--toward the end they simply came to resemble traditional dinosaurs--and not too frightening for my daughter.  They had a certain muppet-esque feel to them--not inappropriate for a family film--and fans of Ghostbusters will recognize Slimer in the blue dog-like creature.

1654307,3,B00005R874,"Evolution is a movie about an alien life-form with an incredible evolution rate that crash lands onto our planet.  I personally think that is a pretty decent sci-fi spoof.  It has all the good elements needed to be one:
1) Good, funny actors.  One of the reasons I really liked the acting in this movie is that all the actors appeared to really have enjoyed making this movie - no one seemed determined to outshine the other, or to win an oscar.  David Duchovny, Orlando Jones and Seann William Scott made a humorous trio, although their scripts could have been touched up just a little bit more.  Julianne Moore however seemed to have served no purpose except as to help add a sexual element to the story - her character drew no laughter or even interest from me.
2) Cheesy script chock-full of scientific babble and crude-but-amusing jokes.  I found the plot very interesting, the delivery of the story to be entertaining, and I laughed often.  However, i think it could have used a little more humor, and I'm not sure if I was laughing because the jokes were truly funny or because the people I was with were laughing.  But regardless - there was laughter.
3) Imaginative special effects. Lots of creativity was put into designing the creatures at each evolutional state - my favorites were the primates and I wished that they had shown more of them.
Galaxy Quest, Men In Black, Ghost Busters, heck - even Spaceballs all had these elements.  Evolution may not be the most movie of all times, but in its genre it holds its ground.",993772800,4,1532,4.602941176470588

Orlando Jones is my new favorite funny man.  I have not seen him in very much, but I was impressed by his comedic timing.  Julianne Moore was at her best, radiant and a very good ""straight woman"".

Before this review starts sounding too pretentious, I'm going to cut it off and hit the highlights:
1) This movie is extremely funny. True, David Duchovny isn't Bill Murray, but then again, we can't go rating movies based on their Bill Murray content (That would put Wild Things higher than some of Kevin Bacon's more refined work--something that simply cannot be done.)
2) It's entertaining! Unlike most movies, I actually walked out of this one having had a thourougly good time. Sure, it had failings, but those couldn't detract from the sheer entertainment value.
3) Sure, the special effects are kinda transparent. The plot and cast manage to hold up just fine, and actually carry the show themselves--instead of falling back on crowd-pleasing effects shots.

1654317,2,B00005R874,"I took my father to see ""Evolution"" on Father's Day. It was basically a toss-up between that and ""Tomb Raider"". For the record, he chose this one. I was a tad disappointed walking out of the multiplex, one hour and forty minutes later.
The plot, in a nutshell: A ""meteor"" crash lands in Arizona. Two scientists (The X-Files's David Duchovny and early MadTV alum Orlando Jones, respectively) discover the rock is bleeding and is indeed a one-celled alien. On a later look, it's multi-celled. An alien creature that evolves at an extremely rapid rate. Surely these aliens will not take over the world, or will they? Joining Duchovny and Jones is clumsy Julianne Moore and braindead Seann William Scott, of ""American Pie"" fame. What ensues is an all-out battle to stop the aliens.
Note, this is a ""comedy"" from respected director Ivan Reitman, who directed such laugh-fests as ""Ghostbusters"". But this has nary a laugh in the 25 minute range. This movie would have worked a lot better if it were more funny and less dependant on gross-out stints. Although, there are a few other gripes...if you don't mind...
First the cast: You'd think that David Duchovny would want to back away from his Mulder image after graciously leaving the hit Fox show. But...instead he goes with his funny bones. You might be thinking, ""I did not know he was funny."" Well, to put it bluntly, he's not. He should have learned from the mistakes of fellow TV celeb David Caruso. But, in a move that caused many a groan, he depends on his film career outside the X-Files movie: surely you remember the box office dud ""Playing God"", right? I'm sure his agent is biting his lip of the #4 opening weekend.
Then there's the rest of the cast: Julianne Moore, an odd choice after ""Hannibal."" She also isn't very funny. Her character is clumsy...er...that's it. Seann William Scott is playing the idiot numbskull that's supposedly ""funny"", for which he's not. The only character that's even remotely humorous is Orlando Jones's scientist. Although stereotypically a ""jive turkey"", he does provide a few laughs.
A let down for me, this flick is. I'd been looking forward to it. It has what I call ""The Three Amigos Syndrome"". That's where the best jokes and bits are displayed in the trailer a la a notorious Steve Martin movie. The trailer looked good.
Out of the theater finally, my father despised the movie, giving it a D-. I was a bit more generous, giving it a C+, on account that it mildly entertained me. I thought the theatre pyrotechnics were mildly more amusing than the movie (don't ask.)Although I'm not a part of the generic audience, the twentysomethings. So that's it. Although, if you're searching for a second opinion, the two guys sitting behind me found almost everything hilarious.

Much of the dialog appears to have been written as a Jr. High drama class project. Sorry, but bathroom humor just doesn't do much for me anymore. Orlando Jones's character was simply too stupid for belief and David Duchovny looked as if he didn't expect half the audience to get the joke.
That said, there were some fine moments. I particularly enjoyed the sly poke at films contrived for product placement purposes. Despite the cardboard character, Orlando does have some fine one-liners and, as I've come to expect, he makes the most of them.
Then, there are the special effects. I can't say enough, so I won't even try. Much. I've become jaded in the past couple of years, but these really do stand out. The sequence in the shopping mall alone was worth the price of admission (I won't spoil it for you with details).

1654328,5,B00005R874,"Ivan Reitman, the creative director who brought us ""Ghostbusters"", has struck gold again with his newest comedy ""Evolution"". The film starts out with a meteor crashing into the desert in Arizona and two community college professors get a call to go and check out the site where the meteor crashed and investigate it. The two professors, Ira Kane and Harry Block(David Duchovny and Orlando Jones), break off a piece of the meteor and out comes some kind of blue liquid. As the scientists gather samples and study them, they realize that the liquid is made of organisms that can evolve at a rapid rate.  Thus begins the story of ""Evolution"" which is one of the best comedies I've seen in a long time. The film takes a somewhat serious situation about aliens taking over the planet and making it into a very creative and smart piece of filmmaking. The film works as a great comedy providing many laugh-out-loud scenes throughout. Also, the film provides a few scenes that will probably make you jump out of your seat. the film also contains some really good chemistry between thae characters, especially between Duchovny and Jones who became very good friends during production. Julianne Moore, who plays a government scientist provides many laughs based on how clumsy her character is. Seann William Scott(American Pie)plays a goofy wannabe firefighter who is the first one at the site when the meteor crashes into the earth and joins Duchovny and Jones in the quest to fight the aliens.  The movie is as creative and original as any comedy that has come out this year or within the past few years which is really saying something because there has not been a really great comedy like this to come out of Hollywood in a long time. The screenwriters David Diamond, David Weissman and Don Jakoby did a great job in giving the characters funny and sharp lines and also creating some very funny situations. Director Ivan Reitman also deserves major credit for creating a film that is both funny and a bit suspenseful at the same time and also very original and enjoyable. In addition, the special effects in the film are really spectacular. The man who worked on bringing the dinosaurs from ""Jurassic Park"" to life, Phil Tippett, did a remarkable job on creating some really original and realistic aliens for the film.  In conclusion, ""Evolution"" contains everything that is a good idea for a winning comedy: a good story, good characters and acting, some really unique and cool special effects as well as some really funny scenes. Anyone who wants to have a fun time at the movies should definitely check this one out.",992044800,6,2613,4.815144766146993
1654329,4,B00005R874,"Evolution... brings back some great memories, eh? No, but the movie had a high percentage of humour, which is something I always look for in my movies. David Duchovny played an ex-government agent rather well... any practise? Interesting topics were brought up in a discussion I had, such as""Would Selenium really work?"" a think-piece, with definte teenager/Duchovny-fans appeal.",992044800,,379,5.551724137931035

It is the best movie, even if you don't like David. I STRONGLY reccomend this movie. Get out there and see it! What are you waiting for?! I love this film!!",991958400,,305,4.016393442622951
1654331,2,B00005R874,"I was excited to see this movie.  The previews made it look like it could be a funny, Men in Black sort of thing.  It wasn't.  It was S T U P I D!  The jokes were forced and misplaced.  They were old and rehashed jokes from movies before.  The plot was extremely predictable, and lame.  The acting was rather poor, and the characters were poorly developed and not very likable.
I will admit I laughed a couple of times.  One being when Prof. Block was getting sucked up the anus of the large creature at the end.  Sick, yes, but funny.  But to wait through 2 hours of stupidity to get to that?  NOT WORTH IT.
Overall I was entertained by the visual effects, and the fun creatures they created.  But, it just wasn't worth it.  I'm glad it was a preview that I paid nothing for, or I would have been demanding my money back!
I give this movie 2 stars, only because I stayed entertained.  Mostly by the visuals.  Even though the visual of the flying dinosaur looking thing with the girl in its claws was some of the hokiest special effects ever...",991785600,5,1044,4.255102040816326

I watched the outtakes, and had to wonder why these were not part of the movie, that would have improved the movie quite a bit , like maybe a 3.5 stars or even to a 4 star.",1525824000,,335,4.014925373134329

7951904,4,B00005R874,"Yes, Evolution is a half-assed attempt by director Ivan Reitman at making another Ghostbusters (Dan Aykroyd even has a small role)no, I'm not exaggerating. You can find a Ghostbusters counterpart at just about every point in the movie: instead of ghosts, aliens. Instead of Stay-Puft marshmallows, Head & Shoulders shampoo. Instead of ""mother puss-bucket"", ""great googa-mooga"". The annoying/evil bureaucrat is a general instead of an EPA guy, and, in trying to have things his way, makes everything worse. You get the idea.

Despite all this, so help me, I can't help but enjoy it. The cast have great chemistry together, and it's that chemistry that elevates the movie above its failure to approach anything near Ghostbusters-like greatness. And it's got Wild Cherry's ""Play That Funky Music"".",1523491200,,794,5.301587301587301
