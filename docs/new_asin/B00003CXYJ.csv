8323786,5,B00003CXYJ,"A hard, hard film to watch. But I kept watching it. I had to remember in my own doings that our higher angels can prevail.

Devils transformed into angels. The aggrieved could and did forgive.

This story said that change is not enough. We must do the emotional work of changing, the hard inner struggle. They could do it. They did it. And so can we.",1376956800,3,350,4.287878787878788
8323787,5,B00003CXYJ,"I saw this at Sundance Film Festival years ago where it won Grand Jury Prize for best documentary and it still is with me today.  It is a story about forgiveness at an incomparable depth.  What would you do if faced with the murderer of your child?  You will be astonished and incredibly moved to witness how these remarkable people heal and do the unthinkable.

This is a documentary not to be missed.",1376006400,3,402,4.465753424657534
8323788,5,B00003CXYJ,"Featured on the Documentary Channel, I cannot wait for this to be  released. This may be one of the most moving programs I have ever viewed. If you struggle, as we all do, with finding a sense of justice in this world, then you need to see this. I can remember the news each night detailing the confusing conundrum of SA politics. As a teenager, I could not understand how anyone could watch the news and not wonder what was going on down there. And now, how to undo it all. I cannot imagine what an undertaking this must be. Powerful doesn't begin to descibe what is going on in this documentary. It doesn't matter what interest you have in SA, the only requirement for this is to be a thinking human. All of us need this lesson in forgiveness.",1223337600,7,745,4.321428571428571
8323789,5,B00003CXYJ,"The best of many great South African films. Desmond Tuti, among other leaders, knew South Africa's new government could not just legislate equality after ending aparthied, that punitive measures toward the oppressors would not bring about real change, but that healing was necessary if the country was to have a cohesive, stable future. This film documents the brilliant ""Truth and Reconciliation Process"" which  pardoned all who had committed atrocities during the oppressive regime IF they ""came clean""--in detail--before the families of their victims and  the entire nation. The ""Truth and Reconciliation Process"" was aired live on television and radio stations across S.A.
Phenomenal. I have never heard of a more enlightened government policy. The world should take notes! This documentry is tough to watch and also, inspiring as hell.",1203638400,6,840,5.503875968992248
