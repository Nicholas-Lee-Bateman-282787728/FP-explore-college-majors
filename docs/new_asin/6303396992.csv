8193261,4,6303396992,"Camila is one of my favorite films. It's based on something that actually took place in 19th century Argentina. Camila was the daughter of a wealthy landowner who fell in love with a young priest. She was a very independent woman (many thought too independent for that particular time in Argentina's history). Camila and Kate Hepburn would have understood each other quite well. The acting in Camila is superb, as are the costumes and photography. Imanol Arias, who plays the young priest, is very handsome and I, as a woman, understood why Camila fell for him. The movie deals with the always controversial subject of Priestly Celibacy extremely well.
I highly recommend this movie.",1060905600,2,683,5.0
8193262,4,6303396992,"I absolutely loved this movie.  I was required to watch this movie for a Latin American history class I took.  The best part of the class was my introduction to this movie.  This movie has just about everything in it.  It has romance, true historical events, a little comedy, and its a tearjerker.  The movie is based on the true story of Camila O' Gorman.  Camila was a member of an elite family in Argentina who ran off with a Priest.  This caused quite a stir during this time because women were expected to uphold the honor of the family, and this act was considered dishonorable.  The movie is a gem from Latin America, and I highly recommend it.",1023667200,,651,4.411764705882353
