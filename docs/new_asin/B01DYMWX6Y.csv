8757307,5,B01DYMWX6Y,"Excellent, but made a bit melodramatic with unnecessary and very distracting visual graphics inserted. Sometimes even limiting the powerful information contained in photographs and film footage. Regardless, this is an excellent documentary. The great German musical works are used for musical scoring and to heightening the effect. Though unbelievably they are not identified in the credits. The historical footage is exceptional. Touches on all the big milestones with interpretation and commentary specifically on effects of the German situation, society, struggles, and Hitler, particularly his personal, manufactured, and interpersonal attributes, along with the NS party and culture, on each other, and the general population, and subsequent tragic results. Very well done. Based on Rees book with Kershaw as consultant.",1530144000,,825,6.0

8757312,3,B01DYMWX6Y,"This 176-minute video is very much in the same vein as, and sometimes taken from, ""The Nazis: A Warning from History.""  The focus is on the interaction between the masses and Hitler in creating the peculiar phenomenon of ""Hitler's charisma,"" following the argument of Ian Kershaw in his Hitler biography. The frequent interspersions in color of Bavarian countryside and eerie music, which is also a feature of ""The Nazis,"" seemed even more noticeable and distracting in this production than in ""The Nazis.""  I bought this in the hope that it would be good as an optional, extra-credit film for a small class to illustrate particular aspects of an era, but its didactic tone is not very suitable for that purpose.",1507507200,2,712,4.925
