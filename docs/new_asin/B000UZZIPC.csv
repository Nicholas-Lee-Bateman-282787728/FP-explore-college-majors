8215933,1,B000UZZIPC,I can't even justify giving this DVD one star. I didn't receive it the first time it was mailed and the vendor had to send me another which took two more weeks to receive. 52 minutes into the disc-the head fell off the shoulders of Dr Jack and the transmission stopped. So I presume the disc was faulty. This was way too much trouble for this disc. I found the information extremely condescending and the presentation completely nauseating.,1390176000,,440,4.653846153846154
8215934,5,B000UZZIPC,"I am so very glad that I purchased this wonderfully made DVD from Dr. Jack and Rexella Van Impe! Whenever someone I know would lose a beloved pet, I try to assure them how I strongly believe that when all animals pass away, they very soon afterward open their eyes again in the Kingdom of Heaven, where they will live happy, carefree lives for all eternity....but, although I am thoroughly confident of this, I never did know exactly where to go in Scripture to offer Biblical conformation. Now that I have this well-researched, sensitively and expertly made DVD, I am able to offer verifiable proof concerning this particular subject. What a find!",1356998400,7,648,4.794642857142857
8215935,5,B000UZZIPC,"I agree with the other review on here, Jack and Rexella Van Impe have made a amazing, touching dvd about pet loss and animals in heaven. I recently lost my dog and cat just 2 months apart, the grief can be overwhelming at times. It is very hard to find much information on the subject and it seems few people really understand.  I feel I have lost a family member. This dvd is such a comfort to a broken heart. They share their own experience of pets they have lost with much compassion and humor. I found the video to be very uplifting and comforting. Hearing the bible scriptures that clearly show animals in the afterlife and what 12 other famous Christain theologians taught on the subject was also fascinating. I found myself crying, laughing and enjoying this so much I have watched it several times! Thank you for this video Dr. Jack and Rexella, God Bless you both!! This dvd can also be purchased from the Van Impe web site at a lower cost..

8215936,5,B000UZZIPC,"I love this video.  I can tell that a lot of hard work and research went into the making of Animals in Heaven.  Jack Van Impe gives many scripture passages to back up his belief, along with those of other prominent Biblical scholars like Billy Graham, that there will indeed be animals in heaven.  In no way does this subject take away from the worship of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.  It is very informative and also includes a bit of humor.  I would encourage all animal lovers to get this video and share it with others, particularly those who do not have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.  It is encouraging and uplifting.",1284854400,18,641,4.530434782608696
