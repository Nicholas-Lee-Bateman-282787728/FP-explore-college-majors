3982374,2,B002SVP9IW,"This film is uncompelling and filled with overacting.  Plus, the plot is impossible to follow nor can one discern the motivations of the film's protagonists.  Finally, it needs to be in English.  90%+ was in Japanese.

Don't waste your time.",1275177600,3,241,4.95
3982375,3,B002SVP9IW,"I was highly anticpating this movie.  I have read all of Barry Eisler's books and totally enjoyed the John Rain character.  I was disappointed that this movie was coming out in Japan and not in the US.  Luckily, before I purchased the movie I rented it last night.  Maybe it's because it's a movie made in Japan that I had trouble following the story line.  I had trouble following who was who and I had read the book.  If not for that I don't think I would have had any idea what was happening.  There were two key things I really liked in the book - John Rain liked scotch and jazz.  In this movie he never drank and they only reference jazz because the female lead plays jazz piano.  What's going on?  Rent it don't buy it!!",1274832000,16,727,4.202898550724638

3982387,4,B002SVP9IW,"This is a pretty successful film made from the adventures of spy/martial artist John Rain, half Asian protagonist of a very good series of novels whose titles, like this one, pun on ""Rain."" Although the novels feature more interior monologue, as expected, this film does capture his brooding nature very well.",1402531200,,309,5.078431372549019
3982388,4,B002SVP9IW,"If you've read the book, you'll enjoy any opportunity to see the characters interpreted and brought to life through a movie.",1396828800,,124,4.9523809523809526
3982389,3,B002SVP9IW,"As a reader of the ""Rain"" series i could follow the movie somewhat and knew who the characters where . Not knowing would be hard to follow for average movie goer! Hope they try again",1384041600,,182,4.228571428571429
3982390,4,B002SVP9IW,"I too have read all of Barry Eisler's John Rain books and enjoyed them immensely. This was a a good and faithful adaptation in catching the tone and spirit of the character.

Setting the film in Japan with a largely Japanese cast probably hurt it's commercial appeal as unfortunately few Americans seem to have any patience for foreign films and won't read subtitles. I thought it felt authentic. The restrained, and subtle romantic attachments of the leads was a nice change of pace from what one usually sees.

Rain's conflicted psyche is part of what makes his character so interesting in the books and it is brought out here.",1379894400,,629,4.761467889908257
3982391,4,B002SVP9IW,"Not as captivating as the book, but still invigorating. Choppy, but still held our attention.  We enjoyed how the closing scenes left us wanting to see another installment.",1374883200,,172,5.142857142857143
3982392,3,B002SVP9IW,"First off, the movie took a long time to get to me.  But I contacted the seller and they were nicely responsive.
I was just happy to see John Rain in movie form.  The movie itself could have been better.  It seemend rushed and deviates from the book a lot.  Tatsu is portrayed as a kind of minor, hapless cop character, not the all-seeing mastermind he is in the book.  There is no Harry to be Rain's friend and tech guy.  And the scenes with Gary Oldman watching TV monitors of surveillance seemed like Bourne lite.  I think they watched  too much Bourne and read too little Rain.
The actor who portrayed Rain was fine - he would still make a good John Rain.  They just need to keep writing and working on a screenplay.  I'd like to see Eisler's The Detachment made into a movie.
Too much of the movie was in Japanese with subtitles, also.
So - it's cool to watch it just to see John Rain in movie form.  But it is not what we'd hoped for in a Rain film.",1369699200,,955,4.135869565217392
3982393,5,B002SVP9IW,Great acting and worth the price.  Of course Gary Oldman is such a great actor. I like this one. Glad I purchased it.,1366848000,,117,4.086956521739131
3982394,1,B002SVP9IW,"...this movie was TERRIBLE.

Cinematography was tremendous, but that was about it.  The script and directing was horrifically embarrasing and poorly executed.

They got Gary Oldman and felt like they need to expand his role and let him go way over the top with it. A lot of screaming.

It's not even a story about him.",1363392000,,318,4.625
3982395,3,B002SVP9IW,"Unfortunately they didn't follow the ""heart of the book""  the series is excellent, but the movie came up short. I understand the subtitles, but it did make it harder to follow.  Would have like to see the true characters come out on the big screen",1359072000,,247,4.466666666666667
3982406,1,B002SVP9IW,"The fact that this was straight to video should have been enough of a sign.  I like others thought I would give
this a watch due to having read the series.  I sure hope that Eisler didn't write the screenplay and if he did that he was paid enough so that he can create a fund to reimburse those of us that purchased or rented this movie.

Some salient factors:

1.) I generally don't mind subtitles.  However, this was not billed as a foreign film?  The majority of the dialogue is in Japanese with English subtitles, except for when Gary Oldman rants in American accent or the John Rain character speaks acceted English (was he not born and raised in the US?)

2.) For all the points made by other review, the movie storyline did no service to written series.  The Bourne series is proof that both the books and movies can be entertaining

Far be it from me to cast asperions on how anyone makes a living, however, Gary Oldman must have needed a check!",1294531200,2,953,4.369318181818182
3982407,3,B002SVP9IW,"The story is centered about Rain, and North American of Japanese origin, ex-member of the Special forces of the USA Army, who actually works for himself as mercenary. Once he has got a task related with a very valuable disk , searched by many organizations, will be forced to protect the daughter of his won victim.

Uneven adaptation of the famous bestseller of Barry Eisler.",1290643200,,376,4.7846153846153845
3982408,1,B002SVP9IW,"The director must have read a book not published yet in the Rain series. It is the story of John Rain's little brother. Rain Junior obviously does not work out, does not know judo, in fact he knows quite little about fighting, mostly he throws bad punches. Rain Junior also has a very sappy side, and seems to enjoy teen-age flirts and kittens. Rain Junior does not drink, let alone a good single malt. Rain Junior lives in a Tokyo which appears much less exciting than it is in reality, and where CIA and Yakuza mix in such a loose plot that it is impossible to stay entertained. If you like the John Rain books, do not spoil your mental images with this movie.",1288396800,2,662,4.346774193548387
3982409,1,B002SVP9IW,"I knew this movie was in trouble when:
(a.) I see a professional assassin pointing a gun with the intent of shooting someone from a reasonable 10 foot distance walk up to within arm's length of the victim - first dumb.  The result is having the victim move their entire arm 3 feet faster than the professional assassin can move their finger 2 mm and he loses the gun - second dumb. Then he loses his life - third dumb.
(b.) The CIA covert operation looks like a midday luncheon with a couple of staff in a secretary's office - fourth dumb.
(c.) A dozen cheap flat screen TVs meant to represent CCTV camera coverage of all of Tokyo and a part of Japan. I haven't checked recently but aren't there quite a few people in Tokyo? And, aren't there a couple of spots where cameras aren't located? Let's see, my math skills suggest that at least a million cameras would be needed to cover what was indicated in the movie and imagine following all that on twelve screens not only in real time but also in viewing archived video - five+ million dumbs.
(d.) The main coverup plot in this movie was that the Americans are trying to figure out how to lift importing restrictions so they can sell more of their cars and rice to Japan. Give me a break Japan doesn't need poorly made cars and contaminated rice. Besides I would think they would be more concerned about truly competitive imports from Korea and China and the rest of the Far East - more dumb.
(e.) If the CIA is as loud, obnoxious, mistake prone and out of control as was represented by Oldman then the CIA is truly as dumb as many people believe they are - in fact they're (100,000+ textbook memorizing, B.A. diploma on a cubicle, white collar desk sitters) dumb dumb.",1281225600,4,1719,4.40566037735849
3982410,2,B002SVP9IW,I too was taken in by Gary Oldman being in the picture.  The photograpy was unforgiveably dark and annoying to me. Something was lost in translation because  I found the story line hard to follow and turned it off after about half an hour.,1280275200,,239,4.409090909090909
3982411,4,B002SVP9IW,I absolutely love this movie. Thank you for providing it at such a great price.,1279584000,,79,4.333333333333333
3982412,1,B002SVP9IW,"This is a warning of not buying or even seeing the movie. If there is a minus star I would have given it. The movie has about 5 % of the book. Lousy acting, lousy story, lousy romance. The Rain character can barely speak English! Tatsu look like a homeless person. So disappointed.",1278547200,5,281,4.320754716981132
3982413,4,B002SVP9IW,"Having just seen Rain Fall, not having read the book, I can easily see the movie is more skillfully put together, as well as acted, than many other films of the genre, especially those made in Asia. Certainly not markedly less interesting or entertaining than the Ridley Scott directed ""Black Rain"", which featured Micheal Douglas and Andy Garcia at the height of their careers, as well as two excellent leading actors from Japan, and averaged four stars in reviews here. Worth checking out.",1277942400,3,491,4.927710843373494
3982414,1,B002SVP9IW,"This is a Japanese movie with American subtitles. Gary Oldman is inserted to fool the U. S. audience into renting/buying it, and he then proceeds to reward his few remaining fans by shrieking, bellowing, and generally overacting to an embarrassing degree. The plot is incomprehensible, the dialog utterly pointless and boring, the action scenes (probably the only part that could have been entertaining) are poorly choreographed, and the acting is universally stiff and awful. On the bright side, the photography is well done, but who cares, when nothing photographed is worth watching. I dozed off repeatedly during the viewing ordeal, and was rudely awakened by the explosively loud noises accompanying most scene changes, no doubt inserted by the director/editor for this exact purpose. I have no idea how it all ended, since I stopped my suffering after about 90 minutes, hit the ""eject"" button, and wrote this review as a warning to others: Do not waste your time or money on this awful movie. One star is too generous. It is unwatchable.",1277596800,28,1043,5.069767441860465
3982415,1,B002SVP9IW,Barry Eisler's book was great.  All of his John Rain books are terrific.  This movie was really bad.  Very disappointing.,1277164800,16,121,4.95
8379671,5,B002SVP9IW,I love this movie! watched many times,1515369600,,37,4.428571428571429
8379672,5,B002SVP9IW,This is a great adaptation of a great novel.  I love that it was a Japanese movie with all the nuances of the Japanese. (Watch Godzilla without Raymond Burr to see what I mean.)  Kippei Shiina was perfect as John Rain.,1502409600,,218,4.2926829268292686

8379675,1,B002SVP9IW,"This is a badly directed and produced movie. It is indulgent and misses the special story Barry Eisler wrote. Kippei Shina and the other Japanese actors are fine. But Gary Oldman gives a screechy, over the top performance. He reminds me of David Strathairn's yelling at everybody trying to capture Jason Bourne. The story is completely muddled, and plotting is similarly confused. The important characters are people who appear but really add nothing of substance. The most important character in Eisler's spectacular John Rain books is not only Rain himself but the city of Tokyo itself, as well as the Japanese people and their wonderful qualities. I think Eisler himself should have written the script instead of director Mannix, a hack if there ever was one. When I saw the list of financial backers, the input of Japanese money into making this misstep was apparent. But, like buying major Hollywood studios as the Japanese like to do, what their money buys doesn't buy them love or success. To be avoided.",1460419200,4,1011,4.952941176470588
8379676,4,B002SVP9IW,"Still reading it, seen the movie, really good.",1453852800,,46,4.875
8379677,1,B002SVP9IW,"After having listened to all of Barry Eislers' books on audio, I was really looking forward to watching this movie. If you haven't read the books, skip this movie and go straight for the books, you will not be disappointed...the books are 5 star all the way.

This film was very hard to follow I was constantly trying to figure out how the story got from one place to the next. The acting was, okay, the screenplay was terrible and the suspense that can be found in the books, was completely lost. I couldn't tell what was going on or why throughout the entire thing and, I've listened to the audio book, all of 'em in fact. The ending of the movie, which I can only assume was supposed to create a ""cliff hanger like anticipation"" for the next film in the series simply falls flat.

I will never understand why the movie industry wastes money turning excellent stories into really bad films. I get it, there is no way that Hollywood can compete with what goes on in a persons' mind when they read a really, really good book. And we know that they ""understand"" how to make good movies: the Hobbit, Harry Potter and Jason Bourne series, are all examples of great books turned into excellent movies. I'm a consumer and not a ""movie maker,"" with that being said, I simply refuse to believe that in this case they couldn't have turned out a great movie instead of...well, this disaster.

I hope that this bad product doesn't deter Mr. Eisler from pursuing the movie angle in the future, just with the right people on the job.

With that being said, my review of this movie is not intended to reflect poorly on the author or the books he has written. I am a huge fan of his works, the John Rain and Ben Treven series as well as his short stories and unlike the ending of this movie, I am patiently awaiting the release of his next book which I think comes out next January.

If you like political, spy thriller type  movies, skip this one and get the book.",1444780800,4,1951,4.375690607734807
8379678,2,B002SVP9IW,"This is a miss and another reason why well written books struggle on the screen. The change in era makes for a significant problem and prevents the viewer from seeing Rain's connection to the inspector, his attraction to a young Jazz pianist and his third culture existence. Rain in the book is much more sophisticated, better educated and more connected with Tokyo. The result is a move that is disconnected, forced and rather than exposing the viewer to the beauty and intrigue of Japanese culture, it becomes a dark and unrealistic. If you read the book, skip the movie. I you have yet to read the book, get it and skip the movie.",1438905600,3,633,4.610619469026549
8379679,5,B002SVP9IW,Very good,1435708800,,9,4.0
8379680,1,B002SVP9IW,"This may well be the absolutely worse movie adaptation of any book. Ever. And what adds insult to injury is that the book this let's-call-it-a-movie was based upon was a great action-packed, well thought out covert-assassin/martial arts novel. I can only imagine the agony of Barry Eisler when he first sat through this!

Absolutely nothing works. The plot has gaping holes one could drive a bullet-train through. The main cast is barely adequate whereas the supporting cast is absolutely amateurish - including Gary Oldman who phoned in yet another over the top lips pouting and spit-shouting that he tries for years to pass as ""acting"". I have seen middle-school students giving better performances than these. The camera work is often unflattering and almost always obscuring; the writing was utterly uninformed (would it kill them to read a CIA agent manual beforehand?), the dialogue wooden and the story progression generally intolerable.

It starts off as a disjointed action film only to end up as a sappy Bollywood love-story. The only thing missing is the happy dance at the end with everyone, dead or alive, joining their voices to sing the praises to John Rain.

A movie so bad one cannot even laugh at it.",1421452800,,1218,4.990147783251231
