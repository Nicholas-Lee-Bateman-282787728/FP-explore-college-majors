8193171,1,B000BZ8IGW,$75 for that?..best buy $60 for the whole series..yeah ur way over priced,1409788800,,73,4.6923076923076925
8193172,5,B000BZ8IGW,This boxset I like because it continues the Baby story on the planet Tuffle/Vegeta and the story of Super Android 17 with all of the previous bad guys. I think Raditz should have met Goku for a bit of sibling rivalry as they are brothers. I still cry when Piccolo chooses to die at the end. The storylines are similiar to that of DBZ.,1216166400,,334,4.234375
8193173,4,B000BZ8IGW,"Excellent! Not Dragonball z, but pretty damn good for a show which had almost nothing to do with the creator of dragon ball besides the character designs.",1197849600,,154,4.7407407407407405
8193174,4,B000BZ8IGW,"This a pretty ok end to the series,its not as bad as people say. It might have some slow moments but it gets knocked harder than it should. I would advise new dragonball fans to not start with this. Start with dragonball its a good start to everything. You can get the individual dvds very cheap on amazon. I give it 4 stars because the fights don't have that fast action fighting like the the rest of the series,the charecters are weaker except for goku,and also vegeta at the end,and the fights aren't as climactic as in the rest of the series. It could have had more movies though,but as a big db and dbz fan I have to like dbgt. I recommend buying this part of db series after you watch dragonball and dragonballz.",1184803200,,718,4.325925925925926
8193175,4,B000BZ8IGW,the product is nice it just took awhile to get. well besides that it was nice and good condtion.,1174780800,,96,4.105263157894737
8193176,1,B000BZ8IGW,"story sucks, action sucks, SSJ 4 looks weird, it made me so disappointed watching GT that Akira Toriyama didn't make a good sequel to DBZ. Well, too late.",1153785600,4,154,4.535714285714286
8193177,3,B000BZ8IGW,"Well to start... the box looks pretty...  Anyway, Son Goku continues his fight with Bebi on the remade Truffle planet.  Soon enough, Toei decides to give Goku a really annoying line, ""The only thing that can beat Bebi is me, a Super Saiyajin 4."" or something along those lines.  Plain and simple, Toei Animation believes only Goku can do everything.  Afterward, 17 has been revived even though he never really died to begin with except for that time he spent as Imperfect Cell...  Which is another was of seeing, Toei Animation is making Goku a god.  Everyone is owned by Super 17 except Kid Goku.  Also, their were a lot of plotholes.  Trunks knows who 17 is when 17 was already a wanderer by the time this Trunks was born.

Toei Animation bashing aside, it's time to get to dub criticism.  Mark Menza's GT Rap is still used in the beginning, it is just terrible.  No offense dude, but it just, no...  The peaceful background music that once was is still ignored.  FUNImation also refuses to say Hell.  After everything they've dubbed, they still can't have Dragon Ball characters go to Hell.  It is probably because this is FUNImation's only property to be played in the afternoon and night time hours amd it is their only property that children know of.

Alright, bashing aside it's time to go to good things.  The quality of the footage is pretty good, nice and clean unlike FUNImations 'Ultimate uncuts' and Dragon Ball box sets.  So that's nice, they didn't put too muc footage so the picture quality is intact and they didn't screw with the colors and call it digitally revised.

These episodes also feature quite a lot of action.  It may be the thing that really kills Dragon Ball and all that it is, but it seems a lot of people like spiky haired guys kicking each others butts.

And as always, have to give props to good subtitles, Steven J. Simmons baby!  Man!  That guy just makes any FUNImation property, in success or blunder, terrific.",1140220800,4,1950,4.604651162790698
