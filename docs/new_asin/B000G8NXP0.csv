I used to love how the disintegrator guns turned people instantly into skeletons. The acting is wooden and the Gargon monster is ridiculous but the plot isn't bad for a 50s sci-fi film with a $12 budget.
The best film of the bunch is Teenage Doll, which is not a genre film but a 1950s juvenile delinquent drama from Roger Corman.
Teenage Monster is no bad no one should have to see it.",1468713600,,539,4.142857142857143

8129402,3,B000G8NXP0,"Before I start getting bashed for giving this set 3 stars, I would like to point out that I love old sci-fi and horror films. I also love the really cheaply made goofy ones. The three films in this set however are really bad on just about every level. Don't get me wrong there is plenty to chuckle at here, but for the most part the films are painfully boring and would make prime candidates for the MST3K crew, RiffTrax or Cinema Titanic if they haven't been done already.

The DVD set on the other hand is very nice, you get 3 DVD's, each film gets their own disc and none of the discs are stacked on top of one another (Hello Disney..and every other major company stacking their discs now!). The prints are really nice, some minor scratches here and there, but they're nice clear images with excellent sound. If you like these types of films or have been wanting these films in particular, then this set is a bargain.

One other thing I would like to point out is the title is a little misleading as only 2 of the films are sci-fi/horror films (I use the term loosely) they would be Teenagers from Outer Space and Teenage Monster(my personal favorite here) the third film Teen Doll is an early Roger Corman film about street hoods. It's no big deal, but with a title like Teen Terror, I expected horror/sci-fi films although terror as in terrible is certainly applicable here.",1392854400,10,1379,4.468253968253968

8129405,4,B000G8NXP0,"Great collection of late 50's scifi/monster movies.  If you like the grade juvenile delinquent 50's schlock, you'll love this.  Recommended.",1355011200,2,140,5.95
