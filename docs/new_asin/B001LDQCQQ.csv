8317816,5,B001LDQCQQ,"When a woman has a new baby, it almost goes without saying that she will join some form of a mothers' group where both the practical and emotional aspects of parenting will be discussed. For fathers, however, no such tradition exists and while more is expected of fathers than ever before in history, the role models for this kind of involvement are nowhere to be found. In Bruce Lintons', Becoming A Father, a voice is finally given to contemporary fatherhood. We are given a first hand glimpse into some of the struggles, dreams, hopes and confusion, that new fathers may face. Dr. Linton helps the men in his groups examine how their relationship with their own dads may impact their expectations around parenting, the value of taking time to consciously  consider the choices one makes as a parent, and the shear enormity of the job of parenting. This film is a much needed documentation of the ""real"" experience of fatherhood, and will be of great value to new and expecting fathers as well as their partners.",1238025600,,1014,4.761363636363637
8317817,5,B001LDQCQQ,"This documentary explores the personal stories of a number of men who began coming to the Father's Forum ([...]) when their children were babies.  They gather again, years later, when some of their children are going off to college.

I enjoyed this film, not only for the glimpse into these personal journeys, but also as an exploration of a variety of factors that effect fathers, including cultural expectations, family histories, and community support.  The most poignant feature is how the experience of fathering, through all of it's challenges, was influenced by the support of other men.

Dr. Linton states that his goal is to raise the value our culture places on fathering. His work and film are admirable contributions.",1237852800,,729,5.100840336134453
8317818,5,B001LDQCQQ,"Becoming a Father is a wonderful resource providing viewers a glimpse into the value of having a forum to explore and enrich the experience of fatherhood.  For many years, Bruce Linton's Father's Forum groups have  provided an important space for father's to explore together their experience as parents.  Becoming a Father, featuring fathers from his groups,  brings to light how missing this space can be for men and how rich an experience it is to learn from others and share one's hopes and fears about being a father.

As a provider of new mother's groups, I am so often made aware of our culture's focus on the role of mothers with very little support for the role of fathers.  This film brings into focus the crucial role of fathers and the changing values men experience as they become parents.",1237161600,,802,4.733812949640288
8317819,4,B001LDQCQQ,"Bruce Linton has produced a moving and warm documentary on fatherhood, as seen through the eyes of current and former members of Bruce's Father's Forum groups. The viewer gains a deeper understanding of how fatherhood can reshape and refocus what it means to be a man and the vital role father's play in the lives of their children. As a current member of one of Bruce's Father's Forum groups (though I have no role in this film), I continue to find the role of our group to be a valuable way to connect with other dads. This film is a welcome addition and excellent resource-where very few exist-to assist fathers.",1233792000,,615,4.6
