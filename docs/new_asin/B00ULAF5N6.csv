8707308,2,B00ULAF5N6,"This was a mistake, in the making and in the purchasing.  It's almost painful to watch for two reasons: Chris has considerable trouble hitting the high notes for which he became famous in his youth and, more importantly, the overall sound quality of the DVD is just horrendous.  It was an outdoor concert, recorded unprofessionally, and while the video is passable, the sound quality of almost every song is just plain awful.  I wish Chris had allowed an indoor concert at the peak of his and Soundgarden's careers to be captured for posterity the right way.  But as far as I can tell, he didn't.  And this is a very poor second choice for Soundgarden fans looking to relive one of the band's concerts on DVD.",1517529600,3,709,4.595238095238095
