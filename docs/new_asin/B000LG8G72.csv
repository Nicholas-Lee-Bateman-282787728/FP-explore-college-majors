8161921,1,B000LG8G72,"I planned an R&R in Morocco, which is why I sent for the DVD. I received it in record time but found it to be defective. It operated for about five minutes before getting hung up. After trouble shooting the DVD and equipment, I had a friend try it on his player and again nothing. I believe I'm going to stay with the Globetrekker brand. I've never had a problem with Globetrekker. I would like to send the DVD back but I'm in a remote part of the middle east and it would be more trouble than it's worth. Especially after reading the return policy.

I still feel it is a small price to pay before investing your time and money in hopefully a life long memory. Thank you.",1180656000,,671,4.2015503875969
8161922,1,B000LG8G72,"The first 10 minutes or so of this video were interesting, until it froze and wouldn't go any farther.  I looked at the DVD and it's burned, not stamped!!  Is this a bootleg or what?  Amazon will replace it, so hopefully I'll get a legal copy this time.",1171065600,,253,4.229166666666667
