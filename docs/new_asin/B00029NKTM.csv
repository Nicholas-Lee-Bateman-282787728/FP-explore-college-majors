8024426,3,B00029NKTM,"The best thing about this DVD is that it shows how demanding being on tour is, and how much crap you have to put up with. It also shows how difficult the job of being someone's personal assistant is. So, this DVD was informative.
The downside for me was how crude Gina Gershon is.  I mean how many times does she have to flip off the camera.  Is she 46 or 16?!  She is incredibly hot, but I was disappointed that she had to be so crude. She and Lenny Kravitz butchered Joan Jett's ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"". It was shameful.  Though, I am not sure that Lenny was the problem. Gina sings slow melodies great, but is not a rock & roller.
Gina Gershon got screwed by the distributor! Her distributor didn't even send out copies of the soundtrack, and didn't send out copies of the movies to be screened.  She did countless interviews and no one had seen the movie or heard the CD. She has every right to be mad about that.  It's as if they never cared about the film, even though they agreed to be a part of the project.
Again, this DVD was very informative and mildly entertaining.",1234656000,2,1075,4.219512195121951
8024427,2,B00029NKTM,"I love Gina Gershon as much as the next guy or gal, but this was soooooo boring. I think she is a beautiful and charismatic performer, but the behind the scenes material here is like watching someone's home movies...sooo boring. I wanted more of Lovedog's music,less of the band ,her assistant,guitar tech, road manager and yes..... less Gina. A straight concert performance would have been much more satisfying.",1191456000,,412,5.073529411764706

Women take the tools, the reason.

It is for baby child the education.

Thanks Gina, the show.",1135728000,,112,4.7894736842105265
8024429,5,B00029NKTM,"Look, I WAS NOT a Gina Gershon fan.  I hardly knew who she was.  I kind of watched this series on IFC just to see how bad it sucked.  BUT it didn't suck.  It rocked.  Gina is a great singer, her band is great, she's super cool and super sexy.

After watching this, I found that I AM now a big Gina fan.  Actually, I wish she'd come back on a another music tour, as I would go see her for sure.

She may be a B-movie actress, but she's an A rock star, especially given all the untalented ""star"" women in pop and rock.

Go Gina! Keep up the good work!",1100044800,13,549,3.830357142857143
8024430,4,B00029NKTM,"Okay I've been a huge Gina Gershon fan for years (despite some stinkers like Showgirls) so when I saw this in the video store I had to pick it up. I had seen Prey for Rock and Roll, and was underwhelmed. I was however impressed with Gina's singing. Not for most people, but she was brave to go on tour after only being with the band for two weeks. The six episodes take us inside Gina's life as she prepares for her shows. From the first episode I was hooked. Gina has the kind of personality that you just can't help but love. She is not a pretentious Hollywood actress in anyway. She ""keeps it real."" Often humorous, as when we get a glimpse of her fans...who are very interesting to say the least. Gina really put her heart and soul into this movie but there are many setbacks. She doesn't let that stop her from having fun and singing her ass off. We meet some of her friends along the way (Lenny Kravitz,Chris Rock, etc.)and also get to know her band. Especially funny is the episode in San Francisco, where we see why one member of her band calls her LL Cool G (Lesbians Love Cool Gina). So check it out...you won't be disappointed...esp. if you love Ms. Gershon.",1092009600,10,1169,4.318181818181818
8024431,5,B00029NKTM,"I had the pleasure of watching all six episodes when they originally aired on IFC. It's a rare and enjoyable glimpse at Gina Gershon's real personality, and it will certainly keep you glued to your television. For an actress who is often cast in such dramatic roles, Gershon has wonderful comedic instinct. It shows the ups and downs of being on the road and trying to promote an independent film.

 I've heard a lot of negative comments regarding the music and her singing. Keep in mind that most of the songs are from the movie Prey for Rock & Roll and were written by Cheri Lovedog. Sure, Gershon isn't the best singer in the world, but she's no worse than half the ""professionals"" there are stuck at the top of the pop charts at any given moment. Bottom line, Gershon is intelligent, sexy, and funnier than you could have ever imagined...you won't be disappointed with this dvd.",1091318400,12,882,4.611464968152866
8024432,1,B00029NKTM,"Well, how do I say it...this one is really pretty bad. It is vapid and the equivalence of watching the Anna Nicole Smith Show (though Gershon is significantly easier on the eyes) and Beverly Hills 91210. Yes it's that painful.

 The concept sounded intriguing enough...makeshift band hits the road with sensual type actress playing stripped down edgy music. Gershon sets herself up by stating up front actresses turned rockers rarely comes out well and good. And thus we are announced of the train wreck coming long before you hear the rumble with ear close to the rail. That in and of itself doesn't sink the show...it's the same appeal that draws people in to the Anna Nicole show...the drama of an impending train wreck. What does sink the show is the lack of the proceedings to reach any level of significance or interest. It's plain dull. Even the San Francisco episode in which Gershon has a large female alternative lifestyle crowd due to her acting in a movie called ""Bound"" comes across simply as exploited, tawdry, and surfaced.

 I want back the time I spent feeling like I needed to watch this DVD due to the rental price at Hollywood. Unless you are one of the crowd featured in the footage or like surface material trying way too hard to come off as hip cool and edgy rock...steer clear dear friends.
