6094671,5,B00GOC74PC,"I bought this DVD recently at a big box store for just $5.  Mill Creek has recently put out this new DVD set for Dilbert  (they also put out a Married with Children set) and they are able to keep the prices low because there are no extras to speak of.  All the episodes are complete and present, there is just no special features.  But at just $5 for the complete series of one of the best shows ever, you can't beat that!",1393372800,21,422,4.048192771084337

6094685,4,B00GOC74PC,"Soft. It seems to insulate well. It does not block all light so if you need blackout, get a retractable shade too. That's the only downside.",1478908800,,140,4.423076923076923

6094690,2,B00GOC74PC,"How long did you read Dilbert? Have you been reading and re-reading Dilbert comics? If not, then this may be a great series to borrow from a friend rather than pick up. If you do grab it, be sure to share it.

This show was fun, but the rewatchability seems to be fairly low.",1473897600,,275,4.092592592592593

6094697,5,B00GOC74PC,Too bad they canceled this. Scott Adams's humor is a little too subtle for some people to understand. It is dead on and exquisitely vicious.,1464480000,,140,4.64
6094698,5,B00GOC74PC,Loved. this show in the past and love it now...esp for the 4.75 dollars and 'free' prime shipping!  So glad to find such a great show so inexpensive.,1462924800,,149,4.321428571428571
6094699,1,B00GOC74PC,"Mill Creek botches another release. Surprise, surprise.

Dilbert is one of the funniest and most underrated TV series of the past 20 years.

In 2004, Sony put out a Complete Series set loaded to the gills with special features. That release is unfortunately now out of print, however, it can be had for very cheap.

This re-issue Mill Creek has put out condenses the series down from 4 to 3 discs (resulting in higher artifacting and compression) along with stripping all of the bonus features.

Yeah, it's cheap, but you get what you pay for.

Seek out the original release if you want to enjoy this show the way it was meant to be.",1462147200,14,633,4.517543859649122
6094700,5,B00GOC74PC,LOVE THIS!!! this is very hard to find new.,1462147200,,43,3.888888888888889
6094701,5,B00GOC74PC,If you like the Dilbert comics that this will probably entertain you for a bit!  Odd to put a 'voice' to Dilbert.  Probably good to watch twice at most.,1461888000,,152,4.206896551724138

6094704,5,B00GOC74PC,Dilbert is one of my all-time favourite series. My only regret is that it was not aired for more seasons.,1458432000,,105,4.3
6094705,2,B00GOC74PC,"Physical product: 4/5 stars.  The production value for the price is great.  The discs contain nothing but the episodes, so if you don't care about bonuses, this is the cheaper choice.  I take away a star for two reasons, one minor and one major.  Minor: the discs are stacked on top of each other in the case, making it more challenging to pick your disc and increasing the chance of scratches.  Major: the episodes are out of order!  It doesn't matter too much in later episodes, since they are mostly just one-off stories, but near the beginning in which there is a serial story, it can lead to confusion.

Content: 0/5 stars.  This show is incredibly unfunny.  The jokes frequently are poorly delivered with bad timing and no humor.  It's like a stand-up comedian whose material isn't that good, and after delivering a flat joke, mugs on the stage, saying, ""Eh?  Eh?""

Average score: 2/5",1457654400,,890,4.670967741935484
6094706,5,B00GOC74PC,This series should have been thrice as long.  Best show that exposes the hypocracies of any government or corporate system,1457568000,,122,5.1

They, however, are in a single case and placed one on top of the other with no protection between DVDs.",1450656000,3,119,4.173913043478261
6094717,5,B00GOC74PC,Good stuff,1447977600,,10,4.5
6094718,4,B00GOC74PC,"I ordered this as it was recommended to me through amazon. I remember being in high school was on and catching one show. The set is bare bones and very cost friendly. I would highly recommend this set for anyone who enjoys cartoons for older audiences. It has great writing and some very loveable characters. For $6, it's a very sweet deal. Picture quality is sharp and the colors really pop.",1443052800,,392,4.535211267605634
6094719,5,B00GOC74PC,"If you like the Dilbert Comics or just love to hate work, this is the series for you. Unfortunately, it was short lived, but I strongly think the Dilbert series is a hidden gem. The series is well written, funny, and insightful. You'll find yourself laughing, but also relating to the characters well. When you can understand and empathize with characters, it is so much more powerful and enjoyable",1427760000,4,398,4.782608695652174

6094725,5,B00GOC74PC,"Where else can you get the entire series of this beloved (well I love it anyways lol) series for so little money. Only thing it doesn't have is a ton of extras, but that isn't such a big deal as I never cared much for extras on any DVD or BD except for the occasional music video hat was good.",1398643200,6,293,3.9
6094726,1,B00GOC74PC,"I use to like this show, upon revisiting it however, I couldn't even finish it, I got bored really quick and just found this show to be completely dissatisfying compared to when I had first seen it.

8625350,2,B00GOC74PC,"It's not the content that I dislike. I love this series. That's why I bought it.

The problem is the quality of the video. Every frame looks like it was captured from VHS and compressed with JPEG. Also, the interlacing is horrible.",1507248000,,231,4.5
