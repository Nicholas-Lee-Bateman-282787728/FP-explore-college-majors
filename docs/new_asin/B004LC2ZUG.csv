4401133,5,B004LC2ZUG,"I recommend this series.  The story is especially blessed to have Lee Min-Ho as the lead.  He always gives a very honest, innocent portrayal, which enhanses the drama.  The actors make this drama enjoyable, the story showcases their talents, but it is a pleasure for us.",1339200000,2,270,4.826086956521739
4401134,5,B004LC2ZUG,I LOVED THIS MOVIE. I AM 75 YEARS OLD AND AM MADELY IN LOVE WITH LEE-MIN-HO. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS MOVIE,1338595200,29,106,4.095238095238095
4401135,5,B004LC2ZUG,"I watched this show online at Drama Fever and really enjoyed it. I know you can easily watch any country's DVDs on a region-free player, but I wish there was a region 1 DVD release for this series. We Americans enjoy our Kdramas too, y'know?

While this show's premise sounds quirky, it also has depth and emotional substance. In spite of many clichd scenes -- piggyback rides, couple contests, falling down while ice-skating, etc. -- ""Personal Taste"" kept me interested because of the characters. The friendship between the two leads develops slowly, and I think it makes their relationship that much stronger when they inevitably face rough patches. The series gets off to kind of a slow start, and then really picks up momentum after maybe 2 or 3 episodes. Then it suddenly feels ""off"" in the last couple of episodes leading up to the finale (which, by the way, felt rushed and too easily resolved). In spite of these shortcomings, I found the show to be very heartfelt, funny, sad and just plain entertaining.

The two best friends/sidekicks, played by Jo Eun Ji and Jung Sung Hwa, provide many enjoyable, fun scenes. Standout performance, however, by Ryu Seung Ryong as Director Choi. His quiet portrayal of a lonely man is understated and dignified. Son Ye Jin proves she's a talented actress who's able to act silly at times, yet also portray a woman whose struggle with finding self-worth has caused her a lot of heartache. Her character Gae In grows so much throughout the series, thanks to Jin Ho, played by the ever-so-handsome Lee Min Ho. ""Personal Taste"" has allowed him to show that he's more than a pretty face. He was really good as Gu Jun Pyo in ""Boys Over Flowers"", but his performance in this show is better, in my opinion. I felt his talent really shone in the moments when he had no dialogue -- his facial expressions, especially his eyes, conveyed so much that words probably couldn't express. He and Son Ye Jin have great chemistry. I would love to see these two work together again.",1331683200,12,2006,4.712250712250713
4401136,4,B004LC2ZUG,"Note: This review is for the show and not this specific DVD set

How could I not watch this after being totally dazzled by Lee Min Ho in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boys-Over-Flowers-Korean-Drama-Complete-Set-8-DVDs-with-English-Subtitles/dp/B002D11UIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boys Over Flowers - Korean Drama Complete Set (8 DVDs with English Subtitles)</a>?

I was afraid at first of not being able to see him as any other character but Jun Pyo, however watching him portray Jin Ho in this my fears were erased. It doesn't hurt that both characters have very different styles. (Clothes are almost always a good reason to watch any of these Korean dramas.) Jin Ho is very cool and modern, this fits his personality as he is very driven and focused entirely on his work as an up and coming architect.

By contrast Kae In is a complete slob. She's obviously very sweet and trusting, but a bit of a disasterpiece when it comes to life.  If nothing else this drama is worth watching for the dramatic use of power tools. Kae In may be meek and mild but she knows how to wield a chain saw which results in my absolutely favorite scene from this whole drama.

The plot really starts to roll after Kae In has found out in the worst way possible that her long term boyfriend is no longer interested in her: she goes to her roommate/best friend's wedding only to find out he is the groom. Ouch. Money is tight for Kae In, so she advertises for a roommate. Jin Ho has found out that the house Kae In lives in is key to winning the bid in his latest architectural project. And so he moves in, inadvertently giving the impression that he is gay (thus making it ok for her to have a single man living under the same roof as her).  It is pretty sweet how they develop a codependent friendship.  That is what really drives the romance for these two, their genuine friendship.

There is a pretty full cast of secondary characters, some are far more endearing than others. There are two real scene stealers though, Do Bin, the benevolent Art Director who is in charge of the project that Jin Ho is working on.  He acts as a sort of father to Kae In once he gets to know her too, better than her own emotionally iced over father.  He has his own emotionally devastating secret that just makes him that much sadder to watch. He seriously goes around the show looking like a kicked puppy. Sang Joon is the other character who just sizzles in every scene he is in, he is entirely a comedic foil for the cool Jin Ho, but he just does wonders at pretending to be the gay boyfriend.

This show is well worth watching for Lee Min Ho, for awesome powertools and some great secondary characters. I am not as in love with it as other shows and with time I have forgotten parts, it isn't ground breaking, but I really enjoyed it and feel no shame in admitting that I watched it. It is a solid show but it doesn't have me giddy with love for it, I haven't gone back and rewatched parts of it the way I have for other shows.",1325030400,32,3043,4.575367647058823
4401137,5,B004LC2ZUG,"It was adorable, romantic and dramatic. It's about a girl who is too nice, does everything for others and can't stand up for herself and a guy who is super neat and professional and teaches her how to live :)",1324080000,18,208,4.225

4401139,5,B004LC2ZUG,"This is a SUPER funny and endearing comedic love story. It's about this girl who is a furniture designer in her late twenties that makes furniture for single people (which I think is pretty cool). But it is her father's house that gets the attention of architects for an art gallery construction. There are some misunderstandings (truly funny) about Lee Min-Ho's character and turns out they think he is gay. This gives him a chance to ""sneak"" into the house and survey the structure for ideas for his project, but after spending time with the daughter love slowly creeps up. Soon there are many heart wrenching scenes and you find yourself fighting for their love. The subs are ok. There are some grammatical errors in the later half of the series, but nothing too major. It gets the point across about what is being talked about.",1451433600,,831,4.698630136986301
4401140,5,B004LC2ZUG,This review is for the mini series soap and not the dvd---however---oh how I loved it on dramafever !!! It was wonderful---oh so satisfying---and Lee Min Ho was utterly beautiful looking.  I watched the entire series on my ipad and if I could have seen it on dvd format it would have been heaven.  Dramafever is now an app available on amazon fire stick and I was able to get a good picture on my tv set in more recent times.  I absolutely became totally absorbed into the series and it was as if it was really a part of my life --- I was that immersed in the storyline---once you start watching these Korean Soaps--you become really addicted.  Well---suffice to say---buy it !!!,1448496000,,679,4.451612903225806

4401150,1,B004LC2ZUG,"i fist viewed this series on the Internet and enjoyed it very much. So I looked for it on Amazon and purchased it from Asian MediaMarket. I was surprised at the very terrible English subtitles and could not enjoy the storyline or the actors. It is obvious that the subtitles for this particular DVD was done by someone who did not know the English language because the translation, grammar and the tenses did not make any sense whatsoever. I could not find return instructions for this DVD set, as there are on all other orders, which makes me feel like I've been scammed...",1434153600,,574,4.58252427184466

I looked on the product reviews before purchasing and it said that the english translation was good, and so I bought it.  It was not good.  You have to figure it out on your own what they are saying. No problem if you speak Korean.  The grammer was wrong. Using past tense for present words etc.....  I'm guessing that the reason is because it's someone that is chinese translating from Korean and then into English.  Words lost in translation. Movie was good, translation not so good.",1430179200,2,551,4.628865979381444

4401155,5,B004LC2ZUG,"My first and favorite Korean drama I've seen to date! This is the k drama that got me addicted to all others! I just love how the two leads started out as a friendship and gradually it became romantic, which makes it that much more special. I love Lee min-ho!",1417219200,,259,4.2
4401156,5,B004LC2ZUG,"Personal Taste is a story about a guy who pretends to be gay in order to become a roommate of a female friend,who is still characterized by innocence and naivety.

Jeon Jin Ho is a straight guy who pretends to be gay in order to become a roommate to his female friend, Park Kae In. His hobbies include organization and ironing, and he's known for his stoic poker face. He's a stickler for cleanliness, but he also has a talent for figuring out a women's feelings. Kae In is very trusting even though she has a habit of being betrayed. However that doesn't stop her from giving people the benefit of doubt and Jin Ho is no different. How will Kae In react when she finds out that her gay roommate is not actually gay at all and that he has fallen for her?

It touches issues such as maturity, being organized and creative, how to hold onto life when things don't go one's way and how to become successful in business.

The leads have the greatest of chemistry. As usual, the great Son Ye-jin continues to amaze while Lee Min-Ho can stand on his own amidst the great actress. The story is a good one and a must see especially for Son Ye-jin fans.

Check this out. It definitely good entertainment.",1416614400,,1195,4.36936936936937
4401157,4,B004LC2ZUG,"This has become one of my favorite K-dramas. It's highly enjoyable, so I can watch it again and again and always be entertained. I subtract a star because of the horrible English subtitles. I'm Korean, so I don't need any subtitles, but this DVD is definitely  marketed for Asia.  If any English speaking person were to watch it, it would make no sense whatsoever!  The English subtitles were done by someone who clearly did not speak even a little bit of English. I couldn't even figure out what they were trying to convey even within the context. This is unfortunate, because it completely degraded the quality of the story.",1416614400,,626,4.724770642201835

4401169,5,B004LC2ZUG,"I loved this story. ALL the actors did a great job and it is because of that I am rating it 5. However, to those needing English subtitles, be prepared. There is a fair amount of awkward phrasing and missing words, but you can still get the gist of what is going on. I watched some episodes online and the subtitles were far better. But, I am glad I bought the DVD so I can watch this touching, funny, and sad story again and again.",1403136000,,432,4.094117647058823

Thanks for my first ever Korean Drama DVD collection.",1402185600,,361,4.388059701492537
4401171,5,B004LC2ZUG,"This is one of my all-time favorite Lee Min Ho shows. It's hilarious, romantic, and beautifully filmed. I have to say that the English translations aren't great, but I'm still really glad I bought it. I've bookmarked all my favorite scenes, and now I can watch those over and over again, at my leisure.

One of the best things about this show is the set. The story revolves around Sanggojae, the home of the protagonist, whose father is an architectural genius. The building itself is a lovely set for the film. To see a more complete review, including my movie ratings, visit my dfreviews dot com website.",1398643200,,606,4.663551401869159
4401172,5,B004LC2ZUG,"I love this DVD. It was worth the purchase. Here's a young man who has a failing company due to a much larger company trying to keep him down. I would have preferred that he told her from the beginning that there was a problem and needed to go somewhere quite to think and not continue the gay thing. Even though, he isn't the one who started it but he didn't stop it. It was fun watching how he got out of situations toward his own design that came from a gift. She actually sent him to the store for sanitary pads thinking he was gay and her inside (girlfriend) who wouldn't mind doing this for her especially where she was at the time. All in all, i love ""Personal Taste"" and watch it often even on Dramafever site, I can't get enough. You will enjoy it. The main thing is, don't allow a lie to continue even if you didn't start it but you can stop it.",1396310400,,855,4.095238095238095
4401173,5,B004LC2ZUG,"Excellent drama as many have written in  - especially as seen in DramaFever.  First of all - want to say thank you to the seller for offering this DVD on Amazon and for me receiving it so quickly, So this review is for the subtitling quality - there are many grammatical mistakes, and almost every single line has some sort of a grammatical problem - whether in meaning, in singular or plural sense, or in a tense problem - so never sure if we are talking about the future, present or past.  Also it is translated not for meaning but for word for word - which makes for very poor understanding. The following are random samples in the first few minutes of disc two - I think. Almost every line has some sort of grammatical flaw.  If subtitling is not an issue then you will really really like THIS dvd's version.  If subtitling is important - then I would try and see if there are other sellers that offer excellent subtitles.  The problem is - many times -  the excellent subtitles come with horrible visual quality made for a square screen and the picture is distorted heavily.

Here are some examples:
 ""we shouldn't rush for getting human's faith""  -
""you take care of her while she was injured - didn't you?""
It's a long time for me to be director and no one willing to chat with me...so I have no friends unconsciously""
""While I feel bored again, may I do the same thing once or twice?"".

Ultimately, I am glad I bought the dvd, but I doubt I will watch it since the subtitling is so very poor and the picture quality is middling to poor - but then what do you expect for 16 episodes compressed into 4 discs?  I gave it 5 stars because I want to encourage the watching of this excellent happy drama, but caution as to the subtitling.  If you understand Korean - the subtitling will not be a problem.  The visual quality is middling to good as can be noted in the visible pixelation on a 32 inch widescreen tv.

This is a funny cute and adorable drama  that loses tremendously due to its poor subtitling.  wish I could find another DVD seller that offers not only excellent subtitling but high visual quality.",1393027200,,2114,4.37948717948718
4401174,5,B004LC2ZUG,"An utterly charming drama that almost immediately has you laughing and continues to build your emotional attachment to the characters throughout. It's a delightful comedy, as many reviewers have pointed out, but also turns deeply, intensely emotional before it gets wrapped up. This is the show that made me realize that Lee Min-Ho (the main male character) is not just magnificent to look at, but is one amazing actor. The look in his eyes during some of the later, anguishing scenes reminded me of someone. I realized it was none other than Humphrey Bogart, who could convey a world of pain with his eyes despite his tough-guy exterior. And Son Ye Jin is spot-on as the comical, endearing female lead. My favorite Kdrama, I believe.",1392422400,,734,4.88

Lee Min Ho (Boys Over Flowers) plays the lead male, an architect with a small struggling firm that is trying to win a huge project.  To help understand what he needs to get design going in the right direction, he pretends to be gay so that he can rent a room in a house that is owned by another older designer that is out of the country.  His daughter, played by Son Ye Jin, lives there and is a furniture designer like her late mother.

The supporting cast of secondary players are excellent and help make the series and ensuing layers of story/plot lines work so well.  It's entertaining overall, has a good balance of funny, serious and romantic moments.  I enjoyed it.",1389139200,,818,4.486486486486487

The supporting cast in this series are superb (his best friend/her best friend) are absolutely priceless in their moments.  I've always thought that being friends before being lovers is a VERY important aspect of any relationship & that is what brings this show to the front of my watching queue.  The sexual chemistry is most definitely there, but being friends allows the sweetness of the growing romance to come thru so beautifully.

4401191,3,B004LC2ZUG,"Fast service, excellent quality DVD set.  English Sub-titles not the best.  Purchase only if you've seen series enough to get you through numerous broken English sub-titles.",1353801600,4,173,5.615384615384615
4401192,4,B004LC2ZUG,"This is the first Korean Drama that I have ever watched. After watching this, I was amazed at how wonderful the casts were. The casts portrayed the characters so well and definitely made me laugh and cry a ton throughout the show.",1351641600,3,230,4.5
4401193,5,B004LC2ZUG,Wonderful Drama. Enjoy finally owning my own copy. The English subs are great and there are no commercials. I can't wait to add to my library. I now own 3 Dramas!,1350345600,7,162,4.258064516129032
4401194,3,B004LC2ZUG,"My dvds have trouble playing on a few dvd players and the inside of the case wasn't set up very nicely, just dvds in plastic sleeves rather than something it can snap into. BUT, the show is one of my favorites. Lee Min Ho is so talented. <3",1349222400,2,240,4.020833333333333
4401195,4,B004LC2ZUG,"The Korean TV series ""Personal Taste"" would rate 5 stars were it not for the poor English translation. Whoever translated the Korean into English is not proficient and the viewer is required to do their own translation of the intended message. However, the story is excellent and enjoyable. The photography is also excellent. I'd recommend ""Personal Taste"" in spite of the translation issues.",1345593600,4,392,5.238095238095238
4401196,4,B004LC2ZUG,"I only give 5 stars when it's a show that I can't live without. That being said, you will find what your missing in this Korean drama. It will make you mad, laugh, and cry. But more than that you get your Min Ho Lee (Lee Min-ho) FIX, and he is no ""boy"" in this drama that's 4sure.",1344556800,12,280,3.8448275862068964
4401197,5,B004LC2ZUG,"This show had stolen my heart by the end of the first episode. It has charm, whit, and a great love story. While it is not the best kdrama out there it diffidently will always have a spot in my heart. I think they have one of the best love stories, they didn't rush the attraction but you could feel it slowly build the way real love builds. There banter back n forth was done perfectly. Lee Min Ho definitely stepped out of the boys over flowers shadow and proved he can be more than a brooding, hot, spoiled love struck teen. He smiles A LOT in this show, which that alone is reason enough to buy this show. but it today and you won't be disappointing.",1343779200,8,654,4.15748031496063

I really love the couple moments and the extreme cuteness of the male actor... if you like boys over flowers u must watch this drama :)",1343692800,3,235,4.7560975609756095

8434234,5,B004LC2ZUG,"A classic romantic comedy!  Korean dramas are one season so in 16 hours you get a beginning, middle, climax and denouement . No one is contriving strange things or trying to manipulate another season. It's a whole package of delicious silliness, sincerity, and humanity. The format works on regular American DVDs. One of the few I watch and rewatch.",1503705600,,349,4.915254237288136

The Korean did not sync up with the English subtitles at all the English subtitles were hard to read. Package was damaged upon arrival.

8434240,5,B004LC2ZUG,"I loved this movie.  I'm 72 yrs and have just started watching Korean dramas the past year or two.  they put our American movies to shame.  I probably have 15 or so in my collection.  The only complaint I have, is the sub-titles in English were horrific.  Every Korean movie I've gotten has had great sub titles..  When you totally depend on the sub-titles, it's really frustrating trying to figure out what they mean, and keep up.  The main words are in the sentences, (if you can call them sentences) but the way they're put together, leave opposite meanings a lot of times.  If I didn't have great sub-titles on all my other movies, I'd have just thought, they just can translate very well; the broken English, and all.  But this read like someone had just learned English, for no more than a couple of months.  With the subject matter of this movie, some of the translations were down right comical.  I don't know if the company used only this one translation, but they should definitely fire them and use others.",1464220800,,1017,4.56353591160221

8434242,4,B004LC2ZUG,"A really fun movie, but the English subtitles are badly written throughout, like someone fairly new to the language.  It doesn't ruin the movie by any means, but it just makes it a bit more work to watch as your mind tries to fix all the bad grammar. I THINK all the basic translations are correct, as nothing has seemed nonsensical, but I wouldn't know since I don't speak Korean.  I think that if you don't have the luxury of a totally fluent interpreter, that you could at least do the basic translation, then send a draft copy to a native English speaker to correct the grammar mistakes.",1454889600,,591,4.462962962962963
