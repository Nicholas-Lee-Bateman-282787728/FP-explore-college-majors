8170367,4,B000MOBSBE,"The Good, The Rad, and The Gnarly really isn't a ski film, because the film spends a lot of time on other sports as well, including skateboarding and freestyle bike. All of the sequences are well shot and edited as you'd expect from pretty much any Greg Stump film, but some of the interconnecting scenes with the character Harry I feel could have been trimmed a bit. Definitely my favorite Greg Stump film.",1193443200,,407,4.589041095890411
