1830612,3,B0000897B7,"This movie is about the daughter of a CEO who was born under an unlucky star.  Everything that can possibly or impossibly happen happens to her.  This time she manages to disappear to the distress of her father who tries to get her back.  Gerard Depardieu plays the man hired to find her. But the only way to find such an unlucky girl is get someone just as unlucky to retrace her steps. That's where Pierre Richard comes in!  Pierre Richard plays an employee of the CEO's who is not only an impossibly unfortunate person but he is also very oblivious about it. With Pierre Richard hired to lead Gerard Depardieu in the right direction, it is Gerard Depardieu that feels himself unlucky.  That is unlucky to be paired with such a partner. Gerard Depardieu and Pierre Richard are the French version of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. All in all, a funny movie with some very memorable moments.",1099785600,15,889,4.566037735849057
1830613,4,B0000897B7,"Give Francis Veber a whole lot of credit.  He's able to exploit the comic talents, latent or otherwise, of Gerard Depardieu as the straight man to Pierre Richard's fall guy (literally--Richard's character takes more pratfalls than one of our late presidents--the impeached kind--in a room full of old banana peels).  As the Jonah to end all Jonahs, Richard teams up with Depardieu to find the daughter of French tycoon, kidnapped in Mexico. And she herself is subject to all kinds of misfortunes.
Knowing this, the tycoon's head company psychologist theorizes that it takes a Jonah to find one, so suggests to his boss that Richard go to Mexico--accompanied by Depardieu's private investigator--to find the girl.
Hilarity ensues.  There are so many funny bits in here that it's hard to fault this comedy for any reason.  Those of you not fond of the Marx Brothers and other zingy slapstick, steer clear.  Those others who find wacko comedy refreshing and downright fun (like I do), dig in.  This is right up your alley.
Richard is perfect and Depardieu is equally great as his sometime patsy. Or should I say pratsy?  Zingy, dingy, and the perfect antidote to the recession blues.",1053734400,24,1180,4.929292929292929

It's a riot! The exotic location, Richard's amazing gifts as a physical comedian, and Depardieu's wonderful turn as the straightman combine to make this a movie that will have you laughing out loud.

1830663,5,B0000897B7,"One of my favourite movies is ""Pure Luck"" with Martin Short cast as an accident-prone innocent. Then I discovered that it was a remake of Le Chevre and bought that.. Both movies stuck to the same storyline and therein lies my dilemma. How do you compare Martin Short with Pierre Richard? In completely different ways both superbly portray a simple man blindly stumbling through one disaster after another, and accepting everything as just part of life. Ind the end, having Gerard Depardieu as his straight man gives Richard the edge. A marvellously hilarious movie from start to finish, with a truly top cast, an excellent director and finish that has you, literally, on the edge. Cannot recommend it too highly.",1380067200,3,712,4.941666666666666
1830664,4,B0000897B7,"Very funny. Depardieu and Richard play well off each other in this comedy where they are sent on a mission to retrieve the mishap-ridden daughter of a businessman. Their acting is comedy gold, especially the scene where Richard attacks Depardieu. I remember seeing the US version with Martin Short and Danny Glover, but I don't recall the title of the movie. But this was lots of fun.",1360368000,,384,4.746268656716418
1830665,5,B0000897B7,"The first pairing of the comic genius of Pierre Richard and the great Gerard Depardieu. In ""la chevre"" (""The Goat"") from 1981 and directed by Francis Veber, Richard and Depardieu were an unlikely comedy duo! After so many years, I got a chance to see this one again and laugh my head right-off. You knew from the start, this was going to be a real treat. Richard and Depardieu were dispatched to Mexico in search of a French billionaire's accident-prone daughter. So they sent the accident-prone 'Francois Perrin' (Pierre Richard) along with French P.I. 'Campana' (Gerard Depardieu) in the hopes that 'Francois' luck, or the lack of it, would put them on the trail of the missing girl! I don't know how they mamaged to keep such straight faces, with all the screwball-comedy going on. It was classic stuff, just too funny. You can't miss with this one! The film score by Vladimir Cosma was another hit. The picture quality by Kino International was very good. NTSC, French (English subtitles), NR 91 mins.

Love and Peace,

1830667,5,B0000897B7,"Very, very, very funny. Not subtitle ""was that supposed to be funny"" funny but laugh out loud funny. A little Peter Sellers- Clouseau type funny.",1319328000,,145,4.84
1830668,5,B0000897B7,"Excellent French film, great actors. Pierre Richard is one of my favorites. The movie is funny and a little naive (as all older movies are), but excellent entertainment for the whole family. May not be quite appropriate for younger kids, as there are some weapons and drug hints, as well as scenes of night life. I'd rate it as PG13. It was one of my favorite movies when I was in my teens.

Francois Perrin (Pierre Richard) is a very sweet, shy and extremely unlucky person who works as an accountant. The president of the company where he is employed has a daughter who also has unusually bad luck. When she disappears during her vacation in Mexico, the distraught father sends Perrin to accompany a private detective Campana (Gerard Depardieu) in search of her, hoping that a person as unlucky as she is will be able to retrace her steps and find her! The hilarious adventures of the two will make you want to watch this movie again!",1245715200,2,936,4.571428571428571
1830669,4,B0000897B7,"Remade less successfully as Pure Luck, the first of Pierre Richard and Gerard Depardieu's three teamings for writer-director Francis Veber, La Chevre is still the best of the bunch. Richard's the idiot accountant assigned to find a missing girl in South America simply because he's every bit as accident-prone as she is, while Depardieu's the worldly private eye who has to pretend to be working for him while really running the case and trying to keep him out of trouble. You can pretty much fill in the gaps from there, but that doesn't make it any less funny. Richard's pratfalls work not just because they're unsensationally directed rather than heavily telegraphed (one even takes place out of focus in the background) but because, like Clouseau, Richard's character doesn't know he's a clumsy idiot. In fact, he thinks he's the epitome of cool and control. But it's Depardieu who really makes the film, his underplayed exasperation and beautiful reaction shots easily the funniest thing in the film, especially as he realises with increasing fatalism that Richard's bad luck is starting to rub off.

Kino's DVD transfer suffers from being a standards conversion from PAL, which is acceptable but has some blurring not present on the Australian DVD (where the film is also available on a triple-disc set with Les Comperes and Les Fugitifs).",1157846400,15,1345,5.058558558558558
1830670,3,B0000897B7,"It is a good movie, not a great one, but it still follows an original line. A CEO sends an employee -Pierre Richard -, to find his kidnapped daughter in Mexico. He has been advised to choose him because the employee has such a bad luck, as his daughter has, that he is forcefully going to fall in the same traps and, sooner or later, in the same place than her beloved child. Gerard Depardieu does not believe in such argument and has to make a team with the bad-luck guy. Together, they will made a great team. Hillarious, entertaining and fun !.",1133654400,4,547,4.320388349514563
1830671,4,B0000897B7,"According to the film's IMDb entry, which has been updated and now appears to be accurate, the original aspect ratio (OAR) is 1.66:1 (5:3).

Kino's DVD is specified as having a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, which makes no sense.

An anamorphic transfer of a 1.66:1 film, when viewed on a 16:9 (1.77:1) widescreen TV, should be full height, and have narrow side-bars.

Can anyone comment on how the Kino DVD renders this film on a 16:9 TV?",1133049600,2,429,4.618421052631579
