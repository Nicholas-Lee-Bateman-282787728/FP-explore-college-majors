203335,5,1933591005,Great book.  I love Kirk Cameron & his sister Candace Cameron Bure.  I've read her book and have been very inspired by both of them and their stories.,1315094400,,150,4.321428571428571
203336,5,1933591005,"I heard about this book when I attended a Christian women's retreat where co-author Kirk Cameron's sister, Candace Cameron-Bure, was a speaker.  I was so blown away by her testamony, that I immediately order this book, which she highly praised.  Every Christian should read this book.  Not only does it clarify many sticky points, but it provides clear, concise guidelines for how we can all share the Good News with others.  Kudos to Ray Comfort and Kirk Cameron.",1293494400,,464,4.910256410256411
203337,5,1933591005,I say help fix because there are so many elements of a believers faith who is involved in institutionalized forms of faith that are so corrupted. One of the biggest corruptions is the almost complete inability and or unwillingness to share ones faith with the lost in a heart to heart connection that stays away from intellectual battles. This book presents addressing the unbelievers conscience with their guilt before a holy God. Comfort confronts so many false understandings believers have in how to communicate God's love to unbelievers. Most believers think the best way to give the gospel is to invite their unbelieving friends to church to hear the expert preacher. Not so. God's design is for every believer to be ready to give out the gospel straight from their heart. The most powerful gospel is the one most personal. The closer the contact the more powerful the impact. Our God is a personal relationship God. His gospel should be given in personal relationship. God has chosen the weak things of the world to show His glory. He doesn't desire expert dependency.,1278720000,2,1075,4.912087912087912
203338,5,1933591005,"A great study with a refreshing point of view.  The one caveat I would offer is that you really need to buy this with the kit which is $99, it's not something that's a stand-alone product.  Generally, this is something that would be purchased as a ""textbook"" for the Way of the Master course.  It should not be seen as a stand-alone book.",1252195200,4,338,4.333333333333333
203340,2,1933591005,"This book would be great if you are actually in a class but other wise not so much, i think that the book The Way Of The Master has enough info and verses to go by, you really don't need this one",1217462400,6,195,3.6666666666666665
203341,5,1933591005,The Way of the Master is an excellent introduction to personal evangelism.  The on-the-street witnessing clips are powerful and illustrative of the approach the program teaches.  Our adult Sunday School class is excited about this.  It has proven very effective.,1206921600,2,262,5.5
203342,5,1933591005,"Kirk Cameron and Ray Comfort have teamed up to produce what I think is a great witnessing tool.  May authors use the approach that accepting Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior of your life will make you feel happy and fulfilled in this life.  Instead, Cameron and Comfort use the Old Testament Law (10 Commandments) to show how EVERYONE at some point and time in their life has broken at least one of the commandments and is danger of God's judgement.  Additionally, the emphasis is also on the next life since we will spend far more time in heaven or hell than here on earth.

We had this course taught at our church and the basic class format is as follows:  go over what we learned from the previous week's assignment, watch the DVD that goes with the book, discuss the DVD, and go over next week's assignment.

The book's chapters are as follows:

1.  Cultivating Compassion for the Lost.

2.  Discovering Hell's Best Kept Secret.

3.  Learning to Overcome Fear.

4.  Practicing What You Preach.

5.  Crafting the Message.

6.  Answering the Top Ten Questions.

7.  Exposing the Myth of the Modern Message.

8.  Spreading Your Wings.

If you or your church are looking for another witnessing tool, this is an excellent one to consider.

Enjoy reading the book and be challenged. Highly recommended!",1175126400,24,1299,4.671111111111111
203344,5,1933591005,"This book is used along side the DVD version.  It is like nothing you have seend before!

Do people say that you are a good person?  Maybe you think you really are good in Gods eyes.

Do you really understand why Jesus had to die for your sin?

Way of the Master Basic training shows you how God sees your sin and how to share your faith without getting into an argument.  Do you know someone who is not saved?  A mother, father, brother, sister or just a friend?  Then this training material is for you.  It may even help you to answer those hard questions that come up around the office.  WOTM has helped me to share my faith more boldly, but most importantly biblically. The way Jesus did.",1151366400,18,692,4.253846153846154
203345,5,1933591005,"This will wake you up if you are a complacent Christian (it woke me up!) and will encourage you to get completely out of your comfort zone. It goes along with the DVDs and is ideal for group study.  It has questions that will help you dig into the Bible for a deeper study, and has ""homework"" that will slowly help you develop compassion for the lost, and get over your fear of evangelism.  This book has changed my life more than any other (besides the Bible).",1444262400,,461,4.287356321839081
