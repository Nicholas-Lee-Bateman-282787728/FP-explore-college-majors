6931735,3,B00RJXKUOM,"Since John Hughes' untimely passing, I've been hoping for a box set of his work that includes all of his greatest.

Actually, there are surprisingly only 8 films that he directed, so it really shouldn't be that hard to put them together in one set. In addition to the three here, you have Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, She's Having a Baby, Uncle Buck, and Curly Sue.

One problem is that four of these are from Universal (THIS set is not even a complete Universal set since Uncle Buck was also distributed from that studio), three are from Paramount, and Curly Sue is from Warner Bros (however, I won't shed a tear if that one was NOT included).

They could also throw in some of the films he wrote but didn't direct but that have that undeniable John Hughes feel, such as Mr. Mom, Pretty in Pink, Some Kind of Wonderful, Home Alone, and Dutch.

I'm hoping that these studios can work together to deliver a nice collection of John Hughes' work one day, much as they did with Stanley Kubrick. I think he deserves to be honored.",1426032000,10,1055,4.507853403141361

6931741,2,B00RJXKUOM,"The movies are what they are. Beloved if somewhat alarmingly dated. Your opinion of them is probably already set in stone.

However, the digital code for Weird Science is not actually valid. If you email Universal about it, they'll tell you they don't offer it, anymore. (Strange, since they're, you know, selling it.) They will offer you a different movie, instead. One of the options is Breakfast Club, which you have already paid for if you've bought this. Another is--I kid you not--Howard the Duck.

So, yeah, I'm not really sure how they're selling this as ""Blu Ray + Digital."" It's just Blu Ray.",1526688000,,602,4.778846153846154

I contacted Universal support about that and I was told ""Sixteen Candles and Weird Science is currently not available for UltraViolet redemption. However, we value you as a customer & will issue you a free code for Edge Of Seventeen and Howard the Duck.""

My biggest concern is that the movie came in last week from Amazon and when I tried to enter the digital codes, only the Breakfast Club movie went through.  The other two would not work.  I wrote to Universal and they told me the codes were expired.  They offered codes to two other movies, which I would not have picked normally.

Home screen plays many scenes that depict important/surprise moments that a viewer may prefer to wait for while watching the actual movie
Photo insert is different (not ""yearbook"" style"" photos of various characters shown in online photo)

6931851,5,B00RJXKUOM,"For anyone who was a young adult in the 80s, this set will bring back great memories.  The Blu-ray copies of each movie look great, especially The Breakfast Club.  There are some bonus features you will really love.  If you came of age in the 80s and still remember the Brat Pack fondly, or even if you just like 80s films, you can't go wrong with this set.",1441152000,4,357,4.220588235294118
6931852,5,B00RJXKUOM,I love John Hughes movies and this box set is just what I was looking for. I owned all of these movies separately on DVD and none of them had any of the special features listed on this blu ray set. I took this opportunity to get rid of my DVD's and switch over to blu ray. It takes up less space and has way more bonus features on it. Great to re-watch all of these classic movies and I grew up with. Great price and a great box set.,1440892800,4,433,3.8222222222222224

6931872,4,B00RJXKUOM,"I watched these three movies last way back when VHS was THE only video medium and never bought the DVDs so it was refreshing to watch them again as a collection. I liked both THE BREAKFAST CLUB and SIXTEEN CANDLES and even remembered bits and pieces, but WEIRD SCIENCE, not so much. A nice addition to my library.",1427414400,,313,4.413793103448276
6931873,5,B00RJXKUOM,"The John Hughes Yearbook Collection gathers together three of the legendary and sadly deceased filmmaker's most celebrated 80's films The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, and Weird Science. All three films had been released on bluray before. The discs of Weird Science and Sixteen Candles are the same as were released a couple or so years ago.
The Breakfast Club however got a brand new remastered transfer which is a considerable improvement over the original bluray released a few years back and is dubbed as the 30th Anniversary Edition (and is also available separately for purchase from this collection as well). The new transfer boasts a very noticeable increase in fine detail and also features a warmer and more lifelike feel as a whole. The original bluray had just used an ancient old HD master used for the DVD release so fans will be thrilled to see the film looking better than it ever has. Extras are the same as the first bluray release with the addition of a new trivia track.

Sadly Universal didn't see fit to also remaster Weird Science and Sixteen Candles. Not that the existing bluray transfers look bad by any means but there is a lot of room for improvement. Weird Science fares the worst with a transfer that while better than the old  DVD still looks not as good as it could. The opening scene looks pretty rough but it does get better as it goes along. Sixteen Candles doesn't suffer from all of the same issues but after you see how amazing The Breakfast Club looks in its new remastered edition, it will have you longing for new transfers for the other two films as well.

This is still a great buy for people who don't own any of these 3 fine 80's classics on bluray yet. You get an amazing new transfer for The Breakfast Club along with decent transfers for the other two films that look better than their DVD counterparts. Highly  recommended!",1426896000,42,1875,4.6555891238670695
