3531304,2,B001DJ7PQE,"Compared to the incredible computer animation that's been around since ""Shrek"" this really pales in comparison. The backgrounds and characters have an ""unfinished"" look about them. The story line is indeed week as stated in another review. ""Harold Kelp"" has a habit of screaming every 3 or 4 minutes which becomes annoying in a very short time. The only reason for taking a look at this movie is for the fact that Jerry Lewis did contribute his voice to the project.

Kids should enjoy it.",1232668800,,489,4.752941176470588
3531305,5,B001DJ7PQE,This is one of the cutest and funniest Drake Bell was wonderful his voice was so exciting and adorable it was like the movie came to life it was better than the original movie and Jerry Lewis was as always hilarious as well god I had no idea Drake Bell could sound so much like Jerry Lewis you would think they really were related.,1232323200,2,331,4.1875
3531306,5,B001DJ7PQE,My five year old son got this as a gift from a family member and it was surprisingly good! Super entertaining and full of gags and cutting edge action sequences. This ranks among the years best animated films. It was great  to see Jerry Lewis again as well. He plays both the title character and his alter ego  Buddy Love from the original. At 82 years old his performance is hilarious and was nice to see this version of the franchise more closely tied to the original than the Eddie Murphy versions. Drake Bell is excellent as Harold and Jack and the supporting characters are superb.,1230595200,5,586,4.518867924528302

When Harold gets his hands on the recipe for his grandfather's secret elixir, he creates a potion that drastically transforms his personality to be more confident and suave. Unfortunately his alter ego is also obnoxious and destructive. Much like his grandfather before him, Harold must face his insecurities and fears while learning to believe in himself without the help of any special concoctions.

The cartoonbrew site also states this movie, done all in CG, will feature the voice of Jerry Lewis, the original Nutty Professor, as the dad! The site has an image.",1224806400,2,586,5.030927835051546

OK I give it 5 stars.

NUTTY PROFESSOR CARTOON REVIEW

This 2008 straight-to-video is an animated sequel to the original Nutty Professor (1963). The hero is Julius Kelp's grandson, Harold, whose teenage turmoil inspires him to use his grandpa's formula to transform into his own cool alter-ago, Jack (no last name -- ""Just Jack. That's how I roll""). It isn't as big nor lavish as Shrek or Disney animated films, but it is good enough, a nice story.

Trivia note: Jerry's adopted daughter, Danielle Lewis has a small part -- a bald girl wielding a bow and arrow named ""Suzy"" whose hair fell out because of a hairdryer invention of Harold Kelp. She has only a scream and about 2 lines (""Say goodnight, Brainiac!"") because Jerry would only allow that much (in the making-of, he admits he didn't want her to outshine him: ""it has to be small because I have to star."").

[interesting that the character is named Suzy, when Jerry's biological, illegitimate child is also named Suzan, but this would be a coincidence, because this came out in 2008, while news about Suzan Lewis went public in 2009.]
Drake Bell, the voice of Harold does Jerry Lewis impressions which helped him to get this role. I would like to have seen sequels to this --and to have Stella Stevens reprise her role, but she was not invited, I guess.",1408752000,,1525,4.6162361623616235

8293662,5,B001DJ7PQE,"My kids had this movie but a relative took it back to Florida with them and could not find it, they wanted this movie again, I went to find it at the store and was unable to, I ordered it online with Walmart waited a month and it never came, found it on Amazon through this seller and I got the movie within 4 days, my kids were very happy and so was I, they no longer begged me for the movie.  Thank you so much!!!!",1313107200,,416,3.8372093023255816
8293663,5,B001DJ7PQE,"I saw this on here about 3 weeks ago looking for the 1963 version and stumbled upon a 2008 CGI remake of it and I thought oh no someone else is going to destroy Jerry Lewis's masterpiece and as soon as I saw The King of Comedy Jerry Lewis as a character, I just had to get it no questions asked. I watched it and man I knew he wouldn't do it unless he could have it done in his ""unique"" way and I wasn't disappointed. This is kinda of a sequel from the original in 1963 with Stella Stevens, Jerry Lewis, and Kathleen Morgan. His grandson has failed at a competition and is trying to impress a girl he likes. Well, he finds his grandfather's Buddy Love juice I'll call it and and tries it on himself and the results are close to that of when professor Kelp tried it in 1963. Loved the originality, Jerry Lewis, and also some pretty good CGI for this family style movie. Loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!",1264982400,4,889,4.204678362573099
8293664,4,B001DJ7PQE,Both I and my 9 year old son enjoyed this movie. i growing up with jerry lewis and the original nutty profesor like the different spin this one put on it.  My son just enjoyed it for the 1st time.,1259107200,,196,3.9
8293665,3,B001DJ7PQE,"The movie is alright......but the bonus is having the one and only
Jerry Lewis helps by lending his voice for one of the Characters.
Even the animators did their best to not only hear Jerry , but to see
him through his character...good job guys/gals.
The movie itself is not too bad...3 stars.",1245801600,,293,4.547169811320755
8293666,4,B001DJ7PQE,"I must admit, I was intrigued(yet a little skeptical) when I seen that a CGI version of The Nutty Professor had been made. Course, when I seen that Jerry Lewis was doing a voice in the movie, I decided to get the DVD. To be sure, Jerry Lewis wouldn't do something like this if it didn't do his original vision justice. Well, I was right in that assumption. This movie, even though it is directed more towards kids, is a fun CGI film that is nearly on par with the likes of ""Open Season"" and ""Ice Age"" with some pretty decent CGI.

The plot, itself, is about a kid named Harold Kelp.  When his grandfather, Julius,  offers him the opportunity to attend a high tech school, the boy jumps at the chance. Hoping to impress a girl he has his eye on, he works on a class project to build-race and win an annual school bike challenge but he fails.  When he stumbles across his grandfather's database, he learns of a formula that can make him charismatic, and coordinated. Yet, the potion soon unleashes his deepest and darkest fears & that's when things get interesting.

While it may not be Pixar quality CGI and filmmaking, it still is a fun and decent romp into the world of The Nutty Professor again. I highly recommend it. I think kids and adults will like this take. I loved it. I really loved it!!!",1233705600,7,1298,4.369294605809128
