3422197,5,B00191AF18,"This movie was absolutely beautiful. Though the ending isn't exactly happy, it ends in a way I would have preferred it to. The acting is great and the plot is very subtle and not overdone, which is usually what happens with movies that promise what this movie does. They executed it beautifully.",1359849600,2,295,4.6923076923076925
3422198,5,B00191AF18,"""Down the River"" is a gay movie directed by Anucha Boonyawatana. Krit (played by the handsome actor Prakasit Horwannapakorn) and Vin (played by sexy Napong Viriyasomboon) are two high-school students before graduation. Can two boys' first love survive the demands of becoming adults? Like Wong Kar Wai's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Happy-Together-Special-Edition/dp/B001O2UTRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Happy Together (Special Edition)</a>, ""Down the River"" isn't an action movie. It tells its story by painting sensual scenes. Very Thai: Beautiful male middle class youths in school uniforms. If you believe in love, it is a serious film, though it asks more questions than it answers.

We see the boys in the jungle: Krit wants to go on until the seventh cascade of Pachang waterfalls in Surat Thani, while Vin feels pity for the two girls they brought along who are getting tired. We see the two boys under a Kapok tree: Krit tries to hold on to the moment and loses the present in his futile effort to preserve it; Vin is getting bored because he doesn't fear time as much as his friend does. We see them making love. Krit is gay, but is Vin gay too? We don't know it. Like in real life, there is no happy end. This ""True Story"" feel is not the least charm of ""Down the River"".

Visually, ""Down the River"" is a stunning movie, particularly if you consider that it is a student movie. Almost magic images (camera Kritsada Kaniwichaporn and Wanchalerm Plaibua), good-looking actors, sexy director, entrancing soundtrack (music by Varoot Pasutadol). I guessed that they used the newest Sony professional video equipment, but in fact, they used an old 16mm camera.

That the Film Department of Chulalongkorn University, Thailand's most prestigious university, produced a gay film of such high quality, tells a lot about the state of gay affairs in Thailand.",1330560000,8,1905,5.301324503311259
