8003073,3,B0000UJM90,"Stephen Baldwin is certainly a busy actor.  I've often found him profoundly effective in his low-key, almost somnolent performances, and in this average by the number thriller, Baldwin's laconic delivery works.  He plays Salvatore Veronica, a mob hitman who decides to rat on a notorious biggie, and is therefore placed in the witness protection program.  As Sal Vincent, he and his family are relocated to a quiet little city, where his neighbor and realtor (a game Peter Gallagher) offers him work.  Of course, with Sal's shady past, one can see it's going to be hard for Sal to walk the straight and narrow, so he gets involved with a local mobster, played with grim relish by Aron Tager, and soon Sal's cover is broken and all heck breaks loose.  Baldwin and Gallagher develop a nice rapport and the ending is refreshingly unpredictable.  Katie Griffin does a nice turn as Baldwin's wife, as does Deborah Odell as Gallagher's.  The movie sometimes slows down a little in places where it shouldn't, but the overall film is enjoyable and much better than a lot of these ""unknown"" dvd thrillers.",1112140800,2,1096,4.860215053763441
