2248137,5,B0007X9UD8,I highly recommend this DVD for anyone that has been wounded spiritually and/or emotionally. The Holyghost anointing that illuminates Nei-Knight gift of ministering through songs ultimately delivers OUR Balm in Gilead -Our LORD and Saviour Jesus Christ.  Glory be to God the floodgates of healing flowing like the Niagara Falls.  If your heart has been wrapped up in barbwire this DVD will start the process of being healed and retored.,1188259200,4,436,5.214285714285714

8053304,1,B0007X9UD8,"I try to support African American work, so with that in mind, I jumped blindly and bought this movie.  I watched the first half and thought it was awful!  I see why it was so inexpensive.  The singing in this movie was pre-recorded!  I couldn't believe that.  It was very obvious that the actors were not actually singing during the scene.  I'm sure it was their voices on the recorded version, but blending it in with the movie did not enhance the movie at all.  The storyline was poor; it had no real purpose.  I forced myself to stomach the rest of it, trying to give it a fair chance and to see whether it would get better, and it didn't.  I disliked this movie so much, I didn't even want it to remain in my house, even if it meant losing money on the deal.  I highly recommend that you do NOT waste your money on this one.",1318291200,,828,4.150943396226415
8053305,1,B0007X9UD8,"OMG, amazon this was a mess, only thing good on this movie is the singing and music, even though the singers are not singing themselves, this was a waste, I should have listened to other reviews, I was warned.  Please don't sell this to your customers, if actors got paid they should tithed their earnings, and take the rest to get acting lessons, especially the guy girl.",1315699200,,372,4.552238805970149
8053306,1,B0007X9UD8,"I don't remember seeing anyone in the movie that's on the cover. TERRRIIIIBBBBLLLLEEEEE! If you want it, I'll send it to you FOR FREE! =X",1309996800,,137,4.52
8053307,1,B0007X9UD8,"This movie was poorly done.  The sound off and the talking didn't match the actors.  I didn't understand the concept from the beginning.

I wouldn't recommend this to anyone and trying to send back.",1308700800,,198,4.764705882352941
8053308,3,B0007X9UD8,"I knew I bought three movies, but I couldn't remember watching three movies - until I put this one back in the DVD player.  ""Oh Yeah!!, I did watch that one!"" is what I said.  All I can say is Get Thee behind me.  Try to find a sale price if you have to buy it.",1308528000,,261,3.625
8053309,1,B0007X9UD8,"AMAZON, you must be slipping!!!  How in the world could you offer this trash on your website?  Poor acting skills, a pitiful drag queen, and what's with the ""pop up"" comments?

Come on, y'all!  Times CAN'T be so hard that you need to offer this cinematic fiasco!!!  I really wish I had saved my $2.99 + shipping and handling and bought a couple of gallons of gas!

PLEASE don't buy this film.  The only plus of this movie is that they used good cameras.  The picture quality is wonderful, but the content is horrific!

Take my advice, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!",1304726400,4,581,4.40566037735849
8053310,1,B0007X9UD8,"I purchased this movie because the description sounded interesting, but this movie was hands down a huge waste of time. The dialogue  and acting was bad and the only redeeming quality from the movie was the music. It was such a poorly produced film that I couldn't get past that to enjoy the moral of the story. I'm glad I only paid $2.99 for this movie. Save your money!",1295827200,4,371,4.3768115942028984
8053311,5,B0007X9UD8,"This is a soothing & healing dvd for the brokenhearted from life's unexpected curves.  Some times life wounds us SO DEEP that we become accustomed to the pain, LET GO & LET GOD BE OUR BALM IN GILEAD!!!!!",1268006400,,203,4.342105263157895
