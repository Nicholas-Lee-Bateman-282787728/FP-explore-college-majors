7954815,5,B00005UNB4,"Writing Sessions, the writing/publishing component of Inside Sessions, represents another area of synergy. ""Inside Sessions allows us to bring together the publishing expertise of Penguin Putnam and the education expertise of Pearson to create a very strong course,"" Schline said.
Available either in streaming video or on CD, Writing Sessions incorporates 10 ""sessions"" or chapters, ranging from ""The Realities of the Writing Life"" to ""How to Approach Publishers"" to ""What's Next? The Author and the Future of Publishing."" Within each session, a browser view displays a window for streaming video, links to references and biographies, and a text window highlighting key elements of the narration. Viewers can also choose a full screen version of the talking heads, but the browser view provides more options, allowing users to view speaker bios and other course materials in context with the videos.

Inside Sessions Senior Vice President Lori DeWolfe noted, ""Phyllis Grann was the critical player in attracting the participants for the writing program. Kurt Vonnegut, Tom Clancy, Amy Tan, Nick Hornby and David McCullough are a few of the participants she brought on board. All Writing Sessions participants, including those recruited by Grann, were excited to share their real-world experiences and insights with people who aspire to follow in their footsteps.""

Schline, himself a contributor to the course, feels especially proud of its scope, which spans genres and generations. ""I might also mention that the course includes some really great advice from literary agents and publishing lawyers -- information which would be really hard to get if you weren't in the business,"" he said.

Writing Sessions provides tremendous insight into Penguin Putnam operations and how the company works with agents and lawyers to create and nurture its stable of top-selling writers. Grann and PPI colleagues such as Neil Nyren, Susan Peterson Kennedy and Stephen Rubin describe their missions and methods. Attorney Robert Levine's remarks underscore the importance of agents and lawyers to the professional writer. In addition, the straight -- if potentially scary -- skinny on publicity from the publisher's perspective may be worth the price of admission all by itself.

Writing Sessions functions best as ""senior seminar"" on for professionally minded writers who've already spent some time honing their craft. The course's content presupposes that users possess the maturity and sophistication to objectively assess their work against that of the featured writers.

But fans of participating writers (see inset) will find much to applaud. Writing Sessions presents its literary stars in a continuous video stream taken from lengthy interviews. Famous curmudgeons expand on their reputations. At the other end of the spectrum, Michael Datcher exhorts writers to shoot for greatness, while Jayne Anne Krentz cautions, ""The most notable feature of a work is most likely to be the most controversial.""

To take a page from Krentz, Writing Sessions' kaleidoscope of perspectives may be its greatest gift to aspiring writers, but it may also serve as the greatest stumbling block for those seeking a single, foolproof recipe for literary success. From the mouths of the writers themselves, almost anything goes. Are you a closet Luddite? A. Scott Berg still puts all his notes on index cards. Do you start with ""What if"" and go from there? Nora Roberts understands. Obsessed with the dance of words on a page? Meet Chang-Rae Lee, who will rewrite a line as many times as it takes to get it right.",1195948800,,3586,5.349290780141844
