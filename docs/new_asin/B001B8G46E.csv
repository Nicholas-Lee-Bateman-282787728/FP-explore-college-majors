In every situation, people leave feeling inspired, uplifted, and challenged to do things to improve the lives of others or themselves. It is a moving film that moves people's hearts.  I can't recommend it highly enough.",1280707200,,345,4.655737704918033
8282195,5,B001B8G46E,"In Texas they have developed an innovative program that teaches art classes to the homeless. This film follows several of the artists over a year, through their classes, their daily life, and ultimately an art show where they're helped to sell their work. This film is inspiring not just for the way that it helps this group of individuals learn to support themselves partly through their art, but even more how this disenfranchised group is allowed to find a voice and communicate their experience to the world. One of the many moving moments in the film is watching the artists interact with people at their art show, both seeing how proud they are of their work but also how people with such different experiences are allowed a window into their world through their art, which is what great art is about.",1267488000,2,807,4.7304964539007095
