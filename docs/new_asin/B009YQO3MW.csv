6589126,5,B009YQO3MW,"I frigging loved this movie! Not overly done with typical Adam Sandler douchebaggery. Well written, great cast. I would definitely watch it again!

I'd love to tell you all about it, but you just have to see it to appreciate it!",1350432000,,228,4.560975609756097
6589127,4,B009YQO3MW,"I had friends like these when I was growing up. They're all dead now. But, this movie was funny. James Cann is as frightening as ever.",1350345600,,134,4.1923076923076925
6589128,5,B009YQO3MW,If you loved happy gilmore or water boy then you will love this one. His old comedy style is back and hella funny!,1350345600,,114,4.0
6589129,3,B009YQO3MW,"""You were basically the worst parent ever, you let me eat cake and lollipops for breakfast everyday."" Donny (Sandler) is a 13 year old boy who has moved on from girls. He now likes only women. After a statement gets him sent to detention with the one that he loves things go to far and a baby is born. With the mother in jail Donny is left to raise his son alone. Todd (Samberg) is now all grown up and getting married and Donny finds himself in trouble with the IRS. Thinking his last hope of staying out of jail he goes to find Todd for help. I have to admit that I was not looking forward to this movie at all. I have been a big Adam Sandler fan for a while but after ""Jack & Jill"" and seeing the preview for this I was very leary. While this is not among Sandler's best and I will probably never watch this again I do have to say that this was much funnier then I was expecting. As a warning though this is not a typical family style Sandler movie, there is a ton of swearing and nudity and sex humor that the R rating is very justified. Mixed in with the typical Sandler movie cameos are some very raunchy but funny scenes that as gross as they are you can't help but laugh at, at least I couldn't. For fans of Sandler this will be hilarious, for those that just like comidies this may be a little much but still funny. Overall, 100 times better then ""Jack & Jill"" but still not close to the classics that Sandler started off with. I will say this was much much better then I was expecting though. I give it a B-.",1350345600,,1518,4.0633333333333335
6589130,5,B009YQO3MW,"This movie is so funny that I was laughing out loud the whole time. My family took me to see it on Father's Day and all five of us were laughing the whole time, including my wife and even daughter (who usually doesn't go for the cruder humor).  I pre-ordered the blu ray and everyone here is anxiously awaiting its arrival for a family movie night!  This movie is funny from the moment that teenage boy thinks he is going to hit on his teacher till the feel good ending.  I am glad Adam Sandler wasn't worried about trying to please all the whiny people out there that might get offended at a the slightest thing that isn't ""PC"".  It felt like a movie that finally lived up to a Happy Madison Production name (a combination of the title of his first two movies Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore).  This is the humor that makes me laugh on his CD's.  The movie is rated ""R"" meaning it is not a family movie and yes everyone in my family is old enough to see it.  So if you have a good sense of humor, don't get easily offended and want to really laugh then I recommend you see this movie.  If you think this is going to be a nice family movie, or think all movies should be ""PG-13"" or lower even when they are rated ""R"" don't waste your time.",1350172800,12,1239,4.133333333333334
6589131,4,B009YQO3MW,"it takes a lot to make me laugh... and let me tell you at parts this movie had me rolling! so funny! I would not recommend this to everyone though, some people may find it really stupid and immature, but if you have a good sense of humour and are not scared to let the teenager out of you and have a good laugh than you owe it to yourself to watch this movie! Definitely one of Sanders' best....... and a nice breath of fresh air after that tragedy which was jack and jill.",1349654400,8,473,4.042553191489362
6589132,5,B009YQO3MW,I personally love the movie I saw it awhile ago and have been waiting a while for the blu ray. Overall very funny movie. I recomend it for any one 16 to 30,1347408000,5,155,3.727272727272727
6589133,4,B009YQO3MW,"I'm a very hard person to make laugh when it comes to comedies, primarily because they're one of my favorite genres of film, thus meaning I've seen a vast amount of them. Out of all of these, Adam Sandler's films have historically given me some of the funniest bits I've ever seen, such as ""Happy Gilmore"", ""Billy Madison"", and ""The Waterboy."" Heck, I even enjoyed ""You Don't Mess With The Zohan."" However, last year's ""Jack and Jill"" was an unfortunate misstep for the beloved comedian, being completely devoid of laughs and making me wonder if Sandler was beginning to lose his touch. Seeing reviews for his newest film, ""That's My Boy"", didn't exactly inspire a load of confidence. But being a fan, I gave it a shot, and I'm glad I did. His newest outing is one of his best, and one of the most alarmingly funny films I've seen in years. Don't listen to the critics, folks, this is Sandler and SNL vet Andy Samberg doing what they do best: being raucous, dirty, and downright gut-busting.

Sandler plays Donny, who knocked up his beautiful teacher while he was going through puberty. The state forced the child upon him while his teacher got sent to prison, and the results weren't pretty. They were so hideous, in fact, that his child grew up and made up a fake story about his parents being dead just to escape from his dad. It paid off: the son, Han Solo aka Todd (played by Samberg), became one of the youngest hedge fund managers and began raking in the money, thus making him an eligible bachelor for his fiance, played by the lovely Leighton Meester. Dear old dad, on the other hand, grew up to be white trash and desperately in need of money in order to pay taxes stretching back to 1994. When finding out that his kid is successful, Donny aims to get the whole family back together in order to make bank from a TV deal. When party animal and uptight businessman collide... well, you've seen movies like this, so you can begin to guess what kind of antics ensue.

Only you can't, and that's what makes this movie so funny. Using the ""R"" rating to its full advantage, Sandler and Samberg flip up the lid on their potty mouthes and don't let it down until the credits roll. Much like this year's ""Ted"", ""That's My Boy"" is the latest in a rash of comedies that are unafraid to be truly raunchy. From the borderline offensive premise to one of the funniest masturbation jokes in recent memory, everything about this movie is incredibly rude and crude. This is the kind of film that Sandler belongs in, though, and not neutered junk like ""Jack and Jill"", or family tripe like ""Bedtime Stories."" When he's told to go all out, he does it with great gusto. For the first time in years, I had a fun time watching Sandler, and was reminded of his older work.

What makes this film rise above typical Sandler fare, though, is the stellar supporting cast, the most important member of which is Samberg. When both of the characters are together, the sparks fly, and you can see a look in both actors' eyes indicating that they're having a truly great time making this movie. Solo, Samberg is a capable comedian, but with one of the greats, he's solid gold. There are several times when it seems obvious that both actors are improvising their banter, but with such a gifted duo, that's not a bad thing. Only one or two jokes turn up flat, and their sour taste is quickly washed away.

With sex gags galore, a great supporting cast, a suitably cheesy soundtrack (when's the last you got to hear some Ratt?), and a surprise appearance by Susan Sarandon, still aging like fine wine, ""That's My Boy"" is not a great film. It is, however, a great comedy, and the heartfelt message at the climax definitely elevated it a few notches above some recent Happy Madison flicks. If you're a fan of Sandler, Samberg, or just laughing in general, this movie comes with a hearty recommendation from me. Just remember to breathe, because I had a hard time doing so in the middle of cracking up throughout the whole film.

Overall: B (Recommended, But Not For Everyone)",1346025600,10,4048,4.5473251028806585

6589138,2,B009YQO3MW,"This movie has so many bad things going for it.  It starts off with a student teacher sex relationship.  The teacher goes to prison and he gets rich with his story.  Then blows all his money.  And is going to go to prison himself if he doesn't come up with 50,000 dollars in back taxes he owes to the IRS.  He has a son out of the teacher relationship who also hits it big,.  He tracks him down.  And of course doesn't fit in with the rest of the family.  But  worms his way in and pretty soon wins everybody over and then his son doesn't quite fit in.  Like I said there are a lot of bad things about this movie.  Which also has a brother sister incest relationship.  But it does have Abigail Klein in a very very small role role.  I think she might have one line.  Although she is in a few scenes.  She was a Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader.  Adam Sandler hands her a beer in the hot tub.  In case your wondering.  Anyway her brief screen time keeps the movie from being a complete waste.  I would like to add after doing movies like Happy Gilmore and The Wedding Singer.  Then making movies like this.

6589144,5,B009YQO3MW,"I'm going to make a controversial statement here: this is the funniest movie of the past decade! This is not your typical Sandler film, it has more of a Farrelly brothers feel to it. It is raunchy, it is politically incorrect, it touches on a lot of taboos, and boy is it fun if you allow yourself to just flow with it. There are so many small nuances (likes peoples' reactions to these bizarre situations), quirky one-liners, and just a general outright ridiculousness of this film that is so...refreshing and liberating. Plus, the father-son dynamic with Sandler and Andy Samberg is oddly heart-warming. This film is so grossly underrated, I wish more folks would give it a shot.",1519776000,3,681,4.779661016949152

Adam Sandler plays his usual brand of dirtbag man/child (tho, in an interview, Sandler seems to think this is a departure for him & he usually plays nice guy... yeah). While Samberg embarrasses himself as a, surprise!, whiny man/child.

The whole movie is a circle jerk of 'comedy', and wish fulfilment, that was funny when you were 12. We watched the first 20 min. Mostly just did the eye-rolls, fidgety bored faces & the 'ugh' sound. Finally, we just turned it off.

Sure, it is formula to the bone, but it is executed quite well. And look at this remarkable cast! Ice is doing his best Tyson cameo, but pulls it off quite well.

6589236,1,B009YQO3MW,"I am a big fan of Adam sandler's films, mainly the ones he did back in early 2000's til 2010
like GROWN UPS, GROWN UPS 2, THE LONGEST YARD, CLICK, LITTLE NICKY are really good Adams sandler films
Good storylines and some really Great Gags very Humourous, not offensive there's a big Difference
i'm sorry i think this film THAT'S MY BOY is his Sandler's worst
most of the Joke's in the film were just completely stupid & silly, more offensive than funny
actually the scenes that was just plain stupid i had to fast forward a bit the scenes were hard to watch
that's how offensive the scenes were, one of many scenes that come to mind
is when Todd played by Actor Andy samberg comes home very late from all night Drinking binge with his Dad Donny
and then masturbates/ejaculates over his Fiance's wedding Dress, i mean really.
i'm sorry that's just plain stupid and offensive i was more shocked than anything
the storyline is pathetic & so are the Jokes
i think this film is more based on Adam sandler's self Indulgence rather than impressing his Fans
the films runtime is very long 110mins of crude offensive Humour, more crude Humour than i can sit through
yes sure Adams previous films do have some crude & offensive jokes aswell, but there's a balance with the Humour
this THAT'S MY BOY is completely the opposite there's no balance with the Jokes, just all out offensiveness

6589251,5,B009YQO3MW,"I absolutely loved this comedy flick, but I must inform you that it is definitely not a film you can sit around with your family and LOL with munchies and soda. The wife would seriously be offended by some of the trash in this film. A younger woman in her late-teens/early-20's might like it if she was kind of a tough tomboy type. It's more of a guy's get-together to watch a raunchy flick, or gals that like that kind of humor. What I enjoy most about this comedy is the cavalcade of stars in it. Some of the comedy by these stars made me just roar with laughter. The star list is too numerous to mention, but it's a story about a son who hit it rich in the financial world after he's born a product of a teacher-student relationship (character played by Andy Samberg from Adam Sandler and Eva Amurri Martino's characters, later played by her mother, Susan Sarandon, later on in life when she's serving the maximum 30 year sentence for statutory rape of a junior high school kid). When Samberg (Han Solo, changes his name to Todd Peterson to get away from a tough childhood being raised by a child himself, Sandler/Donnie) hits it big, he has rich bosses and co-workers and decides to marry Jamie (Leighton Meester). The wedding is going to be at Cape Cod and is on the cover of a society magazine when Donnie/Sandler finds out about the big event. He then tracks down Han Solo/Todd Peterson not only to be involved, but because he needs to pay the IRS $50,000 to avoid prison time. He does what he can to try and score that dough to make life easier, but runs into all kinds of mayhem. What could go wrong? Everything! He figures he can't do anymore wrong and puts down $20.00 to his bookie (Rex Ryan), who thinks he's found a hidden gem in a gigantic, overweight marathon runner by the name of Tubby Tuke in the upcoming NY City(?) Marathon at 8000/1 odds. He figures he has nothing to lose, but the $20.00. After a rough weekend, to say the least, at the Cape, Donnie's bookie comes running into the nudie bar, where everyone is saying goodbye to Donnie before he goes to prison, and tells everybody there to turn on the TV where Tubby Tuke rallies to come away victorious in the big marathon race, and Donnie wins $160,000 and stays out of the big house.",1452988800,,2260,4.409090909090909

The world is a dumber place for having this movie in it. Even diehard Adam Sandler fans will struggle to find anything redeeming in a movie that starts with the statutory rape of a 13-year-old and works up to puerile adolescent humor.

They must have really sad lives and live in their Grandparents basement. The movie also has a killer soundtrack of classic rock!",1430524800,,649,4.508474576271187

6589354,5,B009YQO3MW,"I quite liked this one, although he obviously got paid to be in it, I thought Vanilla Ice was a good sport to play the role he did, Neil Patrick Harris did a similar thing making fun of his career demise with the White Castle movie and he of course had the massive career comeback with How I Met Your Mother after that. Be interesting to see if Vanilla's career goes anywhere as a result of this movie.

I thought the younger version of Sandler's character did a good part in his role as well. You seldom see a female teacher character go to jail for doing what she did in a film so I found that refreshing, I can only think of a South Park Episode as the only other place where they've tackled that society double standard with comedy and done it well.

Sandler's role in this was good, although he plays a pretty standard Sandler character, complete with a few immature actions, this film was overall less juvenile than some of his other characters. Which was surprising being what the plot of the film was about.",1418169600,,1015,4.365079365079365

All said, be mindful of what you're looking for. Cheap laughs? Check. A proverbial foot not even attempting to tow the brink of silliness, it occasionally gets a bit old? Check. Some left turns or absolutely lude moments that come awfully - in every sense of the word - close to ruining it all? Well, unfortunately, check. But let your guard down.

Yeah, maybe a few too many cameos (Vanilla Ice, Rex Ryan, Todd Bridges), but other than Ryan, none are bad. The cast is strong with tons of great performances, including hilarious ones by James Caan and Nick Swardson. The two leads? Perfect! And the music is great, especially if you are a child of the 1980s. Don't get me wrong, this movie is not for everybody and is sure to offend, but if you are OK with that, you will be entertained.

Most of what I read was very negative citing some of the themes and ideas used in the movie, as well as saying it just isn't funny.  But I watched it anyway, and I'm glad I did.  I laughed through most of the movie, and will probably have to watch it again just to make sure I didn't miss anything.  I'll try to be more specific now to help you decide if you're like me and would enjoy the movie, or if you're like the negative reviewers.

Spoilers might follow...

The basis of the story is that an early teenage boy has a relationship with one of his teachers that results in a pregnancy.  This is one of the things negative reviewers seem to focus on as making the movie intolerable.  If the idea bothers you... you might want to skip the movie.  But if you're okay with something like this in a work of fiction, and understand that mildly offensive things can result in hilarious bits of humor... you might want to give the movie a shot.  The movie is full of juvenile humor too.  This to me is a good thing.  If you're not real keen on low brow humor, you might want to skip the movie.  If you enjoy Adam Sandler style humor, give the movie a shot.

6589459,5,B009YQO3MW,"That's My Boy is a hard movie to rate.  We're talking about a really *really* immature and highly inappropriate type of comedy.  There's hardly a plot for the most part, other than Adam walking around being a dirty little buffoon and yet, here I am- enjoying it!

The story is that when Adam was a little boy, he found one of his teachers unbelievably attractive and... wow, this is crazy, it turns out the feeling was mutual!  The teacher finds HIM attractive as well!  This means she actually hits on him one day during after school detention, lol.  I was like ""Let me guess, Adam's dreaming this part"" but... NO!  This is really happening!  The hottest teacher ever is actually *doing* him behind the stage curtain in the auditorium!

Well you can probably guess what happens when an adult teacher does *that* to a student... she's sent to jail, and 30 years later Adam Sander is all grown up... and about as clueless as one can possibly be.  It turns out the two of them made a child together, and the child is now approaching 30 years old and about to get married and... guess who crashes the wedding?  Yup, Adam Sandler.  And boy does he crash it in the most hilarious way ever.

Both Adam and his son keep it a secret that the two of them are related, so of course the moments where they almost spill the beans are pretty funny.  The characters throughout this film are really memorable.  The old lady with sexual urges, the strict young man in the ""army"", Adam's shy, but forgiving and likeable son, the son's attractive -but secretly playing two sides- wife, and of course, the obnoxious behavior of Adam Sandler himself.  Everyone's fantastic.

The story centers around Adam's son always ALWAYS finding himself on the wrong end of every situation.  It's like everyone is deliberately making it their own mission to pick on him at every single ripe opportunity, but as fate would have it, they actually love Adam Sandler (well, not always) much to the surprise of his son.

So many memorable segments that it's really hard to pick a highlight.  I think Adam's attraction to the older lady that results in a few disgusting and impossible-to-share sexual situations is easily one of the funniest parts, as is the sexual encounter with a wedding dress and another too-offensive-to-share moment in how the wife was able to detect who did it.  For the most part the storyline focuses around the build-up to the wedding and of course, saves the actual wedding until the very end when, let's just say, several realy dirty secrets are revealed.  Oh and um, let's not forget this part- ""Don't tell mommy about our secret tickle time!  Oooooh GOD!  You actually give it a NAME?!?!""

Overall, I gotta admit I haven't laughed this hard in a while.  The stripper with the big breasts was uh... really nice to see.  I highly recommend this film under one important condition- you find Adam Sandler funny at least a *little* bit.  If you can't stand the guy of course you're going to hate That's My Boy with a passion.

With that said it wasn't Adams Sandlers best movie, but it was far from his worst movie. It wasn't very funny, but it had some funny parts. Instead of calling it very funny I would call it pretty fun. Adam Sandler has this thing where to make a good movie he has to also make a crappy movie, but then he has his inbetween movie that don't require a crappy movie to counteract them.

Happy Gilmore, Waterboy, Anger Management, Click, Just Go With It.

Funniest movie I've seen since Pineapple Express, one of the few Apatow movies that isn't watered down ""mature"" movies for ""adults"" and/or babies. Adam Sandler's character is really good. You may not understand this, reviewers/critics/current movie watchers/Hollywood snobs but a character like Sandler's is MUCH HARDER TO PULL OFF THAN A CARDBOARD-THIN APATOW CHARACTER. In Apatow world everyone feels safe and warm, no risks are taken and a little ""raunchy"" dialogue is inserted to appease guys dragged to the boring proverbial Snoozefest. This Sandler movie, however, is the real-deal kind of comedy movie where you just laugh your a@@ off. I could not stop laughing for the life of me, and it felt really good to laugh again at a movie. No caveats were made so that no one felt uncomfortable, it was just balls to the wall, straight up comedy. We definitely need more movies like That's My Boy.

Samberg was at times kind of bad but such a strong cast of misfits he kind of fits in, so I forgive him and look forward to more movie with him. Andy's choice of movies to me is astonishing since he's supposed to turn into a creme de la creme Hollywood star after being internet famous on SNL. Instead he has the balls to do a movie that's probably funnier cumulatively than OLD SCHOOL. I mean, I like Will Ferrell, it's just, his movies now are horrible. Samberg's got a ways, a long ways to go to be on Will Ferrells level, but such a risky, honest choice for a kind of debut movie. Hey, Sandler's first movie was horrible too, something to do with a boat and chicks, I've never seen it. So, kudos! You slate has been wiped clean! [this is samberg's second movie, I think]

6589480,5,B009YQO3MW,I loved this movie so much I watched it twice in two days! Super funny story about a man (Adam Sandler) who has an innapropriate relationship with his teacher and gets her pregnant and they have a son. She goes to jail so he is left to raise the son on his own. Since he is a child himself he doesn't do a great job as a parent and son and father lose touch soon after the son turns 18.  The movie is about them reconnecting later in life.,1364169600,,439,3.932584269662921

6589485,3,B009YQO3MW,"""That's My Boy"" is typical Adam Sandler...he has a formula and sticks with it, even when the plots differ.  Same co-stars, but this one has only Nick Swardson...no Rob Schneider though...in a way, this is like comfort food...BUT the plot felt a bit fresher and the new co-stars and cameos raise the bar a bit.

I found the premise kinda funny in spite of his tastelessness...13 y.o. obnoxious teen Donny Berger knocks up his 7th grade teacher, becomes an overnight star, then washed up & broke 25 years later...typical for many child actors, and his kid escaped...Sandler's character was a bad dad...but he wants to make it up to his kid Han Solo (all grown up and played by Andy Samberg) when he found out he was getting married and changed his name.

He visits Han unexpectedly and all hell breaks loose...surprise fun cameo and side roles appear, from Leighton Meester to Tony Orlando to Vanilla Ice to James Caan (no surprise as JC was mentioned in Adam's ""Chanukah Song"") to his kids as the lemonade stand girls...many times, these cameo roles are better than the main ones.  But two that made total sense was Eva Amurri as the teacher (she was sexy/smoking...if she was my teacher in 7th grade, I'd have had the hots for her too...I totally 100% admit), and 25 years later in prison, the role was played by her famous mother, Susan Sarandon...they totally look alike...

One major letdown was too much Van Halen on the soundtrack (and young Donnie loved them...tickets to their gig)...I passionately hate that band!!  I know teenage boys loved them in the 80s...but I was not one of them, and when at least 3 VH songs came on, I utterly cringed...otherwise, I actually enjoyed the flick against my better judgement...and at least one pivotal moment was just too gross to explain, nor do I wish to spoil the surprise of it, and it had a happy ending, so that was nice.

In the end, if you love Adam Sandler's work, you will enjoy this flick...",1362960000,,1948,4.645348837209302

6589498,4,B009YQO3MW,"Occasionally Adam Sandler channels his inner demons and goes back to his roots to make an unbelievably funny movie. Based on his recent track record, it's sometimes hard to remember, but when Adam Sandler is on, he is one of the funniest people alive, and That's My Boy is a prime example of it. This is hands down the funniest Sandler film I've seen in the last 10 years. The story follows a 13 year old boy, who becomes a national celebrity, after he knocks up his 7th grade teacher. Fast forward 20 years and that boy is a has-been, and his son is off the radar, but that's all about to change when dad sees a wedding notice in the newspaper. The movie isn't just funny, it's actually a pretty good story, and the cameos are amazing. I'm certainly not going to give anything away, but even if you're not a huge Sandler fan, the movie is worth watching just for the unbelievable cameos, by people I haven't seen in years. I went in hoping to see a classic Sandler movie and was not disappointed, this is one of the funniest movies of the year and you shouldn't miss it!",1361491200,,1071,4.333333333333333

6589533,3,B009YQO3MW,"The story is Interesting. Really, for a Romantic Comedy. I mean if I would choose any word to describe this movie with I would pick ""Taboo"". It really does tackle issues that are considered abnormal in today's society and unexpected which makes the plot stand out from your average Comedy films You Know. For Example: Danny as a 13 year old has an affair with his insanely attractive Math teacher who's probably in her mid to late 20s and ought been married by now but instead of dating her boss or colleagues decides to pick her minor student as her lover as well as her sex partner and of course a 13 year old kid won't show any protests to that, ultimately they get caught in the act in front of the entire school, predictably enough the teacher gets sent to jail as a punishment for her crime but the twist here is that neither parties show any remorse, the movie makes the situation seems honest soo honest in fact it comes off as ""What? Really?"" I mean in real life if a teacher gets caught sleeping with her high school student she'll most likely cry and wimper and the kid will be sent to a psychiatrist for being traumatized because he's been god forbid sexually abused all his life. But in the story Danny goes on to lead a happy, fame filled life, perfectly normal and his teacher not only gets sent to jail but the product of their love is a baby that Danny raises to be a grown man who's so unappreciative towards his father that he runs away at the age of 18 and goes on to being successful while his father lives as a washed up celebrity with so much debt on his credit that he will go to jail if he doesn't pay it off. So the solution to all his problems is either go to jail or ask help from his estranged son who masked his identity completely and doesn't want anything to do with his biological father so Donny has to get introduced to his son's fiancee, boss, future in laws etc.. without any of them knowing that he's the father.

OK, as a comedy the sense of humor doesn't really fit in with the rest. It's more of a dark humor but the dialogue is weak it wasn't sophisticated like most movies of the same genre so I'll give that a pass. The story itself is a cookie cutter in the end, yes it has twists and turns all over but the ending is as usual predictable. I liked the message that the producers tried to send across mostly it's a message about the importance of having a family in our lives and it also depicts a beautiful though hugely inappropriate by today's standards love story between 13 year old Donny and his Teacher. But the bigger picture is just simply love. I love those type of films that are heartwarming and engaging at the same time. I would've liked it if the dialogue was just a tad more witty and the jokes weren't all that funny especially those with potty humor but they weren't many so it's fine.

This is probably the best Adam Sandler has starred in a very long time, his movies the last couple of years were just horrifying and extremely boring dare I mention the Grown Ups? UGH! So, yeah what saved this from being a total wreck for me is the twisted story I'm kinda drawn to the sins of human nature if you know what I mean so for that I'll give it a 3 stars because in my opinion Comedies in general nowadays hardly deserve anything above 4 unless they were extremely spectacular.

Just watch it and see for yourself, not the best movie out there but it's fun for fun times I mean me and My boyfriend watched this just to waste time and I think if you're looking for something entertaining but light then this movie should do.",1358035200,,3583,4.289512555391433

Lots of jokes and great songs from that era.  Some of the humor is border line crude and sexual so I wouldn't say this is a family movie but more 18+.,1357430400,,292,3.619047619047619

6589642,1,B009YQO3MW,"I'm disappointed by Andy Samberg.  He was great in Hot Rod and Lonely Island with all those great songs but why did he think this was a good one.  The fact is that Adam Sander hasn't been funny since Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison.  He's obviously doing it for the money now.  People follow this work because they see him as the old funny Adam. Well that's clearly my opinion but I feel strongly about it.  The worst part about this money is that fact that Adam's character was this complete idiot but instead of others being appalled by him, they actually love him.  In a normal funny movie that would not happen tell the end, when the stupid character changes or shows them a good side to them.",1355788800,,697,4.364341085271318
6589643,5,B009YQO3MW,"I love smart comedies, but I also love raunchy, toilet humor, which this had PLENTY of. I don't understand what people were looking for here. Sandler plays a pathetic, oversexed, down-on-his-luck idiot, which doesn't improve over the course of the film. Besides, after the last few Sandler films, even though I did like ""Click"", he redeems himself as a nasty comedy actor/writer. I've been waiting for Adam to make a movie like this...I thought he may have been headed in the ""Eddie Murphy"" direction of a string of ""PG"" kids movies.

I usually complain about movies starting funny, then kind of tapering off in the middle, but I laughed through this from start to finish. I may be 54 years old, but I work in a ""Shop"" invironment, and hear twisted raunchy humor all day, and what's funny, is funny. This movie is just that. No, the story isn't ""Good Will Hunting"" quality, but any movie that can make me laugh for 2 hours wins my vote for 5 stars.

In case you haven't seen the movie and plan on seeing it, spare the frustration of trying to figure out just who plays ""Han Solo's"" boss... It's Tony Orlando (if any of you even know who he is) and he's actually pretty funny.

If movies with potty humor make you cringe, STAY AWAY and watch ""UP"" or ""The Lion King"" again...but if you like jokes about body parts and bodily functions, you should see this.",1355788800,,1354,4.518367346938776

The glory days of Big Daddy and Happy Gilmore are over, and I've made peace with that, but it would appear now that Adam Sandler is just shelling out whatever crap production companies are willing to let him make. Aside from it being categorically unfunny... whoever was their military liason needs to be fired, never to be hired again. The brother, who was supposed to be a Marine but was wearing Army uniforms mashed up with Marine uniforms, the wrong rank, using the wrong slang and vernacular made it like nails on a chalkboard for me. As an actual Marine, it was enfuriating. If you're going to have a military character, at least TRY to get the uniform right. At one point he was wearing a pair of dress blues pants with blood stripe, with an Army blouse. Some of you probably didn't notice it, and that's fine - but the point is, this movie was doomed to suck, and their shoddy filmmaking made it worse. Way to go, Sandler.

6589693,3,B009YQO3MW,"Happy Madison Films is back with a new outrageous, moronically funny film titled ""That's My Boy"".  Directed by writer/filmmaker Sean Anders (""Hot Tub Time Machine"", ""She's Out of My League"", ""Sex Drive"") and written by David Caspe (""Happy Endings"").

Starring Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg with many guest appearances from popular TV and music stars (from the '80s to present time) and well-known sports figures, ""That's My Boy"" would receive the reputation of being his most offensive film (and some critics will call it his worst) to date.

The film begins with a  young 14-year-old teen named Donny Berger (portrayed by Justin Weaver) who has sworn off girls and has only eyes for his 22-year-old teacher Mary McGarricle (portrayed by Eva Amurri Martino, daughter of Susan Sarandon).

Donny tries to attract his teacher with Van Halen tickets but disgusted that her student would hit on her, she gives him detention.  While in detention, Ms. McGarricle confesses to Donny that she has the hots for him and she takes him to her office and has sex with him.

The student and teacher then continue to have a sexual relationship and during graduation, the two are having sex again, in which everyone can hear them.  When the curtains are opened, to the adult teachers, they are shocked to find Ms. McGarricle having improper relations with her student, while the students give Donny a standing ovation.

Ms. McGarricle is charged with statutory rape and is pregnant with Donny's child.  Because she has no remorse of what she had done, she is sentence to 30-years in prison.  Donny has been given custody of the child after its birth and raise his son on his own.

And life for Donny throughout the '80s and '90s has earned him amazing fame as the teen who had sex with his teacher.  Making him a wealthy man but also a bad father.

Fastfoward to the present and we learn that Donny has wasted all his money and to make things worse, he has not paid any taxes to the IRS and must come up with over $40,000 or else he will be serving time in prison.  So, immediately, Donny must find a way to get that money.

His manager Jim Nance (portrayed by NY Jets Coach Rex Ryan) tells him to contact his son.  But Donny said he has not heard from his overweight son Han Solo for years.

Meanwhile, we see Han Solo (portrayed by Andy Samberg), who has now gone by the name of Todd, not overweight and doing quite well financially.  He is engaged to a woman named Jamie (portrayed by Leighton Meester) and both are busy planning for their upcoming wedding.

While visiting his favorite strip club and telling his woes to stripper Champale (portrayed by Luenell).  Her daughter Brie (portrayed by Ciara) brings a publication that shows Todd and Jamie getting married and now Donny has come up with an idea.

Donny goes to producer Randall Morgan (portrayed by Dan Patrick) with a show angle of what if he can reunite himself , his son and his mother Mary (present version portrayed by Susan Sarandon) for an upcoming reality special.  And if he does, he'll receive the money to prevent him from going to prison.

At the wedding site, Todd meets his future in-laws Gerald (portrayed by Blake Clark) and Helen (portrayed by Meagen Fay), grandma Delores (portrayed by Peggy Stewart), the soldier and Jamie's overprotective brother Chad (portrayed by Milo Ventimiglia).  But also hoping that he gets promoted for a significant job owned by Steve Spirou (portrayed by Tony Orlando).

As everyone is getting prepared and discussing the wedding, Donny shows up to meet with his son but shocked that his father would make an appearance, Donny concocts a scheme that he is Todd's best friend because he saved his life (as Todd nearly died trying to pick up a burrito he dropped near an incoming train).

As the family welcomes Donny's presence for the wedding, Jamie is shocked that Todd would know someone who looks like someone from the trailer park.

When Donny and his son have alone time, we learn that Donny was not a good father for his son.  Giving him ice cream and candy, it led to his son being overweight and always making fun of his son, to the point that he permanently had a ""New Kids on the Block"" tattoo done on his son's back.

While Donny does not welcome his father being there, Donny who was there trying to find a way to get money, starts to find himself wanting to bond with his son and actually show that he cares for him.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When it comes to Happy Madison films, especially ones to star Adam Sandler, you tend to expect to see ridiculous and moronic comedy.  And most of the time, critics despise the films but yet, the films attract an audience who wants to see outrageous comedy and to see how far Adam Sandler will go.

""That's My Boy"" is a film in which Adam Sandler takes things very far, to the point he knows that the film will offend people, but also tries to showcase a lot of talent via guest cameos.

If you are a viewer who is easily offended, this film is not for you.  The film tries to use a comedic portrayal of pedophilia, incest and statutory rape and many people are not going to be thrilled with what they see in this film.  While those who are used to moronic comedy and enjoy how outrageous these films will go, will find it hilarious (or just plain out dumb).

For example, as a viewer, there are scenes to show that Donny is a man that is well-endowed and we see that he is often needing to relieve himself by masturbation or having sex with someone.  So, in one scene, he uses an old photo of Jamie's grandmother.  The following morning, the grandmother sees sticky tissues all over the place and his son tries to clean up the mess while the tissues are all stuck to his hand.

Another example is Donny doing the popular Budweiser catchphrase from the '90s ""Whazzap"" and everyone hoping it would be used again, start repeating it.

Or the guest appearances of Vanilla Ice, a person like Donny who splurged all his money during his fame and is now upset with Donny for having sex with his mother.  Or Todd Bridges, a former drug addict who has white powder on his nose constantly.  And possibly the most visible scene features actress Luenell as a stripper with her boobs hanging out with pasties and dancing on a poll.

There are a lot of those ""I can't believe they are doing this!"" type of moments throughout the film and many thrown in for comedic shock factor.  As well as a film that showcases a good number of celebrity cameos to make it a bit more entertaining.

""That's My Boy"" is nowhere close to being one of the better Happy Madison, let alone Adam Sandler films out there.  It's moronically funny and entertaining in a Happy Madison sense but other than that.  People used to this humor will have no problem being entertained but those who know they will be offended, should stay away from this film.

I'm not quick to pan Happy Madison films.  They have their niche audience and fans know that they can get something crazy or something so moronic, that they enjoy these films.  And the fact that I review them often and defend them, goes to show that even I have a soft spot in my heart for moronic, juvenile humor and I'm not easily offended by these comedy films.

Yes, this film was controversial and is considered as Adam Sandler's most offensive film yet.  But for those who are used to Happy Madison/Adam Sandler films, you know what kind of film you're going to get.  And if you love moronic comedy and wanting to see how far Adam Sandler can push the button, let alone a film featuring so many guest cameos, ""That's My Boy"" may be a comedy film that will interest you!",1354320000,,9174,4.621137206427688

6589707,1,B009YQO3MW,"I'd like to know what happened to Adam Sandler.  He used to be funny.  While I'm not a huge fan of his, I love Happy Gilmore and the Wedding Singer.  I loved his dramatic turns in Punch Drunk Love, and the oft dismissed Spanglish.  Even the anemic family film Bedtime Stories is OK.  But then he churned out movies like Jack and Jill.  And then her churned out this.  I wouldn't normaly waste time in reviewing such tripe, but I felt I had to vent.  I had to warn people about this bile of a film.  ""That's My Boy"" in its near two hour running time is the most unfunny, offensive, mean spirited film I have seen.  And I've seen some pretty bad films.  The words and images that appeared on my TV screen just made my jaw drop.  The fact that the likes of Sandler, Andy Samburg, James Caan, and Susan Sarandon grace this garbage is enough to make you shake your head after watching it.

I honestly don't know where to begin.  The premise involves Sandler's character, as a child, having a child with his teacher.  The teacher is subsequently locked up while the child grows up to be Andy Sammberg and Sandler as his neglegent ""manchild"" father.  Sandler becomes something of a c list celebrity, capitializing on his 15 minutes of fame as a victim of underage sex with an adult.  So if that's the type of thing you find funny, this movie is for you.

The movie then offers a series of gags involving incest, vomit, urination, old people saying and doing dirty things, and a cringeworthy gag involving ""wassssuppp."" It was vulgar joke after vulgar joke. The only thing I found mildly amusing is the friendship Sandler's character has with Vanilla Ice, but that's about it.  And Andy Samberg, who has his moments on SNL and can be incredibly funny, is wasted here with the material.  Sarandon and Caan are really wasted here and are almost certainly cashing a paycheck.

 I once liked Sandler, but this movie scrapes the bottom of the barrel of r-rated humor.  It seems Sandler's reaching to make edgier comedy in a post Appatow world, but he's not Judd Appatow.  I like the occaisonal dirty joke - if it's funny and clever.  Sandler does neither here.",1353801600,15,2147,4.514285714285714
6589708,2,B009YQO3MW,I expected a lot more out of these two but overall it was pretty bad film. Hope to see Sandberg it better roles and films in the future.,1353801600,,136,3.892857142857143

6589710,1,B009YQO3MW,I wish I could give negative stars.  This movie was a waste of time and brain cells!  Don't waste your time or money!,1353715200,,117,4.043478260869565
6589711,1,B009YQO3MW,"Imagine, if you will, a desolate wasteland. It's inhabitants from an earlier time would have called it Earth, even home. But now it is only the battleground for mankind's war against itself. You are alone, with your child, your very pride and joy, as you scrounge for supplies. Suddenly, he's snatched up and taken from you. You try to go after this assailant, but he's too fast. You are alone in an apocalyptic hell-world with the one person you love most being taken from you and dragged to an unknown fate.

This was the happy-place I went to after watching the first 20 minutes of That's My Boy.

It's not that I'm some sort of depressed psycho, quite the contrary. However, That's My Boy was so devoid of any enjoyable qualities that my very ability to IMAGINE happiness was sucked from me, and the only escape I had was to become the dad in The Road.

Packed with gut-wrenchingly horrible attempts at comedy (I think), and OH BOY CAMEOS FROM THIRD-RATE CELEBRITIES (Remember Vanilla Ice? Me neither), That's My Boy is the kind of film that really makes people appreciate the finer things in life, like Nanking and Gili. It's a film that I imagine Adam Sandler's family just pretended they never knew came out. It's quite literally the worst thing I've ever seen, and like I said, I saw Gili.

I guess, if I had to, I'd recommend it to masochists and interrogators at Guantanamo Bay.

To summarize, That's My Boy is another emotionally destructive deuce Adam Sandler has laid upon the unsuspecting public, that makes me wonder: ""What pictures does Adam Sandler have that SOMEBODY doesn't want to get out?""",1353715200,2,1610,4.695035460992908

If you've been on the fence about watching this movie and are a fan of Sandler, I darn near guarantee you'll grab your laptop half way through this movie to check email or Facebook because you are just barely paying attention and waiting to laugh.

This is one of those comedies that tries to have a soul (ala Just Go With It) but is unfortunately written so flat that the ""soul"" doesn't carry it and you just sit around waiting to laugh and it doesn't happen.",1352678400,4,746,4.283687943262412

I don't know why people rate this harshly but personally I loved the movie and definitely think that its worth the blu-ray buy. The movie is actually really long but keeps me laughing throughout the film.  The ending is pretty shockingly disgusting but hilarious none the less! I say give it a try! It definitely is one of those love it or hate it films. Awesome thing about the movie is the fact that he brings back old actors from his previous films and includes them some how. So if you like the previous Adam Sandler movies with all of those wacky actors then you should like this movie.  Shipping was pretty fast and the movie played flawlessly.

6589773,1,B009YQO3MW,". . . for ordering this movie.  I should have known better.  I keep thinking that I am going to get at least some good laughs out of a Sandler movie like I did from a couple of his earlier ones- like ""Happy Gilmore"" or ""The Wedding Singer"" but they actually keep getting worse and worse.  I thought he hit a new low with ""Grown Ups"" but ""That's my Boy"" surpasses it in awfulness as it adds to the ad hoc nature and feel of Sandler screen plays by being extremely and totally gratuitously vulgar and obscene.  I have to wonder if the script to this mess was made up as they went along.  This is a long film as well for a comedy.  It never seems to end.

Sandler plays a washed up 80's lower class celeb icon who impregnated his junior high teacher and who, after many years of separation from his son, goes to find him on his son's wedding weekend so he can ask for money to pay off his tax debt or else go to prison.  His character is not funny or lovable - just a crass boring loudmouthed cretin whom we are supposed to believe everyone in the movie just loves for some reason- I guess because he is ""real"".  He isn't.  He is a sad caricature of a ""Masshole"" and as someone from Massachusetts- I found this movie to be insulting just on that level alone.  There is literally nothing to like about this character- but everyone in the film just loves him for no reason.  Every scene is a setup for some unfunny vulgar gag.  This movie actually got painful to watch.  I wanted to turn it off- but sorta like rubbernecking when you pass a car crash on the highway- I kept watching it until the bitter dumb predictable end.

At one time Sandler had something.  But even his best movies were never great movies.  But now- it's like he just churns out this garbage for some assured expected lowest return.  This movie actually feels like they got a movie set- a nice beach front house- and then just decided to make up a movie on the fly as they vacationed there.  It's an insult.  A bad movie- made in bad faith.  I won't make the mistake again of getting one of his films via pay per view.  As for going to a theater to see a Sandler pic?  Please.  Never did that to begin with.",1352332800,2,2174,4.183132530120482

6589779,3,B009YQO3MW,"Although Adam Sandler's 'Jack and Jill' got a walloping from the critics, I really liked it. Sandler was going more the slapstick route rather than the working class hero theme and cynicism of 'Deeds' and 'Happy Gilmour'. He followed it up with the feel-good 'Thats my boy', a movie so silly and funny.

But while I really enjoy the movie, it seems the powers-that-be behind the comedy movies these days are more about fighting traditions and being vulgar, in a kind of 'groundbreaking' (huh!) way. It's as if this movie is obsessed with being as vulgar as it can. Sometimes it's funny, sometimes off-putting.

The other thing I've noticed, especially with Sandler movies, is that they tend to portray any straight and narrow middle class person as internally twisted. There's a character called 'Phil' who keeps psychotically talking about how he's only ever 'been' with his wife, before going on a spree at a strip-club. There's also a businessman in it, who actually seems kind of nice but at the end he's exposed as some cheating, exploitative creep.

But if you're a lazy, booze addicted, loud-mouthed hack, like 'Donny Burger', or a pop star from 20 years ago, like Vanilla Ice, then, wallah! you're one of the good guys. You know how to live, you know how to enjoy yourself, but you're good at heart.

Anyway, it's one of Sandlers funniest films, I really enjoyed it, except for those points above. I could probably give it a 7.",1352160000,,1435,4.774193548387097

6589804,2,B009YQO3MW,"I just got done watching this and I must say it felt pretty underwhelming. The whole story of a jr. high/high school kid having sex with a teacher and getting her pregnant had a lot of potential, but the end result was just very ""meh."" A lot of big reviewers found the topic to be vulgar, but it could've turned out to be a pretty good comedy. Sadly, I didn't get much more than a few chuckles here and there.

Lately Sandler's movies in general have been very bland and feel almost forced. The last one I really enjoyed was ""Grown Ups."" After that they were all pretty average. I wanted to like Sandler's character here, but I couldn't. Between his weird accent and the way he acted it was just a turnoff. Samberg isn't much better either. Once again I wanted to like his character, but he just feels very awkward and almost uncomfortable when you see him in a scene.

I have to admit that, even though I feel guilty because of it, most of my laughs came from the scenes with Vanilla Ice. I don't know what it was but almost every scene he was in I let out a chuckle. I'm not saying he's an A+ actor and I'm not really looking forward to seeing him in any future films, but he wasn't bad here. The rest of the supporting cast was decent. However, it was nice to see Will Forte, Susan Sarandon, Blake Clark, Nick Swardson and James Caan.

Towards the end I felt like the movie was trying too hard to stretch out the length. It tried to close up on a mature note with dad saving the day and reuniting, but it wasn't very convincing. On top of it most of the plot twists were pretty generic and felt kind of expected. Except the whole sister-brother thing. Wasn't expecting that.

6589822,5,B009YQO3MW,We watched this movie and it was hysterical. We are big Adam Sandler fans. There was only one movie of his that we did not like and that was punch drunk love. This movie did not disappoint from beginging to end we were laughing out of our seats.,1351036800,2,245,4.125
6589823,5,B009YQO3MW,"This movie really excelled on all fronts for me.  It reminded me of the good old days where Adam Sandler aimed to be funny and really get some inspiring humor and quotes that, be it as may, you will continue to say for years to come.  I still say ""Scuba Steve, Damn You!"" whenever I stub my toe.

  This movie excels with it's hilarious, but believable storyline.  An excellent cast, superb musical score, appealing visuals and well-timed humor bring the laughs out of you.

  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants or needs a laugh.  If you don't laugh while watching this movie, you have got to be comatose!

6589826,1,B009YQO3MW,"I usually find Adam Sandler pretty funny but this movie was completely disgusting. The language was just too much, completely inappropriate and gross. In addition to the whole thing not even being filmed to seem realistic. I can honestly say that there wasn't a single scene that I genuinely enjoyed. This is completely trashy garbage.

6589829,4,B009YQO3MW,First off I'm not a huge Adam Sandler fan but when I saw the trailer something told me this isn't going to be that bad as some of his other movies.  And I was right!  If you like Step Brothers or 21 Jump Street then this type of humor is up your alley. Funny from start to finish!  The great cameos (Vanilla Ice) and raunchy humor make this movie a great watch!!  Give it a shot and I dare you to try not to laugh at all.,1350691200,4,421,3.8045977011494254

6589831,1,B009YQO3MW,"Where do I start? This movie is so stupid it makes you wonder do they know what real comdey is?! This isn't funny in the least. It uses the F- word throughout like water. I have a few f words myself for this turkey. Flop, Foolish, Failure of a dumb movie. What was also upsetting is that they had a 3 or 4 yearold holding himself in the movie. I never been a fan of Adam Sandlers and after watching this garbage I don't think I will ever be. Do actors or actress read scripts before taking a role or they just desparte. I got to see this movie for free and I want my money back that should tell you something. Don't ever buy this trash of a movie unless you feel like you been bad and you need to be punished.",1350691200,4,709,3.965034965034965
6589832,1,B009YQO3MW,Haven't ever  been a Adam Sandler fan. Only have found one of his movies to be funny.  This was a new low for him. Discussing and not funny.... Don't waste your time!!,1350691200,4,167,4.1875
6589833,3,B009YQO3MW,"After Sandler's last couple of movies, I was losing all faith that Sandler still had it. Jack & Jill looked like Sandler was scraping the very bottom of the barrel of old SNL skit characters to make into a movie. When seeing the trailer for this movie, I thought Sandler had hit rock bottom and this movie was going to be the nail in the coffin for his cinematic releases in future.

How wrong I was! I was going to dismiss this movie and not even bother to check it out, but a friend who doesn't laugh at much at all recommended it saying it was hilarious. So we checked it out, and now I am glad I did not pass on this one. Even tho Sandler's character didn't seem real and fairly badly acted, like a drunken Billy Madison, it was still an enjoyable movie in the end.

Sandler plays a has been celebrity who reached fame as a child by impregnating his teacher in the 8th grade? She went to jail, but he became a celebrity... but over the years, he faded out of the spotlight and had now become a broke down slob who owes about forty thousand dollars in back taxes. He goes to what few friends he has left in show business and asks to borrow money, but none will give it to him. He then makes an offer to a producer about earning $50,000 for a reunion show with him and his teacher in prison, who I think is now his wife? But the producer says instead, how about a reunion show with you, your wife and your son.

The son left Sandlers character when he was 18 to have nothing to do with him ever again. His son however is getting married soon and Sandler seeks him and his new in-laws out to talk his son into doing the show. However, upon arrival, the son has told his in-laws his parents are dead, so Sandler steps in and pretends to be his sons best friend and makes up ridicules stories about how they met. Now his father is his sons best man, not by the sons choice and you can get the drift of where it goes from there as the son doesn't want anyone to know that guy is his dad. Then of coarse, the usual Happy Madison plot takes place where Sandler screws up something, and redeems himself by the end.

The humor of this movie is not kid humor, a lot of it is adult humor and almost blue in some areas, and that's how I like it! I didn't expect this movie to be this dirty or for that matter, be funny at all, but it was... to me anyway. Sandlers side kick celebrity new comer side kick is Vanilla Ice, and I think there is a few other appearances by people who where big in the 80's early 90's and have since gone into the ""where are they now"" unemployment line. Ice doesn't mind making fun of himself, so his role was enjoyable to watch.

A lot of WTF moments and sick humor, so if you like that, definitely give this movie a rent and see how it sits with you.",1350604800,,2770,4.093922651933702
6589834,4,B009YQO3MW,"If you are a fan of old school Adam Sandler, then you will love this film!  Ever since such Adam Sandler classics as Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Little Nicky, where crude humor and immature satire ruled the day, the die-hard Sandler fans have been waiting for this film...and it delivers!

This film is definitely NOT for the easily offended.  It truly is Adam Sandler at his best!  If you have a morbid sense of humor and love toilet humor, like I do, then this is right up your alley!

With a top notch cast, and hilarious situations, fans are going to be rolling on the floor laughing...seriously!  There are some funny moments in this film that come unexpectedly, and they succeed.  My own 77 year old mom was with me to see this in the theater and even she was laughing.

I highly recommend this film...and I had the HONOR of being cast as a background extra.  I am the tall blonde female standing behind Adam Sandler in the first 15 minutes in the film when he is at The Randall Morgan Show speaking to the recetpionist, played by none other than Erin Andrews, right before his confrontation with Vanilla Ice.  Adam is a great guy, very cool, and very down to earth.",1350604800,2,1178,4.462616822429907
6589835,5,B009YQO3MW,"I loved this movie!  My favorite Adam Sandler movie since ""The Wedding Singer"".  I think this is probably his funniest movie of all time though.

Andy Samberg was awesome too.  They should do more movies together.

Probably two of my favorite people to come out of SNL.

That's My Boy is one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen. There is not a single weak moment.

This is also one of Leighton Meester's best performances.  It reminds me of her earliest film ""Drive-Thru"", she definitely seems best playing comedic roles.

Milo Ventimaglia was awesome too.  I like him a lot more as a character actor than when he plays leading roles like in stuff like ""Heroes"" or ""The Gilmore Girls"".

Awesome movie all around with one of the best soundtracks ever!",1350604800,2,763,4.661654135338346
