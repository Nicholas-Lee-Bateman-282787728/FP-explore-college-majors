8138729,1,B000HD1P0Y,"Bought this DVD for my grand-daughter who is just beginning to play.  She was concerned about her schools upcoming tryouts wanting to know what the game was about and so not make any mistakes.  Yes, it did show the basic hits, but lacked any detail on the layout of the court, the placement of the players, the rules of the game, the things a beginner needs to know just to walk onto the court, etc..  I went on-line and printed out a diagram of the court and the rules of the game.  I showed her where the players were placed, the rotation of players and discussed the rules.  All of which could have easily worked into and fit on this short DVD.",1324684800,,647,4.270491803278689
