1879099,5,B000094J7K,"Timequest shows what the world would have possibly been like had President John F.Kennedy had not been assassinated. There is a time-traveler who warns President Kennedy that he will be killed in Dallas within a few hours which changes the course of history. This amazing political fiction is based on speculation & facts. Due to lack of a largely known cast,this film was overlooked yet surpasses many high-budget science fiction thrillers. This is a great movie. Most Republicans wouldn't like it as it confirms their worst nightmares of what may have happened had President Kennedy & his brother Robert Kennedy continued in office. Vietnam ended before it could begin,etc.
The actor who played the father on ""The Waltons"" as the time traveler. This is terrific science fiction. This movie is for anyone who enjoys the an excellent portrayal of ""what if JFK had not been assassinated ?"".  The time travel & paradoxes that time travel & the changes in one thing that causes many changes is an amazing display of creativity by the writer. This is a must-see.",1061337600,18,1058,4.943820224719101

How many times have you ever thought What if...?  This film portrays what may have occured if President Kennedy was not assassinated in Dallas in 1963.  Hints at how this nation's history may have changed from sending a man to the moon and the Vietnam war.  Mixes real facts with a portrayal of what could have occurred.
I came away from this film thinking that if only events had occured as was portrayed, perhaps we would be better off than we are now with the threat of nuclear war, clandestine operations of goverment organizations, and a program which remains stagnant due to political involvement and constant budget cuts.

1879106,4,B000094J7K,"As another reviewer stated, I picked this movie up on whim, as I needed 15 DVD's for the 15 for $20 deal.

The actors were familiar, but the idea was very interesting.  I've read ""WHAT IF"" books and found them entertaining.  I think that all of us will agree, that the ""reality"" of the US space program, well, it fell flat on it's face since the Moon, for those of us that wish more had been done.

The notion, that by JFK's ""natural"" death in 2001, the world had a colony on the moon was refreshing.  Looking at other science fiction, everyone portrayed that space travel would be much more advanced then it currently is (ie 2001 and 2010 movies).  Also, look at the 1960's Star Trek (ie Kahn's sleeper ship, etc).  The hint that the CIA had it's hand in the assassination attempt, LBJ's industrial complex and Vietnam.  The line of 57,000 American military would be saved....

The premise that the Kennedy's from that day on, would own their lives to a man who was not born, but took it onto himself to change the coarse of not only their lives, but the coarse of the country.  He assumed a lot, but the new ""reality"" that came from JFK's and RFK's survival would have been interesting.  The time traveler, Mr Mead, was obviously much, much older, maybe in his 70's himself when he made the trip back.

I enjoyed it for what it was.  I would have liked the special affects to be a bit better, but I know that costs $$$.  It takes a bit to follow the back and forth between different times, but not hard (as stated, temporal paradoxes don't bother me).

I give the story a 4.5/5, the acting 3.5/5, over all, a 4/5....",1376006400,,1618,4.364548494983278
1879107,4,B000094J7K,"I have seen this MOVIE quite a few times as a MOVIE about time travel of any sort intrigues me. One time travel MOVIE differs from another, some have been better, some have been worse but TimeQuest, as a MOVIE about the ""What if"" scenario, works incredibly well.
It jumps around and that may be confusing to some, as if a MOVIE like this isn't confusing enough to follow as it is where time travel is concerned.
But make no mistake, this MOVIE is very well done and the only one made that satisfies that question of ""What if JFK had not been assassinated on Nov. 22nd, 1963?"".
I especially like the part of the MOVIE where Oliver Stone is plugging his new MOVIE, ""11/22/63"" but it's not about the assassination of JFK and I'll leave it at that for you to find out for yourselves.
Is TimeQuest worth a view?, absolutely, it's in my DVD Collection, so I'd say so.
Now, for the answer to the question of my cap locks being stuck on MOVIE throughout my review.....because that's what it is, A MOVIE, my problem is with some of you guys is you have to put your political swing into your review about this MOVIE.
Why can't you leave your political views out of it and just review it for what it is...A MOVIE!
But if it'll make you political pendants happy, here's my review of it politically..............
JFK was a Democrat and I liked him and respected him as a President, one of the two best Presidents in my lifetime, Reagan was the other.",1374710400,,1437,4.385767790262173
1879108,5,B000094J7K,"Interesting take on time travel, which I am always interested in. A lot of it is opinion and speculation, but that's this person's take. As I watched the movie, I couldn't help thinking of some similarities in this and a recent book 11-23-63, by Stephen King, and Time Quest, which came out in 2000. The biggest flaw for me, in both, was that they implicated Lee Harvey Oswald, which I don't believe. 11-23-63 was definitely science FICTION, because no man who ever lived, could have made those shots with that precision, especially Mr. Oswald who was a mediocre shot, at best. At least the Time Quest movie implied a conspiracy, which is more likely. If Mr. Oswald had been involved in any way, there would not have been any reason to kill him publicly. American justice? No. Texas justice? Most likely. I wouldn't say the country would be better off if Kennedys (both JFK & RFK) had lived, but this country became an oligarchy on 11-23-63. The movie isn't as complicated or detailed as the King novel, but the movie could give a writer some ideas for a novel about the same situation.",1341705600,,1086,4.632124352331606

1879110,4,B000094J7K,"The movie asks the question, ""What would of happened if the Kennedy brothers didn't get assassinated?"" It then answers it in the most hokey and corny fashion. Now I am a big Kennedy lover, but it was really ignorant to believe the whole world would be coming up roses. The plot includes a private chat to the Kennedy men about their affairs. The man who time travels to save their lives has to sacrifice his, so the Kennedy boys makes sure they figure out who this guy was (as he was a child at this time in history) and he gets rewarded, because those Kenndys always look after their own and those who help them.

The movie is amusing and somewhat enjoyable even though it had my stomach churning at times. The plot premise is interesting which is why the movie is popular in a sub-culture way. The actual plot, acting, and dialouge is of the bad indie variety which is why the movie is less popular than what you would expect.",1310256000,,928,4.395348837209302

1879112,5,B000094J7K,"Can a science fiction film exist without the science? I feel it can, but there are many who do not share that sentiment and those are the people who tend to dislike TIMEQUEST intensely because this is a film about time travel that has the audacity to mention not a single word about the technology that makes its story possible--it simply IS. It is hardly the first film to do this. TIME AFTER TIME hardly gives a logical explanation nor for that matter does the early film version of H.G. Wells' TIME MACHINE, but that didn't prevent us from being able to enjoy them. In TIMEQUEST we are simply asked to presume that it has been developed by a single man acting alone. It is the REASONS behind his need/desire to invent this device and what he intends to do with it as well as the repercussions of his actions on history that are the focus of this story--not a lot of pseudo-scientific babble and sleek shiny computer banks.

As I said, I feel a science fiction film CAN exist as more than a mere showcase for its technology, and the reason is because SF merely asks the question ""What if?"" In this case the entire question is; What if a time traveler went back to November 22, 1963 with the intention of stopping the assasination of John F. Kennedy, and by extension that of his brother Robert 5 years later? Why would he do it? The answer appears simple on the surface because a great many of us would give anything to be able to go back to that horrible day and stop it all from happening if we only could...but our time traveler is motivated by something beyond wanting to set history right and change the world for what he is certain will be the better. Why does he wait until almost the last moment--why not pop in a couple of weeks before hand? How on earth does he manage to convince anyone that he's anything more than a nutcase when he shows up in the Presidential Suite of the hotel in what looks like a deep sea diver's outfit? And what is the message that he won't let Jackie hear--only Jack and Bobby are privy to it? Lots of questions.

All of this could get terribly serious very quickly if it weren't for the film's sense of humor--which a few seem to have missed. The best part goes to Bruce Campbell playing against type as a futuristic maverick Hollywood director (read= Oliver Stone) who is firmly convinced that the Kennedy family has been involved in a cover-up for the last 37 years which he intends to reveal in his next film entitled NOVEMBER 22, 1963.
He's right, of course, although he could never begin to guess what it was that really happened on that date--much less what was supposed to have happened! Bruce's scenes also give us some funny examples of how stopping the assasination changed popular culture--for one thing John Lennon is still alive and still married to his first wife Cynthia, and the Beatles never really made it big in the states although they were fairly popular in Europe for awhile. As Bruce says, ""kids just couldn't relate to them."" I found the bombing of the Beatles to be an interesting sidelight in the film since many psychologists at the time theorized that their extreme popularity was a direct reaction to the truma kids suffered as a result of JFK's death.

For a low budget film everything looks pretty slick and polished. Some have objected to the the film's decidedly nonlinear approach, but to me it seems the perfect way to tackle a story about time travel and the fact that almost every scene carries a date at the bottom made it very easy for me to follow. None of the actors resemble their real life counterparts physically, but most of the voices and accents are good matches. Luckily Caprice Benedetti in the critical role of Jacqueline Kennedy did not try mimic her voice--it wouldn't have worked at all and might have sounded a bit silly. JFK isn't portrayed as a saint. His womanizing is brought out, and comes back to haunt him in a later scene when J. Edgar Hoover (nicely played by Larry Drake) tries to uses some evidence of his infidelity as blackmail against him. Robert Kennedy is portrayed as almost ruthless in his determination to protect his brother from any and all dangers, and is more than a match for Hoover in the blackmail department when he has adequate warning.

Have you ever wondered how your own life might have been different if you had done this or that, gone here or there, went right or left? Even the slightest change in the most insignificant of lives can have a ripple effect that goes outward and touches others, and so must their death. Who then is to say that the future shown in this silly little movie with its rose colored glasses might not actually occur if the leader of a powerful nation were to be spared assassination--especially if that man was aware that he was being given a second chance at life? It has been suggested that this film is only for die hard Kennedy fans. That might be true (its defintely NOT for die hard right wingers who kneel down in the direction of Bill O'Reilly every night to say their prayers) but with the rebirth of hope that Obama is supposed to have brought to our nation maybe this film will serve as a delicate warning of the day an earlier generation saw the first of three death blows dealt to its own dreams and naievete and innocence, and remind them that such history is only set right in science fiction movies. Bummer, huh?",1227398400,4,5381,4.510245901639344
1879113,4,B000094J7K,"As anyone who makes the mistake of watching the Sci-Fi Channel on weekends can tell you the term ""low-budget science fiction movie"" is almost an oxymoron. Here though is a film that proves to be far from it. In fact Timequest is a good exercise in how to make a movie on a low budget without looking (entirely) like it is low budget.

Timequest has a pretty good cast. True some of them may not be greatest physical look-a-likes in the world but they manage to catch the spirit of the real-life people they portray. This is true of the three leads (Victor Slezak as JFK, Caprice Benedetti as Jackie, Vince Grant as RFK) and especially of Slezak. Slezak makes you believe he is JFK in his appearances especially with his speech at Rice University and the sequence that follows it (which sells this film the best in my opinion). Then there's Bruce Campbell as Oliver Stone like director William Roberts. Now I'm not a Bruce Campbell fan by any means (far from it in fact) but I found his short appearances to be enjoyable none the less. While it is true the cast has a few misfires (Jeffery Steiger as Oswald and Dan Miller as Dan Rather both come to mind instantly) but for the most part it is a fine cast all things considered.

The main selling point of this film isn't the cast though but the story. Writer / director Robert Dyke has crafted a good alternate history film based around one of the most profound ""what-ifs"" of the last century: what if JFK had lived past November 22nd, 1963? The world that Dyke and the film shows us is perhaps a bit too optimistic for some but it seriously makes one wonder. The film also finds time to poke fun at some of the conspiracy theories regarding the JFK assassination in some of the most unexpected places which is fun for anyone who has a good knowledge of the subject.

That said the film does have some problems. The first of such is the time-travelers' motive for his journey (which is the one cringe-worthy moment of the film to say the least). But perhaps the biggest problem is the fact that the film viewpoint of the world is perhaps too optimistic (yes that is both a plus and minus sadly). There is also the matter of the jumping around in time which I've had people I've shown the film to tell me is confusing (especially in the first third or so of the film). For once though as the production values are excellent for the most part. The low budget nature of the film isn't an issue in a science-fiction film.

Yet outside of these problems there is a rather good film sitting here. From a fine cast to a well crafted ""what-if"" story, Timequest shows that that the term ""low-budget science fiction movie"" is not an oxymoron when done right. Here is an intelligent, well thought out, and well produced film that gives an interesting answer to one of the most profound ""what-ifs"" of the last century: what if JFK had lived? Here is a (perhaps too optimistic) answer and a good one at that.",1224633600,,2945,4.448148148148148
1879114,5,B000094J7K,This isn't a fancy typical hollywood movie but it keeps me very much engaged. The bits and pieces of the short segments make absolute no sense until the very last.

1879115,5,B000094J7K,"I just want to say that this movie is so good that it stayed with me for a few days afterwards. Its main pluses are that it is very realistic about what may have happened if JFK lived-it shows the power exerted by major players and doesn't present any sugar-coated hollywood fantasy. It does have some drawbacks to some people in that it skips around in time a bit, and is not very action-driven, but is rather plot-driven and character-driven, but i view this as a big plus.
It is one of the best and most grittily realistic time travel movies that I have seen. Very recommended for fans of the genre.",1201564800,2,602,4.383928571428571

Also, I really love the whole time travel genre, am interested in the JFK assasination. . . how bad could this movie really be?

Well, this movie is indeed very very bad.  As a matter of fact, I can't think of anything redeeming about this at all.  Let's see.  The plot? The plot was okay. Definitely not too interesting, but the premise of the film was good and the actual plot and subplots were even almost okay.  Everything else? Ugh. Just horrid.  The acting was stiff and unnatural.  Everyone in this movie just couldn't act.  The guy who played Kennedy was the most talented, I suppose, but it seemed everyone else was just reading their lines.  They were really really BAD.  And, OMG, the dialogue! The dialogue was unbelievable! It was so so so terrible.  My husband was in the adjoining room on the computer and I was actually EMBARRASSED for him to hear this movie that I was watching! The dialogue was just laughable-- unintentionally laughable.

There isn't too much more to say about this. It was really the worst movie I've ever seen. And, I've seen lots and lots of movies.  I'm trying to think of another bad movie so that I could mention it and then say this is even worse. But, I can't even think of a movie that is even at all as bad as this one.  I know that some of the Stephen King movies have been really bad. This is worse. I can't even think of something close that's comparable. I've disliked lots of movies, but I've found something redeeming in part of each movie I've disliked. Not this one. Complete waste of time.

I kept waiting for a twist or something at the end. It never came. Just horrible melodrama, although I wouldn't even call it 'drama'. I have to come up with a new word: melodreck.

Lots of useless scenes, too.",1197849600,2,1923,4.435897435897436

We have since placed him on an impossible pedestal and now that LBJ is the latest villain of that day in November this film has even more resonance. Superb casting has the best RFK ever, a Really Creepy Hoover. This film works best for those of us who were there and know the players.

Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed The Adventures of Brisco County Jr and wish it continued, but the fact that he had a small part in this movie doesn't really matter.

I'm a time travel junkie.  I love stories about time travel.  And almost every movie or novel gets it wrong by involving impossible paradoxes.  This movie didn't.  For that it gets an automatic 3 stars.

The plot is the dad from The Waltons comes back in time and warns JFK and RFK about JFK's upcoming untimely death.  A lot of the movie is spent dealing with their need to be convinced that this is for real.  However, once convinced, can they actually stop it from happening?

I don't want to give too much of the plot away, other than to say, I liked the follow up after the immediate issues are dealt with.  I enjoyed finding out what happened to the then young future time traveller in a few year's time.

1879121,1,B000094J7K,"In customer reviews there is excessive use of hyperbole and exaggeration when reviewing films. Way, way too many times the phrase ""Worst Film Ever"" or ""worst film I have ever seen"" is casually and capriciously used, even though the latter claim is most likely inaccurate and the first one almost certainly is inaccurate.

However, this film may well merit some of the more scathing aspersions. The general premise is not all that bad, although hugely farfetched (a time-traveller goes back in time to stop the JFK assassination). I am a HUGE fan of alternate/counterfactual history (as confirmed by my book buying patterns). I was intrigued by the storyline of this film and had very high hopes for it being an interesting and fascinating movie. Done well, it could have been an intriguing and maybe even a great film. Yet a lack of budget and an ENORMOUS lack of imagination made this a weak community stock theater version of an English composition essay. Besides the very conspicuous lack of even a vague reference to any scientific or sci-fi explanation, Papa Walton shows up in a diver's suit (the old fashioned kind like you see in fish aquariums) in the middle of JFK's supposedly secure hotel suite, then dodderingly proceeds to explain that he went back in time to prevent the assassination (no scientific mumbo-jumbo included).

Although the film does make an attempt to present an alternative to what might have been in history (the consequences of JFK's more unethical side catches up with him), mainly it is an embarrassingly bad soliloquy to a time-traveling stalker's love for Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy. An awkwardly large part of the film was Ralph Waite's character talking about his love for the First Lady (telling her directly), then asking for a slow dance with her as a reward for saving the President's life - I kid you not!

The acting was sluggish and palpably uninspired. I was literally embarrassed for the actors at a few points in the film. I swear it is as if the cast was using body language as if to say, ""how did I get talked into this film, and when OH DEAR GOD when will it end?"". Seriously, the actors playing the first couple were listless and seemed to be uncomfortable, although that part is understandable. Ralph Waite's performance or character was just plain creepy and off-putting, combining near-senility with a stalker's eeriness. Even Bruce Campbell (yes, I am a fan), who can generally be counted on to add some energy and interest to a film with his appearances, is both underused and poorly directed.

This is way too much like a story written by some marginally skilled Kennedyphile who pines for the days of Camelot, complete with the embellished and exaggerated notions of virtue that were all too often imputed to it. If those who rave about this film can be honest with themselves, the notion that all of America's problems being solved as a result of an unabridged JFK (and later RFK) administration are a little on the ridiculous side, though he no doubt would have made some accomplishments.  Overall, JFK did a good job as President, but this film did not really do him justice as a portrayal.

Political leanings aside, you don't have to be a conservative or Republican to dislike this movie, which had an interesting and promising idea but became a weak and lazy result full of poor writing and acting. Do not be mislead by the inaccurate reviews that tell you otherwise. If you want a good film to make you feel good about the Kennedy presidency, watch THIRTEEN DAYS (although too much of that is focused on Kevin Costner's character).",1179705600,3,3597,4.821717990275527

These are just a few odd things thrown in this movie. Nobody looks like the famous people they are portraying. The closest is the woman playing Jackie Kennedy.

Time travel is such a strange subject to try to guess what would happen. Personally, I see events happening or not happening on a more micro level. That even one ""insignificant"" soul missing can make a huge difference in the world. Think on a small level. One person can make a ripple effect on the world. Just by turning left instead of right.

I couldn't believe it, but Timequest edged out T2! And I almost didn't rent it, even after reading the synopsis. I really like SF, but time travel is difficult to do well, and that goes double for films. I was worried that this would be a turkey.  Boy was I pleasantly surprised!

Looking at the other reviews, you will either love or hate Timequest.  So... how can you tell beforehand?

First, if November 22, 1963 is etched on your mind like 9/11, then this movie will hit you like a ton of bricks.  (I was just a little kid, but I still remember walking home from school that afternoon).

Second, if you need lots of eye candy (explosions and such), then you'll hate it - the movie moves rather slowly, though there are many parts with unbearable tension.

Third, if you liked the funny references to historical people --as was done in Forrest Gump, you'll like that part of it.

Forth, if you hated Forrest Gump and loved T2 for the same reasons I did, then you will like Timequest. Forrest Gump was the philosophical opposite of T2. hint: the floating feather vs. ""no fate"". If you understand that, and if you want your movies to make you think and feel deeply, then you'll love Timequest.",1144195200,32,1392,4.470355731225297

Love the way it was cut especially the different looks (i.e. the news broadcasts of 1963 and 2001). I thought the asides were cool too. Dan Rather still an obsure local newsman, John Lennon and The Beatles virtually forgotten, RKF and MLK the future president and vice president respectively, and Bill Clinton a racy book author.

I remember being in kindergarten when JFK was shot and a neighbor calling our house with the news.  While not being exactly a Kennedy aficionado over the years, I found this film a fascinating what-if scenario.  Space travel, Vietnam, J. Edgar Hoover, and even the CIA take on entire new meanings. The acting is well done, not overly melodramatic.  I think they could have made it a PG-13,though, leaving out the Marilyn Monroe scenes.  More people would have watched it.

were when the news came in from Dallas on November 22, 1963,

this won't make much sense to you.

If you remember that time, when a generation saw a hero cut

down in his prime, then this film will reach you.

We now know that JFK was a hero with feet of clay, but in this

Alternate History, he got the chance to move on to real greatness.

This film gives us a view of a world in which 57,000+ Americans

(plus God knows how many Vietnamese) didn't have to die.  It

gives us a view of a world in which JFK didn't end up as some

contemptous horndog-womanizer.  It gives us a view of a world

in which Robert F. Kennedy wasn't gunned down in LA and Martin

Luther King Jr. became a Vice President of the USA.

If you can remember where you were when Walter Cronkite told

the world that the hope of a generation had been snuffed out,

this is a film filled with healing images.

No, it isn't perfect.  The exposition of the plot is more

convoluted than it needs to be, but it gives us a glimps of

a world in which the landing of a man on the moon (yeah, it's

still a man and not a woman) is a moment when all of humanity

celebrates.

What can I say? I was in a school classroom on November 22nd,

1963.  The man who gave us the Peace Corps and the challenge

of landing on the moon died that day. This film prevents

his assassination and the character assassination that followed

a few years later.

We live in an age brimming with anti-heroes. This film is

an allegory in which JFK DOESN'T become one of them.",1113868800,11,1583,4.108552631578948

1879132,5,B000094J7K,"What if JFK had not been assassinated in Dallas on 11/22/63?  What would have happened?  TIME QUEST, reminiscent of an OUTER LIMITS or TWILIGHT ZONE episode, is a daring and evocative look at the powerful Kennedy family and what might have happened had JFK lived.  A time traveler from some future (played harmlessly by Ralph Waite) appears in the Presidential suite in Dallas on 11/22/63, and informs Jacqueline Kennedy about her husband's fate.  Kennedy himself is then brought in, along with younger brother Bobby, and in spite of the absurdity of this time traveler's claims, they believe him, thus sending the US into a time of peace, world harmony and ""Camelot.""

Victor Slezak doesn't look like JFK, but he does remind you of him, and his performance is passionate and controlled; Caprice Bennedetti as Jackie comes across more like a porno queen but she still has a dignity and charm; Victor Grant is an impassioned and feisty Bobby Kennedy; Barry Corbin a blustery and inept Lyndon Johnson; Larry Drake has a brilliant brief appearance as crossdressing J. Edgar Hoover; Rick Gianisi is the third Kennedy child, James; and good old Bruce Campbell makes a brief appearance as an Oliver Stone like director who plans on making a movie exposing the conspiracy of 11/22/63.

The film jumps around from different times, sometimes in black and white, and overall, for a low budget film, it's quite well made, and it can't help but be intriguing.",1098835200,8,1447,4.934156378600823

1879134,5,B000094J7K,"Picked this one up on a whim due to the presence of low-budget film favorite Bruce Campbell (appearing here in a brief bit just to signal to genre buffs that this little film is worth checking out), and moreover because I was impressed that a filmmaker would actually believe that this often-thought-of concept was a concept that he or she could do better than anyone else.

And as it turns out, this little low budget film manages to tell a solid story that will appeal to anyone who enjoys the old or new ""Outer Limits"" series.

Low budget or no budget films are rarely perfect and this is no exception. Yet so much of this film is perfect, from a highly effective recreation of the look of the early 1960s, to a range of excellent main and supporting cast members (fans of Northern Exposure and Twin Peaks will recognize some faces here in the supporting roles), and -- not least important when making a film about Texas and the Kennedys -- excellent voice work. The bizarro Kennedy family accent sounds entirely natural - something that even high-budget epics about the Kennedys have not managed to achieve.

Beyond the realistic 1960s environement, the generally good cast -- including the lead actress who reminds me of Linda Fiorentino -- this is a sweet story whose feature length running time manages to give what short ""Outer Limits"" episodes often do not -- time to revel in the alternate world that it so effectively creates.

TimeQuest is the kind of indie low budget film that, like a college level theatrical production, can either be an unexpected pleasure, or a complete waste of time. This is firmly in the former category, no question. My rating of five stars acknowledges that this is not a high budget feature film; it is a five star indie film in the sense that it transcends its budget and my expectations, much to my delight.",1094169600,11,1849,4.68

The story line was okay, a somewhat far fetched thought of what might have been had Kenneddy lived. However, the script was juvenille and poorly acted. The scenes jumped about and were hard to follow when watching for the first time. Random scenes, many including unneeded sexuality are thrown in for no reason at all. Most do not even fall into the plot. I would not recommend it to any one, even a die-hard science fiction fan.",1087516800,4,548,4.228571428571429
1879137,5,B000094J7K,"Have you wondered why manned space missions just petered out after we got to the moon? Do you suspect things might have been different if JFK hadn't died in 1963?

Well, according to this extremely thoughtful direct-to-video SF movie, you're right. See, a guy comes back from the future and prevents JFK's assassination, and the result is . . . well, that's the movie, so I'd better not spoil anything for you.

As has been noted, the film does jump around. But it's not confusing at all; in fact it's extraordinarily well handled. The jumping around is part of the process of exposition, and that's where most of the drama in the film lies. At any rate you won't have any trouble knowing which scenes are happening when.

The alternate history of the Kennedys is also quite well handled. JFK is respected but not worshipped or whitewashed -- and in general, far from lionizing the Kennedy clan, the film takes a fairly gritty and politically realistic view of them. This is a future that could actually have happened, if only . . .

Parts of it are laugh-out-loud funny, too. I won't spoil any of _that_ stuff either, but you'll enjoy all the little references to what-would-have-become-of-so-and-so-in-this-alternate-history.

If you enjoy time-travel and/or alternate-history stories, you'll like this movie. (And as others have noted, it doesn't make any difference whether or not you're a 'Democrat'. For whatever it's worth, I'm politically small-l libertarian myself.)",1083974400,57,1475,5.053497942386831

The movie is terrible, with jerky, illogical, and hard-to-follow scene changes, laughable dialogue that wasn't intended to be laughable - all intermixed between otherwise boring filmmaking. The acting is mixed as well, with most of it achieving a level of mediocrity and no higher. One of the most hilarious scenes is with the ""man from the future"" who wears one of the most ridiculous ""space suits"" I've ever seen. No lie - it looked like a piece of crap. Still, it was good for a few laughs. In fact, the whole movie turned out to be an unintentional comedy, and that's how I ultimately viewed it.

Also, how could avoiding Viet-Nam be a bad thing?
