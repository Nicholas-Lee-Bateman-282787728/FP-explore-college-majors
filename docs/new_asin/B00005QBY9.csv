We so enjoyed our copy of the ""Honeymooners Original 39 episodes"" that we decided to order the ""Lost Episodes"" which come in Boxed Sets.  We had seen a lot of mixed reviews of the ""lost episodes"", but we wanted to judge for ourselves and we just didn't want the fun to end!  We are glad we bought the ""Lost Episodes"" and continue to purchase the other boxed sets that are available in order to complete our collection.  If you are true Honeymooners fans and love their comedy, you will enjoy the lost episodes.  In Box Set 2 some of the bonus episodes are longer than the regular episodes and a few have commentary with facts and bloopers. We found this informative as well as fun. We also bought some as gifts, because who can't use a little comedy in their life these days! The ""Honeymooners Lost Episodes Boxed set 2 is 6 hours & 18 mins. long.  It includes the following:
In Vol. 5: The Next Champ, Expectant Father, and a Bonus Episode ""The Honeymooners Greatest Battles""
In Vol. 6: Move Uptown, Lucky Number, and Bonus Episode: ""The History of the Lost Episodes the First Season""
In Vol. 7: A Little Man Who Wasn't There, Goodnight Sweet Prince, Ralph's Diet, and Bonus Episode ""Gleason's Honeybloopers 1""
In Vol. 8: My Fair Landlord, The Cold, Halloween Party, Lost Job, Bonus Episode ""Ralph's Sweet Tooth"".
We think you will enjoy them for years to come!",1260057600,5,1403,4.614457831325301
7950252,5,B00005QBY9,"As a little girl, I enjoyed watching The Honeymooners with my family.  Now, as a big girl, I'm still able to enjoy watching The Honeymooners with my family.  My 13-year-old son is in love with Norton!!!  The best part of watching The Honeymooners now is that there are no commercials and no waiting for next week to enjoy the next episode.  These episodes are timeless, rip-roaring funny and erase any and all stress from your life.  I highly recommend it.",1252713600,2,456,4.65
7950253,5,B00005QBY9,"These shows always bring me up when I'm feeling down.  These DVD boxed sets have bonuses and various bits that you won't find elsewhere.  I do not recall the VHS tape versions of these having the extras, nor were they as easy to navigate thru, as they are on these DVD's.  Included are Honeymooners BLOOPERS and a HISTORY OF THE LOST EPISODES.  Very nice packaging and artwork in an extremely durable 4 DVD case.  ""Ralph's diet, and Holloween Party are drop dead funny!  I agree with one of the other reviews for volume #1,  The quality is very good & exactly as I remember them when they aired in re-runs.  The camera techniques used in these shows were not of todays digital quality, but again, they are good as the finest copy that you'll find anywhere.",1087430400,13,756,4.507352941176471
