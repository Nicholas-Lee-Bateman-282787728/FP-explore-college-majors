8419885,4,B004AAJK0M,"have got to say i really enjoyed watching this film. Suspense was super class and was very unlikely to be guessed. Nana Patekar acting was superb. All others were not very good though. But, the film is lifted mainly by NP. A truly unique thing about the movie was the ending. I haven't seen such justified and unusual ending in any other film. If this is not a copy of any Hollywood film then its gonna rest into my all time favorite movies. Watch the movie and you would not regret 1 bit of your time spent.",1302480000,,508,4.247422680412371
