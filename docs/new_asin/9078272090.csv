1172399,5,9078272090,"I always hoped to find a product like this, with beautiful views of the sea and, the most important thing, only their sound, without inopportune music. This DVD is exactly what I wanted. An excellent way for relaxation. Their resolution is also excellent in a HD TV and the sound is spectacular.",1171929600,32,295,4.6923076923076925

1172401,1,9078272090,I tried to play it in 2 different dvd players but in both it said disc error. eject disc. This disc might be a different format from the ones used in the u.s.a.. I don't know. but if it is the seller should have put this info in the item description.,1399766400,6,250,3.9215686274509802
1172402,1,9078272090,Already sent the DVD back.  Not as advertised.  DVD was HD DVD which was not described in the information on the web site and would not work in my DVD player.  Advertising information needs to spell that out.  The other DVD - Weekend at the beach...SAID it was HD but it was not so that was okay.,1397779200,5,296,4.140350877192983
1172403,3,9078272090,"I have an ocean wave app for my kindle that is both visual and sound. I also have one that is just sound for my ipod. I find them very relaxing so wanted this dvd to play something along the same lines on a larger screen. This dvd will not play in my current dvd player. I have bought movie dvds and had no issue viewing them, so it must be the format of this dvd. Since it is the only dvd player I have I can not say if it would function in another player. The message on the screen says this device does not do playback. I was not even able to play this as I normally would a dvd in my laptop. I was able to open it up on my laptop, however, the enlarged screen of it does not fill my whole screen making it size wise not much better then viewing on a kindle screen. Also the program on my computer that did open it was not easy for navigating the dvd titles, etc. What I did see, the visuals are really good and so I'm disappointed I can not watch this the way I had hoped to. We need another dvd player for another room so my hope is that it will display with it. If not, then I will lower my rating further.",1397088000,2,1112,3.8391304347826085
1172404,5,9078272090,I purchased the DVD for my mother who has had four difficult months and now spends most of her time in a hospital bed in our home.  She has dementia and so following a television program is difficult for her.  She loves the ocean but I don't know if she will recover enough to travel.  I found this DVD on line and it couldn't be more perfect.  We found other nature DVD's but for the most part music was added.  This is completely natural with waves crashing and the sound of the ocean itself and without any music which is what we wanted.  I highly recommend it!,1392422400,,564,4.224299065420561
1172405,5,9078272090,"This DVD won't disappoint.  It was bought for a Reminiscence program
for seniors, and brought joy to everyone who watched it.",1387152000,,125,4.9523809523809526
1172406,3,9078272090,"The footage is exactly what I was looking for. The quality and format of the footage is not. I was really hoping it was widescreen, HD footage, but it is not. I guess it's my fault for not looking closely enough at the image of the backside box art which does say 4:3, but I feel a little misled by the product images. The rest of the images show a clean crisp image of the DVD on a widescreen format tv. I didn't notice the box art saying 4:3 until I had the product in had and wondered why it wasn't widescreen. The scenery would really be nice in HD, but as it is it's obviously a little fuzzy on an HD tv... especially if you stretch it to fill the entire screen.",1383177600,7,667,4.022556390977444
1172407,5,9078272090,I use this DVD to relax from hectic days.  It's wonderful.  I try to watch it every evening.  Very nice.,1382054400,,104,4.1
1172408,5,9078272090,"I bought this DVD as I live in the mountains. I put the DVD into my computer and watch it on the screen and listen you the waves as they roll onto,the beach. This is a nice product to,listen to during meditationmorbjust close your eyes and listen. Watching or listening is very enjoyable after a stressful,day.",1381795200,,310,4.553571428571429
1172409,5,9078272090,"Great video of beaches, nature at its best.  DVD production is excellent.  Very relaxing, highly recommended.  I really enjoy watching this, or listening to the waves on the seashore around the house.  Five stars.",1381190400,,213,5.176470588235294
1172410,5,9078272090,"When you spend most of your life near the ocean, the sounds become apart of your comfort.  They relax your body automatically and clear your mind.  It was where you went for fun and solitude and love.  It is your second skin.  When it isn't available, you find you are missing an important element of your being.  This particular DVD provides almost all the elements.  The direction of the ocean waves are accurate, no music just the comforting peaceful sound that penetrates your being and subconsciously relaxes you.  I leave it on all day while I am working at home.  I stay clam and in control.  It creates the perfect environment for stress free living.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nature-DVD-A-Day-at-the-Beach-Static-Long-Scenes-Of-Relaxing-Beaches-with-Ocean-Sounds/dp/9078272090/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nature DVD - A Day at the Beach - Static Long Scenes Of Relaxing Beaches with Ocean Sounds</a>",1380499200,,950,5.977777777777778
1172411,3,9078272090,"Not as described, pic on cover is not in DVD. Nothing other than waves and water. A little tedious at times.",1378771200,,108,4.190476190476191
1172412,5,9078272090,This is a truly stunning DVD. The scene is shot and stays in one place so that you feel like you are looking out a window at a beautiful scene. I highly recommend this DVD for relaxation.,1378598400,,187,4.081081081081081
1172413,5,9078272090,"This dvd arrived before the estimated time.  We are all enjoying the beautiful scenes and sounds.  My grandchildren also love it!
I would purchase this again!  It is a great way to relax and distress!  I would purchase this product again and do business with this seller.",1376006400,,271,4.702127659574468
1172414,5,9078272090,"This is a great mood enhancing video...relaxing and good to unwind to or even go peacefully to sleep. Also great to have on in the background while you go about your day, and pretend that this is your window out on to the beach. If you like fireplace videos or long for the beach...this is for you",1361491200,,297,4.228070175438597
1172415,3,9078272090,"Although the water is beautiful, the continuous closeup of the beach gets irritating to me after awhile.  I think there should be more of the beach shown and more different shots. The ones at the beginning and at the end are OK but not many waves. It just wasn't what I expected.",1357689600,,279,4.365384615384615
1172416,4,9078272090,"I wanted a good beach scene with crashing waves like Myrtle Beach on a windy day. This has five beaches and three are acceptable, and one is very good. Only problem at all with this is that there is totally no base in the audio. The rumble of the waves just isn't there. But still the best restful wave DVD yet. The 4:3 could have been 16:9 widescreen, but you can manually stretch it wide and never know just looking at it.",1357603200,2,424,4.182926829268292
1172417,5,9078272090,"Oh, how I love this disc. When I'm stressed out I just settle on the couch and watch the waves wash up on the shore. It's very nice seeing that I'm nowhere near a beach. I recommend it if you love the sights and sounds of the beach but can't get to one very easily.",1262131200,10,265,3.8363636363636364
1172418,5,9078272090,This was just what we wanted for my sisters wedding shower. It is just video of many beaches around the world.,1243728000,2,110,4.285714285714286
1172419,5,9078272090,"This DVD is perfect for those of us who love the beach but can't find the time to get away.  It's also great at the end of the day...come home from work...do the chores...then grab a cup of coffee, plug in the DVD, put your feet up, and you'll soon think you are sitting in that beach chair at the edge of the water....life is good!",1231632000,14,332,4.03030303030303

7901228,1,9078272090,"This DVD was ordered from Amazon along with 2 others.  The other s, Falling Snow and Fireplace played without problems on our DVD player.  The A Day at the Beach DVD's would not play on our player and had to be returned for a refund.  I would have liked to reorder but was afraid of having the same problem.  Can this DVD be ordered directly from you?  (I believe the A Day at the Beach was for a European DVD player).
