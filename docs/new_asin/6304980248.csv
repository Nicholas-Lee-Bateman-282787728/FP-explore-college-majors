942834,4,6304980248,"This film is classic Saturday matinee pirate fare from 1952. The tongue-in-cheek coupling of 18th century lingo with 1950's hip slang is clever.  Critics who bashed this film missed the point--it's simply to be enjoyed. It's a semi-farce,and should be viewed as such.
Excellent casting, charaterizations and script. Good seafaring musical score and great special effects considering the technology that was available at the time the film was produced. And Robert Newton, despite criticisms, is clearly the best pirate to ever grace the silver screen.  Good perfomances by Linda Darnell, Keith Andes, William Bendix, and Irene Ryan (granny Hillbilly).  Better than average in every way. But what less than a cool flick like this could you expect from RKO in the postwar era?  ARRRRH!",982368000,19,782,5.282258064516129
942835,2,6304980248,"The early 1950s proved to be a Golden Age for pirate movies as Hollywood countered the threat of small, black-and-white TV screens with big,  colorful adventures set in exotic Caribbean locations. Although  ""Blackbeard the Pirate"" has all the trappings of such rousing  adventures as ""Against All Flags"" and ""The Crimson  Pirate,"" it lacks the necessary verve and style needed to lift it  above the routine level.
  Robert Newton makes for a larger-than-life  title character but he'd be better in small doses and he's given little  opportunity to modulate his boisterous performance. Linda Darnell does what  she can with the damsel-in-distress part but that's simply not enough.  Keith Andes has the face and physique of an action hero but his bland  personality is probably what kept him from becoming a star. There is an  interesting moment when he's flogged across his bare back, and Newton  orders that salt be thrown on his bloody welts in order to increase the  pain. Here's one of those unique touches that the movie could have used  more of, but -- typically enough -- little is made of the situation. Andes  doesn't seem to be affected by the salt and there's no shot of his face to  show his reaction to this punishment.
William Bendix, Irene Ryan (in  her pre-""Beverly Hillbillies"" days), and a young Richard Egan  provide adequate support, but no one really seems to have his heart in this  project.",967680000,5,1413,4.9025423728813555

942993,5,6304980248,"As has been said before, Robert Newton is THE best pirate that ever was, bar none. I have watched this movie (DVD) now at least 50 times. Each time I am completely amazed at the way Newton can be so darn good as Blackbeard. I have rather extensively studied Blackbeard and have done so for over 53 years, so I have a pretty good idea as to the man. ....All he wanted was to be remembered......and he darn sure is. The movie is great,as are the other two he made as Long John Silver. There is NO comparison between Newton and the pirate actors of recent times. Long live the legacy of Blackbeard, and Robert Newton !!!",1362096000,,617,4.282051282051282
942994,2,6304980248,The movie itself is very good for 1950s acting and filming except the recorded vhs tape was very poor with voids and lines through the movie. The Seller stated that is was because of xray scanners during shipping and refunded full purchase price plus shipping costs.,1361059200,,266,4.804347826086956
942995,2,6304980248,"I have the latest ""Desert Island Films"" 2011 release of this movie. This is a washed out print, faded color, variable lighting. It looks like a dub of a bad VHS print, or recorded off a broadcast. Sometimes the image is sharp and clear, sometimes it looks out of focus. However, it is the only current DVD available. There are no chapters, no menu, you just put the DVD in and it plays. It even cuts off the closing scene prematurely.

I was not favorably impressed by the script, acting, or direction of this film. Newton hams it up, but can't save this sinking ship.
There are many fine sea yarns on film, but this is not one of them. Despite its detractors, I found&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cutthroat-Island/dp/B000NQRR1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cutthroat Island</a>to be vastly superior to this bilge.",1317168000,,858,5.355555555555555

Linda Darnell is simply Babe-a-licious.

942997,5,6304980248,"No one makes a better pirate than Robert Newton; not even Errol Flynn or Johnny Depp.  Newton made 3 great pirate movies...the other 2 being Treasure Island and Return to Treasure Island.  All three were filmed in the early 50s before Newton died of a heart attack, presumably from over-boozing.  I had an old VHS copy taped in EP and it was a dreadful print with lousy sound.  This DVD edition is absolutely excellent.  Vivid colours, clear, just a marvel to watch and the sound is clear.  As for skullduggery, swindling, rum drinking, and plain thievery, this has it all, including the famous lines:  ""Belay that""  ""Here be the treasure"", ""Har, matey"", :""You white livered scum"" as only Newton can deliver.  An absolute treat and a visual feast to watch.  Co-stars William Bendix, equally disreputable as Blackbeard, and the gorgeous Linda Darnell - one of the most beautiful actresses ever.  The story line is not even close to historical correctness but who cares.  So hoist the topsail and avast your jib..for 100 minutes and enjoy the golden age of Pirate movies.",1246838400,15,1069,4.845303867403315

Blackbeard, not wishing to get shot, ponders a moment and then announces loudly that he is coming down to settle matters.  He then grabs an unsuspecting crewman and throws him bodily down the stairs.  Bendix fires two shots and then must face the music.  (You had to be there.)",1245110400,7,410,4.8

SHE WAS CAPABLE OF DOING A GREAT ACTING JOB IN ANY ROLE AND SHE PROVES IT AGAIN HERE.

Edward Teach is a very convincing Captain Blackbeard and the other actors are equally great in their parts. I love the fact that there are so many twists and turns to this story, and I wonder if the beautiful Edwina will free herself from the ruthless Blackbeard.
I recommend this film for the entire family. It is a real classic to be enjoyed over and over again!",1473206400,,499,4.434782608695652
