174774,5,0965169073,"After discovering the shows on demand one day I introduced them to my 2 year old who was one at the time. She can count to 10, she says her ABC's and recognizes them, she can name some animals and she knows her colors. She loves First Impressions and so do I!",1237420800,,259,4.0
174775,1,0965169073,"Your  child will be exposed to all these sounds and many more in everyday life.
The only sounds useful may be the few animal sounds ( 5 minutes or so) but a trip to a farm yard will accomplish this with a lot more fun.
The sounds of various musical instruments could be heard at home, at a nursery or a live concert all of which would be a lot more fun.
There must be more interesting real activities to teach your baby soft verses loud.
In my opinion no parent needs this DVD it is a waste of money.",1219968000,,500,4.0
174776,5,0965169073,"We first started watching these on demand from our cable company, and our son was just mesmerized. He started watching around 14 months and by the time he was 20 months, he could identify all letters of the alphabet, and identify numbers from 1-10. He just turned 2 years old, and can identify 7 colors, numbers from 1-20, 5 shapes and now he even knows the *sounds* that letters make. This is one of the best educational things you can buy for your child. They are very entertaining and features a narrator, other children, animals and makes it fun for them to watch. Highly, Highly recommend!",1205107200,,594,4.613207547169812
174777,4,0965169073,"Our local cable service (Comcast) offers shorter versions of these videos through their on-demand service and it got my kids (twin 2 year olds) hooked.  My wife and I were very excited to find these and bought them right away.

However, at some point during transit, 3 of the 10 discs came loose from their cases, causing them to get scratched beyond repair before I even got to open them.  Amazon was very good processing the replacement, they had it sent out withing a few days.  Unfortunately, the replacement had the same problem.  Luckily it wasn't the same 3 so I swapped them out to give myself a complete set.

By the end, I was happy, the kids were happier, and I would still definitely recommend this to anyone.",1200009600,,721,4.550387596899225
174778,5,0965169073,"I WAS GIVEN TWO OF THESE ON VHS BY A FRIEND, HER KIDS WERE TOO OLD FOR THEM. I LEFT THEM IN THE BOX OF ODDS AND ENDS FOR MONTHS.

I CAME ACROSS THEM ONE DAY AND THOUGHT I WOULD PUT ONE IN.

MY DAUGHTER LOVED THEM, THEY ARE SIMPLE, ALMOST ON THE CHEESEY SIDE. BUT MY DAUGHTER COULD NOT GET ENOUGH, I JUST BOUGHT THE WHOLE SET AND MY SON IS NOW HOOKED.

THEY ARE A GREAT BUY AND I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM.",1167955200,3,407,3.764705882352941
174779,5,0965169073,"I do not yet own these DVD's, but will be ordering them soon. We watch them on our OnDemand cable channel. My son is just turning 3 years old and has been OBSESSED with these shows. Since he was 2, he's learned his alphabet - both forward and backward - he can count to over 100, and has even learned table manners!!! Learning shapes and colors came rather easy as well, and I'm trying to think of all the other stuff he's learned. It's really amazing. I'm sure it has something to do with us watching with him and using their techniques and terminology regularly.

These are GREAT educational programs, and looks like a great value here!!!!",1167609600,2,641,4.478632478632479
174780,4,0965169073,"I read the first review on this video and disagree with much of what was said.  Yes, the video is a little corny for adults, but it's NOT for adults...it's for KIDS.  My 20-month-old son (and ALL his little buddies) love it!  They love to hear all the sounds that things and people make, often giggling at the funny parts.  It's attention grabbing AND educational.  My son prefers real-life pictures to animated ones...great for kids like this.",1146700800,3,444,4.714285714285714
174781,1,0965169073,"I like only some of the Baby's First Impressions videos (actually most of them I don't care for).  I have reviewed them all.  Personally I think ""Sounds"" is a waste of time and it's boring.  I don't know why you'd really choose to set your baby, toddler or preschooler in front of this to watch.  As I watched I made a list of the catagory and the sounds in each catagory (I don't think I missed any, but it's possible).  Here's the list I have:

Home Sounds: telephone (they say, ""This is the sound that a telephone makes"" and then they have different kinds of rings), hair dryer, electric can opener, water running, water down the drain, popcorn popping (they say, ""This is what popcorn sounds like.  Do you like popcorn?""  Actually, they should have said, ""this is the sound popcorn makes *when it's popping*.""), eggs frying, alarm clock (2 kinds of alarms), door bell, vaccuum.

Animal Sounds: horse, donkey, ducks, cow, kittens, rooster, goat, dog, lion, pig.

Big/Little Sounds: big clock, watch, trucks, squeeky ball, saw, toy saw, train, wind chimes, big river, quiet river, drill, toy drill, jackhammer, crib mobile, hammer, toy hammer.

Musical Sounds: guitar, piano, tamborine, xylophone, saxaphone, horn, harmonica, drums, shaker, bells, pots & pans, and then they put different sounds together for a band.

People Sounds: sneeze, cough, laughing, yell, whisper, cry, humming, happy sounds, stomping, snapping fingers, clapping, crunching, kiss, whistle.

Then they have a Mystery Sound section and a Guess The Sound Review.  The one kind of clever thing was that in Guess The Sound they would have a basketball bouncing but the sound was crunching.  Then they'd say something like, ""no that's not the sound"" and then they's do the right sound.  Other things like that were kids clapping but the sound was bells jingling, a phone ringing but it sounds like a cow, etc.

I can see having videos for your young child about numbers, letters, colors, shapes and maybe even animals.  But, things like this (sounds, opposites) are easy enough to just pick up on and learn without having to be sitting in front of the tv for it.  In my opinion I wouldn't recommend this one (view it from the library first, at least).  Read my other reviews.",1116288000,5,2246,4.860526315789474
174782,5,0965169073,"THIS DVD SET IS THE BEST EDUCATIONAL SET MADE.  IT REALLY HELPS YOUNG KIDS LEARN AND DEVELOP WORDS, LETTERS, NUMBERS, ETC.  BE SURE TO INVEST IN A SET FOR YOUR YOUNG ONE PLEASE!!!",1294876800,,179,4.393939393939394
174783,5,0965169073,"We have this product for more than a year. My 22 months old son learned all the letters,colors,shapes from these dvds. He still likes these dvds.",1289260800,,145,4.615384615384615
174784,5,0965169073,"I bought these dvd's for my son when he was 3 years old, and he loved them. We watched them so much they got scratches on them. So now im buying them again for my other kids who are now ages 6,5,3 and 2.",1286582400,,203,3.6363636363636362
174785,5,0965169073,"I bought this for my daughter for her 1st birthday. She never watched tv, even if we wanted her to. But winter is coming and I figured it would be educational for when we could not go outside. We started out with the colors dvd, to my surprise, my daughter stared at the tv and didn't even notice I left the room! usually she would follow me or look for me if I left the room. She fell asleep before it was over (bedtime) but it was very cute and just what I wanted for her. Now I borrow them to my mom's daycare. the kids are 1-3 years old and some dvds don't hold the 3 year olds attention but they are very hyper kids. They all sat still and quiet watching the ""Seasons"" dvd.

I would recommend this to anyone with a baby to 3 years old.(even though the age is 1-5)",1285372800,,768,3.987012987012987
174786,5,0965169073,"My mother heard about First Impressions from a Doctor she works with that bought these videos for her child. She highly recommended them. So my Mom bought them for my daughter last Christmas. I have to say, it is the best gift she could have ever gave her. My 2 1/2 year old daughter has been watching these since she was 23mths. In that time she has learned the entire alphabet, how to count to 20, all colors, all shapes, and all of her body parts. I can't even list all the other things she has learned from First Impressions, but I can say that this is a must have for every child. She absolutely loves these videos and asks to watch them all the time. I don't mind letting her watch these all the time, because I'm just glad she is so interested in something that teaches her so much. I've seen her around other kids her age and she is so much more advanced and I believe it is because of these dvds. What is so great about them is that they use bright colors and every day items to teach children their letters, shapes, colors, sounds, animals, etc. They make it very fun and entertaining for the children and I highly recommend these dvds to anyone who has a child 1-5 years old.",1284854400,,1186,4.252212389380531
174787,5,0965169073,I have a 2 1/2year old son who was very speech delayed.  At 29months he was at about 18months in speech.  I first started working with Baby bumble bee videos that someone offered to lend me.  My son did enjoy those videos but when I was looking to buy the set I started reading the reviews and saw that people recommended first impressions videos instead so I purchased these.  Since I recieved these videos my son has done a complete 180!!  He is talking at least 3x as much as he was and is just a happier little boy because he can now communicate with us.  Everytime I turn these videos on he gets a huge smile and starts dancing and clapping.  This is something we can do together and he is so proud of himself when he can point and tell me what everything is.  I have never been so happy with a product and the results we have seen.  I would most definitely recommend these videos especially to those with toddlers struggling with talking.  I also have a 7month old daughter and when the music comes on at the beginning of the videos she also starts clapping and laughing I can just see her absorbing all of the information and learning with us.  Very impressed!!  Thank you first impressions!!,1280880000,,1199,4.375565610859729
174788,5,0965169073,"We had started out parenting with every intention of limiting our child's TV time. Then my brother introduced us to Head to Toe, another excellent DVD from this educational series by Small Fry Productions, and we are now firm believers in selective viewing. I disagree with the previous reviewer who said that this DVD is a waste of time because children can learn about sounds from daily life without having to view a DVD. Yes, it is true that children hear all sorts of sounds every day but the challenge is that you cannot always be present with your child to explain what each sound is related to. And often even when you are present, it might not be convenient or practical. Example: You and yor child are in your living room when you hear a car horn. You can tell your child that was a car horn but this is meaningless to a very young child. You need to tell your child it's a car horn as well as show the car making the sound, or even a picture of a car. Otherwise, a car horn remains an abstract concept. After only a few viewings, my child is now more aware of the sounds in her surroundings. We also own other DVDs in the series: Head to Toe, Numbers, and Colors. I highly recommend all for their ability to impart knowledge to young children. Keep in mind that these DVDs are not high art by any means and they don't have to be. Simple production values are enough to deliver simple concepts. My child is entertained enough to ask for the DVDs to be played and although I find them mind-numbingly boring, I am not the target audience.",1271721600,,1545,4.349480968858131
174789,5,0965169073,"I tried to make my son watch several among of Brainies Baby, Baby Einstien, Barney etc.
He was least interested and hardly even look at those animated or cartoony characters.
Once by mere chance I picked up this DVD from public library. I was least hopeful before putting in.
Amazingly he watched whole DVD without any movement. For me, it was great surprise. I had even given up
hope that he will ever be interested in watching any of baby's or children video content.
Its been almost 2 months since he watched it first time. He has seen it 100 of times. Every time like he is watching it first time.
He is just 16 months old...identifies most of sounds...start making them even before they come up on screen.
I've ordered whole 10 dvd set of baby's first impressions recently.
Just curious why he likes this dvd and not any other. May be this is very simple, all of it is completely real.
Its his nature, banging twisting things to find what sounds come from real stuff. He sees that on screen.
Anyway good four our baby....lets see if likes other of first impressions dvd or not.",1260662400,,1082,4.49746192893401
174790,4,0965169073,"I did order the 10 DVD box set several weeks ago.  However I never recieved them.  I was in the middle of a move and I contacted the company as soon as I realized there was a problem.  They workde with me wonderfully.  I still to this day haven't recieved the movies, I believe they are lost in the mail somewhere.  However the company did give me a full refund of my purchase and told me if I did recieve them in the future that I was just lucky.  I will order from them again, as soon as my moving is done and over with so I can guarantee I will recieve the movies.",1252281600,,567,3.9298245614035086
174791,5,0965169073,"My 2 year old daughter loves these dvds.  She's just as happy watching them as any disney movie and it's much better for her.  We started her watching them when she was 1.  At first the letters and animals were the only ones she really got into.  But now at age 2, she is very interested in all 10 of them and will ask for them by name.  ""Daddy Numbers Movie"" Kids learn best when watching other kids doing things.  These DVDs show other children involved with learning the concepts.  Sometimes the kids are just holding the letters on the playground or dressing up as animals.  Either way she seems to identify with it a lot more than some animated character trying to teach her.  I highly recommend these DVDs and you can't beat the price.",1240358400,,741,4.389705882352941

7795403,3,0965169073,"Our child seems to be more interested in the puppets and animations on films like Baby Einstein and Baby Genius. These Baby's First Impressions seem even lower budgets than the other films I mentioned. I understand that baby films aren't designed to entertain the parents, but they should at least hold the attention of the child for more than 2 minutes. Our child hasn't yet sat through a whole film.",1391558400,,401,4.742857142857143

Although they get annoying for my husband and I after the 1,000,000 time of watching them, it's worth it for all that it teaches. She has actually been watching these shows since she was a year old, she will be two, Jan 26. She is still intrested in them.",1386028800,,321,4.278688524590164
7795405,5,0965169073,"We found the Baby's First Impressions numbers video at our library sale when our son was around 4 months old.  He LOVED the video and watched it all the time.  When he was 15 months we moved and forgot to bring the video.  We found out later when he was almost 20 months that he knew his numbers.  Even if he couldn't really say the name of the numbers, he could identify them.  We were amazed!

We wanted to get the rest of the set, but the 10 Video Encyclopedia cost about $100. Then we found this condensed Encyclopedia for only $35!

Once again, my son LOVES the videos, especially the Alphabet, Colors, Numbers, and Head-to-Toe videos.  As he gets older, I am sure he will enjoy the rest of the videos.",1376092800,,707,4.303030303030303

While some parents may frown upon watching videos, I am all for it...within reason of course.  In my opinion educational videos such as First Impressions quickly helped my son to recognize colors, shapes and sounds.  All babies develop differently.  I am 100% satisified with my purchase.  Try for yourself and see if it works for your child.  I'm a believer in educating children through all learning modes.  Videos like these do an excellent job.",1371513600,,574,5.042553191489362

Amazon was kind enough to take the product back and refund it but told me if you reorder it , it will take another 3 weeks to get the product.

To wait for one product for 6 weeks is really bad and I thought the price was less for this product and ordered in Amazon but it was not worth it.

She loved the sounds, the kids, everything. I'm not sure why it has such a low rating but we loved it and I still have it and will show it to my son once he's old enough.
