2223753,3,B0007OC7EQ,"A first rate production - just don't expect palm trees and temples - great conductor - but Lend Me A Tenor!  Nakajima just doesn't make the grade in singing or acting.  His big duet with Grassi just falls flat.  The two voices aren't compatible and there isn't an ounce of genuine affection or friendship shown between the two men.  This is also not the regular version of Pearl Fishers you are used to hearing.  There are more choral arrangments which were interesting to hear.  If you must have a PEARL FISHERS, I suppose this will work even if there are a few moments you will cringe over the tenor.  Good luck!",1114387200,61,614,4.4774774774774775
2223754,4,B0007OC7EQ,"A surprisingly strong performance taped live in Venice's Teatro Malibran (temporary headquarters of the Fenice company), with a talented young cast, beautifully conducted by veteran Viotti.  Star turns from soprano Massis (exquisite, floating high notes) and Grassi (wonderful, masculine sound in full control).  Less successful is tenor Nakajima, whose average instrument is neither strong nor controlled throughout in pitch.  Pizzi's production is great, given the tiny stage of the Malaban, and the Fenice orchestra and chorus are superb.",1113609600,46,541,5.910256410256411
2223755,4,B0007OC7EQ,"A moving, theatrical performance, marred only by the sound quality.  At times I had trouble hearing the soloists (mostly in the first act), and in general had to crank up the volume.  This is not a Metropolitan Opera extravaganza, but a modest yet atmospheric production with a curved foreground where most of the action takes place (and where dancers frequently perform), in front of a temple where the chorus is situated.  The simple set and colorful costumes are visually appealing.  Some ""stand and deliver"" but at least the cast can act.  I was unfamiliar with the opera but enjoyed it immensely. No famous songs as in Carmen, yet very melodic and dramatic.",1345680000,,662,4.875
2223756,5,B0007OC7EQ,"Enjoyed this production performed in Venice with the incomparable Massis. What a voice. The music and staging are

 beautiful and the CD captures the opera very well. We will have The Pearl Fishers performed this summer at the Santa Fe Opera in New Mexico and I wanted to preview it since I have never seen it before. Purchased it on Amazon.com

2223757,3,B0007OC7EQ,"This is one of those opera productions where you really need to close your eyes and just listen. I didn't do that, of course. The first thing to catch my notice was the stylized set and exotic, erotic, slithering over the top dancing and the lack of action from the four major characters. I kept thinking of that raunchy Thais production with Eva Mei and Michele Pertusi, so I checked my DVD copy and, lo and behold, it was also staged and directed by Pier Luigi Pizzi! Unable to shake this comparison, I could barely focus on the Pearl Fishers.

Annick Massis' angelic voice is the only thing that saves this production, apart from Bizet's beautiful music. I can only imagine how wonderful she could have been in another set, where she was allowed to act. My impression of Yasu Nakajima as Nadir was that he did not know his lines as he seemed to be always looking at a prompter rather than his partner on stage. Otherwise, his performance was competent. Luca Grassi as Zurga and Luigi De Donato as Nourabad were very good also (and seemed to know their lines).

If you're on a tight opera budget, I'd recommend you buy a CD for the music and skip this.",1231372800,5,1154,4.464454976303317
2223758,2,B0007OC7EQ,"Massi is great in the role of Leila.  Nakajima is terrible (to say the less) in the role of Nadir, Grassi is OK in the role of Zurga.  The production is horrible.  Very italian!!! sometimes you feel like watching one of those popular variety shows presented by the RAI with some exotic (and very distracting) dancing at the background whilst the singers deliver their parts.  It is particularly intrusive and disgusting the circus style dancing that takes place during the famous duet of Zurga and Nadir.  The sound of this DVD is pretty bad as well.  Overall two stars mostly because Bizet and Massi.",1186358400,8,601,4.730769230769231
2223759,1,B0007OC7EQ,"Where the hell did they find this tenor?  To think I have a domingo recording of this and I just watched this junk!  If you don't believe me watch it and count how many time Nakajima has to stop during the ""je crois"" aria in order to breath.  He has no skills, no power, no breath and the high notes come out horrible.  Oh my gosh.  This opera is my favorite Bizet opera and now I feel betrayed.  This guy does not deserve any role but perhaps to be a chorus singer.  I realize your choices for Pearl Fishers are limited but don't waste your money.  Just buy a CD recording instead",1181174400,21,581,4.125
2223760,5,B0007OC7EQ,"This creative production is very well sung, danced, conducted, staged, and filmed.  Annick Massis has a world class voice and the baritone Luca Grassi  also has a major beautiful voice.  Yasu Nakajima is better than some of the other reviewers state, but just not a true world class tenor.  Truthfully he doesn't act and often is looking at the conductor not relating to his fellow singing actors at all.  He is however much better than just adequate.  I've seen and heard a lot worse.  The unit set works very well and the choreography most of the time is quite creative and highly effective; especially during the great Tenor and Baritone duet.  I also found the camera work interesting and not distracting.  It may be a long time before we get another DVD of this delightful score so let's be thankful for what we have.  It works and has many fine moments.  The conductor Marcello Viotti is excellent.  In conclusion: very well sung and creatively produced and filmed.",1179964800,14,971,4.748502994011976
2223761,4,B0007OC7EQ,"Pearl Fishers has a lot of beautiful music and, since this is the only DVD of it available, I recommend it. Everyone is adequate but none is outstanding. Leila looks much too old for the great beauty she is supposed to be (this would not be a problem with for the theater audience) and occasionaly is a little harsh. The filming with its superimposed closeups is sometimes distracting. But even with these shortcomimgs, it is still an enjoyable DVD.",1169856000,15,449,4.69620253164557
2223762,5,B0007OC7EQ,"Firstly let me say that the following is my personal opinion and it may not be yours; but think about what I have to say and hopefully you will give this little gem a dust and polish and see it for what it is.

Les P?cheurs de Perles is one of those rare operatic gems, just like the real thing. A very easy opera to stage, yet not staged enough. This production from the Teatro la Fenice di Venzia, achieves just that. It is an opera that does not demand powerful voices, so you do not require a Domingo/Milnes here. The production is first rate and the cast equally as good. Though being a traditionalist where sets & costumes are concerned, I actually find this set works.

My previous colleagues seem to disapprove of Nakajima's voice. Granted it is not a powerful voice, but as I stated in the beginning, this opera does not require it. We have been spoilt by having had the cream of the opera world sing it, but that does not have to be. As far as saying he's off pitch, he is not and as in the duet (the original and not the traditional); he & Grassi blend exceptionally well.

Annick Massis' L??la is just something again. I can not wait to see her in something else. She has actually recorded two Donizetti's Operas for Opera Rara: ""Elvida"" and ""Francesca di Foix"".

One has to remember that this is a performance of the ORIGINAL ""Les P?cheurs de Perles"" and not the one we have grown up with, so there are some changes that we have to come to terms with. Like Nadir's aria not scraping the paint off the ceiling, but gently letting it die away. The Duet melody we are use to in ""Au fond du temple saint"", actually appears as a trio at the end of the opera. There are other subtle changes as the opera goes on. I actually prefer this `Original' production and if looked at through fresh eyes, you will too.

This means not trying to compare it with previous versions, because you can not, it IS quite different and you have to forget all the others and treat it on it's own merits.

All in All; this is quite a performance and deserves to be added to your collection. After all; we are NOT going to get another DVD production for many, many years to come; if at all. I welcome this work into my collection with no reservation.",1146009600,64,2235,4.309523809523809
2223763,4,B0007OC7EQ,"This isn't a great opera but it has some beautiful moments. The plot is cliched, but the exotic locale helps leaven it and Bizet supplies some gorgeous ""Asian"" sounding music. The principles are all up to their roles. Massi as Leila is wonderful although she looks a little old for the part. The tenor Nikajima has a sweet if somewhat weak voice and Grassi has a nice baritone. The production uses a unit set but varies it when necessary. Another element is the dance which flows throughout the production and enhances it. The CD of this performance would not challenge the EMI set with Barbara Hendricks. But when you add the visuals it earns its place.",1123804800,23,654,4.646551724137931
2223764,2,B0007OC7EQ,"Poor singing and/or acting by the four principals, particularily the tenor, made this an unattractive acquisition for me. Also the orchestra did not do much in the way of enhancing Bizet's music.  The chorus sang adequately. The costumes were  good and there was some imaginative use of the camera but this is an opera to be heard.  If this was a CD version, it would not rate more than 1 star.

Microphones may have been poorly placed or bad sound engineering might also be part of the problem.",1123804800,10,495,4.590909090909091
8049448,5,B0007OC7EQ,"This production from Venice's Teatro La Fenice offers so much more atmosphere and exoticism than the current Met production. The costumes and settings (though the latter are more abstract) give a stage picture that conjures the South Asian locale convincingly. The dances add color to the telling of the story.
Though the singers are less well-known, they are more than adequate. Annick Massis' soprano has enough heft and agility to project her character with passion. Tenor Nakajima, though underpowered, has a sweetly melting voice that I would take over many ""can-belto"" singers out there today. Overall, a satisfying Pearl Fishers to look and listen to. Alas, the days when we can get an all-French cast in this opera---much less on a DVD are probably well-past.",1498867200,,767,5.144
8049449,5,B0007OC7EQ,"Had I seen and heard this many times in the past with different Companies, were I an expert in the  technicalities of voice production, were I......well, you get the drift, but I am not any of those things. I'm just someone who has seen opera when the price of tickets made them accessible and when I lived where there were operas to be seen, has listened on disc to some, but who mostly watches opera on DVD's he owns and does so in exactly the same spirit and with no more knowledge than when watching Oklahoma, Follies or A Funny Thing.......From that angle, yes, I did note some failings in the tenor, yes, the staging was not exactly what one would have seen at the Met, Yes, I did notice that Massis, up close, was not a good match for the more youthful appearing tenor, but............overall, it was quite an enjoyable piece, one with which, I believe, the average non-expert viewer will be pleased. It may not be Bizet's most highly regarded, it may not be in the Top Ten of all operas written, but for a couple of hours  pleasure in the evening after a days labor in the vineyard, it is a good bet.
(Of yes, the Third (last) Act, with Massis in superb voice,  Nakajima and Grassi, keeping pace with her, is really quite thrilling....and, alone, is worth the price of admission....as they say.)",1452816000,,1303,4.489451476793249

8049451,5,B0007OC7EQ,This was one opera I've never seen and totally enjoyed.  Never saw Annick Massis -- she was so good I took the time to look her up on the internet.  What a history this woman has - has sung all over the world.  Wonderful DVD to have.,1431561600,,233,3.9148936170212765

8049455,2,B0007OC7EQ,"I practically memorized the Micheau-Gedda-Blanc recording of my adolescence, and in my book, that is exactly how this opera should be sung: by an all French cast.  With that sound in my ears, I got this DVD, which is a failure first of all because it does not ring authentic. All concerned are in good voice, except the tenor, a particularly unfortunate miscasting, but there is no chemistry between them, no real magic as one can hear in the Zurga-Nadie duet as interpreted by Gedda and Blanc. This is the only performance on DVD.  By the way, if interested: there are twelve pages of ""Carmen"" recordings!",1385164800,,606,4.7075471698113205
8049456,4,B0007OC7EQ,"Great production. Thank God it is not modernized, like so many great operas.
I can't understand why Traviata, Rigoletto, La Boheme, etc. has to be vandalized by ""modern staging"". They are written in a sertain era for a certain period. It sounds redicilous to hear their liberettos in an ultra modern setting. Besides, can the present generation not learn history?",1360972800,,363,5.066666666666666
8049457,3,B0007OC7EQ,"The Pearl Fishers contains some absolutely beautiful music.  Of course, the famous duet is amazing, but overall the opera shows that it is one of Bizet's first.  In it you can see the genius that is to come!  This production is very interesting to sat the least.  I still haven't figured out the Orange arced stage floor.  But, it works!  The two male principles are OK.  We've all heard the duet sung better by the ""Great"" stars.  Since this is the only full length production with English subtitles, it is worth it.",1351900800,2,517,4.543478260869565
