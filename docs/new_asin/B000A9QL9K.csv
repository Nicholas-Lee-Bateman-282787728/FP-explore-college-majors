8076571,2,B000A9QL9K,"This is a two-DVD set. The opening titles say ""Diamond Entertainment"". I got this just because I was curious exactly what was on it.

Disc One:

Jack Benny: Christmas Shopping and New Year's Eve episodes. At least Jack talks about Christmas during the New Year's monologue.

Adventures of Robin Hood: The Christmas Goose.

Four Star Playhouse (called Four Star Theatre here): The Answer and The Gift.

Finally, the box shows Racket Squad: Christmas Caper. The DVD menus show a couple of stills from that episode. But every time I tried to play it, I got dumped back to The Gift. I guess if you use the disc menu, it's still lost.

Disc Two:

Liberace: It starts abruptly with the last 20 minutes of an unknown show, plus an awkwardly read PSA for The Heart Fund. Then there's a full, 26-minute Christmas Show, followed by a full Easter (!) Show.

Dragnet: The classic, heartwarming Big Little Jesus episode and the sad, cautionary Big .22 Rifle for Christmas.

Burns and Allen: A Christmas show, listed on the box as the 1951 version.

Plus photo galleries (which looked a lot like screen captures from those episodes), biography and trivia (which looked a lot like Wikipedia snippets).

Finally, my usual DVD player couldn't play the sound on a couple of the episodes, but my computer handled everything okay. Windows Media Player also let me jump blind into Disc One's ""Title 15"", which turned out to be that Racket Squad episode. So maybe it's all viewable with the right equipment, but there's still not much to recommend this set.",1258761600,16,1535,4.776515151515151
