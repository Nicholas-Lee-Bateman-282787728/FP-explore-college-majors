8675104,5,B00MWP6XM0,"Wonderful film!  And Balanchine introduces each of his dancers!!  Amazing to see these perfect ballet dancers who were choreographed on by the amazing George Balanchine!  And then the fuzzy, but still worth watching, film of Tanaquil Le Clerc and Jacques d'Amboise dancing Jerome Robbins' ""Afternoon of a Faun"" is breathtaking!  Definitely worth buying and watching several times!!",1501372800,,381,5.631578947368421
