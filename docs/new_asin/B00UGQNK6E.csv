8706657,3,B00UGQNK6E,"After the medicine show is broken up by the sheriff, Johnny runs off and comes upon a cabin by the river, where five young children live by themselves. (Turns out their parents died in a river accident, and they exist hidden from society.) They slowly suck Uncle Johnny into taking care of them. He tangles with the richest man in town, falls in love with the judges daughter, but agrees to marry a rich spinster so he can better take carer of the kids. The first scene of this film finds Holden in black face singing as part of a medicine show. (It does get better from there.) In fact, Holden does a lot of singing in this filmat least his lips move to someone singing pretty well. He does well in the role, and the acting all around is well done. The story is engaging, the kids are cute, there are some truly funny scenes, and theres heartwarming sentiment throughout.  Not a great movie but a light diversion. The movie gets more interesting as it moves toward the ending credits, and its entertaining enough to watch.",1525564800,,1023,4.470588235294118
