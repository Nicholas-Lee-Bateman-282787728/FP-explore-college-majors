8026775,5,B0002DRC74,"What can I say, sucker for these type of Camp films. Brought to the big screen by Cannon in the day, story about a career criminal named Rita who comes to a small town and seduces a dumb local into robbing his wives bank. He gets killed, Rita escapes and the wife is sentenced as in adding them. In prison she has to learn to fight by any means to survive till. You guessed it. Rita shows up.
  Not a blockbuster but still a good story with good acting and good production values.
  Worth a look.",1502323200,,496,4.135416666666667

8026778,3,B0002DRC74,"Nothing like a big hair prison girl film. Michelle (Shari Shattuck) is wrongfully convicted and is forced to three years (90 minutes real time) to be in a woman's prison with a lesbian warden, raping guards, and girl gangs. There are better prison girl films out there. This is also part of a dvd multi-pack.

8026779,3,B0002DRC74,"Let's face it, there's a lot of us that like a good ""women in peril"" movie.  This one was illustrative of the type, I guess.",1363910400,,124,3.96
8026780,5,B0002DRC74,This is an old movie from the 80's that I used to watch all the time. I'm glad I was able to find it and purchase it again after all this time. It's a really good movie. Rita is a tough chick that I wouldn't want to mess with. Some parts of this movie are a little cheesy....hey it's from the 80's! But it's also one of my favs. You should totally check it out.,1341705600,2,361,3.8266666666666667
8026781,4,B0002DRC74,"I've always enjoyed this movie.  I probably shouldn't have been watching it as a child, but I did and still enjoy it some 15yrs later.  I'm really glad I finally found it, been looking for it a long time now.  The action is cool, the storyline is fun.  It's so typical of the nudity and violence of the 80s.  The storyline is cool though: innocent chick gets sent to jail for a supposed bank robbery and all hell breaks lose!  She fighting crazy guards and fellow inmates.  It's missing the 80s sex scene, but other than that, it has all the elements.  Worth getting if you're an 80s movie fan!",1336262400,6,594,4.336363636363636
8026782,2,B0002DRC74,"THE NAKED CAGE opens with a shot of a two-lane highway as a really nice pair of legs adorned with red cowboy boots walks across the frame to the music of The Fabulous Thunderbirds 'Tuff Enough'. The first thought this scene conjurs up is ""Damn, the eighties"".

The legs belong to Christina Whitaker who plays badgirl escapee Rita (and the rest looks just as good as the legs). Rita is, of course, up to no good as she involves one of her rides, Willy, in a bank hold-up where, interestingly enough, his ex-girlfriend Michelle (Shari Shattuck) is a teller.

Things go bad during the hold-up, so they end up taking Michelle hostage. During a shootout with the police, Willy is killed while Rita and Michelle are taken prisoner (huh). Of course it plays out that Rita fingered Michelle (stop that) as her accomplice, so they both go to prison.

Being the naive, young, innocent girl in prison, Michelle is introduced to a world of protection rackets, violent inmates, drug addicts, and bad acting. Of course the prison is populated with the usual suspects in a WIP flick: a corrupt warden (female, lesbian, and played by Angel Tompkins); a sleazy guard called Smiley who thinks rape is a normal daily activity; a contingency of black inmates interestingly lead by a woman who does not believe in violence or drugs; a heroin addict who cannot stand up for herself and needs a big sister; and any number of stereotypes that were shaken out of other prison flicks and landed here.

Rita also shares this cellblock with Michelle and has an axe to grind, or at least wishes she did as she starts off with a screwdriver and advances from there. Rita apparently is blaming Michelle for getting caught and is wanting to snuff out the perceived thorn in her side.

THE NAKED CAGE starts off interestingly enough for the first ten minutes, which makes it appear as though this is going to be an interesting film, then takes a nosedive into boredom and annoyance for the next 30-40 minutes before it picks back up again. It then becomes a mediocre film at best with some entertaining action sequences.

THE NAKED CAGE does provide a good amount of nudity which is expected from WIP flicks. The character of Rita is particularly nasty, well played, and hot. And it does provide an interesting sub-plot which I will not reveal. It unfortunately is also littered with too many annoyances and poor writing to really make its good parts pay off. It does become an entertaining watch for the WIP flick fan but I would not highly recommend it for anybody else.--Bob",1142726400,11,2544,4.692825112107624
