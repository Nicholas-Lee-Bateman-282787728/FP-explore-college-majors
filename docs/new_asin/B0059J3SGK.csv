The Pranayama breathing portion was challenging in that I had never done the alternate nostril breathing. I have already started to incorporate this into my daily practice. I started to really feel a major difference after only a couple of practices with these techniques, which are said to restore imbalances in the brain, improve sleep, calm the emotions, boost your thinking, and calm your nervous system.

The exercises in this DVD have varying complexities and provide great variety. This was an investment that I am really happy I made, for myself and for the others around me.",1358121600,,774,4.856060606060606

8462993,5,B0059J3SGK,"I love this yoga and mediation DVD, thank you Jenn for making it.  Since I'm relatively new to yoga I found the Gentle flow more my speed then the moderate/intermediate Flow. But with Jenn's ease and gentle coaching I felt confident in trying the intermediate and surprised myself at how much I could do. But what really impressed me was the time devoted to the pranayama breathe and meditation. New research is just coming out on how important this is, even making significant changes in our brains, everything from making us nicer people to curing illnesses. Jenn's instructions are easy to follow allowing me to enter a deeper meditative state then I could before. Since I can't always attend a class it's great to have a DVD to practice with at home. the beautiful location is pretty cool too, very calming and makes me feel like I'm there.",1311897600,,844,4.702702702702703
8462994,5,B0059J3SGK,This DVD is a great accompaniment to any home practice. I found it challenging and informative. I work up a great sweat every time. Jenn is very descriptive in each asana so you fully understand the proper posture and alignment. She takes you from gentle to intermediate giving modifications for the more or less advanced. Jenn Kretzer inspires you to take the next step in your practice and includes several arm balancing poses such as side crane. The DVD is well crafted with beautiful cinematography which accents this well rounded practice. I highly recommend!,1310515200,,564,5.01063829787234
