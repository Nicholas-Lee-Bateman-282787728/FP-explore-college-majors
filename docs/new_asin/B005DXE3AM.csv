8467700,5,B005DXE3AM,"Andrea is a great teacher, being clear in her instructions with beautiful photography making it easy to follow along. Just lacks a little polish. Not a deal breaker, but a little more enthusiasm in the voice would make this perfect. However, it's not a deal breaker and the video is worth having if you want the basics of Portuguese knitting.",1399766400,5,342,4.716666666666667
