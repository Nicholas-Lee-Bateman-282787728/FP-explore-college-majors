8690534,5,B000T8YE9Q,"I highly enjoyed this short video.
The video is a trek through a pond where the naturalists handle and tape the habitat all many pond creatures like birds, turtles and fish.
It's a great one for classrooms and fun to own for the nature fans too.
Has a fabulous dated look since it's so old, but is well-preserved and in color.",1191196800,3,326,4.360655737704918
