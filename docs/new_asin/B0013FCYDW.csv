3105606,5,B0013FCYDW,"Even though he was once one of the great ""pop stars"" in the world...Lindsey Buckingham is an artist.  He creates songs from his heart...he plays guitar in a unique and beautiful way and really truly is like  no other.  Spending an hour and a half with him in  concert is inspiring and fun...and speaking of fun, Lindsey can be so personal and heavy in his art its great when he just plays dumb/fun  rock  and ""Holiday Road"" which was his theme for National  Lampoons ""Vacation"" gets a real workout at this show!",1206316800,,511,4.489130434782608

8250629,3,B0013FCYDW,"I have loved Lindsay's solo work from the beginnings. The man has shown immense talent in his guitar, songwriting, and audio production skills. This DVD feels a lot like a touring concert. There is a broad spread of songs from his career, however I didn't see a whole lot of exposure from his first three albums. There is basically one track from Law and Order and one track from Go Insane. I couldn't even find anything from the Out of the Cradle album. Sure there a few notable Fleetwood Mac hits as well as his National Lampoon hit Holiday Road, but not much else. It seems most of the tracks are coming from his album Under the Skin, which makes me beg the question if this DVD was really just footage of the Under the Skin tour. In other words if you wanted to see Lindsay cover his illustrious career in depth this isn't the disk for you.

This is a more intimate concert. Many songs are performed just by Buckingham, which does give this footage an edge if you are intersted in seeing his guitar talents. It has been many times begore that Lindsay has a signature style in his playing and you get to see it in action. I even noticed at one point he was getting so into the playing that one of his fingers was bleeding. A good portion song however are performed by a small group of musicians with him and those songs vary from an acoustic ""unplugged"" jibe to an all out rock band performance. The downside to all this is none of the songs are performed in their original composition. If you are a stickler for hearing the live set as close to the album as possible you will be sorely disappointed in this concert. On the other hand if you are on the opposite side of the spectrum then you can give a hearty three cheers.

What's my take? I wish there was more to this concert. There isn't enough balanced representation of Lindsay's catalog of content. I feel some good career songs were put aside in an attempt to promote the current album at the time. Some of the acoustic sets... just a few... didn't jibe with me either for some reason. I think it's just me. I would have preferred a different approach here and there is all. I would have been happy with a more condensed performance in this format, along with some quality filler for the DVD release.

The DVD also includes a ""documentary"" on the production of his Under the Skin album at his home studio. Well... I'll be blunt. It's not a documentary. It's just footage of either Lindsay doing work on the studio or just plain footage set to music. I will admit it is an intimate kind of feature that has a lot of feeling and reflection in it. However there is nothing in the way of production notes or comments or even footage of the songwriting or sound recording process. It's kind of like one long music video montage or a mini-art house vignette.

In the end I do not think this DVD suits a lot of casual LB fans or people just getting their first exposure to the man's work. It's definitely a great and personal gem for the die hard Lindsay Buckingham fan. Everybody else it could be a acquired taste.",1347408000,,3069,4.378947368421053
8250630,5,B0013FCYDW,"Yet another fantastic live performance by lindsay buckingham. He always seems to be giving his all while on stage. You just know he loves what he does. The song selection was excellent. I wish the song trouble wouldnt have been done acoustic though, the original uptempo style of this song is so much better. Lindsays not afraid to make an ass out of himself, all the hollerin and dancing would problaly embarrass alot of artist but lindsays so caught up in the moment that he cant help himself. I to agree with another reviewer on here about lindsay not doing anything from the out of the cradle cd. This is his best solo album and I to wonder why he chooses not to perform any of these songs live. The sound on this dvd is superb. All in all this is a must have if your a fan of this extrordinary musician.",1314921600,,808,4.322368421052632
8250631,5,B0013FCYDW,"If I talk about Beethoven, Rossini, Bartok... Lindsey becomes a classic in this century !  This concert has improved all from the previous.  The recording was superb and the musicians also were doing the best performance.  He was so devoted and dedicated at the song "" I Am So Afraid "".  I burst into tears every time when playing this title !",1275696000,,343,4.483870967741935
8250632,4,B0013FCYDW,"I have always enjoyed the unique singing and playing style of LB.
He's a power house on guitar and vocals.(with or without the Mac)
Great video, captures all his musical force.",1266019200,,176,4.709677419354839
8250633,5,B0013FCYDW,"LB is a very stylistic guitarist that not only gets the job done, but goes on beyond that. He can flow and he is also one of those exceptional players that absolutely loses himself to the music. If one plays an instrument improvisationaly you know what I mean. One goes into a different space where something absolutely new is being created on the spot. Lindsey Buckingham can and does do this. This dvd is worthy of anyone's music library. Get it!",1256947200,,448,4.54320987654321
8250634,5,B0013FCYDW,The quality of the picture and sound were superb. It was just like being at Bass Hall.,1211846400,,86,4.117647058823529
8250635,5,B0013FCYDW,"We went to see this concert at the beautiful Bass Hall in Fort Worth. He let us know they were making a DVD of the performance, so we could hardly wait. It didn't disappoint! If you're a Lindsey Buckingham fan-(or even Fleetwood Mac fan), you will love this!",1209168000,,258,4.395833333333333
8250636,3,B0013FCYDW,"I was really disappointed that nothing was included from what I think is Lindsey's best CD, ""Out Of The Cradle"".

And I wondered why we needed yet ANOTHER live version of ""Big Love"" and ""I'm So Afraid""?  We have live versions of both on ""The Dance"" and ""Live In Boston"" while ""I'm So Afraid"" is also on their first live CD.

Because I've always loved ""Go Your Own Way"" I don't mind that being on here. And the slowed down reworkings of ""Trouble"" and ""Go Insane"" are terrific--I wish ""Tusk"" was also on the CD (it's only on the DVD.)

As for the concert, it's okay--you watch it once or skip around and watch your favorite songs. Then file it away.

The ""Not Too Late"" documentary consists of home movies of his family and some music videos (very raw) he did for his ""Under The Skin"" CD. Sounds like he was trying to get a record deal for ""Under The Skin"" and talks about how the record industry doesn't give new artists a chance and his solo contract with Warners expired....but they went on to release ""Skin"" and this collection. So it makes his whole point sort of moot.

I was no fan of ""Under The Skin"" but this live collection caused me to go back and listen to it again. It's a little too personal, ""too produced"" but has some great songs....but nothing like ""Out of the Cradle.""

So because other than the new arrangements of some old favorites, there's not much here/hear.

So, 3 stars. GOOD, but not GREAT...and certainly not EXCELLENT.",1206576000,,1445,4.446969696969697
