3540345,1,B001DW2BKG,Was not real impressed with this one on the civil war. Not too well put together although the info in it is good.,1281225600,3,113,3.9565217391304346
3540346,3,B001DW2BKG,"I purchased this set for $5 at a major chain store.  I must say it's barely worth what I paid.  It's poorly produced and the editing is shotty at best.  The voicover and historical value is the only redeeming quality this set offers.

The re-enactments are not to my liking, but they're tolerable (when the same scenes aren't being repeated and repeated!)

Here's the kick...The credit segments at the end of each episode are over 2 minutes...what's up with that!  So many credited people couldn't spin a decent product?  This will never be shown on anything but some public access channel.  Buy at your own risk.

Ken Burns this is NOT",1272672000,12,636,4.657657657657658
3540347,4,B001DW2BKG,"This is an extremely in-depth look at the Civil War and covers many topics quite thoroughly.  A minor gripe I had: while the use of reenactments of battles is not necessarily a bad thing (I'm a reenactor myself), when they use the same scenes over & over & over for many different battles it can get tiresome after a while! 3 1/2 stars.",1240790400,19,336,4.333333333333333

8295033,1,B001DW2BKG,"seriously, think of all the awesome things you could have put on these dvds. things like old tom and jerry cartoons! or maybe a great how to series about how to make how to dvds! anything! but no, alas, you put this worthless pile of crud on it, which claims to be a breathtaking ten part series. it was breathtaking in the fact that i was breathless in my attempts to remove it from the dvd player before it gave the player a permanent case of stupids. dull dreary narration, pointless photos, incredibly poorly made re-enactments, which are repeated over and over. go watch something else. really. this is pointless and stupid.",1382659200,,629,4.625
8295034,3,B001DW2BKG,"Although MCE has renamed this 10-part documentary series CIVIL WAR: UNION DIVIDED, its actual title is TERRIBLE SWIFT SWORD, and lest we forget, an annoying bar across the top of the screen blares these three words for almost half of each 45 minute segment. Used to cover the program's original title (watch for it!), this is removed only for clips of public domain movies and videotape images of reenactors.

It soon becomes apparent that (for example) Super 8 footage of Union troops walking a Virginia forest path also appears in a segment on a lesser-known Kentucky battle, and the same soldier falls dead in EVERY chapter! Visual repeats become laughable. (Note that chapter 7's audio in incorrectly mixed, with music and gunfire drowning out voices.)

Most of the reenactments are shakicam home movie quality, which is too bad. We notice that artillery pieces make an unimpressive POP! instead of the booming reports we've come to expect in Hollywood movies, and a staggered volley of rifle shots sounds like a mat of lit firecrackers. Some of the reenactments are filmed with a camera mounted on a tripod and are nicely edited, but these are in the minority.

The only reason this series gets a middling grade instead of a straight F is that it accurately covers some obscure battles (like Bull Run of the West) and doesn't just focus on the famous ones. Missing are the Crater disaster, Mary Chestnut, Lincoln's post-war visit to Richmond, the Battle Among the Clouds, Clara Barton and a few other expected subjects.

Narration and voice actors are sincere enough. TERRIBLE SWIFT SWORD is an earnest attempt to explain an internal conflict that had origins in the 1830s. It's an OK introduction to the Civil War for any history student.",1338076800,4,1744,4.921768707482993
8295035,1,B001DW2BKG,"This is absolutely the worst documentary I have ever seen, bar none.  A shockingly amateurish waste of time and money.

I don't often waste time writing reviews of bad productions.  But this one is so atrocious, I feel an obligation to warn others. Not only is it not worth the $4.99 bargain basement price (which should be a tip-off).  It isn't even worth a dime at a neighbor's yard sale.

It looks almost like a bunch of Civil War re-enacters hired a camera crew just to create an excuse to get their faces on video.....and then they often repeat the same re-enactment scenes over and over again....some of them riding their horses in circles and shooting their pistols into the air to avoid getting powder burns on the faces of the other re-enacters.  Some of the battle re-enactment cinematography is actually pretty good -- the first three or four times you see those same scenes.  But overall it is an amateurish, cut-rate ripoff of Ken Burns,presumably designed to lure careless buyers who mistakenly think they're getting Ken Burns.

Everything the other reviewers say is correct.  Endless, numbingly boring trivia about individual battles that nobody cares about except a West Point seminar on squad-level battle tactics....usually without any attempt to explain where the battle was fought or why it was historically important.....or even how those individual battles fit into the overall military campaign or the war.

There is this huge build-up to the Battle of Atlanta, arguably the biggest turning point of the entire war.  But suddenly the documentary just dumps that subject in midstream before the fall of the city after merely remarking in passing that a few cannonballs fell in the city.  Not a single mention of the burning of Atlanta or Sherman's triumph there or how it split the Confederacy in half and doomed it.  It's almost as if the director suddenly looked at the clock as the Battle of Atlanta began, and said:  ""Oops.  Sorry, folks -- we just ran out of time.""  Then abruptly it's off to some battle I never heard of in ""Franklin,"" wherever that is. They leave it to you to guess where.

Instead of animating the original Civil War photos like Ken Burns did so skillfully, these people usually just give us a series of static shots.  There are endless static photos of Civil War generals that look like they're merely pasted into somebody's scrapbook....frequently three or four generals pasted onto the same page like somebody's high school yearbook....the same photos of the same generals over and over and over again.  The pattern is numbing:  totally generic re-enactment scene....scrapbook of generals....another generic re-enactment scene....another scrapbook of generals.  This sort of old-fashioned television went out of style 50 years ago.

The script writing is positively atrocious. And the narrator drones on and on in a monotone.  They totally miss the sweep and agonizing drama of the Civil War.  It's almost impossible to screw up a story as colorful and sweeping as the Civil War -- but these people somehow accomplished the impossible.",1334534400,4,3085,5.015717092337917
8295036,2,B001DW2BKG,"I started out liking this series, the pre-war material is interesting and contains some factual material not typically mentioned in most Civil War coverage.  As the war raged on, however, I became more and more lost in trivia.  Not that trivia's bad.  As a live-long civil war buff, I thrive on it, but in this series the details, particularly the tactical details of battles, quickly dominate the narrative.  Battle maneuvers are covered in great detail, with only the briefest of introductions and summaries to put the battle into perspective of the whole war. And the tactical reportage of battles,without useful battlefield maps to enable the viewer to comprehend what's going on, is particularly annoying.  That's less a problem with major battles most of us are familiar with, like Gettysburg or Vicksburg, but with the many lesser engagements in Kentucky, Tennessee, etc. that are covered in some detail in this series, one gets lost in the re-enactment trivia.  When the narrator tells me that so-and-so ""led his command to the top of the hill cheering wildly"" and I have no visual idea of where the hill is, who's occupying it, or why it's important, it's just tedious.  Others' comments about the re-enactments are apropos, too.",1307318400,3,1238,5.03921568627451
8295037,3,B001DW2BKG,"Extremely in-depth look at the major battles of the Civil War.  I would say this 10-part, 3 DVD set is worth the $5 I paid for it at the big box store.  It is not well produced.  Lots of use of re-enactment footage, but the same clips of footage are used over & over to coincide with descriptions of battles.  I believe that ALL of the footage in these DVDs actually came from one re-enactment.... from the Perryville Reenactment, when it was the major reenactment of the year, a few years ago.",1282953600,8,494,4.336956521739131
