8389613,5,B00366BBUI,Great run through of basic western history. Fun to own and binge watch!,1474329600,,71,4.538461538461538
8389614,5,B00366BBUI,"Very interesting.  Something they didn't mention was that it was a fairly common practice for the owners of the brothels to buy their girls from the orphanages.  At some point the Salvation Army found that the ""average"" life span was 4 years for girls/women entering this profession.  That is, if they didn't manage to get out, they died from disease, suicide or were murdered.  I found it interesting that they thought the high suicide rate was actually a result of botched abortions (the women accidentally poisoned themselves)",1431907200,,529,5.045977011494253
8389615,5,B00366BBUI,"Wonderful program from the History Channel. Very true to life wild west grit - and funny too! A few hints and secrets of the ""professional"" women of the early western towns!",1393200000,,173,4.612903225806452
8389616,5,B00366BBUI,"Western movies have never provided a realistic picture of how the west really was.  People seldom bathed then; they thought it was unhealthy.  The stench must have been powerful.  Towns weren't as picturesque as Hollywood shows them.  Streets were full of cow and horse manure.  There were outhouses with drinking water sources in the same vicinity.  Many men chewed tobacco and spat anywhere.  The ""soiled doves"" were nicknamed Big Nose Kate and Squirrel Tooth Alice, which is a hint as to their attractiveness.

This video shows at least one part of the west as it really was.  Being a prostitute was a dirty and dangerous business in the 19th century.  Hard drugs were rampant, often disguised as medicine.  The women were victims of violence, even murder.  There was the danger of venereal disease and pregnancy.  The johns were an unwashed bunch of cowboys, gamblers, drifters, miners and the like.  All in all, it was an unsavory picture

Fans of western movies and novels should see this video to get at least a peek into the way things really were.  I certainly wouldn't want to go back to that era.",1290816000,6,1107,4.777777777777778
