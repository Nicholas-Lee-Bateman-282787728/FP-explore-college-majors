8638345,4,B00I1ZSC4C,"I'm surprised at how engrossed I was by a story about creating a physical dictionary at the dawn of the internet age.  Matsuda and Odagiri deliver wonderful performances.  They make it believable that the oddball and the cool guy would develop a friendship.  Miyazaki is fine, but, alas, her role is underdeveloped.  All in all, while this movie won't change the world and it's a bit too long, I enjoyed watching it.",1457481600,,416,4.736111111111111
