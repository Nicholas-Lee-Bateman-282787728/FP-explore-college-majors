4121658,5,B003GAMN6K,"**Dont Read this if you don't want logical but possible spoiler info**  So as a typical dance movie: 1) There's a good guy dance crew and a bad guy dance crew, 2) There's a conflict that requires some kind of contest to be won, 3) someone in the good guy crew betrays the good guys, 4) the good guy dance moves are given to the bad guys, 5) totally unnecessary and movie draining love story is involved. <~OK so to get past what we all suspected & it truly delivered... it also delivered some *&^*%&$^# AWESOME Dance skits! I watched this movie 4x in 3d theatre and tho the story line makes my brain hurt, my eyes were glued to the screen for the dance battles/skits. Dont expect great story, expect the same story you've seen on every other dance movie made EVER and you won't be too disappointed cuz thats what FastForward is for!! I'm so excited to get this DVD & watch the dances...Perfect for those who actually know & can appreciate different dnce styles: Tutting, Crumping, Breaking, Pop & Locking, and Robot... Fun Times! I'm so XCited!!!",1292803200,3,1046,4.505263157894737
4121659,5,B003GAMN6K,"If I were rating Step Up 3D simply based on the acting or writing - you know, the usual movie criteria - then I'd have to give two stars out of five, at most. Heck, to this day I have trouble remembering the two lead characters' names because they were so bland and had zero personality. The only person I *do* remember clearly is Moose, played by Adam Sevani.

However, no one watches this sort of movie for the stellar acting or plot. There was one reason, and one reason only, why I watched Step Up 3D - the dancing! And in that respect, the movie more than delivered. The dancing is absolutely fantastic. It's the sort of movie that makes you want to get up and dance yourself, or attempt to, anyway. And for a dance movie, I don't think there's any higher praise.

Another surprising highlight of this film was the 3d! It might sound laughable, but I think Step Up showcases some of the best use of 3D since Avatar. No, really. I think the difference between Step Up 3D and all of those other post-Avatar movies is that most of the latter were filmed in 2d and later converted to 3d film, whereas Step Up 3D was conceived in 3d and filmed with 3d cameras from the start. With other movies that have been converted to 3d, the 3d seems like nothing more than a dumb gimmick meant to drive up box office receipts. Step Up 3D on the other hand fully utilizes 3d technology in order to make the dancing really 'pop.' Unfortunately, since 3d-capable TVs are still a relative rarity, most people who watch the movie at home won't be able to see Step Up in 3d format.

In short: The acting? Meh. The characterization? Non-existent. The storyline? Trite. The 3D? Surprisingly great! The dancing? OMG COMPLETELY AWESOME I NEED TO SIGN UP FOR A DANCE CLASS RIGHT NOW!! (<-- You get the idea.)",1291939200,96,1786,4.406060606060606
4121660,4,B003GAMN6K,"This film is about university freshmen participating in various breakdance showdowns and competitions. The plot is simply about young people getting together to dance, and caring for one another. Of course there is some heavy rivalry and some betrayal. But in the end everyone matures and develops quite nicely.

But the real attraction of this film is the dancing which is really an advanced freeform mixture of acrobatics, gymnastics and breakdancing - DO NOT TRY SOME OF THESE MOVES AT HOME.

There is an abundance and a wide variation of:

- head spins
- windmills
- flips
- hand stands
- helicopter spins
- robotic movements
- leg contortions

The charged, synchronized and meticulously choreographed routines serve to excite the imagination. It is a healthy way for youths to spend their time and extra energies. I am just simply amazed at some of the routines and dance movements that are presented in this film. They make it look easy, but I am sure that it takes a tremendous amount of effort to really get it looking so good.",1291334400,,1035,4.797752808988764

4121663,5,B003GAMN6K,While the plot to this movie isn't great the dancing more than makes up for it...if you're a big Adam G Sevani fan (Moose from step up 2 the streets) you will absolutely love him after seeing him in the second one..he is one of the best dancers around and hes still only 18 (he certainly steals the show from the main character Luke that's for sure)...it does have some LOL bits that did make me laugh out load...the dances in this one are definitely a step up from the first and second films...i really liked the 3D effects too...i have seen quite a few 3D films this year and was really disappointed with many of them they may have had 10-15 bits actually coming out at you while this film has many more....if the bonus features on this DVD are gonna be anything like Step up 2's then it would be worth it just to see the added extras....hopefully things like how the movie comes to life and all the hard work that goes into it will be on there...really loved the ending it had lots of creativity and imagination and a couple of little surprises along the way...although the ending was predictable....i would give it a 9/10 and most of that is for the dancing...will definitely be buying this when it comes out....,1282262400,5,1216,4.408888888888889
4121664,3,B003GAMN6K,"Being a big fan of the other two Step Up movies, I was so excited when I saw that this was coming out.  While the first movie had a solid plot line and the second one had not as much of a solid plot line (but it was still there and it still made sense), this movie left me wanting more out of the plot.  The characters were not well developed, there was a hint of a plot line, but it still could've been better.

The plot?  A young man (Adam Sevani of ""Step Up 2) and a young girl (Alyson Stoner of ""Step Up"") are going to college at NYU and Sevani meets up with this man making a film (Rick Malambri) about street dancing and Malambri sees that Sevani is really good, so he is recruited to dance at the World Jam.  Oh, and there's this other girl Natalie (Sharni Vinson) who shows up, too, and has a little bit of a secret that is revealed about halfway through the movie, removing that plot suspense.

What was left out of the plot and character development for me, was made up with the dancing and music.  I know a few people go and see these movies just because of the dancing, but if I go see a movie, when they aren't dancing, I don't want to be bored and I don't want to be able to make several bathroom trips because I know that I won't be missing anything while I'm gone.

I still enjoyed the movie, but I am personally getting tired of all of the 3D movies.  Some of the movies are great with it (Toy Story 3, for example, and Avatar), but this one could've done without it because their 3D effects were reminding me of those horrible 3D movies from the 1950s, where they're all in your face.  There were scenes in this movie where I know that if it was not a 3D movie, those scenes would not have been in there.  For example (and this isn't giving anything away because you can see the majority of these in the trailer), there is one part where they randomly go up on the top of this roof and stand on an air vent and drop straw-fulls of slushee in the air between them, making the slushee fly up in the audience's face.  At one dance-off, they were constantly blowing dust toward the audience, or they were dancing with their arms reaching right toward the camera, making it seem like they were about to hit you in the face.

Those scenes are great if you are on the Terminator ride at Universal, but it's not something I want to see in a movie.

But, as I said before, what was lacking with the plot line, characters, and sometimes the cheesy acting, was made up for with the phenomenal dancing.",1282003200,3,2508,4.165631469979296
4121665,4,B003GAMN6K,"I really liked the dancing but that's about all there is to this. Other than the dancing, there is a predictable rather lame storyline to tie the dancing together. Ultimately though, because of the great dancing, I enjoyed it. I saw it in 3D but didn't find that it added all that much to my experience. I would have liked it just as much had I seen in in 2D.",1281398400,,359,4.142857142857143
4121666,2,B003GAMN6K,"""Step Up"" taught us about the redemptive and freeing power of dance. It wasn't a particularly good or original lesson, nor was it a particularly good or original film, but at least what it had to say was clearly stated. ""Step Up 2: The Streets"" taught us the exact same thing, despite shifting the location from the studios and auditoriums of the Maryland School of the Arts to the streets of Baltimore, where, miraculously, street dancing was at the last minute accepted as a legitimate art form. Now we have ""Step Up 3-D,"" and while the location has changed yet again - from Baltimore to New York City - the message itself hasn't changed at all, and quite frankly, I'm sick of hearing it. I officially get the point; for some people, dancing is the only good thing they have going for them. Now that we've thoroughly established this, can we please find something else talk about?

What annoys me to no end is that the film does more than recycle a message. It also recycles a plot formula and waters it down in the process. This is pretty strange given the fact that there wasn't much of a plot to begin with. The original ""Step Up"" was basically a low-rent retread of Alan Parker's ""Fame,"" focusing heavily on the choreography and the music but skimping on the maturity and the introspection. In other words, it lacked the sense that we were glimpsing into the lives of real people in real situations. ""Step Up 2"" went even further in its whittling away of the plot, reducing genuine drama to a contrived dance off between street crews. Now that we have come to ""Step Up 3-D,"" the plot has become so thin and inconsequential that every scene evaporates from our memories, even before they end.

The only exceptions are the dance sequences, which are impressive to say the least. The choreographers, and there are many, stage a number of routines that push the actors to the limits of human endurance; they contort, kick, flip, jump, and spin so intricately, you'd almost swear their bodies were manipulated by computers. And then there's the film's big draw, its presentation in 3-D, which is - and it greatly pains me to say this - the best use of the process since ""Avatar."" The dancers really did seem to be reaching out of the screen. I actually felt immersed in the environment. The final dance showdown is especially great to look at; apart from the 3-D effects, the heroes were decked out in suits rigged with flashing LED lights and lasers. They looked liked extras from ""Tron.""

The plot: Robert Alexander III, a.k.a. Moose (Adam Sevani), has moved to New York City to attend NYU with his best friend, Camile Gage (Alyson Stoner), who just happens to be the little sister to Tyler Gage, played in the first and second films by Channing Tatum. Moose wants to major in electrical engineering, but he finds he that misses dancing, and soon enough, he runs into Luke (Rick Malambri), a street dancer who does a little filmmaking on the side. Moose goes off and spends the rest of the film struggling to juggle his academic life with his social life. Luke, meanwhile, lives with a group of nomadic street dancers in a loft/studio once owned by his parents, themselves aspiring dancers before their untimely deaths. Their way of life is threatened by both finances and a rival dance team, who are just plain mean. Into Luke's life enters Natalie (Sharni Vinson), who has great moves and thinks it would be a good idea for Luke to pursue filmmaking.

Would it surprise you to learn that everyone's future depends on winning a dance competition? If you can't see where the plot is going after ten minutes, especially if you've seen the first two films, then I suspect you would actually be surprised by the ending of a ""Titanic"" documentary or a biopic about Abraham Lincoln. This movie is contrived, clichd, and ultimately unfulfilling, since the ending and everything leading up to it are hopelessly predictable. The thing is, I can say the exact same thing about all the films; the people behind them are so intent on repeating themselves that it transcends mere routine and becomes a form of monomania. I'm pointing a finger directly at Adam Shankman and Jennifer Gibot, the only two producers to have been involved in all three films. We get it, guys. Dancing is important to you.

There is one particular scene in ""Step Up 3-D"" that actually held my attention all the way through. It featured Sevani and Stoner dancing up and down the streets of a New York City neighborhood while a remixed version of Fred Astaire's ""I Won't Dance"" blares from the speaker of an ice cream truck; it was all done in a single shot, and the two actors never missed a beat. It was a triumph of editing, choreography, and music. Why couldn't the rest of the film be like this? Maybe then, there would have been a good reason for it to have been made. The writers, directors, and producers of the ""Step Up"" series have told the exact same story three times in a row. How many more will it take for them to finally realize that they have exhausted an already hackneyed idea?",1281312000,4,5062,4.632516703786192

One of the first arguments I heard from the
naysayers against this new format is that 3D
adds nothing to the viewing experience. I am
about to prove those naysayers wrong.

When Disney contacted us asking if we were
interested in reviewing Step Up 3D I volunteered
knowing that I would be taking the hit for the
team.  After all, I don't fit the demographic for
this kind of film, nor up until moments ago did
I even know that this is the third in a series of
dance films geared towards teenage audiences.

In this installment we meet NYU freshman
Moose (Adam G. Sevani) who meets up with a
troupe of dancers known as the ""Pirates"" who
gather in a warehouse turned danceclub known
as the ""vault"" owned by an aspiring filmmaker/dancer
named Luke (Rick Malambri).

Got it so far?

Evidently, this NYU freshman has enough dance
potential to garner the interest of a rival gang
known as the ""The House of Samurai"" who challenge
""The Pirates"" to a series of dance events all leading
up to the coveted World Jam competition. It's important
that the Pirates win the $100,000 grand prize as the
bank moves to foreclose on their club.

While the film has lots of heart, the basic
storyline has been done hundreds of times before.
It's the same chewed on, spit-out garbage and
clichd dialogue you have seen time and time again.

However, that's not what you are here to watch
and fortunately the story quickly becomes secondary
to the film's real purpose -- DANCE!

Now here is where things really get hot...

Step Up 3D is an incredibly explosive dance
film that brings the 3D format front and center
to deliver powerhouse film experience.

There are amazingly choreographed dance
sequences set against beautiful backdrops of
neon and strobing lights.  Since the film was
conceived for the 3D format, it's cleverly
staged and photographed to dazzle and tickle
the viewers senses -- which it indeed succeeds
in doing.

What I really enjoyed most about the dancing
and the music is that all of it crosses an array
of genres and styles that include lots of breakdancing,
flips, contortions, head spinning and various
robotic-like movements.  But mixed within all
of that we get a bit of tango and even some Astaire.

Everybody is going to find a favorite style of
dance or music within the film's running time.
There are two dance numbers that I particularly
enjoyed:  The first being a Samurai dance number
set to a hyped-up remixed version of Frankie Vallie's
Beggin'.  A short time later, there's a wonderful
sequence shot on the streets of NY that features
Adam Sevani and Alyson Stoner dancing to a
remixed version of Fred Astaire's ""I Won't Dance.""
What's most inspiring about this scene is that it
was all done in one complete unedited shot.

What a better subject for 3D than dancing --
and the filmmakers have taken full advantage
of it by throwing body parts into the viewer's face.
If that were not simply enough,  every 3D enhanced
gimmick that could be thought of is readily used
including floating bubbles and balloons as well as
Icee chunks that jump out of the screen.  Some of
the most memorable ""In Yo' Face"" moments come
from the dancers themselves and their spastic-moving
hands that reach out towards you.

Since I have been so tuned to animation as of late
I have forgotten how good live action 3D can
look.  You could not have picked a better locale
for this film than New York City whose backdrop
is fully taken advantage of throughout. With an
incredible sense of depth between foreground and
back you can't help but look in awe at some of
the incredible city landmarks including the Brooklyn
bridge and a nighttime ride through Times Square.

Sadly, there are a lot of ghosting issues here.
The film mostly takes place in dark warehouse
settings with fast camera panning and quick
dance movements that often result in image
doubling or blurring.  It isn't nearly bad enough
to ruin the experience, but when it's present it
seems greatly exaggerated.

The image quality is perfect, more soft than
sharp, but not inhibiting the piercing array of
colors that almost constantly dazzle the eyes.
I even noticed rock solid black levels which I
usually don't pick up upon when watching 3D content.

The 3D disc features a DTS-HD 7.1 track.  I found
it to be first-rate even on my 5.1 system.  Crisp,
clear highs and boombastic bass levels that was
shaking the floor beneath my feet.  The surrounds
can be enveloping at times though mostly music-filled
rather than with effects or ambience.

The 3D release contains a terrific Disney 3D trailer
perfectly enhanced for the format which reveals that
""Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""Bolt"" is on the way.

However, that being said, they have a hideously
ineffective 3D logo that follows the trailer which
I hope the studio pulls in favor of something more effective.

CONCLUSION

Let me get back to the argument I talked about in
the first paragraph of this review.

Had I watched Step Up 3 in standard 2D, I don't
think I would be sitting here with this huge smile
on my face.  The filmmakers took a tired idea that
would probably have bombed in 2D but made fresh
by catering it for 3D.  What this does is give you an
entirely new perspective on what you are watching.
In this case, the result is one of the most enjoyable
live-action 3D titles I have reviewed to date.

This film will completely dazzle your senses.  Don't
be surprised to find your feet tapping away to the
music.  Once it's all over don't be surprised that
you'll want to revisit certain dance numbers over again.

Don't do what I did and judge a film by its cover.
Step Up 3D, while obviously geared towards teenagers,
will equally impress adults for its high-octane dance
choreography and demo 3D quality that is amongst
the best that is available to date.",1453075200,,5804,4.69101678183613

4121963,5,B003GAMN6K,I loved these movies,1439078400,,20,4.25
4121964,3,B003GAMN6K,"I admit I bought this soley for the 3D. I guess people who are really passionate about dancing, and teens are the main target for this audience; I'm neither of them. I would NEVER buy this for the cliche-galore story or just for seeing dancing. If you're like me and have a 3D home theater setup and became addicting to collecting 3D films, then I'm sure you're contemplating this film too.

I knew buying it and going into it that there wasn't going to be much of a story, but it really is laughably ridiculous. I guess teens would love it. You get the classic ""She's All That"" (do people still remember Freddie Prinze Jr and Rachael Leigh Cook? haha) moment 'You lied to me!!' 'No no... but I got to know you and it's different now!!' 'Get away from me!!' 'Oh no, I forgive you'. Let's just have a $100,000 contest where you get one random contestant to suddenly join it on the team and it's totally fine by everyone. Oh sorry, let's just enjoy the dances and be happy... let's break the ""best friends"" code and start kissing because that's a great way to end a movie with everyone kissing. Surprisingly, there was a F-bomb dropped in the film, which I found to be surprising in this kind of film, and felt like it just came out of nowhere.

The best 3D scene in this film has to be where they're dancing and splashing on the water.

3D is always best when they start using other elements like smoke or balloons flying off. They should have used balls or something to throw at the screen; incorporate more objects with their dances. (they use LED lights at the end, but it's nowhere near as impressive as the water splashing) Personally, I wasn't that impressed with the dancing itself and the final dance scene. The dancing in 3D actually doesn't look that great because it looks more like claymation stop-motion moving. There is the occasional gimmicky arms/hands towards the screen during the dances... When there's no interesting story and just simply dancing in 3D with no interesting obstacles, perspective, or objects, the 3D novelty starts to wear off.

I'm not a dancing fanatic, but I can appreciate when I see cool dancing like America's Got Talent's DM Nation (their synchornization is amazing!). The dancing in the film really didn't wow me, though.

Early in the beginning where they're driving in the car at night in New York is interesting to watch in 3D. I think seeing some first person parkour in the city would have made a great 3D experience.

I bought this because it was cheap for a 3D movie, but with that money spent, you could also invest it on and enjoy a much better quality film with better 3D experience too. If there's just one scene you want to demo to someone in 3D for this film, it's definitely the water splashing dance scene. Overall, there's a few okay 3D experience and laughable story you would expect to see on the Disney channel. If this film wasn't in 3D, I definitely wouldn't have finished it all the way or purchased it.",1438732800,,2968,4.548689138576779

It is not a great movie.  It is watchable though.  Good looking people dancing and pretty good use of 3D.  I know a lot of snobs think that 3D movies should just use 3D sparingly and subtly.  Not me-- I don't want reality I want the wow effect and have things pop out as much as possible.  Why not-- it's what separates us from the animals.  This has a lot of pop-out and unnecessary flailing of arms-- important stuff for a 3D movie in my opinion.  Movie snobs may feel differently.  Oh yea, plot is thin and predictable, acting is so-so, what did I like about this movie?  Oh yea, good 3D and good looking dancers.",1425168000,2,786,4.125827814569536

It's a dance movie so that's what you can expect to see here.  The 3d is very good in this film. It's mostly about depth , which is what 3d is  about after all.  SO on a 3d level this is very good.

4122502,4,B003GAMN6K,It is another good dance movie and I like how it has some of the original actors and actresses bu nothing is the same as the first few. I have to admit though I love how it was clear and didn't know how a dance movie would pull off 3D but nailed it perfectly!,1398729600,,259,3.814814814814815
4122503,5,B003GAMN6K,This movie is amazing. I would recommend it to anyone. Other than footloose it is the best dance movie I have ever seen. Way better than step up or step up 2.,1398729600,,158,3.96875

4122506,4,B003GAMN6K,"but it was so much better than I expected, that I'm intentionally overrating it. The 3D dance sequences are terrific, and the plot is serviceable, the cast charming. The little two-person, one-take dance homage to Fred Astaire's ""I Won't Dance"" alone is worth the price of the 3D Blu-ray. The movie is formulaic and B-movie-ish but if you keep your expectations low and sit close to enjoy the 3D, you'll get a kick out of it.

I haven't seen the other ""Step Up"" movies, so don't be concerned that you're dropping into the middle of a franchise. This one appears to be more of a spin-off than a continuation, so not having seen the previous films doesn't much matter. You're supposed to be surprised and thrilled when a team of cast members from the first couple movies shows up towards the end, and you know what? I was pleased by their heroic arrival even without knowing their back story. The final dance-off is awesome.

This is a 5-star 3D movie with a 2- or 3-star plot. But I recommend it for dance fans of all decades.",1398038400,,1025,4.505376344086022

If you love dancing, you'll enjoy this movie! All the actors/dancers are very talented, impressive with their moves and portray their characters well.

Also, the 3D is well done and makes the viewing experience all the more compelling.

OK, it's a pretty predictable plot, so don't focus too much on that. Just sit back and let the dancing move you.

By the way, I gave it a solid 4 out of 5 stars for sheer entertainment value only because I can't include it with all the really GREAT movies that deserve the maximum rating.

And if you like this movie, you'll like the sequel, ""Step Up Revolution 3D,"" as much or better (also a solid 4 out of 5 stars) -- for all the same reasons.",1394755200,,702,4.453125

The story, if you want to say it really had one, was really bland, bad & str8 out of an 80's throw back break dancing movie a la Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo meets an abc after school special. The acting was simplistic, unbelievable and corny.. and it's very hard to believe that with all that dancing, there's not one gay character... I mean, c'mon guys, know your demographics when making a movie such as this.. Because it was so Str8 laced and wholesome, I don't get the PG-13 rating on this one; there's no sex, no harsh language or violence, no sexual controversy which could upset anal retentive conservatives, no substance abuse. It's a mild PG at best... This film was a TV movie at best.",1330128000,,811,4.486486486486487

Yes, Step Up 3 is not for everyone, because it only caters to dance enthusiasts, like myself. It really doesn't bother me if the story is inadequate or the actors were lame, as long as the dance moves are off the hook!

4122921,5,B003GAMN6K,"Step Up Three, written by Amy Andelson, Emily Meyer, and directed by Jon Chu was an amazing movie. The movie is 107 minutes, not too long. This movie definitely fits its rating of pg13 because young children wouldn't find it interesting.

 Step Up Three is about a group of New York dancers, who team up with an NYU freshman to compete in a dance competition against some of the world's best dancers. They soon find out that dancing will change their lives. I really like the story line and the dancing was really cool. The soundtrack in this movie is fantastic(""Club Can't Handle Me"" - Flo Rida featuring David Guetta ,""My Own Step (theme from Step Up 3D)"" - Roscoe Dash and T-Pain, featuring Fabo, ""Already Taken"" - Trey Songz ,""This Girl"" - Laza Morgan , ""This Instant"" - Sophia Fresh featuring T-Pain ,""No Te Quiero (Remix)"" - Sophia Del Carmen featuring Pitbull,""Irresistible"" - Wisin y Yandel ,""Spirit of the Radio"" - Jrandall). All the songs had great beats and moved the plot along well.

The actors, Sharni Vinson, Rick Malambri, Adam G. Sevani, Alyson Stoner, and Keith Stallworth do a really great job in showing their passion for dancing. When it comes to the visual effects you can't compare them to the visual effects in the first and second Step Up. The lighting on the stages is by far better. The message appears at the end of the movie. What I learned from this movie is never give up on something you love to do for something you don't like to do.",1326240000,,1466,4.566539923954372
4122922,3,B003GAMN6K,"No one watches these movies because they think they're cinematic genius (at least, I hope not). While I thought the original had a decent plot and relatively well-developed characters, the third installment is more of a dance showcase thinly connected by a cliche plot. But since I really wanted to watch this for the dance elements, I was OK with that.

Solely viewed for the dance, this film is easily a 4-5 star film. As a film (with an actual plot and good characters) it's a one-star film (combining the two is where I got the three stars). I mean, honestly, you've seen this film before. Boy meets girl, falls for girl, girl has 'secret' (which you can guess from the get-go) that is revealed, crushing boy's heart. Girl comes through in the clutch and they lived happily ever after. This is essentially a rom-com with a dance twist.

But what a dance twist! The dancing is wonderful and Luke is very nice to look at (though he doesn't really do all that much dancing, which is a shame).

4122926,4,B003GAMN6K,"Forget the story line here, which is beyond stupid, and forget the acting, which is even stupider; just fast forward to the dance scenes.

These are mixed. Hollywood has a love/hate relationship with street culture and never seems to know whether to present it raw or smooth it up and digest it into 'professional' work.

Some of the more authentic hiphop pieces are amazing in their athleticism. And some of the produced pieces are first rate also. Adam G. Sevani is a super talented young guy; his takeoff on Fred Astaire's""I Won't Dance Don't Ask Me"" is one of the best dance performances in movies since Gene Kelly - his partner Alyson Stoner is almost as good.

On the other hand there are some faked up production numbers. The two main characters are replaced by dancer doubles in some places - easy to spot and jarring. In other places the frame rate of a dance sequence is artificially speeded up so it will appear more difficult than it is - obvious and a cheap trick.

So a mixture. But still a fun movie.",1324771200,,1015,4.530054644808743

The story is repetitive basically a bunch of kids need money and they enter a contest and so it goes but the dancing in this is what impressed me, not the story. I was happy to see ""Moose"" reprise his role. He's super cute! The main character (the guy on the cover) seemed to disappear whenever the real dancing happened which I thought was funny but the dance numbers were off the chain! The dancer that did the robot in the first part of the film was phenomanal. I've never seen someone move just like a robot like that! They also did a dance in water which was just like the second movie but it was a great dance sequence anyway. The final dance number was also outstanding with the lighted suits they were wearing. It was amazing! I found myself rewinding this movie to see the dance sequences again and again! I highly recommend this if you like dance movies.",1322265600,,923,4.341040462427745
4122944,3,B003GAMN6K,"Dancing has never been my thing. I'm just not cheery enough of a person to take a serious interest in an activity in which all committed participants are joyfully dancing and hopping around all - the - time. But hey, more power to them right? That's not me, but I kind of wish it was, you know?

Honestly the story serves as an excuse to show off some killer dance moves. You can tell these people work hard, and showing off that talent is the sole purpose of this movie. I don't take the drama seriously in the least--they all seem too cheery and bubbly to go to ""war"" with other dance troupes--but the moves are cool and the 3D probably takes the cake out of any other current live action BluRay 3D (barring Avatar maybe, and it's definitely better than RE Afterlife in terms of the 3D). A lot of the 3D is behind the screen and those shots all look real, like you're on set. The ""out of screen"" effects never seem forced either; they never seem like a pointless gag. Rather the few ""pop out"" effects that the director employs are more along the lines of ""holy crap that's awesome!"" when they are used. You never get sick of it, like you're being fed a gimmick. Usually it's a close up of a dancer, and it feels like you're right there in the crowd, like the guy/girl is trying to involve you in the show.

Bottom line: the script isn't amazing but it's not awful. Acting isn't the best but it's not horrid. The story is pleasant enough so that you're not hoping for the movie to end, and the dancing/3D filming are engaging enough to make you wish there was just a little bit more.

The 3D titles at the end susms it all up with vibrant colors, best pop out and dept effects. A few times the 3D is so real that you feel as if you are on the dance floor and you duck as the dancers jump towards you.

Other 3D movies I bought from amazon is ""Under the Sea"", ""Legends of the Guardians"", and ""Alice in Wonderland"". These movies had awesome 3D effect.

This Stepup movie 3D was by far the worst out of my 3D collection. I was tricked by other reviews saying the 3D in this movie was on par if not better than Avatar. Lies. Unless Avatar had sucky 3D! Maybe it's just me but I watched this entire movie almost cross-eyed. The 3D effect was maybe too strong? When it popped, it was too double imagey and it gave me a headache. There were moments in my other 3D movies in which I saw double but not this much. It was like the whole film and I wanted to watch the movie in 2D instead but the problem is I would be stuck with a crappy movie in 2D instead of 3D crap. Putting crap in 3D automatically makes it better normally. Not in this case.

So I'm stuck with a horrible movie with horrible 3D with the only redeeming value is the nifty 3D cover. I wish I could rent 3d movies from netflix.",1313625600,,1237,4.128630705394191

Step Up 4 is coming out...and I hope it doesn't blow it...but the trajectory has been on an upward climb...so I don't think so.

4122985,5,B003GAMN6K,"This is it! With every Step Up movie that comes out, it just gets better and better! This movie really could be its own movie and doesn't really need to connect with the first two movies. But still, it does connect in a way. In the last two movies, the main story was about a troubled young adult star that goes to a performing art school for high school. Then, through dance, he/she learns to have a better life and has a bring future.

In this movie there is more depth with the story. It's about a guy named Luke. He finds and leads a group of talented dancers to become a family of dancers all with their own unique style of dance. All these dancers want to make it big as dancers, but have no where to go to do that until Luke comes and lead them. Another new dancer that Luke finds is Moose and he is a return actor from Step Up 2. Moose doesn't know what he wants to do about dance because he is actually going to school as an engineering major. He then decides to join the group. Another dancer in the grop is Natalie. There a whole plot story with her but I don't want to spolier it for you and won't tell what that is. There still another of other things that I haven't talked about the movie yet, but instead you should watch it and enjoy it.

In this movie you will hear amazing music, and see hot dance moves! I really recommend this dance movie. It is easily the best and actually made the most money worldwide as well. There's a lot of great movie extras to see in the DVD/Blu-ray and was my mine reason why I bought it. :)

---Update---

I just finished watching Step Up Revolution.(A.K.A Step Up 4.) Let me tell you that it wasn't as good as the commercials made it out to be.

Step Up 3 is still my favorite Step Up movie of all time!!! The newest Step Up just didn't have enough interesting story, dance, or on screen chemistry as much as this film did.",1308355200,,1872,4.146005509641873

The second film was a bit too copycat like, but it was still exciting in ways and offered up some fresh new dance sequences.  This `3D' disaster is just completely uncalled for.  Offering a plot that is equal parts copycat and equal parts preposterously absurd, `Step Up 3D' overdoes the films initial objective to death and creates an unapologetically lame entry into a series that was, for the most part, quite fun.  The dance sequences utilize the 3D technology rather well, but I hate films that make it so obvious they are TRYING to be 3D.  Honestly, I'm waiting for this current craze to die down, since I don't feel like wearing glasses every time I go to the movies, and when a film is made to be seen as 3D in the manner that `Step Up 3D' is, it is almost a requirement.  Watching it at home without the glasses actually makes the film annoyingly obvious.  With that said, I found that too many of the films choreography was ripped from the second film, as well with a lot of the staging of those scenes, and the overall plot was so empty headed that it made watching it a chore.  I don't mind light hearted romps, but I hate stupid movies.  This movie is just stupid.  Oh, and what a waste of dancing talent.  How in the world could they delegate truly admirable dancers (who graced the `So You Think You Can Dance' stage) to mere supporting roles with no real highlight of their talent?  I mean, you make `So You Think You Can Dance' champ Joshua dress like a robot and dance in a public restroom?  That whole scene (not to mention the correlating video camera scene taking place in the club) was just ridiculous.  In fact, this whole movie is ridiculous.",1300924800,,1852,4.48955223880597

I watched my Avatar 3D Blu Ray one night and then watched this 3D Blu Ray the next night and I have to say that, IMHO, this movie wins hands down for 3D effect.  This movie literally was packed with jaw dropping 3D from start to finish! While Avatar is just plain visually stunning overall, Step Up 3D is without a doubt the BEST 3D Blu Ray I have watched to date.  Clearly movies originally shot in 3D are leaps and bounds above the rest.  When the girl wearing the red and black gloves was dancing it literally looked like she was IN MY LIVING ROOM!

It's a wonder it doesn't collapse in on its own pretension and turn into a black hole. And yet... I rather liked it. Oh, it's far from a great movie. But it has a certain amount of charm.

The plot, such as it is, centers around two rival dance troupes. They have silly names and call themselves ""houses"". One is lead by the handsome and charismatic Luke while the other is lead by the handsome and charismatic Julian. We know Julian is Eeeeevil because he wears black and has a sinister look about him. They take their dancing so seriously I kept having flashbacks to the ""South Park"" episode ""You Got F'd in the A"".

Into their world wanders a boy with the unfortunate nickname of Moose. Apparently he was in the other films, where I sincerely hope his nickname gets explained. He's played by Adam G Sevani, a very attractive, talented young dancer who gives the distinct impression of a gay person trying to play straight and falling short. He's cute and charming and very good at dancing.

He gets recruited into Luke's little dance troupe and we soon find out that Luke's home/rehearsal space is about to be foreclosed on. Thankfully there's a dance competition coming up soon and the prize is $100,000. It's astonishing to me that could possibly be enough to cover a mortgage on a large space in New York City, but whatever.

The plot goes from there with dancing, betrayal, dancing, romance, dancing and dancing, with only enough plot as needed to move the film forward. Really it reminded me of one of those porn films that pretends to have a plot when really all the audience wants is for the movie to do what it's meant to do. It's much the same here. I would have been far more interested in two hours of dancing footage and zero plot.

Speaking of the dancing, oh, goodness. Yes, it's quite impressive. It is what makes the movie worth seeing, and it really is worth seeing just for that. People do things I didn't know where physically possible. It was frankly astonishing what some of these people can do with their bodies.

But I do have an objection with much of the dancing. There's several scenes where we see dancing but it's so heavily edited it's very hard to tell exactly what's going on and to follow the action. That's a shame, because there's some real talent, but the camera doesn't take enough time to showcase it. This is less of a problem toward the end of the film, but it's a major issue at the start.

Ignoring that and the really, really stupid plot, this is a fun little movie. If you can just put your brain into neutral and coast along, you'll be just fine.",1297641600,,2778,4.510934393638171

Moose was awesome, as always, but there simply was too much useless dialogue and romance BS you see in every other movie. The end dance was the best, of course. The dance scenes were short though...

I will tell you why....it was pure fun. There was a decent story line, but the dance scenes (especially the guy who rocked the robot) to die for. Ok, now the plot of the film. An aspiring film maker (and dancer) is trying to save his home, which also happens to be the homes for several homeless dancers. Winning a competition will pay the bills and save the warehouse from foreclosure. He has a strong sense of obligation to the kids who live there and finds himself slightly distracted by a beautiful dancer who isn't what she seems. The other main character is a college student who is temporarily ignoring his best friend because of his overwhelming need to dance. The two (the film maker and the college student/dancer) have bonded based a solid friendship out of their love for the arts.

Why them do I give this campy yet charming movie a 5? It was pure fun. It's my opinion that the guy who did the robot scenes stole the show and the water (dance)  sequence  rocked. I also enjoyed the behind the scene stuff and extra videos. The story was easy to follow, and while not to original enjoyable, and the music was great and offered a wonderful escape from reality.

4123099,4,B003GAMN6K,"A young man arrives at NYU and he encounters a dance crew that needs to win a contest in order to maintain their living arrangements. Loud Hip-Hop music and street dancing punctuate this story of a college freshman trying to balance dance practice, with commitments to schoolwork and loyalty to his best friend. This is an entertaining romp if you like the loud pulsating beats of Hip-Hop.",1294790400,,389,4.82089552238806

My teenage son loves the Step Up series and absolutely loved this movie.  It is his favorite of the three movies and he's watched it 7 times in two weeks.  It comes with a regular DVD, a 3D DVD, a Blu-ray DVD and a digital copy.  You get a lot for your money with this combo.  Love it!",1294790400,,444,4.214285714285714
4123101,5,B003GAMN6K,"If you were turned off by Step Up, forget about it, the sequels are infinitely better. This movie is so good! One of the things that I love about it is that the dancers may be quirky or awkward in plot scenes, but when they'e dancing they are so powerful and confident, it's like they become superheroes (moose in particular).
Step up 3 makes the right decision to cut down on plot and drama and let the dancing take the spotlight. Yes there is a story, but it's not bogged down by disapproving parents or stodgy ballet instructors. Everyone starts out as good dancers so there aren't any unnecessary montages of bad dancers fumbling around (though there are some great training sequences of everyone showing off). The conflicts are sometimes so ludicrous it's hilarious. The acting is fine, these are fantasy people who live in beautiful colorful world where conflicts are settled with dance battles in the bathroom, they're charming and happy go lucky and I wouldn't want it any other way.
The dancing is amazing! There are so many styles and every dancer injects their own personality into it. The interactions between crews during battles were really interesting. They'll trade blows and react to each others moves and sometimes mock the other crews style. They really made an effort to resolve plot in the dancing instead of having plot and dancing separate. The choreography is stellar and the cinematography is significantly improved since Step Up 2. It's really bright and colorful and the contrast and framing allows for you to see all the intricacies of the choreography.  I particularly appreciated that the dancing can be flirty without being sexual or vulgar.

I just go through this movie with a huge grin on my face and the battles are great to watch over and over. I just can't get enough of this movie.

The only complaint I have is that I would like to have a commentary or more special features with the director talking about his process. He obviously loves and knows dance, and he is pretty vocal on the internet so I was surprised that he didn't talk more on the features.",1294358400,,2094,4.747252747252747
4123102,5,B003GAMN6K,VERY GOOD MOVIE. SOME AWSOME DANCING AND THE WAY THEY USED THE 3D FORMAT IS EXCELLANT!!! I JUST BOUGHT A NEW 3D SETUP AND THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT ON IT. BRINGS A WHOLE NEW WORLD TO HOME THEATER!! 5 STARS!!!!,1293753600,,204,4.125
4123103,5,B003GAMN6K,"OK so the story is simplistic. The acting is passable. However, the dancing is just great! And this is what makes the movie.

We just bought a 3D TV and Blu-Ray for Christmas and bought this 3D Blu-Ray the day it came out. Although the use of 3D is gimmicky at times, for the most part it was a great use of the format and some numbers like the ""Battle of GWAI"" had us clapping at the end of it, as did the last dance of the Finals (where the dancers were outfitted in LED lit suits). Overall The movie really benefits from being shot in 3D, and before the end credits began running our kids (7 and 9 YO) were out of their bean bag chairs and dancing in their best interpretation of the moves they just saw.

From the other reviews I knew the story was going to be simple, but the message is still there: follow your dreams no matter how improbable they are. Also, the story line was enough to keep me engaged with the characters and give the viewer a breather between dance routines.

For parents with younger viewers be aware that there is one f-bomb, one s**t, and a bull-s**t tossed out. But they come and go so quickly that it is hard to even realize what was said. My 9 YO, who usually picks up on words he has not heard before, didn't in this case. If it was not for the few swear words I am think the movie would have been classified as PG. Yes, there are intense dance ""battle"" scenes. But nothing scary or threatening (no knives or weapons). There are also skimpily clad dancers but actually less skimpy that what one would see on prime-time TV ABC's ""Dancing with the Stars"". There is fliting between the two main characters for about half the movie and a couple of kissing scenes (""Ewww, why did they have to show that"" said the 7 YO) but nothing more suggestive than that.

A couple of minor quibbles: for some in-explicable reason the 3D Blu-Ray does not have a scene selection option (the 2D Blu-Ray does). Also I am not sure I need the combo-pack. After watching the movie in 3D, 2D just does not compare. And if you have the Blu-Ray (2D and 3D) why would you need the DVD (I guess you can use it in the car). Like I said, just minor quibbles....

All-in-all a great showcase of dance and the 3D Blu-Ray format.",1293408000,,2227,4.25531914893617
4123104,5,B003GAMN6K,"I bought this for the 3D. It's one of the best, if not the best 3D blu-ray that I've seen. It's right up there with ""Open Season"", which is a bit different because it's animated. It's definitely the best non-animated 3D blu-ray that I've seen. The acting and plot are almost non existent. The dancing is phenomenal though. I'm not even a big fan of dance, and just bought this to watch a non-animation 3D blu-ray besides some stupid documentary. The dancing is extremely entertaining though. You can tell the film was shot with 3D in mind.

The setting is also perfect to showcase 3D. Since the film is based in New York the outside scenes offer incredible depth. Also, the brightness doesn't at all look too low as it does on many 3D blu-rays. I watched for a reduction in brightness the whole time and really didn't notice it at all. Ghosting also never seemed to appear. Both the outdoor and indoor scenes have a great level of brightness. The outdoor scene of Alyson Stoner and ""Moose"" dancing is an incredible showcase of 3D and the brightness and color palette are incredible. This 3D blu-ray is a must have in your collection. There are no special features in 3D, which was a little disappointing. The 3D quality of the film and the dancing made up for it though.",1293321600,31,1270,4.545851528384279
4123105,4,B003GAMN6K,"When the dancing is this electrifying, it's much easier to overlook the not exactly groundbreaking plot. I saw the movie trailer months ago and it was misleading in places. Sharni Vinson (who plays ""Natalie"") looks close enough to Briana Evigan from STEP UP 2 that I got tricked some. It ultimately didn't matter. The other thing you won't get from viewing the trailer is that the story isn't just about the two hot leads Sharni Vinson and Rick Malambri. The very likable, charmingly awkward Adam G. Sevani makes a welcome return as Moose, and this is just as much his story. Moose now attends NYU, majoring in engineering, his dance life very much in his rear view mirror. Except that last bit doesn't even last past his first day of college.

Moose inadvertently gets tangled up in a dance battle with a member of the House of Samurai... and beats the guy (the balloons may have been overdoing it). The police get caught up in the drama; Moose runs away from the cops, gets hooked up by a budding filmmaker named Luke (Malambri). Luke is one of them good dudes. He's barely hanging on to a warehouse which serves as a home and dance studio for a tight-knit crew of street dancers calling itself the House of Pirates. Luke is five months late on the warehouse payments. Even the warehouse's subbing as a night club isn't making ends meet. The one hope is for the Pirates to compete - and win - in the first ever annual World Jam, the prize money being $100,000. Luke recruits Moose. Luke also recruits Natalie (Sharni Vinson), this mysterious hot chick, because what's a movie without gorgeous dames causing trouble?

That's the plot, and it's predictable. But go with it. It's a platform for the phenomenal dance routines, which is what we came to see in a dance flick, anyway, right? Dramatically, really, only Adam G. Sevani and Alyson Stoner (""Camille"") come thru. Compared to the trifling, by-the-numbers stuff the two sexies, Vinson and Malambri, bring to the table, Sevani and Stoner's relationship feels more organic. You guys may remember Alyson Stoner as that standout kid featured in those Missy Elliott videos (Work It"" and ""Gossip Folks""). I wish she'd busted more moves here.

Some of the world's best street dancers gather. And unlike another sorta similarly-themed movie I just saw (FAME remake), STEP UP 3 sizzles with dynamic energy and flair and passion and sheer showstopping stuff. These kids got moxie busting out their ears. The Santiago twins are a hoot. Moose has got skills for a gawky kid. And Chadd Smith is amazing. In his cool shades, dude is like the Terminator if the Terminator made a hobby of doing the Robot. That sick neck drop he does (Moose does it too) in the finals had me out of my seat yelling ""What the f-!"" But the film stretches beyond the pop & lock and the breakdancing, the krumping and the capoeira influences. Vinson and Malambri perform a sensual tango to Jazmine Sullivan's ""Bust Your Windows."" And in one of the film's sweetest moments, Sevani and Stoner pay homage to the really old school, as they dance in the streets while that ice cream truck plays Fred Astaire's ""I Won't Dance.""

And if you liked STEP UP 2: THE STREETS, then there's really one cool surprise in store.

In the finals, I loved the ""Here come the Pirate shorties!"" bit. But the LED costumes, I thought, were a bit much. The Pirates shouldn't have needed props. Their skills alone were enough to go to battle with. The Pirates were - to quote Luke - ""born from a boombox.""",1293148800,3,3497,4.670454545454546
4123106,5,B003GAMN6K,"A Review of the 2D Blu-Ray:
I don't have a 3D player, but I intend on getting one when the prices of 3D Player, TV, and Glasses lower in price. When you can get a pair of cheap 3D glass for about $30 and when the player becomes less than $150 and when they sell the TVs for a low price at Big Lots, but now on to the movie. The movie is amazing, not the plot or the acting, but the dancing is just awesome! It's just so much fun to watch. It's one movie than can be watched and lots of fun to watch. Really enjoyable, just as good as I expected. This is the BEST Step Up movie that has released so far. The music is really good too.

3D Theatrical:
The 3D effects were great! Has to be one of the best 3D effects, I've seen. Yogi Bear is also good in 3D btw. If you didn't seen it in 3D, that was one of the best ways to experince the movie. It actually felt like you were there watching them dance! It was amazing.

The 3D Blu-Ray and DVD do NOT contain special effects, only on the 2D Blu-Ray.
Digital Copy included.

A+
Must See.

NOTES: Can't wait to see Step Up 4 in 3D.",1293148800,2,1075,3.8727272727272726
4123107,5,B003GAMN6K,"You know how sometimes when you watch a sequel, you can't help but compare it to the original and think that the first one was so much better?  Step Up 3 is the exception to that rule.  Yes, it is the third movie in a series but it really could stand alone.  The plot is intriguing, the passion between the main stars is too hot for words and the dancing is unbelievable!  I don't normally watch movies more than once, especially in only a few days time and I've already watched Step Up 3 four times!  That's a new record for me.  I watched the regular DVD first and then watched the Blu-ray version and there was a huge difference!  The picture quality is so much better on Blu-ray and the screen seemed to come to life.  I enjoyed this movie so much and it would make a great gift for the holidays!

One of my favorite features on this DVD is the music videos.  I put them on while I'm cleaning the living room and it makes the chore so much more enjoyable.  I catch myself dancing around the living room (not nearly as well as the dancers in Step Up 3 but I have a lot of fun anyway).  My second favorite feature is the documentary because it gives you new perspective and adds little details that are really enjoyable for the viewer.",1292976000,18,1237,4.217021276595744
4123108,4,B003GAMN6K,"In 2006, the dance/romance film ""Step Up"" was born and it was a box office success with a budget of $12 million, ""Step Up"" would bring in $114 million worldwide.

So, with the financial success of the first film, it was not surprising that a sequel  in 2008 titled ""Step Up 2: The Streets"" would be made and directing the film would be dancer and filmmaker John Chu (""Silent Beats"", ""When the Kids Are Away"", ""Justin Bieber: Never Say Never"").  Like its predecessor, the film would make a lot of money and surpass the first film by bringing over $148 million.

And in 2010, John Chu returned as the director but this time bringing the third film to the big screen in 3D and to keep continuity with the first two films, ""Step Up 3"" would bring back actress Camille Gage (Alyson Stoner) from the first film and Adam Sevani (Moose) from the second film as new students at New York University.  And once again, like the previous two films, shot with a budget of $30 million, the third film would rake in $159 million worldwide.

And now, ""Step Up 3"" arrives on Blu-ray and DVD on December 21st.  On Blu-ray, there will be two versions available, ""Step Up 3"" will be released in 3D (for those with 3D enabled Blu-ray players and TV sets) and normal Blu-ray on Blu-ray and DVD.

""Step Up 3"" is a film that focus on three-related storylines.  The first focuses on the friendship between Moose (played by Adam Sevani) and Camille (played by Alyson Stoner, ""Camp Rock"" films, ""Phineas and Ferb"").  The two have grown up with each other and now both will be attending New York University.  Because the two are best friends, they want to enjoy their life as students together and are often mistaken as a couple.

Moose loves to dance but he promised his parents (who is putting a lot of their money into their son's education) that he will focus on his engineering degree.  But on the first day of student orientation, he accidentally gets himself dragged into a dance battle and humiliates Kid Darkness, one of the premiere dancers of the House of Samurai Dance Crew.

Meanwhile, as he is dancing, he is being taped by a guy named Luke, who happens to be the leader of a dance crew known as ""The House of the Pirates"".  Luke and his group want Moose to join them and be part of the House of Pirates and prepare for the World Jam Dance contest.  And because he humiliated Kid Darkness, he will become a target of the House of Samurai Dance Crew.

Despite telling himself he wants to quit dancing, dancing is too much of a passion for Moose that he joins the House of Pirates but his friend Camille is unaware of why her best friend is ditching her all the time and is saddened that the promise they made of being together is not being fulfilled.  Also, how will Moose deal with college when the crew expects him to be training for the dance competition during his classes?

The second storyline features the character of Luke (played by Rick Malambri, ""Surrogates"", ""Universal Soldiers"").  A filmmaker and the leader of the House of Pirates.  He also owns the building/warehouse which houses the dancers of the House of Pirates and as a promise to his dead parents, he wants to keep the building open.  So, people can train to dance and have a place to hang out and party.  But the building's rent has not been paid for six months and is in danger of closing.  And so the motivation for his dancers are to win the $100,000 grand prize to keep the warehouse open and they know they need more dancers for the competition to take on their rivals, the House of Samurai.

The third storyline focuses on Luke and a dancer that he has fallen for.  Her name is Natalie (played by Sharni Vinson, ""Home and Away"") and he has been attracted to her for quite awhile.  He gives Natalie a place to stay and the two grow closer together and eventually fall for each other.  With the addition of Moose, Natalie also joins the House of Pirates.  But what Luke doesn't know is that Natalie is the sister of Julien (played by Joe Slaughter), the leader of the House of Samurai and Natalie was sent by him to spy on the House of Pirates dance crew.  But can Natalie hurt the House of Pirates after she has grown close to them and has become one of them?  Can she hurt Luke now that she has fallen in love with him?

VIDEO:

""Step Up 3"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1) and the first thing that came to my mind is how vibrant this film looks.  From the various shots of New York City to the use of color featured in the film, I was pretty impressed by the overall look and set design.  In the film, there is an interesting use of light and costume design and CG work which I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't watch the film.  A little TRON-esque but I was digging it!

There is a lot of detail that is seen from the building sets, the closeups of the Nike vintage shoes to the characters and more.  I did notice some occasional banding on scenes where there was a lot of red.  But for the most part, picture quality is pretty fantastic and I noticed no blemishes, artifacts, combing, crush, etc.  Blacks were nice and deep and colors just pop!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Step Up 3"" features an English 7.1 DTS-HD (48 kHz/24-bit) lossless soundtrack.  Also, presented in French and Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1.  Dialogue and music is crystal clear and for low frequency, although not an action film, it's definitely a film that is driven by its music from Flo Rida (feat. David Guetta), Trey Songz, Jay-Z and Alicia Keys, Sofia Fresh (feat. T-Pain), Wisn y Yandel and more.  Bass is continually pumpin' and you could hear the resonance through your subwoofers when you hear that LFE.  Because of the 7.1 track, there is also use of surroound and rear surround throughout the film.

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When it comes to dancing films, I know that there are film critics who just can't get into them.  But for me, I absolutely enjoy watching the choreography of these films and seeing how far they can take it to the next level.

For me, the ""Step Up"" and ""Stomp the Yard"" films are known for their choreography and the plots are typically hit or miss with the viewer.  For ""Step Up 3"", I absolutely enjoyed the film, its plot, the music and the choreography.  Having friends who are part of the dancing scene, the dance battles and also into collecting those special edition, vintage Nike shoes, I enjoyed the integration of it into this film.  But while the dancing and the battles are a constant theme of these films, ""Step Up 3"" is a pretty stylish film.

I have to admit that at first, seeing Rick Malambri as the male star of the film, I felt he was too clean cut for someone to be part of street dancing.  Someone you would see as more fashion model than someone who would lead a dance crew but everything worked out quite well.  Especially since the film incorporates so many characters, it helps when you have returning characters like Adam G. Sevani and Alyson Stoner as part of the film and the addition of Australian actress Sharni Vinson was quite interesting because similar to Rick Malambri, the first things that cross your mind is ""can these two dance?"".  And sure enough, both pulled it off.

Also, it helps by by surrounding the two talents with a plethora of dancing talent and according to director Jon M. Chu, over 250 talented dancers were part of this film and these dancers are among the top dancers in the world.  So, if anything, these dancers help compliment the talent and also because of the additional dance talent, we are seeing various styles of dancing being incorporated to this third film that we haven't seen in the previous two films.

And in many ways, I like the ""So You think You Can Dance"" style of mentality brought to this film by bringing these talent known for a certain style of dancing and then getting to learn various styles of choreography and each of these talented individuals have pulled it off.  The dancing of this film is phenomenal and for those who are passionate about dancing, I wouldn't be surprised if they rewind and play various scenes over and over and be in awe by it.

As for the overall plot, yeah...there is a banality to it.  Goals to win contest money to save a club, to save one's hide.  Lover's betrayal and one being too occupied with other things and not being there for love ones.  Yeah, it's been done many times before but it works for this film.  Adam G. Sevani and Alyson Stoner have great chemistry and they bring in a young and enjoyable vibe to this film.  While Malambri and Sevani bring the more sexual and romantic aspect to the film.

Also, I loved the cinematography and bringing that New York vibe to this film.  Also, loved how the colors were utilized and it's a vibrant film that really looks great on Blu-ray!  And of course, the music is pretty awesome.  From the characters of Luke and Moose traveling through New York with Jay-Z and Alicia Keys ""Empire State of Mind"" blaring through your front channel speakers to Flo Rida and David Guetta playing during a pretty cool dance scene and there are many more scenes with cool music, awesome choreography and memorable moments.

The Blu-ray release has pretty awesome PQ and the music is more of the dominant factor for audio, while dialogue and music is crystal clear, there is some usage of the surround and rear surround channels.  But it's the music that dominates the soundspace.  Also, there are good number of special features that feature more dancing scenes and dancers that were cut out of the film due to pacing and making the scenes flow.

As mentioned, there are two versions of this film being released on Blu-ray.  For those with a 3D Blu-ray player and 3D enabled television, you can purchase ""Step Up 3D"".  While those who don't have the 3D hardware or don't care for 3D can purchase the Blu-ray and DVD version of the film.

Overall, I know that dance films are not for everyone.  But for those who love street dancing, ""Step Up 3"" is a pretty enjoyable film and the choreography was phenomenal.  If you enjoyed the previous two films, I definitely recommend ""Step Up 3"".",1292976000,11,11492,4.538648517258143
