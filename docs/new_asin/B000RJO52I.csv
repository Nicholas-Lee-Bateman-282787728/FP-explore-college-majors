Poor Jason, but he N real wife Samantha Bee are actually great.  It's a piece of crap film but mandatory for wannabe actors.  I might watch it again but I better be drunk or stoned.  Dave Foley is always great.  Only 2 **s.....no more than that.",1460937600,,360,4.378787878787879

8201073,5,B000RJO52I,"As many readers know, I'm a critical diva who has much that I can point to as being bad.  I'm not doing that here.  This movie was hilarious!  I was rolling all the way through it.  You know how ""Fargo"" was funny because the characters had no idea how silly their actions were?  This film works in the same way.  A shocker is that the guys on the cover only meet each other once.  If Canadians can make films this funny, they gotta bring that stuff south of their border more.  You all have seen how funny it is when bad singers try out for ""American Idol""?  Imagine bad actors thinking they will survive in that field.  I love fat men and chin dimples, so I also loved the chubby guy (who reveals some flesh at the end) and the chin-dimpled man.  My only critiques are that there were no foreign language subtitles or scene selections.  Yes, you had to watch the whole thing or do a bunch of fast-forwarding.  Otherwise, I wish these actors much success.  This is a gem and it deserves much more attention and praise.  Simply excellent!",1205539200,2,1037,4.356020942408377
