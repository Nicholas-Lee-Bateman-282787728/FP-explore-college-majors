All the other battle movies in this series are remarkably good- not 'Gods and Generals"" to be sure, but well staged and somewhat realistic. In this film the re-enactments are less realistic and far more boring than watching some 8 year olds playing at war. Buy it for a discussion of the battle not to be moved.at all.",1233446400,,644,4.8108108108108105
