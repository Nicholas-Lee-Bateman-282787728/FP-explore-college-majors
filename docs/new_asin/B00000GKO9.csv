7909153,5,B00000GKO9,"Archie Bunker's take on politics is front and center in this trio of episodes from ""All in the Family.""  In ""Archie and the Editorial"" (Episode #38 September 16, 1972), Archie is incensed by a local station's position on gun control and tapes a rebuttal editorial of his own.  Archie clashes with Mike in ""Writing the President"" (#2 January 19, 1971), when he refuses to let a Commie Pinko letter attacking the Vietnam War be sent from his house.  Finally, in ""Man in the Street"" (#24 December 4, 1971), Archie's views on the world are again going to be aired for the enlightenment of his fellow citizens, but his beloved television set is not working.  As always, the performances by the late Carroll O'Connor show us why Archie Bunker was one of the greatest characters in television history.  His gun control editorial alone is worth the price of this tape.  The episodes remind us why ""All in the Family"" was one of the most influential shows as well.",993340800,2,955,4.688622754491018
