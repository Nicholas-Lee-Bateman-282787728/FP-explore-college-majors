UPDATE:  I see the the ad description has been updated, now showing:  Transcription for Wind Instruments.  Finally, after many years!

The Stabat Mater by Rossini is one of the most, or should I say THE most, tuneful and accessible sacred works ever composed.  One need not know it, but the text is concerning Mary's weeping over the body of Jesus.  You wouldn't know if you weren't told--the music works either way.  It is gorgeous and engaging from beginning to end.

As of October 2016, amazingly there are still no 'legitimate' performances (with chorus and vocal soloists) of the Rossini Stabat Mater on commercial DVD.  There are a few videos on YouTube, but none of them released on DVD.  This is the closest thing available.  Of course, there are plenty on audio CD.  First you will want to get the one with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cecilia-Bartoli/dp/B000V990T2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cecilia Bartoli</a>;  then you will become a Stabat Mater addict, and you'll have to get every recording ever made, one by one.

This is a transcription for large wind ensemble (looks like at least a dozen players), with no singers.  The arrangement is by Rossini himself, done in 1842, one year after the original version was completed.  Although it is not advertised that way, and it comes as a surprise ... it WORKS.  Try it out.  (Note, the album cover does not show this group.  It is much larger, there are no violins or piano.  It is straight winds.)

It's a live performance so there are a few little flubbasauruses here and there that could have been fixed in studio, but such is the joy of a live performance.  I prefer a live performance and frankly, I'm surprised they did as superbly well as they did.  I hope the reader will know it's more difficult to play wind instruments perfectly than any other kind.

The sound and video are both excellent.  It is a live performance in a historic sacred venue.  There is an audience present but they are entirely unobtrusive.

Several of the other reviewers stated there is no conductor, contrary to labelling.  Actually a conductor does not have to stand and wave a stick.  The conductor is clarinetist Corrado Giuffredi who gives motions and cutoffs with his instrument while playing.  And I am sure he carefully prepared the group in advance.  To say there is no conductor, or that he is not conducting, is incorrect.

OK, so forgive the labelling issues that need to be forgiven, and ... ENJOY!",1477612800,,2589,4.969626168224299
7899590,5,6305837279,"From reading the other reviews you will know the big surprise about this performance:  that it's not the choral version of the Stabat Mater, but rather a transcription made by Rossini himself in 1842(?).  And you're not going to like this very much unless you're a great fan of the Stabat Mater, or a great fan of chamber music, or both.
But if you are, this is a real gem, and you *must* listen to it -- you will be absolutely amazed.
First, the ensemble is certainly unusual:  two clarinets, one flute, two oboes, two trumpets, two french horn, one valved trombone, two bassoon, one contrabassoon, one bass clarinet.  How did he come up with that??  The textures coming from combining these instruments are strange and wonderful:  a trumpet and clarinet doing the duet in Quis est homo, vocally done by a soprano and mezzo was especially odd -- pairings of french horns and bassoons, flute and bassoon, all kinds of things you're not likely to hear in orchestral music nor in more conventional chamber music.
Another cool thing is that the ensemble plays without a conductor, meaning you get to see the interplay between the musicians, and also the solo aspect of the performance, as there are no doubled parts.  (And for that reason I disagree with a previous reviewer that the video is unnecessary -- I found it riveting.)
Bottom line on this one:  unless you're pretty hardcore, you ain't gonna like it.  But if you like the Stabat Mater you're gonna love it, and if you're a chamber music fan you should first get a choral version of the piece and learn it really well, so you can marvel at what Rossini did in setting his own vocal and choral lines in the context of a truly inspired chamber ensemble.
Oh, one last thing.  The musicianship is of the very highest caliber.  It's worth the price of the DVD just to watch the solo bassoon at work!  And the brass players play with remarkable restraint:  how can two trumpets, two horns and a trombone keep from drowning out the rest of the ensemble thoroughly?  Quite tastefully, it turns out.",981504000,4,2047,4.6187845303867405
7899591,1,6305837279,"This DVD is a great disappointment in that the work is played only by a 14 piece woodwind and brass ensemble. It is SO boring that even after two attemps to play it through, I have yet to finish it! I must confess that  I'm not familiar with this work by Rossini so don't know exactly what  instruments it was scored for, but regardless of that, it's one of the most  uninteresting classical music performances I've yet come across. Just  recently I bought the region 2 DVD of Andrea Bocelli singing Sacred Arias.  On that disk are two pieces from this work which are played by a string  orchestra AND sung by a choir. These performances are TOTALLY awesome and  are an eye-opener as to how it should possibly sound. I'm not sure if this  Bocelli DVD is available in NTSC region 1, but if it is, then this landmark  recording will be worth every cent you may have to pay. I recommend you go  for that one rather than this.
Technically the disk is only average with  the contrast being a little too high and the colours a bit washed out,  requiring the contrast and colour settings on the TV to be adjusted to  compensate. The Dolby 5.1 sound is crisp and clear even though the sound as  stated on the cover should only be Dolby Surround or stereo!",963705600,2,1247,4.3652173913043475
7899592,2,6305837279,"The title of this release would lead you to expect a performance of  Rossini's Stabat Mater as he scored it: soprano, alto, tenor and bass  soloists, chorus and symphony orchestra (led by a conductor). What you  actually hear is an arrangement for a small wind ensemble - no singers,  and, despite the citation, no conductor. This wonderful piece is made far  less interesting by such a reduction. Besides, the performance is pretty  ragged. Unless you are unusually enthusiastic about wind ensembles, you  should save your money.",962582400,3,530,5.093023255813954
7899593,4,6305837279,"I am not giving five stars to this magnificent recording because of the complete lack of informa- tion in the DVD box. This is not the sung Stabat Mater that anyone would have expected but an 1847 insrumentation for winds.  There is nothing about this on the box. A brief history of this version  would have been necessary. In the box, the sections (chapters) are wrongly  printed, since Chapter One should be ""Stabat mater dolorosa"" and  not ""Cujus animam"". In the recording, the chapters  numbers and  the time are not recorded, so you never know what part is being played  because this is not a sung version.  But what a pleasant disappointment!  Even if the concert took place in a minor basilica with nothing much to  show, like the other concerts of this series, the sound recording is so  brilliant and this version is so faithful to the original that by the end  of the first section one could al- most hear the voices of the singers.  This is a very beautiful and important recording of an un- kown version of  this very well loved Rossini mas- terpiece, perhaps the most famous of all  musical settings of the Stabat Mater, the sequence for the mass for Friday  for Passion week or Sorrows Friday.",961891200,6,1207,4.596244131455399
