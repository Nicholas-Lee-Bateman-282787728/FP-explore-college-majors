8403524,4,B003RCJRUW,"The Deposition Preparation DVD gives layperson witnesses a better idea of what to expect during their respective depositions.  Recently, my office had three witnesses to prepare for depositions.  All three of them received the DVD, other written materials concerning deposition preparation and direct instructions by counsel.  Two of them reviewed the DVD and otherwise did their homework to prepare.  The third did not, purportedly choosing instead to just tell the truth and not to prepare.  Not surprisingly, the two who did their homework including viewing the DVD did exceptionally well.  In contrast, the one who did not bombed!  While the production values and the attorneys and other legal professionals featured in the DVD are not Hollywood grade, on balance the Deposition Preparation DVD proved itself an excellent tool in the witness prep toolbox.",1369699200,,859,5.413533834586466
