The director obviously sat the whole crew down and made them all watch Snatch several times over before starting to film Crazy Stone. The way the film is cut, the intricate and interlaced plotlines all pay homage to Snatch. However, it is still a unique film! This is not cockney London, it is China... and Crazy Stone is full of fine detail on Chinese culture and thinking. If you have ever been to China or Hong Kong, you will see what I'm talking about... Just watch it, you will not be disappointed!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snatch-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000093FLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snatch (Widescreen Edition)</a>",1303776000,3,808,5.3203125
