4977503,2,B00687XNVM,"i want to like films like this one.  it's an indie film made by a woman, about a woman, starring a woman. the story itself is compelling - providing a realistic portrayal of a young woman's post-graduate aimlessness.  but the acting and directing are so very bad that it is painful to watch.  jemima kirke, who plays charlotte, is the only actor that does justice to her/his character.  undergraduate film students are exhaustingly self-indulgent and self-centered.  portraying these characteristics in a film is realistic. wallowing in these characteristics as a film maker is immature.",1324944000,15,587,5.202127659574468
4977504,3,B00687XNVM,"I FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN THE CRITERION BLU RAY.  THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE MOVIE ITSELF.  I PUT IT OUT HERE, BECAUSE I THINK SO FEW PEOPLE HAVE HEARD OF IT OR KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  TO THOSE WHO THINK WRITING A REVIEW FOR A PRODUCT THAT ISN'T OUT YET IS ""BAD""...I APOLOGIZE.

Aura has just finished college in Ohio.  Her major is Film Theory.  Her boyfriend of 3 years has broken up with her, however.  With no job prospects and no love life, she returns to the NYC home of her mother and her gifted younger sister Nadine.  She spends a lot of time moping and she half-heartedly restarts a friendship with the far perkier, but clearly spoiled and selfish Charlotte.  She takes a low paying job as a day hostess.  She half-heartedly dates a Youtube star she meets at a party and she half-heartedly flirts with a good-looking but attached chef at her restaurant.

Aura is utterly aimless...and it is her aimlessness that is the focus of director/writer/star Lena Dunham's TINY FURNITURE.  It's a very low-budget film that depicts lots of listless young people doing a lot of whining, navel-gazing and engaging in sharp-edged banter.  The movie shows us a very tiny little particular sub-culture of humanity (bored, over-educated, under-employed New York City residents with artistic pretensions).  It feels very real and specific...yet the people we meet are extremely aggravating.  Some will find them actively upsetting. I found most of them to be beneath getting worked up about...but just low-grade annoyances.  And absolutely NOT people I'd want to spend time with.

Aura makes mistakes with both men...but neither of them was right for her anyway.  She irritates the heck out of her successful artist mother and has a volatile relationship with her high achieving and oh-so superior teenage sister, who seems to have the drive her intelligent but aimless older sister lacks.  She drives away one ""good"" friend and spends too much time with a ""bad"" friend.

As I write all this, I realize it makes the movie sound darn near unwatchable.  This is not true.  Dunham has crafted some very funny dialogue for her characters...and to her credit, the witty remarks actually sound like something these people might say.  They are so full of disdain for the world around them, but clearly feel the lack of belonging to that world.  The Youtube artist that Aura spends some time with has become ""famous"" because he's made a series of videos depicting himself riding on a rocking horse while reciting Nietzsche.  This has gotten him an agent and some appointments with producers in NYC.  Yet it's also earned him no money, and he's essentially homeless in the city while making his rounds.  Aura has a degree in film theory, a very passive degree indeed.  Not in film production...theory.  God forbid she should actually MAKE something.  These modest plot turns and observations make TINY FURNITURE some fun to watch.

Dunham does an amusing job playing a character that I sincerely hope is not much like her.  She has no shame as an actress...she spends much of the movie lying around her house in a shirt and panties, with her hair unkempt.  She just can't make an effort to be presentable...even when she goes out, she appears to deliberately wear unflattering clothing.  She has cast her real-life mother as her movie mother and her real life sister as her movie sister.  Both performers are okay, but nothing great.  But it's amusing see the physical similarities and differences.

TINY FURNITURE is a tiny film (reported budget is $45,000).  While only 98 minutes long, it drags in places.  Nothing much happens, and next to nothing is resolved.  But it's got some wit and a good control of tone.  I'm certainly impressed enough to at least be interested in seeing what Dunham does next.  This is not a movie for everyone.  If you shy away from ""indie"" or ""quirky""...stay far away.  But if you're always looking for something new(ish) and offbeat, I think you'll find at least a few satisfying nuggets here.",1322524800,49,4022,4.834310850439882

4977521,4,B00687XNVM,"Tiny Furniture is a difficult film to rate. It follows the life of a fairly uninteresting and unattractive girl after she graduates from college. She is a bit of an entitled brat, yet she is mostly just a sweet, totally un-intimidating young lady struggling to find out who she is. Most of the characters, if not all of them, are on the unlikeable side, and there is no real character development at all from Aura. So what keeps Tiny Furniture from being an intolerable piece of self-indulgent garbage? It's Lena Dunham's excellent sense of realism that makes these character's and their actions fascinating. The performances and flawed nature of all of the actors are so believable, and the fact that Tiny Furniture is essentially a staged and scripted Lena Dunham documentary allows the audience a kind of voyeuristic satisfaction in watching this mixed-up girl so intimately and awkwardly. This could be seen as a lack of creativity on Lena's behalf, but it's engaging and that's all that really matters. That being said, it is very easy to understand those who condemn the film as being 100 minutes of boring first-world problems. It really boils down to whether or not the viewer makes a connection with the material. If there's a spark, it could turn into a fire, but if the first 20 minutes are unrewarding, the last 80 are likely not to be either. On the technical side, the film is flawless. Characterized by a stationary, wide-lensed camera, it is shot with the kind of precision that Wes Anderson displayed in his debut, Bottle Rocket. The photography is beautiful, however, it would be nice for at least a little variation, maybe a tracking shot here or there. The production design is nice (although the majority of the film was shot in her mother's pre-designed loft), and the music is suitably 'indie', not too exciting. Following in the college-educated, OCD-ridden footsteps of Woody Allen and his disciples, Lena Dunham isn't very original, and on the surface, she doesn't seem to have much going for her, but her charm lies in both the down-to-earth, not too quirky writing and the work of her talented cast.",1402358400,,2127,4.862258953168044

4977524,2,B00687XNVM,"Girls is amazing! But this was pretentious s***. I hate to say it because I love lena dunham, but there was very little plot development, none of the characters were likable.  The acting was horrendous and confusing.  I felt nothing for any of the characters.  Its about a rich snobby pretentious unlikable family in NY. It falls short.  Sure the cinematography is great, but with out a good stort line or script to back it up, it just leaves you rolling your eyes at the shallow, ""challenges"" Aura faces and her annoyingly petty responses. Maybe if you are also a wealthy NY recent college graduate with the maturity and depth of a 12 year old you will find this relatable and entertaining, but anyone outside of that demographic is likely to just be annoyed by all of the characters who seem to have no real ""character""",1395273600,,821,4.602739726027397

4977526,1,B00687XNVM,"bleh a lot of the criticisms people make about this flick are true. Pointless mumble-core, typical privileged millennial angst BS, annoying characters that you can't empathize with yep. It's all of that. And maybe it's appropriate that it strikes the stereotypical 'millennial' chord of apathy. It's not bad, but it's really not good, either. It has some things going for it, and it shows some potential in Dunham, but in aggregate the good things don't amount to anything of substance, and overall it's pointless. I'd love to try and hear someone explain the ""message"" to me. That would be far more entertaining than the film itself. More than anything else, the thing that upsets me about this film is that it's not significant in any way, yet it seems to somehow get praised. As much as I despise ""Girls"", I can at least admit that it is entertaining (at times), and seems to be building towards something. This is just a waste of time, and isn't worthy of accolades, like admission into the Criterion Collection. I'd much rather they had put out Michael Bay's ENTIRE filmography than this tripe.",1394841600,7,1099,4.8201058201058204
4977527,3,B00687XNVM,"Diehard Lena Dunham fans will love this, because she saturates the movie from beginning to end.  There are fun characters and it's an impressive first attempt, especially for somebody so young, but she's just way too annoying, charmless, self-absorbed and mediocre (as an actress) to have to endure her in every scene.  I found it hard to watch, and grating. I also find it hard to buy the situations she gets herself into. She simply does not have the charisma to make this believable. And who the hell walks into a party scene wearing nothing but underpants and a shirt? It's almost like she's daring the audience to mock her or critique her. We get it, you're chubby and carefree and wacky and unconventional--no sale, sorry. A likable and unique actress like Merritt Wever could have pulled this off beautifully.

This was like watching someone's college movie... which, to her credit, it kind of was.

Having said that, Dunham does have some great insights and clearly has a sense of humor. I'm sure that once she's worked out her issues and proved her point to herself (""I'm popular! I'm unique! I have no body issues!"") and learns to stay behind the lens and think outside the box, she will produce much more promising work.",1394582400,,1231,4.738317757009346

4977532,2,B00687XNVM,"Honestly, if you want something worth watching, check out Hal Hartley's stuff from the late 80s/early 90s. That's what I feel Dunham is trying to channel here, but she falls short. Watch the real stuff where you'll at least get story.",1392595200,,234,4.7317073170731705
4977533,2,B00687XNVM,"I was extremely excited to watch this movie ever since I heard it discussed on NPR. The director and lead actress is a young woman who just got out of film school and on the merit of this film she got wide release by a successful director and also a deal with hbo to produce a series. I am sad to say that either there must be a generation gap because I found this comedy to be extremely boring and not to my taste. The movie is in the category of mumblecore and if you're not familiar with the term its because it is a fairly new invention that was coined in 2003 for a category of films that are hard to describe but is in the vain of seinfeldesque comedy placed in odd situations but for those that are in it seem quite the norm. They are usually low budget and mostly based on dialogue but contains either very little plot or simple plot. They seem to speak more about the current generation: their aimlessness and futility , like 90s films with parker posey or wynona rider did for me. Anyway the humor in this movie is to be found in the main characer who moves home from college, mom is famous photographer of tiny furniture, falls for a guy who is you tube famous for spouting nietche philosophy while riding a toy pony, she does you tube video of her fat self in college fountain, invites guy to live in moms house who overstays welcome, hangs out with high school friend who has a fake british accent from being in england for one year. The shame of it is it has all the elements to be funny but the delivery is just grating.

4977544,4,B00687XNVM,"This was a cute film about being in one's early 20's and figuring life out.  Lena Dunham, now of ""Girls"" fame, not only wrote and starred in the film but cast her real-life family in it as well.  This was a good call, because the interactions between the main character (Aura, played by Lena Dunham) and her mother and sister seemed authentic that at times I felt like I wasn't watching a film at all but a reality show or old family films.

Mainly, the film is about Aura, a recent film school graduate, moving back in with her super-successful mother and overachieving younger sister, and the events that unfold.  Aura gets a job as a hostess at a local restaurant, meets some very pretentious guys, and makes some really irresponsible decisions.  But she does so in a charming, unassuming way that makes you still somehow root for her.

Her younger sister is...well...a brat - and a total momma's girl to boot. The movie explores the dynamic between these women - their lack of communication, jealousy towards each other, and hidden fears. There's a subplot involving the eldest daughter's quasi relationship with a down and out (youtube) performance artist, a co-worker (chef), and the fight for attention between her two best friends, but the movie never really gets into the heads of these characters.

4977556,3,B00687XNVM,"""Tiny Furniture"" is an independent film, starring Lena Dunham of ""Girls"" fame, before her time on Girls. It's about a young New York woman returning home from college to try and start her new life. She struggles to make friends, meet quality men, and keep the peace with her younger sister and successful artist mother. Dunham's real-life sister and mother play those roles in the film, and I have to say, for a group of amateur actors, everyone does a really great job.

The film is slow-paced but there are some genuinely funny moments, particularly scenes with Dunham's male friend who stays at the apartment for an extended period of time.

I've always been a fan of Lena Dunham. This movie works on some levels, particularly as a showcase for her dry humor, but the plot and storyline in general don't work as a whole that well.

4977559,2,B00687XNVM,"I'll admit to having watched this, and even to having chuckled a few times. But it made me feel vaguely unclean. None of the characters are very sympathetic, a few of them are repulsive.

I started it in the spirit of ""seeing what the kids are up to these days"" - I read Slate, and have noticed how enraptured the editorial staff over there is with Dunham's t.v. series Girls, how they seem to think it characterizes the up and coming generation - and shut it off in a mix of corrupt sympathy, schadenfreude and mild distaste.

I think Lena Dunham's character (both in the sense of her role in this film, as her personality in life) may be revealed in a line she has her alter ego here ""Aura"" write in her journal:

""Here's a list of things I want: a violin bow, a lover - and please make it work to make me happy, my luck in love is always so poor - to start getting my art together, to weigh 128 to 125 and be happy, a toe operation, a dulcimer, a black beret, sunglasses, a new journal, floor sanded, to learn to use a dark room, and to make little movies - ones that have me in them..""

This solipsism may come as close to prayer as Lena Dunham gets, on the evidence of this film.

Jane Austen she is not. It's still in parts somehow amusing, but in a vulgar exhibitionistic, occasionally sneering way that lightly clouds the conscience after sitting through an hour and a half of it.

I stopped watching after ""Aura/Lena"" gets awkwardly ""f*'d in a (construction) pipe"" by the druggy creep misogynist chef that she is crushing on from the job she quit as a ""day hostess"" at a Manhattan bar-restaurant after only one week.

Hmm. Really, now. Is this actually what hip urbanite 20 somethings are up to these days?  Are they generally this pathetic and contemptible?

And worse, what does it say about me that it took me so long to shut it off?  Nothing good.

The main character is so completely unsympathetic that I grew to detest her. Her sex scene with the chef actually made me feel ill in her desperation and complete lack of self-awareness. It will be interesting to see what Dunham puts out when she hits her 40's.

4977565,3,B00687XNVM,"Tiny Furniture is probably intended for any young early 20-year old woman that returns home from college and struggles to figure out exactly what to do their lives, so people of this age group tend to become friends with people they have very little in common with just to fit in and experiment (with significantly different personalities in this case), they argue with their mother and sister over meaningless things only to end up realizing that they're too old to fall victim to immaturity since they have loved ones to fall back on, they hook up with guys that are drastically different (and perhaps more sexually active) and well, returning home from college for a young woman and having to live with their family involves a period of getting reacquainted with things.

Lena Dunham is the actress that stars in this indie drama, but the truth is the comedy is either really subtle or only appears briefly before switching into a more serious tone.  So overall it's definitely more of a drama.  The several arguments Lena's character gets into with her family definitely aren't intended to be hilarious.

While the first 20 minutes are really dry and almost boring enough to consider switching it over, Tiny Furniture ends up being not that bad of a film in the long run.  Once Lena gets out and experiences friendships and relationships with women and men and learns what kind of people they are, the storyline improves.  However I never felt Lena's job as a waitress (if I remember) was given enough time.  In fact make that very little time overall.  Obviously she's unhappy working there and I felt the story should have focused more on her unhappiness of having to be there.

I feel the final 15 minutes -though nothing extraordinary and perhaps disappointing for those expecting a more fitting conclusion- are the best segments.  A little graphic with the sexual content perhaps (both the act itself and the conversation that comes afterwards- most of us aren't *that* comfortable!)

Similar to Ms. Dunham's show girls, the movie lacks racial diversity of any kind, deals with privileged people with first-world problems, and nepotism is highly apparent in the casting.

This film really is the ""anti film"" because it goes against the idea of having a plot, or having the male gaze, having filters, or beautifying anything.  I praise Ms. Dunham for always keeping it real and not holding back but in the end her work is boring.  Maybe it's because I am male and I can't relate to ""girl"" issues or the fact that my post college experience was extremely different from hers.

Aura's life unfolds without plot because there is none. The film seems deliberately motionless, although deep currents are stirring. None of these characters have what you might call chemistry, and that seems deliberate. This is a movie about people who are all passive-aggressive, including Aura. Nobody laughs or tries to say anything funny, and when Aura is happy sometimes, she doesn't trust it.

Furthermore many have proclaimed Dunham and her work to be the voice of our generation, which is sad because Dunham work is so mirrored form her over privileged life in which most can't relate to.",1362960000,3,1383,4.741666666666666
4977571,1,B00687XNVM,"These are the most annoying characters in the world. Entitled, spoiled, whiny, pretentious, self-centered.

It is truly hard to stomach the dialog and issues these characters face. It is just so, so pretentious and trivial. The whole film reminds me of those First World Problem memes where people moan about how difficult their lives are as they live rent free with their parents and work 5 hours a week at an optional job they take just to fill the time. This may have been the post college experience for Dunham, but I doubt it is the experience for most of society. Sadly, I think this film perpetuates stereotypes about college graduates, whites, the upper class, the current 20 something generation and the United States - lazy, mooching, self-centered.

Here's a brief overview of the characters:

Aura, a recent college graduate, moves back in to live with her rich mother in Tribeca and spends her time helping herself to her mother's wine and food, lounging about in a disheveled bed or walking around with no pants on. She takes a part time job as a hostess, but decides it's too ""boring"" and beneath her so she quits.  Jeb, a really irritating, condescending Youtube film sensation is a guy she is crushing on and invites to stay in her mother's home. He mooches off her and her mother, and has no interest in Aura whatsoever when it comes to romance. Keith is a depressed chef in a bad relationship who only perks up to Aura when she mentions she has a friend who can supply him pills. Charlotte is Aura's best friend who has known Aura since they were both in utero, but speaks with a British accent despite having grown up in NY. Aura's mother is a distracted, emotionally distant artist who is bonded more to the obnoxious 17 year old sister. The story is more or less about Aura's struggle to find herself in this new life after college.",1362873600,16,1854,4.62613981762918

Lena Dunham indulges herself here (as she does in her HBO show) by casting herself and her relatives/friends in an autobiographical sketch of a whiny, spoiled brat who thinks the world revolves around her.  Do we really need to see that when we encounter it all of the time in 'real life'?  What's next for Criterion...a release of ""Here Comes Honey Boo-Boo""?  This is just another low-budget, mumblecore, artsy-farsty, bit of trash that would get a 'C-' if it were turned in as a film school project.  Boring & pointless except for a cure for insomnia.

It boasts powerful script, amazing cinematography, wonderful score, and fine performances from the likes of Marlon Brando, Karl Malden, Ben Johnson, etc.  In addition, it has the distinction of being Brando's only directing credit.

4977575,3,B00687XNVM,"The picture on the cover, of Aura laying on the floor says it all;  that IS Aura, throughout the film, a dour plain-jane, with a whiney voice, moping about.  Her style ranges from unkempt to frumpy;  her attitude somewhere between depression and stressed.  It's listed as a Drama/Comedy, but I fail to see what's funny, unless we're supposed to laugh AT Aura and Co;  but the characters aren't like that.  They're dysfunctional, but not portrayed in a manner that would make them subjects of our laughter, as say those in ""Portlandia"", where characters based on similar people are exaggerated, and in the exaggeration lies the humor.

According to the blurb for this film, Aura has just graduated college and returned home confronted by several issues (confronted by, because she won't confront anything) including her boyfriend having left her for Burning Man (Colorado, actually, don't know where the BM comes in) and having a useless film degree.

Useless?  The film never explains why it's useless.  I guess the film makers presume we, the working stiffs in the audience, consider film degrees a good way to spend a lot of money to no practical end, but Aura is the daughter of a very successful artist mother;  She has come back to New York---which is displacing California as the studio production center of American film and TV; and Astoria, the hub of much of that activity is close by.  So does she put out applications there?

No.

She gets a hostess job, on the recommendation of her childhood friend, because---so very Aura---it's there, doesn't require any effort, and it's basically hers to take.  You'd expect this from a high school student, or a young person without a degree, but she's barely home and she's already settling, not reaching, not putting out any effort.

And whining, moaning, moping about.  Constantly.

In short, Aura, and most of her circle, are the sort of kids you read about, children who grew up in busy homes where the parent(s) often found it faster to do the chore themselves, than to assign it to the child and see they get it done.  We've seen the outcome, and it isn't pretty:  The sad gay guy who jumped off a bridge after his roommate maliciously posted pictures of him kissing another man;  the young talented hacker arrested on archaic Federal laws, who killed himself in prison.  What on earth would have become of the Gay Rights movement if it's leaders had killed themselves at the first of many humiliations they faced?  What would have become of the anti-Apartheid struggle, if Nelson Mandela had killed himself when first arrested?  Aura is one of these tragic children who've fallen into adulthood unprepared; a person with no sense of perspective, for whom the slightest of life's many pricks becomes a festering wound.

And oh the tantrums!  She breaks her mother's rules, and when questioned, first runs to denial, then turns the questions into accusations against her mother; and finally, like a two year old, starts screaming and throwing stuff on the floor.

I like little films where conversation is all that happens. I loved the ""Before Midnight"" movies and ""A Christmas Tale"".  But those had adults, engaging in adult conversations.  This is not one of those films.  This is a film about a woman-child who eventually decides to come back home and resume her childhood, and even finishes the film by climbing into bed with her mother to seal the deal, just like the little girl she refuses to accept has grown up.

While many college graduates would only dream of the opportunity of being rent-free in New York City, Aura cannot seem to even hold down a simple job.

4977598,3,B00687XNVM,"It's hard to review this story because it doesn't really have a plot. The main character (played by Lena) comes home after graduating college and basically does nothing. She gets a job that she quits just because she thinks it's boring, not because anything really bad happens at work. She lets a guy have sex with her in an alley, which would be cool if she was planning on becoming a hooker, but, instead she gives it away for free. She lets a guy, whom she thinks is a great movie/TV producer, stay in her home without ever asking him why he can't make rent or buy food for himself.

The most sympathetic character is her best friend from college who Lena's character had planned on becoming roommates with. When the friend arrives, Lena's character stiffs her by saying she's not moving in with her. We never see the friend after that.

The dialogue is decent and most of the characters seem to be educated, well read, cultured, generally intellectual, but they all act like losers. Or is that the point?

That story has no ending. Her mother asks her to put a clock in another room because the ticking is annoying and then the movie stops -- not because of a computer glitch. The credits follow.

Is Lena trying to tell us that life is pointless and we just wasted two hours of our lives watching this film? No sarcasm intended. Is that what she's trying to tell her audience? I don't know.

There are a number of scenes where Lena wears very little in the way of clothing. At the time of this film, she's overweight. The problem is, I don't know if she's trying to make a statement about women not having perfect bodies or if she was just to lazy to get into shape for this movie. It's really hard to tell because there seems to be an effort to make Lena look unattractive, yet, at the same time, try to convince the audience that she has sex appeal. In the end, it looks as if the makeup artists were confused. If she is supposed to be an unattractive character that becomes attractive, or something of that nature, the message gets horribly lost.

Basically, the entire thing comes down to this: If the story is going to be two hours long, make it story with a goal and obstacles that keep us engaged. If it's supposed to be boring, make it shorter, no more than 10 minutes. Otherwise we just lose interest and and want to switch off.

I did not hate the movie, but I don't know why it's considered a comedy when there's nothing funny about it.",1352332800,6,2452,4.399558498896247

I was a ""20 something"" girl 30 years ago, but I haven't forgotten what it was like because frankly I'm amazed it's been so long already.  This movie is flat, very boring, with no story line whatsoever.  and the worst acting of any movie or show that I've seen.  UGH don't waste your time on this one!  I'd give it zero stars if I could!

and, excuse me to the reviewer who said so, but ""most"" girls act this way?  NO WAY.  I never acted this way, and none of my friends ever did, either.  Sure we all have our bad days, but this story is too unrealistic for words. I don't expect reality from movies, but this one is so far removed that it ought to be a cartoon. Pathetic.

I wouldn't even say it was character driven. The characters are flat, emotionless, pathetic excuses for human beings.

While I wasn't shocked at the wee bit of fairly mild sexual content, the meaninglessness of the sex--downright masturbatory, frankly--gave me pause to think about just how far we've really come (or haven't) since the buttoned-up, ""repressed"" '50s.  I mean, here's this smart, funny, beautiful-if-earthy, ""special"" (sorry, movie reference, couldn't help myself) girl, throwing herself at these shallow, self-absorbed, skeevy men, who, at their best wouldn't deserve her.  I guess the worst part is that I know girls...most girls...act this way, and it's so undignified, unbecoming, and, yes, even pathetic, and that makes me sad.

That said, I just lovedlovedloved Lena Dunham's Aura; I found her vulnerability, relate-ability, and complete naturalness absolutely enchanting (yes, enchanting): the secret girl-crush I developed for her just made my heart hurt all the more whenever she dropped her not-so-subtle ""I'm available"" hints or walked around nearly naked in a desperate attempt at being noticed.  Well, Aura, bless your heart, I NOTICED!  Now come here, you sweet thing...I'll bake something delicious for you, and we can talk, and then I can tell you how pretty and talented you are...and I'LL mean it.

This movie is trying to explore the angst and sadness that comes from leaving college and entering the real world. A protected undergraduate world full of academic concerns and intellectual friendships transitioning to an awful job, moving back in with one's family, a realization that the real world is not ivory towers and existential debates. It's a common plight in modern times, and surely many can relate.

I have to say, though, this movie impossible to watch. The characters are ""real"" in the sense that they are deeply pathetic and depressed. The dialogue is sharp and biting and blatantly (disgustingly) poetic. Mostly the dialogue is awkward, but moreover is incredibly disrespectful and antagonist. The characters are so thoroughly misdirected and unpleasant, it's not worth describing them as ""real"". Rather, they are caricatures of angst, depression, and loneliness. I have never met ""real"" people who are as consistently making such stupid decisions and who have such little respect for other human beings. Also, ""real"" people smile sometimes.

Oh, but what about the self-absorbed, unlikeable priviliged rich kids that the film supposedly endorses? It's self-effacing. Lena Dunham has channelled all the guilt from coming from the priviliged elite in New York City into this rather cutting expose that serves to confirm what most of us already suspected: that rich people are just as flawed as everyone else. It's a comedy People, not a trial to determine if Lena Dunham is a witch (if she floats, she is, if she drowns, she's not).

I found it consistently funny throughout; leaving the general good feeling that comedy brings. It really helps to have a pre-conceived dislike for the silly idiosyncracies of the digital age, and to be able to recognize satire when you see it.

4977612,2,B00687XNVM,"When Criterion announced this title, I was intrigued.  The film generated some good buzz at Sundance (or SXSW), and Lena Dunham has a show on HBO now.  After seeing this film, Criterion should rethink their criteria after this film because this film doesn't belong in the same catalog as masterworks of Fellini, Kurosawa, Antonioni, Visconti, Ford, etc., etc..  It doesn't even come close, and it's an insult to every serious film goer on the planet.

I don't think this film is the worst thing I've ever seen, but it is not a very good film, either.  It's barely a mediocre one.  It becomes more and more boring as it progresses, and aside from a few funny lines and good widescreen framing, it's an immensely dull exercise.  Most of the acting borders on grating, and many of the characters are just dull and very uninteresting.  The characters may be aimless, but the filmmaking is also aimless as well.  It's shapeless and formless, and feels like a student film more than anything.  Some people have called it a glorified home movie, and in some ways, they're right.  Lena Dunham's cast consist of her sister and mother (her mother is a famous photographer in NYC, which may explain why Lena is getting a lot of breaks in her career after one mediocre film).

Trendy critics who are praising this film to the hilt should really reconsider their opinions next time.  It is more important to look at a film objectively and criticise it on its merits than being part of the next hip, trendy thing.  While Tiny Furniture is not as amateurish as other films of its type (Tiny Furniture in in some ways a ""mumblecore"" genre, and it's more professionally polished than most of those films are), it is by no means a great film, and should not be praised as one.  Always remember.  Just because a film is an indie film doesn't automatically make it a work of genius or even a decent film.

There are some shorts on the DVD as well, and one of them, Pressure, has to be one of the worst shorts I've ever seen.  Criterion received a lot of criticism for including this film in their collection, and they deserved it in my opinion.

Also, it was mostly shot in her mom's home.  Lena plays Aura, a recent Film Theory graduate from a Midwestern university who realizes her degree is worthless.  The real life Lena - also a film school graduate -- makes a movie that is in some ways about her - but not really.  Her unusual, plainly plump persona is not unlike Woody Allen's on-screen self-deprecating self in his earlier - funny - films.  Aura's life is a series of put-upon incidents that includes a guy who made a popular Youtube video and is ""taking meetings"" in New York City who, while Aura's mom's away, invites himself into her bedroom as a permanent guest even though he has no interest in her.  With nothing much else going on in her life, Aura takes a job as hostess for a restaurant where she becomes enamored with an insensitive, married chef.  All these threads play out in a way that seems real and uncontrived.  I was kind of mesmerized by this unexpectedly witty film about how one can make art from ennui and dejection.

It takes a lot of guts for a filmmaker to show how whiny and unmotivated, and generally unpleasant, a person can be when they leave college. Indeed,
Ms Dunham's autobiographical film presents her as confrontational at every turn, and not someone I really care about. Anyone who disagrees with her is subject to a torrent of abuse so outrageous that I wonder why someone didn't just smack her.

The only extra on the DVD I watched was an interview with the fine Paul Schrader, who was convinced that this was a work of brilliance, and many of his points were valid, but not enough to erase the cluelessness of its central character. One thing Schrader pointed out was how perfectly every shot was centered, and he couldn't be more correct. I thought the subject matter could've been more enervating. Even ""Wristcutters: A Love Story"" showed unpleasant people who were at least interesting.

4977621,4,B00687XNVM,"To me, this film feels like an honest look at the world of twentysome year old generation, you know, the ones who've grown up thinking everything was possible and then reaching out for it naturally.  Things have never been like that, except for few people/times/places, and the protagonist here is finding it out as the film progresses.  In fact, she does it so fast that you'd think people like her come into the 'real' world as 2-dimensional entities, only latter to add depth as experience carves them with no curriculum, to no end other than some old cliche about life.  For some reason, you may find yourself rooting for Aura/Lena, and this comes to also show her skill at progressively embodying a character.

Indeed, she gets in some dead-end, otherwise predictable from the perspective of the viewer, then she comes out as if nothing happened, in a series, until the final two big scenes in the film when she comes full circle, or does she?

As already noted by others, this is a hattrick of sorts, for Lena is the protagonist, scriptwriter, and director of this film.  This is no small thing, for the story flows after the first minutes, filming has even some gems, and the honesty with which she treats her character is exemplar.  I know, in the Facebook/YouTube/MySpace generation Lena's achievement may not count for much, but I think there is much more here, something that coexists alright even with all the frivolity/entitlement/honesty of the above mentioned generation, and that's the drive to know and connect.

____________________
An extra-word about the type of honesty on display here.  Often, it's just a verbose game the children of earlier generations used to do it when playing unsupervised, except that this time is about getting laid.  The slow maturing generation gets to do its unsupervised explorations only after college.  I wonder how well this film will travel outside the land of the brave, time will tell.

Also, I wonder if one can reincarnate before one's passage.  At least in artistic terms, Woody Allen has reincarnated as Lena Dunham.",1330387200,4,2076,4.931034482758621

4977623,4,B00687XNVM,"'m in a very weird place when it comes to how I feel about Lena Dunham's debut film, Tiny Furniture. On the one hand, I respect here accomplishment -- taking the standard coming of age film and subverting our expectations, de-romanticizing youth and offering an unsentimental look at a young woman's immediate post-college days at her mother's loft in Manhattan. On the other hand, I find myself disliking much of the cast, wallowing as they do in self-obsessed passive agressive narcissism. But I suspect that's the point.

Dunham's characters exist in a bubble of Tribeca privilege -- they don't have problems with money, there are no social issues to speak of, and the greatest tragedy is the death of a pet hamster. They are quite literally the ""Urban Liberal Elites"" that the Republicans rail against. But beneath the veneer of privilege you find sad, miserable people who are very dissatisfied with their lives -- as if the lack of conflict and the very low stakes in which they exist leave them unmoored from life itself.

Aura, the film's protagonist, finds herself adrift in Manhattan -- college is over, and yet she doesn't know what to do next. She spends the summer pining for two men -- one, a ""YouTube star"" who has taken residence in her mother's loft but shows no romantic interest in Aura, and the second, Keith, a chef in the hip restaurant where Aura takes a job as a hostess. Both men abuse and take advantage of Aura in different ways, but the end result of both relationships is Aura blaming herself for their selfishness.

Meanwhile, Aura deals with the dysfunctional relationships she has with her mother, a famous artist, and her genius sister, who wins a major poetry award without trying. An old friend from high school, Charlotte (who may or may not be British, but has a British accent), provides Aura with companionship and bad advice, and another friend, Frankie, a new friend from college, is seen mostly from afar via telephone calls. But the two operate as counterpoints to one another -- one, an affluent young woman who lives a life of leisure and wants for nothing, and the other, a driven middle class girl with career ambitions -- and represent the two choices Aura has. The friend she sides with isn't particularly surprising, but it does help underscore the point of Tiny Furniture.

That ultimately, life is ugly and unsentimental -- that people make bad decisions and live to regret them. And despite their desire to fix things, they keep making the wrong choices. I may not have enjoyed Tiny Furniture as much as the marketing suggested I would, but I did appreciate its honesty and integrity -- both in its unflinching portrayal of the life of a young woman and its refusal to bow to Hollywood standards for coming of age stories. In Tiny Furniture, people don't come of age, they just get older. And the ticking clock of time provides no pat closure or life lessons, only the knowledge that old age is coming, and even if you manage to get things together, you may still fail to find happiness and understanding. But you may learn to live with it.

Although the film was meant to evoke Woody Allen or the early work of Nora Ephron, I'm also reminded of similar films of unsentimental youth, including an obscure indie film featuring Lauren Ambrose called Swimming, the claustrophobic personal films of John Cassavetes, and the starkly cynical 1970's BBS films, especially Five Easy Pieces.

The film was shot on HD originally, and Criterion provides a flawless transfer. Despite the pristine, yet cold cinematography, I found the film to lack the artificiality of other films shot straight to a digital format. Mostly this is due to unvarnished bodies of the actors, who look and act like real people, zits and all.

The extras include four of Dunham's short films, her first full-length feature, Creative Nonfiction (which is only an hour), an interview with Dunham conducted by Nora Ephron, and a rousing defense of Tiny Furniture by legendary writer and filmmaker Paul Schrader, who quite surprisingly is well-versed in the mumblecore genre where Tiny Furniture ultimately has its roots, as well as the criticisms leveled against both Dunham and the film.

Sometimes you will find her characters get on your last nerve, then you're right back to loving them -- just like real time friends.  I enjoyed this film a great deal!!",1462147200,4,422,4.819444444444445
