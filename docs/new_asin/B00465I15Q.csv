8417040,5,B00465I15Q,My daughter loves this video and I find that she likes to mimic a lot of what goes on in the video!,1406246400,,99,3.5454545454545454
8417041,5,B00465I15Q,This was on Netflix and my baby loved it. Netflix took it off so I had to hunt it down because it was the only thing she would watch long enough for me to do anything. It was 25 more then I wanted to pay but I think it was worth it. I paid 45 for this!,1390003200,,252,3.43859649122807

8417043,5,B00465I15Q,"We just discovered this on netflix and love it. Our two children (29 months and 11 months) stopped everything once this show started and were totally engaged. They never get tired of watching it. What you will see is a variety of adults interacting in a very positive way/one on one with the main puppet character eebee and then with a diverse selection of children from ages infant to toddler. I loved all of the developmental play that focused on listening, seeing, physically interacting (fine and gross motor). Parents, there are a lot of great ideas in here for how to play with your children.",1372636800,2,598,4.704761904761905
8417044,5,B00465I15Q,"My 9 month old loves this DVD. The video has a nice song at the beginning, and then shows a series of music based activities with Eebee that you might also do with your child. Then they play another song, and show another series of activities. There are a lot of activities that catch his attention, mostly banging spoons on pots. He'll watch the video and replicate what they're doing with his toys and thinks this is hilarious. He also likes the songs they play every once in a while. If your child doesn't have any interest in these sorts of activities, it's probably not be the video for them. There are a few things the parents do with Eebee that go over his head, but it gave my husband and I some good ideas for playing with him. If your child enjoys making music or noises, then they'll enjoy this video on their own. I notice my son also likes it when we watch the video together, bang on pots together, and dance together to the songs. So, if you aren't interested in a video to grab his attention while you go and clean the bottles, then it's a great video for you and your child to watch together.",1307145600,3,1109,4.285714285714286
8417045,2,B00465I15Q,"I purchased this video because my son LOVES the Eebee Adventures sample video made by Parents Magazine. My 10 month old has been watching the sample Eebee video while I shower since he was 8 months old. He loves Eebee (I think because he has a fun voice is and very colorful). He lights up when we sing the theme song or when he sees Eebee on the DVD. The music in the Parents video is fun and upbeat. This video, however, is only so-so. It has cute moments and a few good songs, but they are no where are catchy or up beat as the Parents Eebee video. Had this been the first Eebee video we bought, I would not have purchased any more in the series. My son will watch this video, but does not stop in his tracks or get excited when it comes on like he does with the original video we have. Where as the Parents video keeps my son's attention for a good 30 minutes, he is easliy distracted while watching this one! I wish I had purchased one of the other videos in this series instead.",1306454400,,984,4.103626943005182
