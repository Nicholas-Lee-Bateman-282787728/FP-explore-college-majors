8300576,3,B001F1VVNI,"I bought this particular 4 in 1 movie collection strictly for The House by the Cemetery because this set cost less than the stand alone movie DVDs that were being offered at the time of my purchase. It was only a penny plus $3.99 shipping. The DVD case lists the movie at 86 minutes which is the full uncut version. Some places list the full uncut version at 87 minutes but I now have the Blue Underground edition and its supposed to be the full uncut version of the movie and on my players time indicator, its 86 mins 14 secs plus an additional couple of secs of blank screen before it stops fully. But even though this 4 in 1 collection lists the time on the case as 86 mins, its NOT. Its only 82 mins. So a little over 4 mins is cut from it. Had this edition been the 86 min version like the case states, I would have given this collection 5 stars because its an awesome value at $4 total price. But since its not the full uncut 86 min version then I'm going to have to give it only 3 stars. As far as the other 3 movies go, the only other one I watched was I Bury the Living, which was a pretty good older black and white flick. I did not watch the other 2 because I just wasn't interested in watching them. So if you're looking for the full version of House, you won't find it on this particular disc.",1414368000,3,1306,4.046332046332046
8300577,5,B001F1VVNI,I BURY THE LIVING starring Richard Boone is alone worth the cost of this dvd! Plus you get 3 additional movies on it!!! This is a pleasingly GOOD PURCHASE!!!,1411430400,,157,4.448275862068965
