This is no exaggeration;David Suchet""s acting is flawless-awesome to behold. Even the best television and movies today pale in comparison to the production values,writing,and and acting in this marvelous series. TEN STARS (five just won't do!)",1385596800,10,369,5.271186440677966
5776004,5,B00D7AM2TW,I thought the acting of David Suchet and the other actors were as outstanding as ever. My husband and I enjoyed the stories to the fullest. We have yet to be diappointed with this series.,1384387200,,187,4.371428571428571

5776006,1,B00D7AM2TW,"Wow , what a load of crap! It seems that they need to keep everyone guessing because they duplicate the videos in ""series"".

5776064,4,B00D7AM2TW,"Series 7 contained dramatizations of The Murder of Roger Ackroyd and Lord Edgeware Dies.  The first is a story for which Christie first gained world fame, largely due to the surprise ending.  The film version is true to form, well designed, costumed and filmed.  But the story just works better in print, always has.

Lord Edgeware Dies is a rather forgettable piece of tripe that is a mystery-solver's vacation piece -- that is it is an easy one to solve, even if you're not paying much attention.  Unfortunately, this film version contains an error (probably deliberate) that blows the entire story and throws the viewer off-track (notably this ""error"" was not present in the book). Also, the viewer is never allowed to overhear the conversation that gives the murderer away and thus, cheats the viewer out of the tools/clues necessary to solve the mystery.  Really, a very bad show.  The highlight?  The excellent John Castle as Lord Edgeware.  Season 7 is ""meh.""

Season 8 was much better with two good entries, Evil Under the Sun and Murder in Mesopotamia.  The first was sumptuously filmed and apart from a made-up bookend event (Hastings' restaurant) the story setting is returned to Miss Castle's health resort (Ustinov's version was set in a vacation castle in the Adriatic).  For reasons I don't understand, Linda Marshall became Lionel, but the rest of the story was largely unchanged.  A bit more coherent than the Ustinov version (which rewrote and reassigned roles) this film version contains more back story and is much richer in characterizations.  Overall, a superior version of this story.

Murder in Mesopotamia - I remember reading this story and finding myself unable to believe how Louise Liedner got herself into her predicament.  No film version of this story ever could clear that up... but that is on the author, not the filmmaker.  This film takes great liberties with the story, not the least of which is to insert Poirot into the tale far earlier (and more predominantly) than he was in the original book.  Nurse Letheran, the original narrator of the tale and the one from whose perspective the viewer ""sees"" the events, has been relegated to a bit part.  Also, Hastings appears in this story, though he did not in the original.  Sheila Reily, the doctor's daughter, becomes Sheila Maitland, the Superintendant's daughter.  Apart from these changes, MiM is largely intact and well filmed.  The key to this mystery is the murder victim herself, very well played by Barbara Barnes.  Diana Stabb as Miss Johnson is outstanding;  the rest of the cast turn in creditable performances.  Season 8 is overall, excellent.",1424995200,,2642,4.9771689497716896

Murder in Mesopotamia finds Poirot accompanying Hastings to an archeological site where an apparently paranoid woman is murdered after all.

This is one of the greatest detective stories put to paper~",1398556800,7,355,4.115942028985507
5776105,5,B00D7AM2TW,"For some twenty years, Hercule Poirots definitive interpreter has been faithfully, little step by little step, bringing the master detective to life. While he may not have achieved the status of cultural icon (and this is debatable) David Suchet has succeeded in epitomizing Poirot, becoming the Belgians brand face. This is no simple achievement when other great actors have also lent their talents to inhabiting Poirot. I speak of Albert Finney, Ian Holm and Sir Peter Ustninov in particular.

Suchet is beloved in this role and for good reason. However his performance is not, by far, the only ingredient of merit in this wonderful series. Hugh Fraser contributes just the right balance of faithful friend and slightly Nigel Bruce-ish exasperation about him. Philip Jackson brings a wonderful weight to every role he plays and finds the correct measure of lets get on with it and being truly impressed (not jealous) by Poirots gifts. And Pauline Moran has just the right twist of Miss Lemon. These four are so good there is no need for a supporting cast and yet of course that we have in abundance. What would an episode of Poirot be like without a roomful of suspects for Poirot to mesmerize at the denouement of each program?

These episodes have been on DVD before. The special delight here is that, in accordance with the shows enduring popularity, a reissue was deemed worthy of new remastering (the sound and picture quality is impeccable) as well as the added bonus of having the programs in original U.K. broadcast order. This is not to be sniffed at. The considered presentation of a series like POIROT really does gain from such details as broadcast order. It means we are seeing these programs the way they were meant to be seen.

Here are the episodes in their original order:

The Murder of Roger Aykroyd  Poirots much-needed retreat to the countryside is interrupted by the murder of a prosperous industrialist.

Lord Edgeware Dies  Following the death of a loathsome aristocrat, Poirot is stymied by his suspects ironclad alibis.

Murder in Mesopotamia  The detective travels to Iraq and finds himself embroiled in a web of rivalries, jealousy, and murder at an archaeological dig.

Evil Under the Sun  A sojourn in Devon turns into an investigation for Poirot after the body of a beautiful young woman is found on the beach.

As David Suchet continues his remarkable attack on the complete Poirot stories we can all sit back and exhult in the fact there is still more to come.",1397433600,,2495,4.872340425531915
5776106,4,B00D7AM2TW,This is old stuff but very well done.

5776108,4,B00D7AM2TW,"This is where the series takes a shift.  It shows more overtly sexual scenes or gives sexual undertones which are totally missing from the books (which makes us a little wary of moving on in the series).  The characterization is still excellent, but we also miss Hastings and Miss Lemon.  While the books work without them, the emotional level of a film presentation needs their balance.",1395014400,27,387,4.833333333333333
5776109,5,B00D7AM2TW,"Series 7 & 8 were filmed in WIDESCREEN and the previous A&E DVDs cropped the sides off to give a square picture.
A&E also censored the audio for language they felt offensive and re-edited the shows to put in commercial breaks.

But now we can rejoice!  Acorn has gone back to the original British masters, restored the widescreen image as it was produced, and the audio is uncensored.

These new transfers also refine the picture, sure there is some film grain but it is a lot sharper than the previous A&E DVDs and the colors are brighter.

Ignore any false statements suggesting that series 7 & 8 were filmed in the 4x3 square picture that the old A&E DVDs presented them.  A quick comparison of the two releases shows that these brilliant new Acorn Blu-rays lose nothing at the top or bottom, but they do gain much picture on the sides.

Anyone who thinks these Blu-rays are a disappointment doesn't understand the production budgets of British Television and should take a look at the old A&E DVDs.

For the short cases, they each last ~1hr, perfect for weekday night entertainment. It is a keeper to anyone who enjoys mysteries.",1393718400,,301,5.163265306122449
5776112,2,B00D7AM2TW,"First, my rating doesn't refer to the quality of acting, directing, and production. I've loved these Poirot movies ever since they came out on DVD. I bought all but one of Series 1-6 as soon as they came out on Blu-ray a couple of years ago, offered by Acorn. The transformation from the dingy, dull DVDs of '02 and later was amazing. Though shot on Super 16 (apparently 35mm was too costly), they were Blu-ray sharp and clean and colorful--maybe not as good as modern HD, but darned good. They were in the original 4x3 aspect ratio of our old CRT TVs.

My earlier version of this review of Series 7-8 assumed that the 4x3 ratio of the earlier DVD issues was the original ratio. Another reviewer pointed out this error, and I'm correcting it: They were shot widescreen and cropped on the side to fit 4x3. So apparently what we're seeing here is as intended. But my original questions remain: Are they better than the old DVDs? Yes, the color is better, they are a bit sharper. But are they up to quality of the restorations done on Series 1-6? Not even close. And I'm not alone. Here's what the review in BluRay.com said: ""The curse of A&E strikes Poirot again. These episodes of Poirot were released on DVD by A&E Home Video in versions that were generally considered third-rate by every collector. These Blu-ray versions from Acorn Media are a marked improvement, but they pale in comparison to the superb Blu-rays (with minor issues) released by Acorn for the first six series of Poirot.""",1393632000,5,1491,4.605263157894737
5776113,3,B00D7AM2TW,"I collect Poirot but am confused about 7&8.  I have a box set of four disks, Murder Mysteries Collection, with the very same stories.  So, buyer beware that you do not already have these Poirot mysteries",1393459200,,203,4.611111111111111
