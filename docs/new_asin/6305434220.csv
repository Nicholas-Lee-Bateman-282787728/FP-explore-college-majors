7890890,3,6305434220,"The production is of high quality and worth the purchase. The tape offers two versions of Suparinpei. One done substantially more slowly than the other one, other than the speed, there is no real difference. I did not find the performance of the kata as dynamic as Higaonna Sensei has performed them on other tapes.
Higaonna Sensei performs the kata a little differently on these tapes than he did in the Panther videos, but all things change, and he is certainly qualified to change what ever he desires.  Personally, I found the Japanese Production of Higaonna Sensei performing all of the kata (1979-Reproduction also offered by Tsunami), and the performances on the Panther Videos significantly more dynamic than on this tape. If you are a Goju Ryu practitioner, this tape is still a worthy addition to your library.",1034294400,4,820,4.942028985507246
