8588566,5,B00D2HGNWW,"Fon is an extremely kind and talented profesional modelmaker. He is also a natural instructor. I met him at IPMS Santa Rosa, where examples of his professional work were on display.  His work is gorgeous and he is just as genuinely nice in person.

What makes Fon's videos exceptional is that he explains it conceptually, breaks it down in a build order that is efficient and then shows how to make corrective adjustments for real world requirement changes.",1490659200,,457,4.846153846153846
8588567,5,B00D2HGNWW,"It is what it says it is.  All Fon's stuff is well done.  If you need to acquire immediate competence in this form of model making, I can't think of a better, faster, or cheaper way to do it.

His offhand remarks on safety with sharp blades, alone, is worth the price.",1481328000,,268,4.115384615384615
8588568,4,B00D2HGNWW,"This is primarily for a single project, which is the main downside.  I was hoping it would have more general tips and tricks.
The instructor is very knowledgeable, and the video is well-produced, but though he talks about the techniques used for this project (which can be used in other ways) it's really all about an architectural project...no set design at all, which is what I was most interested in.",1471046400,,403,4.757142857142857
