8331519,3,B001OTZNZS,"it was a bit slow, but the premise was interesting....when no one else would believe her she believed in herself.",1405987200,,113,4.7
8331520,4,B001OTZNZS,"Pound for pound, foreign films outclass American films.  While this movie was predictable and the acting was good, it had a few interesting twists.  For one, the psychiatrist was not so quick to dismiss and drug Cecilie.  Second, the short case management discussion that he had with the other attending docs (while smoking on the balcony) was equally unusual and highly likely not to be seen in similar American movies.  Third, the fact that so-called alternative treatment (hypnosis) was even seriously considered with a serious discussion of reincarnation as a possibility distinguishes this film.  I would have given this film a 5th star had it not been so darned predictable and nearly all supernatural activity having to have to occur at night or while Cecilie is alone.",1388275200,,776,5.078740157480315
8331521,3,B001OTZNZS,"It was just OK.my husband & I love Scandavian noir novels, films & TV shows, but this film left us cold.  It was overly atmospheric (implausibly so), & we could never quite figure it out, but again, I think because the premise was just too implausible for us.  The female lead was terrific, but the rest of the cast were OK, but just so.  For $2.99 on a col winter Sat. night?  Not a bad deal, fun to watch w a partner/spouse/friends, but don't expect to mich",1385769600,,459,4.241379310344827
8331522,5,B001OTZNZS,Good mystery/gothic type flick. Nicely written with no giveaways. Highly recommend this film. I could even stand to watch it again.,1379894400,,131,5.285714285714286
8331523,5,B001OTZNZS,"Very subtle and well acted, the story unfolds sensibly and escalates into a resolution with a hint of questioning about how mental illness is treated.  I don't care for categories but if you need one..... File it under supernatural thrillers.",1374192000,3,242,5.05
8331524,5,B001OTZNZS,"Thought i would take a chance on this one, considering the only review. As it turns out, this is a must see! After watching The Wedding, which is also dubbed, I have found these movies to bring the screen to life! The actors make u feel your watching the real deal, and do not disappoint! Cecilie questions her own sanity, when she starts having visions. She tries to reach out for help, but soon realizes, she's on her own. I give cast and crew 5 stars!",1359504000,5,454,4.290697674418604
8331525,5,B001OTZNZS,The service I experience with this seller was first rate. I would not hesitate to do business with this seller again. Great experience!,1232582400,,135,4.913043478260869
