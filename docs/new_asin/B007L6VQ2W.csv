5095135,5,B007L6VQ2W,"I loved the trailer especially ""introducing Will Ferrreeelll""  This won't garner a wide audience but for those who select it, and if they enjoy a risky movie, they will be delighted.  Bravo...",1342656000,3,192,4.96875
5095136,4,B007L6VQ2W,"""Ill take care of my family, let the devil take care of you."" After Armando's (Ferrell) brother Raul (Luna) returns home he is happy is family is whole again. His father is happy that his favorite son is back and they are all impressed with his new girlfriend. After talking to her Armando begins to wonder about his brother's new wealth. When he finds out his brother is a drug dealer he begins to second guess everything. When a family tragedy occurs it is up to Armando to avenge the Alvarez name. I have to preface this by saying that I am a huge Will Ferrell fan and love just about everything he has done (wasn't a fan of ""Semi-Pro""). After the masterpiece that was ""Anchorman"" he did seem to make a few movies where he played that guy over and over. I really liked it but when you saw a movie with him you knew exactly what you were gonna get. Then I saw ""Everything Must Go"". I gained more respect for him after that because of his stretch to become more of a dramatic actor. Then he does this movie...entirely in Spanish. I was looking forward to it but wasn't sure what to expect. I should have known however. The comedy is definitely Ferrell type comedy...over the top line delivery and totally off the wall things that you can't help but laugh at (such as we walks to a large brown calf to pick it up, when he turns around it is an obviously stuffed black one). Trying his best to make a cheesy 70's style Mexican movie he 100% attains his goal. Cheesy effects and bad editing make it that much funnier. Overall, if you like Will Ferrell you will love this movie. I sure did. Very funny. If you are worried that his humor won't work in another language don't worry. It does and then some. I give it a B+.",1342137600,3,1716,4.283076923076923
5095137,3,B007L6VQ2W,"This deadpan spoof of Mexican ""telenovelas"" generates a fair quotient of laughs provided you tap into its goofy spirit. Will Ferrell stars in this all-Spanish language tale of a Mexican rancher who has to defend his father's land after his no-good brother (Diego Luna) shows up having owed a debt to a drug lord (Gael Garcia Bernal). Andrew Steele apparently wrote ""Casa De Mi Padre"" in English, but the film is a faithful Mexican soaper all the way through, and one's familiarity with the genre probably will dictate how much of the film you'll find funny. Though I'm certainly not a constant viewer of Univision, there are some inspired moments here along with several amusing songs penned by score composers Andrew Feltenstein and John Nau. Lionsgate's Blu-Ray of this barely-released comedy hits stores on the 17th with commentary with Ferrell, Steele and director Matt Piedmont on-hand; deleted scenes; commercials; a featurette; music video; and interview with the late Pedro Armendariz, Jr., who co-stars in the film. The 1080p transfer is fine (English subs run on the picture itself as opposed to below it) and the DTS MA audio is nicely engineered.",1342051200,7,1158,5.0680628272251305
5095138,4,B007L6VQ2W,"Will Ferrell has distinguished himself in such memorable comedies as ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,"" ""Elf,"" and ""Wedding Crashers,"" but he's never before taken on a movie like ""Casa de mi Padre.""  Ferrell plays Armando Alvarez, a simple Mexican who is proud to work on his father's ranch.

When the ranch begins to struggle financially, Armando's younger brother, Raul (Diego Luna), comes to the rescue and brings his beautiful fiancee, Sonia (Genesis Rodriguez).  Raul is a successful international businessman who shows promise for helping save the ranch, but when Armando falls for Sonia and Raul's business dealings turn out to be shady, the Alvarez family find themselves in a war with each other and with Mexico's most feared drug lord, Onza (Gael Garcia Bernal).

The distinctive aspect of ""Casa de mi Padre"" is that it is in Spanish and broadly parodies low-budget Mexican cinema with intentionally cheap-looking studio sets juxtaposed with actual locations, fake horses on wheels,  badly ""disguised"" miniature models standing in for an actual town, and over-the-top performances. Wisely, director Matt Piedmont has kept the action brisk and the running time brief, so the movie never overstays its welcome. And, yes, there are English subtitles. The experience is richer if you are familiar with the genre being spoofed, but offers plenty of laughs even if you aren't.

Bonus extras on ""Casa de mi Padre,"" available on Blu-ray and DVD, include audio commentary with Will Ferrell, director Matt Piedmont, and writer/producer Andrew Steele; deleted scenes; making-of featurette; and a music video.",1341964800,,1613,5.355731225296442
5095139,5,B007L6VQ2W,"As a member of a Christian-based faith, this movie was much more interesting than expected; the Christian symbolism within the movie is so obvious that it's hard to miss, and yet if you miss it, you miss a lot of why this movie is so kick-butt! The absurdity of the film is awesome as well, but really, it's the symbolism that held my attention and keeps me coming back. :)",1340323200,3,373,4.3428571428571425
5095140,3,B007L6VQ2W,"In a parody of old Spanish westerns, Will Ferrell stars in an all Spanish-speaking role as a Mexican man whose family is involved with local drug dealers. He takes on the bad guys and seeks to save the life of a beautiful woman in the process. Some scenes in the film were intentionally done in a manner to appear to be amateurish to emulate a low-budget production, and these scenes are good for a few laughs. The movie was not done as a non-stop laugh parody, but is actually played straight more so than expected. I would have liked the movie to be a bit zanier and a clear attempt to parody the genre, but perhaps this would have tread into the territory of silliness. Overall, the movie was okay, and is worth seeing.",1334016000,4,722,4.395522388059701
5095141,5,B007L6VQ2W,"I love telenovelas! That being said, Will Ferrell's Spanish in ""My Father's House"" is just bad enough that I can almost understand it, and trust me: I do NOT speak Spanish, so the captions are a treat.

This delightful spoof takes itself seriously every single second of its running time, which always adds to the fun. When the badly made fake white puma laughed sardonically, I bought every moment; and I loved the horseback riding on stuffed animals with a fan blowing their hair. Any time our three heroes are riding in the pickup, the same scene goes by the ""windows"" and you can practically see the wires holding up the bushes. Rough scene shifts and laughably poor continuity were fun all the way, e.g., our hero has a roll-your-own cigarette in his mouth, dribbling tobacco down his shirt front. In the next camera angle...no cigarette. Then from another view, there is that cigarette again!

We follow the estupido second son of a successful Mexican rancher. All the dialogue is in Spanish with the exception of a creepy American DEA officer who speaks a clumsy combination. This cast is terrific:
  * Will Ferrell (""The Other Guys"") is Armando, a well-meaning but clumsy hombre who will never measure up to his padre's expectations. He is still a virgin because the ""right woman"" hasn't come along. I think his chances would improve if he could only learn how to roll his own cigarettes!
  * Genesis Rodriguez (""Man on a Ledge"") Sonia seems to be the ""right woman"" despite the fact that she is engaged to Armando's brother and appears to be connected to drug lords. In keeping with the telenovela tradition, she sings at the end!
  * Diego Luna (""Y tu mam tambin"") Raul is Papa's favorite. Little does the old man suspect that his son's obvious succe$$ is NOT based on livestock!
  * Gael Garcia Bernal (""Letters to Juliet"") is an especially great ""bad guy!"" He lights two Canadian Slim cigarettes and smokes them alternately with either hand. He wears white cowboy boots that are waaaay too long, and is obviously having a blast! Actually, a sharp-eyed Amazon reader enlightened me: Those white boots are not too big for him. He says they are called chuntaros and they are made that way. I added this information on my blog @ JayFlix.net, as well. Thanks!

There is a hilarious scene where two Mexicans are discussing the drug trade. The ""Narco"" rationalizes that he isn't selling drugs to Mexicans, just fat, stupid Americanos. I was delighted with the equal time granted to the Gringos before the film ended!

The sound track is loaded with referential, mariachi-tinged msica that adds to the fun. The men's trio ""No Se"" (""I Don't Know""), complete with bongos, was a delight. Amazon.com will let me know when I can add this one to my collection.",1333065600,35,2757,4.756813417190775
5095142,4,B007L6VQ2W,"Just how far does Will Ferrell's comedic might stretch? At this point he's proven to be such a bonafide box office success that we forget his most memorable films, such as Anchorman and Talladega Nights, weren't sure fire hits. They were ambitious and unique at the time, and Ferrell has had the market cornered on goofy, retro comedies ever since. And yet nothing is quite the gamble Case de mi Padre poses, a Spanish-language western spoof requiring the audience to *gasp* actually read what the heck is going on. What is this? The Artist for dopes?

Unfortunately, that's how far too many will react to the idea of something like this, and Ferrell deserves credit for taking a swing at a fresh idea that also turns out to be one of his best yet. Inspired by those crappy, histrionic Spanish telenovellas you might find on Telemundo, but also mixed with a touch of Tarantino grind house and Sergio Leone spaghetti western, Case de mi Padre takes laughing at badly dubbed foreign films to a whole new level.

Ferrell does his overgrown goofball thing as Armando Alvarez, a moronic rancher with an inflated love for the land that exceeds his need for a woman on his arm. He's the 40-Year Old Virgin with a pair of spurs and a 10-gallon hat, accompanied by his two slightly less idiotic buddies(Efran Ramirez and Adrian Martinez). Armando's father knows his son is a dim bulb, which is why he's so ecstatic upon the arrival of his more successful son, Raul(Diego Luna), and his scorchin' fiance, Sonia(Genesis Rodriguez). Immediately you know there's going to be trouble, and that Armando will fall flat on his face in love with Sonia. It only gets worse as Raul's wealth has been amassed through illegal drugs, and his arrival has put him at odds with La Onza(Gael Garcia Bernal), a drug dealer who seems to be stuck in the 1960s.

Actually, the whole film sorta feels that way, lost in another world where things like expensive set pieces, proper camera lighting, and sound editing don't exist. Shot in the fictional ""Mexico-Scope"" style, SNL veteran director Matt Piedmont pokes a lot of fun at the terrible soapy dialogue and over dramatization that has made the genre so funny to us now. The cast seems to recognize one crucial point that keeps the film from straying too far off the reservation, and it's the seriousness which the stars of these shows took their craft. Somehow that makes it even funnier that they aren't in on the joke. Genesis Rodriguez, who got her start in Spanish telenovellas, in particular handles the material like a champ. With the exception of Luna, who always looks like he's one step away from playing the corpse in Weekend at Bernie's, Rodriguez easily outshines everyone else.

That's not to say Ferrell isn't his usual reliable self, and his doe-eyed routine fits nicely with the wildly over-the-top violence and humor. If he ever decided to go back on tour and do an impersonation of George W. Bush vacationing in Mexico, Ferrell has the language nailed.

Dedication to the look and style of the time is what makes the film really work, with the majority of the best gags based on how cheaply constructed everything is. The horses might as well be broomsticks. The magical sounding ""Pool of Seven Tears"" is a glorified kiddie pool surrounded by paper mache shrubbery and Styrofoam trees. The scenery races past stationary riders like in those old Flintstones cartoons. Allowing yourself to be immersed in the silliness will go a long way in maximizing the enjoyment, which is why it's such an egregious error when the story breaks for a mock apology from the director(or his assistant) over the poor special effects. Why tell us that? The effect is to totally take the audience out of the moment and remind us that this is basically just a glorified SNL sketch.

Wisely, Casa de mi Padre clocks in at a brisk 84 minutes so there's little chance of wearing out a welcome. Not all of the jokes hit the mark, but more than enough do to make this a film worth spending a little time with. Undoubtedly Ferrell's strangest movie yet, those are usually his best, and his fans would do well to endure those pesky subtitles to see him at his most inspired.",1332288000,,4185,4.726027397260274
5095143,5,B007L6VQ2W,"Nice parody of Westerns and Spanish telenovelas. Of course seeing a ""gringo"" play the lead in this comedy role with a largely Mexican cast was going to be fun, but Ferrell was absolutely perfect and the only guy that could have pulled it off very well.

It's true Will's career has been up and down with hits and misses, but he made a homerun here. I really enjoyed the movie.

With his poor broken Spanish and intentional bad acting guaranteed a laugh a minute. Just looking as his black perm and acting Mexican pretty much sold the movie. However, the barrage of over the top and bizarre sequences pretty much elevated the movie even more (and there are too many too list).

Probably my favorite involved the ones involving the ""White cat"" (pure gold).

The supporting cast is made of acclaimed Mexicans actors like Diego Luna, and the late Pedro Armendriz Jr., and young up and coming actress Genesis Rodriguez who all gave great comedic performances.

You can tell they really had fun with this one.

5095144,3,B007L6VQ2W,"There are times when you can't really tell if an actor becomes less enjoyable as their career progresses or if you just grow out of them as you get older. It's as if you love certain projects this actor was a part of or particular characters this actor brought to life throughout their career, but they fizzle out as they become household names. Will Ferrell is such an actor. Ferrell was hilarious when he showed up in brief cameo roles early on in his career and eventually supporting roles in bigger projects before moving on and doing the likes of Anchorman, Talladega Nights, and Step Brothers. Ferrell is still entertaining at times, but it's like his ability to improvise has become less humorous over the years or something. Maybe he just isn't as funny anymore, he's had too much exposure, or maybe his style didn't mesh well with his latest project Case de mi Padre; a film presented entirely in Spanish.

Casa de mi Padre immediately has this Robert Rodriguez quality to it during its opening credits. With music that screams Mexican culture with its heavy use of horns, bongos, and guitar plucking, its low budget, and the animation used during its opening, Casa de mi Padre starts off not unlike Desperado or Once Upon a Time in Mexico if either one began with Will Ferrell picking up a baby cow. This sensation doesn't last long as it the absurd takes hold in mere moments.

The comedy does seem to be aimed more towards people of Mexican descent, which may be its biggest asset for that demographic but its biggest flaw for Will Ferrell fans. Everyone around me seemed to find this downright hysterical while I only snickered a handful of times throughout the movie. Specific references will probably go over your head and what looked like just another extra in the movie seemed to be somebody well-known to everyone else in the audience.

In the March 16th, 2012 issue of Entertainment Weekly, Ferrell openly admits to not being able to improvise as much as he'd like because his focus was mainly on making sure his Spanish was good. That could be why Casa de mi Padre feels so lukewarm overall. It does have its fair share of funny moments though. The moments shared between Armando (Ferrell) and his friends Esteban (Napoleon Dynamite's Efren Ramirez) and Manuel (Kick-Ass's Adrian Martinez) are some of the most ridiculous. Their prolonged laughter that seems like the bit was lifted straight out of a ""Family Guy"" episode, the repeated use of the same green screen background, and what will eventually become that infamous toy truck sequence will have you laughing just how openly terrible it really is.

That welcomed use of cheesy effects and cheap props are the prime source for comedy though. Armando and Sonia's (Man on a Ledge's Genesis Rodriguez) first encounter at the spot where Armando's mother died, their inability to ride horses, Onza (Gael Garca Bernal) smoking two cigarettes at once, and the movie crew appearing in the reflection of someone's sunglasses are a few examples. The most talked about scenes will be the sex by campfire scene and the tiger/coyote sequence which follows immediately afterward. Both scenes are just too preposterous not to remember. Throw in a few purposefully fake animals and an animatronic tiger by Jim Henson Studios and you've got something that really embraces its sleaziness on your hands. You can't help but laugh.

Casa de mi Padre is no Anchorman and it doesn't come close to being Will Ferrell's best work, but the way everything feels so retro and how it seems to turn terrible takes and awful mistakes into memorable comedy is kind of incredible. Cheap, low budget, cheesy, lousy, garbage, or whatever you want to call it, Casa de mi Padre is unbelievably ludicrous and is fairly amusing for a movie that is so monstrously ridiculous.",1332028800,5,3810,4.837423312883436

5095184,5,B007L6VQ2W,"A coworker recommended seeing this film, now I'm recommending it to everyone who's a Will Ferrell fan.  This movie is a mixture of at least 5 other movies themes all in one. First and foremost if you're not into foreign language films with subtitles, you may not enjoy this movie.  Spoken completely in Spanish, even by Will, and not dubbed, this movie is basically centered around the life of a Mexican ranchero and his family. To set the tone, throughout the entire movie Will seems to be imitating George W Bush, but with the humility and hidden ferocity of Jet Li.  Supported by his vaquero (cowboy) friends, life on the ranch for Armando (Will Ferrell) seems routine and peaceful.  Unknowingly to him, Armando gets pulled into the sinister world of Mexican American narcotics trafficking by his brother and his beautiful fianc.  Trapped between the love he has for his family, his family's name, honor, and dignity, the burning desire he now has for the brother's fianc, and the evil narcotics world that he's been dragged into, Armando must quickly come of age and find a way to defend his life, his family, and his family's dignity that he holds so dear. This movie is full of slapstick comedy, oddities than can only appear in a WF movie, with action, drama, and romance akin to a Mexican novella.

It wasn't funny to me and not even silly, except for the silly maneuvers during a sex act and a silly giving of a crushed cigarette to a dying man and the dying man taking a drink from time to time during a gunfight before he was killed. I also did not think it was funny to have all of the dialogue in Spanish.

Wow the DEA agent's ""spanish"" was a disaster compared to Ferrell's...If Ferrell learned Spanish just for this role, I am truly impressed (although he surely had the best Spanish tutor available). the main problem I saw was with his prolonged speaking patterns/the emphasis placed on certain phrases, etc which is difficult to master in any language.

  I loved this movie for it's uniqueness.  I am a native American speaker with Spanish as a second language, so it's always interesting to see movies in Spanish or mixed both languages.  This movie is great for those closer to the beginning levels of Spanish (slow speech makes it easy to understand). I definitely could have done without the several shots of Ferrell's butt, but other than that it was enjoyable. The ending could have been stronger.

Sonia is Rals fiance, but she and Armando are romantically attracted to each other, In the meanwhile, the lvarez brothers have to face a cruel local drug lord Onza (Gael Garca Bernal).

You don't have to take the melodramatic story seriously, as this is done as sendup of telenovela. I haven't seen any of the original telenovela, but I can see the point of Casa de Mi Padre when deadpan Will Ferrell keeps speaking in Spanish throughout the film. It was funny, sort of, for about ten minutes or more.

But thats all. Casa de Mi Padre is a pretty short film that runs only 84 minutes, but it still feels very long. The idea of Will Ferrell doing a genre parody is not bad, but making a feature film needs something more than that, like a good story and interesting characters. The character of Armando lvarez is uninteresting, if not Will Ferrell himself.

I hope I haven't missed the humor that must be very subtle. Or maybe it is just that the humor is thin from the very beginning.",1390348800,2,1220,4.51131221719457

This film is allegedly a parody of Mexican telenovellas which, from my understanding, are self parodies anyway.  I love the cheesy backdrops and fake looking animals notably the mountain lion.

This movie, and those in the same vein, is a litmus test for the type of person (especially female type person) I want to hang with.  Andrew Steele even managed to get a message in there. (Americans are not all evil, Mexicans are not all drug dealers... imagine that).

Budget constraints are a great way to expose comedic posers.  For 6m this production delivers a priceless experience, and throws in some vast tracks of ""production value.""

Harold Bloom in his ""Best Poems of the English Language,"" discusses the necessity for authentic poetry to reflect the ""art of strangeness.""  (Now you know why I will never get laid).  I feel authentic humour, at its most basic, depends on the art of strangeness to make things funny.

5095501,1,B007L6VQ2W,"Some people like Will Ferrel's movies; others hate them, but the one positive thing about his career is that he has generally picked original movies; no sequels, spin-offs, parodies or reboots.  Films like Wedding Crashers, Stepbrothers, Blades of Glory and Talledega Nights were all unique films that however disgusting or disturbing to watch, were clearly original screenplays.  Until now.  Starting with Land of the Lost, this movie, and an upcoming sequel to Ron Burgundy, it seems Ferrel has gone the way of the rest of Hollywood; sticking with the tried and true.  This film is a parody of Mexican western films that one can sometimes catch late at night on Univision.  Ferrel plays the good, homely son of a wealthy Mexican rancher who must protect his family's land and honor from the intrusion of a drug cartel.  Complicating matters is his brother, who has joined the drug business, and his brother's fiance, played by latina beauty Genesis Rodriguez.  Filmed entirely in Spanish, this movie is ridiculous at every level.  Ferrel is clearly reading from a script the entire movie as one can hear every syllable in his Spanish dialogue.  The gunfight scenes are a cheap mixup of Rambo, Clint Eastwood and the Matrix films, with Ferrel's character dodging bullets from multiple shooters while his hair stays in perfect form.  Everything from the set design to the special effects seems accentuated to look as fake as possible.  All in all, a big waste of time watching this movie.",1358208000,,1488,4.983805668016195

Those who like Will Farrell will love this movie. And for the rest of us, it could be a fun night if you've had enough to drink to make it better than it is.",1358121600,,471,4.425287356321839
5095503,4,B007L6VQ2W,"Movies such as ""Napolean Dynamite"" or ""Moonrise Kingdom"" are released with little or nothing to do with everything else happening in the industry, but their originality makes them a welcome release from the 'same old same old.' Casa de Mi Padre is of that ilk.

Here's the scoop. Will Ferrell plays Armando, son of a wealthy rancher in Mexico. He's not the sharpest knife in the drawer but he has a good heart. His brother returns to the ranch with his gorgeous, to be, wife. Brother is in ""business"" which translates into drugs. Armando becomes smitten with the young lady, but the situation is heating up with the drug biz as a rival gang starts to move in on brother's territory. Throw in a slimy DEA agent and a corrupt Mexican official and things get really messy.

This is a really off the wall flick. Will Ferrell in a Mexican movie with English sub-titles is weird all by itself, but the way they play the story is equally weird. The script is rather textbook in nature but the subtle humor, goofy, tongue in cheek dialogue and gloriously fake sets put an oddball spin on the proceedings. The first ""love"" scene between Ferrell ans Genesis Rodriguez borders on hysterical. They also pair Ferrell up with a couple of sidekicks that add a lot flavor to everything. In a couple of scenes they break into song. These songs display a sense of deadpan humor that adds to the overall cock-eyed appeal of the film.

This might not be quite worth the four stars I gave it but I'd rather err in its favor because it is well worth seeing, and viewer support of this kind of film lets other producers/directors know there are other avenues available besides body counts and car chases.",1357862400,,1681,4.596666666666667

The gringo DEA agent who tries to  talk to him in Spanish is much more representative of a gringo talking Spanish than Will was.  His accent is right on.  The overacting, the dramatic looks and music, the romantic mush to be found in the telenovelas is all parodied in a masterful manner.

5095586,4,B007L6VQ2W,"Another film I decided to watch on Netflix Streaming today (available as of 11/17/12). Casa De Mi Padre follows Armando (Will Ferrell) as he attempts to protect his father's ranch and his family from a drug lord. I think the general audience can find this film funny, but it's a little funnier if you're familiar with Mexican culture, but it's not necessary.

First, the entire film is in Spanish with English subtitles. There are plenty of funny scenes in this film, with a couple of misses. One of my favorite scenes was the scene in the bar where they have an awkward conversation and our antagonist smokes two Canadian Slims at the same time; in fact, it's hilarious how the film purposely packs awkward conversations/dialogue and exaggerated smoking. Another hilarious scene was Armando's flashback to his mother's death. There is also an incredibly awkward and funny sex scene. The audience also gets some funny music. The ending was great, and packs a significant message in a very funny way. The film is purposely overdramatic and really shouldn't be taken completely serious, though.

Casa De Mi Padre successfully spoofs Mexican culture, including the music and telenovelas. It's funny and entertaining. I recommend purchasing for fans of comedy and Will Ferrell, or renting otherwise.

Casa De Mi Padre has strong blood and violence, and nudity and a sex scene.",1353110400,,1372,5.035242290748899

I have to give him credit because in this film he was right on the money. He mimicked the overly dramatic style of many novellos without making it seem like he was mocking them and without dumbing it down. This made the film seem more light-hearted and fun considering it really had dark subject matter in it. I simply enjoyed this film and the especially the language choice which I feel went a long way in making the whole thing work.

Movie goers from other countries have to watch all the movies Hollywood churns out in English with subtitles in their language, so not liking the movie because of that is lame.

 The costume design was really good, the sets where major acting took place was convincing enough to easily follow story line and the transition to the cheap town scene and driving scenes had me laughing, and the intentionally bad film editing was just great if finding bloopers is you thing.  All the actors in the film were good.  The crappy acting was on purpose, well timed, and well spaced.

The highlights of the film are Armando trying to roll a cigarette, sex scene, and the rambling dialogue about the irresponsible behavior of Americans in the bar. It is not a ""b"" movie although it a parody on Novellas.

This film is funny because it pokes fun at that at that and at itself- and has the cajones to be different from the typical Hollywood laugh factory dreck. I buy few dvd's because I am not a big enough fan of most movies to watch them again and again.

5095833,5,B007L6VQ2W,"Will Ferrell must have some serious, serious juice in Hollywood, to put together a movie like this, so quirky and non-mainstream, and actually have it released in theaters (albeit limited). Some people have lambasted this movie for its poor production quality, which is unfortunate, because it is INTENTIONALLY poor! Please understand- this movie is a spoof! Who can rightfully criticize Ferrell for putting together this delightful, off-the-wall, Spanish language revenge movie? The man is doing what he loves, taking chances, having fun, and making people laugh. He knew this movie would not be universally embraced, but he jumped into it with the utmost enthusiasm.

So will you like this movie? That depends. If you enjoy Will Ferrell, particularly his craziest movies, like ""Anchorman"" and ""You're Welcome, America"", then YES, you will love this movie. If you can't stomach the idea of spoofs or reading subtitles (part of the joy is watching Ferrell's hilarious Spanish), then NO, you probably won't like it.

The things that made me laugh in this movie kept coming at rapid fire, despite the relatively slow pace of the movie. Whether it's the awkward silences that characters share, people belting out ridiculous dialogue like, ""I'm riding a horse!"", badly painted set piece backgrounds, or stuffed mountain lions that are meant to inspire fear, ""Casa de Mi Padre"" is hilarious throughout. Probably my favorite part of this movie is Will Ferrell's frequent, bumbling attempts to hand-roll his own cigarettes. I mean, this guy is REALLY bad at it. The fact that he can make something so mundane become so funny speaks volumes about his talent for comedy. His final cigarette, offered to a dying ally, is perhaps one of the funniest things I've ever seen! And just wait until Ferrell and his amigos begin singing under the stars, and smashing copious amounts of glass bottles against rocks (despite the fact that most of them are still half full). Also noteworthy is the absurd intro credits scene, which was clearly inspired by James Bond, and features floating scorpions and cougar heads. No, that is not a misprint.

Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that this movie would take the rather violent turn that it makes as it nears the climax, and it is done with perfect straight-faced, bad acting, despite the hilarity. This movie is one for the ages, especially for Will Ferrell fans. If you're a fan of his work, do NOT miss this gem that flew under the radar!",1346457600,,2476,4.975845410628019

This movie is a spoof of Mexican films. It involves drug dealers, ranchers, and a girl. The plot is immaterial. The fun aspect of the film is the fake sets, fake animals, fake special effects, bad editing and bad acting. This is all done by design. It would have been more realistic if we saw a boom mic lowered into the shot every now and then with a director yelling.

Because I didn't have to listen to Will Farrell in English, for some reason his lines were funnier and I was able to tolerate him. Make no mistake, this is a film for bad movie lovers.

Twisted and funny beyond belief, with a sex scene that my wife couldn't watch all the way through (mainly due to the shear hilarity of it, but also because of Will's hairy back side :)  This was pure, inspired, unadulterated silliness, nearly on a par with The Three Stooges.  Thank you Will, you've reinstated my belief that you, sir, are a very funny man (and of course so was the entire rest of the cast.)",1344038400,,557,4.378640776699029
5095888,4,B007L6VQ2W,"Not a hater, but also not a Will Ferrell fanatic. I've liked him in stuff and not liked him in stuff. But I do think the concept behind CASA DE MI PADRE is sort of genius. Take a popular American comedic actor - who happens to be the gringoest gringo around - and plant him in a Mexican melodrama and have him speak entirely in Spanish. In Ferrell's own words: ""It's telenovela meets bad Mexican western."" Just the novelty of seeing Ferrell take on this out-of-left-field role - and then full-on committing to it - was worth the price of admission. To quote Kris Kristofferson's brief opening voice-over: ""If it sounds Spanish, man, that's what it is. It's a Spanish movie."" For trivia-heads, this is a nod to Kristofferson's spoken opening of his version of the song ""Me and Bobby McGee."" And, yes, those are Christina Aguilera's lips as she belts out the title song in the opening credits.

Ferrell plays Armando Alvarez, a humble Mexican who takes pride in toiling on his father's land. But the ranch has fallen on hard times, thanks in large part to the rampant neighborhood drug trafficking. The Alvarez household is pinning their hopes on Raul (Diego Luna), the other and smarter Alvarez son who now returns after years away making a success of himself. Raul brings with him his sultry fiancee Sonia (Genesis Rodriguez), and never mind that Sonia has messed-up ties to the local drug kingpin, the elegant La Onza (Gael Garca Bernal). And, it turns out, the bold and clever Raul isn't the panacea to the ills of the Alvarez clan. Far from it. So, now, can Armando step out of his brother's shadow and resolve the community's drug problem? He'll have to do it with an unending hail of bullets and in gratuitous slo-mo. Bring on the gun battles, but, please, not until the final 20 minutes.

With English sub-titles and shot in epic ""Mexicoscope,"" CASE DE MI PADRE hilariously spoofs those trashy yet somehow addictive telenovelas. The filmmakers purposely riddle the film with deliberately obvious and cheap sets, with dubious blocking and editing gaffes and rear screen snafus. There are sight gags involving dummies briefly replacing the actors in action sequences. The film is scratched up in places and occasionally skips. There are bizarre hallucinatory interludes and musical numbers with the accompanying zestful gritos (really enjoyed the song ""Yo No Se""). It all kept me giggling.

Will Ferrell's accent sounds convincing to me. I actually assumed his voice had been dubbed in by someone else. But, no, that's Will himself servicing the dialogue, relying on his four years of high school Spanish and a dialect coach and undoubtedly on his fellow cast members who are native Spanish speakers. It's weird, by the way, to see Gael Garca Bernal in a comedy and being funny. He's certainly funnier here than he was in AMORES PERROS. And that's exactly how I'm aiming to push this film to my friends: ""Hey, check out CASA DE MI PADRe... it's funnier than AMORES PERROS."" Plus, this one has a fake mystical white mountain lion. Just in case that's the decider for you.

5095889,3,B007L6VQ2W,"I think you have to give credit to director Matt Piedmont, writer Andrew Steele and the 12 producers, including Will Ferrell, for making the movie that they expected to make.  It is unlikely anyone expected this film to land on a top 10 list.  And since it was released in the spring, that pretty much rules out Oscar.  Seriously, the movie isn't serious.  Filmed in Spanish, the movie is a parody of Mexican Westerns and Latin telenovelas, neither of which I'm very familiar.  I've seen enough of the later however to understand the clumsy staging and long, long looks at facial expressions.  Pretty much like American ""soaps.""

Here Will Ferrell plays Armando, the ""dumb"" son of a wealthy rancher (Pedro Armendariz, Jr.).  His ""smarter"" brother and the favorite son (Diego Luna) is involved in the drug trade and is intent of removing his rival (Gael Garcia Bernal) from the region.  Complicating matters is that Onza's (Bernal) niece Sonia (a smoking hot Genesis Rodriguez) is now betrothed to Raul (Luna).  Ferrell, as he usually does, plays his honest but awkward character with seriousness and sincerity.  This makes the movie sometimes outrageous but generally pretty darn funny.  He also manages his entire dialog in Spanish.

The film gets off track occasionally.  There is a long insertion in the middle of the movie where the faux filmmaker apologizes for some lost footage that he replaces with figurines.  It seemed unnecessary.  But then little cheap tricks like toy cars being moved on a small scale set were hilarious.  Perhaps the biggest scene stealer was the robotic, white mountain lion who also talks to Armando and gives him guidance.  I certainly laughed out loud more than once and smiled throughout the film.

The Blu ray package delivers the film in the usual 1080p with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  There's nothing spectacular in the video, but the movie is meant to be shown with a golden amber hue much of the time.  It does clearly show some of the set flubs, which again are part of the overall theme.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is extremely well done.  Clear dialog throughout.  With several gunfights during the film, the surround channels come into play.  Excellent audio track.",1344038400,2,2222,4.892761394101877
5095890,2,B007L6VQ2W,"A way for people to get my opinion on the movie is on a this scale
  The best movies I'll recommend to my old friends, family, bosses(make'm think you're smart). Solidly average movies I'll recommend to work aquaintances, extended family, facebook friends. A bad movie but I don't care about the time lost watching it, I just forget.  Anything worse, I write a review.

To me, the ads for this film made it seem enticing, I was expecting a Nacho Libre sort of fun.  Instead I got a film I'll probably never see again.  Let me say, I'm one of the group still a fan of Will Ferrell. That dumb juvenile comedy is great and would rather see Will Ferrell act than Adam Sandler.  HONESTLY, I don't think I've liked a Sandler comedy since Waterboy (and then I was 10).
First of all, I didn't need how they made it an offense to westerns.  I loved westerns and wish there are more today.  I hoped they would use some cliche but c'mon. Spoiler Alert: Why film on such a purposely bad stage? Cheap joke? That's a joke I out-grew after I graduated high school...I just kept shaking my head the whole time.  If Id spent $12 at the movies to watch that- I would've been furious.
Second, the spanish story.. the writing is like you took four teenagers and taught them spanish over summer, and asked them to write a story.  You find out when they're finished that they really loved the new spanish curse words they learned.
Big spoiler:  Finally the story.  A good parody needs a real honest theme in its backbone. To use a saying, its got to have heart.  I'm half-latino and yes, I even find spanish culture ridiculous at times. Loyalty to family, machaismo, religion, etc.  If they were going to make two brothers fight over honor, let's at least try to make both character's motivation crisply clear. Something real and down to earth, don't half-ass it.  This is the biggest problem of the movie.",1343865600,3,1884,4.497058823529412
5095961,4,B007L6VQ2W,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

It's clear from the start of the film that this isn't a movie to be taken seriously. After the credits, we come in on Will Ferrell getting off a horse to pick up a (brown) full grown cow. Once he picks it up it randomly turns into a (black) baby calf. Shortly after that, Armando (Ferrell) is seen with his friends Esteban and Manuel crouching below a stack of hay, grass, or some mixture of the two as they witness a murder. And behind them is an obvious cardboard backdrop, and for majority of the film scene's like this are what hold the film together.

Going in I didn't know that it was going to be practically all Spanish, but it honestly didn't bother me. Yes, the story wasn't great and the writing wasn't much better, but it's not meant to be. As I commented in another review this is in no way, shape, or form a serious film. There is a dinner scene where there's clearly a manikin in a chair, and one standing behind Ferrell dressed as a butler. Then there's a love scene with Sonia (Gnesis Rodrguez) where halfway through her body is replaced by a manikin as well. So it's clearly done on purpose, and once you accept that it becomes somewhat enjoyable. Speaking of, if that was actually Gnesis Rodrguez during the love scene then that scene alone makes the film worth watching. I first saw her in ""Man On A Ledge"" and she had a scene where she was just in her undergarments, and she was gorgeous. Here, if it's her, you get a couple of ass shots and a slight glimpse of her breast. However, you also get the same shot of Ferrell's behind which I couldn't help but laugh at.

Overall Score: 7/10 - Is this the best film I've seen? No. Is it the best movie I've seen from Ferrell? No. But at the end of the day you have to give it to him for trying something different. He's never been one to be scared of trying a role, which in the end makes him a comedian with one of the most versatile collection of films out there. So of course you're not going to fall in love with every movie he's in, that would be impossible. In the end it's just a quirky film with some decent action.

Edit: Found out that it was not Gnesis Rodrguez, but a ""butt double."" Either way the scene is pretty hilarious because of Ferrell's actions.",1343692800,3,2282,4.3

It is not meant to be 100% funny. Will Ferrell wants you to wake up. People in the United States often refer to themselves as ""American,"" but we are all Americans amigos.

from the comments made by people who did not like this movie, let me just say this:
1.  if you DO NOT speak spanish, do not try to watch this movie.  the movie is IN SPANISH ONLY and has english subtitles.  it's a movie that you must pay attention, visually, to; therefore, if you need to watch the subs, you will miss alot of the stuff that made this movie funny.
2.  if you DO NOT speak spanish, it's a pretty fair bet you've never watched a south of the border telenovela, and you probably have not watched any south of the border movies, either.  if this is the case, you will not *get* this movie.  IT'S A SPOOF.  if you don't know what it's spoofing, it will just go right over your head, which is what it seems to have done with the reviewers who disliked it, judging from the comments they made.
3.  i'm not a big will ferrell fan and i don't blindly buy whatever movie he's on the cover of.  i LOVE johnny depp and i won't buy a movie just 'cuz he's in it, either.  i do research on movies i wish to see.  now, i do not watch alot of tv.  3-4 hours a day.  i watch only one telenovela online.  so, let's say, less than 5 hours a day do i spend.  i NEVER watch live tv and i skip ALL commercials unless something fleetingly catches my eye.  but even someone that spends hardly any time a'tall glued to the set saw commercials for this movie and on english-language channels.  how those of you who missed those commercials managed to do that is beyond me.  i do watch spanish-language tv, but i saw the commercials only on english-language channels.

why will ferrell chose to make a movie with such a limited audience i...i...i just don't know!!!

now for a little rant:
HELLO! to all of you who said you did not know this movie was in spanish:  the title should've been a dead giveaway, or at least should've made you look a little closer at the box where it is clearly stated SPANISH 5:1 dolby digital audio w/english & spanish subtitles.  it's nobody's fault but your own that you learned too late that you'd be watching subtitles.  if you wrote a bad review because of that, then you should delete your review...or...go back and watch the movie and suffer through those awful subtitles and maybe you'd see something funny and change your minds.  maybe not, but if you stopped watching 'cuz you don't like subtitles, then giving a bad review is meaningless and wrong.  you are not reviewing the movie when you do that, you're bitching about subtitles and not being able to understand spanish.  it's not fair to the movie.  think about it.

ok.  rant over.

the commercials for this movie made will ferrell look like all his dialogue was dubbed.  it wasn't.  his pronunciation was forced, but it could've been alot worse.

now, i've been watching univison (looneyvision), televisa (telerisible) and telemundo (teleinmundo) 'novelas for about 10 years, with some colombian and brasilian 'novelas thrown in, a couple argentinian ones...and some of this did not make sense to me.  the biggest problem i had was the fake scenery.  one of the things i love about the 'novelas is the beautiful scenery!  having said that, i'm not really familiar with mexican movies, so there's my problem.

but alot of this nailed the 'novelas dead on the head.  the maids dressed like hookers, complete with the shoes no self-respecting maid would wear when walking and dusting the furniture all day, was just one of the perfect things.

i became obsessed with watching for the bad continuity.

another funny thing about the white puma and its connection with la onza, as Chapulina R sez in a comment to reviewer GreatMovieCriticForever, is that genesis rodriguez's father, known as ""el puma"", sang the spanish version of ""whiter shades of pale"" (another pun probably unnoticed by those who gave less than 3-star reviews) at her wedding!!!  that was what made this movie fun!

i also loved how james bond the opening theme was, and how austin powers the ending theme was, right down to the freeze frame of will and genesis jumping up in the air.  a little nod to will's fellow SNL alumnus.

i watched this with my mouth hanging open most of the time, it was so bizarre, but it made me laugh, too.  it was fun to see ferrell speaking spanish.

i loved armendariz's description of ""you have eyes like your mother's.  the eyes of a small chicken.""  until he said that, i hadn't noticed, but he's right!!!  LOL!

anyway, if you speak spanish, even a little bit, and you're in for some really odd, whacked comedy, AND you're familiar with the 'novelas, you could spend your time in worse ways.  just brace yourself for the butt scene.  (:",1343174400,,4663,4.567632850241546

This was a fantastic movie. Since I don't speak Spanish, I wasn't sure how much was accurate or not, but from the comments I've read seems Will nailed it pretty well. It's also more than a comedy; it's genuinely funny without trying too hard, but it's also visually appealing and reminds me of something I'd have expected from Tarantino.

Understanding how telenovelas are put together is a huge help with this one, the whole parody aspect and so forth.  I was impressed with his use of Spanish throughout.  The plot was dopey as you would expect reminiscent of other WF offerings and movies like Jack Black's Nacho Libre.  Even though the overall theme was pretty dark, it still managed to be funny with the intentionally bad props/scenes and the classic overacting.  Farrel's part was well done as the lowly ranchero, looked down upon by his family, who later becomes the hero and gets the girl.  And speaking of the girl....holy moly is Genesis Rodriguez hot!  She exudes a scintillating sexuality.  So much so that it was worth enduring the sight of WF's backside to spend a few seconds of bliss to see Ms. Rodgriguez in all her glory.  Some might consider the execution of that scene needless, but it certainly gets your attention!  In the end...(pun intended), if you're into Will Farrel movies you'll probably like this one.",1517961600,,1150,4.620689655172414
8519304,5,B007L6VQ2W,"After reading the imdb critic reviews, I find that many of them struggled to understand that this was a parody on Mexican novelas. I for one loved the dynamic that Diego Luna, Gael Garcia and Will had with each other. It was completely entertaining. I recommend this to any one who had watched a Spanish novela and does not mind reading the subtitles. I especially recommend this to all my bilingual paisas!",1516147200,,407,4.666666666666667

8519307,5,B007L6VQ2W,"Despite this being entirely in Spanish and entirely straight-man Will Ferrell, it was a riot.

Spanish novela, si!

007 opener, si!

Contrived, ridiculous plot, SI SI!!

Puppets, yes.

Who knew.

This is a non-funnyman WF. He is hilarious, but he is just a man. With a horse. And a family. You like WF. Watch it. Don't imagine I will watch again any time soon, but totally enjoyed. Certainly worth a rental.

Watch for the b-u-t-t scene. You may learn something about love-making.",1504396800,,480,4.780487804878049
