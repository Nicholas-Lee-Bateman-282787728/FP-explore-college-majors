8323569,5,B000HV88TW,Great video. I feel so badly for Syd. I know his friends OD'ed him on LSD which ruined his career although Syd whom liked to be called Roger really didn't want to be in the limelight. I was Roger's neighbor for many years. He was not a recluse as people state. He only wanted to have a quiet peaceful life. Many call him a recluse because he didn't do as people wanted him to do. He was intelligent and funny. I miss him greatly.,1432166400,23,429,4.119047619047619
