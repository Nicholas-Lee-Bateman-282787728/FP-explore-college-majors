8413732,5,B0002VKYIK,This is one series that keeps surprising me. I bought the first disk out of curiosity and was amazed at just how good it was. Now I'm totally adicted. ADV did an excellent job with the picture quality and the voice acting is pretty good too. We're into Vol. 6 nearing the thirty episode mark with this one and things are starting to get intresting with the revelation of the fourth Love angel *cough* Scarlet O'hara *Cough* By the end of this disk I think we also find out who Limone is *Cough* Captin Y *Cough* and our favorite pink haired heroine has a rival. I can't wait to see what happens next.,1097193600,,600,4.31858407079646
