6926426,5,B00RCYDMB6,"If only there were more of these delightful, gentle and heart warming series around today. Last Tango meets everyone's expectations of old love rediscovered, new love found and all the ups and downs of bringing up children, your own and your children's. Our 2 protagonists in their old age, marry and meld their 2 volatile families, each with their own traumas and joys. Having been sweethearts at school they meet again after years have gone by and they are now grandparents each with families who have their own sorrows and ups and downs. Allan (Derek Jacobi) has a daughter, Gillian, who is a widow raising her son on a non productive farm. Celia (Anne Reid) lives with her divorced daughter, Caroline, who is bringing up 2 sons and has her ex still living with them. How the 2 families begin and continue their lives together is sheer magic. You find yourself becoming more and more attached to these all too human people over the course of the 3 seasons, laughing and crying with them and having the same feeling of ""what? is it finished?""  at the end of each episode. I don't want to give too much away as it will ruin the story lines for you but this is a series so well worth watching and may I say, even purchasing as you will find yourself watching it again and again. I sincerely hope there will be a season 4. And 5, 6, 7 ...!!!",1444435200,,1340,4.4471544715447155

6926429,5,B00RCYDMB6,"It seems like I've watched each season about a dozen times over the past few years.
Last Tango is a story about 3 generations of 2 families falling in and out of love.
With some room for whimsy.
I find it warm, charming, delightful and new with each viewing.
The production team does an amazing and unique job of story telling.
The actors are brilliant.
It is so much better than what is passing for comedy on network tv.
I love the music. I wish they'd put out a Last Tango album.",1438732800,,481,4.239130434782608

6926431,5,B00RCYDMB6,Wonderful show with a wonderful cast. It is one of the best television shows I have seen in a long time. Thank you to PBS for showing this show in the United States. I am glad there will be a fourth season.,1428019200,4,206,3.9285714285714284

8694897,1,B00RCYDMB6,I watched part of this series on Netflix. Had high hopes that this would be a good series. The 2 lead actors are very talented. Sounded like a fun storyline of old love rekindled. Then the characters children were introduced. They embody everything that is wrong with society today. Selfishly putting their wants and needs above what their children want and need. All three of the adolescence boys were crying at one point or another over the selfishness of their parents. I see from the box of other seasons that 2 more children are introduced. I am not sticking around to see how these children are messed up. This is not the kind of show I am interested in watching.,1506902400,,669,4.583333333333333
8694898,3,B00RCYDMB6,"Great season 1 and boring and weak season 2&3. I won't buy season 4 apparently.
Its frustrating because the storyline itself was very promising and cast was great.",1504051200,,163,4.857142857142857

8694900,5,B00RCYDMB6,"The show is brilliantly acted and written. Sarah Lancashire as Caroline won a BAFTA award for her performance and the show has also won. I cannot wait to order the 4h season when it comes out and the Xmas special. Love this show,it is funny,warm,touching. Great stories within stories unfold as we get to know the families....",1494720000,,326,4.7368421052631575
8694901,1,B00RCYDMB6,the video was sold by amazon even though it cannot be viewed in my area of the country.  A waste of money - Amazon's fault.,1457395200,2,123,3.92
8694902,5,B00RCYDMB6,"Now as a Geordie can tell you, them Yorkshire folk can be a bit strange. Funny but. This was bought for Mrs Belgo Geordie to help her switch off her high powered job-no, not putting up with me, that's a bonus! Anyhow, this was in the first ten minutes a case of may not work. Followed by, it does work. Now, non stop comedy it is not. Two dysfunctional families crossing the divide and conjoining in physics means serious stress on relativity and on that scale, it delivers. Sitting through three series was no hardship-although there were times the plot came close to disintegrating into flatulence. But there were belly laughs and tears. It is the very capable Sarah Lancashire (shouldn't that be Yorkshire?) who shines. Mr Jacobi is his usual consummate self. John the sleepy, opportunist husband is brilliant as the modern male of a certain age and personality and Nicola Walker as the farmer achieves being able to turn her face inside out. Gumming I think they call it down that way. But it contains Bleak and Bitter-more Bronte than Summer Wine and the better for it. Poor title however.",1451606400,,1094,4.703125
