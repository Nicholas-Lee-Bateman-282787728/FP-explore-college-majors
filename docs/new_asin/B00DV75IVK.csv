5859260,5,B00DV75IVK,"Hes back!  Original lead singer Michael Sadler had been away for almost five years when he did the unthinkable, he rejoined the band. As a life long fan of Saga, this was a dream come true for me. Michael rejoined the band just in time for the groups new studio album 20/20 and just in time to show fans what they had been missing for almost five years. Live in Munich presents the final night of Saga's 2012 European tour that concluded in Germany. I wish I could have been there; it looked and sounded like a magical performance. Make no mistake this concert Blu-ray showcases Saga at their very best! Camera crews did a great job capturing this amazing performance.

Whether you're a casual or hard core fan of Saga or prog rock in general, this Blu-ray has a little something for everyone. First of all, you get the return of Michael Sadler; I could stop right there. Second, you get an amazing 19 song set list of new and old Saga classics with amazing picture and sound. Third, you get to see an amazing concert of the band at the top of their game during the final night of their tour. The level of musicianship is amazing, but its Michael Sadlers voice that really steals the show. Hearing Michael sing The Flyer and On the Loose live was worth the price of this Blu-ray for me. I hope there's more to come from ""Saga"" in the future.

5859261,5,B00DV75IVK,"I was very exited to hear about this disc. Sadly I hadn't been following this group since 10,000 days (which was a masterpiece) The group largely the same lineup since 1977 still produce music with the utmost substance in musicality and lyrical content. One of that handful of groups whose material now or on the past is timeless.",1388534400,,330,4.706896551724138
5859262,5,B00DV75IVK,"Killer dvd!
The boys are back!

Old and new songs are excellent.
Only 30 plus albums, this band rocks!

5859263,5,B00DV75IVK,"Good to see these guys back together with the original singer. They just weren't the same without Michael Sadler. The show focuses  mostly on their newer music which might not be as well known to some but it's good stuff. There's a few old standards thrown in too. The playing is good to very good from all the members and they seem to be enjoying themselves. Some very good musicianship going on here. Nothing fancy stage or light wise. Video is clean without and major flaws. A little bit of cut and pan but not bad. They make use of split screen too which is kinda cool. Lets you see 2 or 3 of them at the same time. Smaller interment club / theater setting. DTS HD is great. Bordering on superb! They don't put the surrounds to much use but the 5.1 DTS-HD is really really good.

HEY RUSH! Take an audio lesson from these guys!",1385078400,5,831,4.286624203821656
5859264,5,B00DV75IVK,WOW! That sums up this latest live release by Saga! Saga continues to grow yet keep their core sound much like Rush. While I was not a fan of their CD a few years back with a new singer to be fair it wasn't a bad effort just wasn't Saga just as Rush wouldn't be Rush without Geddy. Saga is one of the few bands that I can buy blindly without hearing previews first and know they won't disappoint!,1384128000,5,396,4.025316455696203

5859267,4,B00DV75IVK,"This is really a fantastic show of SAGA. The high skills of each one of the members of this great rock progressive band are shown on this fantastic DVD Concert. Also the Drum solo is outstanding so the really good lead guitar player.

The only thing that I am not sure about is the way to sing of the Singer of the band. His voice looks kind of off in some of the songs. Particulary in ""I am the flyer"". I do not know if this is because he sang this songs in this way or his voice was modified during the sound edition of this concert..",1420156800,,536,4.009345794392523

5859272,5,B00DV75IVK,"... and you'll have the idea.  If you ever liked Saga, at all, buy this.  Some modern concert videos from bands who have been performing for decades can be pretty depressing... you can see how far the musicians have fallen and it's painful to watch (you find yourself wishing you could have a modern HD recording of the band from 20 years ago, not today's sad version).

No problem here.  The performances are first rate... the vocalist Michael Sadler looks extremely fit and is in top form.  The sound, mix, and camera work is superb.  I'll say it again: if you ever liked Saga at all, buy this.",1407024000,,596,4.472222222222222
5859273,4,B00DV75IVK,"This is a well-made video, capturing the triumphant return of singer Michael Sadler to Saga's ranks.  Nice mix of new and old tracks with good quality video and excellent sound.  However, if you order the Eagle Vision (US domestic version) copy, it arrives in Ear Music (German label) packaging, noting that it is a PAL version, featuring only Dolby Digital and DTS sound.  The disc inside is actually an NTSC version with DTS-MA HD audio.  Apparently, to save money, Eagle and Ear Music have opted to use only the European cover for the Blu Ray box and slap an appropriate SKU number sticker on that cover for the Region 1 (NTSC) folks.  Bad move, because I returned this blu ray twice to other online vendors, thinking they had sent me the wrong copy.  I wonder how much this is costing Saga in sales.  Bottom line, if you're a Saga fan, get it.  Just don't let the packaging fool you.",1396051200,4,887,4.534591194968553
5859274,5,B00DV75IVK,"If you like Saga, this is a great package for the library. If you like (progressive rock/art rock/prog), but are not familiar with Saga, this is a good package to check out because the set list contains a good retrospective of their catalog. Those not necessarily into prog but into catchy melodies will also find plenty to enjoy here.

The audio is crisp and well balanced. The video is very good multi-angle/-camera, but be warned, the artists are not as young as we all once were (doesn't affect the performance in any way.. Just kinda striking to realize how looooong they've been doing this.

Worth the admission price, easily.",1395273600,,632,4.7889908256880735

8598201,5,B00DV75IVK,"If you were a major fan of those early MTV hits """"On The Loose"" and "" Wind Him Up"", as I was, this performance aptly displays the fact that these guys haven't lost a thing in all those years - they play like it's still 1983 and all members, including the original lead singer (sans 80's hair) are in superb form here. I've not watched this entire disc yet but I can hardly wait to get back to it!  Highly recommended!",1438387200,,417,4.148148148148148
