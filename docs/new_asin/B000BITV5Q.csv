8087067,5,B000BITV5Q,"""The Man From Texas"" (1939) Is An Excellent 1939 ""Golden Age Of Hollywood"" Cowboy Movie...Better Than STAGECOACH (1939)

--------------

This excellent, classic cowboy movie was made in 1939, a year often justifiably cited as the best year in Hollywood movie history.

The movie was made at Monogram Studios, one of the ""Poverty Row"" ""Gower Gulch"" small studios which did not own movie houses (all of the ""Major Studios"" did in 1939).

""The Man From Texas"" (1939) is a fast paced, interesting, believable, well acted, well written, well directed movie which includes good cowboy songs sung by Tex Ritter who did a wonderful job as ""Tex Allen,"" the protagonist, lead character in the story.

This wonderful movie is much better, less sappy, more believable, and less contrived than ""Stagecoach"" (1939) which is often wrongfully cited as ""the best western ever made"" and ""the best western made in 1939.""

""The Man From Texas"" (1939) starring Tex Ritter got lost in movie history, as did other movies not made by ""the Majors,"" which also control important (and expensive) movie publicity and organizations of fame (including The American Film Institute and the Motion Picture Producers of America).

The movie is now in the Public Domain, and is available inexpensively in DVD form. It is not restored, but should be.

Hooray for good movies like ""The Man From Texas"" (1939) which should have been honored but were not due to the politics of Hollywood, and the power of big money which has always controlled Hollywood.

This movie ""slipped through the cracks,"" but is worth obtaining and screening often. Huge talent both in front of the camera and behind it went into the making of ""The Man From Texas"" (1939).

It is a great western movie.",1423267200,,1738,4.962068965517242
