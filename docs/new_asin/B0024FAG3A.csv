3845969,4,B0024FAG3A,"The Craft is original, fresh, and smart. Three witches are in desperate need of a fourth member to complete their coven and when the new student comes to school they all can make things happen but soon find trouble happening when their power is misused. The Craft isn't a Hocus Pocus kind of witch movie which is good in it's own case but I believe they leaned this movie more torwards Wicca which is different for movies. The bluray is fantastic with good audio and amazing picture quality. Special Features are pretty good with interviews and how the development for the movie began. A really good buy.",1387411200,3,604,4.654205607476635

3845974,3,B0024FAG3A,"Teen angst movies are rarely realistic, and more rarely cast actual teenagers. A gaggle of twenty-somethings working through their collective angst with witchcraft is about as far-fetched as you can get. I'd willing to accept all of this if the film were clever or atmospheric, but it achieves neither, opting for a TV-style, by-the-numbers approach. It could have been so much more.

The story features four outcast girls (the sad, pouting Robin Tunney, the 29-year-old Rachel True, the mightily-boobed Neve Campbell, and the absolutely dee-lish Fairuza Balk) who come together to invoke the spirit of Manon (as sort-of universal deity with unlimited power) in order to satisfy their petty desires. Low-wattage drama with not one shred of an epic moment follows.

I liked this film when I saw it in the cinema as a teenager, mainly because of the yummy girls. As an adult I can see that the film has lots of lame dialogue, bad editing, and poor photography. Revenge fantasies, especially for high school kids, are cliched and old-fashioned as well as being dangerous. There's not much reason to watch this other than ogling the skin on show.

Why this got an R-rating is beyond me. Apparently the MPAA regarded the witchcraft to be dangerous and insisted on an R when the film is clearly no harder than a PG-13. I think this is absolutely moronic. With their logic Harry Potter and Charmed should be for adults only.

The Blu Ray features a thoroughly average 1.85:1 1080p transfer and a DTS HD-MA soundtrack. All the extras from the DVD have been ported over.",1334361600,2,1561,4.879245283018868
3845975,5,B0024FAG3A,"After repeated viewings, Craft retains power and interest. Two DVDs and the BD; I should be bored; but it plays to stay. Medium power film has roots and style a'plenty with weird ways mixed with mundane. Great Playlist and a ride. BD has DTS power and great pic (soft by nature)",1255564800,2,278,4.470588235294118
3845976,4,B0024FAG3A,"In 1996, with a plethora of teen horror movies coming out to theaters, one supernatural film that stood out was ""The Craft"".

The film was directed by Andrew Fleming (""Grosse Pointe"", ""Paranormal Girl"", ""Dick"") and featured a story written by Peter Filardi (""Flatliners"", ""Salem's Lot"").  Joining the two are composer Grame Revell (""Pineapple Express"", ""The Ruins"", ""The Condemned"", ""Eleventh Hour"") and cinematographer Alexander Gruszynski (""The In-Laws"", ""Nancy Drew"" and ""Madea Goes to Jail"").

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""The Craft"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  For a film that was released in 1996, ""The Craft"" actually looks good for being nearly 13-years-old.  The film is not exactly vibrant nor do you see tons of detail but the film does manage to retain the film's grain and blacks are nice and deep.  If anything, outdoor scenes manages to look nice, colorful and bright but for the most part, it's a good transfer but nothing that would be scene as reference or spectacular.

As for audio, this is where things get interesting.  ""The Craft"" is one of the few Blu-ray releases in 2009 from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment to utilize an a 5.1 DTS-HD MA lossless track instead of DolbyTrue HD.  The film gives a choice of English, French and Portuguese lossless tracks but what I was truly impressed by is how immersive the soundtrack for this film was.

So far, Sony has done a good job of bringing out the audio track for 90's films this year such as ""Air Force One"" and now, the same can be said with ""The Craft"".  From lighting, to rain, ambient noises, conversations in the background and crickets, you hear it utilized quite nicely through the surround channels.

The sound effects really are utilized through the surround channels.  So, the film goes beyond the front and center channel speakers for dialogue and music.  Also, you'll notice some scenes utilizing LFE quite a bit, so overall, fans of the film will truly enjoy the lossless soundtrack of ""The Craft"".

Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese, Koeran and Thai.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""The Craft"" comes with the following special features (all presented in standard definition and in English stereo/English Mono with English, Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese and Thai subtitles):

  *
  * Director's Commentary - Director Andrew Fleming's audio commentary about ""The Craft"".  Fleming is good at discussing certain parts of the film and how they had a technical adviser who runs a large covenant of witches, thus lending accuracy to the film.
  * Conjuring the Craft - (24:33) A featurette featuring the screenwriter, director and producer along with the talent talking about the film and their experiences on working about the film.  Also, how the crew hired an actual witch to help in the consulting of the film.
  * The Original ""Behind the Scenes of The Craft"" - (6:00) Featuring the cast and director talking about the film and their characters.  Plus clips from the film.
  * Deleted Scenes with Optional Commentary - Deleted scenes which include: Healing Bonnie, Confrontation and Nancy performs magic.  Optional commentary of why the scenes were cut by Director Andrew Fleming.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The Craft"" was a pretty solid supernatural thriller back in 1996 and even over a decade later, the film continues to be entertaining and fun.  Nor does it try to approach the supernatural or witchcraft storyline in a lame manner.

For the most part, very solid performances by Fairuza Balk, Robin Tunney, Neve Campbell and Rachel True.  The film was before Neve Campbell became well-known for ""Party of Five"" and Fairuza Balk before ""The Waterboy"" but the crew did a good job in selecting Fairuza Balk (who is familiar with wicka) as the main antagonist of the film.  Balk somehow has this dark look to her in the film but for the most part, she did a fantastic job portraying Nancy Downs.  It was interesting to find out through the special features that Balk was familiar with witchcraft and that the director and producers felt that she embodied the role of Nancy.  And of course, for the role of our main protagonist, Robin Tunney did a fantastic job playing the role of the protagonist Sarah Bailey.

""The Craft"" definitely receives a solid picture and audio transfer.  But as mentioned in the video & audio portion, the fact that Sony Pictures Home Entertainment is testing out the DTS-HD Master Audio codec with this release is quite interesting.  I am starting to prefer the DTS-HD Master Audio for lossless audio and for this film, it definitely made the film much more enjoyable as the sound effects really utilize the surround channels.  In fact, one time I thought there was a cricket in my house but it was actually from the film.

Overall, ""The Craft"" was an enjoyable film featuring a solid screenplay, good choice of casting and for the most part, giving an edge to this dark teenage film. Although the film is Rated-R, the film is by no means is ""The Craft"" a slasher film nor is their nudity.  But for fans who truly enjoyed this film, ""The Craft"" definitely gets a solid HD release on Blu-ray.  Definitely worth checking out!",1255392000,40,5175,4.935185185185185

3845991,3,B0024FAG3A,"Starts off strong and then deteriorates into a mildly entertaining tale of a coven of witches.  There are components that work well, a likable cast, campy effects, a great soundtrack and a particularly memorable scene involving creepy critters, but all of that is derailed by some terribly inconsistent characters. Might work well for teenage girls or if you're looking for a nostalgic trip to the 90s. - Worth Watching

Overall, it's the story of good versus evil with regard to magic with Robin being the good witch and Fairuza indulging in black magic. The special effects are excellent and this movie is one that I usually play during Halloween. It is suspenseful and a little scary, even after having seen it many times. I highly recommend this film, especially in the Blu-Ray format.",1423440000,,527,4.802197802197802
