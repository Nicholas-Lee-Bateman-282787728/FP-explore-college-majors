3823111,5,B001VNPHW6,I now have 4 DVD's from Leerburg Kennels. Ed Frawley is one the the best dog trainers out there. He has put together some great DVD's that breakdown training into manageable steps that the novice can follow. And what I respect and value most about his training is that he uses a lot of common sense. I have a trainer that comes to my house and she cannot believe how well trained my Australian Shepard is. And the dog loves the training.,1265587200,9,437,4.341463414634147

8346654,5,B001VNPHW6,"good product. Ed Frawley has become an almost completely positive trainer. He takes the simple concept of rewarding with food reward (which he had in his previous videos by the way) and he now acknowledges that the clicker, or the marker word ""yes"" can be used to expand timing of a reward. He also expands to include the training concept of a ""reactive"" dog, that has been pushed into the down, or the stay, or the stand, or the down-stay, instead into the ""active"" dog, that is seeking to learn, versus afraid of making mistakes for fear of a correction. He takes what was training by ""showing"" the dog by manipulating the dog into the correct position, instead into a guessing game, that the dog learns by induction.  He explains it very, very clearly. To see Ed do it is very impressive, because a lot of the sport dog trainers stayed away from Marker training for a long time and Ed acknowledges that his views and methods have changed. He has excellent diction and explanation skills. Good product.",1416182400,,1004,4.640449438202247
8346655,1,B001VNPHW6,Not very practical. Consists of a long and tedious unscripted monologue.,1410566400,,72,5.636363636363637
8346656,2,B001VNPHW6,"I gave it two stars because the man states that the old fashioned way of training dogs was wrong. But then he loses me when he states categorically that a dog is motivated only by what makes him ""comfortable"" ""he does things for himself, not for you.""

Well, do I have news for you, Mr Leerburg! Scientists believe the same thing about humans. Humans are motivated by the need for sex, food, money, power, whatever economic advantage they can get. All of it comes down to self-interest (you want to feel good, or ""comfortable"").

And how does that knowledge help us educate our children or train our dogs? It does not. On the contrary, if you were to consider cold, scientific facts, you would dump your kids in a dumpster and get on with your life. The likelihood of them hanging around to love and comfort you in your old age is not borne out by statistics.

Of course a dog does things because he wants a treat (as do children, as do adults, as does your spouse or lover). But then, after that, Mr Leerburg, the dog will do it even if you have no treats on you at all. He will do it for free.

If a psychologist could have regular conversations with your dog over a period of months, the psychologist might discover your dog's true, selfish motivation:

 The dog might just get physical enjoyment out of the movement (like a dancer or gymnast enjoys movement).
 The dog might just enjoy feeling clever, and enjoys showing off.
 The dog might enjoy the interaction with its owner (and you don't have to call that love if you don't want to)
 The dog might like the happiness it senses in your vocal and body language and that means you will look after it and good things will come its way, like food (if the dog is concerned about where its next meal will come from - what sort of dog owner does that make you, anyway?)
 The dog might selfishly and calculatingly be thinking of its old age and that it is in its own interests to please you so that you will keep it comfortable when it can no longer jump the hoop and impress your friends.
 The dog might be worried that you would think it is stupid and return it to the dog pound.

But since dogs can't talk, we will never know.

By the way, did you know that top human athletes are also trained by clicker? E.g. pole vaulting. The old-fashioned coach can stand on the ground, shouting instructions, and watch his athlete try and try again. All he can say is that ""you almost did it right."" However, a modern coach with a clicker can convey far more information. The minute the athlete's body position in mid-air approximates the correct position, the coach clicks. The athlete knows that at that instant his body position was correct. The coach keeps watching successive tries and clicks as the athlete more and more closely approximates the correct body position. Would it help the coach to know that the athlete is doing so purely out of self-interest?

""Hey, Coach, don't give me any soppy stories about how your athlete will do anything for you out of devotion. Only stupid, unscientific people talk like that."" The coach would answer: I want my athlete to be motivated by the drive for success and achievement. Nothing else.

The clicker is like playing ""hot and cold"" with your dog: you're getting closer, ah, no, you're moving away.

Once my dog understands what I want her to do, I no longer need the clicker or the treat to get her to do anything; I just say the word that she associates with that trick. She does tricks because she likes it. I don't know why and it is not important to me why. Even when I'm too tired when I get home, she will nag me until I take five minutes to do some tricks with her. Of course she's doing it for herself. Of course she gives a damn that I've had a hard day at work and just want to slump down on the couch with a glass of wine. She wants to do tricks for her own reasons.

If you want to know about dog training, I would rather suggest Dr Sophia Yin's books and DVDs. In a fascinating DVD she demonstrates how quickly they train chickens to perform all sorts of tricks. Once you've seen that, you know you can teach your pooch anything. And does it really matter if the pooch does so for its own reasons?

It is terribly sad that the fear of being accused of anthropomorphism has led to cruelty to animals. Mental cruelty is actually advocated by dog trainers because it is ""unscientific"" to assume an animal has feelings. Since animals cannot be assumed to have emotions like ours, we cannot assume that they suffer the mental pain that we do.

Well, if it is unscientific to assume that a dog has something, then it is just as unscientific to assume that the dog does not have that something.

Anthropomorphism is not a mortal sin. In fact, there is a risk when scientists assume that only humans possess any degree of certain traits. This assumption is called anthropocentrism, an outlook of human exceptionalism. Darwin  to the chagrin of many religious philosophers  dismissed these ideas of human exceptionalism in his book The Descent of Man by saying that our differences are ""only in degree and not in kind.""",1393718400,3,5117,4.45610278372591
8346657,4,B001VNPHW6,Very clear instructions to teaching dogs how to work with markers and proceed to more advanced obedience. It will work with either clicker or toys.,1386892800,3,147,4.92
8346658,5,B001VNPHW6,"It's not all about ""clickers"". It is a long video but it is a thorough video. I have watched it twice so far - yes, I will be viewing it again as it is a training video FOR PEOPLE !
Not for your dog to watch (although mine did sit through most of the 2 I purchased) It is not about how to train a puppy but rather more towards a mature dog. Mine was from a local shelter and he is responding well ! There are other training books and videos but this should be one of yours !",1376697600,2,474,3.75
8346659,4,B001VNPHW6,"Pros: Really terrific positive training techniques. Very thorough/long. Almost entirely positive. Negative markers are gentle ""nopes"" - your tone is more important than the word. Negative markers, when done right, will motivate your dog to try again. Solid train-the-trainer instruction techniques.

Cons: Many people will be put off by the length (hours and hours and hours). I was at first. But as I asked myself what I would edit out, I decided I wouldn't edit out anything. Yes, he repeats himself and you can rewind (you can also fast forward :). When he repeats himself, he's telling you this is important. I see that as a good teaching technique. Even though we all think we get it the first time, research shows we need to hear/see/do it 7 times to anchor it in. Dogs need it repeated 30 times (quoting the video - seems about right to me). Also, he shamelessly plugs Leerburg products, such as leashes, but its in the context of discussing pros/cons of various types of products. So that's OK (especially if it allows them to sell the DVDs for less).

Bottom line: I seriously considered pet warehouse training prior to buying this DVD. I'm (very) glad I bought this video first. I have friends who spent $150-$200 for one dog to attend pet warehouse training and got practically nothing out of it. I have two dogs, so double that price. I have already seen benefits from this video (and application, of course). With that said, the video recommends taking your dog to a pet warehouse training class AFTER training them in a low-distraction environment (namely home). The training classes provide a distraction-filled environment which is an excellent place to reinforce what they already know, this time with many distractions. Finally, don't try to watch this long video in one setting. Break it into chapters and make use of rewind and fast-forward. You and your dog will be glad you did!",1363478400,8,1900,4.861111111111111
8346660,5,B001VNPHW6,"Between all in person, written and video base instruction on dog training this one is by far the most useful I have found. The instructions on the method of marker training are easy to follow and build well from one lesson to the next. There is enough repetition to let the lessons sink in, but not so much that it gets boring.",1357171200,5,327,4.290322580645161
8346661,4,B001VNPHW6,Leerburg DVD on clickers provide great information on how to use clickers so that your pet respond to them. I couldn't be more happy that I have bought this. Information is knowledge. This DVD IS VERY WELL MADE!,1356307200,,211,4.578947368421052
8346662,5,B001VNPHW6,"This is a wonderful DVD. I have trained with markers before but this
DVD went way into the whys and hows to train your dog using markers. I use both
clicker and voice depending on what I am training my dog for. The use of
many trainers working their dogs is helpful.",1320364800,,266,4.134615384615385
