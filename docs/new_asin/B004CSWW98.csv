We also need to take in consideration that the demand for this set is most likely not all that great. I wonder if the Timeless Media Group listed Peter (not Leonard) Graves as the narrator on the 2-disc case to see if someone would notice; I did.
 I do really enjoy these because it reminds me of sitting with my dad in front of a black and white G.E television set and watching them, when they were 1st shown, back in the day.

4329153,4,B004CSWW98,"Emmy winning VICTORY AT SEA originally aired Sunday afternoons on the NBC network. It was the creation of Harry Salomon, a former Navy man who had assisted in writing a 15 volume&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/History-of-United-States-Naval-Operations-in-World-War-II/dp/0762854316/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">History of United States Naval Operations in World War II</a>. Technical advice for the series was provided by Walter Karig, an ex-Navy captain who also authored WWII volumes, but is best remembered, especially by fans of producer/director William Castle, for his 1947 novel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ZOTZ/dp/B00005Y0HR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ZOTZ!</a>

Broadway's Richard Rodgers provided twelve themes for this series. In 1953, Rodgers and lyricist Oscar Hammerstein used his ""Beneath the Southern Cross"" theme (heard in three episodes) for their musical&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ME-AND-JULIET/dp/B000TJ71FY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ME AND JULIET</a>, as the song ""No Other Love (Have I)."" It was that show's most memorable tune.

Robert Russell Bennett fleshed out Rodgers piano compositions for the NBC Symphony orchestra. Much has been made of this program's score (the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/soundtrack-LP/dp/B0000064X9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">soundtrack LP</a>&nbsp;was a favorite of Pres. Nixon, for example), but I think it's intrusively LOUD and gets lowered only when narrator Leonard Graves speaks.

The strongest element of VICTORY AT SEA is its newsreel and other actual war footage, gathered from Allied and former enemy sources around the world. The best episode visually may be #25, which shows several kamikaze pilots crashing into Navy vessels. All episodes however are exceptional examples of how television can be used to educate and inform. Prior to VICTORY AT SEA, there had been no TV documentary series, and its success assured the future of this vital format. (These 26 chapters continued in syndicated reruns for almost 15 years after their first airing.)

My response is doubtless influenced by these factors. Yes, the narrative is a bit over the top, and it is partly propaganda. However, it is appropriate for the time. My brother served in the Korean War and it probably hit him at a deep level.

There is a small section of the score that is transcendental. When I watched the film I saw that it corresponded to the end of the battle on Guadalcanal which was the turning point in the island land war. The musical score is a masterpiece by Richard Rodgers. I would urge people to buy the two CDs which stand on their own.

I bought the HBO series ""The Pacific"" which is superb. Having lived in Puerto Rico and Hawaii, I can't imagine the courage and stamina that our Marines faced.

4329163,2,B004CSWW98,"Poor Quality Transfer to DVD by Timeless Media Group

This is a 2 DVD video set in a rectangular metal container marketed by Timeless Media Group.

Ten or fifteen years ago I purchased the ""Victory at Sea"" documentary set in VHS and if my memory serves me correct that was a much better transfer from film to video. This set is the original ""Victory at Sea"" documentary by National Broadcasting Corporation produced in 1952 but it is a poor transfer in that it is very low contrast. Believe it or not it appears that the transfer was made by video copying a screen projection in a lighted room. Remember when you were a kid watching a lousy film in history class and the room wasn't dark enough, to see the film? That's what this DVD looks like. You keep wanting to yell ""turn the damn lights off."" Low contrast means that the black areas of a scene are not black but gray and the whites are not white but light gray which makes all the scenes look like they were filmed in fog. A blurry washed out effect is the result. Another thing is the company that markets this version did not clean up the dust specs, scratches and other film defects resulting from age and poor storage of the original film. Again, this transfer is bad.

The ""DVD features"" stating Full Screen Presentation"" is misleading since this Documentary was produced for Television format in the early 50s and my copy is most definitely not a ""Full Screen Presentation"" by today's standards. It is old TV broadcast standard 1.33:1. Another thing is that Leonard Graves supposedly ""introduces each episode with analysis of tactics and strategies."" Well Leonard Graves is no where to be seen or heard, at lest not on the first DVD. I didn't bother to even look at the second DVD since the first was so poorly done.

I remember, as a young boy, seeing the ""Victory at Sea"" documentary when it first aired back in the early 50s and the many reruns over the next ten or fifteen years as I was growing up. The documentary is in it self interesting history. Since the documentary was produced so soon after WWII there are some inaccuracies mostly resulting from ignorance of the facts. In subsequent years as more information has been gathered by historians a lot of those inaccuracies and omissions of fact have come to light. For instance one of the 26 minute segments is titled ""Midway"" but the episode really only directly addresses the Battle of Midway, both the island and sea battle, for about 15 minutes and most of that is many, many stock shots of various Japanese and American naval aircraft in various configurations and modes of operation with dramatic background music provided by the NBC orchestra. Practically no information about the planning or execution of the battle is presented because at the time the documentary was produced much of the Battle of Midway was still a mystery as to what happened and especially why.

Reviewing this DVD surprised me at how many times the same film clip was splice in over and over again as filler (in the orginal production). For instance the same scene of a German bomber dropping a stick of bombs would be played over and over again, sometimes as many as 4 or 5 times, and in some cases with the film flipped so it would appear that the bomber was a different one coming from another direction. This was not so apparent when watching the original programs on TV but now that we have it on video we can stop action and play scenes in slow motion to verify what we ""thought we saw."" Yep same scene played 5 times and flipped once, all in a 45 second clip!

I was also surprised at how much of the aviation and naval scenes were faked using model airplanes and ships some of which I think I recognized from some of the old low budget WWII propaganda movies. There were a lot of models of planes and ships used in the Pearl Harbor and Midway episodes. Some were so obviously faked that it was embarrassing but then again some of the model scenes were surprisingly well done.

Another side note as to the historicity of the Documentary itself that I find interesting is that the 30 minute programs were a full 26 minutes long including the opening and closing title and credit sequences. That leaves only a total of 4 minutes for commercials for a 30 minute program. I always suspected that the percentage of commercial time to programming had risen over the years.

Too sum up, I would pass on this version of ""Victory at Sea"" and look for another transfer, but then, all of the above is just my opinion.",1347667200,9,4516,4.552955665024631
4329164,2,B004CSWW98,"When I was looking through the reviews before I got this, I saw that one of the two-star reviews described this series about WWII as `dated'. I thought it was a candidate for the dumbest review ever: it's about a war that ended more than 65 years ago and is based on actual footage -- of course it's dated!

Having watched it, I'd have to say that the first word that comes to mind to describe it is. . . dated. What do I mean by that? Two things.

First, it's still part of the era of newsreels. The depiction of the war is still in propaganda mode. ""Fascism,"" the narrator growls early on, ""must kill to survive."" Most of the footage has a strong nationalistic feel to it. The white Allied soldiers, who are very heroic, look like their mugs were picked on the basis of looks. All of them. And the way they're shown makes it's very easy to imagine in many of the noncombat shots that an officer is standing beside the cameraman going, ""Look lively for people at home, boys!""

The heavily mannered narration, which sounds like it was written with a thesaurus of classical rhetorical technique beside the typewriter (very heavy on repetition), stresses the endurance and courage of the soldiers in a rather self-congratulatory way: ""If there was horror and ferocity, there was also courage and self-sacrifice. If there was death, filth, and disease, the Marines turned the tide of war and stopped their enemy."" But the images are still pretty sanitary: there are relatively few bodies and even fewer missing limbs or other things that could worry the home front.

The second way the series feels dated is its naivete. No one today, for instance, would recycle the same shot of a dive-bomber tipping its nose down three times in one episode. That's seen as clumsy these days. More important, the series was edited to the point of essentially being turned into fiction. Early, we see sequence that goes something like this: a German submarine captain is looking into a periscope. Cut to a freighter being seen through a periscope. Cut to the periscope sticking above the water. Cut to men putting a torpedo in a launch tube. Cut to a torpedo racing along underwater. Back to the periscope image of the freighter being hit by a torpedo. The implication is that these all happened together. That German captain fired that torpedo which hit that freighter. But at some point, you realize that these different pieces of footage aren't necessarily even from the same year. And that torpedo might have been American.

As you become more and more aware of the editing and the placement of cameras, the more you realize that there isn't necessarily that much actual combat footage here. A fair amount of it could be the filming of drills and such. The most consistent exception is the showing of bombs hitting the ground (as cameras could stably be mounted in the bombers) and the more harrowing exception is the ship-side view of the kamikazes. The one funny exception is a man we're told is a British commando on a raid in Norway using a plunger detonator to blow up a shack.  You can see the shockwave fly out and knock the guy onto to his derriere. But generally, the images aren't that great. Most of them flash before the screen so briefly you can barely focus on them anyway.

In short, it's probably not worth twelve hours of your life watching this. Sure, it was a big deal when it came out in the 1950s, especially to anyone not old enough to remember much of the war proper (like my father who has fond memories of the series). I don't think there was anything like it at the time. But whatever desire you have to see such propaganda footage -- you can get your fix on youtube. I only learned things in snippets, like the laying of the gas pipe to China along the Burma Road. (Indeed, as I get older, I'm less interested in the battles and more impressed by the sheer logistics of the whole thing, especially the global American effort.)",1346025600,5,3938,4.593172119487909
