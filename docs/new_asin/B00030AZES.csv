8035634,2,B00030AZES,"I had been jonesing for a good new Werewolf movie that i haven't seen yet, so I typed Werewolf into the old Amazon search engine and this one came up. Seeing only one review I felt i had to at least give it a shot.

First off, I should tell you this isn't some high budget horror movie, which is kind of a joke on it's own, but this is close to a homemade film, that was written, directed, produced and starring Brett Kelly. Being under the impression I was seeing a werewolf movie, it was kind of bummer not having any physical transformation in the movie, but i will have to say it was an interesting twist to the story.

Secondly, since this is kind of a self-made horror movie I guess Brett didn't really have too many options with actors, some of these people are laughably bad (especially the lady walking the dog) but knowing most horror movies do have somewhat of a sense of humor, you can take it in stride and laugh a bit.

Lastly, the movie is really short, the running time says it's about 64 minutes but between the credits it's more like 40-45. I guess that's a good thing, they didn't fill the movie with unnecessary filler.

Overall, while it's not really what i was getting it wasn't really that bad.",1177718400,,1217,4.324561403508772
8035635,1,B00030AZES,The Feral Man has a running time of 64min.  The first 51 min is a tedious rip off of the time and money of the audience. NO SEX NO VIOLENCE AND ABSOLUTELY NO SEX + VIOLENCE AT THE SAME TIME The plot is so boring it makes Warhols film SLEEP look thrilling by comparison. The Feral Man delivers ABSOLUTELY nothing that horror fans hope for when they push the play button. The Perfect Storm of audience rip offs. At 51 min the whole boring mess falls on its face for the last time the screen goes dark and at last a suspenceful moment has arrived what will happen for the next 13 mins? The credits come on and for the entire THIRTEEN astouding mins the slowest credit roll in the history of cinema drags on.  If seemingly endless credits are enough to amuse you see it if not avoid The Feral Man,1135468800,3,792,4.203947368421052
