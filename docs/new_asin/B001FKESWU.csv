8302105,1,B001FKESWU,"This media wasn't recognized on any of my players.  I have a new Asus BR r/w on my computer, a new Panasonic BR player in my Home Theater and neither recognize it.

It appears to be corrupted or totally fake rip off.

Waste of money.",1392422400,,233,4.133333333333334
8302106,1,B001FKESWU,"I got this because it promised blu-ray surround sound in an immersive field.  Well it is surround sound.
It is not immersive, it's pretty uninspired, and the music sucks.  It's electro disco music accompanied by some OK images of fantastic paintings/illustrations.  No problem with them, except they are as cliched as the music.

I would not even give this away to somebody else.",1310601600,2,379,4.968253968253968
8302107,1,B001FKESWU,"i just receive the product,and was a big disappointment.

I have been loyal to amazon customer for years now,and this one was a big disappointment.
returning the products i will get 50%only and i have to pay for the shipment.

i think this product is a big  rip off to the customers.
i did not expect amazon to sell copy disks(not original) for the price you pay",1289606400,2,447,4.493827160493828
8302108,1,B001FKESWU,"I ignored comments about compatibility problems with Samsung Blueray players thinking my model was likely new enough and up-to-date enough to play the disc. Well sort of... Every single track contains portions that hang my Blueray player. I have to manually skip forward up to a minute in order to resume listening. For this reason I'm returning the disc to Amazon for credit.

On the content of the disc I have to call BS on all the great reviews. I listen to a lot of electronic music and this is really some of the most boring and banal I've heard in recent memory.

For $30 + shipping I expected a whole lot more. Sorry - one star only.",1281484800,3,640,4.415254237288136
8302109,1,B001FKESWU,"I tried listen at Playstation 3, at my desktop and at Samsung blu ray player. No sucess. I have 32 BD discs e this is only with problems.",1272153600,,137,3.9285714285714284
8302110,1,B001FKESWU,"As for the BD ""The way to paradise,"" I got broken in half due to the fragile package that was sent. He was anxious to hear him, and unfortunately does not run.
As for ""Chris Botti"" to date not received. I am arranging to return the database to paradise The way to see if I get another or the removal of the product with the return of the purchase price, including shipping.

8302111,1,B001FKESWU,"I've ordered two copies with great excitement over the style of recording only to be disappointed that the DVD will not play.  It's stated to be a blu-ray, but is not.  I have a Panasonic DMP-BD80 ($400.00 Blu-ray player) and it will not play.  I'm very disappointed with this experience.  Also the quality looks like someone is burning and labelling this product from a home office and tossing it in a Blu-ray case.

Over all experience with this process has been 1 out of 10.",1269561600,3,477,4.564705882352941
8302112,5,B001FKESWU,I bought this used on Amazon. Significant because it's recorded in a high end HD format (7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio). Use it to test your blu-ray audio playback. Every home theater should have a variety of test discs handy. You can't rent these from Netflix. Save your money and buy one used at half price.,1261180800,4,303,4.527272727272727
8302113,3,B001FKESWU,"Brought this BR disc hoping to be spun out in real 5.1 surround sound.
As far as the multi dimensional sound aspect went, I felt that it lacks ""oomph"".
There is a couple of drop-outs (30 seconds each or so) on the disc that considering the cost etc to get it delivered to this part of the world is disappointing.
I will try one more of this BR disc application (an established classical piece) to see if that turns on the juices.",1228003200,4,429,4.2439024390243905
