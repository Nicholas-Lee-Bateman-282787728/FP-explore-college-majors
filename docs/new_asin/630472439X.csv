7876869,2,630472439X,I purchased this DVD because is was titled beyond basics This DVD should be called pre basics not beyond basics. gee's!,1320019200,,119,4.714285714285714
7876870,5,630472439X,"This DVD was the very first instructional tape I bought. I have since purchased others and overall, this is the best for beginers-intermediate. Brush up on the basic chord scheme before viewing and you'll be fine. Mr. Wyatt is an EXCELLENT instructor - patient, easy going and comprehensive. If you are as interested in the old blues as I am then this is a must have to get you going.",1211414400,3,384,4.5
7876871,4,630472439X,"This video features Keith Wyatt who is an accomplished guitarist and excellent instructor.  Keith appears in many guitar instruction videos.

He starts off introducing the I-IV-V blues progression and teaches the progression in the key of E using open position 7 chords.  He also shows the student how to spice up the progression using embellishments and base notes.  The second section Keith teaches the blues shuffle in the key of E and again shows the student how to spice up the progression with embellishments and base notes.  He also demonstrates some very basic turnarounds.  At the end he introduces the use of a capo but doesn't go into much detail.

He leaves the student not only with the ability to play some pretty cool sounding blues progressions but with some tools and advice that the student can use to play around and develop additional embellishments.

All of the material is very, very simple and straightforward.  It does not cover soloing or anything very technical.  A beginning guitar student could get a lot out of this.  An intermediate student who has no experience with acoustic style blues guitar can also learn a few tricks and have some fun going through the material.",1161820800,4,1199,4.91542288557214
7876872,1,630472439X,"If you have trouble remembering that the guitar should be held with the sound hole facing forward, or don't really understand what a flat pick is-- well this is the DVD for you.

There is nothing but nothing here. Tuning the guitar, a reminder that there is a difference between an acoustic and an electric, a review of flat picks and how some are thick and some are thin.

Ever know one of those annoying guitar ""teachers"" who shows you how to strum up and down and then lauches into his own special lick- which he then never shows you how to play?  This is one of those guys.

half an hour and $17 dollars later- it's a total and complete waste of time.",1144022400,2,655,4.258064516129032

7876874,4,630472439X,"The tape started off very good.

I learned some basic structure of 12 bar blues and some alternate fingering for blues chords.

However, just as I was getting the rythm down, the instructor started to introduce some filler notes between chords and that's when the instructor went much too fast for me to catch on.

Beginning starts basic and then goes into hyperspace as if the insrtuctor is running out of time.",1108425600,,412,4.694444444444445
7876875,5,630472439X,"Great for blues beginners.
Keith is a very good teacher.
I recommed the tape to anyone who plays guitar (basics) and wants to enter the blues world.",1017705600,4,148,4.518518518518518
