8146017,3,B000IJX8HU,Content is fine. Quality is very poor. I had to reset the pixel quality so many times I lost count. Not  easy to do with a room full of 8-year-olds. Don't think I'll buy this again.,1366502400,,181,4.027777777777778
8146018,5,B000IJX8HU,"My four year old is learning sign language but doesn't know anyone who is deaf personally. We wanted her to understand the importance of paying attention to the way she signs, so that she will be able to properly communicate when the opportunity arises. We bought this dvd hoping that it would be a gentle way of showing her how blessed she is having all her senses, and just like Helen she can overcome any obstacle. We watched it together the first time to make sure she understood what was happening and answer any questions she had. She enjoyed it and has watched it several times on her own since then.",1365292800,2,607,4.4774774774774775
8146019,5,B000IJX8HU,"This video has been my child's favorite since she was a toddler. She always has questions about Helen Keller, therefor, it is quite an educational experience when she watches it. It is a short video that briefly describes the difficulties and triumphs of Keller as a child. I highly recommend this video for children and parents who want to gain compassion for those who are different from us, or to get motivation when we face our own struggles and difficulties in life.",1320278400,5,471,4.7560975609756095
