7899476,1,6305976392,"I once heard that even the worst movies get sequels. Never was that so evident as in this moronic, stupid, dumb, insepid, hidious excuse for a movie. I asked in the review of the first one 'why was this movie made?' and as good of a question as that was it is even more needed here. The story is more like Nightmare On Elm Street than horror/slasher and one of the survivors from the first film Courtney Bates (PLayed by a young and pre-Wings Crystal Bernard) dreams about The Driller Killer
and when her and some bearly clothed friends go to a cabin for vacation The Driller Killer leaps from her dreams and into reality for a little mayhem. Now lets forget the fact that this is a sequel and focus on the movie. It's really dumb. The fact that it is a sequel of an even worse film just makes it that more painful to watch. The one thing I will give this film is that I never thought that they wanted to take themselves to seriously. If they did then they would have some explaining to do about the musical number ""Lets Buzzzzzz"". However even if it was taken simply for camp it failed there as well. The killer is dressed like a fifty's rocker and his drill is pratruding out of the end of a guitar. The cover artwork is just the drill in the movie. After watching this movie you may feel dumber. Don't worry, just remember that you are not the one who made this film, and the ones who did shoud hide in shame. Much like the first one if you are looking for a movie to laugh at at a party than you may want to rent both of these films. But be warned watching these movies back to back may actually lower your IQ.....",1017619200,2,1618,4.189102564102564

Then Courtney's nightmares and hallucinations turn real and a new gory massacre begins. Rent this Science Fiction Horror Fantasy Thriller tonight.,985996800,6,505,5.170731707317073
7899478,2,6305976392,"This movie needs a soundtrack. This movie has some great catchy toons on it such as ""tokyo convertible"", ""why do you want more"" and ""let's roll"" but the the downside about this movie is... that it is just plain stupid!!!! Heres a lead. A guy with an electric guitar which has an drill attached to the end, and goes around singing and dancing and killing all at the same time. If you can figure out why please e-mail me. With an ending which is more confusing than a labyrinth. But this movie is not supposed to be picked judged on plot, or plausibility, it is supposed to be just for fun, and it does entertain although i am not sure it's intention was to make us laugh. Crystal Bernard's debut... I am not saying anything",974937600,,722,4.355555555555555
7899479,4,6305976392,"I love this movie the way it combines dream sequences like the ones they used in Nightmare on Elm Street with your tipical slasher movie. The songs in this film were great I expecially like the one the Driller Killer sings  right before he kills a female victim. Crystal Bernard of the tv show Wings  should be put into the scream queen hall of fame, because she scream's alot  and does it very well.  Ok the story fallows the only simi sane survivor  for the fist film Courtney (Bernard) while she and her rock band friends go  away for a slumber party weekend at a house in a area they are still  developing. After getting there some boys show and and stay with them. But  Courtney keeps having nightmares that a killer with a large drill on the  end of his guttar is after her sister and her. The dreams tell her not to  do a certin act because if she does he will comeout of the dreams and into  reality. Well you can baicly figure out what happens next. If you love  slasher movies and want to see half nude women this is them movie for you.",964051200,2,1046,4.2272727272727275
7899480,3,6305976392,"I have to admit when I first saw this movie back in high school I hated it, but it grew on me after repeated viewings and have to say it's now one of my favorites. The cast is fun, the gore is ultra gooey and thought the  story doesn't adhere much to reality, it does lend itself to being warped  along the lines of Dr. Caligari... is this all real, or just Courtney's  illusion? I also enjoyed it being a true sequel, picking up with the same  characters from Part 1.  It's cheesy, but fun and even has a couple good  thrills throughout.",963964800,,538,4.174757281553398
