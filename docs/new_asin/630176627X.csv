355139,5,630176627X,"This is the most compelling drama series I have ever seen.  When China Beach was aired In 1988, I was only 19 years old.  At that age, only men impressed me and CHINA BEACH.  I just heard from the History Channel April 29, 2004 that the rights to show China Beach have expired to Warner Brothers.  I hope they release the series out on video.  I will definately buy the whole series lot if they release it.",1084233600,15,406,4.220779220779221
355140,5,630176627X,"My apologies for writing a second review of this classic tape, but I just wanted to add a couple of things...
Firstly, for those who might have surfed in vain, the Five and Dime, the 510th Evacuation Hospital, never actually existed. There was a US military facility at China Beach, but it was an R & R facility, having no surgical units, unlike Cam Ranh Bay, for example, which did have the 12th USAF Hospital, until 1972. To be correct, I think it became the 483rd in 1969, but it seems to have been referred to as the 483rd/12th USAF Hospital until its departure in 1972.
China Beach is based partly on the late Lynda Van Devanter's book, Home Before Morning: The Story Of An Army Nurse In Vietnam (available through Amazon.com) and is something of a composite of a number of different people's experiences.
Some female Vets have reservations about the series, and I totally respect them. Those brave women were actually there, and at some risk to their own lives. The 6th CC at Cam Ranh Bay was attacked by VC sappers in 1969 and about 20 buildings were destroyed, in one of which, two Army Nurses were only saved by a faulty fuse on the satchel charge that was thrown through their window. The Enemy's 'legitimate target' list included the chapel and the nurses' hooches. Geneva what?
Flaws or not, China Beach is a wonderful tribute to the courageous men and women who took care of the wounded from a largely conscript Army, whose average age was 19 (in WW II it was 26).
While they may not always have been treated as Vets, the Army, Air Force and Navy nurses who served in Vietnam are legally recognized as Veterans, having been part of the military, although some combat vets seem reluctant to recognize them as 'real vets'. Maybe they should watch China Beach.
As a footnote, the American Red Cross women (who appear in some China Beach episodes), including the SRAO field personnel (the Donut Dollies), who often took considerable risks, flying out to Fire Bases and Landing Zones all over VN, are not recognized as Veterans by the Government, by virtue of their 'civilian' status. Even though many of them still suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
Maybe the Government should watch China Beach, too.
All of the women who served in Vietnam are Veterans. For those who went out with the USO, like the wonderful Martha Raye and Connie Stevens, there should also be an Honorary Veteran category. Ooops, just thinking aloud...",1077321600,14,2441,4.705607476635514
355141,5,630176627X,"I had the opportunity to watch this TV show when it first aired in the late 80's and early 90's, but recently also on History Television.  I don't usually do this, but I watched repeats of this show again and again.  I have been so moved by the characters portrayed by these brilliant actors, who gave such heart-felt and moving performances, and it gave me huge insight into a war to which I had always been emotionally drawn.  I am a child of the 60's, a woman, remember the American war in Vietnam being televised on the evening news, was always particularly affected by it.  I was 12 and 13 when I first really became aware.  I am Canadian.  Each evening when I watched the news, I felt as though a part of my soul was torn out. Later I related to all the vets who weren't recognized when they returned after the war.  I have since watched many films and read books about both sides of the Vietnam conflict.  I wish more people would do this, because it would give great insight into all the new conflicts and political implications surrounding the current Middle Eastern/American involvements. The political history alone is spell-binding!  This television series captured the experiences of nurses, doctors, soldiers, prostitutes, medics and donut dollies, amongst many others...all fully realized characters, fascinating, funny, sad, haunted, living, dying.  The performances given by Dana Delany, Marg Helgenberger, Jeff Kober, Brian Wimmer, Richard Picardo, and so many others were so memorable as to be haunting.  It wasn't pretty.  It hurt. It felt really real, right to the very end of the last minute of the last episode.  I occasionally use a little Chantilly perfume, and it always reminds me of a dying soldier telling McMurphy(Dana Delaney) how sweet she smelled.  Her holding his hand meant everything to this very young boy who had been torn apart by war. I related to how much pain she felt and couldn't acknowlege after she returned to the States...her restlessness, her drinking, her searching for answers.
I have become aware that this series may soon become available on DVD.  I suppose in a world where ""Punk'd"" and many other inane shows are available almost immediately, we can hold out hope that this kind of quality TV will eventually be available for the original fans and the newly curious as well.
Again, this is a gem, write in to have it released, watch it, enjoy it and be touched by it, and thank you to all the wonderful actors, directors, producers, and contributors who brought so much life, realism, and emotional accessability to us all.
I am aware that some Vietnam vets have written in about this video, saying it wasn't realistic.  I think the continuing episodes tried to be as honest as they could be and truly helped a lot of people who didn't know about the truth connect with characters they could relate to, thereby bringing the full horror and experience closer to their hearts.  There are many excellent films, books, etc, available in order for the younger generation, who may not be aware, to educate themselves about this enormously important historical event.  Both sides' stories are eloquent. One of the earliest was ""The Deer Hunter"", in it's time very shocking.  Also, try some of Oliver Stone's films; obviously ""Platoon"" and ""The Fourth of July"", but also ""Heaven and Earth"", and many others.  Try ""The Killing Fields"" about the after-effects of the Vietnam war in Cambodia.  Try some of Tran Anh Hung's beautifully realized art films about post-war Vietman, ""The Vertical Ray of the Sun"", ""The Scent of Green Papayas"", and the more violent and desperate ""Cyclo"".
As well, try well-known writer Graham Greene's movie adaptation of ""The Quiet American"". The end of the movie contains an information trailer which illuminates the early involvement of America in the ""Indochine"" conflict. Talk about currently relevant news!
This TV series re-opened a whole world for me.  I have cried and been angry for every soul lost, on both sides, been moved by many lives.  I eagerly await the DVD release of the series; it has been the window to so much awareness, pain, and growth for me. If you would just like to see excellent television, with excellent performances, telling compelling stories, without having to get too involved...well, enjoy a great series...but I dare you to remain emotionally removed.",1075852800,17,4360,4.91008174386921
355142,5,630176627X,"... there would be no declining Neilson ratings. The late '80's produced several great quality drama shows, and ""China Beach"" was certainly among the top three. A show that respected both the viewer and men and women in uniform, it was a show that became better and better with each season. There are very few actors or actresses who have created characters as enduring and memorable in impact as Dana Delany did with Colleen McMurphy. An exceptional cast that had a lot of chemistry together that made the show all the more powerful.... Great casting, great writing, great acting, great production.
I used to tape the shows and watch them. Sorry the only one I have kept was the 2-hour finale that was shown in July 1991. ""China Beach"" had an incredible beginning as seen in this VHS tape and an incredible ending. The finale finds all the members of the five and dime unit coming back together for a reunion years after the war is over and they have returned to the States. The final scene with Colleen McMurphy at the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, D.C. with her daughter brought tears and emotions to my eyes like no other television show I had seen.
I would definitely be a candidate to buy the complete episode boxed set of this show in DVD format if it is ever released.",1056758400,82,1278,4.585152838427947
355143,5,630176627X,I shouldn't have watched this one! For some reason I missed this series and didn't even know much about it. Where I was and what I was doing is beside the point. This was a viewing I went into without baggage. By the end I was hooked! I want to see the rest of the episodes. The acting was excellent. The humor and pathos was in much better balance than in the popular M.A.S.H. A sensitive subject was covered in a sensitive but yet human way. We do laugh sometimes and cry sometimes together when we are in life's crucibles. Dana Delaney and the cast won some hearts in this series---no doubt about it.,1016755200,5,603,4.298245614035087

355145,1,630176627X,This tape (and the whole series) is nothing but a bunch of Hollywood blather.  I spent a year hauling combat troops into battle.  Never once did I see soldiers in muscle t-shirts with sweat rags tied around their heads.  China Beach is more soap opera than reality.,998092800,4,265,4.595744680851064
355146,4,630176627X,"I am a TV fanatic.  I admit it.  I absolutely LOVE to sit down and watch great shows.  A lot of people sit around and groan about the poor quality of television, but I'm not one of them.  I can always find something that's watchable.  Even better, I can always find something that's both truthful and exceptional.
Today there are a number of television shows that exceed my expectations.  I'm still hooked on E.R., NYPD BLUE, ALLY McBEAL and FELICITY, not to mention newer gems like ONCE AND AGAIN, THE WEST WING and THAT's LIFE.  These are shows that are not only well-written and acted, but that contain warmth, reality and overwhelming humanity.  These are the types of shows that end up being my favorites.
I've always been a sucker for sentimental stuff, which explains my fondness for past faves THIRTYSOMETHING, MY SO-CALLED LIFE and PARTY OF 5.  And this certainly explains my fondness for what remains in my opinion one of the all-time greatest TV shows ever, CHINA BEACH.
Created by John Sacret-Young and set at a fictional Army base during the Vietnam War, CHINA BEACH featured an ensemble cast of oftentimes colorful characters who were serving various duties during the war.
Colleen McMurphy (the superb Dana Delaney) was the weary nurse who found herself deeply effected by the patients that passed through the beds in the hospital where she served with the witty but troubled Dr. Dick (Robert Picardo).  Laurette (""special guest star"" Chloe Webb) was a singer looking for her big break while entertaining the troops, and Boonie (Brian Wimmer) was the hunky lifeguard who romanced her. Cherry (Nan Woods) was the innocent and naive donut dolly who came to Vietnam to find her MIA brother Rick, and later formed a close bond with sultry K.C. (Marg Helgenberger, in her career-defining role), a rather industrious business woman who set up camp on base as a prostitute and later a hair salon owner.  Becker (Michael Boatman) was the distraught morgue attendee who'd seen his share of death but who always found a reason to go on.  The whole operation was overseen by the fiery and indepedent Lyla (Concetta Tomei).
The cast was uniformly excellent, with stand-out (and Emmy winning) performances from Delaney and Helgenberger.  The show was critically lauded, but unfortunately floundered in later seasons, despite episodes that were deeply touching and well-written.
A good number of the episodes, including the pilot, were directed with an even hand by Mimi Leder (later of DEEP IMPACT and PEACEMAKER fame), who never shied away from the violence of the war while tugging on the heart strings.
Many referred to CHINA BEACH as a ""chick show,"" but those who did missed the point: that the Vietnam War was a point in history that effected everyone who was involved, regardless of their gender.
The pilot, the only episode available on video, introduces the characters and the basic set-up of the show.  There are plenty of explosions and screaming, bloodied patients, but at the heart of this brilliant show was a sincere and frequently haunting look at the tragedy that was the Vietnam War.  By focusing on the personal stories of its well-rounded and three-dimensional characters, the show brought the war into our homes and into our hearts in ways that many of the more male-oriented movies like PLATOON and HAMBURGER HILL weren't able to.
I've been sending Columbia House Video emails for years asking them to offer CHINA BEACH, but to no avail.  If they ever do, you can be sure that I will own the entire collection.  As it stands, I have the stellar two-hour pilot episode to remind me of this stand-out series, and also that there will ALWAYS be quality television, no matter what the nay-sayers say.

355147,5,630176627X,"If for nothing else, the stunning actress Dany Delany is worth watching in this film, but there is so much more to it. As a Vietnam War era veteran, I find films about the military are sometimes cliche filled or not do not  capture the reality of those of us who served. One thing common among  people caught up in desperate circumstances is the camaraderie felt by the  participants during a crisis. A closeness for people who were mere  strangers a very short time before, and perhaps would be again soon if they  survived. I knew this closeness when I was overseas and I felt it again  watching China Beach, watching them interact, the war a real thing for the  combatants, a vivid reminder of the fragility of life for the medics trying  to save as many blown up and broken bodies as they could. Even the  ""undetaker"" was not forgotten in the ensuing series, the man who  had to prepare the dead for shipment home while knowing he could become the  next body on the table if luck was not with him. To do proper justice to  this pilot film, the entire series should be made available online because  this is only a taste of the delicacy still ahead.",943056000,39,1152,4.428571428571429

355228,5,630176627X,"I have never seen a show like this, and know that I never will.  In times of war, women are often forgotten; the invisible support pushed out of the limelight by the action-packed experience of combat soldiers.  China Beach tried to change that.  It portrayed women in various different capacities during the Vietnam war.  Nurses, prostitutes, Red Cross workers, enlisted women, officers, reporters, performers...  China Beach gave them faces, histories, futures, pain, and joy.  The show had an arc; it showed what happened to non-combatants both in country and back in the world after their tours.  Women are often forgotten, but China BEach made that impossible.  Go to the Women's monument at the Wall in DC and try not to superimpose the face of Dana Delaney onto any of those nurses.

I'm not going to preach, but this show needs to be on DVD.  Right now.  Honor the vets with their story told from every point of view.  I can buy every episode of ""Masters of the Universe"" but not China Beach?  This show won four Emmys and was nominated for many more.  The show is marketable: Tour of Duty sells like hotcakes, as does Platoon and other Vietnam movies, Marg Helgenberger is hotter than hot with CSI, and the production team is well-known for making quality programming.
