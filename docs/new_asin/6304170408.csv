810470,5,6304170408,"I have seen few documentaries on a par with this one.  All of the big names in the computer industry appear on camera and those of us in the industry find it just this side of hilarious to see the obvious dislike between Gates and Jobs.  It's worth it just for that.  Don't forget to watch the sequel ""Nerds 2.0.1""",971308800,,314,4.2
810471,5,6304170408,"And we have THEM to thank for all of this.
Your humble author can't help but wonder how Bob Cringely got the likes of Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Steve  Wozniak, Paul Allen and others in front of the cameras for an honest look  inside the slightly twisted minds that begat the personal computer.
At 3  hours in length, ""Triumph of the Nerds"" isn't just a PBS  miniseries. On home video, it becomes an epic. And why shouldn't it be? The  personal computer has an impact on our lives equal to that of the light  bulb and the automobile. But in the case of the PC, most of the people  responsible for its creation and worldwide influence are still alive. These  are flesh and blood humans, not fading historical sketches like Henry Ford  and Thomas Edison.
""Triumph of the Nerds"" was originally  produced as a 20-year retrospective on the personal computer. But the PC  will be 25 years old in the year 2000. I can't wait to see Bob Cringely's  follow up.",969321600,45,948,4.47953216374269

Forgotten somewhat was the synergy that was required for both Apple and Microsoft to make the MAC a success.  Just as Viscalc (SP?) was required to make the Apple II the success it was, Microsoft Word for the MAC was essential for text files and the desk top publishing industry that followed it.  Yes, Billy was a pirate, but they needed each other.  BTW: I still own and use an upgraded to the plus + level my original 128K MAC.  Payroll and CAD!",1386460800,,651,4.330578512396694

It is a terrific three-part video history of the computer industry. More than a pedestrian history of the industry, this compelling program contains animated segments, promotional clips, archival footage, and intriguingly honest interview with wealthy industry nerds. With computers such a pervasive presence in society, this fascinating set holds wide appeal even for computer illiterates.

It is definitely one of the best technical documentaries ever made.",1374883200,,698,5.453703703703703

The most interesting aspect of watching this today is that it was made just prior to the boom of the Internet. The Internet was in existence, but it was realitively unknown by most people. Windows 95 had not yet been released, and you can watch Steve Ballmer show his excitement for what would turn out to be a huge game changer. You will see the rise and fall of IBM, Apple, and CP/M. The story of IBM and their quest for an O/S to go with a quickly created PC is probably the most memorable thing in the video.

Robert Cringley has access to many of the great geniuses and visionaries of Silicon Valley, he is knowledgeable and able to ask the right questions.

810686,5,6304170408,"What a fantastic series. I remember watching this on television years ago, and I don't think there has since been a documentary on the computing business to match it. Robert Cringely is now a regular on any show or documentary about either Bill Gates, or Steve Jobs and with good reason - he sums up the history of either with true knowledge gained from time spent with the two titans of the industry.

In this amazing series, he goes back to give credit where it is dues to companies such as MITS - who invented the first home computer in the shape of the ALTAIR.

For any would be entrepreneur, this series also gives the low down on how the big deals were made in Silicon valley, and a view of the hard work that made them happen.

All the biggies are interviewed here - Gates, Allen, Jobs, Woz, etc.  Cringley is very entertaining.

I am not disappointed with the DVD since it has been such a long time since I saw the original PBS version.

That's not the case. The VHS version and DVD version are identical as far as I can tell, almost certainly both cut from the same master. The VHS version omits all of the same segments listed in F. McSwiggan's review. The only 100% complete version of this show was the original PBS TV broadcast. There's no point in going out of your way to track down the VHS version on eBay... unless you don't own a DVD player or someone is selling a homemade VHS copy of the original broadcast.

All that aside, it's not as if the edited versions are butchered beyond recognition. They aren't missing that much content, relative to the big picture. They're still completely worthwhile. I say this as someone who saw the original broadcast and then bought both the VHS and DVD when they were released, and was initially disappointed to find that bits were missing. I soon got over it.

I purchased this DVD a year ago right here from Amazon.com because I remembered how excellent the program was when I watched it on PBS in 1996. I teach various technology and computer programming courses at the High School level and I thought this would be a good instructional aid in teaching students about the start of the personal computer industry. To further assist the teacher, Ambrose Video provides a good lesson plan outline (on their website) on how to approach the three parts contained within the DVD.

Overall, most students found the material presented in this video relevant and interesting. The only thing I would be cautious with is a scene in Volume 1, the ""HOT TUB"" scene. The majority of students were disturbed with it and I wouldn't have minded it if this was one of the scenes Ambrose chose to delete.",1219795200,4,941,4.7317073170731705
810794,5,6304170408,"Triumph of the Nerds (which is came from the book: Accidental Empires) is an eye opening documentary of the personal computer revolution and the  who made it happen from an inside writer who knew the individuals.

Robert Cringley does an exceptionally thorough job of providing a bird's eye view of the personalities, motivations, business environment and savvy of the nerds who changed the world.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading the entire book.  One of the parts that sticks out in my mind is about how the personal computer revolution happened so quickly.  Cringley points out that the personal computer industry was totally different than any other industry.  The participants shared their friendships, work, and knowledge freely.  This ""free sharing of knowledge"" was on of the primary the lynch pin that allowed the industry to explode so quickly.

They shared this knowledge because it all started out as a hobby and many hobbyists freely share ideas.  The nerds had no idea of the powder keg of an industry they were sitting on!

Cringley points out a second lynch pin was the growth of the industry was partially because of the youth and exuberance of its participants.  For example, he states: ""In the PC business, constant change is the only norm, and adolescent energy is the source of that change.""

This is an incredible show for anyone interested in learning about the fascinating story of the start of the PC industry.

The interviews with the top CEO's and founders of some of our greatest companies is an interesting insight into the growth of a modern industry. It is also interesting to see how luck played a role, as well as pirating.

The viewer will surely come to understand that we are just now in the infancy of computing and that the future is very bright and vast. Investors will also notice this fact and they will observe the market trends to decide where to invest their money to capture future growth.

 I especially enjoyed the interviews and comments by Steve Wozniak. He contributed some of the most incisive work that allowed computers to come to our desktops. He is a very unassuming man who simply enjoyed his hobby and I got the feeling that he still does.

 It makes you appreciate the strangers that you see everyday while sitting in a restaurant or driving down the road. Who amongst these strangers are the next Steve Wozniak, or Michael Gates? You come to understand that anyone you see can be a person who contributes the next advancement to mankind and gives one an appreciation of our fellow man.

Over three chaptors, Robert Cringely explains (with authority) how Apple made computing easy, how IBM made computing corporate, and how Microsoft made money from both these companies.

Although an entertaining and attention-holding series of documentaries, you will need to put yourself 'back in time' to really appreciate it.  This is not a documentary that timelines the development of the personal computer.  Instead, as is clearly stated by the title, this DVD shows us how a bunch of young nerds rose up to become major players in the industry.  If you're looking for insights from the people themselves, including big-players like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, then watch this.  If you're looking for something that explains how people felt when the CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, internet and mobile computing were released, then this show isn't for you.

What it needs is a fourth edition of the series.  At the end of the third part, Bob Cringely says he'll see us in ten years, and if only we could have another edition that covers this time period.  While the third documentary covers the release of Windows 95 (the period of time when this show was produced), it would do well with another edition covering Windows 98, XP and Vista, the return by Steve Jobs to Apple, a progress on Larry Ellison, and how the Internet has changed software development.

However his insider status and familiarity with the protagionsists allowed him to write a book called Accidential Empires. I recommend this book, it literally changed my life and gave me a framework of knowledge that has stood me in good stead as a consultant to the technology industry for the past decade or so.

In the book he calls Gates mean and Jobs a sociopath; neither sued.

The DVD was a PBS made documentary that was originally shown in the UK about nine years ago. It is compelling stuff and highly influential on how things are pannig out now. The DVD was supposed to be a TV adaption of the book, however I think that it is complementary.

Both Jobs and Gates agreed to be filmed for the DVD which again is amazing and Cringely is a kind of Louis Thoreaux for geek culture. It rocks, nuff said.

Remember that the Sixties happened in the early Seventies, right, so you have to remember that and that's sort of when I came of age. So I saw a lot of this and to me the spark of that was that there was something beyond sort of what you see every day. It's the same thing that causes people to want to be poets instead of bankers.

As the director of this video says, The Woz has a wonderful sense of humor. I found that out when I asked him for permission to use him as a character in my novel THE TOONIES INVADE SILICON VALLEY.  So cool of him, and as a result my book is unique among books.

It is dated somewhat, especially at the end with the forecasts about the future growth of the internet and what it would mean to PC and Mac development and the world. Nothing was truer then than remains today, predicting the long-term future of the computer and internet industry is simply impossible.

What troubles me with this edition by Ambrose is that they have apparently sacrificed bits and pieces here and there for some unfathomable reason. The main points are all still there, but some of the side stories and flavors have been cut. Examples include Steve Wozniak's description of his early interest in electronics in finding an old AT&T phone company manual to learn to hack into the phone system to call the Pope. It cuts Steve Jobs' description of his early experiences with Bill Gates, saying that the original version of Word was ""just terrible but they kept at it..."", and someone whose name I can't remember describing the early mainframes and trying to use one as ""you were lucky if your entire city had one mainframe, and, if your company had it, there would only be one.""  These are the ones I noticed right off, I'm sure there are others and they are minor things, but it's troubling that a company buys the rights to a show and edits it for whatever reason rather than simply giving us the whole deal.",1098921600,130,1574,4.72
