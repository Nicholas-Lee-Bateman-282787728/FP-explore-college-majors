7845232,5,6303405495,"I'm really surprised that there aren't any reviews for such a cute video!  It tells the story of a dream that Charlie Horse had one night about a land of no numbers.  He is led around by the Numbers Lady (played by his creator, Shari Lewis), to convince King Zero (so wonderfully played by Darren, that it makes you wonder what happened to him and why he's not in show business (at least not that much)) to love numbers.  But, Charlie Horse finds out that it is not easy, and ends up in jail because of it.  There, he meets an old man (the one and only Captain Person from ""The Shari Show"" back in the 70's.  I was pleasantly surprised to see him on here!!).  He finally gets out, and gets the kids, and the king to love numbers.  Then, we have more fun with numbers with Shari, Talia (one of the little girls in the show), and Darren.  It ends with the three and Lamb Chop celebrating Lamb Chop's 35th anniversary (at that time).  Wonderful video with wonderful songs and actors.",1313452800,,980,4.311475409836065
