1103190,5,6306012400,This Movie is just wonderful. I saw it when it came out and I can't wait to get the DVD or Video to it. You will see what I mean when you get your DVD or Video.,964051200,,160,3.3513513513513513
1103191,5,6306012400,"I know this is going to be a wonderful video. The movie was a sweet, romantic telling of love lost and suddenly found again. David Duchovny is amazingly perfect in the role of Bob Rueland. He makes you want to see what  happens next. You cry with him, you laugh with him... you feel what he is  going through.
Minnie Driver is a good choice for Gracie. She seems to  work well with Duchovny and especially with Bonnie Hunt.
If you want a  movie that you can watch with your kids, this is it. I took my nephew and  my mother and they both loved it. I'm definitely going to add this to my  DVD/Video collection and I'm looking forward to Bonnie Hunt's next venture.",964051200,4,663,4.264

1104631,5,6306012400,"I have viewed ""Return to Me"" many times because it is a film with HEART - no pun intended.  The two stars David Duchovny and Minnie Driver give greatly sensitive jobs, he with his delivery of lines and his final breakdown after his wife's death, and in a restaurant scene with a date from hell; she with her labored breathing as a patient awaiting a heart for a transplant, and as the waitress in the same restaurant scene.  All other performances are, also, first rate.  Carroll O'Connor in this his final film uses an Irish accent to great affect, and is a worry-wort as a caring Grandfather who ends up with only a granddaughter heart-transplant patient.  Robert Loggia, always a terrific actor, was never better nor more endearing.  His laughter in one card-playing scene where he names all the Italian (most Italian-American) singers and Italian composers is very infectious as he laughs from deep down in the diaphragm.  His buddies are forced to laugh with him - it is just too good a moment.  One of my favorite supporters is Bonnie Hunt.  She co-wrote the screenplay, directed the film and is aces as an actress of non-anticipation.  Her scenes with another great supporter of this film who plays her husband, James Belushi, are terrific and funny.  (Only one odd moment:  When they're bowling and, perhaps the best line deliverer in the film, Marianne Muellerleile, makes a responsive gesture to Bob's bowling dedication to Grace - looked anticipated by Ms. Hunt, who is probably prettier and lovelier than she may believe she is.)  Co-writer, Don Lake, adds a hysterical character portrayal of Ralph in one scene of the film.  The supporting actors playing Wally and Emmett both give highly nuanced performances, as does mellifluence voiced Brian Howe as Mike.  I found it a bit odd how David Duchovny did not relate well to Brian's character, however.  Brian did beautifully in the scene that was shot 20 times but ended up using the first take.  It almost seems as though Duchovny is intimidated by Howe for some reason.  You be the judge!  I have seen the film over 35 times.  It feels like a comfortable old shoe.  The screen family becomes my own every time I see it.  It is a feel good movie which is well-written, well-directed, well-cast and well-acted.  I don't want to leave out the performances of several actors.  Here goes:  David Alan Grier as Charles Johnson and friend of Bob's is right-on terrific.  Dick Cusack as Mr. Bennington is quite good.  Holly Wortell as Marsha, the date from hell, is so good, that I keep watching that scene again & again to watch the hysterical ensemble acting, though, the camera is seldom off of her, the instigator.  Joey Gian is perfect as the singer.  He wrote two songs for the film and sings them and 2 standards including the title song.  Now, to Joely Richardson:  I believe that her short role needed to steep more time with D. Duchovny in order to seem more organic.  She did well, but it didn't flow in the same way as all other integral supporting players seemed to come off more familiar with one another.  I do not blame her ability as an actress, I blame the situation which probably didn't afford her the opportunity to be on the set relating with Bob, more (& Charlie).  One of my favorites lines at the beginning is when she tells Bob in his tux, ""You look so cute!""  And he responds, ""You spend all day with an ape, what do you expect!""  The child who played Tyler did a great job.  Also, Patrick Hunt who played Danny.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a serious subject/feel good film.",1463184000,5,3586,4.643879173290938

 David Duchovny actually plays a non damaged/slease-bag for a change.

1105483,3,6306012400,"Romance with an unusual plot device: the female lead is dying from heart disease until she receives a heart transplant from a widower's wife who was killed in a tragic accident. A year later, the two leads meet and are immediately attracted to one another.

In the standard plot of a romance, boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl for a problem which is occasionally genuine but more often terribly contrived by the writer, but, in the end, the obstacle is resolved and the couple get together. The success of this standard plot depends on several things: how believable the mutual attraction is in the first place, how much we like them as individuals and as a couple, how genuine the obstacles are which separate them again, and how  convincing, or at least how clever, the resolution is. This romance fails on almost all points. The leads are dull and depressing, their instant attraction abrupt and inexplicable, the romance is awkwardly written, the obstacle separating them is contrived, and the resolution unconvincing. Maybe this kind of material could have been redeemed in the hands of Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Nora Ephron and Rob Reiner. But the writing, the direction, and the lead actors, of this romance aren't good enough.

Supporting actors, Bonnie Hunt, who also co-wrote and directed, and Jim Belushi, as her husband, fare a little bit better than the leads, but, the performance of two old pros, Carroll O'Conner and Robert Loggia, stand-out. As the girl's Irish grandfather and his Italian brother-in-law, they run an Irish-Italian tavern. In contrast to the limp central romance, their scenes with the tavern regulars resonate with genuine affection and warmth. And when O'Conner is on screen having a heart-to-heart talk with his granddaughter, or with her boyfriend, the movie, briefly, shines. Unfortunately, those memorable moments are too short, and barely elevate this movie to ""OK.""",1433289600,,1914,5.06984126984127

1105583,5,6306012400,"This was a jewel of a film.  The story line was inventive and intriguing.  I was, at first, reluctant to view this film, having heard it described as a ""Chick flick"", and, indeed, it had substantial emotional content.  However, it was evident from the start that this was not in the ""Lifetime"" ""movie-of-the-week"" style.  Bonny Hunt's touch in writing and directing (and acting!) was deft and delicate.  The humor, irony and pathos inherent to the plot were fully explored and fully depicted without once devolving into mawkishness or banality.  The entire ensemble each gave finely etched performances.  I was especially taken by that of David Alan Grier, whom I had previously enjoyed as a comedian and comedic actor (""In Living Color"").  He gave a wonderfully in-depth, three-dimensional performance that was an essential part of this film.  Also, what can I say about Carroll O'Connor and Robert Loggia - two masterful actors who filled their roles perfectly, without ever attempting to intrude their ""star power"" further into this film than their roles required. James Belushi and Bonnie Hunt, as husband-and-wife and friends of Minnie Driver's Grace, worked wonderfully together.  Their interplay reminded me somewhat of my own parents.  And, of course, David Duchovny and Minnie Driver, playing two star-crossed lovers, no less than Romeo and Juliet, were simply delightful together.  I have a special thank-you for Joely Richardson's brilliant, if brief, portrayal of Elizabeth, Bob Rueland's (Duchovny's character) wife.  Although Elizabeth was killed early in the film, she may have been the most important character in the piece.  Her scenes in the first part of the film were essential to the development of Duchovny's character and indeed to the character of the film itself.  To me it felt as though the ghost of Elizabeth hovered over and floated through just about every scene of this film following her death.  Elizabeth's palpable presence was the motivation driving many of the subsequent scenes in this film.  All in all, a beautiful interweaving of plot and character interplay that yielded an absolute jewel of a film.",1430265600,3,2140,5.2105263157894735

Starts with a view of a couple who are deeply in love, contrasted with a young woman battling for survival in an intensive care ward.

Probably the silliest part of the movie is at the beginning where the protagonist is dancing with his wife and it skips ahead to her dying at the hospital. The whole impact of the scene is compromised because it never explains what happened to his wife so I'm left to assume she died dancing with him because he must be THAT bad.

1105723,5,6306012400,"Add Olive to the ranks of labels licensing titles from MGM, which is only a good thing for movie buffs hungering for vintage films on Blu-Ray. Old-fashioned, warm and thoroughly charming, Bonnie Hunts one-and-only directorial feature, RETURN TO ME, ought to make for an ideal Valentines Day viewing.

David Duchovny  looking quite relaxed away from the constrains of The X-Files  stars as a Chicago architect whose wife (Joely Richardson) dies in a car accident. Her heart ends up being transplanted in the body of Grace (Minnie Driver), a waitress at her Irish grandfathers Italian restaurant. The two coincidentally meet, and instantly generate an attraction for one another, although Graces reluctance to talk about her surgery provides the eventual dramatic conflict that comes between them.

From reading that plot description  and really the movie is as direct as it sounds  Return to Me comes across like any generic Hallmark movie or  even worse  the forgettable Christian Slater-Marisa Tomei flick Untamed Heart. What separates it from other genre ventures is Hunts development of the story and its supporting players, filled by the likes of Carroll OConnor (in his final film) as Graces grandfather, Robert Loggia as his brother-in-law and resident chef, Hunt herself as Graces friend and Jim Belushi as her husband. Hunt and Don Lakes script hits exactly the right note in letting all of these characters have their moment, adding not just humanity but gentle, realistic humor into the story as well. Its a truly delightful film, one that makes you disappointed Hunt never directed another picture.

Shot on-location by Laszlo Kovacs, Return to Me makes for an attractive Blu-Ray from Olive. The 1080p (1.85) transfer has nice detail and warm colors, and the 5.1 DTS MA soundtrack is fine, offering a pleasant array of oldies and Nicholas Pikes low-key score. Extras brought over from the DVD include a commentary by Lake and Hunt, a music video and one deleted scene culled from a workprint.",1425427200,2,2003,5.138461538461539

1106012,5,6306012400,"If you haven't seen this movie, it's just a truly fun and heartwarming one to see over and over again, especially if you have a romantic side, and have an appreciation for music from some of the favorite Italian singers like Dean Martin & Tony Bennet. Acting is great, and a good story line. We love it! Plus the bantering between the old Italian guys is great!",1416355200,,361,4.402985074626866

1106014,5,6306012400,Love this movie. I don't understaffed why so many great movies never get any attention.,1415836800,,87,4.866666666666666

1106016,5,6306012400,"This movie is really just a fun, romantic comedy. If you're from the Chicago area, the sites and sounds of the city are pretty spot on. The story has everything--tragedy, comedy, kids, dogs, gorillas, music! While this is not a deeply provocative ""artistic"" film, it tells an interesting story in a way that is so Bonnie Hunt. I love the cast...Minnie Driver and David Duchovny don't overdo the romance. Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi are SO Chicago and provide the comic relief. An Carroll O'Connor and the ""guys"" remind me of my own Chicago uncles--now gone. But if you're a high-brow, forget it. You will probably find this film too simple and not deep enough. As for me, it's one of my old friends that I watch whenever I need a feel-good movie. It's in my Prime video collection and downloaded on my Fire HDX. It's like an old friend or milk and cookies before bedtime!",1415404800,2,871,4.589743589743589

1106020,4,6306012400,"Nice story,  great cast, everything looks good and I liked the movie. The only problem I have with it is that it ends short, it seems like there should be another 15 minutes or so more to finish the story! For it being a love story the 2 principals actually spend very little screen time together. Good chemistry between David Ducovney and Minnie Driver. I wanted more. But it's not to be. I'd say it's well worth a watch!",1414540800,,422,4.341772151898734

1106117,5,6306012400,"Charming movie and surprisingly very PG13...one instance of a cleavage and a couple of funny bad words but you hardly notice them.  Good messages for kids: intergenerational socialization, respect of the elderly, take-it-slowly dating, honesty, patience, friendship...and a scene stealing dog and gorilla to boot!  For grown ups, its a really fun movie too.  I like edgy, artsy, in your face movies yet this is so enchanting that I keep watching it over and over.  Helen Hunt has the best sense of humor in both acting and directing.",1411344000,,533,5.0227272727272725

The cast is a perfect combination of endearing characters, and the story so engaging from heartbreak to hilarity, from desperation to full joy! I adore the four best buddies always arguing over their favorite singers and baseball players, and their faithful mother-hen among them....my dad would have gotten such a kick out of them! I love the friends (Bonnie Hunt and Jim Beluchi are perfect, and Jim is hilarious!) I love the lead actors...David Duchovny and Minnie Driver, who both do a great job of portraying pain/loneliness/fear and growing hope/courage and understanding. The storywriters, actors, director, editors, etc. did a great job of bringing in so many touching and delightful moments. I love the music selections, the relationships (including 'Sammy Sosa' and the blind date), and the story's depth & height of emotions. Return To Me is an encouraging heart-warmer that always leaves us feeling very uplifted!",1399766400,,992,5.245283018867925
1106688,4,6306012400,"David Duchovny, Minnie Driver, Carroll O'Connor, Robert Loggia, Joely Richardson, Bonnie Hunt (doubling as director) and James Belushi are among the excellent cast in this unexpectedly stirring romantic comedy set in Chicago. Unlike many Chicago-based films, this one is actually filmed there, and makes great use of locations like the Lincoln Park Zoo that anyone familiar with the city will recognize. There is a music video, deleted scene, and director's commentary (but no trailer) in the special features on this DVD from MGM. The death and heart transplant subplot proves more mystical than cornball, lending a spiritual air to a film already tinged with Irish and Italian Catholic imagery. Duchovny and Driver aren't the strongest romantic leads in film history, but their romantic chemistry is sweet and realistic. The scenes of family life and dating have a realistic feeling that makes it feel like you're watching real Chicagoans here. The only drawback to the film is that its plot is a bit boilerplate, being a very pleasant viewing experience without being terribly original or memorable. For the heartfelt performances and authentic Chicago flavor, I strongly recommend it.",1399593600,2,1188,5.358288770053476

The storyline is real, having worked in television news and the assignment to edit a five part series on organ donation. Folks, it
is real, the stories I listened to were overwhelming in hearing people speak of the system and especially the familys who gave permission to donate their loved one's organs to save another person.

It's a very sweet tale directed by the ever-funny Bonnie Hunt, who also stars in the film as leading man David Duchovny's best friend's wife.

Carroll O'Connor plays Driver's widowed father, an Irishman who, along with his Italian brother-in-law (Robert Loggia), owns an Irish and Italian restaurant where Grace waits tables and where she meets Bob (Duchovny).

There's plenty of humor provided by Hunt. O'Connor (with an Irish lilt), and Jim Belushi, who plays her husband, and pathos as well. It's the perfect feel-good rom-com that you can watch many times over.",1386806400,,797,4.984962406015038

David (D) is good in the movie as was Mini (though I think she was 'under utilized'). The person that selected the wardrobe (for all participants, except the dog) should be executed 'post haste'. Terrible choices for clothing. Anyway, here you have a great cast, a plausible storyline and yet it fell so short of where it could have taken us. Kinda like a third grader doing the directing. I've seen both lead actors do such better in bringing their lead characters to life and this was not their best effort.

1107321,5,6306012400,"Return to Me (Bonnie Hunt, 2000)
[originally posted 10Apr2000]

Another thoroughly excellent movie. This has been a good movie year so far, or else I've just gotten really, really lucky with my choices. Bonnie Hunt wrote, produced, directed, and played a supporting role in this fifties movie translated with a nineties sensibility.

Bob Rueland (Kalifornia's David Duchovny) is a widower who meets, and immediately falls in love with, Grace Briggs (Good Will Hunting's Minnie Driver), his waitress while he's on a blind date with possibly the most obnoxious woman ever to grace a film screen (played to the hilt by Holly Wortell, last seen <surprise!> in The Bonnie Hunt Show). And yes, I do remember Sandra Bernhard's aborted (thankfully) film career when I say that.

Much of the movie's brilliance lies solidly in the fact that it IS a plot, and a pacing, straight out of the days when Jimmy Stewart and Mickey Rooney were playing romantic leads. It won't work if you really can't see Duchovny and Driver dating for so many months without jumping into bed, but both of them are quite capable of pulling it off, and they do with great style. Adding to the atmosphere is a wonderful ensemble cast, with Hunt and James Belushi as Diver's best friends, and Carroll O'Connor as her grandfather, half-owner (with Robert Loggia) of Chicago's only Irish-Italian restaurant.

It's wonderful. Go see it. Take female friends if you feel odd walking into a chick flick. **** ",1382918400,,1467,4.9471544715447155

Bonnie's face when she looks back at her friend with that ""I cant help myself I just LOVE this goober""  look, is priceless.  I know I am not alone in this feeling, because that scene is featured on Youtube so you can watch it by itself whenever you need a smile.  Belushis questionable parenting skills, lost love and new love, save the animals, crazy old people in a diner.  It's got a little of everything.

1107592,5,6306012400,"I highly recommend this movie for someone who wants a clean romantic comedy, with a twist on the old ""boy meets girl"" plotline.  David Duchovny's character we meet when he's still married, just before a terrible accident takes his wife from him, and leaves him a grumpy friend and boss.  Minnie Driver's character is a girl who's probably never dated much, other than the crazy character's her best friend sets her up with.  When Minnie and David meet, there's a spark right away.  Maybe it's her sense of humor (and a hint of revenge) when she trick's the girl David has just met on a blind date and is obviously annoying him to no end with her snobbish attitude and boring talk.  Or maybe his joke back when he catches Minnie pulling the prank.  But something starts, and through the movie, you enjoy watching these two fall in love, and don't really want it to end.  Of course, the plot is enjoyable, but so are all the actors, who seem at ease and natural in their rolls.  And besides that, there's the dialog.  This is one of the few modern movies (1990's or later) in which I never cringed at a line of dialog--it's all so good, believable, and smooth.  Anyway, it's a fun movie that you can enjoy on a date, or even with your family if you have kids, and not have to worry about fast-forwarding, covering eyes, or covering little ears.",1377475200,3,1342,4.463114754098361

Duchovny was totally lacking as a believable, romantic lead, and I failed to see his appeal beyond being a forgettable nice guy.  Driver seemed to lack the spark that made her so appealing in other movies like ""Grosse Pointe Blank"" and ""Good Will Hunting""; she just seemed to be going through the motions to put out another movie.  Overall, the characters lacked depth, were less than believable, and used the most obvious plot twists available for an unlikely story.  Based on the ratings, I'd say others will disagree with me, but overall, I felt a lack of connection or enjoyment while watching this film.  I'd recommend a pass.",1377043200,2,836,4.818181818181818

Anyone who knows, or has had Heart Surgery and knows the emotional conflicts arising from it will love this movie.  And, having lost friends and family members to early deaths due to accident with the donating of organs should watch this move as well.

Bob is happily married until his wife passes suddenly in a car accident. Grace needs a new heart, and receives a transplant. A year later, Bob & Grace's paths cross and they fall in love. Grace discovers that it's Bob's first wife's heart that she has now and tells Bob. Grace then leaves for Italy. Bob comes to terms with what's happened, follows Grace and HEA.

I enjoyed the acting. Jim Belushi nailed the Irish-Catholic dad character.

This is a well-written and well-produced romance. I loved Carroll O'Connor as the overprotective Grandfather. And his three friends, as additional family for Minnie Driver's Grace. It had a believable story, believable characters. I cried with Grace when she tells Bob about her heart transplant, and who's heart it was originally. I love how O'Conner's Marty tells Bob how maybe Elizabeth's heart was always meant to be with him.

1108054,5,6306012400,"This is one of my favorite movies. I've watched it many times. It's not a romantic comedy in spite of the efforts of the director to make all the supporting cast hilariously funny. Well, maybe we needed those light touches to elevate the sadness of the story. The first time I saw it, these slapstick moments annoyed me but, after that, I saw that they were necessary to the story. Why have enormously talented comic actors in the supporting cast if you aren't going to use them. It's a very sweet story, dragged out by her rather unreasoning fear of telling him that she has had a heart transplant.  Then she is forced to tell him and the story evolves.  But, who knows, maybe any of us who had someone else's heart beating inside them would be just as weird as she acts.  The showing of the Ape's reaction is touching and believable to me as animals know a lot more than we think they do. David Ducovney's part could have been played by any other nice young actor but he does a very good job. Minnie Driver's part could have been played by any nice young actress, preferably a prettier one, but she did a good job too. Bonnie Hunt is, as always, perfect. Even Jim Belushi is, also, perfect. I highly recommend this movie. Months Later: Have just looked at this movie for maybe the l0th time and now I can honestly say that everything about it is perfect. I have no idea why it wasn't a bigger hit when it came out but I think it is gaining fans every year. People who love a great story so beautifully told.

I want to know how Grace thinks about living with a heart taken from someone else, what her thoughts are when she discovers who it is, etc.  There should be a note not just of anguish, but of mystery -- a quiet sense of awe.

It is a treat to watch a movie where people recognize God's hand in our lives.

Some things are in poor taste.

There is excess baggage.  In particular, the big oaf who teaches profanity to his children by his example, contributes little of value to the film.  The same could be said of Charlie's floozies.

I wish that Bob's blind date, in the restaurant, was a nice  person, perhaps prettier than Grace.  Then we could watch Bob caught between the mysterious attraction of Grace and the merely natural attraction of his date.  Now THAT, well acted, could be very funny indeed.

Overall, I would have preferred a gentle approach to this charming story.  Less obvious, more nuanced.

And could we have subtitles in English?  Closed captioning isn't as nice, and it doesn't work for many people who use composite DVD output.

However, the supporting cast is the key to the movie.  Hunt and Belushi are great as a married couple with a bunch of kids.  What makes the movie both humorous and tender are the ""four old guys"" - led by Carrol O'Conner and Robert Loggia.  To be blunt - I want to be just like those ""four old guys"" in a decade of so.  They obviously enjoyed each other, and making the movie.  I have a very small collection of films.  I only pick those that are enjoyable, with humor and a positive twist.  When I am ill, or depressed, I pick out one from my collection for diversion and a little inspiration.  This superb little movie fits the bill.

1108150,5,6306012400,"Minnie Driver and David Duchovony give a wonderful performance in this film by Bonnie Hunt (who also acted in it).  Grace (Minnie) is a heart transplant patient while Bob (David) is an architect married to the beautiful Elizabeth (Joely Richards). After an evening out for a fundraiser for Elizabeth's employer, the zoo, they are in a terrible accident.  Subsequently Elizabeth dies.  In the same hospital, Grace finally receives her heart transplant.

The film skips to a year later where Bob is still grieving and Grace is learning to live for the first time as a healthy person, instead of perpetually sick.  Her friend Megan (Bonnie Hunt and her husband Joe (James Belushi) and their numerous kids are frequently seen with her and offer comic relief and advice.

She eventually meets Bob at her grandfather's restaurant O'Reilly's.  The two are a hit from the start and the film shows much of their time together.  Between her nerves about her surgery and his memories of his wife, it isn't easy, but they find a comfortable relationship with each other.  When they hit a rough patch, she journeys to Italy and Bob realizes just how special she is to him.

While its hard to go into great detail about this film without giving away how the story ends, I feel that it rates high with romantic comedies.

The music is fantastic as I am a big Dean Martin fan.  The main song is what probably inspired the name of the movie.  The other music selections are tasteful as well and fit the theme of the time period in which Dean Martin was popular.

I thought the roles were well cast and I've always been a fan of David Duchovony.  I was pleased to see the romantic side of him in this as he often plays more ""manly"" roles.

While some might say that the plot is predictable it is only that way during the movie.  Outside of watching it I would say that the idea behind it is highly original.  I don't want to give away too much but it explores the thought that we are all connected in some way.

This is one of my favorite movies.  It has the ability to make me laugh out loud and also tear up with joy.  I love the use of imagery in the film with beautiful flower arrangements and cityscapes.  It also makes a detour into Italy and I was not able to tell if it was a set or actual city which rates high for me as far as viewing goes.  In all, this is a movie that gives me the warm fuzzies.",1281657600,,2389,4.379545454545455

Happily, it hasn't!

The story tells of a likable Chicago construction foreman (David Duchovny), who loses his anthropologist/zoo curator wife (Joely Richardson) in a car accident, later falling in love with a waitress/artist (Minnie Driver), who, unbeknownst to him, had received his wife's heart in transplant surgery. While this scenario is, admittedly, farfetched, director/screenwriter/actress Hunt gives the story so much grace and gentle humor, and fills it with so many memorable characters, it's easy to fall in love with the film.

To a soundtrack heavy with Dean Martin tunes (including the title track), we meet their friends...David's 'circle' consists of his construction crew, Joely's assistant and his best friend (David Alan Grier), a somewhat clueless donor/patron (Dick Cusack, real-life father of John and Joan), a beautiful dog named Max, and a remarkable great ape named Sidney (portrayed by an actual gorilla, Kwan). Minnie's circle is fabulous; Carroll O'Connor (in his last film) is her Irish grandfather, with Robert Loggia, his Italian brother-in-law (and her uncle), who co-own 'O'Reilly's Italian Restaurant'(!); Eddie Jones, William Bronder, and Marianne Muellerleile are the rest of restaurant gang; and her best friends Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi (both very, very good!), and their brood of kids round out her circle. With a cast like this, how can you go wrong?

Filmed on location in Chicago and in Rome, Italy, this story of love lost and rediscovered never strikes a wrong chord, played out perfectly by Duchovny, Driver, and the remarkable cast. I actually hated to see the film end, I wanted to spend more time with everybody!

If you don't own this, do yourself a favor...it's very inexpensive, and MUCH better than 90% of the romantic comedies out, right now...please check it out, you'll thank me!",1278374400,4,2116,5.106936416184971

1108206,4,6306012400,"When I first watched Return To Me I was very scepticle about the film because it is a romance film, which is not my favorite genre of movies but I decided to give it a shot. When the credits started rolling I realized that this is one of my favorite romance movies ever.
David Duchovny (of who I am a big fan of) and Minnie Driver deliver very good acting. This film also has very good music.
Return To Me is a must see for romance movie fans and people who are scepticle towards romance movies.",1270944000,,495,4.166666666666667
1108207,4,6306012400,"Sure, it is pure schmaltz and it layers on that sentimental syrup like crazy, but for some reason this is one of those films that actually sells it.  No matter how thick it may get, it never makes you embarrassed to be sitting there, soaking it all in.

So go ahead and soak it all in.

Predictably heart-tugging, `Return to Me' opens pretty tragically.  While Grace is lying in wait for a heart transplant, Bob is suffering the loss of his darling wife in a car accident.  It just so happens that Bob's wife was an organ donor and her loss was Grace's gain, for she received a new heart.  By chance (or was it fate?) Bob runs into Grace and instantly finds himself smitten (who wouldn't be smitten by Minnie Driver?).  They may not have a lot in common, but something is there pushing them together.

We all know where this is going, but for some reason we are not offended by this.

I think the films success lies in the dedicated performances, for the script is a little to `by the books' to make much of an impact on its own.  David Duchovny and Minnie Driver are a beautiful pair, and they feed off every layer of one another wonderfully.  I never watched `The X-Files' and what I have seen from Duchovny has been mixed at best, so this is probably my favorite performance from him.  He plays to Bob's emotional distress flawlessly (that collapse when he gets home made me cry).  Minnie is just amazing in almost everything (I adore her) and this is no exception.  She has such a light in her that emulates every single texture in her character's aura.

The supporting cast is pretty great as well, from Carroll O'Connor hamming it up for attention to Bonnie Hunt (who also directed) and James Belushi providing a flawless comedic couple.

In the end I totally recommend this movie.  The script may be a little too predictable, but the acting and the sentiment work wonders for a film that could have easily been a forgettable mess.",1269475200,,1937,4.488571428571428

1108210,5,6306012400,"I am not much of a fan of romantic movies, but this is such a lovely masterpiece by Bonnie Hunt.  I have yet to find another movie that offers so much chemistry between the main characters with a terrific combination of comedy and romance, but without conflict where one of the main characters is not wholly deserving of the other lead character's affection.  This movie is such a rare find where both the main characters are so worthy of what lies ahead for them.  I have to admit that I am not much of a David Duchovny fan, but in my opinion, he plays the role of Bob meticulously and this is by far his best performance ever.  Throughout this movie, you feel his pain and his joy. I dare you to watch this movie and not be moved by the scene where he breaks down in front of his door with the dog.  I don't think this movie could have accomplished what it does without Minnie Driver and David Duchovny playing the lead roles.

Another great thing about this movie is that the side characters are as much a part of this movie as the main characters are.  Grace's family in this movie really creates the comedy relief and every time I watch this I am left wishing for relationships in my own life as fulfilling as you can sense Grace and her family have.

I long for more movies like this with such a heartfelt story line, and with simple conflict that is not about somebody intentionally marring the emotional well being of their counterpart.",1260748800,,1444,4.382022471910112

1108268,4,6306012400,"RETURN TO ME is soft, sweet romantic comedy staring David Duchovny and Minnie Driver.  This film, although very predictable, is charming and quite well done.  My sweetie and I spent a very pleasant Sunday afternoon relaxing together and enjoying this film.

In RETURN TO ME, Bob Rueland (David Duchovny) and his wife, Elizabeth (Joely Richardson), are very much in love.  They seem to have the perfect life.  Then tragedy strikes and Elizabeth is killed in a horrible car accident.  Bob is devastated; he is barely functioning.  After about a year, he meets Grace (Minnie Driver), and he feels an immediate connection to her.  Grace has her own secrets, however.  She has recently had a heart transplant, and for the first time in her life is not ""the sick one.""  She doesn't want to tell Bob about her transplant.  As things progress, Grace realizes that she must tell Bob about her medical past.  Unfortunately, it is almost too late, and Grace and Bob may both end up with broken hearts.

RETURN TO ME is wonderfully sentimental, very engaging, and very sweet, without being too syrupy.  I cried in the beginning, I cried at the end, and I smiled the entire way through.  It is just a plain nice movie.  Minnie Driver gives her typical excellent performance, and David Duchovny (who, as much as I love him, just can't act) does a fine job.  Bonnie Hunt, as both a first time director and as Grace's best friend, uses her signature humor and dry wit to great advantage, and Jim Belushi is great as her lovable oaf of a husband.  As wonderful as the entire cast is, however, Carroll O'Connor, as Grace's grandfather, and Robert Loggia, as his partner in an Irish-Italian restaurant, steal the show, bringing tears and laughter to your heart each time they are on the screen.  Wonderful old standards permeate this soundtrack, and you will find yourself quietly humming along.

1108326,5,6306012400,"My son brought his DVD collection home from his stint in the military and took this movie out to cheer me one day. I'm not enthusiastic about movies with a medical theme especially not dying patients (I was a nurse and my husband is a surgeon) but he assured me that it was uplifting and not too dark and dire.

Three cheers for Bonny Hunt. What a smash hit! I've always loved her acting style but here she does everything but run the catering truck. Music production, directing, and a zillion other things. There are about a half dozen Hunts in the credits so I'm assuming she has a terrific and talented family to fall back on.

The necessary drama involved with heart transplantation is handled with a light and spiritual hand. I loved the song played over the transposition of a deeply grieving husband and the transfer of his beloved wife's heart. Something about an angel and very beautifully scored.

Minnie Driver is aces especially playing along side Bonny Hunt. The two showed real family style confidence and love with a generous dose of witty humor. The stricken Driver is shown pale faced and drawn, gasping in a reserved and grave manner. The attentive Hunt jumps up from her bedside attendance to hear what poor Minnie has to say. Without opening her eyes she sighs, ""Rosebud"" and then smirks.

Healing is swift in the magic of movie time and Driver's portrayal of a twenty something gal having to deal with the final awakening of sexuality now that she's saved from her life of physical challenge is simply super. A very tasteful scene shows her opening her robe while staring into a mirror before her nightly shower with hope overshadowed by her deep fear of rejection. A normal young girl's wondering how she will be viewed by a future lover is dramatically increased by her slow start and a huge scar. A spirited embrace of all the goodies life has newly offered her however shows that her hope is well placed. But as a mother, my heart went out to the character for a struggle so well revealed.

Dave Duchovny is well cast here. I have never seen him in anything so his performance stood on singular merit. His flare for ironic and playful humor was balanced by an ability to rise above the very common role of grieving husband. Without melodrama, he portrays a man lost in space, condemned to drift among stars that can never be reached.

The writing is really first rate, again light and spiritual. The story is allowed to wander around in a varied and compelling landscape of a superb supporting cast. Carroll O'Connor hits all the high notes as the sturdy grandfather who has spent a life time of worry raising his orphaned sickly granddaughter. Religion is vary rarely handled with such style and sensitivity. As the miraculous and long awaited news arrives at his popular family restaurant (a clever multicultural quirk) that a heart has suddenly come available, his first instinct is to run to the chapel at the hospital to put in a good word with his favorite saint. He spends the long hours on his knees at the alter, confident that he is lifting his little Gracie up to the light on his reverent and patient shoulders.

Robert Loggia, another old favorite, plays the perfect counterpoint to the worrying, watchful grandpa. As the chef of the restaurant as well as the brother-in-law to O'Connor, the two argue and work in a well choreographed duet of talent. They sing, they dance, they plot and scheme, all the while engaging in their favorite long-standing debates on best ball players, singers, and different forms of poker. The rest of the comic characters playing the staunchly loyal staff inhabiting an establishment that caters to people who love Irish and Italian cooking are superb. All are old hands of the movie biz and work off each other like they made it all up at a family reunion after the keg was tapped.

I always have good things to say about James Belushi. In his early days it must have been quite a struggle with an actor/comic brother like the ill-fated John Belushi. But its clear that he's grown past the hammy college humor of that time period and in my opinion is undervalued as his perfomance here. As Bonny Hunt's high school sweetheart turned fireman husband he gives a great run at the stresses and successes of marriages that work. Fast paced laugh lines speed through his mouth as he makes a clumsy attempt to set Gracie up with a recently defrocked priest. Hunt and Belushi keep up the rat-a-tat with husband/wife banter that sprinkles stardust on the nagging and serves it up with a touch of wry. He does a chippendale number for his wife and Gracie that's gross, hysterical, and sweet as Hunt looks on with more than a spark of what brought them together five children ago.

I think that this movie is a must have DVD to watch together and often. It handles really tough issues like death, lasting love, the emergence of sexual stirrings, true physical beauty, and a happy old age. The young romance of Duchovny and Driver is contrasted by the doting old family cheering in the background. A very funny sidekick to Duchovny is shown with his parade of pick-up dates joining his friend at a bowling alley (""I thought you said this was a bar?!"" ""Yeah, you wanna beer?""). In astonishment the hip black playa watches his friend pretend to bowl because he finds Gracie's family a nurturing and encouraging group. Slowly he finds out that love means something more than you find in a cocktail on top of great curves.

All of this, the super writing, acting, and music is absolutely clean enough to show to any age. Even the occasional profanity or vulgar reference are properly packaged in the context of an ordinary, stable, loving family. Belushi is especially funny with his little mini-me son who parrots every single verbal indescretion at the worst possible moment.

Bob (Duchovny) and Elizabeth (Richardson) had a great life.  She loved caring for the apes at the zoo and he was building an enclosure to make the animals lives even better.  They'd like to take a trip to Italy--maybe after the new building is done.

Then, a tragic accident claimed her life.  Bob signs away his wife's heart and tries to go on with his life.

Grace (Driver) who's had a heart condition most of her life, is about to die.  She gets word she's getting a heart. The surgery's successful, but she mourns that someone had to die to get her life.  It takes her a year to send a thank-you note to the donor family.

Life does get better for Grace.  She's out of the hospital, she's painting and dreaming of going to Italy, but has never been on a plane...

While Bob is out on a disastrous blind date, he meets Grace.  She's waitressing his table.  He ditches his date and accidentally leaves his phone at the restaurant O'Reilly's Italian, run by Grace's grandfather (O'Connor) and his lovable poker playing cronies.

The rest is predictable and history, but is still worth seeing. ""Return to Me"" is a heartfelt comedy and a pleasant evening.

Minnie Driver, in particular, as the virginal Grace (this is a very catholic movie) has never been better as the object of Duchovny's chaste affection. The main question of the movie is how Duchovny will react when he learns about Grace's history - and how that will affect their relationship. The film is also a paean to a particular milieu - working class ethnic America, particularly the Italian, Polish and Irish groups that intersect in Chicago - that is fast disappearing as a result of assimilation.",1171670400,,786,4.744525547445256

1108428,5,6306012400,"This wonderful film from Bonnie Hunt has a quiet magic rarely seen in film these days. Hunt and Don Lake wrote the screenplay from an original story hatched with Andrew Stern and Samantha Goodman. As with everything Hunt has been involved in, there is a quiet class to every moment in the film.

David Duchovny was the perfect choice for Bob, a successful building engineer very much in love with his wife, Elizabeth (Joely Richardson). Elizabeth has a tender passion for a Gorilla named Sidney, whom she has taught sign language. Raising money for a new habitat for Sidney and his expanding family is her purpose in life. It is a passion cut short, however, when a car accident suddenly takes her from Bob's life in an instant.

Hunt's screenplay and her direction are both marvelous here. Elizabeth is not just a set-up character for the rest of the story, but rather someone real. So is the relationship between she and Bob. Because Hunt's direction takes the time to make the couple's love real, it is all the more poignant when tragedy strikes. Duchovny's scene where he is slumped against his front door, sobbing with his dog Mel looking on for a love never coming back is touching and very real.

Months go by and Bob goes to pot. Mel, who still sits by the front door waiting for Elizabeth to return, is a constant reminder of his loss. His pal Charlie (David Alan Grier) takes him to O'Reilly's, an Irish-Italian place, on a disasterous blind date. Hunt mixes humor with the pathos, and a pretentious bit about bottled water will lead the audience to laughter and Bob to the sweet and funny Gracie.

Minnie Driver is simply adorable as Grace, a girl who rides her bike everywhere and worries that she might die and leave her grandfather Matty (Carroll O'Connor) with no one to look after. He has raised her and her concern is very real. She had been near death when a heart suddenly became available and she was given a second chance at life. At the urging of her good friend, portrayed winningly by Hunt herself, she sends an anonymous letter to the surviving relative of the donor thanking them for her heart. She does not know, of course, that the heart which beats in her chest belonged once to Elizabeth.

The romance of Bob and Grace is filled with sweetness and charm. He still misses his wife but comes to ache for Gracie. While their romance blooms, there are wonderful scenes of Matty and his pals talking about baseball and singers, comparing Sinatra and Bing to Dean and Vinton. Bob becomes a part of the group, accepted immediately because, like them, his wife has died. Robert Loggia is a real standout as the cook, Angelo.

Gracie's self-consciousness about her scar will give she and Bob time to fall in love. But all is shattered in a moment when she discovers her letter in his home, along with a newspaper detailing his wife's accident. Not even the gift of a vintage bicycle can prevent her from using the ticket to Rome her grandpa has given her, hoping Bob will come after her. There is a truly moving moment when Matty takes Bob aside and offers an explanation for all that has happened.

Before Hunt brings us to a wonderful ending there is some great music mixed in with the warmth and humor of this fine film. Even Jackie Gleason's sweet and pure orchestra version of ""Tenderly"" is used. Jim Belushi is marvelous as Hunt's funny and down-to-earth husband. There isn't a wrong note in this entire film. This is what a romantic date movie should be but seldom is. Minnie Driver riding her bicycle in the middle of the night just to tell her friend Megan (Bonnie Hunt) she has finally met someone is so endearing you will never forget it. It is small moments and touches like that which place this film miles ahead of other romantic comedies.

If you've never seen this then you are in for a real treat. It is sweet and funny, simple and touching. A great movie to own.",1158019200,9,3901,4.578796561604585

Carroll O'Connor and his friends are great scene stealers and really provide solid comedy. James Belushi as well does his thing and does not let down.

The characters are developed well, even the supporting cast.  The film makes you care for each of them and feel as if you know them.

1108462,5,6306012400,"Return to me is one of my favorite movies. It is both a drama and a romantic comedy. I alternately cry and laugh throughout the whole film.  The story takes place in Chicago and is about a man named Bob (played by hot David Duchovny) who is madly in love with his wife of 15 years.  She unexpectedly dies one evening in a car crash, which of course leaves him devasted and convinced he will never fall in love again.  About a year later he meets a young woman named Grace (played beautifully by Minnie Driver)who works as a waitress in her grandfather's restaurant. She has lived a very sheltered life due to her parents early death and her health problems.  She and Bob fall in love almost immediately when he comes into her restaurant one day while on a terrible blind date.  Grace and Bob date for several months.  Grace keeps a secret from him- she is too afraid of telling him she had a heart transplant for fear he will not be attracted to her once he sees her large scar.  She almost tells him one evening at his house but doesn't when she discovers his wife died on the day she received a new heart. I won't tell anymore about the rest of the film.  I don't want to spoil the ending.  This movie has no sex or violence which I appreciate.

I like both romance films and action flicks (Go Seagal!), but I find that much of the romance films that Hollywood has produced in recent years are...less than stellar, let's say.  And most of the leading ladies are quite dreary, IMHO. (Don't EVEN get me started on Meg Ryan!  Does that woman ever play a different character, or do all the screenwriters just write ""Meg Ryan acts like herself....again""?!?)

Not this film.  David and Minnie are wonderful as a couple falling in love.  David's ache for his lost wife and new love are almost palpable.  Minnie's extended family are HILARIOUS.  And Bonnie Hunt and James Belushi absolutely steal many of the scenes that they are in!

Kudos to Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake for writing such a wonderful movie.  More! More!

1108507,4,6306012400,"The idea of a man falling in love with a woman, who has received the heart of his late wife in a transplant operation, is a story fraught with peril.  One of the most wrenchingly emotional scenes I have ever seen on television was on ""St. Elsewhere"" where Jack Morrison (David Morse) listened to the heart of his wife beating in the body of another woman.  So how ""Return to Me"" gets to that moment when Bob Rueland (David Duchovny) listens to the heart of his late wife, Elizabeth (Joely Richardson), beating in Grace Briggs (Minnie Driver) is, at least for me, a delicate matter.  Fortunately, this romantic comedy has Bonnie Hunt, not only playing Grace's best friend, Megan Dayton, but also as the director and the screenwriter, along with Don Lake.  That means there are some brains to go along with ample heart in this romantic comedy from 2000.

""Return to Me"" begins by going back and forth between the two characters in Chicago whose lives and love will collide.  Bob is an architect and one of his planned projects is to create a new living space for the gorillas at the Lincoln Park Zoo where Elizabeth has been raising money for the effort.  Meanwhile, Grace is in the hospital waiting for a heart and being visited by her grandfather, Marty O'Reilly (Carroll O'Connor), and her friend, Megan.  On the night that a dinner is held to celebrate having raised enough money for the zoo project, there is an accident.  We know that Elizabeth's heart is intended for Grace, so Hunt does not bother to play out everything.  We do not see the accident because it is a necessary evil to the story, where the consequences matter much more than needlessly witnessing the event.  Instead the preparations for the operation take place in contrast to Bob giving way to grief at the loss of the woman he loves.  But something sweet happens: once Elizabeth's heart starts beating again, Bob finally finds enough peace to fall asleep.

We then come to the most delicate part of the story: how Bob and Grace will meet.  There is an unspoken sense of magic behind what happens in this film, which would explain why it is that Bob and Grace first pass each other at the Monkey House at the Zoo.  There is no meeting, but significantly enough Grace pauses because her heart has started to beat more rapidly.  This is a good sign, and an even better one comes when he is persuaded by a friend, Charlie Johnson (David Alan Grier), to O'Reilly's Italian Restaurant.  Grace works as a waitress in her grandfather's place, where the cooking is done by Angelo Pardipillo (Robert Loggia), and the ongoing debates are over the relative value of Irish (Bing Crosby) versus Italian (Dean Martin) singers.  Bob's date is just not a nice person and when Grace flings back a zinger at her rude condescension, Bob is interested.

The rest of the movie obviously consists of tentative romance, where hand holding is more important than sex, and with the full understanding that at the point where they are happiest the truth will come out and have to be dealt with.  At that point we get the movie's best line, ""What was God thinking?""  The line is so great because it is not only funny but it speaks to the film's persistent notion that there is a greater power at work here, even if it turns out to be simply love and not a mischievous deity.  My only complaint, such as it is, would be that ""Return to Me"" fails to come up with a payoff at the end as good as the setup.  Then again, the ending is predictable according to the formula, so it is hard to really come up with a great ""how"" under those circumstances.  But the film is certainly sweet enough for you to weep at the right moments and even if you do not end up crying your eyes out, this is still a laudable effort.

Hunt and Lake also get credit for giving the supporting cast some great bits that justify their showing up.  In addition to O'Connor and Loggia having fun at the Irish Italian restaurant, there are Eddie Jones, Marianne Muellerleile, and William Bronder to add zest to the spicy exchanges.  There is only one deleted scene on this DVD, but it is this quintet singing ""Danny Boy,"" and then debating the song.  Jim Belushi plays Joe Dayton and joins with Hunt in double-teaming everybody else in stealing scenes.  Duchovny and Driver are the only ones required to carry heavy emotional baggage and they acquit themselves well in that regard, but the one who really shines is O'Connor as the warm but understated grandfather.  There was no doubt when the moment came for him to say the right thing to the right person at the right time, that he was going to deliver.  The same can be said for Bonnie Hunt's film.",1099008000,11,4664,4.556354916067146

I can watch it with my children, I can watch it with my inlaws, I can watch it with my mother, and I am never embarrassed by it.

The sound track is phenominal.  What fabulous music!! I hear that soundtrack a lot at wedding receptions. . .how much more romantic can ya get?  Carroll OConnor and Robert Loggia make the movie for me and my family.  As the grandfather and uncle by marriage of the lead character, Gracie, OConnor and Loggia give genuinely loving performances.

This film is somewhat courageous in the way it wears its heart on its sleeve in these days when any spark of sentiment is usually couched in irony.  Bob Rueland (David Duchovny) has lost his beloved wife (Joely Richardson) in a traffic accident; Grace Briggs (Minnie Driver) has received her heart in a transplant operation.  It's not giving anything away to let you know that fate brings them together in the end.  As soon as the film opens, you know that it couldn't go any other way./

It must be difficult to make such an innocent story work for today's audiences, but writer/director Bonnie Hunt (with co-screenwriter Don Lake) pulls it off.

I suppose this was intended to be one of those ""feel good movies of the year"" and despite the enormous charm of Minnie Driver and David ""I'm too good for the X-files"" Duchovny, this movie is surprisingly void of any appeal or magic.  Instead we end up with a big fat mess of flibbityflam.

It is piled high with oh-so-cute odd ball characters who are not so cute and the love story made me want to break out singing ""it's a small world after all...."". The spinach pizza I was eating at the time I watched this movie started doing loop-de-loops in my tummy and even though that may sound like fun, it's not.

It probably would have worked better as a black comedy: ""You've won my heart, my dearest"" ""Ahhh, and your dead wife's too"" kiss kiss

Do I sound bitter? Do I sound bitter for throwing away nearly 2 hours of my outrageously wonderful life to watch this glop of cheese whiz - huh? Well, I gave it two whole stinkin' stars, didn`t I?

David Duchovny had a little more trouble with his role it seemed, but overall his character is enjoyable as well. The real triumph here, however, is the supporting cast. Lead by Bonnie Hunt (whom I love) they were all drop-dead hilarious and loveable. I would strongly recommend this film.

David Dechovny (The X-Files' Mulder) and Minnie Driver (Good Will Hunting) were great together as Bob and Grace! Cynical as I am, I actually believed they loved each other! You probably know the plot by now, about how Grace (Driver) is in need of a new heart and ends up receiving Duchovny's wife (who dies in an accident)'s heart. Now, this sounds like it could veer off into pitter-pat-land, but Bonnie Hunt (writer / director / co-star) keeps it cool! There's lots of humor and sarcasm. Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi are hysterical as Grace's married (with children) friends. Carrol O'Conner and Robert Loggia shine as co-owners of the restaurant where Grace works (O'Conner's character is her grandather). David Alan Grier is excellent as Bob's best friend.

This is a poignant, romantic comedy that works off the premise that the love of a good heart gone astray will triumph over all obstacles, and find its way back to where it belongs. And yet, in spite of its kitschy premise, this movie works.
David Duchovny (X-Files) plays Chicago architect Bob Rueland, whose zoo-director wife, Elizabeth (Joely Richardson), was killed in a car crash. (Good! The establishing scenes at the beginning, that present the wife as beyond saintly, are the worst part of the film. Diabetics are warned that the first ten minutes may be dangerous to their health.) Minnie Driver is young, aspiring artist Grace Briggs, who will die, if she doesn't get a heart transplant. She gets Bob's late wife's heart.
Bob grieves. His friends (most notably David Alan Grier, as zoo vet Charlie Johnson) grieve. His dog grieves. Even the ape at the zoo grieves.
Meanwhile, Grace may have a heart, but she doesn't have a life. She waits tables for her Irish uncle, Marty O'Reilly (Carroll O'Connor), and his old friend, Angelo Pardipillo (Robert Loggia), at the Irish-Italian restaurant they own together. Grace's extended family tries to set her up, e.g., with a man who tends to lapse back into his former vocation as a priest.
Meanwhile, Bob's friend Charlie sets him up with obnoxious blind dates that make grieving look like fun.
Eventually, the stars cross paths, and -- some complications notwithstanding -- their lives are made new.
But you know what? This movie is so much better than its synopsis. That's because its real star is Bonnie Hunt, the ubiquitous character actress who directed, co-wrote, and (if memory serves) co-produced the movie. (Though it doesn't say so at amazon.com's IMDB, I could have sworn Hunt's credits included producer, when I saw this as an in-flight movie.) Except for the first few minutes, Hunt often comes dangerously close to cloying sentimentality, without crossing the line.
And while the chemistry between the stars is good, David Duchovny and Minnie Driver are no Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh. Recognizing this, Hunt exquisitely cast a bevy of supporting roles that carry the movie, from David Alan Grier's skirt-chasing veterinarian, Charlie Johnson, to Chicago's own James Belushi, as working-class husband Joe Dayton (whose wife, Megan, is played by Hunt) to the old men of the restaurant (O'Connor, Loggia, Eddie Jones). She even gets dramatic mileage out of the animals. And any moviemaker who can come up with a good, sizeable role for Carroll O'Connor has something on the ball, in my book [this review was originally published in 2000, before O'Connor's death]. The highest compliment I can pay Bonnie Hunt the director, is that she doesn't waste a single scene or role.
The other thing Hunt does well is to present two kinds of romance. There's the falling-in-love kind we expect from this sort of movie, as well as another kind you almost never see in pictures: the wry, wisecracking fell-in-love, stayed-in-love romance of Belushi and Hunt's Joe and Megan Dayton, who by now have a mess of kids.
Hunt and her collaborator, Don Lake, came up with some good lines, and can be forgiven for taking the shtick from Norman Jewison's Moonstruck of using a Dean Martin song (""Return to Me"") as a running, romantic theme.
Return to Me is a good choice for the date who's coming over to the house for the first time, or the ""date"" whose name has shared space on mailboxes with yours for many years.",1051574400,10,3476,4.923339011925043

1108576,4,6306012400,"Whenever someone asks me, 'Why doesn't Hollywood make sweet old-fashioned romances the way it did back in the old days?' I reply that with RETURN TO ME it did. Director Bonnie Hunt sets up a premise that could easily have been carried off by Rock and Doris, but David Duchovny and Minnie Driver generate the same palpable magnetism that resonated with audiences of a previous generation.  Bob (Duchovny) and Elizabeth (Joely Richardson) are happily married, and the film starts off to be about them.  Then jarringly, she dies in an auto accident, leaving him to grieve as best he can.  Director Hunt juxtaposes Elizabeth's death with the rebirth of Grace (Driver), who needs a heart transplant, and guess who is the donor?  Hunt, who also shines in a supporting role as Grace's best friend, strings together these two strands of disjointed lives, slowly at first with blind date pitfalls with others before allowing them to meet and heal.  Bob loves and misses Elizabeth while Grace feels that her devotion to her ill grandfather precludes a normal love life. Yet, they connect and as they do, they find that they match up right in all the little ways that count.  Robert Loggia, Carrol O'Connor, and Bonnie Hunt interact as a variation of the Greek chorus that comments on the plot but says things that the main characters are probably thinking but dare not say. James Belushi, who usually plays the lead, is the second banana as Bonnie Hunt's husband, and in their own relation seem to be a future version of what Bob and Grace's could be. There is a plot complication of course.  When the source of Grace's heart becomes known to her and Bob, both are overwhelmed with a sense of weirdness.  How both cope with it is the only serious note of the film, aside from Elizabeth's early exit.  What RETURN TO ME is represents a celebration of the discovery of a fount of joy that tragedy can slow down but never quite derail.",1030579200,,1922,4.696428571428571
1108577,5,6306012400,"Somebody give Bonnie Hunt a leading role quick! She is such a vibrant actress that she shouldn't be the supporting role in every film she does (The American President, Jerry Maguire, The Green Mile). And now she surprises us even more by directing, writing, and starring in Return to Me, a warm, appealing movie filled with laughter.
David Duchovny (The X-Files) plays Bob, an architect whose zoologist wife (Joely Richardson) is killed in a car accident. Minnie Driver (Oscar-nominee for Good Will Hunting) plays Grace, who is desperately in need of a heart transplant. She benefits from Bob's tragedy when she is given his late wife's heart. Eventually Bob winds up in Grace's diner and her grandpa (the late, brilliant Carroll O'Connor, All in the Family) and his friends line the two up. Of course nobody knows that Grace has Bob's dead wife's heart (say that ten times fast!).
Hunt plays Grace's best friend and steals virtually every scene she's in. She has five rambunctious children and a beer-drinking husband (James Belushi) who seems less mature than his kids do. While the scenes between Duchovny and Driver feel like an ode to Moonstruck, the scenes between Hunt and Belushi play more like a zany television sitcom. The can't get along, but we know they love each other a lot.
My one complaint about the film is that Hunt should have taken the role of Grace. She nearly overshadows everybody in the film and although Minnie Driver is fine as Grace, she just isn't as charming as Bonnie Hunt. Any smart Hollywood director would pass on the Demi Moore's and Sharon Stone's and give Bonnie Hunt a chance to be a leading lady.
The end of the film is a huge cliche, but the rest of the movie is so good it's forgivable. Original, witty, and charming, Return to Me sports great supporting performances by James Belushi, and Carroll O'Connor (among others). It's a fantastic movie that should please anyone with a taste for romance straight from the heart. Rated PG for light profanity.",1028505600,8,1992,4.810495626822157

THE STORY:
Bob Rueland's life is turned upside down when he tragically and unexpectedly loses his zoologist wife in a traffic accident.  Meanwhile, terminally ill Grace Brigg's life is forever changed when at the last minute she reveals the heart transplant that saves her life.  Fast forward a year when Bob and Grace meet, not knowing that their lives are now forever entwined...
THE COOL THINGS:
Overall, like most love stories this movie unfolds very nicely.  In addition to the powerful story about the very nature of this romance the movie also contains a ""nice"" comedic side courtesy of the members of Grace's extended Irish-Italian-American family as well as Bob's friends.  In all, this is a perfectly safe and ""family-friendly"" movie with good, clean fun.
THE DVD SPECIAL FEATURES:
Though a little sparse on DVD features compared to current standards, the offerings here though are a ""nice touch.""
1. Feature length audio commentary by Director Bonnie Hunt and Co-Writer Don Lake:  Always an interesting listen.
2. Music Video:  ""What If I Loved You"" by Joey Gian.  Nice
3. One Deleted Scene:  Danny Boy.  Nice and funny bit with Grace's uncles, grandparents, etc crooning out that old tune.
THE VERDICT:
Admitted, the story is sad but the story is done nicely and the ending ties up everything nicely.  Overall, I'd say this is a perfect movie for a couple to curl up into on the couch for a nice evening viewing (be it bought or rented).",1025308800,7,1616,4.886446886446887

 David Duchovny and Minnie Driver star as Gracie Briggs and Bob Rueland, two people who are brought together with more than fate, but also a heart.  When disaster and devastation hits Bob, he unselfishly donates his wife's organs.  Gracie is in desperate need for a heart after suffering for many years with heart disease. Her heart finally does come, at the most needed moment, and it is a special heart at that.
 It takes over a year for Bob to get back in the dating scene, and that's only with help from Charlie played by David-Alan Grier.  When the date lands them in Gracies grandfather's (Carroll O'Connor) restaurant, Gracie is their waitress, and it's love at first sight, and their lives will be forever changed.
 There is also great classic songs that sprinkle this movie with class and romance.  Songs like ""At Long Last Love"" by Frank Sinatra and ""Tenderly"" by Jackie Gleason finish the movie off without any hitches only adding more detail.  Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake take their first stab at writing, directing, and starring in Return To Me, and I must say it is one movie that reminds me the most of the classic romances of long ago.
 Please note that if you like this film, Bonnie and Don are writing and directing a tv show on ABC this fall, called Life With Bonnie.

It is an example of how sometimes they do make them like they used to. Except for its plot device about a heart transplant, it could have just as likely been made forty years ago with Deborah Kerr and David Niven.
Bob Rueland [David Duchovny] is a successful Chicago contractor still madly in love with his wife, who was his high school sweetheart. [I told you the picture was old-fashioned.] Meanwhile, across town, Grace Briggs [Minnie Driver] is a very sick young woman awaiting a heart transplant. When Bob's wife is killed in an auto accident, none other than Grace receives the dead woman's heart. A year later, we see the changes in the soon-to-meet pair's lives. He is still grieving and proves difficult to be around. Grace is recovered and is working at her grandfather's restaurant. She's a shy, artistic girl who is very self-conscious. Someone who has been bypassed love, Grace thinks the unsightly scar on her chest makes remote her chances of finding someone . Bob, of course, isn't looking for anyone. Worn down by the badgering of his well meaning best friend, he agrees to a blind date. This disastrous date occurs in the very restaurant Grace works in. I imagine you can fill in the rest of the story.
David Duchovny is working hard to get away from his X-Files' character, and here is does a decent job in a role which requires him to change his personality from carefree to gloomy and back again. As Grace, Minnie Driver is excellent. I don't know Ms. Driver, but I always picture her as the sort of person who lights up a room whenever she walks in. She certainly brighten ups any movie she's in. Still, it is Carroll O'Connor as Marty O'Reilly, the grandfather, who steals the show. He and his cronies, played by Robert Loggia, David Alan Grier and Marianne Muellerleile, are delightful as very wise and very nosey senior citizens. A funnier group of matchmakers you are unlikely to see anytime soon.
Return to Me is the directorial debut of Bonnie Hunt, who also costars in the movie. Though playing it safe at every turn, she still demonstrates that she has a knack for the job.

But, from the very beginning through the predictable ending - I was hooked! It doesn't matter that you know something is going to go wrong. It doesn't matter that you know the twist before any of the characters figure it out. It's the journey that makes you feel good.

1108634,5,6306012400,"This movie was a bit of a box-office flop, but I can't imagine why -- it's sweet, wholesome and funny, to boot.
David Duchovny is Bob, a man who lost his wife in a car accident and is having trouble recovering from his loss. Minnie Driver is Grace, a young woman who recently had a heart transplant; she's never been able to do many things, like dating or traveling. She was raised by her devout grandfather (Carroll O'Connor), who owns an Irish-Italian restaurant, and his equally sweet, elderly cronies. Bonnie Hunt (the director) plays Grace's best friend, Megan, and Jim Belushi is her crude but loving police-officer husband. All of the actors are likable and believable in their roles.
I was especially touched by the unabashed displays of faith: Grace's grandfather says the rosary during her surgery and asks others to. Characters go to church. Megan and her husband have a typically large, boisterous Catholic family.
This movie doesn't have a mean bone in its body. (Do movies have bones? Or bodies?) There isn't a character here you won't like. The humor is sweet and gentle, and your kids can even watch it. (A little kissing is as racy as it gets, though there are a couple of traumatic scenes after Bob's wife dies.)

David Duchovny is Bob Rueland a doting and affible husband, Grace (Minnie Driver) is in desperate need of a heart. Well as fate would have it, Bob's wife is seriously injured and her heart is given to Grace. Unbeknowst to each other, the two meet up a year later and begin a whirlwind romance.
Although the premise may seem a bit far fetched, Bonnie Hunt Director/Co-Star pulls it off with great finesse. David Duchovny is utterly charming and Minnie Driver is wonderfully sweet without having that disgustingly overdone wholesome feel. The two are so believable you can't help but love it. The supporting cast really completes this whole picture, James Belushi as Hunt's well-meaning but blundering husband, Robert Loggia as Grace's uncle is magnificent, and Carrol O'Conner is fantastic as Grace's over-protective Grandfather.

The two meet and romance blossoms. The two then learn that she has the heart of his deceased wife and..well, I won't tell you. You'll have to see it. This is a sweet and pretty charming movie. I have to admit it. Duchovny shows that there is life for him after ""The X Files"". The two best parts about this film are the group of guys that hang out in the restaraunt. Carroll 'o' Connor and Robert Loggia among them. They are very good. The other best part is co-writer and director Bonnie Hunt(who is always a delight) and Jim Belushi as the married couple friends to Minnie Driver. I'm not a fan of Ms. Driver's, and this film doesn't change that. She is decent, I guess. David Alan Grier is pretty much wasted in a nothing role as Duchovny's best friend.

No over-acting here, just simple, quiet reality. A nationally-known reviewer commented on the men's poker group in this picture, saying it was a waste of time, but he was wrong. It just made this a more real place, with real people like your uncles or a friend's father or the guys who hang around your local convenience store. The love story is also more like real life than the wild things that go on in too many movies.
I put ""Return to Me"" right up there with ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and other movies of the golden era of Hollywood.

(So now I need to see their other movies!)
The oh-so-talented Hunt writes, directs, and acts in this wonderful story about people you wish you knew. To me the mark of a great film is one that is inhabited by characters you root for, that you love and that you hope make it through whatever they're enduring.  In short it has characters you care for, and in this aspect ""Return to Me"" is a perfect ten. I thought I would never see this film--now it's one of my favorites of recent years. Carol O'Connor, Robert Loggia, Jim Belushi and a host of solid supporting actors/characters add to the joy that makes ""Return to Me"" such a gem.  This DVD-version ranks among our family's favorite nights in front of the screen!

1108700,4,6306012400,"This is a cute little movie that will best fit for a lonely evening every girl sometimes happen to have. The plot fits into a nutshell (and is one of the most unsophisticated ones I've ever encountered): Bob's wife dies in a car-crash and her heart is transplanted to Grace. In a year Bob meets Grace and falls in love with her. Can you guess what hinders their happiness? Like J.Belushi's character justly noticed: ""His wife's heart? So what?"" I couldn't agree more with him, for taking into consideration the whole light tone of the movie, this obstacle does not seem to be serious. But that's the golden rule of a melodrama - there must be an obstacle for lovers to overcome.
I usually dislike such illogical tear-jerkers, but this time I've enjoyed watching Duchovny and Driver interacting: Duchovny as handsome and charming Bob, sensitive and forlorn (all his emotions reflecting in his eyes), Driver as a simple and perplexed Grace, so desperately wanted to find her happiness. The movie is full of little funny and touching moments (thank God, no toilet humor, no nudity, no forced gags). However, the show is stolen by Grace's elderly grandmas and uncles, putting their efforts together to organize Grace's happiness: they have the best jokes and keep you smiling instantly, they give the movie its ""warm"" flavor. I'm adding one more star for their performance!
And although I've rented this movie just to look at DD, the movie succeeds in reaching its goal: to show how love is born and how it transforms a man; that we all long for a family life with its sad and happy moments.  It's definitely a ""chick-flick"", but a nice one.",992217600,,1637,4.764084507042254

David Duchovny, who plays the male romantic lead in the film, performs probably one of the most romantic gestures (This is just my opinion.) that I'd ever seen on film.  And it seemed so real! It wasn't sappy or corny, it was just so sweet and you have to watch the movie to see it!  I could rehash the scenerio,but if you've been reading all these reviews, which almost all of them have been excellent!  alot of people seemed to really love this film.  I wasnt' sure if I would like it as I am not a big fan of Minnie Driver.  She turned out to be very good in it, and it was a good role for her.  All the other actors were great.  Jim Belushi steals the show as the husband of Bonnie Hunt(one of the screenwriters).  Hunt is also a scene stealer, and usually plays that type of role.  I am a fan of hers and when I realized she wrote this, well, I had to see this for myself.  I know quite a few people who'd seen the movie already, and they all loved it. It's funny, heartwarming, and there is something for everybody in this movie.  My husband even liked it!  He laughed alot.  Archie Bunker himself, plays the grandfather to Minnie Driver, and him and his buddies are all so funny!!! They have quite a few scenes in the film.  In Closing, I would definitely recommend ""Return to me"" for a feel good romantic kind of comedy.  Oh, and don't forget the kleenex!!",992044800,,1481,4.198581560283688

An effortless scene stealer whatever the film (""Beethoven"", ""Jerry Maguire"", ""The Green Mile""), she proves with ""Return to Me"" that she is also a gifted director and writer. In this sweet film of fate and love, Hunt and writing partner Don Lake (watch for his cameo as the ""hair guy"" at the bar!) take an original idea and give it life- great characters, great lines, and great performances from the entire cast (Hunt is actually the standout, along with James Belushi as her husband).

The scenes were David Duchovny returns home after the accident were particularly poignant, as was the scene where Minnie Driver's character visits the doctor and makes the comment that since she has been given the ""gift of life""  she isn't entitled to having a bad day.  This is right on the money.  Many transplant recipients feel that they should never be unhappy and feel guilty when they are.  This movie accurately shows how normal people, thrust into extraordinary situations, face the issue of donation and transplantation.  My only suggestion would have been to include some of the sobering statistics about donation to increase the tension and doubt about Minnie's character getting a transplant.  The supporting cast is great, Robert Loggia, and  Carroll O'Connor's characters make you want to be a part of their family, to go to their restaurant, and to play a game of poker with them.

This film is not a ""chick flick"" as the preview may make it look. My father and husband loved it as much as I did - in fact, my father recommended to me. The new romance, involving a superb performance by Duchovney, and a decent performance by Driver (she borders on cheesy a couple of times - but makes up for it with some hilarious facial expressions), is pure and sweet instead of just lusty like so many modern flicks. The seasoned romance between married couple Hunt and Belushi almost steals the film. Belushi is one of the brightest points of the film and no one could be his equal in a scene except Hunt.
Carol O'Connor gives probably the best performance in the whole film and his card pals will make you roll with laughter. David Duchovney's blind date is the funniest female I've seen on screen in a long time - you love to hate her and laugh at her at the same time. I hope to see her again. Scene after scene creates a tapestry of hilarious and touching characters rather than focusing all the attention on the leads. Few films are able to do that. This is truly a modern classic that you will pull for repeat performances again and again.

I think it is so sad that more people did not go to the theaters and see this film because it is one of the very best romantic comedies I have ever seen.
There was a review written by a gentlemen that I read that discussed David Duchovny's acting ability in this movie. That gentleman was wrong. Duchovny is wonderful in this role and he does a crying seen like I have never seen before. He had to really be crying because you could just feel the emotion. It was heartbreaking. Now maybe I am alittle sappy sometimes but his acting was a very nice change from Mulder on the X-Files and he did a remarkable job with this character. Duchovny is a fine actor and his range shone through in this character. The chemistry he shared with Minnie Driver was wonderful. They made a very sweet couple that you so wanted their relationship to work out. The thing I really liked about this movie was the atmosphere of family and the humor that surrounded it. When Driver comes downstairs to cover her flowers from the cold and she has a showercap on her head and she is in a robe and then Duchovny stands up and she realizes who it is ...the look on her face is priceless. This is definitely a situation that could really happen and they did it with such flair. Minnie is very funny in the film and Bonnie Hunt just goes without saying. Her and her husbands characters added even more laughter to the film. They were both just hilarious. Carroll O'Conner played a sweet loveable grandfather anyone would be proud to have. Also this movie is one that the whole family can watch together or a great movie to watch alone and just get so involved with the characters. Women will fall in love with Duchovny and men will fall in love with Driver. You will cheer at the end and walk away very satisfied. I can't wait to add it to my movie collection.

First off, the concept of a heart transplant also transplanting emotion is very sentimental. And it works!. At least for the first few encounters. The problem is the screenwriter stops following the idea past the first few encounters between the two. At first, her heart beats audibly whenever they are near and then nothing, unless you consider the statement that she was feeling hot a carry through.
There is also a very contrived ""trip to Italy"" with foreshadowing about as subtle as a baseball bat to the head. While it sets up one of the more emotional moments of the film, it is also the most inane plot device I have seen in a film in quite some time.
Minnie Driver is excellent in the film, doing a good job with a lackluster script. David Duchovny, however, is fair to midline at best; in portions of the film, his acting is so wooden that it breaks the illusion. And, Carol O'Connor is overall believable, but misses his Irish accent a few times in the movie.
Final analysis: Compared to some of the other tripe coming out of Hollywood, this is not a bad film. I rate it a bit less than average, but I am comparing it to films throughout history and not those of the past few years. If you want a good cry, there are plenty of tearjerking moments (both happy and sad) to satisfy your appetite. And, once it gets going, the chemistry between Duchovny and Driver is nice.

1108729,5,6306012400,"Okay, everyone has talked about how great the story is and how engaging the actors are. Let me say some good things about the director's commentary. This was Bonnie Hunt's first movie as a director, and it's clear that she's tickled with it. It's also clear that she used to do standup comedy and hang with Second City.
These commentary tracks seem to be pretty informal affairs. It can be a real chore to sit through one unless the speakers know how to entertain the audience. Hunt does a fine job. She gets a couple of running gags going, like her strategy to save production (hotel) costs. She has a few pointers for ""film school"" people. She points out every friend and relative in the production, who has speaking parts, why others don't, and so on.
Incidentally, Hunt also talks about how they crafted the screenplay and the film. She talks about how they set up particular characters, fought the studio to leave things in and why, and point out the payoffs when they come. She was also frank about some tough decisions she made about cut scenes.
Overall, I found Hunt's commentary entertaining, informative and, well, charming.",979084800,,1134,4.732323232323233

The supporting cast truly makes this film a winner.  Carroll O'Conner, Robert Loggia, and their fellow cronies provide numerous big laughs throughout the movie.

When Bob (David Duchovony) and his wife are involved in a tragic accident, Bob lives and his poor wife Elizabeth dies.  Meanwhile Grace (Minnie Driver) will die if she does not get a heart transplant. The first scene she is in, is in a hospital, waiting for a heart.  Not surprisingly, Grace gets Elizabeth's heart, and the next scene Bob is in, he is mourning for his wife, and you can hear the heart beating in the backround.  Also, no surprise here, Bob and Grace develop a romance, and Grace has to try and keep her scar hidden. Bob does not know that Grace has had a heart transplant, and he also of course does not know it is his wifes heart.  This is an wonderful romantic comedy, and is classic. But for me, seeing David Duchonony play Bob, when I'm used to seeing him as Mulder, was strange. I rate this movie five-stars, because it was wonderfully written, with the classic love story, and is probably the best romance movie since CHARADES.",978220800,3,1047,4.489473684210527

While we wait for kismet to bring these two characters together, we are treated to a fine (and impressive) supporting cast of characters head by Carroll O'Connor, Robert Loggia, David Alan Grier, James Belushi, and writer-director Bonnie Hunt.  There is little suspense that the two main characters will find each other and in the end find new life and love -- but this is the movies after all!
For DVD buyers and renters, the true gem is the audio commentary by Bonnie Hunt and co-writer Don Lake.  This highly recommended bonus to the DVD version is at least worth another ""star.""  Hunt, who is one of the best interviewees on talk shows, engages in a informative and a very humorous dialogue with Lake throughout the movie.  By all means, after watching the movie go back and watch the movie again with Hunt and Lake.  Hunt's dry humor will make you laugh out loud at times as she speaks of her bad make-up job in her first scene to the seemingly dozens of family members that she placed throughout the film.  You will also get a real appreciation for the art of film-making.  ""Return To Me"" was Hunt's directorial debut and it is fascinating to listen to the care and meticulous detail that she placed into this film (music selections, editing, etc.).

I have to say thank you to Bonnie Hunt and all of TPTB for making a movie I can see with my parents and my grandparents without getting embarassed. There are so many movies out these days that I can't watch with them without my face turning red. This film was a perfect example that movies can be entertaining without being graphically sexual or violent. I am going to film school with the goal of making movies of a ""good"" or ""family"" nature, and this film was truly an inspiration.
It is witty. It is romantic. It is heartbreaking. I love the fact that it allows the audience to fall in love with Elizabeth and then fall in love with Grace, too. There is nothing making either one of Bob's loves better than the other. That's the way life normally is. Great job.
As an avid ""X-Files"" fan, I was a bit wary when I went into the theater as to how I could watch David Duchovny in another role. Much to my glee, I had no problem. The scene with the dog in front of the door breaks my heart everytime I watch it. Excellent job. Minnie Driver remains one of my fave actresses to this day. Helen Hunt and Mr. Belushi just cracked me up everytime they were onscreen. And, what else can I say, Carroll O'Connor and his crew were splendid. Of course, we can't forget Sydney either :)

1108783,3,6306012400,"Usually I'm a sap for romantic comedies and I give them a lot of latitude.  It is hard to come up with much that is fresh in a genre that has been so thoroughly plowed.  However, this charming and schmaltzy film was too corny even for me.  Romantic films are normally pretty predictable, but this was ridiculous.  Writer/director Bonnie Hunt gives these characters the depth of a rain puddle.  The plot was so scant that she had to employ excessive filler with farcical skits involving Jim Belushi, and the seniors led by Carroll O'Connor and Robert Loggia.  The fact that the filler was the most entertaining part of the film speaks volumes about the weakness of the main storyline.
Bonnie Hunt's directorial debut was a mixed bag.  She captured some endearing moments and her choice for Chicago locations was wonderful.  However, the film's pacing was poor, with numerous dull scenes and a bumpy flow.  The character development of Bob (David Duchovny) and Grace (Minnie Driver) was good, and the romance was enchanting, but there really wasn't that much of an impediment to the relationship.  A truly great romance requires an insurmountable obstacle or irreconcilable differences to be overcome to test the awesome power of love.  The heart transplant device, while novel, really wasn't much of a reason for them to break up.  Hunt also should have made greater use of the device examining its implications more explicitly with Duchovny's character.  She was content to dance around the fact that the two loves of his life had the same heart, a wonderful metaphor that she left in the background rather than developing it.
The acting was excellent.  David Duchovny proved to be quite affable in this retreat from the heavy-handed X-Files roles.  This may be the most he has been allowed to smile in any project he has ever taken.  It was enjoyable to see another side of him.  Minnie Driver gave a marvelous performance, probably her best to date.  She was very human; she was insecure about her surgery, but warm and full of hope.  Carroll O'Connor was priceless as Grace's grandfather.  He and Robert Loggia delivered some of the funniest moments in the film.  James Belushi was also hilarious as the overwrought dad and middle class stud muffin.
Though it proved to be a crowd pleaser, this film was a sweet but lightweight addition to an overcrowded genre.  I rated it a 6/10.  It's a good date movie but not much more.",975110400,,2427,4.823244552058111

I hope that the popularity of this story will help raise awareness to the need for more people to commit to being organ donors so many others can experience the real life side of this love story through such gifts of life.

Minnie Driver plays the role of Grace to perfection, from her earlier sick and dying scenes, to starting to embrace life as she is given a second chance to live.  Bonnie Hunt and James Belushi as Grace's best friends do a flawless job, and steal almost every scene that they are in.
The tone of the movie never gets too heavy handed, and the strong performances manage to keep the flow of the movie going without bogging it down too much.  If there was one thing I might have changed it would have been the scene with the dog, where it still waits by the door for Elizabeth(Bob's first wife) to come home, even though she's been dead for a year.

This movie is a wonderful, heartwarming event that is filled with comedy and tears.  While Duchovny and Driver are more than adequate in the roles, the real applause is for Carol O'Connor, Robert Loggia, and the other old curmudgeons that guide the two lovebirds on their quest for happiness.

1108840,5,6306012400,"Return to Me is a romantic comedy about two people who almost magically cross paths.  Grace Briggs is a woman in need of a heart transplant, and after many years of waiting, she finally recieves a donor heart.
 The flip side is that the heart she had so waited for belonged to the young wife of Bob Rueland (David Duchovny), who died tragically as the result of an automobile accident they were in.
 Time goes forward, when Bob, a Chicago based architect and builder is working feverishly to complete the addition to the monkey house at Lincoln Park Zoo as was the dream of his late wife.  He has let his work consume him and attempted to use this project as a means of squelching the pain of losing her.
 Grace, has made a wonderful recovery and is continuing on with life as a normal, healthy adult but wonders why she feels so empty despite how fortunate she feels to be alive.  Her love of painting and her love for those around her cannot fill a void she feels in her life.
 You must know it's coming, Bob and Grace meet.  He is on a blind date his best friend, Charlie (David Alan Grier) arranged for him.  The date is going very badly but the bright spot is the beautiful waitress, Grace.  They feel an instant connection to each other that is absolutely enchanting.
 The rest of the movie follows along their relationship, from the first awkward conversations to a sincere and honest loving existence.  I don't want to spoil some of the more specific relationship developments, other than to say that I was pleasantly surprised they dated without having to immediately jump in the sack together.  Actually, she is able to conceal her heart transplant scar with relative ease, not worrying about him noticing it as the result of any hanky panky because there is none.  They kiss and they hold hands.  It makes you sigh the sigh of first love, remembering the times when your hand touched the hand of your loved one, and you felt that spark of electricity.
 Obviously, the romance between Grace and Bob is the primary storyline in Return to Me.  However, there are so many other funny and interesting characters in the story that support the main storyline, rather than detract from it.  Carroll O'Connor is Marty O'Reilly, Grace's grandpa and basically the only family she's got.  Other surrogate family members are the other people who work with them at O'Reilly's Italian restaurant.  An Irish Italian restaurant is a running joke in the movie.  It's a place where you can get some nice pasta and marinara sauce, and corned beef and cabbage.....all on the same plate.  Robert Loggia plays Angelo, the Italian cook at the restaurant and I'm not sure whether or not he is actual family to Grace or not, that was a little unclear.
 However, Angelo and Marty, along with two other surly old codgers named Wally and Emmett are the players in some of the funniest scenes of the movie.  After closing time, they sit around playing cards, drinking beer and having arguments about practically anything.
 The first such argument is best dead male singer.  It quickly becomes a debate about which ethnic group has the most notable singers.  They are shouting names at each other: Bing Crosby, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Vic Damone, Frank Sinatra.  Then it becomes an argument about which singer beat up the most people.  It's a real gut buster, these guys are too funny.  Makes you wish you were a fly on the wall for every card game.
 Another funny storyline is the friendship Grace has with Megan (Bonnie Hunt) and Joe (James Belushi) who are the rattled parents of five kids, and portrayed, I'm here to say, in a manner somewhat mimicking what my own household might seem like.  Picking kids up off the floor, the yelling, the screaming, the occasional irrational exchanges all parents have with each other.  It's fun to laugh at that stuff happening to other people for once.  But, comparing apples to apples, this is the absolute best romantic comedy genre film I've seen in a very long time. Aside from some swearing, it is a G movie.  This one could have been made in the 1950s.  It is wholesome, sweet and a tad naive, just the things that make you forget some of the cynicism of the times we live in.  Return to Me forces you to take a simpler look at life, love and family.  How thankful you are to be alive, to have a heart beating in your chest.  How thankful you are for love, the love you have now, the love you had once, the love you have yet to know.  How thankful you are for family, both the family God gave you and the family members you chose for yourself in the friends that love you.",971222400,8,4606,4.5559610705596105

In this unfunny dud of a romantic comedy however there is nothing to keep the lovers apart, so they invent a totally silly hang-up for her and have him respond out of character when the 'big' secret of Minnie Driver is revealed. The only saving graces are Jim Belushi's belly and some Sinatra and Martin songs integrated in the plot. Duchovny and Driver generate as much excitement as drying paint.

Even though this whole heart thing is just an excuse to make a love story, it somehow does work. Maybe because of the gorgeousness and not least the natural behaviour of the two main actors. Minnie Driver is just sooo charming and nice, and David Duchovny is great as always (how come he always gets the good ones...).
The humor is very good as well, way above usual Hollywood level. A fine idea to throw in four elderly men with different ethnic backgrounds and an elderly woman to add some spice.

1108847,5,6306012400,"Let me say first before I begin, Hollywood should give David Duchovny a chance at a movie career.  He deserves it, and so what if ""Return to  Me"" didn't score but praise from critics all over the world.  Many  comparing his performance to Cary Grant.  Yes THE Cary Grant!  I hope  Hollywood opens it's eyes and see what else this man can do.  I have  faith... maybe too much but still... I have faith.
Well as for  ""Return to Me,"" alot of people missed out on this film and I'm  glad I was the few who DIDN'T miss it.  Everyone who worked on this was  X-cellent to the extreame.  No violence, no special effects, just wonderful  acting, an unbelieveably wonderful soundtrack (Sintra...yummy), a lack of  sex (thank you very much) and a delightful cast calls out for a great night  at the movies.
Is this movie predictable?  Yes.  Did I care? No, well  didn't care at all if the movie was predicatable.  I was too carried away  by the acting, characters, etc.  Everyone in this film is purely  delightful, Driver and Duchovny have the chemisty that I only dream film  actors would have.  They don't sizzle but there chemisty works hand in  hand, which is the opposite of Duchovny and Anderson which mixes and  matches.
Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan don't have chemisty as good and Duchovny  and Drive do.
I wished this film did better, but eventhough it didn't I  still love it.  It's a great film to sit around after a long week at school  or the office, at times I nearly fainted from laughing in my seat, bawling  my eyes out, or chocking on my popcorn (3 times) from laughing so hard.  The movie nearly killed me people.
""Return to Me"" is neither  cheesy or sappy (somewhat) but it works, oh and to make mention I love the  old Irish and Italian cronies at O'Rellys-they ROCKED and made the film 10  times more enjoyable.
Anyone who is anyone should take a look at this  film, Hollywood give Our Beloved David a chance at film (waiting to hear  more on ""Evolution"" David's next project), and Bonnie Hunt where  ever your are, and the cast and crew thank you for such a wonderful night  at the movies.

1108868,5,6306012400,"This movie has such a wonderful story - Bonnie Hunt's talent in writing and directing is tremendous.  It's been a long time since a movie so  romantic, funny and entertaining came along.
David Duchovny and Minnie  Driver were perfectly cast for the roles.  Duchovny really came shining  through as the central character.  He played the emotions perfectly.  It  was so sad to see him going through his mourning of the loss of his wife.  Duchovny showed great ""range"" in his acting skills (which he  doesn't get to ""show off"" on the X-Files show).  Minnie Driver  was so delicate and believable that you are just want for her to be  happy.
Bonnie Hunt, Belushi and the rest of the crew were so funny and  come across as people that you would like to meet and get to know. If you  are looking for a feel good movie and great entertainment, see this movie.",967766400,4,852,4.5131578947368425

This was the movie I took my current girlfriend to see on our first date,  so this film holds a bit of some sentimental value.  However, being a  Duchovny fan, it was nice to see him without a badge and gun for a change.  I thought he did rather well in a role originally meant for George Clooney.  Clooney would have been a bit more believable as an architect - Duchovny's  just too Ivy League.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, though.  The  relationship with Duchovny and Driver was plausible, as they exhibited  ample chemistry.  I was disappointed that they spent all the hair &  makeup budget on Minnie - Duchovny hardly had access to a comb for the  entire film.  I guess I'm just used to seeing him coiffed up in the  X-Files.  Anyway, it's a touching film with a great soundtrack.  Don't  hesitate to pick this one up!",967420800,2,904,4.435582822085889
1108870,5,6306012400,"Director and co-writer Bonnie Hunt delivers the goods in ""Return To Me,"" a touching story of two deserving people who are afforded a second chance at  love and happiness.  When we meet Grace (Minnie Driver), she is suffering  with heart disease and awaiting a donor for a transplant.  Architect-builder Bob Rueland (David Duchovny) is happily married to  Elizabeth (Joely Richardson), they are deeply in love, and Hunt quickly  establishes just how perfect their lives are together; so perfect, in fact,  it becomes somewhat unsettling because you know that tragedy of some kind  or other is imminent.  When it comes, the transition is handled succinctly  and with the skill of a seasoned professional.  When Elizabeth dies, Grace  receives her heart.  A year later, Bob, still mourning the loss of his  wife, meets Grace at the Irish-Italian restaurant owned by her grandfather  (Carroll O'Connor), where she works as a waitress.  Neither are aware of  the intimate link they share to the heart that has given Grace her life.  In the hands of a less savvy director, the story at this point could easily  go astray and become mired in coincidence and cliche.  Hunt never comes  close to allowing this to happen, however, and instead hits every note  squarely on the head so that the plot fairly resonates with precision and  timing.  A veteran character actress herself (she plays Grace's closest  friend, Meg, here), she seems to know instinctively just when to add the  right light touch to offset the drama, then fleshes it all out with an  array of great characters,especially Robert Loggia, as Angelo, the  ""Greatest Italian chef in Chicago,"" and James Belushi as Meg's husband,  Joe.  There are no wasted moments in this film; the story moves right along  and takes you with it.  The dialogue is often witty and always real; in a  scene between Grace and Meg that takes place in the hospital (prior to  their notification that a donor has been located), in which Grace can  barely draw a breath, she looks up at Meg and says one word, ""Rosebud.""  After Elizabeth dies, when Bob finds himself alone at home and finally  breaks down, Hunt gives the scene time to build and play out, so that it  rings true instead of being glossed over and simply used as a tool to move  the story along.  When it happens we, as an audience, are also afforded  that time to realize the suffering he's experiencing, and it allows us to  feel it as well.  The scene in which Grace, Meg and Joe are at home  awaiting a dinner guest (a former priest), is beyond hilarious.  Highlighting an exceptional cast, David Duchovny and Minnie Driver are  unforgettable as Bob and Grace; and the multi-talented Bonnie Hunt rises to  a whole new level of artistic merit for giving us a truly memorable and  heart-warming movie that is a joy to experience.  Written by Hunt and Don  Lake, ""Return To Me"" is a delight from beginning to end, the kind of film  one waits for to come along.  Hopefully, in the future Hunt will treat us  to even more movies of this caliber.",965779200,106,3040,4.735124760076776
1108871,5,6306012400,"This is a very wonderful and sensational movie.  I guess I went into the cinema thinking it would be quite average so I was pleasantly  surprised.
I have never been a huge X-Files person so I never realised  how great David Duchovny is.  Now I know he really is gorgeous and  loveable!  He'll make you cry for him.
Actually, every one in this film  was just so cool.  No-one annoyed me, which is so rare.  The family, which  included James Belushi as the Dad was soooo realistic - extremely chaotic,  which is what families are really like!  There were senior cits and  young'uns all hanging out together which is so fabulous. Oh I'm gushing  again aren't I?
It made me laugh a lot and cry a little bit too.  You  mostly cry in a bittersweet way if you're anything like me.

He follows her wishes  and donates her organs for transplant. The recipient is Minnie Driver's  character, spunky Grace Briggs, dying of heart disease far too young.  Caroll O'Connor plays her doting grandfather who raised her and Bonnie  Hunt, who wrote and directed the film, stars as Grace's best friend. Fate  plays a funny trick and Bob and Grace end up meeting. There's an immediate  spark between the two -- Duchovny and Driver do a wonderful job with this  without going over the top. It isn't until later that Bob and Grace find  out that she has his dead wife's heart. The chemistry between Duchovny and  Driver is terrific. The supporting cast is also excellent -- a real joy.
