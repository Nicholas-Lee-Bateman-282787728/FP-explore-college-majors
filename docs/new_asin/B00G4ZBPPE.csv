6060924,5,B00G4ZBPPE,"For Sully Erna's first run at acting, I thought he did a great job.  The story was a little messed up.  But that's probably why I liked it so much. I can't speak for everyone else, but I loved it.",1392422400,,196,3.875
6060925,5,B00G4ZBPPE,Sully did an amazing job on his film debut! This maybe a lower budget fin but it has the core of a great movie,1392336000,,110,3.625
6060926,5,B00G4ZBPPE,Army of the Damned had enough suspense to keep me on the edge of my seat. There's also comedic moments to give your emotions that unbalanced feeling. Tom Denucci's writing is superb.,1441843200,,182,4.71875
6060927,1,B00G4ZBPPE,"Terrible movie don't waste your money.
No complaint about seller.",1437955200,,65,5.6
6060928,5,B00G4ZBPPE,"I love Sully so of course I love the movie.  Some parts were funny and others had me saying ""Wwwwhhhhaaattt???"".",1424822400,,112,4.6
6060929,5,B00G4ZBPPE,"Army of the Damned isn't your typical shoot-em-up, zombie film. There is more to it than what is on the surface for most undead movies, this one has a great cast of characters and actors who bring it all to the table. With Godsmack front man, Sully Erna, as the film's lead it definitely takes it to the villains and blasts them straight to hell.",1400457600,,346,4.338461538461538
6060930,1,B00G4ZBPPE,"I'm a HUGE Sully Erna/Godsmack fan so I had to give it a shot. I'm so sorry Sully, this movie makes it on my all time worst list. I simply can't believe Sully wanted to do this. I'd like to think he was just bored. The acting was PATHETIC on all levels from the entire cast, and it makes me wonder if it was supposed to be more comedy than anything else. ""Comedy"" being the acting was the Mount Olympus of bad. The story was as you would expect, terrible. I respect Sully as a musician so I made myself watch the whole thing. I'm sorry I did.. it gave me gas.. VERY bad gas..",1399852800,2,575,4.008695652173913
6060931,5,B00G4ZBPPE,I so love my new movie. It has been added to my Sully Erna collection.  Was the best purchase of the year,1395619200,,105,3.772727272727273
6060932,2,B00G4ZBPPE,"Bought this for my girl for Valentine's. We waitied to watch this for a bad movie night and oh man it was bad. She said the best part was when they actually started playing Godsmack. The better part of acting in this film came from a side tattooed character that made the movie funnier.

Don't get me wrong, I love watching BAD films but I had a hard time even making fun of this film. It's like they were actually trying to make areal movie.",1395273600,,442,4.2
6060933,5,B00G4ZBPPE,"Even though it was lower budget, it was a great movie. Quite funny at times too. Sully Erna is the man!!!!",1395014400,,106,4.095238095238095
6060934,3,B00G4ZBPPE,Not going to win any Oscars but fun to watch Sully running around with a gun. Enjoyable and fun to watch,1393113600,,104,4.0
6060935,5,B00G4ZBPPE,"I love Sully Erna!  Great job Sully, cast and crew.  I love this movie!  Gather your friends and watch.  This movie has action and suspense.  Very entertaining.... Two thumbs up!",1392940800,,178,4.8
8620806,4,B00G4ZBPPE,Liked the Tony Todd casting.,1519689600,,28,4.8
8620807,4,B00G4ZBPPE,A gorgeous blond (with overbite) reporter and some hot police babes make for a pretty good and often funny horror flick.  I'm guessing they borrow the black eye thing from Supernatural.,1498780800,,185,4.967741935483871
8620808,5,B00G4ZBPPE,Rocken flick. Bad acting but look who's playing in it. Not bad for a first time film by sully erina. Loved the blood gutts. It kept me on edge of chair..two thumps up and another film I will be getting on blueray,1494720000,,212,4.071428571428571

8620811,5,B00G4ZBPPE,Anything with Thea Trinidad rates highly in my book!,1476230400,,52,4.888888888888889
8620812,4,B00G4ZBPPE,I thought this was a fairly good movie. It had a Tucker and Dale Vs Evil feel about it. A lot of blood and gore mixed with some comedy to keep you bouncing from laughter to omg that was disturbing.,1467244800,,197,3.95
8620813,3,B00G4ZBPPE,Disappointed acting not good weak story line.,1461628800,,45,5.571428571428571

8620815,1,B00G4ZBPPE,"Bad movie ,bad plot, bad acting. Couldn't make up it's mind if it was about demons or zombies. Don't know what the title alludes to but didn't see an army. Joey Fatone (""member him"") adds  some comic relief but not enough to save this bomb.",1453161600,,240,4.333333333333333
