REAL KUNG FU OF SHAOLIN is a mainland attempt to emulate the success of the Shaw Brothers studio, who were having a string of hits at the time given the popularity of the Venoms stars.  It's above routine, plenty of nondescript action if you like that sort of thing, but otherwise loads of of merit.",1524787200,,345,4.564516129032258
7928702,3,B0000507QS,"A story of a young boy saved from death and brought to Shaolin Temple in order to train in their kung fu to someday gain revenge on the one's guilty of killing his family.  When his martial arts training is finished he must pick the right time to make his move, and kill the man who stole his life away. Alright film, Some ok fights, shot on location at the real shaolin temple.  If your a collector it's a fine one to have but if not I don't recommend you go right out and get it.  It can wait.",991440000,,495,3.9797979797979797
