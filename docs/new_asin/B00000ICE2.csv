8493858,1,B00000ICE2,"You may like this video if you don't mind watching Gerry to teach physical  training to you more than full of the tape. Most of the swing technique  (actually not much) have been mentioned in most video or books. What's  worse, you can only watch him hit a ball and said ""Wooh, a nice and  long shot"" but how far is the ball....",961718400,3,328,4.158730158730159
8493859,5,B00000ICE2,"Gerry James has a simple powerful swing that makes you believe that with his advice you could duplicate it! I really enjoyed this video, it has all the elements you would expect for increasing your length off the tee.  Gerry's tips on increasing coil are a revelation and simple to understand.  His workout portion of the tape is clearly demonstrated and explained and  having started the program I feel my distance off the tee has increased. My  only minor complaint is I would like to see more of Gerry's swing with  different clubs and with different angles. Bottom line: a powerful video!",947635200,8,592,4.764705882352941
8493860,5,B00000ICE2,"Advanced power golf is a wonderful learning tool!...Gerry Jame's swing is technically perfect...his instruction is precise and easy to understand.  He emphasizes flexibility and strength training as an adjunct to hitting  the golf ball better and more powerfully. My handicap dropped from 8 to 4  in 2 months and I picked up 15 to 20 yds on my drives. I even won the NJ,  NY, DE qualifying for the RE/Max long drive, senior division. This video is  a must for golfers looking to build a correct, powerful, repeating swing.  And it's a must for anyone wanting to become maximally physically fit.",941155200,23,594,4.8316831683168315
