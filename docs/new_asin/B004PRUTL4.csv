8437776,3,B004PRUTL4,"This is not the best British puppetry that I have ever seen, but it is also far from the worst.

Comparing this to the American spoof film, Team America, or the short lived MTV series Super Action Team, makes sense. This is a film that is poking fun. However, this film does not break that fourth wall with puppet on strings jokes--particularly because these are not marionettes. Yet, this film is ""playing it straight.""  The tone of this movie is closer to that of Supermarionation films that exist as complete worlds unto themselves.

This alternate reality film is an interesting way to stage its own story as its own, unique universe of possibility.
Yet, not the best film ever. It is fun.",1470787200,,693,4.663934426229508
8437777,3,B004PRUTL4,"I failed to notice this is a movie done with dolls in stop motion animation. I had some amusing bits, but I think if I were English I might of enjoyed it more than I did. I got it because of the fantastic cast.",1424736000,,210,3.7954545454545454

8437780,5,B004PRUTL4,"This movie brought me back to the era of childrens marrianett style of programming but with a bit of adult but not crass humor, and rediculously entertaining. ""We shall neva' surrenda'!",1396828800,,185,5.0
8437781,3,B004PRUTL4,"""Never have so few . . .buggered it up . . . for so many . . ."" This weird little annimated feature--a first effort from brothers Ed and Rory McHenry of the UK--can't quite decide what it wants to be; a ""comedic"" alternate history of WWII in which Nazi Germany wins the Battle of Britain? A ""satiric"" mash-up of epic war movies and historical costume dramas? A tongue in cheek homage to the supermarionation of Gery Anderson and (by extension) Parker and Stone's ""Team America?"" Problem is, it simply doesn't work as any of those things. While some of the miniatures are impressive (1/6 scale puppets and radio-controlled models with elaborate hand-built backdrops, minimal CGI and no green screen), the jokes tend to fall flat, and, in some cases, meander into the mildly insulting. The language is definitely not family-friendly, but there's not much to engage adults either. I was expecting something along the lines of ""Valiant;"" which, granted isn't expecting much, but came away sadly unentertained. Disappointing, especially considering how much work went into the production; the torturously extensive and overly self-congratulatory special features on this DVD take up more time than the film itself. My advice; skip it.",1342656000,,1229,5.119402985074627
8437782,4,B004PRUTL4,"I thought this movie would have live actors, but instead it had puppets.  After a while the puppets began to look almost real except for the female characters who all looked like Barbie dolls.

8437783,2,B004PRUTL4,"Judge Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict-- The basic joke of Jackboots on Whitehall is that it takes a lot of familiar war movie scenes, emphasizes the conventional elements of those scenes, and cranks them up to full volume. It's amusing on occasion, but without much wit in the screenplay the format becomes tiresome. The revisionism is certainly strange (aside from the fact that Churchill and some Scottish farmers didn't win the war all by themselves, the film turns Hitler into a cross-dresser and transforms the Hindenburg into a Nazi warship), but it's rarely quite nutty enough to transcend the feeling that this whole thing is an overlong, ill-considered Robot Chicken sketch (a feeling particularly amplified when Braveheart turns up to make a bunch of Mel Gibson jokes).

The vocal work is...intriguing. The film boasts an all-star cast, but you'll recognize very few of the voices. Tom Wilkinson does a very strange German accent, Timothy Spall reprises his hilariously odd Winston Churchill impression from The King's Speech, Stephen Merchant plays a gruff old man, Dominic West talks like Bender from Futurama, and Alan Cumming's campy Hitler is...well, a campy Hitler. The effect is hit-and-miss, as many lines of dialogue are lost in the midst of the loopy accents and shrieking line deliveries.

The DVD transfer is rather impressive, offering excellent detail (though it's rather apparent that the models being used are about as detailed and flexible as Barbie dolls) and deep, inky blacks. Audio is also quite strong, with the booming score (which not only riffs on Goodwin but also on Hans Zimmer and James Horner) frequently serving as the funniest, most involving element. Extras include some behind-the-scenes footage, interviews with creators Edward and Rory McHenry and a handful of very brief featurettes: ""The Swastikas,"" ""Bad Day to Be a Nazi,"" ""Hitler's Rat Pack,"" ""The Nazi Hotties,"" ""Explosions,"" and ""Voiceovers."" All of the features are presented in rather awful video quality.

Jackboots on Whitehall is a unique experience, but that's about the only thing it has going for it. It pays loving homage to and mockingly parodies a lot of '60s war flicks in a manner that is impressive on paper but a little tiresome to actually sit through. Then again, if you're the sort of person who finds The Battle of Britain riveting viewing, you may find this a comic delight. For this reviewer, it ranks right next to Valiant as a peculiar, unsuccessful piece of WWII-themed animation.

8437784,3,B004PRUTL4,"Jackboots on Whitehall is one of those idea's that falls under the age old saying ""Would've, Could've Should've, Didn't.""  This movie had so many funny idea's that were mismanaged and thrown together so haphazardly that the end result is discombobulating.

The story is an alternative history setting, revolving around two points of departure.  The failure of the BEF to evacuate Dunkirk, and the Battle of Britain ending in triumph for the Luftwaffe.  Although the story revolves around a number of different characters, the plot is centred on and driven by Chris, an orphaned farmer from Kent with unusually large hands.  After the Wehrmacht invade England by tunnelling under the channel, it's up to Chris and his rag-tag bag of friends to save the day.

Many of the characters are stereotypical, but the movie dose this on purpose for laughs, and at certain points in the movie it successfully pulls it off.  But sadly the majority of the times it doesn't, leaving the movie looking quite dumb.  The other major problem with the movie is that is tries to be funny by deliberately being stupid.  Unfortunately it succeeds in being too stupid resulting in scenes that are meant to draw laughs looking childishly goofy.

Still, for all it's faults the battle scenes are intense and a spectacle to watch, and there are moments where you can't help but laugh at what some of the characters say.  Himmler calling Churchill ""Fat Boy,"" Churchill's many one liners he snarls over the cause of the movie.  Hitler calling Himmler ""Himmy-himmy-Himmler,"" and Billy Fisk's stead-fast belief he's fighting Communists.  A good watch and a good laugh at times.",1307145600,,1647,4.989010989010989
