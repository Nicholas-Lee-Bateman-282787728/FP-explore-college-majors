8216175,4,B000V1KAGM,"Interesting documentary on women in the legal system in Cameroon -
prosecutors and judges - and how they're slowly making progress dealing
with the overwhelmingly male- centric society and laws.

It's impossible not to be touched watching them deal with cases of
child rape, spousal abuse, child neglect, etc. And they do so with
wisdom, dignity, and sometimes humor.

We also see their more human sides, in moments dealing with the
children who come to them in trouble, as well as with their own
children.

My problems were that there was a feeling that everyone knew they were
onstage. The presence of camera feels like it's palpably changing
behavior on all sides. Also, it feels - true or not - like we're not
getting the whole story on some of these cases. It feels like there is
tremendous selectivity going on to present these women as almost
infallible heroes.

I also can't help being disturbed by Cameroon's justice system, which
leaves the finding of guilt or innocence totally up to the judge, and
based on what we see here, often there is scant evidence on either
side, just a 'he said, she said'.

That may be the best a country like Cameroon can do. The money for
things like real forensics is a million miles away. But it still makes
the film's unabashed, unquestioning admiration of these clearly
terrific women feel a bit glossy.

Non-the-less, I still quite enjoyed it, felt excited by the change
these women represent, and was glad to be let into a world I'd
otherwise know nothing about.",1312243200,,1508,4.736641221374046
8216176,5,B000V1KAGM,"A documentary with English subtitles, Sisters in Law provides a fascinating look into the legal world of a Cameroon village.  It's a soap opera from the beginning.  Within the first 10 minutes, we meet a woman who was sold into a marriage she did not want by her father, who is then taken to task by prosecutor Ngassa.  The inner workings of a foreign court system are fascinating to those interested in cultures other than their own.  However, not everyone finds this documentary interesting.  The most common complaint I have heard is that there is too many unanswered questions and not enough closure.  What happens to the plaintiffs 6 months later?  Where did the prosecutor and judge come from?  How did they get into the field and what drives them?

The documentary is in a ""fly-on-the-wall"" style, with no voice-overs or explanations.  It is 100% these people and their lives.  Some find this interesting, others find it boring.  I find it fascinating.",1205366400,3,959,4.851851851851852
