8319246,5,B001LNX7YQ,"I am glad to have these 2 classic sci-fi thrillers in my collection.  The Predator was Arnold in his prime and a treat to watch.  Alien never gets old and is still a great movie, even with its older technology.",1359331200,,210,4.225
8319247,4,B001LNX7YQ,"I love double feature DVD's.  They may not have all of the extras but they are definitely worth the price.  As far as the movies go, well, that's a no brainer...I mean it's Alien and Predator in one set.  How can you go wrong.  My only complaint (and it is worth one star) is that Predator is the full screen version, not wide screen. Oh well, still a good purchase.",1282953600,,366,4.185714285714286
