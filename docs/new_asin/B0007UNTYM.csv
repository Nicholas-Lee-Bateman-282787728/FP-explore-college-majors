8051846,4,B0007UNTYM,"Code of the Cactus, 1939 film

It starts with cattle feeding in a valley. A truck arrives with two men in the cab and two riders with horses in the trailer. Using trucks to steal cattle is the modern method. A guard fires shots to warns and call the others. Four riders shoot at the truck but they cant catch up. A new cowboy suggests a telephone call to the Sheriff. Can Lightning Carson help? The US Army has bidding on cattle, one man puts in a low bid. How can he deliver at that price? The Sheriff stops a truck to inspect its cattle; they're all branded 87. [Are racketeers from the Big City moving into the country?] Will they put the small ranchers out of business? Is that foreman in cahoots with the crooks? A Mexican rides up and asks for a job; his name is Miguel. Can he sing or dance? He can handle a pistol!

Miguel meets two men in a truck and tells them to walk. Another hijack by Miguel? Theyve got to stop him. Can three men stop him? No. Thurston talks to Miguel. Where did you hide the cattle? There is a deal. They need 500 head of cattle. They have to be on the lookout for Lightning Carson now. Miguel tells the ranch foreman what he learned. He suspects a leak from the S1 ranch. That Range Detective is shot and captured. That night the gang rides to the south pasture. Those ranchers prepare an ambush. Its a trap! Beat it! But they learn about Miguel. They hold a mock trial. Theres only one thing to do says Miguel. There is a fight in the dark, Miguel escapes with the Bob.  The next morning trucks haul cattle and avoid the rustlers. There is a shoot-out. More good guys arrive to stop the rustlers. Carson follows Blackton. Carson will return to the city for peace and quiet. But they can send him a wire if needed.

This is an interesting plot even if it is about average overall. Are fast-moving trucks used in modern rustling? War-time rationing would create new opportunities for cattle rustling, but, gasoline rationing tended to decrease this activity. Tim McCoy shows his character as a person.",1405555200,,2033,4.384615384615385

8051848,5,B0007UNTYM,"I'll admit that I'm a sucker for the old classic westerns and t his one is no exception. In t his case it's cattle rustling that drives the plot and brings the guns out so the White Hats and blow away The Black Hats, but overall it's just a great example of a fun, old school, studio western - without all of the editing you get when they show these films on television. I was very impressed by the quality of the disk and the video transfer.",1147996800,,442,4.091954022988506
