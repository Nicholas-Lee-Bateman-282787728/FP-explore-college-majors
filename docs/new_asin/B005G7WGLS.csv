4689954,5,B005G7WGLS,Over the last few years there have been alot of REALLY BAD remakes of retro cartoons but Thundercats is definitely not one of them. In fact I enjoyed this more than the original show. The writing is mature and the animation is feature film quality. I haven't missed a single episode so far and I will proudly add this DVD to my collection.,1316822400,3,339,4.396825396825397
4689955,5,B005G7WGLS,"This show is extremely well done. Lets pretend there was no original series for a moment. On its own this is an awesome fantasy. The world is very detailed and the animation is fluid. The voice acting is spot on and each character maintains their own personality. Unavoidable cliches aside; this is how modern cartoons should be made. The color scheme is vibrant and pays homage to the 80s(neon pinks,blues,greens,etc). It borrows just enough from anime without ripping anything off directly and adds a nice fresh feel to it. In a slew of mediocre cartoons this is a welcomed surprise.",1316217600,39,585,4.86
4689956,4,B005G7WGLS,"Pre release. We can see that this disc has no extra features. But packs the first eight episodes on two discs.
Which at the current Amazon listing price of 13.99 is about 1.75 a episode.  The Animation and voice work for this series is really top notch. Its a very different third Earth from the Original Series, and yet stronger because of the clear fans of the original universe tweaking it in homage.",1315872000,14,403,4.52054794520548
4689957,5,B005G7WGLS,OK first off I just want to say I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE the new Thundercats!! To Be Honest I like this Thundercats so much better than the original 1984 one. I like the design of the characters a whole lot better. I have no problem with this reboot of Thundercats! I cannot wait for this to come out in October!!!I have not missed one single episode since this has aired. I reccomend this to anybody!!,1314057600,2,405,4.342105263157895
4689958,5,B005G7WGLS,"I've watched Thundercats since I was very little and when I heard that there was to be an remake lets just say life could not get any better. For those who have not watched the origional not to worry as this series pretty much does not follow the origional story and (which I like) they created there own stories useing the origional main thundercats like Lion-o, Tigra, Cheetara, Panthro (only shows up episode 4) Wily Kit and Wily Kat. If you are quick you will also see Linx-o, who is a season 2 charactor from the origional series, on pilot episode and don't ask me why they put a blind man/cat in their watchtower as I found that to be extremely funny.

For the new viewers this is a great quality animation series and interesting charactors on an alien world with plenty of fight sequences perfect for any sci fi fan. For the old guys out there who swear by the origional give this a try as they have brought out all the fan favourite charactors with there backgrounds stories and even sporting the voice actor of the origional Lion-o now playing his father the king.

This is one series I will be getting and so should you.",1313971200,5,1130,4.427884615384615
4689959,4,B005G7WGLS,I although don't relay like the new Thundercats show as I prefer the old show but this version is an super reboot for the kids of today. I hope to Blu-ray some day of the old cartoon.,1313884800,,183,3.972972972972973
4689960,3,B005G7WGLS,"I love the new Thundercats show, as the anime is top notch quality that matches the quality in Young Justice.  I think the anime quality is so good that the new Thundercats show deserves a Blu-ray release.

I like the how the concept and characters have been redone.  I think the voice casting is excellent, where the characters actually talk normally instead of the staggered talk of the original show.  I don't want to say anything more about the new Thundercats show, as I don't want to give away any spoilers.

Once again, however, why are there no DVD extras?!?  Why would I want to buy the DVD, as the episodes can be bought as digital downloads from the WB Store?",1312761600,3,670,4.4958677685950414

4689965,5,B005G7WGLS,"I just recently received this from Amazon and I must admit it is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!! This version is so much better than the original. I've only watched the first three episodes, so far, but this version is OBVIOUSLY created for adults and children alike. The original version was OBVIOUSLY created just for children. I'd say that this version was born of the interest of adults in animation comedies like The Simpsons. The babyboomer crowd grew up with the original Thundercats and it was obviously surmised that THEY would especially appreciate seeing the full potential of what the Thundercats could be if properly done right.

Of course, I have only seen a couple of episodes, but I sense, from the reviews, that I will not be disappointed by the rest of the episodes. The original Thundercats was okay when I was a kid. I like this version best! I'm going to try to find Book 2, of this series, right after I write this review. As an Amazon Prime member this cost, what, a little over seven bucks with shipping? Geeze, what a steal!!!

This reminds me of my surprise when I bought the newer version of Masters of the Universe. I am impressed by that version for the very same reasons.",1432425600,,1192,4.644549763033176

4689973,4,B005G7WGLS,"Let's get something out of the way--I preferred the original Thundercats series to this remake, overall.  Having said that, this remake of the Thundercats could've coalesced into something special if it had at least a full 18-24 episodes to develop.  On the plus side, I do enjoy that Mum-Ra was originally an intergalactic warlord/conqueror (much like Darth Vader/Emperor Palpatine from Star Wars) who was originally defeated & deposed by Lion-O's ancestor and that Thundera was a kingdom on Earth.  I also enjoyed the attempt at world-building and the fleshing out of Lion-O's father and Grune.  As I said, what hurt this series is the fact that it was cancelled so early into its existence.  Still, I'm glad that I was able to purchase it at a low price and that it won't go into total obscurity.  Still, if you are old enough to remember the original series, I still recommend purchasing those if you want the true Thundercats experience.

By the way, I just found out that there are 2 more volumes (or Books) in this series.  I'll probably be purchasing those in the not-too-distant future if all goes well.  I still say that Warner Brothers yanked it too soon.  I would've liked to have seen Warner fully resolve the Thundercats storyline before ending the series.",1416268800,,1270,4.837962962962963

4689982,5,B005G7WGLS,"This is the first disc of 3 of Cartoon Network's updated version of the Thundercats!

The series is a fresh look at a classic from my childhood. There is an all-new cast of voices, and some shifting in attitudes/personalities, but no one who liked the original will have any difficulty adjusting to the new crew.

All of the great aspects of the original are still present in the new Thundercats universe, and the new series addresses some of the aspects of the first series that were often overlooked or ignored. We see the 'Cats at their prime, as the ruling class on a planet of many species. We learn about some of their distant history, and get more details about certain early events that impact the entire run of episodes.

I don't want to be the spoiler for anyone, so I'll just say that if you're a fan of Thundercats, you should get this series. Introduce a new generation to the cool cartoons from our time!",1387843200,,918,4.518072289156627
4689983,5,B005G7WGLS,Great gift for my nephews.  This is a great cartoon.  I still cannot believe Cartoon Network cancelled this.

4689999,5,B005G7WGLS,"I was really used to watching the old Thundercats that used to come on television when I was younger.  I used to watch them all day, and when I got older, I finally bought the entire box set of the old series.  I was really happy to receive the DVD series because I liked it so much.  When I heard about the new Thundercats coming on television, I have to admit that I was really skeptical at watching or even buying the series because it looked so different compared to the old series.  I even heard that most of the show had changed compared to the older version which was something that I did not want to hear at the time and that prevented me from watching the show for a while.  But eventually, my curiosity got the better of me and I finally watched the first episode of the new Thundercats when it was on television one day.  To my surprise, I was actually impressed with how this new Thundercats was presented on this show.  Sure the characters in this version are younger and portrayed as more childish than in the older version, but the other aspects in this show makes you forget about that fact by watching a lot of the cool action scenes and great voice overs for the series.  Also, Snarf does not get to talk at all in this series which I heard a lot of people actually liked about this version.  But honestly, I kind of missed hearing one of my favorite characters talking through the show.  But even though Snarf does not get to talk anymore, he still is pretty funny in this series so I guess I can get used to it.  Basically, you should defiantly give this show a try if you are skeptical of watching it.  Even if you are new to the Thundercats series, this show is defiantly something to watch for any reason you can think of.",1354060800,,1745,4.270516717325228

4690001,2,B005G7WGLS,"The 2011 reboot of Thundercats had so much potential but that potential ended up being wasted at every opportunity. While the animation was great, the writing, direction, plot, and character development suffered throughout the series. Then there was the inclusion of an idiotic Twilight love triangle that served to further splinter the fanbase instead of uniting it.

As episodes progressed, the reboot felt less and less like Thundercats and more like a jumbled mess of pop culture references crammed together in a third-graders attempt at fan fiction. Instead of Thundercats, fans got: Star Wars, Dark Crystal, Neverending Story, Final Fantasy, Halo, Hellboy, Toho Studios, Pokemon, Digimon, Moby Dick, and Oliver Twist to name but a small portion of the unoriginality.

Lion-O, the main protagonist from the 1980's hit series, has been reduced to a bootheel character to promote the superiority of the new star of the series - Tygra. Honestly, by the time the series wrapped, I was left wondering why it was even being called Thundercats and not ""The Adventures of Tygra and the Tygracats.""
The tigers statement in the pilot that Lion-O would always be second best to him in all things was driven home in practically every episode and in the end, it cost the series a lot of its fanbase.

Like Lion-O, Cheetara's character suffered greatly during the run of this bad fan fiction. She started out with so much potential then had that potential pulled away when she was romantically paired with Tygra whos character didn't mesh well with hers at all. Her role as a Cleric was taken away and she became nothing more than a bobble-headed background cheerleader for the xenophobic and racist Tygra. This choice marked a first in animation; it created a Moonlighting Effect and aided in bringing down the show.

Tygra was obviously the creative teams favorite from the get-go and it showed. He was made a Gary-Stu character who was an expert at everything (he is clueless about technology but is a master marksman with a laser pistol AND a sniper rifle not to mention is a Flying Ace capable of flying ANY craft without any knowledge or training because his ancestors who lived hundreds upon hundreds of years ago were pilots....) that could ""do no wrong"" and when he did do wrong - which was often - he came through without suffering a single consequence for his actions. Heck, he tries to kill Lion-O twice in the series and is rewarded for it by being paired with Cheetara - go figure that one out because most fans are still wondering about it....

All in all, Thundercats ended up being a handful of alright episodes with a majority of WTF episodes. Frankly, after episode 13, most of the episodes for Thundercats were filler and did nothing to advance the overall plot.

There was potential for this series but like that POS Thundercats comics Wildstorm/DC passed off in early the 2000's, the end result was a subpar product that failed more than it succeeded.
Maybe the TC Crew shouldn't have relied on the failed comics as much as they did. Maybe the TC Crew should have aimed to give Thundercats to viewers and not Star Wars with feline characters.

Sadly, given the abject failure that was 2011 Thundercats, fans might have to wait another 20+ years before another attempt is made and that might be too long a wait.",1349049600,,3323,4.829525483304042
4690002,5,B005G7WGLS,"I don't care for remakes/reboots, but new Thundercats was a nice surprise as it stayed close to the mythology of the original while taking the series in a different direction. Omens Part One and Two shows Thundera on an epic scale. The evil Mumm-Ra and his army attack the city. The Lord of the Thundercats is killed in the battle leaving his son Lion-O the Sword of Omens.

Lion-O goes on a quest to find the Book of Omens along with his older brother Tygra, the fast running Cheetara, the little thieves Wilykit and Wilykat, his pet Snarf, and elder warrior Panthro.

The series is well-written and the animation is better than any other cartoon on TV today. The only downside about the Season One Book One DVD is that there are only eight episodes. For a remake, Thundercats has a great start to become a classic.",1339372800,,816,4.54421768707483
4690003,4,B005G7WGLS,"Thundercats: Season 1 Book 1 consists of the first 8 episodes of the 2011 Thundercats reboot which airs on Cartoon Network. It's unfortunate that there's not a Blu Ray or a season set, but that's just how WB seems to do things. I will be rather pissed if they release a season set after I buy all of the individual volumes, but I'm not holding my breath waiting for a Blu Ray. Well, on to the show.
It's awesome. It manages to retain a lot of elements from the original show from the 80's while bringing them up to modern artistic and storytelling standards. Let's face it, cartoons have come a long way since the 1980's, and this is no exception. In fact, it's one of the best cartoons on TV at the moment. Notice I say ONE OF--I'm afraid the top spot has to go to The Legend of Korra, the sequel series to Avatar: the Last Airbender, which is a show that has pretty clearly influenced this one. The feel of a Japanese-influenced fantasy adventure where the main characters wander around encountering lots of strange creatures obviously has been lifted from Avatar. Even the DVD--labeled ""Book 1""--shows the love the creators obviously had for Avatar. This is, however, by no means a bad thing! Both shows are excellent, and it just means that we have more quality programming on our hands, and I love that it doesn't talk down because it's ""intended for children"". Kids love this kind of thing--I know I did! And I still do.
If I had any complaint it's that the show has a very strong season premiere but then very quickly loses momentum. This actually makes viewing it on DVD ideal; you can watch all of the episodes one after another rather than waiting a week for it to air on TV, making the loss of storytelling ""oomph"" less noticeable. Furthermore, a lot of the concepts seem a little uneven. I really like the idea of mixing swords and sorcery and far-out sci fi space opera but when you think about it it feels like everything's kind of thrown together. It's a show about cat people in a magical world--but there are also lizard people with giant robots and a mummy from space. It's a very, very minor complaint--one that no doubt is a result of it being a reboot of the significantly more uneven 80's show--but it's a complaint nonetheless. While watching you hardly notice it and only when you sit back and consider the series does the sheer oddity of it set in. The show itself does a very good job at making you suspend disbelief.
Standout episodes include the two-part series premiere and ""Legacy"", in which Lion-O learns of the (rather sci-fi) origin of the Thundercats. Is it weird that I want more episodes to take place in the past where the show resembles a crazy space opera? I don't think it's weird. Let's see more of that, Warners!
All in all, a very good set of episodes from a great show. The high production values and smart writing should impress anyone. If you think it's worth the wait, maybe some might want to hold out and see if there's a season set which collects all 26 episodes instead of 8 episodes a pop. It will probably be a while, though, since the individual volumes are spaced out quite a bit (as of writing it's June 2012 and the second volume out of three has only JUST NOW been released, as season 2 is airing on TV). Highly recommended.",1339027200,,3282,4.480801335559265

4690005,5,B005G7WGLS,"I'll admit, when the original Thundercats was released back in the '80's, I was too old for the series. I was in 7th grade at the time, and I was pretty much through watching any cartoon series that didn't have some sort of draw for an older audience - whether it be through humor or more mature story-telling. I thought the original concept was decent, but I didn't care for the ""big boss"" bad guy Mum-ra or his goofy lizard- and frog-like underlings, or for the infinitely annoying Snarf character. In this modern update, however, nearly everything I disliked about the original series has been modified and updated in such a way as to make it more interesting, more palatable, and more fun. I have kids of my own, now, and I have watched every episode of this new series with them. They really like it, and I have to say that it is a big improvement over the original. In every way - from scripting, dialogue, story themes, animation and effects, andartistic design - everything is better, and I didn't mind watching it with them. This is a great modern fantasy series that your kids will be sure to love. Probably th ebest re-boot of an animation series that I have ever seen.",1335657600,,1180,4.518691588785047

Not unlike Cartoon Networks awesome 2002 Masters of the Universe reboot, I grew up watching the original show way back in the 80's too so it's great to see this franchise reimagined properly. There's eight mighty episodes on this first volume that show's off the rich universe of the Thundercats. I feel the only downside is that there are no special features but the price tag is a steal here on Amazon so you can't go wrong.

It's intense, comedic and a show that does do the classic series justice. I highly recommend this series for your preteens & teens.

For example there is a moment where Mumm-ra is shown torturing Jaga for information about the location of the Book of Omens. I hope this review helps!:D",1324771200,,553,4.475247524752476

  We start the story with Third Earth the world in which the Thundercats lead by Claudis and current lord of the Thundercats. Along with his sons Lion-o and adoptive son Tygra he rules and all is well within the kingdom. However Lion-o future lord desries to learn of the ancient technology that litters third earth and of the legends of Mumm-ra the ever living. However his brother Tygra think Lion-o head is in the clouds and thinks he should focous on his duties that he will inherit one  day like becoming the bearer of the sword of omens. A balde fashonied in the early days to tame the lands of Third Earth.  Meanwhile two orphan cubs Willy Kit and Willy Kat are stealing food and coins to surivive on the streets of the city. A chance encounter by Lion-o meets Cheetra cleric in service to the lord of the thundercats and the order responable to ensure the sword goes to the next in line.
  Claudis fears that Lion-o is not ready and thinks he never will be ready. With Lion-o showing mercy to two lizard men whose crime was stealing food for thier children. All this and famed general Grune has returned after years of traveling the wolrd in hopes to find the favled ""Book of Omens"" a book that the clerics belive will show the thundercats the history of its race.

  Can what remains  of the Thundercats stop Grune, Mumm-ra and find the book of Omens. A book thought by Grune and his friend Pantro thought to be lost were sent to find years ago? You'll have to check this out in the all new Thundercats.",1321833600,,2197,4.435323383084577
4690013,4,B005G7WGLS,"Thundercats (2011) is a reboot of the popular 80's cartoon series of the same name.  Many of the characters and core elements of the original show have been preserved in this new version, but cleverly re-imagined to keep the story fresh and exciting.  The animation quality ranks among the best of cartoons produced today and is supported by superb voice acting and clever script writing.  The producers have also inserted several ""easter eggs"" throughout the episodes that fans of the original show will appreciate.

The DVD itself seems to be somewhat hastily put together.  It features eight episodes from season one, but no special features.  I suspect a larger, complete volume set is slated for eventual release, but for now, at such a low price (~$15), it's a great deal and well worth the purchase.",1321660800,,806,4.933333333333334
4690014,4,B005G7WGLS,"Not that THUNDERCATS required a reboot, but here it is anyway, and it turns out to be the good sauce. This new version reimagines the characters some but, with the exception of Tygra, the relationship dynamics are pretty familiar. On Third Earth, the Kingdom of Thundera is regarded as the most powerful and the most fecund, this realm lorded over by the mighty Thundercats, to the envy of the other sentient beasts who must resort to fighting over scraps. ""Ruling with a just heart and razor claw..."" Such is the hubris of the cats that they're caught ill-prepared when the Lizard army invades, bringing to bear its salvaged hi-tech weaponry and a deep-seated coveting for what the cats have. In this battle, the Thunderan King, Claudus, falls and his unprepared heir, Lion-O, must take up the crown. Even though everyone believes that Lion-O's older, stronger, more clever brother, Tygra, is more suited to rule. The only hope now lies in unearthing the long lost mystical Book of Omens. Can the unproven new lord lead the few remaining Thundercats on a quest across perilous uncharted lands, with the frightful Mumm-Ra the Ever-Living, conjurer of foul ancient sorcery, and his bestial minions only whiskers away in pursuit?

And that is the set-up for this revamping.

First off, as someone who'd always found the original Snarf so vexing, I'm ecstatic that this new Snarf is rendered without speech. And I love the visual design on the new Wilykit and Wilykat and happy to see that they remain the same mercurial young tricksters. The early episodes take great pains to reintroduce each of the cast and how he or she fits into the new dynamics. Several of the core characters meet each other for the first time. Wilykat and Wilykit are street savvy urchins out to merrily grift their way thru life, that is, until the Thunderan Empire falls. They quickly latch onto Lion-O and his entourage. Cheetara, super-speed and staff in hand, pulls Lion-O's fat out of the fire and you can't blame Lion-O for harboring an instant crush. Panthro we don't meet until the closing moments of the fourth episode, and he's an older and more hard-bitten warrior than what we're used to. Lion-O's old wise adviser Jaga starts out with a more active role. And Tygra, we already know. Tygra is also this smug jerk at times. Episodes frequently touch on his and Lion-O's ongoing sibling rivalry and how Tygra seems to be juuuust that smidge superior to Lion-O.

THUNDERCATS SEASON ONE, BOOK ONE is obviously not the entire season of this reboot, but it does contain the first eight episodes, and I won't dis that. Narrative continuity is well served here as half the episodes included deal directly with constructing the Thundercats mythos. The two-part debut, ""Omens,"" establishes Thundera and its eventual demise as a kingdom and Lion-O's ascension to the throne. ""Old Friends,"" as seen mostly thru Panthro's eyes, recounts his rise in rank from grunt to trusted officer in King Claudus's army. ""Journey to the Tower of Omens"" finds Lion-O and his party finally locating the Book of Omens except that they must successfully navigate a series of death traps to get to it. In ""Legacy"" the Book of Omens entraps Lion-O into experiencing Thundera's very early days.

But those don't fall into my two most favorite episodes in this collection. Instead it's the surprisingly emotional ""Song of the Petalars,"" in which our travelers befriend tiny plant pixies on their pilgrimage home and whose ephemeral lives span the breadth of one day. And ""The Duelist and the Drifter,"" in which Lion-O while seeking supplies wanders into a bladesman's town where everyone engages in sword duels. The titular characters in this episode are pretty awesome, especially the (literally) Drifter. Meanwhile, ""Ramlak Rising"" offers the irony of fish-men crewing a ship navigating thru a sea of sand, fish-men with a craving for tasty Thundercat flesh.

I would never say that the 1980s series wasn't imaginative. It was very imaginative; it presented a compelling overarching story. Except that those individual episodes sometimes came off as very shallow stuff, written perfunctorily. This new series applies a richer, more latticed form of storytelling. It injects more depth and more character work. It feels more nuanced. The animation is tight with a clear anime influence, and they've stepped up the action sequences. The only thing I'm missing, really, is the ridiculously catchy original theme song. And, sorry, I still prefer how the original Cheetara looked. If I were to do a Top Five of sexiest animated female characters, Cheetara would easily make it. And if you're jonesing for Lion-O's awesome battle cry as he channels the Sword of Omens - ""Thunder... Thunder... Thundercats! Ho!"" - rest assured, bro, that's still there, even if the delivery's a bit different.

This two-disc DVD set coughs up a hairball with its absolute lack of bonus features. That's not exactly demonstrating sight beyond sight.",1320278400,8,4978,5.020581113801453
4690015,5,B005G7WGLS,"Ok kids, and big kids, this is it ! The original TC series was drawn very well, though characters were a little on the flamey side.  nothing wrong with that, just sayin  This new version is NOT disappointing at all. It's awesome. I'm proud of the people that went on to preserve this awesome story. I'm 32 yrs old, and this is one of the best remade cartoons from old school cartooning I've ever seen. If you get stoned, and still enjoy watching cartoons, this is the cartoon for you. I swear it was like they tried to mimic Lord of The Rings in some parts of it.  which is even cooler  In my opinion you will not be let down with this product, and if anything you'll re-experience the love for Thundera like never before. Thundercats HO !!! Cheetara..... I ... I love you....xoxo beastiality never looked so good until now !",1320192000,,825,4.372549019607843
4690016,5,B005G7WGLS,"Now to the reason. It isn't so much a go over of the original version it is a remake of the original. In Legacy you see that in the time before Third Earth the Thundercats were Mumm-Ra's brute squad. Mumm-Ra had a massive starship filled with humanoid slaves combing the galaxy for gems of power and the Thundercats were the overlords. All of the gems were powerful in their own right but of course the Eye was more than a match for two that they had already collected (Leo the predisessor to Lion-o had already dislodged the third they had collected at the start of the fight when the slaves lead by Leo and his girlfriend rebeled). In the end just as they were celebrating a magnetic storm started around Third Earth and caused the ship to crash. Jump to Omens Part one, Lion-o is a young prince that still believes in all that ""NONSENCE"" that all kittens are told at bedtime of ships that sailed through the sky and other such flights of fantasy known as ""technology"". This is also the part where Lion-o meets Cheetara (Who is a LOT hotter than she had been in the original!) and she learns that he's got connections in the Thundarian underworld that supplies him with said mythology. (Thundera is a kingdom on Third Earth which is ruled by Claudus, Lion-o and adopted brother Tygra's father, who is a rule by the swing of a Sword of Omens and thrust of a spearhead and rain of arrows type guy. As he sees things there is no need for complex thought or justice when dealing with other than cats). Jaga who is a Archmage rather than a swordsman in this series is still the wise and venerable old wiseman that ALL listen, leads the Royal Clerics. (While the normal Thundercat is no weakling, the clerics are a class unto themselves). While Jaga advises Claudus, Tygra and Lion-o, he also has his work cut out for him keeping Lion-o's spirits up and believing in the existance of technology since Claudus and Tygra always ride him hard for believing in such nonsence and believing in the rule of Honor and Integraty for all animals. One other thing I love about this remake, Snarf who hangs around Lion-o, does NOT say one blasted thing!! God how I have ALWAYS have hated that 'Snarf Snarf' thing!! Makes me wish I could reach into the TV and strangle that dragon/cat composit, this one doesn't say a thing. Of course he doesn't have to to make himself be understood. The kittens Willykit and Willykat (who are so cure and adorable in this series) are orphans doing what they have to do to survive in the streets, all the while dreaming of the time when they could finally be able to leave Thundera and search out city of treasure so they will be rich enough that OTHERS would have to beg THEM for money. You DO see Lynxo in Omens part two in a watch tower. Sorry, GENERAL Lynxo. Ehh, If you can handle the job as far as I'm conserned. Anyway, you see him announcing the arrival of Slithe's lizard amy bent on the destruction of Thundera. In the end Thundera falls to Slithe because of the betrale of Grune and the trickory of Mumm-Ra, who had been freed from his imprisnment by Grune. Grune being one of the two warriors, Pantho being the other that Claudus had sent many years before to search for the Book of Omens that the Clerics had hidden centures before to keep the knowledge that it contained out of the reach of the other animals. Before the end of Omens Part Two you see Jaga fall at Grune's hands, while Claudus falls at Mumm-Ra's and Thundera turned to rubble. All but the last of this eight episode collection is the to find the Book of Omens and the answers to their questions. The last 'The Duelist and the Drifter' shows Lion-o learning (the hard way) that reliying on the overwhelm your advisary with brute stregth is not the way to reliably win fights, especially against skilled opponents.",1320192000,,3809,4.489913544668588
4690017,5,B005G7WGLS,"When I found out ThunderCats was being redone and rebooted, I'll admit to having some trepidation over it. I didn't know what to expect and thought, ""Please do NOT let this be another lousy remake."" When I heard Larry Kenney's voice in the second trailer, though, that changed the game completely. I said, ""Whoa...the ORIGINAL Lion-O now doing the dad? I LIKE IT ALREADY!"" Then after waiting for months on end, that first episode completely blew my mind and got me hooked in a hurry!

This version is more of a reboot than a remake, but I like the direction this show is going so far. Lion-O is now a struggling prince trying to hold the team together, and he's got to grow up naturally as he learns lessons along the way. Out of the first eight eps, the two I consider the best are ""Song of the Petalars,"" which had me in tears because little Emrick stole my heart; and ""Legacy,"" where not only I learned about the Cats working WITH Mumm-Ra, but also seeing Mon*Star from ""SilverHawks"" and Mako from ""TigerSharks"" make cameos! Talk about paying homage to other toons!

The colors are amazing, the stories are fantastic, and I sincerely hope this series lasts for years to come.

I guess the only drawback is what a previous poster said...no extras. It would be better, like interviews with the voice actors (Will Friedle, the aforementioned Larry Kenney, etc.) and such. Oh, well, maybe if it gets the FULL season treatment, that could happen.",1319760000,4,1444,4.654901960784314

In this reboot Lion-O is a prince to a colony of cat-like people when one day an act of good will back fires and the city of Thundara get's destoryed by an army of Lizardmen. Now Lion-O, Tigra, Cheetara, Wily-Kit & Kat and Panthro must travel Third Earth to find the Book of Omens. The art work is top notch and all the episodes (which I saw on Cartoon Network) have great stories and action in them. This DVD comes with the first 8 episodes on two disk.
Disk one has:
Omens 1.
Omens 2.
Ramlak Rising.
Song of the Petalars (This one is really a nice and touching episode).

Disk 2:
Old Friends.
Journey to the Tower of Omens.
Legacy.
The Duelist and the Drifter.

This really is a great reboot to an old classic show that I grew up with. Also what's cool the voice of the original Lion-O from the old series plays as Lion-O's father in the episodes Omens 1 & 2. Honestly if you love Thundercats---give this new show a shot.",1319068800,29,1078,4.358208955223881
