8171271,3,B000MRA862,"...there's just too much filler and some of the critics, by the way, feel some of the songs here are just that, ""filler.""  So what's the point of making a DVD of a major LP in the band's discography if the only important cuts are ONE OF THESE DAYS and ECHOES?  Don't get me wrong, if you're into this album it's because there are numerous mood changes going on that enhance it's appeal...personally, I think it's one of PFs most well-rounded albums just because it is by turns demonic, mellow, gentle and, in the end, spacey but, at the same time, cohesive.  The interviews with the critics are informative but too much time is given to previous albums.  There's also too much on Syd Barrett who had absolutely NOTHING to do with MEDDLE.  I can see his being mentioned as being ""the guitarist/composer/singer who preceded David Gilmour"" but by this time Gilmour had been in the band for at least 2 years and he put his indelible stamp on the group with his amazing work right here.  So this album critique is a bit padded because, let's face it, they didn't make this album so we could tease it apart 40 years later, they made it because they were trying to put out a record to tour the world with and what an album.  Some day maybe the band members would like to put in their 2 cents but they probably can't remember too much by now (they also hung out with Syd) so just enjoy the music for it's time and place.",1204761600,16,1412,4.346007604562738
8171272,4,B000MRA862,"Considering the general level of quality for these sorts of projects, ""Meddle - A Classic Album Under Review"" is especially good. ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meddle/dp/B000002U8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Meddle</a>"" has always been one of those under appreciated discs in the Floydian discography. For those like myself who have an affinity for pre-1973 Floyd, an in-depth examination of ""Meddle"" is most unexpected and much appreciated. The 'make or break' factor for these sorts of non-official projects usually rests upon the quality of the interviewees. In this case, the reviewers have strong backgrounds including those who actually worked with the group and authors of Floydian books. A stand-out is Toby Manning, author of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rough-Guide-to-Pink-Floyd/dp/1843535750/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd</a>."" In addition, the album is explored using photos, album covers and video footage that mostly draws from various films. While it would have been an asset to get some interviews from Waters, Gilmour, Mason or Wright, that's the drawback to these sorts of ventures that don't have the band's blessings. A significant portion of time is spent on the band's career that led up to ""Meddle."" While this may have been done to flush-out the program's length, it helps to put the featured album in proper context. Each song is well-dissected by the various reviewers. The production is low-budget, but it's not a significant distraction. The bonus features include a ""Meddle"" quiz and a very informative featurette on Syd Barrett. Most Floydians will learn something new about the band or the underappreciated 1971 album. In the very least, fans of ""Meddle"" will indulge in the hour long conversation.  ""Meddle - A Classic Album Under Review"" is a good watch for those Floydians who have a special place in their hearts for ""Meddle.""",1187395200,6,1976,5.861111111111111
8171273,4,B000MRA862,"A much-better-than-average entry in the ""Under Review"" series, up there with their look at Nirvana's ""In Utero"" and ""Neil Young 66-72.""

As with all the other ""Under Review"" installments, this is a fairly low-budget, well-made examination that includes no interviews with the principal artists. It does, however, contain the music discussed and a series of insightful, opinionated critics with extensive thoughts on ""Meddle,"" the excellent post-Barrett Floyd album that often gets outshone by ""Dark Side of the Moon,"" ""Wish You Were Here"" and ""The Wall.""

In just over an hour, the program focuses on the early history of Pink Floyd, the musical contributions and gradual disintegration of Syd Barrett, the patchwork post-""Piper"" albums (""Saucerful,"" ""Atom Heart,"" ""Ummagumma"" and the various soundtracks) plus the genesis of prog rock and the group's eventual rise to focus with ""Meddle.""

Each track is analyzed and critiqued, from the opening ""One of these Days,"" through ""Pillow of Winds,"" ""Fearless,"" ""San Tropez"" and ""Seamus."" The breakdown closes with a long look at the side-spanning, 23-minute space rock epic ""Echoes,"" which pointed the way toward the grand scope of ""Dark Side.""  If you like this series, and you like this underrated album, it's worth tracking down. I couldn't rent it online and sprung for a copy, sight unseen, and was completely satisfied. It also serves as a good warm up for Eagle Rock Classic Albums entry, ""Dark Side of the Moon.""",1179273600,25,1465,5.247863247863248
