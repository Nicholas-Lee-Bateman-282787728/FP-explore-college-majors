8715606,3,B00XB2Y6CW,"A group of former sorority sisters go for a weekend at a ranch along with BJ (Andy Gala) a gay Internet film maker. He is filming the scene where 15 years earlier a group of girls were murdered and the killer never found. One by one the girls get killed. There is a horny ranch hand, a lesbian in the group, and some rifts over infidelities. The film attempts to be funny, which created more yawns than laughs. It starts scenes that go nowhere. It seemed to be a collection of ideas that they never finished. Acting was what one would expect for a ""B"" film.

Should be okay as a rental with low expectations. 2 1/2 stars

8715607,3,B00XB2Y6CW,"This movie is no masterpiece, but it did keep me engaged until the end. I have to say that the pacing is too slow for a horror film. It was also emotional drama heavy for a slasher flick, which wasn't necessarily bad (but almost felt like script padding). Some actresses were much better than others, but none were atrocious. I doubt a younger audience would be interested in this movie. This was more for 30+ year old slasher fans. I don't regret watching it, but I'm not sure it has any re-watch value.",1450396800,,504,4.43010752688172
