I am not very experienced with yoga, this dvd is very easy to follow along with.  It has helped to greatly increase my flexibility and overall health.  I am amazed how much it has improved my motorcycle racing as well.  A must have for me.",1218844800,,340,4.106060606060606
3528740,5,B001DDY6RG,"I am a massage therapist specializing in deep tissue and neuromuscular therapy.  Tamara's Yoga Fusion dvd has just become my new best tool! Breathing is an important element in releasing trigger points ,toxins,and those stubborn muscles that have been the center of chronic pain snydrome. I tell my clients if you only have 60 seconds a day just ""breathe"". Now I can honestly recommend an insightful yoga dvd! My hat (or rather my mat) is off to Tamara for her clear and easy on the ear instruction.

But my children come first so this is the next best thing. It has helped tremendously with my flexibility and creating inner calm in my hectic lifestyle and my intense work schedule. I would highly recommend it. She is truly a master in her field.,1218758400,2,408,4.1125

3528743,5,B001DDY6RG,"I was debating whether to buy ""Yoga for Athletes"" or ""Tamara's Yoga Fusion.""  I decided to buy Tamaras DVD and I am extremely happy with the purchase.  This routine is suited for all levels of yoga practitioners. This is a well made dvd that will surely catch on.  I recommend this a BUY!",1218758400,,288,4.39622641509434
8292965,5,B001DDY6RG,"""Tamara has a very healing presence and is a wonderful yoga instructor!
 I highly recommend this yoga DVD to anyone who is looking for a very healing and
 complete yoga experience.

 In my opinion,  the sequence of poses are very logical and intelligent,
 each one leading and preparing for the next one.  I very much enjoy the pacing and timing
too and feel that the poses are given their due with enough time to relax and flow naturally into
the next one.

 You will love this beautiful yoga DVD and encourage you to experience what Tamara has to offer!""

8292966,2,B001DDY6RG,"I purchased this dvd due to the great reviews. It seems like the instructor has ""classes"" that use creativity and modern music, however, this does not pertain to this video. It was a bit boring to me. My husband is a beginner and he could only perform the sun salutations at the beginning of the video. I was hoping to see many other poses not present on the video...I was bored within minutes as the repetition offered little new info with each series.  It has some challenging postures but not impressed with the transition into these.  The instructor should produce videos that reflect her true style if this is not it!!!!",1233964800,4,625,4.621621621621622
8292967,3,B001DDY6RG,"I own 80+ yoga videos,all the famous and well known yoga teachers and then some, and I bought this DVD because I got the impression it was different, something new.
Yoga fusion?? It started in the traditional way, with endless sun salutations, then standing poses, sitting poses, twists and backbends. In my opinion Tamara was just average as a yoga teacher, compared to Babtiste, Bryan Kest, Rodney Yee, to mention a few of the others we already know so well. She brought nothing new to yoga teaching, it's been done a hundred times over - and better - already.
I'm sorry to say this was really a waste of money.
If you're looking for something different, try the queen of yoga teaching: Shiva Rea!",1233619200,14,699,4.645161290322581
8292968,4,B001DDY6RG,"I bought this dvd based on the reviews written here which I suspect may have been written by friends and family.  First let me say that this is a very well produced yoga dvd.  You can see a clip on youtube.  There are different camera angles, images fade in and out of a student from a different angle; titles for each pose and/or set of poses and the guitar music is very very nice.  Having said all of that, the flow itself is heavily based on the ashtanga yoga primary series and it doesn't vary to much from this theme.  As such, it is not all that creative, if that is what you are looking for.  What you WILL get in this class is superb instruction and cuing and straightforward yoga poses.  I don't see where the fusion comes in except that she did add some poses that are not in the primary series, however, she left quite a few of them out such as the complicated twists.  There are no arm balances, no headstand, and no abs, not even boat pose.  It is nicely chaptered so that you can do parts of the class as time permits.

I had to think long and hard whether or not to keep this dvd as I have so many yoga dvds that are more to my tastes.  I'm spoiled by Shiva Rea and my new favorite teacher Jennifer Lynn that I ultimately decided to send this one back. Thank goodness amazon has a liberal return policy!!  If you are an ashtanga yogi and you can not get to your regular class, then this dvd is for you.  As for me, I'll pass.",1229126400,6,1441,4.103571428571429
8292969,5,B001DDY6RG,I read the reviews before I bought this DVD. I have absolutely loved it.  My flexibility and my mood levels have all been raised to a great level. The video is very well done.,1227312000,,175,4.147058823529412
8292970,5,B001DDY6RG,"Attention to anyone who plans to make a yoga video in the future: a new bar has been set. I was amazed when I saw this thing. I never thought I would encounter a video that is actually better than most live yoga classes I've attended. This video is that good. Tamara combines a thorough understanding of the practice with an easy-to-follow teaching method that works for all skill levels. For anyone even remotely interested in yoga  to those who have practiced it for years, if you are going to buy a yoga video please get this one. You will not be disappointed in the least bit.",1220572800,2,580,4.420560747663552
8292971,5,B001DDY6RG,Tamara's Yoga Fusion is a great instructional DVD.  She gives clear instructions on how to properly get into each pose.  Poses are organized together into sections that make sense and work together.  She explains the details of each pose with special emphasis on positioning of all body parts and breathing.  Her instructions are easy to understand for both beginners and more advanced students.  Overall I would highly recommend this DVD.,1220400000,2,439,5.214285714285714

8292973,5,B001DDY6RG,"Tamara's Yoga Fusion is a great yoga DVD - and, what a workout!!  Of course, you can take it easy if you want to, but believe me you can really get a great work out.  A big plus with this DVD is Tamara! Her voice is really pleasant and easy to listen to and she seems so genuine.  She gives very thorough instructions all the way through the DVD. In fact, when you are in the poses she gives additional instructions that allow you to make micro-corrections. I love this DVD!",1219017600,2,474,4.186813186813187
