622617,5,630332102X,"We got these for my son for his third birthday and I'm here looking at the rest of the series.  They are very 'kid paced' and have great 'kid humor' (Chessy, but fun and well recieved by little ones).  Also a lot of 'how  things work' and 'what things are called' learning and great songs.  My son  sings along to ""I've been working on the railroad"" at the top of  his lungs.",956016000,10,375,4.138888888888889

622699,4,630332102X,"Nice video for any child that is into trains.  The majority of the video is of model toy trains.  It is nicely done, low key, but definitely entertaining!  There are some old familiar songs that won't drive you crazy if you have to watch it over and over again.  My grandson LOVES it!",1366156800,,284,4.30188679245283

622704,5,630332102X,"We watch this movie nearly every day for the past 6 months since Grandma sent it for Easter! My son owns an entire cabinet full of Thomas movies and this movie is the one he usually picks for his ""tv time"" each day! I love that his baby sister who is 1 enjoys dancing to the music in it. Safe for kids to watch unattended so it helps me gets my housework done! We love this movie and I came here actually searching for more movies like this one to give us more variety and put under the Christmas tree!",1320364800,,502,4.03
622705,5,630332102X,"Since my four year old grandson loves anything trains, I was first hooked to the ""I Love Toy trains"" series by borrowing them from our local library.  Not only is my grandson fascinated by these videos; so am I.  Also, I am more than pleased that my purchases arrived in a timely fashion, once on the day of his birthday celebration. The hours of joy we share while viewing them together is priceless!",1305763200,2,401,4.47945205479452

622725,5,630332102X,"Our 2 year old granddaughter was visiting us from Oregon, and our two year old grandson from Cleveland.  The grandson is totally into trains, but found competition when watching the ""I Love Toy Trains"" video that I found amongst my old VHS tapes.  Both were disputing whose train was theirs.  I decided to purchase the DVD set to send to the grandson, as he really wanted to stay just to watch the video when parents were ready to go back home.  The video arrived in just two days (had it shipped to their home).  My son says that his son watches these videos daily.
What a great investment.  I have to admit that I was unaware I even had the old VHS and loved it myself.  It goes from the animated to real trains interchangeably.  What fun for young and old.",1282176000,,759,4.333333333333333
622726,5,630332102X,"I bought this for my 4-year-old grandson, and, to my surprise, he loves it!  Like all little boys, he loves toy trains, so I figured he might find it interesting.",1247961600,,162,4.4
622727,4,630332102X,"This DVD is a hit with my five-year-old boy.  He's watched it several times already.  Boys love trains, and there are plenty here to capture his imagination.  Additionally, there are many cool train set toys that complement the trains in the video.  If it weren't for this video I doubt we would ever see the variety of cool toys and trains that have been made.  His favorite is the house that's on fire (with real smoke!) with the fire trucks that respond (with real water from the ladder hose!).  There's a lot of fun here.  My favorite is the train that launches missiles at a target balloon!  I don't think they make toys like this anymore, so this alone is worth the price.

I also liked seeing the real train and then the exact same toy train in the same shot.  The producers must have traveled to hundreds of retiree basements to shoot all the toy train video.  This video has inspired my boy to ask for a larger bedroom so he can build a great big train set!

I took away one star because the production quality is very amateurish.  I was going to cut these guys some slack but judging from the number of products and the length this company's been in business, there's no excuse.  The editing is at times inexplicable and some of the cuts are too fast and too short.  If you ever wondered why they give Academy Awards to film editors, watch something that's been poorly edited.  Some of the clips are seemingly random and pointless (clowns?!).  Also, the songs are good and catchy but the audio quality is unfortunately poor, so a redo of this video (in HD?) would do lots of justice and make this a classic for any boy.",1232755200,3,1629,4.412751677852349
622728,5,630332102X,My two year old loves this movie.  He wants to watch it nearly everyday.  He is even starting to sing along with some of the songs.  I highly recommend this for any train lover.,1232323200,2,177,4.147058823529412
622729,5,630332102X,"My oldest son was a train fanatic. The I Love Toy Trains series is a very wholesome and well done series of film clips of mostly model and some real trains. There are, in fact, very good real train DVDs, but as the title suggests, this is a DVD for ""Toy"" trains - Lionel trains and operating accessories. My son watched these over and over till he could recite the narrated parts. Great value for the money.",1230336000,3,407,4.298701298701299
622730,5,630332102X,"I was able to watch this d.v.d. before-hand, as they had it at the library ,so that I knew that My grandson [and his father] would enjoy it.",1225497600,2,140,4.035714285714286
622731,5,630332102X,"Of course, we are partial to this series as we live near the Hesston Steam Museum and there are snippets from the steam show in these DVDs.  Yes, the narration can get a bit corny at times and the music is repetitive,  but it is designed for KIDS!  My 3 year old absolutely loves it.  He loves to pick out the different trains he knows like Amtrak and Santa Fe.  He gets so excited just like when we get stopped in the car waiting for a freight train.",1220140800,3,451,4.079545454545454
622732,5,630332102X,Best train videos on the market. My Grandson has watched these dozens of times. He knows every Steam engine by site. It has been a great source of learning for him. He sings with the songs. We have the whole set. He started on these at age 2.5 and at 6 still uses them.,1219363200,2,269,4.0
622733,5,630332102X,"My 3-year-old son is obsessed with this DVD.  He will watch the entire thing in one sitting (and it's an 1.5 hrs).  My husband also enjoys it too.  It's mostly toy train layout with the trains running on the displays.  There are also some shots of real trains mixed in.  There are several catchy songs that you will find yourself humming all day long if you buy this DVD.  If you have a kid who loves trains, like my son, this is a great DVD to add to your collection.",1207267200,2,468,4.144444444444445
622734,5,630332102X,My grandsons love this video.  They are 5 and 3 years old and play it over and over.  They have picked up the railroad language and sing the songs.  They can even recognize and name the equipment used on the tracks at our railroad maintenance stop.,1200873600,2,248,4.3478260869565215
622755,5,630332102X,"Wonderful video that will keep the kids enthralled while
parents  do the things that they really need to do.  Parents with down time will also enjoy this no stress video.

Can be seen again and again with no loss of childhood wonder and fun.

I have passed the 15 year old video to young nephews and nieces. Im purchasing this new set of DVD for them to share the joy again",1186531200,2,373,4.211267605633803

622759,5,630332102X,"I purchased this for my youngest son's third birthday because I was tired of checking out the worn out copies from our library.  I had already purchased one volume on video, but the videos from this series don't work very well.  The DVD is terrific!  It keeps William and his older brother Matthew entertained for hours if I let them sit and watch it.  It is really cute to watch, too.  Even the neighbor who baby sits enjoys watching the little toy trains spin around and have accidents.",1141948800,5,488,4.5
622760,5,630332102X,"I have the ""Toy Trains #3"" video. It broke because we played it so much. My son watched it when he was little, and then 10 years later my next son played it until it broke. It is wonderfully full of a variety of really neat toy trains, vintage style music, real conductors calling out - the poor quality comes from the sound bytes being so old. It even has a segment on farms and tractors, a barge digging in a ship channel, a rodeo, and others, just packed full in a short 30 minutes. This one doesn't have the annoying kid narrating, that is the next set. It just has some pretty catchy music. I enjoy watching it myself!",1124668800,6,623,4.2
622761,3,630332102X,"I give this a 3 out of 5 because my toddler, at 20 months, is totally enraptured by this DVD, and it is the first one he has ever actively requested (""Choo choo!  Choo choo!"").  It is also rather absorbing for adults, because many of the setups are really stunning and just plain cool and it makes me actually want to have my own train set.

My toddler also loves the interjections of cows, ducks, and pigs, for while he has no ability to follow the punny jokes they're telling, those are his favorite animals.

That being said, the production quality is more like a one- or two-star value.  The sound quality is horrendous whenever there is a voiceover; some songs are extremely poorly reproduced; and there is a lot of reused footage.  I wonder if the later videos are better quality?",1122508800,2,786,4.5
622762,3,630332102X,"As the name indicates, this DVD shows various toy trains in action.  These are the types of toy trains that grownup train enthusiasts would have in their basement.  The narration is not interesting and they tend to repeat a lot of the video.  They also tend to show a lot of the accessories to toy train sets such as automated log loaders and drum unloaders, etc.  They especially like to show when these things don't work and they also show a lot of toy trains falling off of tracks and bridges.

Our four-year-old really loves trains and he likes this DVD, but it's not the train DVD that he asks for.  Overall, our son likes to watch real, full-size trains instead of the toy trains.  The train DVDs that our son likes better are ""Real Wheels - There Goes a Train"" and ""Alphabet Train"".  He likes There goes a Train the best.  It is narrated by ""Engineer Dave"" who goes over things like how trains work, and the different types of trains, etc.",1117843200,42,946,4.421965317919075
622763,3,630332102X,"My 2-1/2 year old son LOVES this DVD, and all of the others as well.  I can actually enjoy it myself, as it can be mesmerizing.  However, what I don't enjoy about this video, compared to the other volumes, is the kid that narrates it.  He talks way too much and it's just irritating.  I hope this companys' future videos leaves out the kid!",1082505600,12,340,4.265625

BEWARE this is sold as the original but it is lower quality as a duplicate and has way more new sound effects added from the original and some different scenes and footage. If you are buying for the first time, you probably won't care. But we bought this to reminisce and relive a childhood favorite and it is NOT the original and misses the bill for our purpose.
