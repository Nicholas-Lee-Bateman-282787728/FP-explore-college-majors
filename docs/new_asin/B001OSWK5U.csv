8331402,1,B001OSWK5U,"Don't waste your money this is awful. I received this as a gift. If i could give it -5 I would. First it arrived in a cheap flimsy torn box. The title clearly states 2 DVD/1 CD/1 massage oil. What I received was 1DVD, 1CD some dollar store candles and a tube of gold bond lotion! REALLY?! This is the worst gift ever DO NOT waste your money on this. I already have this thing boxed back up and ready to send back.",1391990400,,413,3.9879518072289155
