1759131,5,B00006HAWE,"i bought this tape the other day, and i have already done it twice.
I look forward to doing this tape because it's not too long (25mins) and it actually works on the areas where i need it.
The tape consists of 5-6 mins of Kathy explaining what the powerhouse is and how it should feel, then moves on to the work out with the ""100"" and some other pilates abs sets.
Then moves on the the thighs, inner first and then the outter thighs.
This tape is short but sweet, it hurts after you do it and Kathy only does 4 to 8 reps per set, which is good because they are slow and sometimes painful.
I definitely recommend this tape, it is mostly for the thighs, there are barely any butt exercises that she focuses on.
Highly enjoyable.",1060128000,7,726,4.192857142857143
1759132,3,B00006HAWE,I usually love Kathy's workouts but this one was a disappointment though I liked it better than her Pilates for Abs DVD. There are better Pilates DVDs out there.  (Try Jennifer Kries Pilates Method for a true workout!)  This one could have been combined with her equally short Pilates for the Abs.,1042761600,8,297,4.6923076923076925
1759133,5,B00006HAWE,"Kathy Smith challenges you with a Pilates workout for the Lower Body. This targeted, isometric workout will build core strength and stability, while challenging you to think and breathe.
Some of the exercises are similar to the Pilates for Abs workout. For example, Kathy starts out with the Pilates Hundred and for a final stretch, she uses the mermaid. Some of the exercises are modifications from the Pilates for Abs video, for example Kathy does the shoulder bridge, but adds a kick. There are even a few exercises that I have not seen in any Pilates workout on the market today. That originality really brings something extra to this workout.
The DVD includes a 6-minute warm-up, and a 25-minute workout. This workout runs about 5 minutes longer than the Pilates for Abs workout. It is challenging, and will make substantial gains in your lower body in terms of strength and flexibility. An essential component of a well-rounded fitness regime.",1040860800,15,949,4.9748427672955975
1759134,5,B00006HAWE,"Of course, Kathy looks amazing!!! Kathy provides an excellent breathing guidance though out the workout. Also the name of each pose is written out so you'll get familiar with common terminology. Initially, Kathy shows the beginners variations and then does the more advanced version herself. On the other hand, her assistant shows the advanced variation the entire time. This is great because the workout could be adapted for any level of flexibility.
In terms of intensity of the workout, one really feels how the leg muscles get involved. I was happy to see some new Pilates exercises that have not been provided in other Pilates workouts (I've seen Denis Austin's and Jennifer Kries'). It's about 30 min and your legs muscles would feel really stretched. One has to be aware of the core muscles as well, so one gets to work the abs at the same time.
One has to be aware of hers/his posture while doing the exercises otherwise one might not get the real benefits. Kathy says in the DVD that ""if it feels easy, then you are doing something wrong"". If you do them carefully, you'll feel your muscles working.
It is a great workout for lower body and I could see how it helps elongate the muscles. In the future I would probably combine it with another lower body segment and do the Pilates one at the end to stretched the muscles and relax them as well.
I really liked the workout and I am happy I got it. One definitely needs something that focuses on working, relaxing and lengthening the muscles at the same time. That will prevent you from bulking up.
You'll feel you leg muscles getting leaner and longer! Great Pilates workout! Excellent guidance by Kathy Smith!",1034294400,19,1668,4.6768707482993195

7968927,3,B00006HAWE,"I would not suggest this workout for the average pilate user.  This is an intermmediate to advanced workout.  Usually I love Kathy's instruction, but this workout contain so many steps to achieve one movement that it became frustrating to follow the routine. Some of the terms she used were completely foreign to me. If you are considering buying this workout make certain you know your pilates.",1222214400,2,395,4.96969696969697
7968928,5,B00006HAWE,"This is an excellent place for beginners to introduce themselves to Pilates. It is also a relaxing workout for intermediate Pilates students. Kathy Smith creates a beautiful caring environment with a garden patio and beautiful mat colors.

The Hundred - a breathing exercise you do while you are on your back with feet in the air. Challenging for the stomach muscles.

Roll Ups - from a completely flat position on your back, you roll up. Once you accomplish this, the satisfaction of being able to do this is immense! It is really challenging at first, but then you develop core strength.

Single-leg circles - while on your back, you circle each leg
Double-leg Kick - laying on your stomach, you bend and extend your legs

Shoulder Bridge - laying on your back, you raise your hips
Shoulder Bridge with a Kick - with hips raised you raise and lower one leg
Knee Squeeze

Side-Kick Series - a series of toning exercises for each leg
Swimming - you lay on your stomach and swim
Mermaid - a nice stretch you do side to side while kneeling

The entire experience is comforting, all while seriously toning your lower body. There are enough strength challenges to keep you focused and the exercises are classic.

7968929,4,B00006HAWE,"In this video, Kathy Smith offers a very good Pilates workout which specifically targets the lower body.  She begins with a 6-minute instructional section which addresses fundamentals of Pilates.  In this section, Kathy provides excellent descriptions of basic Pilates concepts such as breathing techniques; the c-curve, pelvic scoop, and neutral spine alignments; engaging the hamstrings; and the Pilates powerhouse.  This is a great introduction if you have never done Pilates before, but once you are familiar with Pilates principles, you can skip over this section.
The actual workout consists of 25 minutes of Pilates mat work.  Kathy begins with classic Pilates exercises such as the hundred, leg circles, and shoulder bridge; her assistant, Lija, shows modifications for each exercise.  After doing several moves lying on her back, Kathy flips over to lie on her stomach for some work more targeted on the hamstrings and glutes (for the exercises done while on the stomach, Kathy's instructors are dubbed in via voiceover, which is a little odd given that she uses live instruction for most of the workout).  The final section of this workout is performed while lying on your side for the Pilates side kick series.  Kathy leads a particularly tough sequence of moves in this series, and you will really feel the work in your outer thigh and hip areas especially.  The workout ends with a seated mermaid exercise to provide a nice stretch.  If you enjoy Pilates and would like to specifically focus on your legs, hips, and behind, this video would be an excellent choice.",1084752000,20,1577,5.1050583657587545
7968930,5,B00006HAWE,"This is an excellent beginning Pilates video.  Kathy uses common metaphors to help you relate to the various muscles and poses.  She also constantly reminds you of the proper breathing cycle, which is very important in Pilates. It is easy to follow and understand, but you really feel the muscles being worked.",1080518400,8,310,4.9423076923076925
7968931,2,B00006HAWE,"I am 55 yrs. old, work out at home, and attend a weekly Pilates class. I think I am moderately ""fit"". I had hoped this tape would provide a good at-home workout. I chose this after reading the various reviews for this tape and Kathy Smith's ""Abs Workout"", and assumed this would be more challenging. Unfortunately this tape is not much more than a beginner's workout, failing to adequately address the lower body, and was a real waste of money. To describe this as a ""Lower Body"" tape, is simply misleading.
I have been a long term fan of Kathy Smith. I have recommended her Shaper Ball and Aerobic Boxing tapes to friends. I enjoy her style of instruction and the production values. However, this workout simply does not deliver what it promised.",1072828800,12,747,4.62406015037594
7968932,5,B00006HAWE,"I WAS ALWAYS INTRIGUED ABOUT PILATES BUT THOUGHT IT WOULD BE TOO HARD. OF COURSE I CHOSE KATHY SMITH BECAUSE SHE'S MY FAVORITE AND I LIKE HOW SHE INSTRUCTS THE MOVES IN THIS VIDEO. SHE'S VERY CLEAR AND USES GOOD EXAMPLES TO DEFINE THE MOVES LIKE PRETENDING TO BE GOING THROUGH PEANUT BUTTER WITH YOUR LEGS.  I DON'T BELIEVE PILATES COULD ACTUALLY MAKE YOUR LEGS LONGER, BUT STRETCHES OUT THE MUSCLES SO THEY DON'T BULK UP PLUS OVER ALL TONING. ALSO, THIS WORKOUT REQUIRE ALOT OF THINKING SO YOU DON'T MOVE YOUR MIDSECTION WHICH IS A CHALLENGE.",1060473600,5,543,4.597938144329897
