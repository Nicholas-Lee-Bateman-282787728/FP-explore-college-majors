8069782,3,B0009XT8QK,"""Born to Fight"" is a 68 minute black & white 1936 film from Alpha Video showcasing actors Frankie Darro and Kane Richmond as boxers.  Boxing champ Tom 'Bomber' Brown (Richmond) takes a swing at gambler 'Smoothie' Morgan (Jack La Rue) and has to flee from the law and Morgan.  In a hobo camp, Brown discovers 'Babyface' Madison (Darro), a promising slugger who uses his right hand too much.  Brown trains Madison in Chicago, where Madison's featherweight career takes off.  Gym owner Nan Howard (Frances Grant) has her eye on the pseudonymed Brown.  There are ups and downs and jealousy from pal Madison.  African-American trainer J. C. Snowflake (Fred 'Snowflake' Toones) provides some comic relief.  At last comes Madison's big chance to fight in New York.  Brown has to go back to 'Smoothie' Morgan's turf.  How will it play out?

There is the normal violence of the boxing ring and some rough and tumble with the gangsters.  There are no sex scenes.  The skin scenes are of Madison/Darro training or boxing and a couple of Brown/Richmond boxing. The language is as expected for a 30's movie.

The picture and sound are good.  This is a short, enjoyable film.",1199750400,2,1161,4.8274111675126905
