8589065,5,B00D3K9Q22,"I'm a big fan of Vincent Price. The DVD contains decent transfers of these films and they were all a lot of fun to watch. Vincent Price is great and the movies also feature such great talent as Peter Lorre, Peter Cushing, Basil Rathbone, Nigel Green, Patrick Magee, Barbara Steele and others. Roger Corman puts on stellar directing performances in 3 of the films and features the writing talents of acclaimed writers Richard Matheson and Charles Beaumont.",1501286400,2,455,4.922077922077922

8589068,4,B00D3K9Q22,"This is a good collection of the work of Vincent Price from his heyday during the ""Golden"" Years of movies to the time of his star being on the wane. ""Tales of Terror"" is a personal favorite of mine, because of the perception of extra value for more stories. And being that all three stories are based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe, makes it even better! The first story is ""Mirella"" a tale of a wife, who died too soon, seeking revenge from beyond the grave. The second tale is ""The Black Cat"", a bit of humor in between two gothic tales. Peter Lorre stars as an alcoholic, who somehow forges an unlikely friendship with Vincent Price, who plays a classy wine expert.  The third tale, my personal favorite,"" The Curious Case of Monsieur Valdemar"".Price plays the terminally ill Valdemar who is being treated with hypnosis by his doctor, played exquisitely by Basil Rathbone

.""Madhouse"" was made as American International Pictures was starting to bring down the curtain on Price's career as a horror film star, with the goal of replacing him with a younger star, Robert Quarry. The very real tension between Price and Quarry is practically oozing from the screen during their scenes together! Price plays an actor who has had quite a career playing a single malevolent character, Doctor Death. It is when it seems that his character is no longer content to remain just a character he plays on screen, but begins to commit real murders, P
Price is committed to the titular madhouse.

 ""The Pit and The Pendulum"" is another tale from the pen of Edgar Allan Poe, and like ""Tales of Terror"" it was directed by Roger Corman, with the screenplay by Richard Matheson, who wrote many of the classic episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"".

""The Masque of the Red Death"" is also directed by Corman, and features a lovely young redhead, Jane Asher, who captures the interest of Price, At the time Miss Asher was the fiance of Paul McCartney of  The Beatles. In this film, she plays a poor, woman of virtue, and it is that quality that drives Price's evil character to view her virtue as a challenge to be broken.",1489449600,2,2098,4.626344086021505
