2161545,5,B00062IYWI,Finally [they] are beginning to make these comedy classics available in quality commercially produced boxed sets. For years (decades) fans of these movies have had to scrounge them from late night TV broadcasts and they were always chopped up (edited) to allow for commercial interruptions. If you are a fan of these guys (as I am) then these are a must have. - SBJ,1356652800,,365,4.71875
2161546,1,B00062IYWI,"This disc is so compressed, that the movements look like painted animation!  If Platinun Disc would release these as two to a disc, they would look much better.  Don't bother with this 4-movie DVD, you can not watch it!

'NEATH THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE - Similar to the Alpha/Gotham edition but with more artifacting from the compression. Watchable.

PRIDE OF THE BOWERY - Unwatchable! So compressed that it is annoying to try to watch. There is a trade-off, the Alpha/Gotham copy has distorted & noisy audio which you can not understand.

MILLION DOLLAR KID - Similar to the Alpha/Gotham edition but with more artifacting from the compression.  Watchable.

BOYS OF THE CITY - Unwatchable!  So Compressed that it is annoying to try to watch.

Unless you plan to watch this on a 15"" TV screen you had better look for other copies, even VHS copies!",1109116800,8,841,4.784722222222222

2161617,5,B00062IYWI,"There are two types of people- those that like the East Side/Dead End/Bowery Boys movies and those that don't.
If you fall into the former, then the question becomes - how bad is the print? These are not bad prints, not great, but until somebody ponies up the money to do a professional remaster, it is the best we can get.
If you are a fan, enjoy- if not- save your money",1362355200,,372,4.180555555555555
2161618,1,B00062IYWI,The description said it was closed captioned and it is NOT. I am hearing impaired and that is why I order this and two others and all of them said closed captioned and none of them were. I sorted through multiple items looking for the closed captioning so I am angry.,1360886400,5,267,4.254901960784314

2161620,5,B00062IYWI,"""Boys of the City"" has been a favorite movie of mine since I was a small child. To this day I can't watch it without laughing out loud. The other three movies on the disc are added bonuses, all entertaining. The service was great, and the product is just what I would expect from decades old movies, a few slight imperfections, but nothing that would take away from my enjoyment. I love it.",1359936000,,390,4.3561643835616435

Funny movies with fun characters and concise stories.  Some slapstick and crude humor,  but no pofaniy.",1434672000,,268,4.617021276595745
