8121002,1,B000FDFSEU,This movie was terrible and not scary at all. It doesn't depict the beauty of the Santeria Lucumi religion and gives False stigma and negative conception of this beautiful religion.. I should have known better because santeria doesn't use a pentagram... very silly this was,1487548800,,273,5.088888888888889

8121004,4,B000FDFSEU,"I like independent films, and this one is decent.  Yes, it is a little bit of a slow start, but this is a lot better than many of the independent horror films you find out there.",1428624000,,178,3.9444444444444446
8121005,1,B000FDFSEU,"You know you are in for a rough ride when the opening has ""Virgin Mary sitings"" as opposed to ""sightings"". The beginning of the film is a spoiler as it tells you how it ends. Little Ricky consumes a cursed Eucharist and begins to have Virgin Mary sightings, one which looks Mexican as opposed to the Nordic lily white Mary we all know is how she really appears. Some in the family believes he is demon possessed as he lays on the ground and stares aimlessly at the sky.

Next his sister Sara (Maria Fonseca Sotolongo) goes off her meds, and she starts seeing stuff too. Like I said, we already knows how it ends. How the film gets to that point is done in an extreme amateur fashion with bad acting and script. Film includes English subtitles when Spanish is spoken. Might have some MST value if it is free. Carmen (Nellie Gonzalez) is the closet thing to eye candy in this film (lingerie).

Parental Guide: No F-bombs, minor swearing. No sex, a couple starts to make love but stops. Some blurred demon nudity. Careers violently killed.",1341705600,3,1036,4.50531914893617
8121006,2,B000FDFSEU,I thought this was fairly interesting but it is like some Mexican American exorcist type of movie without the great special effects. It is definitely strange and at times boring but someone out there might like this kind of movie.,1320192000,,230,4.775
8121007,1,B000FDFSEU,"You only need to look at the cover art for this movie to know the makers didn't do much research into their subject. An inverted crucifix in the title? Great. Santeros are very much anti-Satan. (Funfact: the Petrine Cross is a perfectly valid Christian symbol). And what's with the pentacle brand? If it were inverted, that would imply Satanism, and piss off Wiccans as much as a Satanic cross pisses off Christians, but it's right-side up. Wicca and Santeria aren't even in the same family of religions, so what the hell is this religious symbol doing there?

You won't get an answer from the movie, which features a grand total of no identifiably Santerian elements. The only religion presented accurately is a brief scene of charismatic Protestants, who inform us that Catholics are all horrible damned idolaters. We're meant to agree with these sentiments, but it would help if anybody had bothered to research Catholicism in the slightest, let alone the syncretic blend of Catholic and Yoruban belief that is Santeria.

Who would identify the Virgin Mary's blood as a Eucharist? Nobody.
Who would identify an egg hatching harmless garter snakes as a bad omen? Not a person who believes Oxumare, the Rainbow Serpent, is Yemeya's crown, and a positive, creative force.
Who would enjoy this slow-paced, poorly-shot, low-budget dreck? Nobody who would be looking it up in the first place.

Read a Jack Chick tract. It's cheaper.",1289174400,,1429,4.995798319327731
8121008,3,B000FDFSEU,"I personally think this movie was ""ok"" it wasn't as Horrific, or shall I say scary as I thought it would be, but I do like the movie - I found it to be more of a suspense than a Horror flick. Look I am a practitioner of Santeria and it is based on some Catholic & Christian beliefs. We do practice what we have to practice, but I assure you that we believe in ONE GOD and that is GOD THE ALMIGHTY & JESUS CHRIST (I say this due to all the negativity & what people think...that we don't believe in GOD THE ALMIGHTY). I hope you enjoy all the comments above me and also that you enjoy the movie.",1282262400,,593,3.909090909090909
8121009,1,B000FDFSEU,I like watching Independent Films but this was just crappy. Cinematography sucked...storyline made a mockery of Catholicism. Even the sound sucked. You could barely hear the people! Waste of the 1.95 I paid for it.,1179100800,5,214,5.142857142857143
8121010,4,B000FDFSEU,"Santeria is unique and interesting because it is both horror movie and cultural experience. It isn't the fastest paced horror movie available, nor is it the most frightening. It is a bilingual horror movie, thick with a mix of Catholicism, Santeria, and even Mayan faiths.

The story surrounds a young boy, Ricky, who sees visions of the Virgin Mary. Many in his community rally around him, believing that he is receiving a miracle. However others, including his perhaps mentally unstable cousin Sara, believe something far more sinister is happening. Others aren't sure what is happening, and the end of the film, it's most shocking sequence, doesn't provide easy answers.

One major downfall of the film is it's slow start. The first twenty minutes are, quite frankly, boring. If you can make it through, you're rewarded with a very fun, interesting horror movie for the next hour. It isn't polished by any means, and the special effects are pretty third rate- no big budget blockbuster here. What the film lacks in polish it makes up in heart. It's apparently a labor of love. The acting isn't bad at all, and the plot interesting.

All and all, this is a fun and entertaining horror movie, but because of the slow start and the bilingual aspect, it might not be for everyone. This is more `artistic' than `horrific' yet it's still good.

Recommended for those in the mood for a different sort of horror movie.",1169856000,6,1413,4.8264462809917354
