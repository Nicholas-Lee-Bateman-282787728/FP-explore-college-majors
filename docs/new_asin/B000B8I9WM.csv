8083437,4,B000B8I9WM,"Kazuki is wizard, but he can only use his magic 8 times before it kills him. Some of the most powerful magic families in the country find out about his dormant power and send their daughters to get his genes. That's pretty much the story.

This anime isn't very deep, but it's got some really neat characters and good animation. The soundtrack is all right too. Even though the story is pretty regular there are a few touching moments, it also delivers plenty of comedy too. I'm not gonna lie and say it's one of the best animes I've seen; but I'm glad I did see it. It's pretty enjoyable. Maybe check it out on youtube or netflix to see what you think.",1354147200,,653,4.308943089430894
8083438,5,B000B8I9WM,"Well, to begin with a few words about the storyline (Just keep in mind that the storyline refers to the entire series and therefore SPOILERS will be included!!!)

If you are looking for Mechas like FMP or Evangelion, a deep emotional like Mirage of Blaze or The Last Exile and so many others, than you should skip this one.

If one the other hand, you are looking for something like Oh! My Goddess, a harem anime, romantic and action comedy etc. than you are definitely in the right place.

The story unfolds in a world similar to the ones we already know with the difference that many people are able to use magic and werewolves, ghosts and so forth is something that people are accustomed with. The place: A High-School that consists of students that are able to use magic. The catch: Each student has a specific number of times that can use his or her magic and if used up than will turn into dust (basically, die).

The story resolves around our main protagonist, Kazuki, who is the typical looser guy (at least at the beginning, as it usually happens to the harem animes) but is the descendant of the most powerful magicians, meaning that his son will become the strongest magician ever; but has two main `problems': 1. Can use his magic only 8 times (which proofs to be super strong) and b. all females of the high-school will try to get his genes which will create the entire comedy!

Then we have the other three main female protagonists: Yuuna, who claims that she is his wife and lives together with him, Rin who is a samurai girls (and at the beginning would prefer to kill him) and Kuriki, the super hottie and super rich girl who would like to seduce him.

Apart from it, the story will mainly resolve around these four protagonists, the relationships they will create, the adventures they will encounter (they will have to deal against a ghost-hunter when Kazuki will turn into a ghost for a while) and of course what choice Kazuki will make...In addition, you will be introduced to various other characters who will influence the outcome of the story as well.

Last but not least, Kazuki has a good heart and will try to help the others in his own expense and everything will depend on a promise he made when he was very young (or should I sea, two promises ;-) ).

As for the animation: It is good, compare it to the one of Oh! My Goddess and you will have a very good picture.

The music is good, starts with a nice pop/rock song and ends with a ballad.

The dub, is good done as well; but to be honest as well, I have seen better dubs as well but still it is a good one.

As for the extras, it has the typical stuff: Not credit opening/ending, trailers etc.

As for the storyline: It is very good, has a good character development, solid and has a few twists in it (but we also should keep in mind that we compare it for its genre as it is).

To the most `interesting' question: Buying it or not? To begin with, the price is the typical one that you most probably will find out there, therefore, having watched the entire series I can recommend the shows so that you can have a different and funny magic/romantic/comedy in your collection.

I hope that I could help you with this review :-)",1156896000,,3208,4.39695945945946
8083439,5,B000B8I9WM,"I own every single volumn of maburaho that is out so far. This volumn isn't exactly my favorite, but it wasn't bad.

Ep. 16 It starts off with kuriko going off to some dates with a ""supposidly"" rich fat cat and the guy actually ends up asking kuriko to marry him. The surprise is that she actually accepted the offer and that just shocked kazuki and the rest of the group. Later on you find out why she actually did it and i guess this was one of those filler episodes to just make the series seem longer. This episode really didn't have much to do with the story line.

Ep. 17 This was one of the most hillarious episodes that i have ever seen. It starts off with the school getting a magic exam and it as a result nakamaru (shikimori's ""friend"") ends up finding out that his ""genes"" may be superior to kazuki's and that he will be the father of the most powerful magician in the world. With that in mind he is just set on courting Yuna and from there on out his class turns into his throne room with the other classmates being his servants. Now the real question is will Yuna, kuriko and Rin still go after kazuki even though their families order them to take nakamaru's ""genes"", or will they follow through and stay with kazuki until the end? Find out in watching this episode.

Ep. 18 This was one of those filler episodes, but i guess it doesnt hurt to give the public some info. It starts off with the class going to a trip and it involves the relationships between the kamishiro family and the morasaki families. Those two families have been going at each other for about 800 years now and the class of 2B decides to use this opportunity to make some money. The ending to this episode is a major cliff hanger because in the end of the fight neither of them were the winner. That isn't the cliff hanger though. In the end of the episode we see chihaya yamase (from volumn 2) meet up with kazuki, but there seems to be a problem. All of the girls start to feel this immense burning feeling in their hearts and body. What can this mean??

In the end i guess this was an ""ok"" volumn. It was entertaining ill give it that but it just didn't stick to the story too much. Its worth buying if you are currently collecting the series, but don't expect anything too good like in volumns 1 and 2. Those were probably the best so far that is out.",1133136000,,2341,4.242152466367713
8083440,5,B000B8I9WM,"If you follow teh series, you know it stays true to teh comic roots and still has a pretense of seriousness even with all teh glitter and skin the covers hint at. This time it's a class trip to Kyoto. All I will say so as not to spoil it for anyone interested (if that's possible) is that it was teh awesome and I can't wait for teh next episode.

8083441,5,B000B8I9WM,"Now this is what I've been waiting for! My favorite part of the manga was always the Urabutosatsujin. (the illegal martial arts tournament)If you're familiar with the manga this dvd covers chapters 43-49. But I really can't wait till the 6th volume, that covers one of my fav parts of the manga, (well at least hopefully it gets that far) where Team Hokage goes up against Uruha-Maboroshi (Genjuro's team) I'm a little worried that my favorite part of the tournament (covered in manga volumes 9-11) will be seriously different from the manga. The reason I'm worried is because of the opening. It looks like Recca is fighting Gashakura, (which in the manga Gashakura is fighting Fuko), Domon is fighting Kashamaru (but in the manga Recca is fighting Kashamaru, which is how I hope it'll be because it's a ninja battle that brings Rui out, one of my favorite dragons of the Hachiryu.)but at least we know that Kaoru will fight Tsukishiro going by the open scenes. My favorite character from Flame of Recca is Fuko (which is why I love the Hokage vs. Uruha-Ma, because Fuko really shows her strength against Gashakura)

my fav quotes from there are:

 Fuko: ""Fuko of the Fujin is gonna explode"" &

 Gashakura: ""Fuko, I just want you to know, I don't look down on

 you for being a woman. To me, we're just two people trying to  kill each other.""

 I'm sure you've read this a thousand times but I'll say it too, Flame of Recca is just like the pure action parts of YYH.

Well to finish this review, volume 5 covers the Hokage vs. Ku part of the manga. To be more specific, Daikoku vs. Tokiya, Minamio vs. Domon, Fujimaru vs. Fuko, and the start of Saicho vs. Recca. hope this helps.
