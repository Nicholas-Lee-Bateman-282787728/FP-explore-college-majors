8072619,4,B000A2VL74,"My dad bought this video for my one-year old for his birthday along with the a few CDs and one of the books.  My son loves this video and asks for it everyday.  We literally play this video in my house at least 3 or 4 times a day.  He likes the CDs too, but as one reviewer stated, this really brings the songs to life.  I agree with another reviewer that the video quality isn't great, but my son doesn't seem to mind.  We've played other videos for him of some other children's artists and he wasn't as interested.  Perhaps it's the children he's drawn to in this one or the fact that there is a little animation in the video, but this one is his all-time favorite.  I highly recommend it for any parent of a toddler.",1359072000,,719,4.129496402877698
8072620,2,B000A2VL74,"I highly recommend every Orozco CD out there, they're all 5-star quality. T

But sadly, this DVD is a big disappointment. The quality of the video and the camera shots are amateur at best.  In many verses of the songs the children's mouths are moving but there are no children's voices, just Orozco's.  It looks as though someone took a video of a TV show and then patched in the CD for audio in the spots where the video camera couldn't pick up the TV sound well enough.

I hope someone gets some good video of this wonderful singer while he's still with us.",1239321600,2,559,4.346153846153846
8072621,5,B000A2VL74,"This DVD has Jose-luis Orozco and a group of children sing several songs. Many of them have hand movements to accompany them.  The mood of the DVD is happy and uplifting.  The songs are accompanied by images (such as letters, numbers, elephants) and are repeated often enough that an adult with some Spanish knowledge can catch on quickly and sing along with their child.  Most of the DVD is presented in Spanish, though some songs are done bilingually (Spanish/English).

The recommended age on the DVD is 2-8.  But our 13-month-old was enchanted, as long as an adult sat with him to watch it.  It was only the second DVD we've shown our child.  I plan to add more Jose-Luis Orozco items to our library.",1231891200,,704,4.629032258064516
8072622,4,B000A2VL74,"I bought this DVD after receiving a CD of Jos Luis Orozco (De Colores).  My daughter (now 8 months old) has loved the CD for months, to the extent of ending a crying jag and beginning to smile and cock her head to one side the instant she hears it begin.  The DVD has an even better effect, since she can see Jos Luis's hand movements and see the other children singing along (or trying, in some cases) and also doing movements to match the music.  I can't say how much she loves Jos Luis, both this DVD and the CD that she has.  I took off one star simply because the image on our DVD is not always clear.  Jos Luis is wearing a light-colored outfit throughout the DVD, and at some points (especially on the first song), it is so bright that the rest of the screen looks like an overexposed photo.  Of course, your baby won't notice this, and it doesn't bother me, but some people do seem to mind it.  That being said, I can't wait to order more products by Jos Luis Orozco, since he really gets what grabs children's attention.  She is growing up in a bilingual (Spanish/English) household, so these materials are perfect to reinforce both languages for her.  The whole family is now a Jos Luis fan!

EDIT:  I wish I could give Jos Luis his star back.  We have since discovered that it is our DVD player, and not the Cantamos y aprendemos TV, that makes the image appear too light.  My daughter still loves her favorite ""star"", and I wish I could thank Jos Luis Orozco and all the people associated with making this DVD for giving her so much joy!",1217548800,8,1549,4.281786941580756
8072623,5,B000A2VL74,"I love the cd's produced by Jose Luis Orozco.  The DVD brought the songs more ""to life"" for my child, (who already loved the cd's).  I highly recommend it.  It is colorful and the songs are well articulated.  The children in the dvd with Orozco are precious.",1141776000,11,258,4.425531914893617
