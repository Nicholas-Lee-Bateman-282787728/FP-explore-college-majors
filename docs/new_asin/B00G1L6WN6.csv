8620111,5,B00G1L6WN6,"If you love the blues, then ya gotta buy this DVD! This is an all-star guitar blow-out with some of the greatest names in the blues business. Albert Collins, B.B., Steve Cropper, etc. -- the only criticism possible of this disc is the simple fact this is a ""vintage"" performance and not the hi-tech concert video we've all grown to expect in the 21st century. -- but that's the blues, and that's what makes this a ""must have"" in your concert collection!",1397865600,,453,4.536585365853658
