First up.  Harvey.  I am reminded of John Barrymore's death bed assessment that death...""Death is easy...Comedy is hard!!""...for here Jimmy Stewart gives one of his most endearing and utterly charming performances that takes you into a world of fantasy and light delicate comedy that is done with pitch perfect timing by a cast to die for (Josephine Hull and Cecil Kellaway among many talented others)  The story is witty and the subject of our tale Harvey the six foot rabbit is handled adroitly with special effects that have aged most graciously indeed.  A Classic by any standard and worth the whole set alone but hold on to your hats...for there is true genius yet to come...

Which brings us to Touch Of Evil....springing from the ever fertile mind of Orson Welles and originally dumped upon the American audience in a studio cut that eviscerated Welle's original vision...and yet later with the notes that Welle's had presciently provided said studio restored to his original cinematic triumph.  The legendary opening shot lives up to the genius of the man behind it and the story of Mexican/American border machinations involving corrupt cops and seedy characters brought a fitting end to the era of Film Noir brandishing flourishes only Welles could conjure with his camera and shadows and light and evoke from his obese self playing the most corrupt of them all.  Charlton Heston square jawed and playing against type is a force to be reckoned with and Janet Leigh's scintillating fragility adds dimension to the violence on display throughout this play on morality and morass, but it is the immortal Marlene Dietrich who has the last laugh with one of the greatest last lines in movie history.  You can't go wrong here and you get to see it as it was meant to be seen.

Lastly we come to Stanley Kubrick's bastard child Spartacus, a film he decried and considered belonging to Kirk Douglas who had put his reputation and money on the line to make and had great input in the final product, but still it is a considerable achievement for any Director in any circumstances and bears the Kubrick touch throughout.  I say bastard child because of Kubrick's reluctance to admit it into his canon of work, but it does prove one thing that his other films do not, that the genius of Kubrick could be turned to the Hollywood stereotypical big screen epic with brilliant results.  Spartacus is story telling at its very best and holds your attention to the very end without ever letting you down for a second.  It has everything that movies can deliver, love, hate, war, revolt, kindnesses and contempt and finally the brotherhood of man.  Kubrick had no reason to shy away from his child and I'm sure the rest of the family will eventually welcome it into the fold.

An eclectic trio by any standards, but each film is worth more than the asking price for all three.  The prints are outstanding and the sound is treated as reverently as possible.  Each on separate disk. And separate holders within the case.  I cannot possibly recommend this as highly as it deserves.",1403740800,9,3128,4.771799628942486
5016441,5,B006TTC5F4,"SPARTACUS and TOUCH OF EVIL and HARVEY. Well that is an interesting selection of films to combine. SPARTACUS is an incredible and emotionally charged film and an endearing one. HARVEY is also endearing. TOUCH OF EVIL is a masterpiece of sight and sound. What makes this trio of films work is the diversity, yet they all show the power of good filmmaking.",1380240000,2,354,4.725806451612903
5016442,5,B006TTC5F4,"I've seen all these films, but the one that struck me the most was Touch of Evil. Nevertheless, they are all excellent films.

HARVEY was Jim Stewart at as aw' shucks, charming, everyman best. Surprisingly funny, though somewhat dated, Harvey is a charming showcase for the talent of it's leading man. 4/5

SPARTACUS is one of the greatest epics ever made, yet Stanley Kubrick hated it. It was a labour of love by star Kirk Douglas, who strides the film like the brilliant colossus he was - heroic, charismatic, and conflicted. With epic battle scenes, brilliant cast and characters, and cinematography for the ages, the highlights of Spartacus include some brilliant gladiatorial combat and Peter Ustinov's snivellingly good role. This is more than a movie. It is a Motion Picture Event. 5/5

And now for my review of Touch of Evil:
What can I say about Touch of Evil other than it is a bonafide masterpiece. The camerawork is to kill for, and that famous opening shot is enough to make a cinephile weep. The imagery and cinematography is true Wellsian genius: dark shadows, impressive angles, and amazing shots. If Touch of Evil existed only as a series of moving images without sound or plot, it would still be a must watch in the book of any cinephile.

And on top of that, the cast is absolutely stellar. Charlton Heston - that 6'2 broad, strong-jawed, gravitas machine - gives one of his most complex and emotional performances as Ramon Vargas, a Mexican narcotics officer embroiled in a plot of murder, kidnapping, and dirty cops in a Mexico bordertown. Janet Leigh shines (almost literally) as his wife Suzie. We know her mostly from her iconic (but short) role in Hitchcock's Psycho, but many forget that she stayed in a creepy secluded motel before that (though the outcome was better). It's nice to see her get a bigger role.

Marlene Dietrich plays the exotic fortune teller Tana with her special mysterious exoticness, and Zsa Zsa Gabor and Joseph Cotten have brief cameos. But outshining them all is Orson Welles, who not only directs, but stars in one of his most memorable roles (excluding Kane), as morbidly obese, sweaty, dirty cop Hank Quinlan, who (thanks to camera angles) dwarfs the film like a colossus. Hank Quinlan is a lurid, peering, growling giant of a character; fiendishly entertaining and delightfully evil. In more ways than one, it is Orson Welles that elevates this pulpy, lurid tale to one of the great late film noirs of all time.

Lurid, strange, perverse, dark, thrilling...these and more describe Touch of Evil. A must watch for film students and fans of noir and great films in general, Touch of Evil is an entertaining, sleazy look at the dark underside of the US-Mexico border and the dirty cops that run it. But Touch of Evil shows another's touch - that of cinematic genius and auteur Orson Welles: a man so forward-thinking Hollywood cast him out, a man so brilliant every great filmmaker in the world takes notes from him. Orson Welles rewrote the playbook of cinema forever. Citizen Kane might be his most famous film and his masterpiece, but Touch of Evil is so deliciously dark and entertaining that it is not to be missed. 5/5",1380240000,4,3176,4.797074954296161

8504115,5,B006TTC5F4,"Three terrific films on three separate discs. I have a soft-spot in my heart for ""Harvey""...a funny, gentle and inspirational film with one of my favorite actors (Jimmy Stewart that is, not Harvey). I almost paid more money for the DVD having only this single film, but then I found this  great  three DVD set. ""Spartacus"" of course is the well-known  spectacle film, directed by Stanley Kubrick,  with a terrific cast  and memorable lines ...""I'm Spartacus""... plus the delicious sly comments of Peter Ustinov.  And then to top it off  there is ""Touch Of Evil""...an outstanding gritty B&W crime noir film directed by, and staring Orson Welles, along with Charles Heston, Janet Leigh and Marlene Dietrich. The opening shot is one of the longest and best orchestrated shots ever and this celebrated film is one I had the pleasure of studying in college. Orson Welles is outstanding as the slimey, obese and corrupt police captain Hank Quinlan. All three films are well worth viewing and having in any film collection.",1487635200,,1016,4.9411764705882355

8504120,5,B006TTC5F4,Glad this was the revised version that Orson Welles wanted of Touch of Evil. I had only seen the censored version. This is the first time that I Dalton Trumbo's Spartacus.
