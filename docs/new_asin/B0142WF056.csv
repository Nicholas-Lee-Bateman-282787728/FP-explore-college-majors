This is a slick and polished product, like some TV advertisement for a product you don't need. History is found in books, movies provide entertainment. This story starts in 1951 Manchester England. A man is held in a police station, another man talks to him. Earlier two policemen enter Turings home; he reported a robbery but nothing is missing. [Note his arrogance.] Then its wartime in 1939, British children are being evacuated to the country. Alan goes to Bletchley Park. Their aerials are explained by their radio manufacturing. He is a mathematical prodigy but doesnt speak German. He is good at puzzles and like solving problems. They show the Enigma cyphering machine. The Germans change the key every day. Sir Stewart Menzies is in charge of MI-6. All German messages are sent by radio in code. Alan plans a machine that can decipher all messages every day. [Polish military developed a bombe years earlier, but they had limited assets.]

Turing wants this machine to replace human labor. Churchill backs his idea. At school he was harassed cruelly. There is a puzzle in the newspapers to identify talented people. The Blitz causes people to seek shelter Underground. Miss Clark is a candidate, she tested well. She has doubts but they are resolved. Britain was vulnerable by its food supply, U-boats sank freighters. Some of his co-workers complain. Alan visits Miss Clarke for advice. Can a Universal Computing Machine act as an electronic brain? There is a leak, a Soviet spys messages were intercepted! One clue in deciphering messages is that any letter cannot be encrypted to itself. Solving Enigma messages requires all the help Alan can get, he must be liked by his team. He makes a joke. One has a suggestion to improve speed. The machine starts processing to calculate the Enigma key settings for the day. Does it work now? Alans co-workers stand up for him when his efforts are questioned. One month.

Back to 1951 the police find the man who burglarized Alans home, but this reveals a crime by Alan! Miss Clarks parents want her home. Is there a logical solution to this problem? In the lunchroom his coworkers laugh at a dirty joke. [Unbelievable with ladies present.] Alan asks a coworker for advice. [Nobody jitterbugs at that dance?] Can a machine think? No, it responds the way it was programmed and cannot generate new ideas. Does working together result in romances? [Yes and no.] Helen has a clue! [In reality the Wehrmacht messages always began with Heil Hitler, a clue to decipherment.] The machine runs until it stops with a solution. Alan copies the key. The Enigma machine decodes the intercept. They rejoice! Can they warn that convoy? There would be a cost to this. [This is really a higher level decision, as with Coventry.] There is a personal interest. [The convoy system grouped freighters together so destroyers could guard them.] Will statistics be used to manage the war? ULTRA was the name for this secret. A coworker has a Bible; he offers Alan a deal. Denniston knows how to manage things. Alan breaks up with Joan. So what? Joan knows what she wants. The intelligence they supplied helps to win the war (it is a force multiplier). There is Victory in Europe! All records will be destroyed to keep the secret. [In reality the decoders had new messages to decrypt.] Back to 1951 Alan is arrested and given hormonal treatments instead of prison. He becomes emotional when Jane visits. In 1954 Alan died a suicide. He was given a posthumous royal pardon in 2013. The ULTRA operation shortened the war and saved millions of lives. The ULTRA secret was revealed 25 years after the war ended. It allowed the XX Committee to function efficiently.

This is a fictionalized and dramatized story about the ULTRA system and the use of a machine-generated encryption system. There are history books that will tell you more.",1503964800,,3889,4.8700906344410875
