3955470,3,B002N4XO8Q,"Before I get started, it should be noted that Taz replaced Don West on commentary after the Hard Justice PPV so this is his TNA PPV debut on commentary & because of issues regarding her work visa, Angelina Love was released from TNA.

TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship Tournament Finals: Taylor Wilde & Sarita vs. The Beautiful People (Velvet Sky & Madison Rayne) - This was a decent opening match that had a couple of miscues at times & went too short for a match that's suppost to introduce a new championship. I will say thought that what happened with Slick Johnson before the match was a nice twist & Wilde & Sartita worked well together to the point where the commentators were trying to push them as the female Rock N' Roll Express.

Hernandez vs. Eric Young - This was almost an exact copy of Hernandez's match at Hard Justice last month where it did it's job in making Hernandez coming off strong while getting over Eric Young's character. Nothing more than a quick squash to put over a storyline.

X Division Champion Samoa Joe vs. Daniels - Just like how the storyline for this match was setup, this match was a throwback to 2005 when the X Divison was what gave TNA it's identity because of the performances given by those like Joe & Daniels. This was real good & without a doubt the best performance both men have had in recent memory with great inring storytelling & even saw some new innovative offense that Taz & Tenay didn't know how to call at one point. This didn't top the level of their more famous classics with A.J. Styles from years ago but was definately the match of the night but it was definately the match of the night.

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Suicide vs. D'Angelo Dinero - Before I get started, knowing that Stacker 2 was the sponsor of this PPV...you'll get a laugh out of the pre-match promo. Anyways, if you were a fan of the Hardcore Title matches WWE & WCW used to do during the ""Monday Night War"" era than this is exactly for you because they spent more time out of the ring than they did in it (seriously, I think they were in the ring for around 1 min. at the most) as this went outside, backstage, ringside era, and the entrance stage using whatever they could get their hands on. There were various standout moments like Suicide ""making an ass"" of The Pope at one point along with the ending which I had to say was one of the most dangerous stunts I remember seeing. Again, if you are a fan of these type of matches then you'll really enjoy this.

TNA Knockouts Championship Match: O.D.B. vs. Cody Deaner - After ""The Deaner"" scored the win for his team at the last PPV, this was a match to determine who was the true champion. As expected, this was all about comedy from Taz & Tenay doing their own ""stand-up"" routine on commentary to the wrestling in the ring with Deaner doing various things like a low-blow on a female and even getting on the referee's case to the post-match promo with O.D.B. about winning the Knocked Up Title (that's not a typo) that even had Taz laughing. Just like the Hernandez match earlier & the tag match at the last PPV, this is one of those matches where you have to accept it for what it is to enjoy it.

TNA Legends Champion Kevin Nash vs. Abyss - This was about Kevin Nash attempting to collect the bounty that Dr. Stevie put out on Abyss with Mick Foley doing commentary during this match (and had some fun with Taz about their commentating in WWE) as well. This match was just average as it was more about pushing Abyss' storylines with Foley & Dr. Stevie more than anything else...and the ""over the top"" finish didn't help either. As a side note, anyone who remembers the past gimmicks of ""Big Daddy Cool"" with Kevin Nash & Stevie's own paraody of Kevin Nash in ""Big Stevie Cool"" will maybe get a chucke of out what happens afterwards.

Lethal Lockdown Match: Team 3D & Beer Money vs. Booker T, Scott Steiner, British Invasion - For those who haven't seen a Lethal Lockdown match, it's held under the same rules which the old WCW/NWA match of War Games where under. One man from each team starts the match and after a period of time, another member from one team (which has always been the heel team for those trivia buffs) enters and after each time period, the teams alternate sending members in. Once all team members enter the cage, the roof containing all the weapons is lowered onto the cage and the only way to win is by pinfall or submission. Just like the previous Lethal Lockdown matches in TNA, this was a very entertaining multiman brawl with various highlights like a member of the British Invasion getting a double suplex on top of the cage along with Brother Ray going chair crazy to the point where he gave Rob Terry a chairshot that was probably one of the stiffest chairshots you'll ever see in your life.

Bobby Lashley vs. Rhino - This was the TNA inring PPV debut of Lashley who TNA has been hyping as a double sport athlete by doing MMA & TNA at the same time. However, this didn't live up to the hype surrounding Lashley as this match was just ""fine"" and the crowd sounding like they really weren't into the match and a finish that I thought looked real weak didn't help either.

TNA Champion Kurt Angle vs. A.J. Styles vs. Sting vs. Matt Morgan vs. Hernandez - You read that last name right as Hernandez cashed in his ""Feast Or Fired"" case but don't that fool you as Hernandez only made a quick cameo here by showing a huge display of strength with a delayed vertical suplex that was a page out of ""British Bulldog"" Davey Boy Smith's playbook before being taken out by Eric Young & having this go back to the original four way as advertised. This was similar to the main event at Hard Justice with Angle & Morgan making an alliance (after Angle ""took the bullet"" for Morgan at one point) with the difference this time being Sting had an ally in Styles. Look out for the ending where Morgan tried to take a page out of Angle's own playbook only to backfire with A.J. Styles becoming the TNA Champion thanks to Sting. This match did it's job in being a good quality main event and pushing the storylines between Angle/Morgan & Sting/Styles leading into Bound For Glory at the same time.

In the end, this was an above average PPV that had some good matches (4 way main event, Lethal Lockdown, Knockouts tag, Suicide/Dinero), some average matches (Nash/Abyss & Lashley/Rhino), one standout performance (Joe/Daniels), and some repeats of Hard Justice (Hernandez squash/Knockouts Title match) where your either going to like or hate depending on if you accept the match for what it is & the story they were telling but overall, this is a TNA event worth checking out as well.",1255046400,,6679,4.480690221857025
3955471,3,B002N4XO8Q,"TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship Match: Sarita and Taylor Wilde vs. The Beautiful People (Madison Rayne and Velvet Sky)
No Angelina Love thanks to business issues. DAMN IT! Well, they did the best with what they had I guess. Sarita and Taylor dominated at first with some high-fyling moves, and Sarita even pulled out some unique pins on Sky. However, Sky and Rayne started to wear Sarita down. Sarita and Taylor got the advantage again and Taylor went for a German suplex on Rayne, but Ryane resisted. A poorly executed springboard dropkick from Sarita allowed Taylor to hit the German and bridge it to get the win and become the first ever TNA Knockouts Tag Team Champions. Winners: Sarita and Taylor Wilde. Match Rating: 3/5

Grudge Match: Eric Young vs. Hernandez
Why do they do this pretty much every pay-per-view? It's really making me hate Hernandez. Well, Hernandez basically clothesline Eric Young a few times and then shoulder blocked him to the outside. Hernandez threw Young back into the ring and hit the Border Toss for the victory. Yippy skippy. Winner: Hernandez. Match Rating: 2/5

TNA X-Division Championship Match: Samoa Joe (Champion) vs. Daniels
Awesome match! It started out with Joe dominating Daniels, but Daniels regained the advantage using high-flying moves. Joe did ground Joe though by catching him coming off the top ropes with a Rock Bottom! Joe then applied some nerve holds on Daniels. Daniels did manage to fight back though and hit a Suicide Dive on Joe to the outsid! Daniels hurt his knee attempting this though, and Joe took advantage, smashing Daniels's face right into the steel steps! Daniels tried to get back into the ring, but Joe clotheslined the back of Daniels's leg! In the ring, Joe applied an Ankle Lock/leg bar submission hold but Daniels managed to get the ropes. Unrelenting, Joe then applied an STF, but Daniels still managed to get the ropes. Daniels then fought back with a neckbreaker and other power moves. Daniels then went for the BME after hitting an STO on Joe, but Joe rolled out of the way. Daniels DID land on his feet though. Daniels went for the Angel's Wings, but Joe managed to power out of the move. Joe then went for the Muscle Buster, after grounding Daniels with a very unique offensive move focusing on the injured leg, but Daniels fought out of it and went for the Last Rites, but Joe countered and locked in the Coquina Clutch. Daniels tried to fight out of it, but Joe got him on the ground and applied a body scissors to compliment the move, forcing Daniels to tap out. Winner: Samoa Joe. Match Rating: 5/5

Falls Count Anywhere Match: D'Angelo Dinero vs. Suicide
This could have, and should have, been better, but it's still good. Dinero was in the middle of an interview when Suicide ambushed him with a doubler axehandle backstage. They then brawled around in the backstage area, and Dinero took some pretty sick bumps. Suicide back body dropped him into a wheel barrow, and also threw him onto a steel guard railing, which made him land on some concrete. Dinero tried to climb a fence to escape from Suicide, but Suicide pulled Dinero's pants down and yanked him off the fence and onto a pile of wood! They continued to brawl, but Dinero got the advantage. Dinero smashed a cup on Suicide's head and then they fought to the ring. Suicide actually regained the advantage here, but Dinero grounded him with a suplex on the ramp. A table was set up next to the ramp, and Dinero went for a suplex off the ramp through the table, but Suicide actually fought out of it. They then brawled over to the top of the stage where Dinero's attempt at a DDE off the stage on Suicide was countered with a mule kick to the face. Suicide then brought out another table and set it up on the ramp. Suicide's Suicide Solution was blocked, but he did managed to hit a Rolling Hills on the stage onto Dinero. Suicide set Dinero up on the table and climbed onto a ledge above the entrance way and went for a leg drop, but Dinero moved, causing Suicide to crash through the table. Dinero covered Suicide for the win. Winner: D'Angelo Dinero. Match Rating: 4/5

TNA Women's Knockout Championship Match: Cody Deaner vs. ODB
This was a joke match, but it was still pretty damn entertaining. ODB beat the crap out of Cody at first, but the Deaner fought back and manhandled ODB. ODB responded with some strikes, but Deaner grounded her again and then got in the referee's face. The referee then refused to break ODB's pin attempt on Deaner when he got the ropes, and he even helped ODB roll Cody up! Cody did manage to kick out, and then ODB ate Deaner's Knockout Punch! This only got a two count, and Cody then went to the top ropes and started drinking out of ODB's flask! ODB got Cody off the top and hit a TKO to defeat Deaner and officially win the title! Winner: ODB. Match Rating: 4/5

Bounty TNA Legends Championship Match: Kevin Nash (Champion) vs. Abyss
Pretty good, but they got the rules a little bit mixed up and towards the end it became a mess. It started out with Nash and Abyss hitting power moves on each other in the ring, but then the fight spilled to the outside where Abyss tossed Nash into the steel guard rail and the steps. Back in the ring, both Abyss and Nash were going for Chokeslams on each other, but neither could get the other top. Abyss tossed Nash to the ground and then saw Dr. Stevie on the stage sitting in a chair, watching. Abyss turned around and ate a Big Boot from Nash! Stevie distracted the referee and tossed a chair into the ring, which Nash used to smash into Abyss's face. This only earned the two, and this prompted further referee distraction from Stevie. Daffney then ran into the ring with a taser, but Abyss laid her out with an astonishing Black Hole Slam! Nash stopped Abyss from tasering Daffney, but his attempt at the Jackknife Powerbomb was countered by Abyss. Abyss then called for Mick Foley, who was providing guest commentary, to bring him the barbed wire baseball bat! Foley tried to, but Abyss ended up cutting his hand on the barbed wire, and while the referee got Foley away, Nash tasered Abyss's BALLS and then rolled him up! After the match, Stevie refused to pay Nash, so Nash Jackknife Powerbombed him. Winner: Kevin Nash. Match Rating: 4/5

Lethal Lockdown Match: Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm) and Team 3D (Brother Ray and Brother Devon) vs. The British Invasion (Brutus Magnus and Doug Williams) and The Main Event Mafia (Booker T and Scott Steiner)
This match was good, it just didn't live up to expectations. It started with Storm and Magnus, with Storm beating the crap out of Magnus and even hitting the Eye of the Storm. Williams came out next and they double-teamed Storm until Roode entered the match and cleaned house with some unique tag team moves along with Storm. Steiner was in next, and then everything just got confusing. It was madness and random violence until Brother Ray came out. Big Rob ambushed Brother Ray and whacked him in the back with a steel chair and ordered for the roof to be lowered. Ray did regain his posture and then SMASHED a steel chair in Rob's face! Ray then entered the match and ""cleaned house"" with very weak chair shots. Brutus tried to escape to the roof, but Roode and Storm followed, and they hit a double suplex on Brutus on top of the cage. With a crap load of weapons in the ring, with Devon smashing a trashcan lid in people's faces and everyone hitting their finishing moves, it all got really confusing. A highlight was when Ray placed a trashcan on Booker's crotch and then smashed a crutch on it though. The end came when Beer Money hit the DWI on Williams to get the win for their team. Winners: Beer Money, Inc. and Team 3D Match Rating: 4/5

Bobby Lashley vs. Rhino
This was just...okay, I guess. The ending really ruined it. The match started out with power moves, but Rhino grounded Lashley with some submissions. Lashley fought back, but Rhino pushed the referee in the way when Lashley went for the Spear. Rhino then laid Lashley out with the Gore as a new referee came in. This only got a two count though, and then when Rhino went for another Gore, Lashley hit him with a...""Knockout Punch"" for the win. I am not amused. Winner: Bobby Lashley. Match Rating: 3/5

Five Way TNA World Heavyweight Championship Match: Kurt Angle (Champion) vs. AJ Styles vs. Hernandez vs. Matt Morgan vs. Sting
Hernandez cashed in his Feast or Fired briefcase right before the match began. Anyway, Hernandez dominated Angle out of the ring while the other three men watched. However, when both Angle and Hernandez were out of the ring, AJ and Sting started double-teaming Morgan. Hernandez gave Angle a suplex on the ramp and then went for the Border Toss off THE STAGE, but Eric Young ran out with a baton and smacked Hernandez in the back. Young then gave Hernandez a very poorly executed piledriver on the stage, which caused medics to come out and take Hernandez to the back. Anyway, Morgan tried to get away from Sting and Styles, but they ran out of the ring after him. AJ went for a Suicide Dive on Morgan, but Angle ran in the way to take the shot for Morgan! This renewed their friendship, and Morgan and Angle started working over Sting and Styles together. In the ring, Angle and Morgan double-teamed AJ to the point that AJ rolled out of the ring, but Sting came back in and got the advantage on both men. Sting even hit a freaking missile dropkick on Morgan! Sting then hit the Stinger Splash on Angle and Morgan repeatedly, but Angle fought out of the Scorpion Deathlock. AJ came back into the match and saved Sting from a double-team. Morgan hit the Hellevator on AJ, but Angle broke up the pin and hit the Angle Slam on Morgan. Sting laid Angle out with the Scorpion Death Drop, but Morgan broke up the pin. Morgan hit some of his signature offense on AJ, but while he was on the ring apron, AJ hit him out of nowhere with a Pele Kick! Sting was taken out by an Angle Slam, but AJ attacked Angle and hit the Styles Clash! Morgan broke up the pin, but then Morgan was sent to the outside courtesy of Sting!!! This match is awesome. Angle knocked Sting down and then kept Styles grounded with his usual offense and then went for a Tombstone Piledriver! AJ countered into a Styles Clash attempt, but Angle rolled through with it and locked in the Ankle Lock! Morgan came back into the ring and LAID ANGLE OUT WITH THE CARBON FOOTPRINT! Sting and Styles then worked together to knock Morgan back over the top rope! Sting and AJ stared at each other for a second, but then Sting left the ring and hit a flying clothesline on Morgan off the ring apron to the outside, acknowleding that his wrestling career is coming to a close, and AJ's is just beginning! AJ then hit a springboard 450 Splash on Angle to WIN THE TNA WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP! Winner: AJ Styles. Match Rating: 5/5

OVERALL EVENT
Not the worst pay-per-view ever, but not even close to the best either. It was okay, but some of the matches didn't live up to expectations. The Suicide/Dinero match still wasn't as good as it should be and the Lethal Lockdown Match didn't live up to the hype. The main event was awesome, and Daniels/Joe was awesome, like usual, plus there was some nice storyline progression here and there and some big surprises, but overall, it just wasn't as good as you'd expect.",1254614400,,11370,4.575073601570167
8374689,5,B002N4XO8Q,A+,1492387200,,2,2.0
8374690,4,B002N4XO8Q,"In their final go-around before ""Bound For Glory 5"", TNA went out and threw two big surprises at their audience: first, they delivered a really good show, and, secondly, they crowned a new champion, taking the title off of Kurt Angle one month before their biggest show of the year. While this might sound like desperation, it actually ended up doing TNA some good in the long run. Not to mention that it was a big moment since AJ had never held the TNA Championship (his previous reigns were as NWA Champion).

The main event featured a 4-way match with Angle, Styles, Sting and Matt Morgan... that became a 5-way once Hernandez cashed in a title shot. Of course, Hernandez only got a few minutes to show off before Eric Young came out and took him out of the match. So, with the original match back on, these guys went crazy giving us a memorable match full of fast-paced action and drama. The pay-off was unexpected and built up expertly in the match.

Elsewhere, the tag teams faced off in an 8-man Lethal Lockdown match (the first held outside the Lockdown event) that ended up being an awesome match of the night. The X Division also had a good night with Samoa Joe and Christopher Daniels putting together a great match that would've taken match of the night on most shows. In the surprise of the night, Suicide and the newly debuted D'Angelo Dinero fought in a fun Falls Count Anywhere garbage match full of ridiculous spots and even a little comedy. Even a big man match with Abyss and Kevin Nash succeeds based on Nash's grunt work and smart booking with Dr. Stevie's interference.

There were a few matches that didn't work well, though the only one I really disliked was the Rhino/Lashley match that just wasn't very good; they went for a style that highlighted Lashley's supposed double-sport athlete nonsense and the match suffered. Hernandez also squashed Eric Young in a match that was to set up the angle later in the night.

Even though I thought this was a great show, it wasn't up to ""Slammiversary"" or ""Turning Point""; however, it managed to deliver four or five different kinds of wrestling natches and they were all good! If you like wrestling, there's something here for you.",1411344000,,2199,4.645244215938304

Great X title match, hilariously awesome falls count anywhere match, hilarious knockouts title match (both storyline + match), combined with a fantastic match for Bobby Lashley, great Lethal Lockdown match, and ending out with a great 5-way main event. Very much recommended!",1404432000,,445,4.717948717948718
8374693,2,B002N4XO8Q,"I was so pumped for this show and it just let me down a lot. The Matches that are worth watching are the Letal lockdown match, the X Divsion Match, and the Bobby Lashley match only 3 good matches how cheap is that but then Again 2009 was not a great year for TNA if your TNA fan I say pick this up if not stay far away from this ppv",1378944000,,332,3.6901408450704225
8374694,4,B002N4XO8Q,"Prior to Hulk Hogan & Eric Bischoff coming to TNA, the company was actually getting better and getting back to the way they used to be!

Were they perfect?! No! Did they make nearly anything that TNA is putting out currently look shameful?! YES!

Anyway, let's get to this card:

Taylor Wilde & Sarita Vs. The Beautiful People (Finals Of The TNA Knockout Tag Team Championship Tournament) - Originally scheduled to be Velvet Sky & Angelina Love for the B.P.'s, a real life business conflict forced Love out of TNA for a time. Madison Rayne replaced Love for this match and became an official member of the B.P.'s. Meanwhile, the team of Wilde and Sarita was becoming a very popular tag team in TNA. Commentator Mike Tenay said that Scott D'Amore compared them to a female version of the Rock n Roll Express. Personally, I look at them as versions of WWE's Lita & Trish Stratus and how they could've looked if they would've been a regular team!

Anyway, the match itself was good for what it was. My only real complaint is that it was a little too short and considering this was the finals of a new championship, you would think this would've been a bit higher in the card! Nevertheless, it did put Sarita and Wilde over and they became the first Knockout Tag Team Champions! Good opener!

Hernandez Vs. Eric Young - Quick squash match to put over the storyline between Hernandez & World Elite (that was lead by Young)! Nothing special but still a good thing to watch.

Christopher Daniels Vs. Samoa Joe (X-Division Championship Match) - This was definitely a return to the past match and a good one at that! Much like A.J. Styles and Daniels, I don't think Joe and Daniels can have a match that sucks! While nowhere near the intensity of their past matches, it is still a good match. I will give credit to TNA writing on this one too. They did a good job building this one up by using the past of these two men. While I would've loved to have seen Daniels win over Joe, I am not complaining about Joe getting the nod here. At least they made Christopher Daniels look strong in defeat. Joe retains the X-Division title.

""The Pope"" D'Angelo Dinero Vs. Suicide (Falls Count Anywhere Match) - Most of this wild and fun bout took place outside of the ring. I am not sure but I think they were only in the ring for about a minute or so in the whole match! We saw Dinero try to run over Suicide with a golf cart, Suicide exposing Dinero's ""moon"" and other crazy spots! Ends when Suicide tries to do a leg drop off of the stage onto Dinero through a table but misses! Dinero quickly gets the pin and wins the match!

Also, check out the interview prior to the bout and the one in the bonus features afterwards! Both are hilarious!

Cody Deaner Vs. ODB (TNA Knockouts Championship) - The angle leading up to this was certainly entertainig as both face and heel in the Knockouts division were against Cody. As it was, this was just a comedy bout with a few bumps! Not great but certainly not boring! ODB wins and regains her championship!

Kevin Nash Vs. Abyss (TNA Legends Championship Vs. $50,000 Bounty) - In this match, Nash put his Legends title on the line against Abyss with a $50,000 bounty on the head of Abyss given by Dr. Stevie Richards! The match was slow and plodding as you would expect from two big guys like this. Ends when Mick Foley tries to give Abyss his barbed wire baseball bat but as he does so, Kevin Nash tasers ""The Monster"" in the family jewels! Man, what a way to lose a bout! Nash gets the pin but when he tries to collect the bounty, Dr. Stevie demands that he finish off Abyss! Big mistake as Nash powerbombs Stevie and takes the money anyway! Not a good bout but a unique ending!

The British Invasion, Booker T. & Scott Steiner Vs. Team 3D & Beer Money (Lethal Lockdown Match) - Basically, this match works like WCW/NWA's old WarGames matches. It starts with two men for 5 minutes and from there, they alternate one guy at a time until all the men have entered. At that point, weapons are lowered into the cage and it ends by pinfall or submission only!

I've seen a few L.L. bouts and this one was okay. It really doesn't pick up until the end when Brother Ray comes down and creams B.I.'s Rob Terry with a steel chair! That shot was nice! Ends when Beer Money gets the pin on Doug Williams. Okay bout but gets good towards the end.

Bobby Lashley Vs. Rhino - For a bout that was supposed to feature the return of Lashley to PPV, this one felt flat! It was stiff and all but it just didn't have a good feel to it. The only time it got interesting was when Lashley went for a spear on Rhino but hit the referee instead. This was followed by ""The Gore"" on Lashley which looked pretty stiff! Ends when Rhino went for a second ""Gore"" but was caught with an uppercut from Lashley but it looked rather weak. The right man went over though as Lashley wins his TNA debut.

Kurt Angle Vs. Matt Morgan Vs. Sting Vs. A.J. Styles (TNA World Title Match) - Before this bout started, Hernandez joined the bout via his ""Feast or Fired"" contract which entitled him to a match at anytime, anywhere. This was more or less a showcase for Hernandez, Styles and Morgan with Sting and Angle getting in their moves but putting the other three over! Hernandez gets taken out of the bout by Eric Young when he piledrives him on the stage outside of the ring.

This wasn't the best multiple man match for a title but it wasn't the worst either. Ends when Sting, who had the chance to pin Angle, looks at A.J. and decides to go outside the ring to get Morgan. This left Styles to get the pin with a springboard 450 splash! Styles wins his 4th world title and his 1st TNA title (the previous three was under the NWA/TNA name)! The celebration afterwards was great too as Christopher Daniels rushed the ring to celebrate with Styles AND TNA allowed fans into the ring to congradulate Styles! I was watching and thinking to myself ""NOW THIS IS HOW YOU CELEBRATE A WORLD TITLE WIN!""

To be honest, I got this DVD just for that last part in the main event alone but this whole card was pretty good! Certainly one of TNA's better cards! Recommended viewing and purchase!",1314403200,,6458,4.526586620926244

Falls Count Anywhere
D'angelo Dinero vs. Suicide
This match was probably the best match of the night. This match started out brutal and took place mostly in the parking lot. This match had tons of action and some good moments like, suicide almost being run over by a golf cart, Suicide pulling Dinero's trunks down, and the OMG! moment when Suicide puts himself through a table off the entrance way. This match is very enjoyable and very brutal. If you like these types of highflying, brutal matches, then you will love this one.

Lethal Lockdown
Beer Money inc. and Team 3D vs. Scott Stiener and Booker T and The British Invasion
This match was also canidate for match of the night. This match is very good and has very good weapon use. A lot of double teaming in this bout between booker and scott, and has a lot of good moments like, Bubba going chair crazy and almost hitting Devon, a double suplex by Beer Money on Doug Williams on the top of the cage, and a huge DUI from Beer Money for the win. This match is very good, watchable, and another brutal match on this card.

This was a pretty good match, but just wasn't the right match to be before the main event of the evening. This match had some good counters and ground and pound action from both men. A big win for Bobby with his first win in TNA in singles action.

5-way match for the TNA World Heavyweight championship
Kurt Angle vs. AJ Styles vs. Sting vs. Matt Morgan vs. Hernandez
This match started out as a four way but turned into a five way when hernandez cashed in his feast or fired breif case, but moments later was ruined by eric young and other wrestlers. This match was very good and had tons of action. The ending is very confusing though because after a scorpion death drop by sting, AJ comes in and sting leaves and goes after Matt morgan, and AJ gets the 450 splash on angle and wins his first TNA world heavyweight championship. The aftermath is great with styles having the celebration of a lifetime with daniels and maybe 30 or 40 fans. Good match here and worth watching, but a little short.
4.5/5

This was a good ppv but didn't have any five star matches. I do recomend getting this and adding it to your TNA collection!",1279152000,3,3274,4.4072847682119205
8374697,3,B002N4XO8Q,"Taylor Wilde & Sarita VS Beautiful People: I skipped over this match.

The Poor Man's Chris Jericho, Eric Young VS Hernandez: I remember this feud but this was nothing more then a quick squash match that never got off.

X Division Champion Samoa Joe VS Daniels: Helluva match with a great finish. I never seen these two wrestlers have a bad match against each other.

Falls Count Anywhere Match, Suicide VS The Pope: It starts off in the backlot, goes to the ring, and ends up on the ramp. Just like every other match(besides Joe VS Daniels)it had it's moments but the ending sucked.

TNA Knockouts Champion Cody Deaner VS ODB: I'll admit I should have skipped over it but I watched it and it was very enjoyable. Lots of back and fourth encounters in the end made it a good match.

Abyss VS Kevin Nash: Nash wanted the bounty that Dr. Stevie put out on Abyss. This was a typical Nash match and Abyss wasn't very good during this period in his career. The ending was very stupid as Nash wins with a taser to the nuts.

Letheal Lockdown, Team 3D and Beer Money Inc VS British Invasion, Booker T, and Scott Steiner: A enjoyable match just like any other match on the card-good moments but the match felt off. I did enjoy Beer Money's double suplex on top of the cage.

Rhino VS Lashley: I think these two wrestlers are the most overrated wrestlers in the past ten years. Its hard to imagine Lashley to lose after TNA hyped him up the whole PPV. Decent encounter and the ending looked stupid.

TNA World Champion Kurt Angle VS Matt Morgan VS Sting VS AJ Styles VS Hernandez: Herenandez cashes in his Feast or Fired case and is put into this match. While batting on the ramp, Eric Young hits Herenandez in the leg with a weak shot and hits a botched piledriver. The match had alot going on with AJ winning the title in the end. Confetti falls, wrestlers empty the locker room, and a celebration in the ring ensues to end this show.

Overall, most matches had cool moments but they weren't good overall besides Joe VS Daniels. TNA was on it's A game during this period. They followed storylines and built feuds and they were on a roll until they signed Hogan and Bischoff.",1275696000,,2166,4.435768261964736
8374698,5,B002N4XO8Q,"I won't go into the matches as the other reviewers did a fine job with that however what I will talk about is the commentary! As noted Tazz & Tenay do the honors here and it is STELLAR!! Tazz seems so refreshing from his days at WWF and sounds to really enjoy being with TNA AND IT SHOWS!! The Pope vs. Suicide match is reason alone to buy this DVD now mix that with some of the best commentary I've heard since the ""Attitude Years"".

I know it sounds silly but anyone that's seen wrestling live will tell you it's not the same without the commentary and commentary can and will break even the best match if it's not done properly. Tazz and Tenay are Great and EVERY Match shines from this!

TNA has always been about great action and this DVD showcases that and IMHO this a MUST BUY just to hear Tazz and Tenay rip it up together!",1258070400,,831,4.1875
