I can't believe this movie is still around! :) Sadly, when I was eight years old...I moved to a new home and Mumfie the movie was thrown away by the neighbors who moved in..rather than giving it back to me :( I love Mumfie and I still love it now! It is absolutely the best movie in the whole wide world! No wonder I'm obsessed with musicals now! Mumfie is the best and a MUST SEE! <3 You will cry your heart out, it is full of wonder and will fill you with bliss!",1353628800,,469,3.9473684210526314
7867889,5,6304244746,Every one will love ''the little Elephant with the great  big heart''. A fantasy to end all fantasies. You realy feel like you are in the movie. Each character is full of life and  personality. This movie is a must see .I saw this movie when I was 5 and know I am a teenager who looked all over for this musical VHS.,995673600,4,316,4.0
7867890,1,6304244746,"this movie, at 1 hour and 50 minutes, will have you looking at your watch wondering when it will end. i'd swear all the voices are done by the same guy and the accents employed to hide this fact are terrible. the story is convoluted, and should have been edited down to about half of the current  time it runs. for instance, the entire underwater scene is unjustified; how  does this help the story? it is implausable, but explained away with mumfie  had no problem breathing underwater because he's a special elephant  ! i don't want to be a crank, but come on!  the songs are  forgettable and it sounds like they stuck them in without any thought to  1)how or 2)if they would move the story along. it also sounds like they  tried to cover every possible genre of music in this video. the few good  points are; the backgrounds are well done and the layouts are exciting.  saying that this is the worst animated video ever produced may be hard to  prove because there is some pretty stiff competition out there, but this  has to rank right down there with the bottom feeders.",945388800,,1075,4.456410256410257
7867891,4,6304244746,"This was a pretty good movie. The story and animation were great and the characters were very loveable. I particularly like Scarecrow (his voice was comicial in the fact that he sounded like an FBI agent.) The only problem I  had with it was too many unbelievable bits. Like people living under the  ocean, (how'd they breathe?) and the big thing that annoyed me was that  some of the female characters had male voices. It sounded a bit like Monty  Python after awhile. The songs might annoy you at first but then they'll  grow on you and you won't be able to get them out of your head. Apart from a  few minor things, like the voices and such, the whole movie was great and I  hope they do more with Mumfie.",944179200,,708,4.318181818181818
