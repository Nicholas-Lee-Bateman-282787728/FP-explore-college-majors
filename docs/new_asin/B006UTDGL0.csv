5020237,1,B006UTDGL0,it's selling for .28 cent that sums it up right there i over paid for these mess.,1413936000,,81,3.823529411764706
5020238,1,B006UTDGL0,"Don't even bother, I'm surprised how awful this movie was. A few recognizable stars are in it. It still did nothing for this movie.",1399766400,,131,4.5
5020239,3,B006UTDGL0,I watched and this was an ok.  There were funny parts and not so funny parts.  I did not care for Jackee acting like a loose woman especially around her daughters friends. I would not recommend to a younger audience.,1343692800,,216,4.375
5020240,4,B006UTDGL0,"I liked the movie it started out slow at first, but It got better. Good sit down and watch with friends or someone special!",1336521600,,123,4.166666666666667
5020241,5,B006UTDGL0,Thought it was a pretty good little comedy. Most small indies don't usually go this route. China and Harvey Blanks was hilarious,1335225600,2,128,4.863636363636363
5020242,5,B006UTDGL0,This was a very funny movie! I was unsure about buying it but I'm glad I did my husband and I laughed out loud. The cast was great! I will definitely be seeing this again and sharing with friends!.,1334188800,,197,4.076923076923077
5020243,5,B006UTDGL0,I loved this movie. It had some great comedy from everyone involved. The cinematography was gorgeous with many great establishing shots of the beautiful mansion the retreat was based at. The editing helped the story move fast with quite a few unique moments you don't normally see in a small independent film.,1331078400,4,309,4.961538461538462
5020244,2,B006UTDGL0,"Lonnie (Denyce Lawton) goes on a corporate retreat, one that Momma (Jacke Harry) approves because all the men have jobs. Bobby V plays her two timing boyfriend who uses her. Lonnie is joined by her co-workers in the HR department, China (Kanisha Buss) a heavy set woman with a tattoo on her left chest. She can't stop talking and thinks her boss Dan (who seems normal) is a sexual harasser. Also on the trip is the lovely Camilla (Veronica Rodriguez) who gets under utilized as they couldn't write a real part for her.

The ""comedy"" is geared toward African-American women and I didn't find it amusing and I don't think they will either.

One ""funny"" line was when they were looking at a Pez in a store. China says, ""Look it is a Camilla doll. All you have to do is wave your finger in front of it, it opens wide and you can get a piece."" Or at another time when China looks around the room and sees 20 men, ""Somebody is going to occupy China, tonight."" This is the type of low brow humor that was rampant in the film.

The acting was as lame as the dialouge. Later, there are far too many serious conversations. It turns from a bad comedy into a bad drama. The film had some low budget plot points. The company get together says it is 4 women and 20 men, however when they show the entire group, it is seven people. What company has 4 HR people for 20 employees and wouldn't they all know each other already?

Near f-bomb, extensive sex talk including vibrator, no sex or nudity.",1330732800,5,1480,4.332129963898917

8504727,1,B006UTDGL0,"This movie was absolutely terrible. The acting was subpar at most. I fell asleep during the movie, and dozed off again after waking up. Tried my hardest to finish it and finally did , but realized I would have done better making a PB&J sandwich than watching this tragedy of a romantic movie.",1472774400,,292,4.528301886792453
