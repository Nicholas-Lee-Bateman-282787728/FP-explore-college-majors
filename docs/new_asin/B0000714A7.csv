7973445,3,B0000714A7,"It's hard because it is being compared to Volume 1 which only focused on one artistic medium, painting and did an excellent job.  Volume 2 covers theater, sculpture, and photography and I think it does really good introductory job but is not as thorough as Volume 1.

Being that I am using it in an Art Appreciation course that covers painting, photography and sculpture (along with architecture) I didn't need the theatre episode but being a fan of Julie Taymor's productions it was a pleasant surprise.  Don't get me wrong I like all three episodes but I think the theater episode was the most thorough.  That being said I could still see at least one more episode from an actor's perspective on the subject.

Graves is really good with sculpture, but I have non-major students that I will be trying to introduce to Richard Serra, Andy Goldsworthy, Maya Lin, Claes Oldenburg, and the three greats (Michelangelo, Bernini, and Rodin).  Trying to link Graves to these different sculptors is a stretch.  Yes she challenges the sense of balance, but not like Serra.  Her sculptures look like they might fall apart but they're welded together unlike a Goldsworthy sculpture where nature is supposed to alter it.  Oldenburg and Lin have moved sculpture to an art form that can be soft and fluid.

Carrie Mae Weems' photography episode was a great introduction to photography, much better than I expected as usually people that videos about photography want to make them about the magic of exposure, which is valuable but the most important lesson for beginning photographers is composition.  Like I said this needs to be the first lesson and Weems does an excellent job of teaching composition, wouldn't expect less knowing her work.  It just needs follow up episodes that discuss exposure and the specifics of depth of field.",1392595200,,1821,4.915032679738562
7973446,5,B0000714A7,The Julie Taymor segment is wonderful (and pre-Lion King) l. I had it as a VHS. So happy that it is now on DVD.,1378339200,,111,3.6666666666666665
7973447,4,B0000714A7,"Bought this product because it was suggested as an essay source for a Photography class. We were to review only the photography section, and I will be using it in a first class of photography I teach as an introduction. There are two other sections to this DVD, Sculpting I know nothing about, but I do know quite a bit about Theatre. The theatre portion is lacking in structure, unlike the photography section.",1235779200,,411,4.6438356164383565
