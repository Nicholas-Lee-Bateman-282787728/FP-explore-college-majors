7425173,5,B014VVNZJ6,"Beverly and Derek Joubert's documentary about the African elephant captures the majesty and emotions of these magnificent animals. In an exquisitely photographed film their narration speaks to the fact that elephants are sentient, family oriented beings with emotions similar to humans in so many ways. Not only do they feel joy, playfulness, and fear, but have extraordinary memories and clearly mourn the loss of family members.  As conservationists, the Jouberts point out that the African elephant is on the brink of extinction in the wild due mainly to poaching, and that we must do everything possible to save the species, starting with the understanding that ivory belongs only to the elephants!!!",1457049600,5,704,5.342342342342342

7425176,5,B014VVNZJ6,"This is a a film put together in Botswana, Africa by a couple who make a living  filming and narrating wildlife documentaries.

They conclude  that: the pachyderms are highly intelligent; that use their trunk tips to gather all sort of information;  that with no predators, except poachers,  they are totally fearless; and in possession of a keen sense of smell  and with their trunks' tips can know the identity, from the flesh and/or bones, of dead elephants.

By the use of several cameras positioned in key sites where the giants would probably walk their takes, some of them underwater, are impressive, and quite interesting.

I myself have telepathically communicated with elephants and know the African creatures, like many other non-human/people, are sentient.

7425179,5,B014VVNZJ6,"This film is amazing, with photography that is beyond outstanding.  This film captures the exquisite beauty of these creatures, and of their tight and loyal family structures.  It must be recognized that we are animals as well, and as such are part of the entire animal family.  Every animals plays a part in the web of life, whether we recognize this or not.  The film is narrated by the Jouberts who have dedicated their lives to the photographing, and preserving the animals of Africa.  Preservation is vital, or we will face paradise lost.

7425180,5,B014VVNZJ6,"A German hunter apparently just paid $60,000 for killing a ""majestic"" 60-year-old elephant in Zimbabwe. The Zimbabwe Association of Safaris Operators (Zaso) said the elephant was the largest seen in Zimbabwe in 100 years. Its tusks, which were so large they almost touched the floor, weighed 120lbs. Now that is an individual living in a civilized society who enjoys killing wildlife instead of promoting wildlife. A German not a Chinese.

In September of 2015, Californias Governor, Jerry Brown signed AB96 a bill to close a loophole in the state's ban on importing, buying or selling elephant ivory or rhinoceros horns. San Francisco and Los Angeles make up two of the country's top three hubs for ivory sales. New York, which wildlife officials call the country's biggest ivory market, banned the sale of most elephant ivory, mammoth tusks and rhinoceros horns last year. California is a major market for ivory, and the ban would help dry up demand. The measure is aimed to end the state's exemption for selling ivory imported before 1977.

With some 35,000 elephants slaughtered every year for their tusks that mostly are shipped to China illegally, there would be no elephants left in few years, regardless. I have never seen so many wild huge elephants up-close within few feet of a camera, nor the most dangerous killer of all, hippos so close to humans. The images that filmmakers Dereck and Beverly Joubert have captured in this touching documentary about elephants are out of this world. It is a sad story to even consider that such a gentle animal will become extinct but if those proud citizens in NY and CA with their liberal beliefs did not protect the elephants till this last two summers by passing bills, then how in the world a communist country like China will stop their appetite for their criminal tradition of destroying many animals on this planet in the name of medicine or some other stupid beliefs that they have practiced for centuries with no regards for wildlife This is a very touching documentary about elephants and watching these giants up-close in a journey to their destination in Batswana, Africa __where 1/3 of worlds elephant population thrives with their bones and tusks untouched on the ground after their death__ will get to appreciate these gentle giants much, much more. And hopefully the message will get to China as well. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1444867200,15,2387,4.965

Masterfully filmed by Dereck Joubert and his beautiful wife Beverly who lived in remote parts of Africa for 30 years, this is well narrated (by both) and a very informative documentary about elephants. Reminded me of the great PBS Nova shows of the 1970's, but with the Joubert's unique style. Brought a tear to my eye several times but overall a positive movie.",1472860800,4,396,4.753623188405797
