2921554,3,B000UFLPMM,"Bruce Burgess is a journalist with time to kill and money to spend. When he's not a passenger in a Cessna skirting around Nellis Air Force Base (where Area 51 is located), or testing the legal boundaries with tepid attempts to penetrate Nevada airports, he is flying to Russia, leaning against barbed wire fences. His motto seems to be, ""This is as close as we could get.""

Now, I don't fault Burgess for trying. However, he shouldn't present his attemps and near-misses as ""proof"" of UFOs. Certainly, something strange seems to be going on in Area 51, but we can't quite say based on Burgess's evidence that whatever is going on is unearthly.

Before I critique some of Burgess's evidence, let me ask this question: If a flying saucer was discovered in Roswell in 1947, and if the U.S. Air Force has reverse engineered alien technology, why aren't we using it?

- Now, let's look at some of the so-called evidence presented. We get quite a lot of footage of grainy night skies with white dots and circles in the sky.

- We get some day time footage of white dots bouncing up and down in the sky.

- We get one very grainy, unresolved film clip of a thin, horizontal line moving from right to left, quickly, over a desert backdrop.

- We get one computer-enhanced short video clip of something shaped like a horizontal line moving across the sky from left to right.

- We get the ""flying canisters"".

- The best video clip comes from a news channel covering an anniversary celebration of some type held near Area 51. That clip was the most clear, most puzzling video of all of them in the film.

None of these video clips is very stable and well-focused. None show closeups. A white dot in the sky...so what?

Burgess shows a short vintage film clip of a 1950s era American made flying disk, that barely manages to stay more than two feet in the air. It looks more like a hovercraft. Also, it is still an aerodynamic vehicle, not really an anti-gravity vehicle. Burgess asks mysteriously, ""The Air Force scrapped the project 10 years later...they wouldn't say why."" Well, for starters, the thing could barely fly. When it did remain airborne, even I could have outrun it. No mention of this albatross making it above the stratosphere, much less into space.

Then there is Robert Lazar, who professes to have worked for a while at Area 51, then claims to have blown the whistle on a ""cover up."" We briefly get to see a copy of Lazar's W-2 form. His entire taxable income from the U.S. Navy was less than $1,000. How important could he have been? As another strange looking physicist Friedman notes, Lazar's story has the sound of a Walter Mitty.

Then, we hear from a woman who purportedly worked as an air traffic controller at Nellis. She is afraid for her safety, so they filmed her in silhouette. The joke of it is, we can still clearly see her, and her voice isn't altered at all. We see her hair, her double chin, her eyes, her eyebrows. She couldn't have been less mysterious had she walked into the room wearing a teddy from Victoria Secret. If I had ever worked with this woman at any time, I could easily tell you who she was. The filmmakers did very little to disguise her identity; it couldn't have been very important to begin with.

A lot of research obviously went into the production of this piece of journalism. Burgess is eager, intrepid, energetic and curious. He asks good questions. Unfortunately, it's not enough to satisfy me. By no means does he come remotely close to resolving long-standing questions about the existence of extra-terrestrials. He seems to extrapolate proof from evidence that is tenuous, at best, to absurdly specious at worst. I had learned absolutely nothing about aliens or alien craft. What I did learn was that Area 51 is a well-guarded secret, and things fly over it at night. But, we already know that!

I give it three stars for its entertainment value.",1190246400,8,3903,4.605187319884727

I worked at Area 51 in the mid-80s and I can discern that some of these guys only know what is common knowledge and are making the rest of it up. Still, it's an interesting tale simply because it's hilarious to laugh out loud at some of the nonsense being spouted.

8213133,3,B000UFLPMM,"A few days ago, an old friend of mine posted on Facebook he was giving away several movies he no longer wanted for one reason or another. It just so happens that Dreamland was one of those movies that I got from him. I'm into the alien and ufo thing so I told myself, why not. So I came home and last night popped the movie into my laptop.

It came out in the mid-90s and I have to admit that I had to have a chuckle at the primitive-looking computer generated images used for demostrative scenes. As for the documentary itself, all in all there were three things that made up the documentary: interviews, old alleged UFO footage, and the people working on the documentary trying to check out Area 51 firsthand.

I think the man behind the documentary was essentially/primarily trying to prove that there are unearthly things happening or have happened at Area 51. Much of the film was primarily interviews from people who were once employed by Area 51. I thought the interviews were the best part of the documentary. Some of the amateur footage, which were recorded in the 80s and early 90s, were sadly are not really worth seeing as you don't really see that much in the footage anyway.

All in all, I thought the documentary was alright. If you're into the whole field and have interest in UFOs and Area 51, then I think it's at least worth a look.",1286150400,,1351,4.439516129032258
8213134,5,B000UFLPMM,"This film is by far the best documentary on the subject of Groom Lake that I have ever seen.  I got it new for only a dollar and was surprised at how much evidence the director sites for the claims that are made in the film.  The quality of the editing was so so, however the content of the personal interviews and the amount of factual evidence were compelling.  This documentary does not make you say ""well now I believe it all"", but it does challenge the long held belief that nothing out of this world happens at Groom Lake.",1260835200,,528,4.26
8213135,3,B000UFLPMM,"The Psychedelic Shaman writes, above:

The filmmakers did very little to disguise her identity; it couldn't have been very important to begin with.""

How nice it must be to speak about someone else, tacky comments about a Victoria's Secret teddy notwithstanding, from your own comfortable little reality untroubled by personal experiences that you can't ignore, that allow you to (un)intellectually discuss points in a video from your own lack of experience, pretending you have the knowledge required to dispense something that's supposed to pass for wisdom, or at the very least, a review.

I agree with the points made about being able to see who I was and about anyone who knows me being able to identify me from seeing this video.  Several friends and acquaintances of mine have asked me in the ensuing years, ""Was that you in that UFO show?""  I affirm that it was indeed me.  Oh, and BTW, I was not an air traffic controller... I was an auto-track radar specialist.

I do not agree that ""it couldn't have been very important to begin with."" The shabby, pathetic job that Burgess did ""hiding"" my identity was tantamount to me being re-traumatized and terrorized after I'd already had far enough of that.  I was furious and terrified.  I did no more interviews and disappeared from any form of media for over 12 years as a result.  I might have taken legal action against him if that would not have blown my true identity even further out into the world, which I wanted to avoid at all costs.  The original trauma was enough anguish to deal with, and the way my interview was done in this video was another dose of it on top of the first.

I wouldn't be writing this now if I had not cautiously begun coming forward myself in the past year.

That having been said, returning to some kind of objective review of this dvd, I will say it has some good material to offer, if one is doing an in-depth research project of their own on the UFO cover-up and connects the dots with lots of other material out there.  I'm not happy with the way my interview was handled one bit, or with the spooky presentation overall, but some good information does manage to get in there.

And as to Bob Lazar, the one time I met him he struck me as a man who spends a great deal of time nervously looking over his shoulder.  Since I know firsthand what that is like, I tend to believe that his story is genuine as well, and points of it I've heard over time intersect with points in my own.

If you really want to see a good documentary, I recommend ""Fastwalkers"" or, if you have access to Google Video, ""The Disclosure Project Witness Testimony"" video, or anything with Robert Dean or Clifford Stone.  When I see the beads of sweat on former General Lovekin's brow in the Disclosure Project video, I know exactly what those are about too.

Extraterrestrials and their presence and contact with factions of our government is real.  Those of us who have experienced this firsthand try to tell people this.  I know it's a tough idea to really digest and accept.  But for those of us who are the experiencers, we don't have the luxury of denying it anymore.  The public at large would do well to seriously consider what we have to say and enlarge their view of God or the Creator to include that God's universe is a big place and contains more life, including sentient life, than we see before us on a regular basis on Earth.  Enough said, here and now.",1229385600,4,3922,4.476123595505618
8213136,3,B000UFLPMM,"Dreamland was a British made documentary (narrated by Bruce Burgess) from 1996 regarding Area 51 in Nevada. I presume this was originally released on VHS (since of course, the DVD was introduced late that year in Japan, and elsewhere in 1997). At least this DVD is very inexpensive, but if you've watched your share of other UFO documentaries, subjects on Area 51, and listened to Art Bell's radio program through the years, this all sounds familiar. You get to hear interviews from the likes of Stanton Friedman and Bob Lazar. Lazar has long been discredited by many, including Friedman himself (he even does so on this documentary, especially when Friedman stated that Lazar is taking security issues way too lightly), but you get to hear Lazar stating he worked at Groom Lake at the end of the 1980s back-engineering alien technology to test fly flying saucers. Of course there are many who felt his records during his stay in Area 51 and Los Alamos were purposely erased, including George Knapp of KLAS in Las Vegas, who broke the Lazar story. On a side note, I do admire Stanton Friedman greatly, he is quite credible, and he don't go off on kooky theories to support his belief in UFOs. You also get to hear stories from people who preferred to be anonymous, including this guy who claimed to work with a Grey called J-Rod. It turns out this guy was none other than Bill Uhouse (there's a guy who looks much like him on the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the guy who said he wants something so scary it would ""clear three hundred square miles of every living Christian soul"". Of course the guy on the movie isn't Bill Uhouse, but looks like him), I've seen plenty of footage of him elsewhere completely non-anonymous talking about his stay at Area 51 and of J-Rod, and you couldn't mistake his silhouette on this documentary. You get plenty of footage of various U.S. military officials talking about Area 51, plus the occasional British point of view, like Nick Pope of the Ministry of Defence (the UK version of the Department of Defense) and other British figures as Timothy Good, Nick Cook, and Bill Sweetman, many of them working for Jane's Defence Weekly, a British military publication. Bruce Burgess also wants to drive home to point of how tight security is at Area 51 by flying a plane close to the restricted zone and having fighter jets fly close by to chase them off, and driving on a dirt road showing signs that explicitly say, ""Use of deadly force authorized"". Plus you hear plenty of stories of how many people were threatened in every degree if they didn't keep shut about the base, and of course, every fan of conspiracies will not disappoint here!

I have to say it isn't bad, and it's nice to see the British do their stab at a documentary regarding Area 51, but I really didn't think I came out of this learning much more I hadn't seen on other documentaries or Art Bell. At least it's very inexpensive, so you never felt you overpaid.",1191283200,5,2974,4.621928166351607
