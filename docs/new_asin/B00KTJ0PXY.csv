8661412,5,B00KTJ0PXY,"We used this for our 9th grader and it has been excellent. The lectures are presented in an interesting way, with pictures also. The readings are excellent as well! The projects allow students who may not test well to shine in the projects which are great learning tools as well. One of the best American history options available!",1439251200,,331,4.724137931034483
8661413,3,B00KTJ0PXY,"Just received my ""course"". I haven't unwrapped it yet, but a bit disappointed that the ""readings"" and tests are in PDF and need to be downloaded and printed. Messy and considerable additional time and effort. Wish the description were clearer.",1430870400,4,243,5.1
8661414,5,B00KTJ0PXY,"Great artwork accompanies short lectures.  Great instructions.  Love that he tells you how to organize your work, take notes, and take clues to most important points.  I'm learning as I sit with my kids!  Using with 12 and 14 year old for HS American History.",1426636800,5,259,4.688888888888889
8661415,5,B00KTJ0PXY,"We use this DVD course in our homeschool with my 7th-grade daughter. We watch it together and, as the parents, we're getting the history lessons we WISH we'd had in public school! It is from a Christian perspective, but our family is not Christian and haven't had a problem with that. Dave Raymond is very entertaining as well as knowledgeable, and we like that the readings for each lesson are from original texts, not a summary of original sources. The tests require a lot of writing and narrating the lives of historical characters, which fits in well with the classical homeschool model we're using. Highly recommended.",1423785600,4,623,4.886792452830188
