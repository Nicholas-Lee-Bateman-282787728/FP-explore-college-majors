The instruction & detail is great in here, the extras have a quick ""chalk outline"" that shows the most popular wrong things people do that I found concise & succinct & informative.
Natasha has great strength, flexibility & does move like a ballerina almost during her demonstration, but still looked stiff with little body awareness of energy.
Her instruction is great & in depth, 90% western, muscle only instruction, she said the fear of crane/crow is mostly out of  fear & is easier then you think which is true.
I did find the video to be too stiff for me, the instruction didn't flow and felt very long & boring. That's why I don't give it 5 stars, but the in-depth teaching of these harder poses are harder to find on dvds, hence the 4 stars.
The extra by having the doctor talk about the medical benefits of yoga really killed me in monotony. I learned better benefits from Wai Lana, Shiva Rea, Gaiam's Rodney Yee, Rainbeau Mars, Seane Corn (great detailed instruction, better analogies, more flow, etc.), etc.

You can see a clip on youtube com of her Vol. 1 if you look up ""Learn Yoga - Downward Facing Dog""",1193788800,,1151,4.528846153846154

This DVD is for students of yoga who have mastered the first two instructional sessions. I'd consider myself to be intermediate and the workout on this DVD seemed to be more advanced than any workout I've tried so far. It is a challenging and healing workout that may be enjoyed by intermediate yoga students who are looking for challenging balance poses that increase your focus and energy.

Natasha Rizopoulos has a beautiful teaching style that allows you to fully experience the body mind connection. She encourages you to experience yoga in order to balance your life. After watching her Yoga demonstration you may start to think of Yoga as an art form and not just an exercise routine. She turns yoga into ballet and her upper body strength is astounding. Upper body strength will be especially important in this DVD.

During the handstand section, I had a good giggle because I could not get upside down on the first few tries and then my feet made a rather loud noise as I finally was up against the wall. I think I may have startled the neighbors. On subsequent attempts, I was able to get upside down more easily when I used a little momentum. While upside down I could really feel the weight of my body and some of the exercises may be slightly wrist intensive if you have not been doing yoga for a few years.

I'd ""highly"" recommend buying two beveled foam yoga blocks (if you have yet to buy them) along with this DVD. Modifying the balancing poses with props is advised and if you can have someone workout out with you, I'd highly recommend having someone assist you as you try the inverted poses. I was able to manage on my own, but could see where having someone around would be helpful.

This DVD has interesting menu options. There are really two main parts:

A 35 minute Instruction Session - You explore the postures in depth
20 minutes of uninterrupted flowing practice - a vigorous vinyasa flow sequence

You can follow the Instruction Menu, Practice Menu, go straight to the Yoga Chalk Talk (a great way to explore the poses) or Medical Commentary. The Practice menu has four sections:

Begin Practice (Different from Begin Instruction)
Follow Jason - This is an excellent option if you want to use props like blocks.
Practice with Medical Commentary
Practice without Music

Natasha Rizopoulos teaches you about how to use a wall to assist with balancing upside down. She gives safety tips and modifications. This is the third DVD in a series of three high-quality yoga packages. You will need blocks and a mat. Even after years of yoga practice, it is exciting to find out there is so much more to learn. This is a must-have series for anyone who is interested in yoga.

I personally think this is intermediate to advanced or can be done by individuals with good upper body strength and balance.

8011052,5,B0001DMXD8,I love this video series.  It breaks down step by step the asanas(poses)so you can do them correctly.  I attend a yoga studio and the instructor doesnt have time to go by and see that everyone is doing a pose correctly.  If you don't do a pose correctly you can hurt yourself.  This video is a great addition to my home practice and compliments my studio practice.,1102723200,,364,4.388059701492537
