This is a good video to watch if you don't feel up to the 4 hour 'AMERICAN EXPERIENCE - TEDDY ROOSEVELT' PBS HOME VIDEO. In fairness to 'Theodore Roosevelt: Roughrider to Rushmore', A&E has packed quite alot of history into 50 minutes. The following topics are touched on;

- THE ROUGH RIDERS

- THE PANAMA CANAL

- THE CONSERVATION MOVEMENT

- TR's 'TRUST-BUSTING' LITIGATIONS AGAINST BIG BUSINESS, including J.P. MORGAN

- NY STATE ASSEMBLY - POLICE COMMISSIONER - GOVERNOR - VP - PRESIDENT, & MORE

It is probably impossible to find out more about T.R. in 50 minutes than through this excellent and historically accurate video. Nevertheless, I would still recommend viewing the 'AMERICAN EXPERIENCE - TEDDY ROOSEVELT' PBS HOME VIDEO, if you want to see more about his early years and family/personal life.

BOTTOM LINE: THE FLAVOR OF T.R. CLEARLY COMES ACROSS

This film imparts one with the sense that T.R. was much more than a carricature. A very decent man, T.R. may have been the first President to actively attempt social reform and universal fairness in a big way and paved the way for others to follow and go further.",1156809600,13,1196,4.823529411764706
