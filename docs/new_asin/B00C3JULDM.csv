5689919,5,B00C3JULDM,"I will NOT post any spoilers here, but the DVD is solid gold. The series is priceless, and the single best way I've ever seen to teach kids about the Bible. Vol. 11 goes through the heavy Book of Acts, addressing the apostles' post-Ascension actions in the first half and the Saul/Paul story in Part Two.  (If you consider those ""spoilers"", you need this show more than I thought!)

Buck Denver (Man of News!), Ian and his explorer brother Clive [Cleans Little Iguanas Very Efficiently] and their friends walk kids and adults alike through the Book of Acts with songs, humor, and a serious dedication to explaining What's In The Bible.  While most kids' shows and books tend to soft-peddle the tougher stuff in the Bible, Mr. Vischer doesn't pull any punches about the hard items in Acts.  He explains flogging, mentions that sometimes God heals and sometimes He doesn't; and points out that Peter was released from prison, but that James was executed. The story of Acts is a complex one, and the WITB crew manage to hit all the points, even giving a nod to Indiana Jones' way of mapping the world, Paul-style.  Hilarious, solid teaching, and a terrific way to make the Book of Acts jump off the page and bound around your living room!

One minor complaint: They recycled one of the ""Pirate's Guide To Church History"" bits from a prior DVD. These are great segments: Highly creative, educational, and well-written for kids to gain a bit of insight into extrabiblical history.  (The Da Vinci Toad?  Died laughing.)  There's enough church history out there to sink a thousand ships, so I can only surmise that funding must be tight for them to start re-using these.  Still the best DVD on Acts for kids that I've ever seen, and after 11 of these, Phil Vischer is still creative and uproariously funny.  THAT takes a gifting, so go buy this and watch it with some kids somewhere. It will make your day.",1368057600,9,1899,4.655688622754491
5689920,5,B00C3JULDM,This is the first video of the series that I've bought by the creator of Veggie Tales.  Good quality and educational.  I will buy more in this series.,1367712000,,150,4.321428571428571
5689931,5,B00C3JULDM,"We have all of these DVDs.  My children love to watch them in the car on trips to grandparents.  My husband and I even find ourselves listening to the information and learning something new.  Beware - some of the songs will stick in your head ALL DAY LONG!  Our 5 year old has watched the videos since she was 2 and has enjoyed them at every stage.  As she gets older she discovers and understands more of the information and humor... so she can definitely grow with these DVDs.  Our second child is starting out on the same path of loving them, too.",1452643200,,550,4.29126213592233

5689933,4,B00C3JULDM,"The Buck Denver series are fantastic!
Not only do my kids learn, but the adults watching it along with them are learning, too! They really help to explain the background, history, locations, culture and so forth - of the book/books/Biblical accounts that it's speaking of. My aim is to eventually own them all. It's a bit of an investment, but for my kids to understand God's word and be excited about it... What greater thing could you do for your kids? The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I personally think the characters are a bit outdated. I'm surprised the whole thing is not done using cute cartoon characters. Puppets seem a bit old school Sunday School to me. They still get the message across... And for now, my kids seem engaged, but in my mind, it seems more people would be attracted with a different look to the whole thing.",1440720000,,860,4.484076433121019
5689934,5,B00C3JULDM,This is something my Sunday School class always enjoys when we have video time. There are enough changes in the characters' action that keeps 3 - 5 year olds interested. The Bible stories are well done. I have purchased several including on Kindle to show in in class.,1439510400,,268,4.604166666666667

5689936,4,B00C3JULDM,"Its been a long time since a volume of Whats in the Bible? focused on just one book of the Bible, but thats the case with Volume 11  Spreading The Good News!  This video covers just the book of Acts.  Of course, there is lots of material to cover, so this hour video is not boring.

As always Phil Vischer and his stable of puppets take us through the events of the book.  Weve got the coming of the Holy Spirit and the power He gives (no, not like superheroes), the founding of the church, persecution, and the spreading of the Gospel.  And thats just in the first half.  The second half hour covers Paul and his conversion and his missionary journeys.

But thats not all.  The video also manages to get in discussions on science versus miracles and why God protects some but not others.  Both of these discussions seemed light to me at first, but then I put myself in the shoes of the target age group.  Elementary kids will understand what is being said and will learn from it.  Just because Imolderand have heard these issues discussed before, I cant judge this video by everything Ive heard.  What is said here is true and solid and will get kids thinking.  Thats the most important thing.

Even with only covering one book, this video does seem a bit drier than some of the others.  Dont get me wrong, there are plenty of exciting things happening here, but it is a bit more of a straightforward retelling of the book than some of the others.  There is one cool moment when they compare Pauls missionary journey to crossing the United States.  That really puts his travels into perspective and is something everyone will benefit from.

When you get this gang of puppets together, there is bound to be some antics.  As usual, I enjoyed Clive and Ians antics, specifically their guess definition of Gentiles (and then trying to justify it).  They also keep making funny references to superheroes, mostly Spiderman.  And yet that doesnt come up with host Buck Denver fears that attempts to spice up the second half will include eating bugs.  Yes, its silly, but its fun, and kids especially will love it.

At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I must once again pick on the songs.  They are the weakest part of the show.  Honestly, if they were left out entirely I wouldnt mind.

On the whole, this is a good mix of story and what it means, which is exactly what weve come to expect from Whats in the Bible?  Watch these in order, and when you get to Spreading The Good News! youll marvel at how God worked out the next part of His rescue plan.",1430092800,,2555,4.436559139784946
5689937,5,B00C3JULDM,"excellent, informative product . Blessings to the producers for making such a entertaining, accurate, and helpful series which translates Biblical content for audiences in a reverent, yet fun way. very worth-while to purchase for our children (and families).",1421798400,,258,5.815789473684211

5689940,5,B00C3JULDM,"What happens to Jesus followers? Who is this Helper Jesus says He will send? How did the Gospel start to spread? This is covered in the book of Acts, the New Testament's history book.

Episode 1 focuses on the Holy Spirit and Pentecost, and Episode 2 focuses on Paul. Both episodes are about 25 minutes long, and a lot is packed into both of them.

It also deals with questions, like, Does science tell us miracles are impossible? and What is science? Vischer excels at using analogies and he uses a good one here about a thermometer and using the right tool for a job.

This DVD's back cover has an endorsement from Money Saving Mom Crystal Paine on the back cover, joining endorsements from Max Lucado and Francis Chan, which have been on every cover.",1418342400,,753,4.522058823529412
5689960,5,B00C3JULDM,"What's in the Bible is the BEST.  Accurate, educational, entertaining and, my personal favorite- MEMORABLE.  The whole family loves these DVDs (kids are 6, 8, and 15-- and the 15 year old enjoys them too- we all enjoy watching them together).  But my favorite thing is, how my kids REMEMBER and think what they see on the dvd, and make connections from it. The most recent example of this was my 8 year old learned a bit about Billy Graham, who is talked about at a point in this dvd.  My kids have learned about many Historical Christians (now in Heaven), so when I told my 8 yr old that Billy Graham is still alive, he was so excited.  It rabbit-trailed into us looking up Billy Graham online, and then his son (Frankin), and seeing how that tied into a family tradition of ours- shoe boxes for Franklin Graham's Operation Christmas Child.  These videos are just so well done, and we really appreciate them.  Worth the $$, no question.",1415577600,,937,4.508875739644971
5689961,5,B00C3JULDM,"These are really enjoyable.  My son is 30 (not a child).  I have pretty good Bible knowledge for a layman, yet I loved these.  I have watched most of them.  I love his clear take on summarizing the Bible.",1412985600,,204,4.153846153846154
5689962,5,B00C3JULDM,"As a mom of four children -- 7yo twins, a 5yo, and a 4yo -- I've been very impressed with the What's in the Bible series. It doesn't replace reading the stories you find in every children's Bible. Instead, it builds on those stories: 1) explaining how each part of the Bible fits into God's Rescue Plan, and 2) giving a kid-size foundation for thinking through hard questions about the Bible in future years. The explanations don't seem dogmatic, but honest, intellectual, and full of faith.

One of these DVDs is usually playing while I'm chauffeuring to and from activities (which makes the puppet character in the car seat that much more funny). This DVD about Acts is probably the favorite for all the kids.

My 4yo is the only one still home, so he sees them the most -- and he tells stories from this DVD all day long! ""I want to see Paul fall down and become blind! Then God tells him to go to Damascus, and he did. There was a boy there named Ananias. And when Ananias put his hands on Paul, he could see. Then he was a follower of Jesus!"" He knows that before this, Paul was ""throwing Jesus' followers in prison."" He likes to tell the story of Paul telling King Agrippa about Jesus. I'm writing this review today because he just announced to me that Paul traveled to Berea, Macedonia, and Jerusalem. I quizzed him a little, and he added Caesarea, Rome, Apollonia, Damascus, Derbe, Troas, Thessalonica, and Ptolemais! (Of course, then he said Paul traveled to these places by airplane, except when he had to go by motorboat... The DVD does say he walked!)

From this DVD, he can tell me that science is the wrong tool to learn about God -- we learn about God through the Bible and testimony. (The song on the DVD uses the word ""revelation"" for the Bible.) He also tells me that God doesn't ""do"" all of our prayers, but he ""answers"" all of them. This is his way of summing up the section about why God saved Paul from death but not Stephen.

The only downside is that now he regularly yells, ""I appeal to Caesar!"" and I have to give him the bad news that he is not a Roman citizen and still has to do what I said! -- In spite of this, I highly recommend the whole series!",1412208000,3,2178,4.343980343980344

5689986,4,B00C3JULDM,Vischer has done a great job with this.  It is entertaining without dumbing down the Message.

5690014,5,B00C3JULDM,"My kids have learned so much from the What's in the Bible series. In fact, even my Father-in-Law and I have learned an awful lot. For young kids, it gives a platform for understanding some pretty deep concepts in a very approachable way.
For older kids, the humor entices them to understand more about historical, spiritual truths within.
Everything from the books of the Bible to evil/good kings.
I knew my kids were hooked when my 8 year old started telling me about the ritual and ethical laws; My response was, ""Honey, you're going to have to define that for me."" What kid could understand that concept? Any kid who watches as Buck Denver humerously learns these things himself.

Many of the quotes from the What's in the Bible series become part of our own family humor.
 ""Septuegent""....""Bless you""
""Caffeine, Nature's gas pedal""",1370563200,,835,4.8321678321678325
5690015,5,B00C3JULDM,"My family have been long-time fans of the Veggietales series and now have thoroughly enjoyed the What's in the Bible series. As a Christian Mom, I'm always looking for ways to help my kids understand and learn more about the Bible - and to foster an interest in learning more and digging in for themselves! We own the first 10 of these dvd's and were very excited about Vol. 11 about Acts.

The dvd kept the interest of my kids, age 11 and 7, who have followed the whole series. My 3 year old is a little too young to really ""get"" the concepts but she does enjoy the songs and  silly (sometimes) characters. It doesn't hold her interest as much yet. But, my 7 and 11 year olds enjoyed this one a lot - and liked the discussion around people who try to say that Science makes the Bible obsolete...I appreciated the definition of Science and explanation that God is from a supernatural (Beyond nature) realm. It was a bit ""deep"" but fostered a great discussion with my kids. I also personally really like the ""Tricky bits"" sections where the cute puppet actors (which are not as cheesy as that sounds - they are pretty funny) ask questions that might come up in discussion about what they're learning in the books of the Bible. This time, the discussion was around that age old question ""Why does God let bad things happen to good people?"" - definitely relevant in the world and time we live in. It definitely has a Christian bent - and will be more of an ""educational"" type video with some fun songs, etc, built in to engage the kids.  I grew up in a Christian home, with a private Christian education - and I've still learned a lot from this series myself! I think it's great for the whole family - and a good starter for discussions. I'd say that a newcomer to the What's in the Bible series would do best starting at Volume 1 and going through the whole series, but Volume 11 could even be a standalone viewing and the viewer would ""get it"" and not be ""lost"".

We can't wait for Volume 12 to come out!",1368662400,3,2003,4.347593582887701
