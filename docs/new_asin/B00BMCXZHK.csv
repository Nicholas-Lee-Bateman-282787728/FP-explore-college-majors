8570758,1,B00BMCXZHK,"The information depicted through the actors is inaccurate such as, during  hand washing the actor rinses hands by rubbing them together and  rinsing  under the  water which is incorrect technique, wearing gloves while recording patient information (infection control issue).  I stopped before the first 6-minutes was finished because I can't use this for training d/t the many inaccuracies seen just for hand washing.  I do not recommend this video for training purposes if you do purchase it and find it doesn't meet your needs make sure you return it within 30 days or you will be stuck with it.",1434412800,,597,4.97979797979798
