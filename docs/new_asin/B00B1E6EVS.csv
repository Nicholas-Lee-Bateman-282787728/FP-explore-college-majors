8560715,3,B00B1E6EVS,It's NOVA. The film is mostly speculation and not so much evidence. not something I'd really recommend. It's not so much your documentary but people looking for answers. I'd rate the film between two and three stars. You can ask your local library to order a copy if you would like to see it.,1487462400,,292,4.425925925925926
8560716,4,B00B1E6EVS,"Profiler rules on most of the conspiracy Theory.

This starts with one of the best retired FBI profilers around as the lead investigator. He goes back to the actual home where  Baby Charlie was actually kidnapped. He then interviews several conspiracy theory authors who have written books on the event. He goes to the crime museum where actual documents are stored. He has a forensic computer handwriting expert who puts his thoughts in. End results: Bruno Richard Hauptmann did it. Based on the hand writing, ladder made of matching boards from his attic and money from the kidnapping in his home. Added to the theory is the baby was intentionally murdered to keep him quiet since a living toddler would be hard to hide. This resulted in a national law involving kidnappings. Additional theory is a MAID ""may have given out information on when the Lindbergh's would be at the home""...Added information is a possible link between a neighbor from the same town in Germany Hauptmann was from may have been involved but this was speculation. Seeing the actual home that looks about the same. The over all summary is that Hauptman used a ladder in a previous crime in Germany before he moves to the USA as a stowaway. He was a carpenter and used the wood from his attic that matched the ladder used in the crime and found near the Lindburgh home perfectly. Questions still remain IF he actually wrote the ransom note. ADDED speculation was that Lindbergh was a control freak, this added to the chaos and confusion of the events after the kidnapping. This was interesting. My simple questions are ...how did the kidnapper(s) know the exact room the baby slept in and how did that window lock 'just happened"" to be UNLOCKED in March when the baby had a cold and there would be no way the window would have been opened for any reason. I give it 4 STARS~",1484006400,,1847,4.662576687116564
8560717,3,B00B1E6EVS,"This NOVA episode's somewhat bait and switch title may have been used to generate interest in a nearly century old crime of the most vile sort. It's not hard to imagine that Charles Lindbergh Jr. died in his room, intentionally murdered to prevent any noise that would alert his sleeping parents to a snatching under way.

The most controversial exculpatory evidence was never made public by lead investigator Herbert Schwatzkopf (father of Gulf War general Norman), that the ladder used in committing the act had no fingerprints on it. Yet this can be explained away. After the supposed perpetrator, Bruno Hauptmann constructed the ladder he wiped it clean then never touched it again without wearing gloves.

That Hauptmann chose to die rather than admit guilt proves little. Maybe he WAS the killer, accidentally or on purpose, and didn't want to live with such a burden. It's all highly speculative as is this glacier encrusted cold case examination.",1483315200,,954,5.070063694267516
8560718,3,B00B1E6EVS,"I so wanted to believe that Hauptmann was not guilty.  I have read about a dozen books about the crime and its investigation, and agree with Kennedy that there were so many flaws, that Hauptmann was not represented fairly by Reilly, and that just common sense would indicate that faced with the certainty of electrocution Hauptmann would either confess to his part or identify others, to either save his life or at least to gain money for his widow and child when offered a vast sum to confess or help.  But subsequent tests by many experts have now pretty clearly identified the board taken from the garage as having been used in the construction of the ladder,whereas the testimony at the time by the expert was suspect.  So, Kennedy's version was just as subject to criticism as many of the books and articles written in support of the verdict and non-commutation.  The writer plays quite loose with the facts, to serve his own views.",1416355200,,937,4.695121951219512
8560719,2,B00B1E6EVS,"You won't find any answers to the question posed by the title in this NOVA production.  In fact, you won't even get an unbiased  and certainly not a comprehensive  look at all of the aspects of this case.  I have to say Ive lost a good bit of respect for John Douglas after watching his investigation of the Lindbergh kidnapping and murder case.  Douglas, of course, is essentially the best-known criminal profiler in America.  Ive read and been impressed by several of his books; in fact, Douglas books had done much to improve my opinion on criminal profiling.  This presentation of the Lindbergh investigation, though, has only reinforced my original opinion that criminal profiling has more than a few major bits of hokum associated with it.  In this case, Hauptmann happens to match Douglas profile of someone capable of committing this crime, so he ignores any evidence that Hauptmann was innocent  and, unfortunately, this type of bias goes on to further undermine Douglas whole argument.  Douglas isn't looking for the Lindberg kidnapper(s)  hes looking for suspects who fit his profile of the criminals.

So lets start with Hauptmann.  Whatever the truth of his story as to how some of the ransom money came into his possession, it should at least be heard  but you won't hear it here.  You also won't hear anything about how Lindbergh himself and the mysterious Dr. Condon (Lindberghs go-between with the alleged kidnappers) suddenly changed their testimony at the trial to directly implicate Hauptmann as Cemetery John, the man who took the ransom money from Condon.  Personally, I don't think you can believe anything Condon ever said, but we know that Lindbergh lied on the stand about the man whom he heard say just two words.  In his grand jury testimony, Lindbergh said he barely heard Cemetery John whisper the words Hey, doctor to Dr. Condon (which makes sense, given that Lindberg was sitting in a closed car some three hundred feet away), yet he positively identified hearing the voice of Hauptmann at the trial (just as Condon identified Hauptmann as Cemetery John, despite have failed to pick him out of a lineup following his arrest).  You won't hear a word about how Hauptmanns attorney Ed Reilly was basically in cahoots with the prosecutors to ensure Hauptmann was convicted; his defense of his client (whom he barely even met before the trial) was basically no defense at all.  You certainly won't hear any mention of the discoveries made about the trial over the years  pressured and perjured witnesses, planted evidence, police corruption, political shenanigans, etc.  Anyone who knows anything about this circus of a trial knows that it was a total farce  except John Douglas, apparently.  He even argues that Hauptmanns refusal to confess or name co-conspirators, even when offered either money or his own life, came down to an attempt to lessen the stain on the family name in the interests of his son.

Instead of addressing the dubious facts of the case, Douglas spends much of his time going off on tangents.  He keeps going back to a man named John Knowles, based solely on one mans report of his fathers reported memory of hearing Knowles mention the word Englewood (Lindberghs wifes family estate) in discussion with two other men, one of whom was named Bruno.  Bruno Richard Hauptmann never even went by the name of Bruno, and computer forensic analysis shows that neither Knowles nor Hauptmann wrote the ransom letters, yet a complete lack of evidence doesnt stop Douglas from trying as hard as he can to make Knowles a co-conspirator with Hauptmann.

The part of the documentary that will really bother many viewers is the suggestion that Lindbergh himself was involved in the kidnapping.  Douglas speaks to Rutgers historian Lloyd C. Gardner about his theory that Lindberghs strong commitment to eugenics led him to have his son (who may have suffered from a mild case of rickets) done away with).  This theory has virtually no legs to stand on  although I actually do believe there is reason to at least be suspicious of Lindbergh given some of the strange actions he took in the wake of the kidnapping.  As for Douglas, convinced as he is that someone inside the house had to have colluded with the kidnappers, he falls back on the tried-and-true fingering of Lindberg maid Violet Sharpe (once again, with no evidence to support the charge).

Who Killed Lindbergh's Baby? represents criminal profiling at its worst, with the investigator ignoring any evidence that gets in the way of making his profile fit the purported criminal.  No one should accept Douglas conclusions without taking a much more extensive look at the actual evidence for and against Bruno Richard Hauptmans guilt.",1411084800,7,4728,4.944303797468354
8560720,1,B00B1E6EVS,It went south when they brought in some crackpot saying he believes Charles Lindbergh Sr. mastermind the kidnapping.  Presented no real additional evidence.,1376265600,3,156,5.782608695652174
8560721,4,B00B1E6EVS,"The famous 1932 kidnapping of the son of Charles A. Lindberg has fascinated folks for years and there have been many books.  ""Charlie"" - the ""baby"" was just 20 months. The accused kidnapper - Bruno Richard Hauptmann was found guilty (and acted alone) and was executed.

This 54-minute NOVA episode takes another look at the case and uses a retired FBI ""profiler"" to visit the Lindbergh Estate (which still stands in Hopewell, NJ) to investigate whether Hauptman could have acted alone and whether the kidnapping was arranged -in fact - by Lindbergh himself! There are interviews with the author of ""Kidnap"" - a book on the case - and another retired detective. But much of the show is filled with ""recreations"" as well as archival footage (nearly equal amounts of both). This show will appeal to those who have long been fascinated with the case but - as with similar show - no actual conclusion can be drawn from the evidence shown and no one is re-opening the case.
As is usual for Nova shows, the quality is high. There are no bonus features/

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
