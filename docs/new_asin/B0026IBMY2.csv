3853641,5,B0026IBMY2,"I LOVE this show! I've been waiting years to see the final season and have not given in to bootleg copies to see it!

I'm keeping my fingers crossed that this set of 9 episodes is officially realeased!",1244505600,8,201,4.2894736842105265
3853642,5,B0026IBMY2,"I really enjoy X-Men: Evolution and when I found out that season 4 will be it's final season, I was completly upset about it. The first three season's got me totally addicted at the time, but it talked about each character that came into play and their backgrounds. This season had more action and we got to see characters from the comics like Omega Red, Gambit, Apocalypse and the four horsemen.

  Episode 44- Impact: Begain where last season ended, after Apocaplypse crippled both heroes and enemies, he decided to launch his attack on the world where he created spears all around the globe. Magneto decided to launch a full scale attack on the mega mutant but was destroyed as the X-Men helplessly watched.

  Episode 45- No Good Deed: After Wanda caused the accident in the subway the Brotherhood saved a few people getting them recognized they became heroes, making the X-Men completly upset. So the Brotherhood causes accidents and save people along the way just trying to get famous and noticed.

  Episode 46- Target X: Wolverine is hunted by two mutants bent on revenge as X-23 returns to help out an old friend as they both team up to take down Hydra.

  Episode 47- Sins of the Son: Xavier is reunited with a son he never knew existed and is faced with a crisis.

  Episode 48- Uprising: A War is raged against Mutants causing Spike to get furious and retaliate which the X-Men intervene.

  Episode 49- Cajun Spice: Rogue assist Remy to Louisianna and is confronted from his old posse who took his father hostage.

  Episode 50- Ghost of a Chance: Kitty gets into an accident and meets a young girl named Danielle Moonstar who has the ability to alter reality.

  Episode 51- Ascension pt. 1: Apocalpypse rages war on both mutant and humans alike and it is up to the X-men to assemble a team to take on this greater threat.

  Episode 52- Ascension pt. 2: The X-men, The Brotherhood and enemies and heroes from the past episodes team up to take on the four horsemen of the Apocalypse.

  I hope they come up with a DVD for season 4 of the X-Men: Evolution because this show was the only cartoon that I would watch whenever it was on I have all the episodes but this is the only one I don't have yet to complete the series.",1243555200,19,2235,4.528822055137844
3853643,5,B0026IBMY2,"never watching this last season of x-men evolution cause it was a very good series & to last 4 seasons it proves it!! it sounds as wishful thinking to see this last season released on dvd. I own all 3 seasons released on dvd & hope that this one will make it on dvd soon,though like I said, wishful thinking cause the plug's been pulled on releasing it long time ago.",1243555200,3,367,4.183098591549296
3853644,5,B0026IBMY2,"def did not want to spend any more money on any seasons, some people on amazon sell the seasons on dvd for half the price that amazon streaming asks, this season was cheap cause of not so many episodes I guess, the only one I was willing to really buy to watch because $25 a season is ridiculous I might as well just stick with Netflix and wait till they get all the seasons and watch for free, its just so weird how amazon has such OLD seasons of tv shows that people can buy really cheap now a days but on amazon its so expensive, movies to and everything like dam
was starting to like amazon till I saw how expensive all the streaming was",1393372800,2,641,4.095238095238095
3853645,3,B0026IBMY2,I watched this when I was a lot younger and wanted to see the end for once. It was okay.,1374537600,,88,3.45
3853646,5,B0026IBMY2,"The 5 stars I give it may seem generous, but even after a ten year cancellation, myself and many, many others are still deeply, madly in love with this show! The final season-especially the last two episodes-are all great each in their own way.

If we ever get the dvd, I'd recommended it to people who are already fans. If you're not, but you like all these superhero movies that come out every summer, then I suggest you hop on board the Evo train! X-Men:Evolution was
one of the greatest shows Marvel came out with. I feel very sad to see it get flack sometimes just because it isn't like X-Men:The Animated Series, or people dare say that Wolverine and The X-Men is better. (I like them all!)

As for this particular season, it had it's good and bad episodes like any other. It may have even seemed rushed at times, or thrown together, but what do you want? The crew could not have been that optimistic for the chances of a fifth season after getting the season green light for only nine episodes. I thought they did great with so few episodes. They may have even had a tighter budget, but I don't know that for sure.
I enjoyed Evo for the stories it told and it's characters, not so much for how
the episodes connected or whatever. Yes, it was disappointing that some plot lines and characters weren't followed up, but I thought some of them we're just awesome for what seems like just a kid's show. (One particular episode with a character I found just riveting. It had some heavy stuff you don't really find on most shows.
The episode was Sins of The Son. Amazing piece of craftsmanship right there, in my humble opinion.)

So, if you're already a fan, you'll like it if not love it. If you're not a fan, but you're into sci-fi, this may
be right up your alley-just be sure to watch the other seasons before this one so you know what's going on.",1308096000,2,1852,4.393586005830904
3853647,1,B0026IBMY2,"We X-Men Evolution fans have been waiting years since the Season #3 release for any sort of news or release of Season #4, but alas... nothing. Word I heard was that there were some copyright disputes over Season 4 among several involved parties and it may be years before this DVD is released.",1292630400,2,293,4.547169811320755
3853648,5,B0026IBMY2,"I've downloaded a couple of the episodes and watched them on my PC, but I'd much rather have them on DVD so I can watch them on the big screen with surround sound, I would buy it in a second.  My kids like it also, recently when they were sick, we spent the whole weekend watching Season 1 through 3 while it snowed outside.

Perfect weekend for bored kids !!!

Please God of all mutants and DVD production people, give us X-Men Evolution Season 4 DVD.  I promise to be good...",1274313600,2,477,4.208791208791209
3853649,5,B0026IBMY2,"Love, love, love this show.  I like all the X-Men animated series, and really love the current 'Wolverine and the X-Men' series.  But, X-Men: Evolution is a great show as well.

With the long awaited release of the mid-90's animated cartoon of the X-Men, we can only hope that this season will get taken a look at again.  Its a real shame that they only realeased 3 of the 4 seasons.  Also, the handling of the first 2 seasons wasn't too great either, with only season 3 seeing a proper complete full season release.  Now that Disney holds the rights to Marvel, maybe they will release season 4, and possibly season 1 and 2 as well.  However, Disney isn't known for giving what the fans truly want...

Studios, please, please, please relase season 4 of X-Men: Evolution, and while you are at it, please re-release seasons 1 and 2 as full complete season's as well.  Thanks in advance!!!!",1265846400,2,887,4.563291139240507
3853650,5,B0026IBMY2,The last season with a finale that would leave you wanting more. I watched this show on tv every chance i got and i own all the dvd volumes up to date. Im hoping they release the last 9 episodes so i don't have to rely on bootleg copies. Whats the point of owning a whole television animated series on dvd if you don't have every episode right? So hopfully WB releases the last episodes so i can enjoy the whole series aswell as the 90's series which has one more volume to come out. If you're a X-fan then this is a must have for any collector.,1254441600,2,545,4.055555555555555
3853651,5,B0026IBMY2,"I just bought season 3  and it dosent evan have the last episodes, the last episodes are on season 4 I really hope they put season 4 on dvd because they have all the other episodes on dvd might as well put season 4 on dvd or season 3 is going to look bad",1250467200,2,254,3.7037037037037037
3853652,5,B0026IBMY2,"The fourth and final season of X-Men: Evolution picks up relative to where Season 3's epic season finale left off.  Rogue under the sway of Mesmero copied everyone's powers again.  The X-Men, the Brotherhood, and the Acolytes attempt and fail to prevent Apocalypse's return.  He is back and his plan is in motion. Magneto tries to stop him alone in Impact but appears to perish in the battle.  Likewise Mystique appears to have died as well.  There seems to be no stopping him yet likewise there are problems in other corners like the growing anti-mutant sentiment from individuals like Robert Kelly as well as the Morlocks.

The Brotherhood gets a taste of false heroic fame until the truth comes out and they go back to what they usually do at least until things heat up with the Apocalypse situation.  X-23 is back for another round too with SHIELD and HYDRA on her trail.

Gambit takes Rogue to New Orleans to free his father from the Rippers. The Gambit-Rogue pairing flourishes to the extent that he gives her the Queen of Hearts card.

Leech also appears and with him there's the opening to beat Apocalypse.  The amalgam team up of X-Men, Brotherhood, Acolytes, and a returned Spyke divide up to face the Horsemen.  The only catch is the Horsemen are their former leaders/mentors under the sway of Apocalypse.  In the end, it is Leech's power acting through Rogue that enables them to divert him from the present, but he'll back though the mutants will be waiting for him.

We are show glimpses of XME's spin on future X-Men universe events and of course it is something to be proud in Professor Xavier's case as his purpose was to create a world where humans and mutants could one day exist together.",1248220800,7,1708,4.672240802675585

I want to download it & watch it on what device I please SINCE I PURCHASED THE SEASON. What A waste of data usage and for a crappy looking stream to boot. This is why I will always prefer physical media, sadly this season will never be getting a release. I will never waste my money on Amazon video ever again, that's for sure.
