1362073,5,B00004W5P2,"This is a great film. It recreates a cloistered world of academia where women were struggling to be heard. Two academics visit Paris and find themselves transported back to the French Revolution for a short time. They then must struggle to have their voice heard among those who doubt them.
The film contains some strong performance and wonderful scenes. The writing is a joy and the performances reinforce each other. I particularly liked the growing strength and confidence of the women as their careers slide and they refuse to forget what they have seen or heard.",1018396800,18,567,4.916666666666667
1362074,4,B00004W5P2,"I enjoyed this ghost drama on DVD.  I was not absolutely enthralled by it though.  I think the reason it didn't take me the whole way to 5 stars is that it is too much an intellectual approach to a paranormal experience. Two Victorian women in English education travel to France where they appear to be able to see through time as they visit the tourist sites.  They see scenes and people from centuries earlier. They decide to tell of their experience when they return to England.  All sorts of unpleasant events flow from this telling, including putting their futures in education on the line.  It was a well done tale but I simply felt too distanced from what was going on to really be enthralled by it.

1362075,5,B00004W5P2,"For anyone seriously interested in the paranormal, this movie is a must.  For anyone who's had an experience and endured humiliation and ridicule, this movie is even more important.  The story, based on an actual incident beginning in 1901, is well written and masterfully performed.  I've wanted to see a movie of this caliber, regarding the paranormal, my entire adult life.  Finding it has been akin to discovering hidden treasure.",976838400,19,434,5.1571428571428575
1362076,5,B00004W5P2,"This is an excellent ""camp"" drama. Great acting, well scripted makes one feel they are actually with these two ladies in Versailles. As a viewer I was drawn by the ""normal"" lives of these women who suffered an extraordinary experience. Well worth watching for lovers of English and French history.",973728000,6,297,4.96
1362077,5,B00004W5P2,"Miss Morison's Ghosts is an adaptation of the story of Charlotte Moberly and Eleanor Jourdain, two English academics from Oxford who, in the summer of 1901, visited Versailles Palace.  There they had a strange experience which seemed to involve ghosts.  Unlike many people involved with ghostly visitations, these ladies had a great deal to lose and nothing to gain from publicizing their experiences.  They did publish their story, however, in the interests of scientific research.  As a result their academic reputations suffered.
Miss Morison's Ghosts was shown on ""Mystery"" in the mid 1980s.  Since seeing it then I have anxiously awaited a chance to buy it on video.  Now the DVD version is well worth the wait.  The picture is as sharp as if it had been filmed yesterday, and the scenes in Oxford and Versailles are wonderfully atmospheric.
Dame Wendy Hiller and Hannah Gordon are excellent as Misses Morison and Lamont.  There are also many supporting actors who were probably not well known in the mid 1980s, but who are quite famous today.  And  the ghosts at Versailles?  A true paranormal adventure, or just a summer's daydream?  You'll have to watch and make up your own minds on that!",971136000,32,1197,4.93
7924774,3,B00004W5P2,"This film was, I think I am correct in saying, first shown on UK television some decades ago. The two main characters in it go by the names of Miss Elizabeth Morison and Miss Frances Lamont, which were the pseudonyms used by the authors of An Adventure, Charlotte Anne Elizabeth Moberly and Eleanor Frances Jourdain, in the first edition of their book in 1911 and in the two following editions of 1913 and 1924. When the book was first published, they were respectively Principal and Vice-Principal of St Hughs College, Oxford. (The authors real names were not made public until the fourth edition in 1931, by which time Miss Moberly was long retired and Miss Jourdain, who had succeeded Miss Moberly as Principal at St Hughs, had been already dead for some years.)

The film purports to be a dramatization, firstly of their visit to the Petit Trianon, Versailles, on 10th August 1901, which led them to believe that they had experienced a retrocognitive vision of the gardens of the Trianon as they had been just before the French Revolution and of some of the people who would have been found in the gardens back in 1789, and secondly of developments consequent on their adventure (e.g. its effect on their professional and personal lives at Oxford, and their somewhat acrimonious dealings with the research officers of the Society for Psychical Research). Significant artistic licence comes into the films depiction of the former, and its account of the latter comprises considerably more imagination than fact.

One normal explanation that has been suggested for the ladies ostensibly paranormal visions is that the supposedly ghostly personages whom they encountered were in fact Count Robert de Montesquiou and his friends, who were perhaps holding a fancy-dress party or rehearsing a tableau-vivant in the gardens on that afternoon. In the 1890s Montesquiou lived in Versailles with his Argentinian secretary/boyfriend, Gabriel Yturri. Montesquious house had a gate to the park of the Petit Trianon, and the Conservateur, Pierre de Nolhac, let him have a private key. They and their intellectual, aristocratic friends spent whole days in the gardens of the Trianon, holding poetry readings, ftes, tableaux-vivants etc., often in 18th century costume. The film suggests that the two ladies eventually found out about Montesquiou and his activities and realised that they provided a normal explanation for their adventure, but deliberately kept it dark because, having gone public with their ghost story, they could not face the humiliation of retracting. There is not a grain of evidence for this. The Montesquiou explanation was not mooted until more than half a century later, when the French author Philippe Jullian proposed it in his 1965 biography Robert de Montesquiou  un prince 1900. The explanation is unsatisfactory for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that Montesquiou and Yturri had ceased to live at Versailles several years prior to 1901. Jean Senelier, in his book  Le mystre du Petit Trianon  (1997), notes that by that time Montesquious days of hanging around the Petit Trianon were long over, and that the social world frequented by Robert de Montesquiou would have been nowhere near Paris or Versailles in August (pp. 24-26). It also fails to account for the ladies visions of scenery in the Trianon gardens which had ceased to exist over a century before.

This film is certainly entertaining to watch, and much of the acting, especially that of Hannah Gordon and Wendy Hiller in the two leading characters, is superb. The use of the beautiful air de ballet from Grtrys Zmire et Azore as part of the background music is not only a nice touch but also an appropriate one, since Grtry was later identified by Miss Jourdain, on the grounds of style, as one of the possible composers of the apparently ghostly music which she had heard on her second tour of the Trianon gardens on 2nd January 1902. But anyone who, having watched this film, fancies that they have seen the story of An Adventure will be sadly mistaken.",1441238400,6,4054,5.007418397626113
7924775,5,B00004W5P2,A lot of fun to watch with a fine cast. The story is a slow cooked supense thriller in a demure sort of way. Lovely British actors to watch and to listen to. I love the fact that there is not overly loud music and the dialogue and story are what is important to the makers of this film. Enjoy!,1415750400,,293,3.9

The acting and locations are outstanding.  I just wish the price of the DVD wasn't so steep.",1384646400,2,323,4.245901639344262

7924779,5,B00004W5P2,"I confess I have never heard of the story ""Miss Morrison's Ghosts"" until I stumbled onto the television drama on Youtube recently. My interest was piqued by the title so I decided to go ahead and watch it. After watching it, I decided to find out what had inspired this dramatization, and it turns out that the story is based on the real-life experiences of two Oxford academics,  Charlotte Anne Moberly and Eleanor Jourdain. These two respected academics had a strange experience while on a day trip to Versailles back in 1901. Somehow, as weird and incredible as it sounds, these two ladies found themselves being transported back in time to the court of Louis XVI in the 18th century. They recorded their experiences and made their experiences public, which in turn cost them their academic standing and also their reputations.

This 1981 ITV production stars Hannah Gordon (who was also featured in the popular period drama,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Upstairs-Downstairs-The-Complete-Series-40th-Anniversary-Collection/dp/B004H0ZHD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Upstairs, Downstairs: The Complete Series - 40th Anniversary Collection</a>&nbsp;and Dame Wendy Hiller. Both actresses play their roles convincingly and the entire dramatization is highly atmospheric. It does get a little slow moving at times, but the credible acting and the 'slip in time' storyline makes this a compelling watch.",1351036800,2,1444,5.9375
7924780,2,B00004W5P2,"The story is fascinating, I bought (at amazon, of course) and read the book with GREAT interest! The film is rather disappointing, a bit boring!",1349827200,,144,4.8
7924781,5,B00004W5P2,"Reading about academics is dry stuff, appreciated only by other academics; however, on a summer's afternoon in August of 1901, Moberly and Jourdain share a somewhat unique and other worldly experience. Their book, AN ADVENTURE, was published in 1911 and relates the incident, as well as the research and fact-checking the two ladies engaged in during the years after their initial encounter with long dead historical figures at the small, private chateau of Queen Marie Antoinette, known as the Petit Trianon.

Today, time slips are known by all, and more people seem to be experiencing them. This DVD brings the book on which the DVD is based, THE GHOSTS OF TRIANON, to life.  The DVD is an obvious advantage for the reader because it's difficult to picture this incident in the mind's eye.

I recently suggested this DVD and book to a colleague of mine who teaches French, hoping that she might entice her students to read the book, view the DVD, and plan their yearly trip to France around it. I understand that many students do this very thing. What an excursion that must be!",1322265600,,1080,4.795698924731183
7924782,4,B00004W5P2,"This is a great re-inactment of a true incident, in which two lady educators in 1901, visited Versailles, and saw people there who had lived 112 years before!

Ghost stories of any kind are thrilling -- but to me, the BEST ghost stories are the true ones!  It is true that the ghosts of the people purportedly so clearly seen by the two 20th century ladies, (including, in all likelihood, that of Marie Antoinette), did meet with cruel and savage deaths.  However, these deaths were NOT seen by ""modern"" lady educators, and so THIS true story, (and I, for one definitely DO believe it actually did happen), is far less violent on the screen than many recountings of modern hauntings, (as in several current TV Ghost-Hunting programs) -- and definitely less violent than many (fictional) horror movies today.  Because of this, the viewer is allowed to concentrate, not on violence -- but on science!  DID the ladies REALLY see these ghosts?  And if so, 1) Why did one sometimes see ghosts that the other did not, and 2) HOW did this justaposition in time take place?

WENDY HILLER -- a superb actress in all of her films, (and probably plays too, though I never had the pleasure of seeing any) 00 including that of the original ""Eliza"" in the non-musical ""Pygmalian"", (later redone, musically, as ""My Fair Lady""), is superb as always as Miss Morrison, the principle of one of Oxford (England's), collges, and HANNAH GORDEN, (who performed so well in 'Upstairs Downstairs', and 'The Elephant Man', among other memorable performances), as her vice-principal, Miss Lamont, are totally and completely believable in their roles. As is the entire cast!  The music, direction, camera angles, and (beautiful!) costumes are also superb.  The script was written SO well you might think the actors were ad-libbing!
Kudos to all who worked on this memorable film.  All those...except for one category of artistic pros.  It's too bad these pros were only 85% ""up to snuff""....whilst the rest of the cast and crew was nearly at the 100% mark!

So -- who ruined this otherwise sterling video for me?  THE SOUND TECNICIANS! I suppose they had one unfortunate problem to begin with -- and that is the wonderful, (but sometimes incomprehensible), English accents of all the cast members.  However -- what I found most annoying was that these often-incomprehenisble accents were made all the more difficult to understand because THE AUDIO PORTION OF THE FILM DID NOT 'BALANCE OUT' THE SOUND TRACK.  Voices were heard loud and soft, as perhaps is in real life -- but here, it was a real annoyance to this viewer.  Either the voice-track was so low you couldn't hear exactly what was being said, or -- if one turns up the volume -- often SO loud you wonder if the audio tract might wake the dead....or at least bring complaints from your neighbours! Turn the volume down, and you often can't hear what is being said...turn it up, and you risk busted eardrums.  The sound techicians should have realized this, and put the sound-track on ""auto-level"", so one could hear everything without being accused of making a disturbance in one's neighbourhood.  To be fair, I suspect, perhaps, that putting the audio track on a ""real-to-life"", unaltered mode, was a try at making the film seem even more realistic. Good try, technicians -- but the ""too-loud or too-soft, unmodulated"" sound track ruined a great deal of this movie for me.

I see there that the manufacturers have discontinued making this video -- and that prices for it have skyrocked!  I ask the manufacturers, here, please to reconsider their decision, and continue making this great video.  Only this time with an ""auto-level"", modulated audio track!  With 2012 fast approaching, all things supernatural, ghostly, paranormal, (and dealing with time-travel!), will, I feel, find increasing interest for the general public.  This classic, (and true!) story, of two early 20th century lady educators, who encuntered the ghosts of Marie Antoinette and her court, is sure to best-seller, if publicised in the right way!  A remake might also be an idea -- but this video is SO perfect, it needs no remake.  Just tweak the sound-track so we can hear everything that is so realistically and fascinatingly said!",1255392000,5,4237,4.917134831460674
7924783,5,B00004W5P2,"Having just watched Miss Morison's Ghosts for the first time I feel I have to watch it again. Considering it was based on an actual happening, the events recorded were certainly weird. A time slip into the past at Versailles and the ensuing reporting of the happenings all lead to an enthralling film superbly acted by Wendy Hillier and Hannah Gordon. I was especially taken with Miss Gordon's performance especially her final sermon, but what a twist at the end!!! I would thoroughly recommend this film to any who have not yet bought it.",1095638400,9,539,4.74468085106383
