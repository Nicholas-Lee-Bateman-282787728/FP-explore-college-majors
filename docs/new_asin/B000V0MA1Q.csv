8368459,4,B000V0MA1Q,"I met Major Les Hiddins many years ago at a book launch; ""Explore Wild Australia"" (First Published 1999) I subsequently bought the book. He is an interesting and captivating factual story teller, with a huge amount of experience in, and knowledge of the Australian Bush. He has a wealth of understanding (far beyond most) of the Australian Outback and in particular its Tropical Regions. This stems from his many years of service (23years+) in the Australian Army as a researcher, this lead to becoming an Army tutor which then helped Les impart his passion and love of the Outback. He has a keen view of how things were, what actually went on and how things should have been! There is a great video bio at [...] well worth a look. Les has produced many doco's, books and DVD's, they are great! This guy is passionate about survival and exploration, a true Aussie icon and font of knowledge of the Bush. A thoroughly likeable character.

Enjoy it all !

Cheers
