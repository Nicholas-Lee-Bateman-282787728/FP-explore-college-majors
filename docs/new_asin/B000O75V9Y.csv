The host, Samantha Brown, spends most of the time playing the silly airhead let loose in the lap of luxury, rather than imparting useful information. You'll learn more by visiting the Four Seasons website, and clicking on the links for the two hotels (the hotels were Rock Resorts when this film was made, they are now managed by Four Seasons).

Which hotel is better? Families with children will prefer Manele Bay, while adults who appreciate peace and quiet will prefer the Lodge at Koele. As this video points out, the two hotels are 15 minutes apart and minibuses run between them every half hour.

We preferred the Lodge at Koele because it is quieter and significatly cooler than Manele Bay (about 8 degrees). The room rates at Koele are also less (as much as $100/night) than those at Manele Bay. Be sure to ask for specials (3 nights for the price of 2)

Another shortcoming in the video is that it doesn't show much of the island of Lanai, and nothing of Lanai City, a laid-back small town that is worth a visit. Hotel Lanai, the only other hotel on the island, offers basic lodging with surprisingly sophisticated food. Plan to have at least one dinner there.

One should note that the rooms have been extensively rennovated since this video was filmed, but it is a nice way to plan your vacation to Hawaii.",1248393600,,309,4.327586206896552
