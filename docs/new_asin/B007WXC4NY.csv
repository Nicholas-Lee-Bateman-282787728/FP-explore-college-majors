5113770,5,B007WXC4NY,"This movie was so well acted, written and so bittersweet.  I completely agree with Ramses review, Colin Morgan performance was a complete 180 from his character in Merlin, he truly had my boyfriend in tears with his performance in Parked.  And Colm Meaney is superb in everything he does, this movie just touched us deeply.",1340150400,6,323,4.8545454545454545
5113771,5,B007WXC4NY,"This film is not hilariously funny & I think it is a misnomer that the DVD cover describes like it. If you think homelessness & drug taking is funny then this is the film for you.

There are some funny scenes in the film don't get me wrong, but it should not be taken as a light-hearted comedy. The last half an hour or so is more hard hitting than the first hour & is very thought provoking, as Fred & Cathal's friendship starts to break down due to Cathal's drug taking. I agree that both Colm Meaney & Colin Morgan are both superbly cast, especially Colin Morgan as Cathal who is on a downward spiral to becoming a full blown junkie, which is obviously the total opposite to the loveable Merlin. This film shows that he is a very talented actor & can play various characters without being typecast.

To get the most enjoyment out of the film I suggest you put the subtitles on, because of the strong Irish accents.",1339804800,12,917,4.325581395348837

5113776,5,B007WXC4NY,"Adored this film!  It tackles some hard subject matter and makes you laugh as well.  Colin Morgan does a masterful job with a tough role - an IV narcotic junkie who's upbeat and life-positive, something of an oxymoron...but he's fantastic, as he always is in everything he plays.  Colm Meany WAS Fred, and he made it look easy.  Great film, looking forward to more Northern Irish productions.",1413763200,,392,4.8059701492537314

5113778,5,B007WXC4NY,"Colin Morgan's performance is so real and so touching I was in tears.  I watched it twice and was again in tears.  Colin Morgan is one of the best actor's I have ever seen.  Colin Meaney was also wonderful.  This movie is so touching and gentle in it's portrayal of lives that are lost. Colin Meaney's portrayal of a man who has become homeless in his later years and yet is trying to hold onto his dignity is wonderful.  Colin Morgan as the lost and vulnerable young drug addict is heartbreakingly brilliant.  His sweet and gentle portrayal is haunting.  I ordered this movie not expecting to like it, but just because I wanted to see Colin Morgan in a movie.  It is now in my top five best movies I have watched.  I hope this amazing young actor does not disappear to only the stage. I would watch a movie just because he is in it.",1409011200,,833,4.288461538461538

I found that the combination of Morgan's last few scenes, one being particularly realistic, were so emotionally overwhelming that I had to wait a few days to watch it a second time.  Working with this population on a daily basis, it hit home a little harder for me than perhaps for most.  Be prepared; for some, it may start out a little slow and you have to be keen in hearing to understand some of what they say.

5113785,4,B007WXC4NY,"I'll be honest. I purchased this strictly because Colin Morgan is in it. I loved him in Merlin and wanted to see something else he'd done. I think he's a stupendous actor with such a wide range of emotion. His eyes and face! Man sometimes he doesn't even need words for the viewer to clearly know what he's thinking. Anyway, look forward to much more from this young man.

If they included this movie as Oscar worthy I'd definitely put both up for best actor and supporting actor, as well as best movie.  Truly loved this movie.  Colin Morgan is without a doubt one of my favorite British Actors.  Well Done!",1390003200,,459,4.364705882352941
5113787,5,B007WXC4NY,"I was blown away by this film.  Not a romantic comedy at all, but a serious and touching look at homelessness, addiction, friendship and love.  Colm Meany and Colin Morgan hit the mark head on as Fred and Cathal.  Two men drawn together by their circumstances in life become friends and ultimately very dear to each other. Milka Ahlroth is wonderful as Jules, the music teacher who wins Fred's heart.  Colin Morgan has definitely become one of my favorite actors and I hope he goes far with his career.  I hope one day there will be an edition of this move with special features.  It would be great to hear the actors provide commentary and see a ""making of"" segment.  Well done and I highly recommend.",1389225600,,702,4.523809523809524
5113788,5,B007WXC4NY,"One of the best young actors I have seen in a very long time!  Colm Meaney did a great job as Fred also.  I loved this movie.  It does move more as a documentary than as a film for entertainment and that has a lot to do with where the director is coming from but it in no way detracts from the quality of the film.  On the contrary, I think it helped.  I first rented the region 1 version of this film which was horribly produced.  You can't hear the dialogue as the background track is in the foreground.  Seems someone mixed those up.  However, because it was filmed with the feel of a documentary, I was still able to enjoy and appreciate the story in this film.  After purchasing the region 2 DVD, I was able to fully enjoy the movie.  Well done.",1377043200,,750,4.110344827586207

Then one day a punk kid tries to rob him of anything in his car and was going to kill him, That is when he meets a very Special friend very different from him, and they help each other together.",1373155200,,528,3.990566037735849
5113791,5,B007WXC4NY,"Parked is about Fred Daly (Colm Meaney) a recently unemployed, homeless man who lives in his car parked in a parking lot by the ocean. His neighbor? A young drug addict named Cathal (played by Colin Morgan) who lives in the car a few spaces over. Fred is a quiet, very reserved man while Cathal is a bright, outgoing, sweet and funny man, when he's not pulled into serious moods fueled by his drug addiction or his painful past. They become fast friends and slowly Cathal brings Fred out of his shell. The movie follows Fred from the beginning, along his friendship with Cathal, his budding relationship with a woman and the pitfalls of his homeless predicament. The movie is slow at first, but then story and the superb acting by Colm Meaney and Colin Morgan has you swept up into their lives! I won't ruin it for you, but there is a bit of a downfall involving the repercussions of living on the streets and being near the drug community. It's heart-breaking to see because you come to care greatly about these characters. So grab a tissue or two friends. (Just FYI, I'm a big softie and can cry at the drop of a hat. So downfall, while sad, may resonate differently with you.)

So I bought this movie because I'm a fan of Colin Morgan and wanted to see him outside of Merlin. You thought he was a good actor before Merlin? There is no question, after watching this movie you will completely agree that he has got it. Guy's got range, talent, humor, etc....He knows what he's doing! Also, loved Colm Meaney's smart quiet approach to Fred. Can't help but fall in love with his character and WANT to follow him around during the movie.

Check this out. With the exception of the end, I ADORE this movie. Personally, I think worth the buy.",1372896000,,1738,4.479495268138801
5113792,5,B007WXC4NY,"I have become a fan of Colin Morgan, and his performance in this movie as opposed to his other projects he has undertaken was a vast difference. I really enjoyed the interaction between him (Cathal) and Colm Meany (Fred). It is one I will play over and over. Well worth it.",1372809600,,273,4.372549019607843
5113793,5,B007WXC4NY,"I fell in love with the movie Parked.  Parked is such a heart wrenching and emotionally raw film and Colin Morgan and Colm Meaney are brilliant playing the characters Cathal and Fred.  Colin portrays Cathal's struggle with himself and the despair in his soul so superbly.  The scene Have you seen the actual moment when that leaf breaks from its branch?  Its a Its a beautiful thing. is so reflective.  The allegory is simple and so breathtaking. And so incredibly sad. What kills me the most is the beauty lost in this boy. This is him, not only acknowledging that nothing lasts, but also him capable of recognizing and bringing out the most precious moments, seeing beauty and fragility in life. As fleeting as his own.  I could feel Cathal's pain, could feel him becoming lost with the feeling that no one cared whether he lived or died. The true tragedy is that this kind of thing happens everyday to those around us. Cathal is just one soul of many...

The first time I watched Parked, it left me completely emotionally drained.  So much of this movie reflected parts of my own life, so it hit me close to home.  It reminds us, 'Just because someone blames you, or pushes you away; doesn't mean you should give up.'  I have watched it many times ~~ and the knife that cuts into my heart does not dull...  This film has literally changed my life.
~~ Cathal Forever ~~",1371859200,3,1371,4.510121457489879
5113794,4,B007WXC4NY,"I had waited for a long time to see this movie.  Being in America I could not purchase it until last month.  But I am so glad that I did.  I am a huge fan of Colin Morgan and Colm Meaney.

Colin Morgan is such a talented young actor if you have not seen him act then you need to see him today.  He will put just about all of Hollywood's actors to shame.  (I also had the pleasure of seeing him in his theater play in London, during my vacation, Temptest.)  I stayed behind to meet him afterwards and he is not only very kind to his fans, he is down to earth and just wonderfully pleasant.

That being said...
This movie is about a man down on his luck.  Colm Meaney just moved back to Ireland and has no money, no home.  He has to live in his car.  He cannot get any sort of aid because he has no address.  Its an awful cycle that shows that being homeless and getting out of that situation is not that easy.
He is depressed and just lost.  Until he meets Cathal.
Cathal parks his car next to his one day and become ""neighbors"".  Cathal shows Fred that there is more to life, that he is not to old to just give up yet.  That he can fight and get his life back.
Unfortunately Cathal has a dark secret he is keeping.  His life is spiraling downhill because of drugs.  Cathal had a hard life, and after his mum died ... he had little hope left.

Its such a wonderful story about friendship but also very emotional.  (Get the tissues ready!  I needed them)

I gave this story 4 stars for one reason.  Some of the story was hard to follow and a lot of it I had to guess.  It doesnt go into detail why Fred is homeless, and his relationship with Jules is just so up in the air, especially at the end.  I think a bit more could have gone in the story details and backstory to each character.
But it doesnt take away from how amazing this story is and is A MUST SEE!",1371772800,,1858,3.9864130434782608
5113795,5,B007WXC4NY,I enjoyed this movie more than I expected to.  I bought it for Colin Morgan's being in it but was really engaged by the movie.  It's sad but so good I'll watch it again.,1370390400,,169,3.9411764705882355
5113796,5,B007WXC4NY,"This is not a movie that will make you feel warm and fuzzy. Even better, it pulls at your heart and causes you to fall in love with the characters and story, empathizing with them throughout their journey. It's a film that has the rare quality of lasting past the screen. Even after watching it, I feel like the story is part of my memory now. I go back and watch scenes and remember the journey the two characters take together. There is one scene towards the end that brings me to tears every time, and I love it. It makes me feel, which I can't say for a lot of the movies that have been coming out. I think one of its strongest points is that it hits the heart of drug addition and portrays reality in a raw and brutal way. The film brings to light the unfortunate, living on the line in the midst of normal society. The metaphors and deeper meanings in the movie are brilliant as well.
Given that it's a more serious movie, it still had me smiling and chuckling multiple times througout the show. The character development was well acted and had many endearing moments.

And the soundtrack is just amazing. So if you do buy the dvd, it will double both as a movie AND relaxing background music.",1367539200,3,1199,4.3053097345132745
5113797,5,B007WXC4NY,"I rented this movie because of Colin Morgan-a fantastic up and coming actor of BBC's Merlin who has captured my attention because of his excellent acting skills.  I went into this movie not expecting much, but got a performance that-after watching it 6 weeks ago-has stuck with me.  This movie is powerful in the emotions it evokes.  About two homeless men, each living in their cars in a parking lot, this movie takes you on a journey of both success and failure.  The movie is so well written and the actors are all so good in their roles that I found myself immediately engrossed.  I felt their emotions-I wanted them to turn their lives around.

I don't want to give away too many spoilers, so I'll end my review with this:  I don't buy DVDs-I rent them from Netflix, watch them once, and go on.  This movie, however, is one for the DVD collection.  I've watched it twice now and I plan to watch it many more times.  It is simply THAT good.",1365724800,10,944,4.404624277456647
5113798,5,B007WXC4NY,"First, a warning.  The region 1 dvd apparently does not have subtitles.  The region 2 dvd has subtitles in English, French, and German, but to play the region 2 dvd's you will need a region 2 or all region dvd player.  Some of the dialogue is heavily accented and may be difficult to understand.  The dialogue is, of course, important to the story.

That said, this is an unforgettable film.  I watched it on a Saturday morning two weeks ago and merely thinking about it, certain images return.  They are difficult and haunting and have to do with Cathal's deterioration.  Having followed Colin Morgan I know that he puts a lot of study into his portrayals because he says it is important to him to be genuine and authentic.  And that is what you will see.  Keep that in mind.  I would not suggest a family viewing where younger children are involved.

For the adults, this is a film well worth watching.  It is uplifting and sad, and beautiful in a poignant way.  The entire film is excellent, but most especially the performances.  They will stay with you.",1365206400,3,1058,4.553191489361702
5113799,5,B007WXC4NY,Possible Spoiler Alert - I can't deny that you might end up frustated by this movie but you will love it anyway because the story is woven together so beautifully. I especially liked the use of the diving board as a representation of Fred's metamorphosis througout the movie. When he finally takes the dive into the water you can almost feel Cathal's spirit cheering him on. I really hope this movie makes it into more that a few theaters in the US. I would love to be able to go see it in my city.,1361923200,2,498,4.252631578947368
5113800,4,B007WXC4NY,"I watched this film because of Colin Morgan.

Parked is difficult to sum up in a sentence or a paragraph, because like every good film, it isn't about one thing or a few things. Threads run over and under each other, themes weave in and out. At the end, I find myself wondering what, really, it *was* about.

Fred Daly has recently returned to Ireland, having spent some years in England. Without a job, without a fixed address, his life is in his car. The day Cathal pulls into the same carpark, things in Fred's life begin to roll and shift. Cathal has a good heart, and the young man and the older man form an unlikely friendship that will change them both. And yet - it isn't unlikely at all. Both Cathal and Fred are at a point in their lives where they are lost and drifting; part of their effect on each other is that they give each other direction, a sense of anchorage and a place to moor at the end of the day. 'Parked' turns out to be a metaphor for both Fred and Cathal's life, and the film is the story of changing, finding direction and the momentum to keep moving. The scene at the very close is a beautiful example of that circularity and momentum.

Despite the wonderful performances of the cast, especially the fantastic Colm Meaney, there was a key part towards the end where the storytelling fell down a bit. I don't want to add more for fear of spoiling it, but I felt there wasn't a proper transition from one scene to the other, explaining how we got there. It was just, 'bang, let's move onto what happened next'.

I recommend anyone watching or thinking of watching Parked to go on over to YouTube and watch some interviews with Colin Morgan (i.e. at the Mannheim Film Festival) talking about how he prepared for the role of Cathal - how in portraying him, ""that drugs isn't the main thing - it's the person. I don't say 'I'm playing a drug addict', because that's not how anyone would describe themselves. When I went in and met those people, I did say, 'hello my name's Colin', and they didn't go, 'hello, I'm a drug addict'.""

There's something about Colin Morgan - he looks into the soul of his character, the story he is a part of, and gives you a piece of artistry that makes you think THIS. THIS is what acting is all about. He has an instinct for seeing what a person is made of, and the curiosity and knack for asking the right questions - and in addition to all that, the wisdom to know not every question has an easily-told answer. These are some of the things that make him different - I'd say that those qualities are what make him the actor that he is, rather than the reverse.

A lot of people, I'm sure, will watch or hear about this film because of Colin Morgan (best known for his role in the BBC's Merlin); he is that rare person who can sell the idea that acting is art. He's not a performer - he is an *artist*, and that is a very different thing. He brings a depth and nuance to his work that few young actors do, because he is looking inward, revealing and discovering layers within layers, wheels inside wheels. It's not something done for people, for an audience - we just get to witness this extraordinary interaction between person and idea that creates a kind of third space, the acting that is really being. And that is our privilege.

As a final note, I don't mean to dismiss the other actors in this film, by talking so much about Colin Morgan. Honestly speaking, I don't know too much about them, while I have been following Morgan's work. I keep saying it, but I think Colin Morgan is special even among his own kind. Watch him.",1348444800,28,3586,4.343283582089552
5113801,5,B007WXC4NY,"Parked took me totally by surprise.  I watched it for Colm Meaney but came away a new fan of Colin Morgan.  The movie itself is elegant, simple and heartbreaking with an ending filled with hope and love.  The cinematography was breathtaking, the music score haunting, the dialogue real and the story couldn't be more topical.  But it was the acting by the two leads that set this movie head and shoulders above anything I've seen, literally, in years.  I've never seen Colm Meaney give a better performance.  As Fred Daley, homeless and parked in his car with nowhere else to live, he survives in a life of quiet desperation.  He finds comfort in routine, but no real joy.  Colm's craggy visage gives a stolid look to our hero and his face shows all his woes.  It's not until Colin Morgan's Cathal parks his own car nearby and the two become neighbors that Fred's life takes a turn for the better.  Cathal is a druggie with a heart of gold, able to help others but not himself.  Cathal brings the missing joy and verve back into Fred's life, and even steers him into a little romance.  Colin Morgan plays Cathal in turns as jittery, intense, young, old, wise and, ultimately, heartbreaking. As Colm Meaney himself said about Colin's performance, it was simply brilliant. This movie is worth watching, more than once.  And the performances are truly award worthy.  Well worth seeking out.",1342742400,11,1387,4.7012448132780085

With lots of atmospheric shots that made me miss the UK even more. There are a lot of messages you can take from the movie, but I saw it as an up-close picture of how we're expected to be 100% independent, when in reality there are a lot of situations where people (realistically) need someone else's help to get through.
