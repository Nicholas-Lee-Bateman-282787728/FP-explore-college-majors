6133802,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"I can NOT wait to watch this with my daughter, we absolutely LOVE the Tinkerbell movies and were thrilled when we saw that a new one was coming out!!!! AND THIS ONE HAS A FAERIE PIRATE! How cool is that?!?!?!?!?! I'm sure this is going to be amazing, and will have my daughter laughing and loving every moment of it!",1391126400,9,316,4.283333333333333
6133803,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"I too, am trying to balance the reviews because of Chris below.  Why he feels the need to one star a movie he admits to not seeing while stepping on his soap-box in a crazy way is beyond me.

The Tinkerbell movies are always fun, and appropriate for young children.  I'm excited that this one has a character voiced by Tom Hiddleston.  Once it comes out - I'll edit my review if necessary, but I'm sure it will be wonderful as all the others were.",1390780800,6,447,4.223529411764706
6133804,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"This will obviously be changed once it's ordered. I'm a 32 year old mother of 2 little girls and grew up loving Disneyland and Disney movies. Unfortunately I moved to Texas so my little girls can't live the childhood I had. Apparently I had a much better childhood over the 1 star rating guy, which is why I'm blabbing on and on ... oh wait no I'm not. I'm just wanting to say that I can't wait to see this movie! I have all the other Fairy movies and all the Peter Pans too! I was shocked when I saw this pop up as a recommended movie for us!",1390089600,7,543,3.9908256880733943
6133805,5,B00H5RYN5Y,I don't even have to see this movie to know its going to be amazing. Why? Because tinkerbell is amazing. peter pan is amazing. captain hook is amazing. therefor this movie will be amazing. enough said.,1389830400,11,201,4.611111111111111
6133806,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"This movie will likely be just as wonderful as its predecessors. The guy that gave it a single star rating is a quack.

Update: My daughters and I love this movie as much as the previous 5! It really holds up, in fact, the animation on this one is the best yet. keep them coming!",1389657600,40,279,4.072727272727272
6133807,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"We have all four of the previous films and this one like the others has been given 1st class treatment.  The characters are all so adorable, the story was good, brilliant and the movie lives up to it's predecessors in every way.  The crocodile, the old pirate and the fairy's are very comical. In one seen, prior to stealing the full batch of blue pixie dust, Zarina,  the pirate fairy is showing Tinker bell how she can mix it with different things to make things such as garden fairy talent, wind and the wind talent, and the scene was funny as the series is.  Zarina steals the blue pixie dust, Tinker Bell and her friends get it back and Zarina then throws her potionlike dust she made at them and switches their talents which adds comedy to the whole thing.  They then go back to get the dust and fight against the pirate, one of whom is the young captain hook. I purchased this movie without any hesitation because the four preceding it have been given 5 Star treatment and it was just as good as we thought it would be.  I think that they should release these in theatres they are that good.  Truly I like these movies more than Peter Pan itself and many other high quality promoted well known movies. None of the movies have disappointed.",1389312000,68,1246,4.414847161572053
6133808,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"In response to Chris Matthews review:
nice story - dry sense of humor?
This movie is probably good, the other ones sure are (at least TB & the Lost Treasure and TB & the Great Fairy Rescue). Positive roles for girls, fun to watch. Not too scary. Sweet but not saccharine.
Maybe get mom a new razor next year?",1388707200,25,308,4.237288135593221
6133809,1,B00H5RYN5Y,"Often times, I look back and wonder where I failed to realize the abnormal childhood I had. To be honest, I doubt that I would have actually perceived the way I conducted my childhood for so many years. Sure, there were signs here and there leading up to the undeniable realization of things being different, but only in hindsight was I able to see those. Life was pretty ""normal"" prior to that.
After all, living within such a conservative all-American (predominately) small town Southern Baptist close nit community here Georgia, I never had reason to question the ""charmed"" life I was able to live. In fact, mother, was the ideal mom like those from the old black and white sitcoms of the perfect American life. A beautiful homemaker, PTA member, church choir, soccer coach, minivan, cook, you name it. . .she it excelled in all of it. Dad a Naval Vet, proud NRA member, patriotic tattoos, ran an all-terrain vehicle shop for the sportsman, hunters, and assorted recreationists. ""A man's man"" was he.
Only later did I find out how literal that was.
I had two dads.
It wasn't until the impressionable age of sixteen that I made the harsh discovery while walking in on my 'mom' in the bathroom as she stood in front of the toilet wher dress hiked up. In what seemed like time stopped with the only sound heard was that of running faucet water as we blankly stared into one another's eyes. What could I say when 'mom' was not really 'mom' but a 'dad.'
From there, I was left with few options, fight, flight or fold. I decided to fold. We never talked about that morning. They were good to me and aside from a few details, functioned quite well as a husband, wife and parents.
Mine just so happened to be like a ""pirate"" and a ""fairy.""
I purchased this movie as a gift for them in hopes that they will enjoy it. Reviewing it like do many other people do on movies not actually released yet would be a disservice.
I'd rate this movie higher, but since I have to wait for it, at this point, the most I can give it is a one-star rating.",1388620800,21,2032,4.435828877005347

And although the pre-mom version of me would have disliked the Tinkerbell movies because of my self-perceived superb taste in films, the current me appreciates them. There is so much garbage in the children's tv world, that this movie actually manages to outshine much of it. The movie is colorful and pretty to look at, it genuinely makes me laugh at times, the music is cute, and it is fun to see some backstory to Captain Hook and the crocodile. Right now it is a favorite in our house and is preferred by my 4 year old daughter, and I don't mind that one bit. Yay!",1485216000,2,666,4.2936507936507935

We have watched all the movies together over and over again.
To my surprise at age 15 the little girl appeared again,  Watching it on 'her own secretly
on Netflix brought us back to years gone by.  I had to buy it to add to our library of movies.
On a rainy day this mom and her teenage daughter grab a blanket and some popcorn
and have a day at the movies.",1481932800,,420,3.988095238095238
6133841,1,B00H5RYN5Y,"I paid for this drivel. Can you believe it? It's a purchase and not free on Amazon Prime.

Outrageous!

The lack of creativity, the unoriginal ideas....no wonder our younger generations have short attention spans. Seriously, the cast must have mortgages to pay or something. I don't understand why trash like this gets made. There is PLENTY out there for children with far more intelligence, there's no disrespecting the young age of the audience, and far funnier than this ....

Thanksgiving-eve, the grandchildren and I were going through Prime to see what was available. The shiny colors and princess glow attracted their attention. I loathe stupid entertainment because its sole purpose is to babysit. But the Twins were clamoring to watch it, and I succumbed. Fifteen minutes in, this became background noise. What does it say when you've lost the audience you're trying to captivate?",1481241600,,889,5.159722222222222

6133847,4,B00H5RYN5Y,"Born to the rigid caste system of Fairy Land, Zarina is seemingly fated to live her days stuffing fairy dust into bags in a dehumanizing assembly line.  When she rebels and dares to question the system she is exiled.  One year later she returns launching a shocking bio-terror attack, she drugs the population and steals Fairy Land's vital supply of blue fairy dust.  Tinkerbell and her essentially interchangeable collection of fairy friends must battle both Zarina and her pirate horde led by a young Captain Hook (or as he was then known, Cabin Boy Hand).

OK, I'm being a bit snarky (though Tinkerbell's Pixie Hollow really seems like a terrible place to live) but that's essentially the plot.

This was a big hit with our 3 year olds.  They especially liked the pirates' song and dance number.  A lot of the plot is a bit too insular, based on the magical system of Pixie Hollow and it's intricate color-coded caste system for fairies.  But the girls don't seem to mind.

More music and more dance and fewer discussion of fairy dust colors would be welcome, but this is a cute story for kids.",1478131200,3,1097,4.642487046632124

This is also great and she learned there are mean people that can do bad things and one must be careful when dealing with people you don't know very well.

6133925,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"This is a hilarious animated film that was all too short. A new character, Zarina, has the scientist's fascination and intense curiosity to see how things work, especially fairy dust. She does experiments, alters the dust, gets fired as a dust fairy, leaves Pixie hollow and becomes a pirate. Has a great costume. A year later she comes back , puts everyone asleep, except the usual gang from all the Tinkerbell movies, and manages to switch around all their talents. Tinkerbell becomes a water fairy, and so forth. This switching of powers is very funny. But whole movie is very funny throughout. At first Zarina is thought to be the captain of the pirates, but this turns out not to be the case. How the fairies defeat these human pirates is very funny and clever. The film is funnier than previous Tinkerbell releases and is more of an ensemble piece where Tinkerbell does not in fact have the most lines or scenes. All a group effort this time. Included two very funny vignettes of the fairies on the beach as bonus features.",1446249600,2,1029,4.65934065934066

- you shouldn't try new things, or ever question the way things have been done for hundreds of years
- when a good friend leaves because their life has been destroyed, say goodbye and forget about them
- no matter what someone has done, even if they were trying to destroy your world, they are immediately good again as soon as their evil friends betray them

(you can argue with the third there's maybe a good lesson in forgiveness here, but that wasn't how it came across in the movie)

I'm sure some people with just say ""lighten up,"" but when I asked my 8yo what she learned from the movie, she said ""not to try new things.""  We had a long conversation about the movie after that.",1426550400,,780,4.315068493150685

6134081,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"I'm a 22-year-old college student but I am a huge fan of the Tinkerbell movie series and The Pirate Fairy might be my favorite one so far!

In addition to the regular cast of characters, this movie introduces us to Zarina, a fairy with big dreams for the potential of fairy dust, but whose ideas land her in a bit of trouble with the other fairies. Sound familiar? Zarina is, in her own way, quite similar to Tinkerbell, only when her plans go awry she turns to piracy.

Some of the best parts of this film include:
* Being introduced to Captain Hook and the pirates for the first time
* Seeing more of the island including Skull Rock
* Some amazing outfits! (Zarina's outfit was designed by Project Runway winner Christian Siriano)
* A great new song sung by the pirates (including a part featuring Tom Hiddleston who voices Captain Hook)

This is a visually stunning film in the tradition of the Tinkerbell films that have come before it, with plenty of fun moments and a great storyline. If you're a fan of the previous Tinkerbell films, you'll definitely like this one.

As for the physical dvd itself, this package comes with a regular dvd as well as a blu-ray dvd and an online, digital copy that can be accessed anytime you have internet through the Disney Movies Anywhere website or app. You can also download it on the app (as I occasionally do in my iPad so I can watch when I'm traveling). Plus, if you are a fan of the Disney Movie Rewards program, the blu-ray version will score you 150 points.",1419552000,,1507,4.469090909090909

6134083,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"While the film doesn't give you a date, it apparently takes when Captain Hook still had hands and Peter Pan was not a round. Zarina tinkers with pixie dust and becomes a master alchemist to the dismay of her boss. She runs off with a group of pirates (that explains the hair) and robs the community of all of their dust. Our brave group of fairies, lead by Ms. T. Bell  go after the dust...but wait! Zarina has swapped their powers which creates some fun confusion.

This was an enjoyable film, one you will have fun sitting through with the kids/grandkids. The fairies provide a positive role model for girls as they are assertive and perform typical male tasks, but do so in a fashion as to still be girls.",1419465600,,708,4.438461538461539

6134099,4,B00H5RYN5Y,"The Pirate Fairy is the 5th and (at the time of this reviews writing) most recent entry into Disneys CG animated Tinker Bell series.  The 6h film known as Legend of the NeverBeast has been announced and is already deep in production.

I have to say, as an individual who has followed the entire series thus far (with the only absence coming in the form of The Secret of the Wings for whatever reason), I have to say that Pirate Fairy is to date the strongest entry into the series by far and easily much more deserving than the apparent lack of hype associated with it.

Tinker Bell and the Pirate Fairy actually did receive a domestic theatrical release on February 13, 2014 and made it to the home market on DVD two months later on April 1st as just The Pirate Fairy.  Though budget information was never released publicly, estimates place production cost of the film somewhere around $55-million, having come from the DisneyToon division, the team who specializes in direct-to-dvd animated films (these are the same guys who ended up striking gold with the Planes franchise).  The Pirate Fairy grossed $65-mil at the box office alone but the real appeal, as per the rest of the Tinker Bell film series, was the home market.  Though a success on both fronts, I am of the opinion that with a bit more promoting, this one could have been a pretty big box office smash for Disney.  Perhaps not quite Frozen levels of supremacy but certainly on par with Planes.

To my way of reasoning, the closer the Tinker Bell franchise comes to its Peter Pan roots, the stronger its becoming in terms of prose and interesting characters.  Not to suggest that the fairies and their daily coming and goings about Pixie Hallow aren't interesting by themselves, they certainly are.  There is a fantasy element present here that is worth exploring regardless of age or what kind of movies you typically enjoy.  The bigger problem, at least as far as I can tell, has to do with the fact that the films undeniably appeal to girls; a reality only further driven home by the Tinker Bell branding, which, can actually cause many boys to steer clear entirely regardless of how well the story is told.

The Pirate Fairy is the first to do away with the Tinker Bell moniker in its title and the material is finally coming together in a manner where Peter Pans integration into the mythos is on the horizon.  For me, these are some triumphs worth celebrating.

This time we follow along on the exploits of a a misunderstood dust-keeper fairy named Zarina, who steals Pixie Hollow's all-important Blue Dust, in a bid to join forces with a small band of pirates from Skull Rock.  Tinker Bell and her cohorts put all of the pieces together and find themselves little choice but to embark upon a quest upon the high seas in effort to return the crucial Dust to its rightful place in Pixie Hollow.

Comedy and new challenges arise when, in the midst of their pursuit of Zarina, Tinker Bell and her pals respective talents become switched.  The normally confident and in-control group are suddenly out of their respective elements in a hurry and the resulting antics are definitely enjoyable.

Its 78-minute runtime is by far the quickest paced of the current five and with visuals moving away from the innocent forestry setting of the Hollow and into the vast world beyond in undeniable style.  From rolling sea foam to the most generous (and convincing) dust effects to date, The Pirate Fairy is definitive proof that Disneys acquisition of Pixar in 2006 is yielding small dividends all the way across the boards.

The vast majority of the voice talent is unchanged from the rest of the series with the only notable newcomer Christina Hendricks as Zarina.  Her work is spot on and the incredibly talented but consistently underrated Jeff Bennett delivers what it perhaps the most convincing interpretation of John Rhys-Davies as Fairy Gary to date.

All in all I came away from The Pirate Fairy impressed; especially when compared to the earlier entries into the franchise.  The pacing is stronger, the pirate themes (and timeline) approaching the long-awaited integration into the Peter Pan mythos and the fact that Disney is smart enough to recognize that the Tinker Bell label is costing them serious revenue from the XY-chromosome set is encouraging as well.  5th entries into any series are almost expected to have weakened from the original as to be diluted into incoherence yet somehow Disney seems to be becoming more focused with each installment.

Factor in some catchy musical numbers (including an original theme song by Natasha Bedingfield) and a back story reveal sure to delight fans of the original Peter Pan and you have the formula for quite an enjoyable CG-animated romp.  Heres hoping Legend of the NeverBeast manages to carry on in this tradition.",1417651200,,4836,4.789410348977136

Then proceeded to highlight a disobedient fairy named Zarina who felt that rules didn't apply to her because she liked to experiment........with disastrous results.  And when she doesn't get her own way she runs away, free to return a year later and wreck more havoc on the unsuspecting fairy colony.  By that time, I was still waiting for the positive life affirming message to kick in.  I had a long wait.  In a nutshell, this is a story of betrayal and redemption.  The best part was the baby crocodile who seriously needs his own toon.

Since they've just introduced Hook, can Peter be far behind?

6134138,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"Was surprised by how much we (the adults) enjoyed it. The Tinkerbell movies have been pretty good, all of them, but this was the first one that I felt was starting to tie into what will eventually be the meeting of Peter Pan, and I was pleasantly surprised. Liked it better than the Secret of the Wings or that one where she makes the spectre (I forget what its called). Great animation, story moves along quick enough, and my kids (boys included) enjoyed it.",1414022400,,459,4.476190476190476
6134139,5,B00H5RYN5Y,great,1414022400,,5,5.0
6134140,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"Kids love it and we parents can tolerate it just fine. It doesn't contain all the bratty characters that so many other children's movies seem to have these days.

Also, oddly enough, it's not just Tinkerbell who saves the day this time.",1414022400,,236,4.619047619047619
6134141,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"Zarina, a creative Dust Keeper fairy, performs illicit experiments with pixie dust in the privacy of her home. None of these experiments work until it is her turn to learn about the properties of the precious blue dust, which is what replenishes the Pixie Dust Tree. She is excited to find that blue dust was just the ingredient she needs to create many different kinds of dust, each color representing a different fairy talent. In her overenthusiasm at this discovery, she unwittingly causes an accident that destroys the Pixie Dust Depot, where she works. She flees Pixie Hollow in despair after she loses her job as a Dust Keeper. A year later, she returns to put all the Pixie Hollow citizens to sleep during a public celebration and steals the vial of blue dust. Tinker Bell and her friends, who escaped the sleeping spell, chase after Zarina to retrieve the dust. They discover that she not only joined up with a group of Never Land pirates, which includes the future Captain Hook before he was dismembered by Peter Pan, but had become their captain. Zarina plots with them to use stolen pixie dust to make their ship fly so they can travel the world beyond Never Land and plunder every country. It is up to Tinker Bell and her friends to retrieve the dust and see if they can bring Zarina to her senses before its too late.

The Pirate Fairy is a heartwarming movie that emphasizes the power of friendship, teamwork, and forgiveness. Despite her questionable motives, Zarina is exuberant and likeable, a welcome addition to Tinks group of friends. The animation is breathtaking, the music catchyespecially a jaunty pirate song called The Frigate That Fliesand the voice work excellent.  One of the fairies even bonds with the infamous tick-tock-crocodile that, in this film's time frame, is an adorable hatchling.  Even though I enjoyed all the Tinker Bell movies, this one is my hands down my favorite. I hope the series continues!",1413936000,,1939,4.816816816816817

Could have been called the mad scientist fairy, if they were going for accurately describing personalities.  But the pirate outfit was very cute.
The Pirate Fairy is the first Disney Fairy movie to be a musical.  I had liked the other fairy movies without the singing, so I was less than thrilled at this change.  However, it was not overdone, and the song on the pirate ship was quite entertaining.
All in all, I enjoyed this movie as much as the earlier installments in the franchise.

Bake Off - the mini-shorts in this free extra DVD were ok.  Generally fun to watch.  But Mini-Short was right.  The entire dvd is around 17 minutes long.  The title short is 5 minutes, the rest are between 1 minute and a minute and a half each.  Not bad.

Tinkerbell never takes the center stage. That honor goes to the new fairy, Zerina, a tinkerbell-like fairy. The whole movie feels rushed and my daughter, who is usually glued to the screen when we put on tinker movies, lost interest halfway through.

6134344,1,B00H5RYN5Y,"While I can't fault the animation, which looks fairly sharp for such mediocre source material, the problem here is that it becomes apparent that there are prequel elements loosely being incorporated regarding the original classic Disney 'Peter Pan' film, and that's where things fall apart.  Some spoilers: so its a youthful, carefree Captain Hook that goes flying with their fairies, then eventually turns evil?  I suppose, but then why when we get to the classic Peter Pan does Hook's relationship with Tinkerbell (or fairies in general) seem so inconsistent?  He can apparently hear and translate fairy-talk in this film, but that ability is gone in the film?  Likewise, when did Tinkerbell become a sassy, intelligent creature when in the original film she's a spoiled rotten little thing that wants to kill Wendy with a cannon shot, or vainly examines her hip length in a mirror.  Is this the same character?
I wish they would just tell a new story and not try to tie it to the classic source material, but it really just doesn't work.",1404604800,,1040,4.886363636363637

Nothing like Toy Story or other Pixar greats filled with adult humor which make the movies good for parents too. Some parts had me wondering why they included them but were over fast enough to make them tolerable. I'm not sure if I like how beautiful they all these fairies are.  Tink shows a little too much skin for me also.

While Tink did save the day and turn things around at the end of the movie, this movie was dark. The featured character (Zarina) was flat out mean and was (in fact) working for the enemy. OK. She was being duped. She thought she was in charge while she was actually being tricked. But even so - it was NOT the usual fun, happy, friendly story one expects of Tinkerbell.

In retrospect, I wish I had not bought this movie. It is the only one I own, and the only one I wish I did NOT own! So much for trying to be the Good Granny! {I also tried to buy Frozen. Ordered TWO copies of it which were to be delivered before we took Lexy home (per my Prime membership). They arrived LATE so hubby had to go to Walmart and buy one for her. Now I am stuck with an extra one. Good Granny burned twice: Frozen & The Pirate Fairy. No more shopping for DVDs on Amazon for me! Thanks for nothing, Zarina!}

Let's just sum it up this way - my daughter would not let me send it home with my granddaughter!",1404086400,,1262,4.080645161290323

6134365,4,B00H5RYN5Y,"My daughter and I watched this together for our mommy daughter movie night. We have seen all of the Disney Fairy films and We both really enjoyed this one. There may be spoilers in this review so reader beware...
This story is centered around a misunderstood ""different"" fairy with quirks like Tinker Bell. The underlined message is how those who are eccentric can often find it hard to fit in and sometimes stray to anyone who will accept them.. In this case, the lone fairy finds herself accepted by pirates who use her for their own gain. The original fairy group have their talents switched and work together to save pixie hollow and their wayward friend. As an adult, I enjoyed the beautiful animation and origin stories of tic OTC crocodile and Captain Hook, it was well done and Disney Peter Pan friends will enjoy finding these origins throughout the film. My daughter loved the humor, fairy friendships and beautiful design. This is a feel good film with great Disney elements.",1403913600,,986,4.771929824561403

6134368,2,B00H5RYN5Y,"This review is intended for parents, rather than the target audience. First, a little background. The single character of Tinker Bell is (loosely) based on James Barrie's Peter Pan, but the fairy kingdom (called Pixie Hollow) and its inhabitants originate from the recent book trilogy written by the award winning children's writer Gail Carson Levine (in my opinion, a much more talented author than Barrie). The direct to video film series were launched in 2008, with the first three episodes featuring original, surprisingly deep stories and remarkable musical scores (especially the outstanding ""Lost Treasure"", often shown on Disney's cable channels). The last two episodes, produced by a different director, are quite inferior to those, with simpler, less though provoking stories, recycled plot elements and music, and a focus on fashion and pop culture - in other words, similar to the host of low cost TV series featuring pretty looking fairies, mermaids, princesses, and similar characters found on many cable channels. This film is easily the weakest of the series.

The plot is, plainly, dumb and full of holes. The title character is one nasty specimen of fairykind, a criminal and mastermind behind the pirates' evil plans. However, the character is also very pretty and fashion conscious, and so cannot be held accountable for her actions, which are instead blamed on the pirates' bad influence. In the middle of the movie the character switches over to the ""good"" side and evades responsibility. There should have been a remorse scene somewhere, but I looked away for a second or two and so apparently missed it entirely. There is no character development or morale; everything is black and white and clear from the start (there is, however, no shortage of alike looking action sequences despite the short running time). The hero vs. villain/mindless buffoon division is straight along gender lines. The magic and enchanting ambiance of the early episodes are gone. Pixie Hollow now boasts a gaudy sport arena, where crowds of fairies gather to watch circus shows (that look much like Disney on Ice), gulp soft drinks from oversized containers, and follow with an inevitable rush for outdoor lavatories. Still want to believe in fairies after this?

To tell the truth, many pre-teenage children are attracted to this kind of low grade fare (for the same reason they prefer candy to vegetables), and the film studios are well aware of this. The animation is very pretty, and the story is predictable and unencumbered by moral dilemmas (and, if anything, seems to endorse irresponsible behavior). The film is bound to boost sales of (pirate edition!) fashion dolls and similar licensed merchandise. But to those who still remember the magic of the original Peter Pan animated feature, this flick would be a very different experience. Tinker Bell is a unique and historically significant character, and she deserves better than this. Much better.",1403827200,10,2958,5.186192468619247

It's nice having the digital copy and not having to constantly switch the discs out, but have noticed that the digital copy does not have ""chapters"" that allow for skipping through the movie.  You can fast forward, but not skip (if that makes sense).  This is a pain because at night we don't want to watch the entire movie and only want to watch the last 30-45 minutes before getting ready for bed.

6134444,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"I saw this movie on Comcast On-Demand, and IT IS A MUST HAVE for both adult and child Disney fans!  One caution: get the original 1950's Animated Peter Pan movie (or at least Smee it to get all the inside jokes from the original Disney Peter Pan) or the adults will not get the inside jokes which makes The Pirate Fairy such a joy!  Once it gets rolling, there's action, laughs, and even a few wet eyes for the adults.  I saw it at least 5 times, and am still not sure I got all the inside jokes!  Tinker Bell and Zarina  are a perfect match for each other, with enough action for three movies!  Zarina, The Pirate Fairy, makes a perfectly sweet pirate lead character!  21 STARS from a 62 year-old guy who has  believed in Tinker Bell ever since Mary Martin (as Peter Pan) asked all who were watching the made for TV stage play to shout ""Yes! I believe in Fairies!' as loud as they could to make a poisoned Tinker Bell well again!  I hope someone comes out with a line of Halloween/Play Costumes based on all these Fairies for children and adults who still believe in the Magic of Hope!",1401926400,,1086,4.258536585365854
6134445,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"This is a little story about a fairy who makes a mistake and is forgiven for her injury to others.  It teaches about loyalty, about courage, and love.  That may sound cheesy, but to a little 3 year old, it establishes a good pattern of watching wholesome movies.",1401926400,,262,4.4375
6134446,5,B00H5RYN5Y,My daughters absolutely love all the Tinkerbell movies and this one is another great one to have.  Like the story with Captain Hook.,1401926400,,132,4.739130434782608
6134447,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"What can I say, the kids love it.  The quality of the video is good.

They have watched it oh... 100 times at least.  Lately it seems like they are dwindling to twice a day.  Very good value given the cost per watch ratio.

So from an external perspective what the kids seem to like:
- The characters are consistent and fun for young children.
- The songs are catchy and they sing them when not watching it.
- There are pirates, and after they found Jake and the Neverland Pirates, that is darn near their very favorite thing.

And of course the good guys win...",1401926400,,562,4.254716981132075

6134456,4,B00H5RYN5Y,"While I liked this movie fine, it just didn't have the same level of enjoyment for me as the previous ones for some reason.  I suspect it was because they simply tried too hard to tie the story in to the old Peter Pan movie.  It's still definitely worth a watch with the kids, though.",1401840000,,284,4.1454545454545455
6134457,4,B00H5RYN5Y,"This is a real cute, adventerous Disney movie. The protagonists are the pixie faries (just like Tinker Bell) and how they make pixie dust. It also hints at some events and characters that eventually make an appearance in Peter Pan - very clever!

Also, Tom Hiddleston (Loki from the Thor movies) is in it as well, and he does a great job.",1401840000,,338,4.451612903225806

6134469,4,B00H5RYN5Y,Quite an entertaining story which in its later stages suggests that we are looking at the very early history of the Captain Hook of the Peter Pan stories. An interesting addition to the library.,1401667200,2,194,4.735294117647059

6134481,1,B00H5RYN5Y,"You can't spell pirate without irate.  And that is what this movie makes me.

Apparently Tinkerbell has gone over to her ages-old nemeses, the Pirates of Neverland.  This is the kind of backstabbing that I usually see in Sophia the First or Go, Diego, Go!, but not my beloved Tink.  I guess now I'm supposed to believe that trusty ol' Smee is going to join up with the Lost Boys.  Maybe that crazy tick-tocking Crocodile will be best pals with Captain Hook!  MAYBE PETER PAN WILL STOP THINKING HAPPY THOUGHTS AND LOSE THE ABILITY TO FLY BECAUSE TINKERBELL WENT OVER TO THE FREAKING PIRATES!

At least that is what I took from barely listening to it while I fixed dinner and my daughter watched it.  I'm 33.  Don't ask me to rate these movies.",1401235200,2,742,4.477611940298507

6134497,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"This movie has less of Tinkerbell using her tinker talents to solve problem even fairy magic can't solve (which is what I really loved about this series). I try and teach my daughter to solve problems with her mind and hands. I am a very mechanically inclined person and between the first few Tinkerbell movies and my actions around the house it really made my daughter love to fix things and mess with tools.

Pirate Fairy is not like that thought, however, it is still a very good movie. They introduce a new form of Fairy, the dust keepers, which is really cool and expands the large scale view of a living, working, and functioning society within Pixie Hollow. They also introduce a young certain pirate captain and a cute certain reptile that is a wink at another movie.

The moral of the story is a very good one of people taking advantage of others and doing what you know is right. The ""fighting"" if you can call it that is beautifully illustrated. It is a great film, if a little different from the other Pixie Hollow films.",1400976000,,1033,4.48936170212766

But if the original Peter Pan did our parents probably wouldn't have let us kids watch it. I love this movie as much as my girls do, even after the 6th, no 26th viewing...",1400889600,,346,4.338461538461538

Well, he saw a preview for this movie and just kept asking for it so I pre-ordered. He loved it! He loves the songs in it, and the fact that there's a nice little twist/back story at the end (not wanting to give anything away there). I also love that it came with the Disney Movie Rewards and their digital copy. The digital copies for Disney are different than for other movies in that they can be viewed from the Disney Movie Anywhere app and they can also be synched with your iTunes account. I have some ultraviolet digital copies for other movies, and they cannot be synch'd with iTunes. So i can only watch them from the Ultraviolet website.",1400803200,,824,4.392156862745098

6134520,4,B00H5RYN5Y,good. Good girl movie and kids. Kids should realize that you cannot believe everything you hear especially when it does not make sense like her being the captain.  She should have known there would be treason.,1400630400,,209,4.805555555555555

6134555,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"My daughter has recently become interested in the Tinkerbell movies.  I was never much of a fan of the Peter Pan movie, so I was hesitant to get involved in the Tinkerbell franchise.  Tinkerbell in Peter Pan was always grumpy and kind of a troublemaker, but in these other movies, she is friendly, likable and a fun character!  And this latest movie keeps up with that theme.  I like that they made this one more of an ensemble movie with all the fairies and it wasn't just focused on Tinkerbell.  I think they've done a nice job giving each fairy their own quirks and personalities and this one features each one very nicely.  And Zarina is a nice addition to the bunch!  I hope that they continue to have her in future movies.  Plus, I appreciate the subtle introduction of Captain Hook and the crocodile with the clock.  This will definitely be a movie that will get lots of playtime in our household.",1400198400,,904,4.4969325153374236

""Pirate Fairy"" on the other hand is meh.  Jolly fairies on an assembly line, with bad fairy/rebellious Zarina experimenting with a new mixture of pixie dust and.....well, a little of that ""jolly fairies on an assembly line"" goes a long way. Tom Hiddleston under-used as a young Captain Hook.  His cartoon face really not suggesting very much except dorkiness and a desperate effort to be a jolly young pirate.",1400112000,2,605,5.142857142857143

6134570,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"Disney: The Pirate Fairy caught my attention due to my previous enjoyment of watching the Secret Of The Wings last summer. Additionally, I admit that I was also curious to watch it after finding out that Christina Hendricks (Mad Men) is one of the actresses who contributed her voice to this film (for the character of Zarina). Tom Hiddleston (James Hook character) and Angelica Houston (Queen Clarion character) are also among the multiple actors/actresses that give their voices to this animated movie. This movie involves the character of Zarina eventually uses her pixie dust gifts to help out a group of pirate men after being forbidden from working with pixie dust. Zarina succeeds into putting many of the Pixie Hollow residents to sleep at the Four Seasons festival. She then carefully chooses this event to harness the magical blue pixie dust. Tinkerbell and a few of her friends manage to be among the few who are shielded from this energy and follow Zarina to see the plan she is brewing.",1400025600,2,999,4.882352941176471

6134576,4,B00H5RYN5Y,"I came for Tom Hiddleston, I stayed for the fairies. I wanted to see this film because Hiddles was the voice of a young Captain Hook, and he SINGS! Oh god I just faint whenever I hear his section of ""The Frigate That Flies""!

But the story isn't about the pirates of Neverland. It's about the fairies of Pixie Hollow. The gang: Tinkerbell, Vidia, Iridessa, Rosetta, Fawn and Silvermist, returns and this time they have to rescue some blue pixie dust from a renegade fairy named Zarina (who's voiced by Christina Hendricks of ""Mad Men"" fame). But Zarina's talent is mixing dust colors for different fairy talents and she's got a few tricks up her sleeves. Can Tink and the gang stop her? Can they redeem her? What's Captain Hook plan for the blue dust?

This very film made me a fan of the Disney Fairies. After watching it, I went to Netflix to watch the other titles in the Disney Fairies mythos: ""Tinkerbell"", ""Tinkerbell and the Lost Treasure"", ""Tinkerbell and the Great Fairy Rescue"" and  ""The Secret of the Wings"". I even went to YouTube to watch all the shorts (I've already read the books). And I loved them all. I realized that I'm more of a Disney Fairy girl than a Disney Princess girl, especially after being disappointed by ""Brave"" and ""Frozen"". Now it's on to buy some (age-appropriate) merchandise!

Anyway the bottom line is: these movies are good. This latest installment is a worthy addition to your collection whether it's a fairy collection, a Disney collection, or a Tom Hiddleston collection.

I look forward to ""Legend of the Neverbeast""!",1399939200,,1560,4.720588235294118

6134592,4,B00H5RYN5Y,"We and our 4-year-old really liked this movie. The Zarina character is interesting, and encourages curiosity and exploration. As a parent of daughters, all of these Tinker Bell movies are valuable because of the primary roles of females. This movie is funny at times and has plenty of action, with a running theme of forgiveness.

A bit of caution, however. We love the other four Tinker Bell movies because of the almost total lack of violence. This movie breaks from that a bit. Throughout the second half of the movie, there are several scenes where pirates are trying to catch fairies using swords and knives. No character is a real victim of violence, per se, but if there were degrees within the G rating, this one would be closer to PG than the first four films. Still, it was not an issue for my 4-year-old. She loved it.",1399593600,,829,4.601351351351352

This also explains about the Crocodile having the clock in it's stomach and a little more of the background for Captain Hook all the while delivering an entertaining story around the fairies and the fairy dust!  Like most Disney movies, it is sweet and entertaining!",1399593600,,385,4.907692307692308
6134596,5,B00H5RYN5Y,Fun new twist on the Disney Fairy sagas!  This appealed to both my 5 and 6 year olds . . . boy and girl.  Fun Fairy sequel and I love how they worked in Captain Hook!  You'll have to watch it to get it.  Worth the purchase!,1399507200,,223,3.6808510638297873
6134597,5,B00H5RYN5Y,We laughed out loud throughout the movie! Great family film! Love how they introduce Captain Hook into the film! And the Tic-Toc-Croc!,1399507200,,134,5.136363636363637
6134598,4,B00H5RYN5Y,"I didn't hate it, but it didn't hold my interest like a Pixar or theatrical Disney film can. These are made exclusively for kids, and my daughter loved it. So I guess it's a success on that level. The blu-ray, DVD, digital copy combo make it a reasonable value. If your kids like the other Tinker Bell movies, they'll most probably like this one too.",1399507200,,350,4.4

6134602,3,B00H5RYN5Y,"Warning:  This review contains spoilers.

My family has loved all of the Pixie Hollow/ Tinker Bell movies prior to this.  In fact, we watch them so much that we had had a conversation the day before watching The Pirate Fairy regarding how they might incorporate Captain Hook and Peter Pan into the overall story arch.  The Pirate Fairy answers the question regarding Captain Hook.  Unfortunately, it did not do it well.  The story was weak.  There is nothing more to say than that.  We enjoyed it.  It was fun to watch, but it was just not as strong as the previous movies.",1399507200,,573,4.53921568627451

6134605,4,B00H5RYN5Y,"I bought this with the intention of letting the grandkids watch it.  It has the typical ""goody-2-shoes"" attitude for most of the cartoon, but there is enough humor to keep it interesting.  Kids will be glued to the set.  The colors and music seem to have captivated them.",1399420800,,271,4.604166666666667

6134609,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"I absolutely adored The Pirate Fairy. For one, the baby crocodile. For everything else, it was just so wonderful to watch that I couldn't tear myself away from it. I think the Tinker Bell movies are not only adorable but something that every Disney fan should watch, no matter how young or old you are. The storylines are always very different and this one was special because it featured the debut of Captain Hook, voiced by Tom Hiddleston. I loved this because I really hope we get to see more of Neverland (and maybe Peter Pan!) in future movies.

Tink and her friends were wonderful to watch again as all of their abilities are mixed up by a pesky pirate fairy. I have to admit that I laughed aloud a few times during their adventure and was really wrapped up in seeing how it would all end.

I definitely think this movie is worth buying because it's one that I'll watch myself again and again. I want to plan a movie night for it as well! This is a fun adventure that will give you plenty of happy thoughts.",1399334400,,1013,4.354497354497354

6134616,4,B00H5RYN5Y,Our granddaughters loved it.  This is definitely a movie for the young set.  It's a good story and is a precursor to the Peter Pan story.,1399334400,,137,4.230769230769231
6134617,4,B00H5RYN5Y,Enjoyable for my Granddaughter. Liked the back story of Capt. Hook. Showed the meaning of friendship and forgiveness. Tink and her friends saved the day.,1399334400,,153,5.16

6134623,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"My boys are typical boys - cars, trucks, animals and dirt, but they also LOVE Tinkerbell. This movie is really cute and I realized (as a veteran Disney movie lover) that it is the story of how Captain Hook became Captain Hook of Peter Pan and how the Gator swallowed the clock.

What's really nice is to finally see some expanded universe tie-ins with Peter Pan, but I worry that in doing so, Disney is going to bring the Disney Fairies series to a close. However, this should not detract from the experience; I'm sure that your kids will love it, and you will too! The story of friendship, forgiveness, and understanding is something that even us adults can do with. The reminder is good for the soul.",1399248000,,507,4.644444444444445

6134633,5,B00H5RYN5Y,Great movie.  My grandaughter loves it.  Thought it could have been released to theaters before being put out on DVD. It's that good.,1399248000,,133,4.739130434782608

6134638,3,B00H5RYN5Y,"It is Tinkerbell, so your kids will probably like it.  Mine did

However, this movie takes a serious departure from the strong nature themes of the other movies in a try hard effort for Disney to bring your little girls on board with their ""pirates are for everyone!"" cash cow marketing that they have been trying to plaster all over their parks.  Pirates were very bad, scary people, I hope I won't live to see how ""Carlito the friendly cocaine smuggler"" gets turned into a fun children's character.

I think that the biggest disappointment and wag of the finger that I have for Disney is how this movie takes a serious moral turn away from the plot focusing on social morality (like it did with the other kids movies) to now glamorizing a fairy and friends who are full on criminal.  Good Job Disney, you're really helping our kids keep the lessons straight.",1399248000,,860,4.594771241830065

6134642,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"This movie is the 5th in the Disney Fairies collection and Im certain it will not be the last.  The story involves just a few fairies and most of the story takes part far away from Pixie Hollow.  The story line is good and the mixed up talents is quite comical especially Vidia's changed talent.

My 5 year old daughter really liked everything about the movie and has watched it many times. In fact i bought here a brush with blue pixie dust inside and now she gets her Tinkerbell and re-enacts the movie.

The best part of this particular fairy movie is you get to see how the Peter Pan movie ties into the fairy movies.  Technically that is the first Tinkbell movies and these are all before that.  Up to this point i had no clue of how things would ever change.  You'll get to meet the young Captain Hook who has always been a sneaky snook.  The best part is you learn how tick-tock-croc came to be and why he dislikes Hook so much.

My only complaint with any of the fairy movies is they leave you wanting more.",1399161600,,1015,4.244791666666667

Gee, if I'd had any idea what I was missing, I'd have tried to get some of the others because this was really fun and had a nice little 'lesson' in it, too.  Admittedly, I only bought it for (ta-duh!) the vocal talents of one Mr Thomas William Hiddleston (Loki from Thor and The Avengers) and figured it would be kind of cutesy and maybe worth viewing once.  I was pleasantly surprised and have since loaned it to co-workers who also enjoy Disney.  The 'bonus' features were an added benefit - quite informative and entertaining.  .Defintely worth the price of admission.",1398902400,,717,4.658730158730159

But the plot was shallow and just wasn't as interesting. The animation was still pretty and the soundtrack was Okay, but for adults this one doesn't have re-watch value like the other ones. Which in our house is a big problem!

I wish there was more focus on the fairies and their relationships rather than the pirates.

The new fairy messes up and gets fired from being a Dust fairy. Then she disappears for a year. (Let's forget for a second that Tinkerbell screws up all the time, and never got fired from her Tink position) But what, her friends didn't go looking for her? Then they act like they wanted her back all along? The message seems to be 'don't give up on your friends' but they gave up on her first.",1398902400,4,804,4.346666666666667

6134716,4,B00H5RYN5Y,"I confess...I bought ""The Pirate Fairy"" for the voice acting. I expected to enjoy the performances by Tom Hiddleston and Christina Hendricks, but write off the movie as a whole. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised -- while clearly a movie aimed at a much younger audience than myself, the story was solid, the music was catchy (I even downloaded ""The Frigate That Flies"" from iTunes), and the movie as a whole was pretty entertaining.",1398556800,,434,4.878378378378378

6134720,4,B00H5RYN5Y,"Rented this for my son who had been asking to watch it. My boyfriend was skeptical, I didn't mind renting it as I enjoy the shows when they are on Disney Junior, my boyfriend laughed along with us though and was pleasantly surprised. The pirate elements were well done and though out, although highly predictable if you know your Peter Pan.

Cant wait to see more as they develop this next leg of Tinker Bells story.",1398470400,,416,4.473684210526316

6134726,5,B00H5RYN5Y,We own all of the Tinker Bell movies and this lives up to the same quality and story line.  Other characters really take center stage over Tinker Bell which is fine and opens up a whole new path for Disney to expand on the Fairies story - even a young Captain Hook!,1398384000,,265,4.096153846153846

6134740,4,B00H5RYN5Y,"This was a really cute movie.  One thing is though I'm a little sick of movies showing people (or fairies) making seriously bad, destructive choices and then having really no consequences.  In real life, we don't all just hug the thief who tried to destroy our civilization and then make up.  I guess lots of kids shows are like that, but its getting on my nerves.  Bad choices have serious consequences.",1398211200,,404,4.647887323943662
6134741,4,B00H5RYN5Y,"Not the greatest kids movie I have seen, but this is not nearly as painful to sit though as some of the things we watch. Like all of the fairy movies, it is entertaining, and I didn't notice any thing that was bad for our 4 year old. Some mild violence that was more comedic then any thing else. It is worth a buy.",1398211200,,314,3.921875

6134743,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"When my 3 year-old daughter requested we watch a tinkerbell movie on Netflix, I was less than ecstatic.  I thought, Tinkerbell??? You don't want to watch ANYTHING else?  Nope, she wanted tinkerbell, so we watched the first movie in the series.  I was pleasantly surprised that it was not bad at all.  Sure, it's not Harry Potter or Star Wars, but it was a good little story and my daughter was happy (and that's all that matters, right?).

Well, when this one came out, we pre-ordered it and dropped $20 bucks on it for her since she loves Tinkerbell so much.  I've seen 3 of the tinkerbell movies with her, and this one was by far the best!  The colors and scenery are beautiful (I especially loved the little festival at the beginning of the movie).  The story was fantastic as well.  My favorite part is seeing a younger Hook and baby Tick-Tock from Peter Pan... loved how the story tied into Peter pan!

I should note that even after the tenth re-watch of ""Tinkerbell Arrrrrrr!"" (this is what my daughter calls it), I still find that I'm enjoying myself while watching it.",1398211200,2,1076,4.528497409326425

6134753,1,B00H5RYN5Y,"This is probably the least coherent film I have ever seen and the worst disney film ever made.  It unfolds like a bad episode of Pokemon. There is no story here whatsoever, just a bunch of idiotic, obnoxious characters that are destroying our youth and our future.  It is 100% visuals and that is disturbing to me.  It's like they started with the animations and said we'll worry about the story later.  You'd probably have to do a lot of drugs to understand what's going on.  Save your money and watch secret of the wings instead.",1398124800,3,531,4.489583333333333
6134754,5,B00H5RYN5Y,My husband says this is his favorite Fairy movie so far.  My daughter was very excited when she figured out it was Captain Hook.  I like how they are incorporating things that adults can link to the Fairy/Peter Pan stories they know.  My favorite is seeing how the tick-tock croc came to be - very cute.,1398124800,,303,4.375

6134762,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"Both my granddaughters have watched it multiple times since I downloaded this on Kindle Fire - they've said things like this is their favorite Tinker Bell movie, yet.

6134763,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"My children, ages 6 and 4, both LOVE this movie.  My daughter received this two-disc Blu-ray/dvd + digital copy combo pack from the Easter bunny.  In the last 24 hours, my children have already watched this movie TWICE!  This family friendly movie is sure to delight viewers of all ages.  As you might expect from Disney, the video quality is amazing--this is true even when watching the digital format on the Kindle fire--and the sounds effects astounding.  This latest TB movie, is full of swashbuckling pirates, exciting sword fights, and non-stop adventure on the high seas.  It also includes some really fun songs.  All the favorite fairies from the previous TB movies are featured in this one, including Tinker Bell (of course), Silvermist, Rosetta, and Iridessa, to name a few.  And of course, there are several brand new characters to meet and enjoy!  My 4 year old son says ""this is the best Tinker Bell movie ever!""  As for my daughter, well this is her newest favorite movie--right after ""Frozen"" that is.  LOL",1398038400,,1021,4.84393063583815

This movie follows suit with the female characters being empowered and adventurous. Plus, there are pirates!",1397952000,,261,4.954545454545454
6134768,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"This movie was better than frozen. It had good messages for children and it wasn't trying to self merchandize. The songs complemented the movie, not overpowered it. Also, even though the animation was a little stiff it was intricate and well thought out. The plot was great and the talents of the fairies were well used within that.",1397952000,,332,4.741379310344827
6134769,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"Like the other Disney fairy movies before, this is a good and solid movie for kids. My 8 year old daughter loves it. Lessons of stretching (tempered with learning to work carefully) and forgiveness. As well as learning that everyone doesn't always mean what they say, sometimes people need time to step back in order to forgive and understand.

Too bad that, in spite of having pre-ordered it on the first day it was available for pre-order, Amazon didn't deliver it until a WEEK AFTER it was released. Next time, I'll just go to the local Wal-mart on the day of release and pick it up there. Had it done it that way, we would have had it in time for my daughter's birthday rather than late.

6134822,3,B00H5RYN5Y,"My 2 yr old grand daughter and I Love Tinkerbelle. Pirate Fairy couldn't come fast enough for us. I ordered it through amazon prime. It couldn't keep our attention.  It centers on a fairy gone bad when an innocent invention goes awry and she is kicked to the curb. She joins a pirate ship and becomes a pain in the arse to tink and her friends.  They see through her ""bad girl"" and all ends well. We lost interest after 15 minutes. I consider it a waste of $15.00.",1397433600,2,464,4.202247191011236

A year later she returns to steal the Blue Dust as both revenge and the ultimate proof that she was right all along.  It is up to Tinkerbell and her friends track down Zarina and convince her to do the right thing before it is too late.

I loved this movie for a few really pertinent reasons.  1) The fairies are forced out of their comfort zone, and are required to work together in a way they have never imagined.  2)  False flattery plays a huge role.  3)  Lessons in forgiveness and regret come to play in the end.",1397433600,,632,4.208333333333333

He met thr kids at the door and immediately started spreading the word that he knew a great family movie that each of them should try and see that very same night!!!  So, not only was this movie magical in of itself watching it's,,it actually allowed for our boy,it also have him the courage to initiate in an appropriate conversstion and so stuck to conversation on more than one occasion but each time he caught someone new to entering the pool area , he proudly wrote the rules down too which is another win for us as parents, due to his opposition to writing.  Super proud of our boy turning everything around.  Even if it doesn't last, the experiences this weekend, spoke volumes!? Just the same as the movie !",1397433600,,875,4.382716049382716

6134837,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"We watched this with our 4 year old and we all loved it. It was funny and adventurous. There was never a slow moment and we found ourselves laughing so much throughout the movie. When I first saw the preview for it I didn't think it was going to be a good edition to the Fairy series, but it shows how Captain Hook and his flying ship came about.

They basically wrapped a piece of cardboard around it, along with a pacifier clip I purchased, and taped it tightly. Needless to say, the clip was dented down into the DVD.

6134853,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"In his book about the Pixar challenges and triumphs, Creativity Inc., Ed Catmull describes how the role of the ""Brain Trust"" in making the best films possible -- and their record speaks for itself. As part of Disney, Pixar has inspired their ""Story Trust,"" which is actually mentioned on one of the bonus features.

Clearly this system, while not infallible, works, because The Pirate Fairy has one of the tightest and fastest paced stories of not just the Disney Fairies series, but direct to video films in general. Of all the Fairies films, this one ranks alongside my favorite in the series, Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue.

But you'll notice that ""Tinker Bell"" does not appear in the title. Perhaps it's because the Disney Fairies franchise has proven so strong, it alone can carry a film, with Tinker Bell as almost a supporting character.

The star of this film is the title character, an inquisitive, ADD fairy named Zarina who, in a strangely Breaking Bad kind of plot, uses her talents as a chemist (or ""alchemist"") to use the -- yes -- ""blue"" pixie dust to create a line of multi-purpose dusts. When her plans cause chaos and she is chastised, she turns to a life of piracy on the high seas.

Christina Hendricks (Joan Holloway-Harris on Mad Men), turns in her third vocal performance for animation, preceded by Goro Miyazaki's From Up On Poppy Hill and as Lois Lane in All-Star Superman. Tom Hiddleston, of The Avengers and War Horse, has a blast playing and singing her assistant pirate, John (as he demonstrates in another bonus feature).

Though there are quite a few excellent direct to video animated features, some of them tend to sag after the first 20-30 minutes. This one never does. It's slam-bang adventure/fantasy, with lots of visual eye candy, character-based humor and a fine score by Joel McNeely.

Compared to other currently releasing options I would give this movie a resounding 5*, but in relation to the previous ""Tinkerbell"" movies, it is a strong 4*. The misstep I refer to is character development between Jim and Zarina that takes place off-screen. This decreases the emotional impact of the third act.

If you read credits at the end names don't sound american and the info at the very last on copyright leads me to think UK now owns Disney. Guess they think Americans who buy their movies don't deserve 3d maybe we should boycott their products for a yr see if they change their tune.

6134877,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"Being that the original Peter Pan was by far my favorite Disney movie of all time made this new branch of tinker bell movies particularly intriguing. But if there was a single thing you could criticize the original for was that the story didn't really have a beginning or an end, just vague history that is briefly touched on. And after four entries into this tinker bell franchise with I and no doubt many others wondering what any of this has to do with the original we now finally have a story line that makes sense. I really hope they continue to thread together this franchise and incorporate it with the classic story that made all of us love tinker bell to begin with.",1397088000,,675,4.451612903225806

6134880,4,B00H5RYN5Y,"Ive never really liked the original Disney Peter Pan animated movie.  Peter was mostly self-involved, the Lost Boys were ignorant thugs, and Tinker Bell was vain, vindictive, jealous, bi-polar, and perhaps slightly psychotic.  All the females in Neverland (including Indians, mermaids, fairies, and Wendy) were enthralled with Peter Pan but the best a girl could strive to be was his surrogate mother.  I felt sorry for Captain Hook by the end of it.
  The original animated Tinker Bell is probably best remembered as a beautiful example of character design and animated fluidity and expressiveness.  Her elevation to Disney mascot, however, seemed more like a corporate board room decision.  Then came the new Tinker Bell series in new(ish) computer animation.  They had to get it right out of the gate and almost forget the personality tics of first popular incarnation of Tinker Bell.  They did that and did it very well.
  Ill give this newest movie four stars because it still maintains emotional resonance and effective story pacing and because I find it hard to kick a project thats so much better than most of the dreck out there, even if its starting to falter compared to the previous episodes in the series.  This one is dark, with the first attempts at actually killing a fairy by an antagonist (if you don't count the hawk in the first movie and, well, the cat and rats).  Tinker Bell is far from the focus in fact she doesnt have much to do except exposition for the audience.  It also seems like the animation is missing something.  The character animation looked a little simpler.  The biggest problem is the approach of the Peter Pan storyline.  This Tinker Bell would never fit that original movie treatment no matter how they wedge her in and if Peter Pan ever appears, even as a baby, thatll be the end of our interest.",1397001600,,1839,4.787301587301587

6134884,2,B00H5RYN5Y,Don't waste your money on this one.  Wait until it is $3.99 to purchase.  The preview paints a totally different movie.  The characters are shallow and the plot is weak.  The fairies have personalities of modern day dumb teenagers who seem to forget their magic powers when they get in a bind but other times are able to use their magic powers.  My 3 year old even questioned some of the inconsistencies of this film.  I am surprised Disney put their name on it.  Thankfully they have a great marketing team to get people like me to give them $20 for it.,1397001600,5,554,4.372549019607843
6134885,1,B00H5RYN5Y,"First off, the movie itself is great, but given the option of watching through amazon instant video or the DVD/Blu ray, Im going with the disc every time.  I bought the Blu ray version which included a digital copy, and amazon was the choice I took, and while it says HD in the listing, its far from that.  It took over a minute to even focus from what I can only say was unwatchable footage, it felt as if I was trying to view it underwater.  When it did sharpen up, by the players own 'connection' box I was up to 480p.. not even close to HD, and my laptop is only a year old, my display is perfectly capable, not to mention Netflix always looks great.  On a side note, the ""directions"" to get it to play on a tablet were so vague, after 30 minutes of fiddling and searching and attempting, I could not get it to work, so there goes the ""free digital copy"" portion of my purchase that for all intents and purposes, I am unable to claim and therefore worthless to me.

This digital system needs to be greatly improved, especially for those that actually purchase a copy this way.. had I spent the money online I would be demanding a refund.

5 stars for the film and the discs, 1 star for the digital version and its implementation.",1396915200,,1233,4.247863247863248
6134886,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"Another great animated film in the Tinkerbell series. What a contrast to Disney's animated film ""Frozen"", which IMHO was terrible.

How can Disney make an excellent series of Tinkerbell films and then make a rotten film like ""Frozen?

My wife and I love this Tinkerbell franchise. It's a delight for adults as well as children.

Many thanks to John Lasseter and to all connected with this wonderful series of animated films.

Cheers Disney!

But please Disney, no more movies like ""Frozen"" where the plot, characterization, and humour took a back seat to way too many bad/inappropriate songs sung by people with poor singing voices. So much more could have been done to make Frozen a quality film like this one. I can't believe all the people who paid for all the movie ""hype"" (including me sad to say.)

I have to join the minority here who does not like this movie. However, even professional reviewers, such as the HDD (High Def Digest) reviewer, agree that this one does not fit with the others. The Tinker Bell sets are always visually breath-taking and have wholesome messages which take me back to an innocent time of life. This Tinker Bell tries too hard to work in a connection to Peter Pan - let us not forget that the Tinker Bell in that movie is jealous and vengeful.

6134910,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"We have loved all of the Tinkerbell movies (except my daughter was a bit afraid of Secret of the Wings). This one is so much fun, so much action and introduces pieces of other movie puzzles that all the parents grew up with but never knew.

Super great movie to watch with your littles",1396828800,,285,4.277777777777778

6134914,4,B00H5RYN5Y,My daughter enjoyed this new Disney movie.  It is great that Disney makes good movies for DVD release.  It is nice to have a new movie for grainy days.  I love that Disney has the digital access code in its Blue Ray movie purchases.,1396828800,,232,4.2272727272727275

This movie is very interesting, entertaining and. Thoroughly enjoyable to watch.  There is a definite storyline, it helps explains how the 'croc' came to haunt Captain Hook, and he came in to existences also.  I would encourage all adults who are kids at heart to purchase Disney's latest movie,pop up a bog bowl popcorn, butter is optional, get something cold to drink, put the DVD in and sit back and enjoy a entertaining fairy movie with Tinkerbell and all the new fairies.  You won't regret it.",1396828800,,661,4.672413793103448

6134920,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"I loved Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen and plenty of other animated films but I didn't realize that the Tinker Bell movies that Disney has been making is of very high caliber as well.  I wouldn't quite rank the Tinker Bell movies up with something like Frozen, but they're still movies that are worth every penny and are fun for the whole family.  As a 30 year old male, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the Tinker Bell animated films, I never would have even gave them a glance if it wasn't for my girlfriend and that's a pity.

I do caution that some of the trailer videos for the Tinker Bell movies are really bad.  They make the movies look like they're made for children.  Take a look at some of the other segments of the films on YouTube to get a better idea that these movies are *NOT* just for kids.",1396742400,,804,4.228758169934641

There is always some kind of problem to solve, but no real evil, and an emphasis on the magical world of the fairies.  That is really all she needs.  I blindly purchased this based on the other movies.  The pirates are mean, and are the center of the story.  For a little girl who loves fairies, it was very disturbing that Zarina makes the young Hook fly, only to be captured by him and his men, and nearly drowned.  My daughter cried in fear and horror.  I am sad that this series seems to be taking a turn toward suspense and drama that is just not appropriate for the age group that the other movies were targeting.

6134929,5,B00H5RYN5Y,This movie comes closest to fitting in with the Peter Pan movies. Actually its an out and out prequil. The action beats all of the Pan movies. The story doesn't suffer for the acting or the many tie ins. They got Hook just about right. I can't figure what they could have done better.,1396656000,,284,4.277777777777778

I find that The Pirate Fairy  is  a movie that  could be considered a prequal to Peter Pan. You get introduced to a few characters who you see Peter Pan.,1396656000,,280,4.148148148148148

6134938,3,B00H5RYN5Y,"Here's a ""Way to overthink it Dad"" opinion from a Father way outside of the target demographic. It's got Fairy Pirates, it's got Adventure and it's got Hiddleston. What could go wrong?

Fairy Pirates:
The biggest problem I've had with the Fairies is that there's 6 of them but they share so many characteristics and are rarely separated anyway that each one is interchangeable with the other. So the entire ""Fairy Power Switch"" was ineffective because it really didn't matter if the Water Fairy suddenly became the Wind Fairy. It's like holding a pen in your left hand rather than your right. Maybe you won't write as well as usual but you can still write.

Adventure:
The other films didn't try to hide that they were going to be a very simplistic kids drama where ""The Power of Friendship will bring us together"". But Pirate Fairy looked different in that it was a pure adventure. There's a Pirate Fairy, lets go get her, Arrrr.

Unfortunately, the films premise was a sampling of every other Fairies movie and that ""Swashbuckling Adventure"" was limited to one scene. My daughter, who is a gigantic Fairies fan, wandered out of the room twice out of boredom. I'm glad we're teaching about ""The Power of Friendship"" to our kids, but how about a new lesson for once?

Hiddleston:
I don't have Loki-Fever like so many (m)others, but I do respect Hiddleston as an actor so I was glad to hear he was cast as Young Hook. The problem is that his celebrity seems to have made every reviewer blinded by the fact that he was completely miscast.

These Fairy movies are supposed to be an extension of the Peter Pan mythology. So considering Hook has such a distinct low voice with a very exaggerated accent then why was he portrayed here as a prissy high pitched englishman?

Overall, I rate this as the Best of the Disney Fairy movies. But I'd still only give it a C so that isn't saying much.",1396656000,2,1885,4.578635014836795

6134957,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"My 5 year old loves this movie, and she's already watched over 6 times.  However, there's a song at the end called ""Weightless"" by Natasha Bedingfield, which I've never heard before, but it was such a great song for the movie. My daughter was even trying to sing along to it.  I bought it and put it on her ipad, but unfortunately as we listened to the full version, the singer says the ""B"" word at least 4 times. I immediately deleted it. Obviously, Disney did some editing and only used the chorus, but I still found this to be irresponsible. Disney should know after almost 50 years of movies, that the songs in their films are always a hit.  Kids sing along to them and parents try to get soundtracks.  Just like the songs from Frozen.  It was a really bad move to put a good song into the movie, in which the full version is not kid appropriate",1396483200,5,849,4.28125

6134973,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"I'm a fan of the Disney animated/CG-animated films since I was a kid. Tinker Bell is still a ironic and the best famous Disney star from the 1953 classic animated film ""Peter Pan"". I wanted to be an animator/storyboard artist but my  job counselor said that he couldn't help deaf people, like me, find the dream job. Damn.

""The Pirate Fairy"" is the best one of the five Tinker Bell film series! Zarina is a misunderstood dust-keeper fairy banished from Pixie Hollow. She later became the pirate fairy and the captain of the human pirates of Neverland. No bad fairies? No fairy villains? Never mind. Tinker Bell and her friends become the new pirate fairies, led by Captain Zarina. Aye!

All Disney films are available to have the English SDH (Subtitles for Deaf and Hard-of-hearing), Spanish, French, and foreign subtitles. Aye!",1396396800,3,829,4.865248226950355
6134974,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"Spoilers below.

In just 24 hours, my family has watched this through 3 times already!  Cute story, great new character:  Zarina, a Dust Keeper fairy who is curious about the mysteries of Pixie Dust, and does some experimenting with unexpected consequences.  When Zarina makes a mess of one of her experiments, Fairy Gary relieves her of her Dust Keeping duties -- permanently.  Zarina leaves Pixie Hollow.  We later find out that she joins up with Pirates when she returns to Pixie Hollow to steal the BLUE pixie dust!

The story that follows about Zarina's fall from grace and her rise again is full of suspense, drama, and humor.  Tinkerbell and her friends get a taste of each others' talents, and we're introduced to the pirate first mate James, who will some day become Captain James T. Hook.  We also see how baby Tick-Tock Crock is born and comes to swallow a ticking clock.

If you watch the credits, you even see Mr. Smee!

This was an exciting edition to the Disney Fairies series.  My girls are 5 and 7 and just love these movies.  Peter Pan has always been my own favorite Disney movie and story from childhood, so it's really exciting to see some introductions to Pan's story.  I've been wondering when Disney would get to the story of how Tinkerbell comes to be Peter's companion.  It's on the horizon, but I do hope this series will last several more movies.  So much more to tell!  There is a brief preview of another Tinkerbell story at the beginning of the Bluray disc, but merely says 'coming soon.'  With the time gap between the last few fairy movies, I'll take that 'soon' with a grain of salt.

It's hard to choose our favorite Tinkerbell movie, they're all so good!  This one is fantastic and already a family favorite.",1396396800,24,1744,4.60064935064935

6134976,5,B00H5RYN5Y,It's another great Tinker Bell movie. My daughter was excited to see another new movie. It's perfect for the time with the popularity of Jake and the Neverland pirates.,1396396800,4,168,4.827586206896552
6134977,2,B00H5RYN5Y,"We own all of the Tinkerbell movies and have watched them numerous times. We have thoroughly enjoyed them all, until this one. To begin with, the main character is not very likeable. There is not enough time spent on her character development to feel that you know the character. She even looks different than the other fairies. More like a human.

The plot would have been more believable and entertaining if the pirates had been a rogue band of misfit fairies that had been banned from Pixie Hollow . Although, it would have changed whole premise that James is the future Captain Hook and the lead in to the Peter Pan story. Zarena as the Captain just seems ridiculous and her fate too predictable.

Zarena is the main issue. She seems to have no real redeemable qualities. She never even apologizes for stealing the fairy dust or capturing Tink and the gang, or thanks them for rescuing her. My girls (5 and 10) were the ones that commented on that.

We usually love Disney movies but this one is a dud! Don't waste your money.",1396396800,10,1030,4.556756756756757

6134979,4,B00H5RYN5Y,"What an absolute gem.  Every one of the voice actors put their all into their roles and obviously enjoyed their work.  This kind of enthusiasm is just delightful to listen to. Charming animation, wonderful characters, and a story about how one can do something very naughty and still be loved and cared about by one's friends. This is a good message for small children, and a good reminder for adults. I also really enjoyed the little nods to continuity with the Peter Pan films.  Highly recommended for all ages.",1396310400,2,513,4.741573033707865

6134981,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"My girls and son loved it! It was an amazing adventure and tons of fun, lots of laughs and a great introduction for Captain Hook and Tick Tock Crock. Even had a good lesson to be learned. Disney does an amazing job again!",1396310400,,221,4.162790697674419
6134982,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"Given that Disney is an essentially American company, I am beyond baffled how they continue to shaft the loyal U.S. consumer.

The new Pirate Fairy movie is actually currently in U.K. theaters in 3D.

Here in the U.S., the movie is a direct to home release with NO Blu-ray 3D disc, just like the Frozen mess.  Except this time, there is no option to import the Blu-ray 3D version from the U.K. since it is still in theaters, assuming there will be a region-free U.K. Blu-ray 3D at all as there is for Frozen.

If you want to watch it in 3D at home in the U.S., you have to pay thirty-five dollars on VUDU, which under the best of circumstances still isn't going to be like watching it on Blu-ray.  I do like VUDU, but this is not a fair solution at this high price.

So, will it be released later?  Is this a typical Disney double-dip money grab?  Only greedy Disney marketing execs know, but their recent bizarre decisions on U.S. Blu-ray 3D releases is annoying to say the least.  3D is here to stay and dominates the brick and mortar theater multiplexes, so this just seems like another way to get dedicated Disney fans to pay multiple times for the same film in an even shorter time period than has previously been the case with improved quality re-releases on DVD / Blu-ray / Blu-ray 3D over the past two decades.

For those not enamored with 3D either at home or in the theater, I feel truly sorry for your inability to see what others can see, as this is about as close to the Star Trek Holodeck as the average consumer can get.  Maybe you're watching it on a cheap TV?  See it on a 4K passive 3D set in 1080p and you'll be hooked.  The format is truly phenomenal and doesn't cost much more for the studio to include the 3D disc in the package as has been done for years.  This just smacks of avarice, plain and simple.  Will I rebuy this in 3D if it finally gets re-released?  Yes, of course, but the marketing paradigm is still a disturbing new trend from the Disney corporate juggernaut.

The Pirate Fairy film itself is probably a great product based on the previous films in this series, especially given that the Secret of the Wings in 3D was just wonderful, so no stars will be docked here for the content as we haven't been disappointed yet by any of the Disney Fairy films.  However, horrid treatment of the American consumer by Disney, as usual.  Pathetic.",1396310400,13,2373,4.376712328767123
6134983,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"Oh, how excited my children and I were learn that The Pirate Fairy movie would be releasing to Disney Blu-ray/DVD & digital copy on the 1st of April! This movie is the fifth in the DisneyFairies collection and I'm most certain with such a overwhelmingly loved response from fans both young and old, it won't be the last.  This movie we found to be non-stop full of action and fun songs from those fancifully fun fairy friends.  The story obviously centers highly on pirates  and most of the adventure takes part on the high seas! I thought the imagery looked very good!

**Spoiler Alert **

My nearly six year old daughter really liked everything about the movie and has watched it many times. I will have to say it was quite a treat to learn all about dust keeper fairy Zarina and what choices made turned her to becoming a pirate fairy. And if you remember, pirates aren't really thought highly upon in the world of Tinkerbell. In fact, this spunky fairy gets tangled up with a pirate we will all come to learn it Captain Hook himself! Tinkerbell and her friends set off on a mission to set things right and oh what an adventure that was! The tick-tock-croc even makes an appearance! Speaking of which, there's a whole bonus feature about crocodiles that we found to be quite educational as it was fun! Even I learned a thing or two! Other bonuses included a few shorts, sing-a-long songs, and more!

We would highly recommend checking The Fairy Pirate out! Any lover of Tinker Bell and the Disney Fairy movies are sure to be pleased. The run-time is about 90 minutes and there's much more playtime with all the included bonus features! Kids will learn about the importance of friendship, never giving up, self-discovery, & forgiveness. Overall, we can't say enough good things!",1396137600,46,1780,4.6528662420382165

6134986,5,B00H5RYN5Y,"I watched this with boy (5 and 7) and my 2 year old daughter and we all loved it.  We have seen all the Tinker Bell Fairy movies and this one is by far our favorite.  I think the whole pirate theme helps it appeal to boys more as well.  The animation is incredible and colorful and the story line adorable.  It of course turns out to be all good in the end and there is lots of adventure in the meantime.  Zarina is a whole new fairy and its fun to see new fairy talents.  We will be watching this one over and over.  I was surprised too at how log the movie is (90 minutes) as it really is a good length family movie.  My 2 year old has been running around saying ""I'm a Pirate Fairy!"" They even incorporate Captain Hook, Mr. Smee and the crocodile into this one!",1395964800,3,764,3.9802631578947367
6134987,5,B00H5RYN5Y,I was look forward to this since I first saw the teaser for it. After the disappointment that Hook's crew didn't appear in Tinkerbell and the Lost Treasure movie this appearance of James Hooks pirates (before he became Captain) and the birth of the Tick Tock Crocodile certainly made up for it in this film as Tinkerbell and her friends deal with swapped powers against a renegade dust keeper fairy turn pirate captain and her crew hanging out about Neverland's Skull Rock.  This film makes me hopeful that either Peter Pan or the Neverland mermaids may show up in future releases of the Tinkerbell series.  I highly recommend this to anyone who either a fan of Captain Hook or Neverland in general.  Having read the book adapation of the movie before it came out allowed me to make a decent review of it before seeing it.,1395878400,,822,4.616438356164384
