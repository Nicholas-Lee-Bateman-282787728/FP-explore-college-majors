7892517,5,6305570205,"This dvd was enjoyable but could have been longer. I love their music. Their tender ballads are super beautiful, but absent on here. It's more of a comedy nature.",1482364800,,162,4.620689655172414
7892518,5,6305570205,Loved this group.,1437782400,,17,5.0
7892519,4,6305570205,"The ""REAL"" Dr. Hook on stage stoned, forgetting words, dropping
 microphones, and trying hard to keep their guitars in tune. The
 type of show that only we few true Dr. Hook fans can watch over and
 over again. Catch Ray's Triple yodel and Dennis's Cops and Robbers
 and even George Cummings gets to sing one. too bad it's only 45
 minutes.",1082160000,6,340,4.508196721311475
7892520,3,6305570205,"Old Hippies never die...they just flash back.  I mean, how much can you milk out of a band whose only redeemable song was ""On The Cover Of The Rolling Stone?"" (In all honesty, the ""lead guitar solo"" on that song is almost the greatest guitar solo of the 70's, surpassed ONLY by Ariel Bender's solo on Mott The Hoople's ""The Golden Age Of Rock And Roll."")  Where is a Musikladen Mott The Hoople concert DVD, eh?",1039910400,,410,4.381578947368421
7892521,4,6305570205,"This DVD is great!! You will like it if you're a fan of the original Dr. Hook. This is the wild and crazy Dr. Hook. The sound is not that great, but the DVD is still good!!
I really enjoyed it!!",1010361600,,194,3.7560975609756095
7892522,4,6305570205,I found this vidio to be a great retro trip. I had almost forgotten how good the music of this group is and how outrageous the band members are.  I wish there were more vidios available.  The color and sound reproduction  is also great. A good buy for the money.,950832000,8,262,4.2
7892523,5,6305570205,"I have just seen the fabulous tv-show from musicladen, Germany 1974. A Excellent Show by Dr. Hook and the medicine show. A must, a real oddball for all Dr.hook fans all over. The brilliant sceneshow of Dennis Locorriere is  a sight. It really answer all my expectation indeed. Truly i recommend it  for everybody",943056000,8,312,4.7592592592592595
