3511144,5,B001CE0DW8,"I absolutely love this DVD. It guides you through very simple, easy exercises that really work! I always thought that yoga was only effective if you were doing something ""hardcore."" But after doing this workout just a couple times a week, I've really felt a difference",1321401600,,268,4.8478260869565215
3511145,5,B001CE0DW8,"A friend of mine was kind enough to lend me her copy of Shilpa's Yoga a couple of weeks ago.  I was sceptical, because I've tried other yoga programs that made me feel somehow deficient for not being a pretzel.  To be honest, I've never enjoyed most physical exercise.  However, from my first run through Shilpa's Yoga, I was hooked. Indeed, as you can see, I just bought my own copy! With the exception of one pose (Chakrasana) I was able to complete each exercise, in good form, and as I did it, I could feel the muscles working.  Yet, at no time did it feel like ""work"" or something I ""had to do.""  By the end, I experienced (for only the second time in my life) an ""exercise high.""  I felt pleasant, rested yet energetic, and upbeat.  Believe me, at the time my friend lent me the DVD, I was feeling none of those things.

As I tried it on the following days last week, I began to see how well-thought-out the program was.  A muscle that is stretched in one asana is relaxed in the next.  Again, with the exception of Chakrasana (which I have to ""cheat on"" by using a chair) all of these poses should be in the reach of most relatively healthy people.
Plus, the workout has continued to give me a pleasant happy feeling every time I've done it.

Another plus for me is the lovely surroundings, and Shilpa's lovely, coiffed, lightly made up appearance.  She and I have very similar body types and it's helpful for me to see another large bosomed female execute asanas that have in the past given me problems due to the problems inherent in arm placement when one is ""blessed overmuch"" in that area.  By looking at her, I can see roughly how the asana should look when I do them. I've seen a number of catty and rather superficial reviews on other sites criticizing her for having the ""temerity"" to wear makeup and hairdo, and to wear a couple of pieces of discreet jewelry.  Yoga may equate to asceticism, doing without, and minimalism to some people, but the point of this DVD to me is its value in bringing an ancient, well-developed system of fitness that addresses the entire self - body, mind, and spirit - without adopting a militant anti-glamour stance.  Frankly, because it's so good a video AND because it is a pleasant aesthetic experience, I'm far more likely to stick with it than other videos where the instructor speaks in a surly voice.

This is an honest review, so I do have a couple of criticisms, one of them large.  First and the more troubling, Shilpa and the narrator do not spend enough time in each asana.  I prefer to hold each asana for 30-60 seconds if not longer, and I've constantly got to keep my remote control at hand.

Secondly, I think the inclusion of Chakrasana should have been presented with an inset showing a modification.  The rest of the asanas (except perhaps Camel pose) are quite accessible, but to those of us with cervical weakness and poor upper body strength find this impossible.

Finally, I would have enjoyed perhaps a 5 minute cooldown in Shavasana.

Anyway, I have already noticed greater tone in my legs, and my obliques and psoas muscles are beginning to show better tone.

Thank you, Shilpa!",1314403200,5,3151,4.508802816901408
3511146,5,B001CE0DW8,This DVD provides great instruction for beginners! The moves and explanations are very simple and give you reasons why you should do them (very motivating). I wish it were longer!,1275955200,2,179,5.0
3511147,5,B001CE0DW8,"This was one of the higher quality yoga videos.  The editing is awesome, the music the background, it truly is a joy to watch.  The exercises are not too challenging but they give one a sense of peace and relaxation from a hectic day.  The only downside would be that the instructor tells you to do the exercises 3 times if you are more advanced.  It would have been nice if there was an option to hold the postures longer, or to do them 3 times with Shilpa so that I could get a more challenging workout.",1275609600,4,505,4.175257731958763
3511148,4,B001CE0DW8,This video workout is very good. The images of Kerala are relaxing and beautiful. The soundtrack quality is excellent and the voiceover guiding the exercises is very well paced. Any beginner can happily follow this.,1264550400,4,215,5.171428571428572
3511149,5,B001CE0DW8,"This is my first real attempt at yoga, as I tried yoga years ago and found it too boring. Well, I have mild scoliosis and need a strength-training routine, but I hate to sweat and workout. I decided to do yoga one day and see what everyone has been raving about. (I like Pilates, but found the ability to tone and sculpt the rear limited). I looked on amazon and found this gem. I've heard of Shilpa before and decided to try it, as I trust an Indian to instruct me on yoga. This dvd is so calming, and the instruction is so thorough. Shilpa never speaks, yet I find her adorable all the same (how is that?). The narrator sounds like someone off the kids' show, ""Paddington Bear"", but it's charming after the second time rather than annoyingly stuffy. Best of all, working with this dvd every day (I do lying down, and stomach asanas one day, and the rest on the second), I've found this lifted and toned my rear like no other workout EVER! And I've done the step workouts, weights, you name it. It's so weird that it doesn't even seem like a workout when you're doing it. I like how the narrator also tells you how each asana benefits you holistically. The dvd gets right into the workout and there's not too much talking. Can't say enough great things about this workout. If there's anything I would not praise the dvd on, it's that it takes a bit more time to get to the menu options when you pop it in, but that's such a small price for such wonderful benefits. I feel like I'm treating myself everyday I workout now.",1256342400,14,1521,4.321678321678322

3511157,4,B001CE0DW8,"I really enjoy this dvd. I use it nightly before bedtime since it is so relaxing. It's calming and the scenery is beautiful. The narrator's voice is one of my favorite things about the dvd. I love when he says, ""..but never more than that,"" with his wonderful accent. He says the long names of the poses most eloquently. In addition to being one of the most beautiful people I've ever seen, Shilpa Shetty comes across as good natured and very likeable. I am a beginner, and I can do most of the poses she demonstrates, with the exception of chakrasana. I would have liked some instruction about modifying that pose until I can do it. It would also be nice to hold the poses longer at times. I have to be ready with the pause button in some places. I feel like my muscles are strengthening quite quickly. I'm very pleased with my purchase.",1359936000,,838,4.412903225806452
3511158,2,B001CE0DW8,"This Yoga program targeted on the modern young, especially Indians, is designed for just that. The artist is a Martial Arts practitioner and Indian actress. Her Hindi is very good, but her English is somewhat unintelligible. She is an animal right activist, according to the media.

The DVD has the option of Hindi or English audio. Even the bonus features have that option.

Even though this is `popular yoga', the director has not omitted the basic principles. He has taken special care to provide a short description of the eight limbs of Yoga. There are brief sections of Pranayama and Dhyana. No mention of a source (Patanjali, Hinduism etc) is given, but Brahma as a Hindu deity is mentioned once during the asanas. A quote from Bhagavad Gita is also there. The Sanskrit name of each asana is given as it is performed. The entire routine is kept very simple and easy, except for the chakrasana. The technique and benefits of each asana as it is done, is explained well in a calming and effective male voice.

The breath-taking, beautiful background of the Kerala waters, canoes, Kalarippayattu and the elephants may steal the show from the performer.

The huge drawback is that the planners are truly disrespectful to the modest science of Yoga. They have dressed the artist in ridiculously revealing and obscene Westernized clothes. The pants hit the border of irreverence. The top she is wearing accommodates exaggerated body parts. How does this wardrobe belong in Yoga from India? Whose idea was this? Everyone in the media has a responsibility to the young, and they have forgotten that here.

Yoga, the sacred science, must be kept authentic in every respect.",1344124800,7,1671,4.932384341637011
3511159,5,B001CE0DW8,This yoga workout has a calming effect on you. I have done different forms of yoga but I am in love with Shilpa's yoga. It is so easy to do that I do not feel I am doing anything but the results are amazing. My stomach is going in and I am getting my curves. If someone is starting yoga for the first time then go for this. Actually it is good even if for people who have done yoga before. Must have in your exercise collection. Being your day with yoga exercise and get refreshed.,1340928000,,481,4.020833333333333
3511160,5,B001CE0DW8,"I love this yoga video. I think it is probably the best ever beginner yoga video I've seen, and as advertised on the cover: it is safe for a 10 year old or a 60 year old! Nonetheless, in the spirit of giving a useful review I am going to state both pros and cons.

Cons: If you are American and used to lots of bells and whistles you may find this style kind of slow going.  This is NOT a flow yoga dvd.  She demonstrates each pose once (rather beautifully), pauses, and then moves on to the next.  The voice over suggests that as a beginner you do each pose once, and as you get proficient you might do each pose two or three times.  I completely agree with this advice.  Doing each pose once took me about 40 or 50 minutes, you can shorten the workout if you want by skipping the breath exercises.

If you are used to the idea that every yoga sequence MUST have an inversion, the closest thing to an inversion is the ""half plough pose"" and the standing forward fold, and wheel.  There's no down dog, no shoulder stand, head stand etc.  Once again, as a yoga instructor myself, I agree with this choice - as this is a safe beginners tape.  If you want to learn that stuff, you really ought to go to the gym and learn from a live teacher.

If you are used to doing yoga in a studio you may notice that there is no corpse pose/relaxation pose at the end of the workout. You can of course, add that in yourself if you want.

My only other complaint would be that in Warrior I, I notice Shilpa has her knee way out further than her ankle.  Even the voice over is directing you to NOT do this.  It is better to go no more than 90 degrees, as this is a lot of pressure to put on your knee.

The Pluses far far out weight the cons:  This is a nice sequence with clear direction.  Even the first time you do the DVD, you don't have to crane your neck to see the screen because you can listen to the very articulate instructions.  The instructions include tons of interesting aside information regarding the benefits of each pose.

The music is cool Bollywood sounding music.

They filmed in beautiful locations: by the river, on a boat, on the beach and in a bungalow.  Plus Shilpa is beautiful to look at.  The camera loves her, and she carefully displays each movement. When I watch American made yoga videos a lot of times the camera is on the yogi's face when you want to see what their body is doing.  In this video they successfully make each shot about showing you how to do the pose.

Like a lot of yoga, this ""workout"" doesn't feel like a workout.  Yet it WILL tone your body, stretch your muscles and increase your calm.  iF you are already in shape doing yoga is a nice complement to other sports.  If you are not in shape yoga is a great entry level sport because you don't have to worry about being really strong, or co-ordinated - just do what you can. If you can't do wheel pose at first, substitute bridge pose until you can.  You'll get there!
