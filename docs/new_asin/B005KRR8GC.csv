4718465,5,B005KRR8GC,"Even with George Lucas's film ""Red Tails"" there are still so many that don't know this very significant part of American History. This video reveals even more and should be shown in every classroom when studying American history. I recommend this video highly to any one interested in learning about true American heroism and bravery.",1368144000,8,334,5.090909090909091
4718466,5,B005KRR8GC,"One of the sad things about American history is that it has never been properly shared to all of the Americans all of the sacrifices and achievements made by the unwanted Black Americans, Navajo Indians, Japaneese and all other ethnic heroes. I was so glad to be able to see and hear some of the Tuskegee soldiers story. How America treated them and took so long to recognize them is unamerican. Thanks for all of those involved in getting their story out. Just think if the story would have been shared whenthe events happened,  how many lives could have been impacted and possibly spared knowing that the accompolishments of the Black Americans would have made them pleased to be in Americans and made even more significant contributions for other generations to come.",1356307200,4,770,4.833333333333333
4718467,5,B005KRR8GC,"There is an excellent historical lesson here.  Success in the face of so many odds.  An uphill climb all the way.  So many unique individuals involved, and the different ways each dealt with their obstacles.  I loved this book.",1356048000,2,227,4.743589743589744
4718468,5,B005KRR8GC,"I wanted to see this movie before I purchased ""RED TAILS.""  I saw ""The Tuskegee Airmen"" twice in the theatre and I own the DVD and it was an excellent movie.  In seeing that movie it taught me something I didn't know and felt that every American & Canadian citizen should know about. In my opinion their story must never die.

This Documentary tells the story of these famous & brave Black American flyers/Pilots who flew mission after mission protecting the men who were flying the bombers. You will hear their stories told by them. Having the opportunity to see and hear these men talk about what they did during WWII all the while being ridiculed and mocked you could say was an eye opener for me.  In the end, they persevered and proved their mettle through it all and you could say, that they let their record tell the story of how good they actually were.

I would recommend this to anyone who either knows their story or to those who don't, because you will know so much more after you see this documentary about The Tuskegee Airmen.",1349395200,9,1040,4.481481481481482

4718470,4,B005KRR8GC,"The men who flew these planes did a magnificant job in WWII.  Little seems to be known about them but they did their jobs with fantastic results - they never lost a plane they were assigned to escort!  They did lose pilots, about 60 of them, and had a difficult road.  They excelled in spite of the hardships.  Shows what CAN be done if the heart is strong and the desire is there.",1343520000,6,381,4.178082191780822
4718471,4,B005KRR8GC,"I am pleased that ""The Airmen"" are being recognized.  Former First Lady E Roosevelt knew what she doing when she helped them during WWII.
I enjoyed the DVD very much.",1342310400,3,166,4.533333333333333
4718472,5,B005KRR8GC,"My dad was one of these valiant pilots. He was a B-25 bomber pilot with a crew of 5 in the 477th Bomber Group which went through unbelieveable injustice when they were stationed on Freeman Field in Seymour, IN.
Their actions resulting from the treatment they received from the white commanding officers in charge of this field, along with the heroism of the 332nd Fighter Group, the ""Red Tails"", was just as instrumental in President Truman desegregating the WHOLE Armed Forces. This incident is not public knowledge for the most part. This is the first time I have seen it recognized with the scope it deserves on DVD or in print other than ""The Tuskegee Airmen Mutiny at Freeman Field"" by Lt. Col. James Warren.
I had the opportunity to visit Freeman Field in 1996 during the National Convention. What I learned there had me in tears. BRAVO to this documentary and Bryton Entertainment for including this major part of not just black history but history itself!!!",1332720000,31,965,4.7844311377245505
4718473,5,B005KRR8GC,"""In Their Own Words The Tuskegee Airmen"" is true to its name and product description.  It is a documentary about the Tuskegee Airmen, but I feel it stand outs because there are a number of personal stories from the men throughout, and they are told as the name suggests, ""in their own words.""  You see the range of emotions in the stories, and feel a connection with the men telling them.

One of many examples is the story of Spann Watson seeing the ""Spirit of St Louis"" in 1927 at an air show.  He recognized the plane in the air before the show announcer did.  The announcer mocked him over the loudspeaker saying ""this little colored boy thinks that's the Spirit of St Louis.""  This event was Spann's drive to pursue a career in aviation.  I read the story in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Knights-The-Story-of-the-Tuskegee-Airmen/dp/1565548280/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Knights: The Story of the Tuskegee Airmen</a>&nbsp;and it was compelling, but to actually see Mr. Watson tell the story through tear-filled eyes was almost overwhelming.

And with the different personalities of the men, there are humorous stories throughout.  One is of Leo Gray recalling his first encounter with flak.  He was so enamored with it, that he was left by the formation.  He tells that he throttled up to catch the group, and was mistaken for a ""bogey, at six o'clock,"" to which two fighters turned to intercept him.  He chuckles through the story, and jokes ""there was a burst of flak from an outhouse in Switzerland that nearly got him killed.""

Overall, I really enjoyed ""In Their Own Words: The Tuskegee Airmen"" and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to learn about the Tuskegee Airmen.",1327795200,36,1745,5.189285714285714

4718499,5,B005KRR8GC,"This film gives true insight into the experience of the Tuskegee Airmen--their triumphs and their battles to receive what was due to them. The first-hand stories they tell reveal a pride in a country they loved but did not always love them in return. The film gives long overdue recognition to brave men who protected the bomber streams during WWII, and many a B-17 or B-24 pilot was thrilled to see the sight of the Red Tails flying escort.",1440460800,,441,4.594936708860759

Since he's black and I'm not, I wanted to give him something of great value before he departs in a couple months. Something that reaches down deep and may motivate him even more than he already is. My wife & I watched it first, and concluded that we should have a copy of this incredible documentary for our own library! Should be viewed by all in American schools.",1429488000,2,525,4.595744680851064

4718533,5,B005KRR8GC,"An excellent companion to the 1995 movie starring Lawrence Fishburne. No frills, special effects, or re-enactments - just a straight-up documentary. As an ex-GI, I felt a connection to the guys being interviewed - no bragging, whining, or political commentary. Just regular guys, doing their jobs under extraordinary circumstances. Extraordinary, even for wartime.

I'm glad I got the opportunity to hear what these guys had to say ""In Their Own Words"". There are very few of the original group left, and it won't be long before they're all gone. This flick corrects some of the Hollywood license employed in the dramatic film, yet only strengthens the impression that this group went well above and beyond. Real history, as told by the eyewitnesses.

""When the legend becomes fact, print the legend."" And so it goes in the entertainment biz. But before the studio folks crank out another Tuskegee re-make, I think they should pay closer attention to the real soldiers involved, and less on the legend. It's an inspiring story, even without the hype. OK, I'll allow some latitude with the Me-262 dogfights - awesome!

Although this film focuses on African Americans, it should also serve as a reminder of the sacrifice made by White, Asian, German, and Native American troops as well. When Americans all pull together, we're one bad force to be reckoned with.",1410998400,,1359,5.0311111111111115
