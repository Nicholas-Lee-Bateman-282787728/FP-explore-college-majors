But if you are unsure of how to do this, or if your parish would like to educate its educators on how to conduct little Praying in Color workshops, The Teaching DVD would also be a valuable resource.

In the DVD you will meet Sybil Macbeth as she conducts a Praying in Color workshop for some children.  Macbeth travels around the country conducting these workshops, so she is a great person to teach you how to share this fun method of prayer with your own students.  And youll get to watch the entire workshop to equip you with lots of great ideas!",1470441600,,710,4.396946564885496

8350642,4,B0024IXOUY,"I stumbled upon the original ""Praying in Color"" book for adults a couple of years ago and fell in love with it.  It is a wonderful prayer technique for me and for many others I've taught it to.  I shared it in a very basic way with a confirmation class at our church and the kids not only loved it, I had great feedback from the parents - they marveled at their kids' willingness to sit down quietly in their rooms and doodle their way to prayer.

When the kids' version of the book came out I ordered it eagerly and found it as useful and interesting as the adults' book.  Now this DVD offers a great snapshot of an actual kids' class being taught this technique by the original author.  It includes some excellent tips for helping the kids warm up to each other and to the idea of prayer and then shows how the author leads a group of children through learning to pray for others through this technique.

As another reviewer mentioned, this is not a DVD for children, but rather an instructional DVD for those wanting to teach children how to do this.  It would definitely help to have read one or both of the books and to have tried the technique on your own.

The closing segment of the video has very brief comments on how to use this technique for other forms of prayer besides prayer for the needs of others (what is technically known as ""intercessory prayer""), such as prayers of adoration or praise, prayers of thanksgiving, prayers of confession, and prayers of petition, or praying for yourself.  This was very short and I would have enjoyed seeing some actual clips of kids being taught these techniques, but that is really my only criticism of the video.

I recommend it highly for anyone seeking to prepare to teach children this highly accessible, easy to learn form of prayer.",1275523200,17,1792,4.486153846153846
8350643,5,B0024IXOUY,"Praying the Body is a fantastic DVD I loved it! I have plenty of DVDs like it but not one can hold a candle to it.  I have to admit the DVD is expensive but since I have the book I knew I would not be disappointed.  This DVD is worth every cent.  The body prayers, the scenery,the bible readings are all thought provoking.  I love the Alleluia prayer sessions work great for me for morning body prayers,and they are only 18 mins. long so it can be a great AM pick me up if one does not have time for morning devotions until later.  The body prayers are all very very easy yet you will get a great feeling of not only opening up your self to God but humbling yourself before him like a child and praising and thanking the Lord for your very breath. I am a devout Christian yet, I feel this DVD is suitable not only Christians and lovers of the psalms (which is the main focus), but for all those who hunger for spritual peace in a rushed world.  The DVD is 71 mins. long.  I did all the sessions the first time and later on I felt like doing one session at a time since I practice devotional prayer and bible reading through the hours anyway.  So this DVD was right up my alley.  As I've said before You won't be disapointed take it from me, the one time biggest skeptic that ever walked the earth.
