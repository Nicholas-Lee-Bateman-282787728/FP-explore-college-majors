7028783,3,B00U35Y9NG,A decent movie that is just okay. Internet porn takes a hold of a college professor and nearly ruins his life. The professor becomes obsessed with one of his students he met online and she blackmails him for money.,1432339200,6,214,4.512820512820513

7028787,2,B00U35Y9NG,"Professor Bill Pollard (David Christian Welborn) teaches Biology 101 at Thatherton Community College. He is obsessed with an on-line cutie Dani Darling (Noelle DuBois, topless again) to the point he would rather fly solo with her than to fulfill his weekly Thursday night duty with his wife (Deborah O'Brien) a sound sleeper who doesn't realize Bill is gone all night until late in the film.

Then, in an unlikely scenario, ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine."" Yes Dani, now Marissa Weaver enrolls in Pollard's class, a man she doesn't like as much in real life as the faceless perv who tips her gifts.

This had a made for TV feel to it with a plot that might appeal to the understanding wife type that appears in the film. Bill is the only person on the planet who hasn't mastered thinking of one person while making love to another. The production went into inane directions in a badly written script. I really liked Noelle DuBois in ""Night Vision"" where I thought she was really sexy. What really surprised me was that the gifts you tip the girls on-line they actually get. I would have assumed they would get the cash in a split with their sponsor.",1428796800,,1196,4.532407407407407

7028789,2,B00U35Y9NG,"OK, it's a laughably bad b-movie - as in, you'll be laughing in places I don't think the filmmakers intended - but it's not... completely terrible. This is one of those movies that you realize, about halfway through, that actually had potential to be a really interesting film. While I knew I was watching a silly made-for-cable movie, I admit I wanted to get to the end to see how it turned out, in spite of the acting and some laughably bad scenes (like the one in which ""Bill"" smacks the mail out of his wife's hands and she reacts like nothing just happened and kinda just... doesn't react, as if nothing happened, or the dozen scenes where you're saying to yourself ""that made absolutely no sense""). But, I got to the end, and indeed it just kept getting worse, capped off with a truly lame ending.

Bottom line: It's just a bad b-movie: poorly directed and boringly acted. But, I have to say the story, if it produced and directed in the hands of a different, more experienced filmmaking team with a decent budget, could really have been something interesting. I think this actually had the makings of a pretty decent dark comedy, or, on the other side of the coin, even a more serious thriller.

I'd usually not take the time to review a film this bad, but I have to give credit where it is due, and I wanted to point out the potential of this story. Definitely do not rent this - you'll absolutely regret it, even if it looks tempting. Wait for this one on Netflix or Amazon Prime.",1426896000,22,1489,4.430656934306569
7028790,5,B00U35Y9NG,"I saw this film screened in a tiny theatre in Phoenix and knew it was destined to be discovered and enjoyed by everyone who sees it. The story is intriguing without being overly complex, easy to follow and the acting is superb. It's the cinematography that is really the centerpiece of this film. Each shot is masterfully textured and designed to keep you in the moment. I wish every indie film looked this good. A very entertaining film and one that remains constantly within reach in my DVD collection. So glad I finally got my hands on this film and now everyone can enjoy it.",1425427200,4,579,4.523809523809524

Runner up is everyone else in this movie..wait..the daughter could actually act a little.
This wasn't such a horrible script probably.
Throw some lamo like Nic Cage in this and direct it with a bunch of drama and
a bigger budget and you probably got it in the box office.
As it is..it's terrible. But I watched it cuz of the premise.
Really, half the movie is a close-up of Bill's face...not too pretty; he looks
like he took a few benadryl before each scene.

The acting was average (could have been worse), the cinematography while mostly conservative, explored some unique shots here and there, but the thing that ultimately gave this movie two stars and two stars only was the writing. Nothing was original, everything that was said was expected, and the best scenes in the film were often the ones that contained the least amount of dialogue.
