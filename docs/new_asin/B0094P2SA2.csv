The harmony's are to die for and you get songs like 'Black cow' and 'Aja'.Of course I have a 200 dollar pair of head phones so the quality is turned into a good thing, add a few beers and no complaints here. I seen them at the Coors Amphitheater in Chula Vista California in 2003 promoting the CD 'Everything must go'so this is definitely a reminder of that summer night. Someone throws in corny special effects in the DVD but who the heck cares if you are a fan of the Dan or part of the Clan. I can see Steely Dan anytime I please. I usually choose this one out of the 3 I have.  I would like to hear from some of the people that went to this concert that actually see themselves here. Are you dead or what?  This concert is from Pine Knob Amphitheater Clarksten ,MI, USA on August 11th 2003.' Everything must go tour'... Donald actually sings from 'HEY NINETEEN'' WAY BACK WHEN THAT'S OTIS REDDING'....THEY LIKE TO CHANGE IT UP.Sure I wish Donald and Walter could of arranged for more high quality recordings for future Concert DVD'S etc. but this is all we have now. So for me, I am happy with this collection. Here is your line up of songs in exact order.>

19. DON'T TAKE ME ALIVE
20. MY OLD SCHOOL
21. FM (NO STATIC AT ALL)
22. JAZZ INSTRUMENTAL AS DONALD AND WALTER LEAVE THE STAGE.

Haitian divorce is sung by Walter and sounds really good but it is missing the vibes in the background. You know that relaxing soothing sound of the vibes. The steely damned played it just like the song on the album minus Donalds voice. Still good though.

Get your copy before it goes out of print like the 'Two against nature' live concert did. Now you have to pay big bucks for that one.",1399075200,8,2258,4.291079812206573
5262561,4,B0094P2SA2,"I bought this DVD from Amazon U.K. after reading mostly favourable reviews and thought that this site should at least have one review for the curious Dan fan. Given that the only official DVD from this great band is the `Two Against Nature' live, those who have seen them live in the past decade would love something to watch at home so that's where this one comes in. It was filmed on the `Everything Must Go' tour in 2003.

It is obviously an unofficial release and the video quality is very average and the bigger the screen the worse it gets. There is some weird stuff like the company logo being permanently displayed in the top right corner and the camera person sometimes focuses on the backdrop for overly long. At least when a solo is happening it does focus on the correct musician. The upside is that the performance is first rate and the audio quality though only in stereo is quite okay. The balance is good and the bass adequate. It does require a bit of EQ tweaking to get it just right.

8536011,5,B0094P2SA2,"Excellent concert, but, the video quality was lacking (they also could have turned up the mic a bit).  Definitely worth owning if you are a Steely Dan fan",1458864000,,154,4.5
8536012,1,B0094P2SA2,"This appears to be bootleg quality. Here is what you get: 3 people likely filmed this concert from their seats.  The film quality is poor and the sound quality is horrible.  It's unfortunate that Steely Dan didn't produce this concert because all the fan favorite songs were played.  If you are interested in a great Steely Dan DVD, don't waste your money on this DVD.  Instead, purchase ""Live at Lincoln Center: The Dukes of September""  featuring Donald Fagen, Michael McDonald and Boz Scaggs fan favorites in a well produced concert DVD.",1453593600,,539,4.8791208791208796

8536015,4,B0094P2SA2,This video appearance of SD is AWESOME! I'm no expert but I think it's the pro vid they shot at the show to be broadcast on the large screens for those who were further out from the stage. It's crazy good folks. A must have!!!! The Steely Dan Show song is hilarious!!!,1431648000,2,268,4.173076923076923
8536016,3,B0094P2SA2,Decent concert but the sound quality was lacking - even on my Bose surround sound system.  I am glad I made the purchase but was hoping for greater audio performance.,1427932800,,166,4.533333333333333
8536017,3,B0094P2SA2,Video/Audio quality not great but I just love Steely Dan!,1421107200,,57,4.8
8536018,4,B0094P2SA2,"I've seen Steely Dan four times now...most recently in Birmingham last month.  My first experience was in Atlanta in 2003 for the Everything Must Go tour (the one captured on this DVD).  The quality isn't bootleg, but it isn't great.  The sound is fair...a little better than being there, but most importantly, it is *not* in stereo as listed on the back cover, nor is it likely in any form of Dolby.  The lack of a copyright date leads me to believe it's a boot.  With those expectations in mind, it is a great way to remember what the show was like (it wasn't in stereo either), and, for that, I'll give it four stars.  For the nerds, it includes Ted Baker, Cornelius Bumpus, Jon Herington, Michael Leonhart, Jim Pugh, and is the first tour for the monster Keith Carlock.",1409443200,4,773,4.485714285714286
