8132727,5,B000GI3KU8,"Oh my, this is so shocking, and I remember being taught this in school.  The rise and fall of Germany expertly shown via real old videos. Most must be extremely rare.  Excellent and moving for youths today to see and learn, that history is still repeating in the 21st century.  How creative Hitler was to convince millions of people to believe in this great orator.",1459296000,,365,4.584615384615384

8132730,3,B000GI3KU8,"It's an old documentary by a Swedish company. It's accurate, but there is nothing new to be learned watching the film.. The film clips are also standard stuff. Delivery was timely and the DVD is in fine condition.",1379462400,2,213,4.631578947368421

(See link for which version I'm commenting on.)

Tells Hitler's story from youth, how early-on he defined a racist philosophy from ideas gleaned through a radical periodical. Covers Germany in WWI, the Kaiser's abdication in favor of the first Republic, Hitler's and the Nazis' steady ascendency from a failed 1923 putsch, his appointment as Chancellor despite being a minority candidate, then complete control gained upon the death of Pres. von Hindenburg.

The war years focuses on atrocities committed in Poland. A particular highlight of this documentary are the many minutes of German-made film not usually seen in English or American studies of this type. A brilliant work, my highest recommendation.",1270857600,5,873,6.517241379310345
8132732,1,B000GI3KU8,This is one of the worst WW2 documentaries Ive seen. It is dated and the video quality is very poor.,1232841600,4,100,4.05
8132733,3,B000GI3KU8,"The footage is great, and for that reason I have to give it three stars. What we really have here is a series of documentaries that were sewn together forty years ago in the hopes of fabricating a coherent whole. Well, it isn't very coherent as we move through the 12 year nightmare sequence again and again. We see Hitler and the Reich die and get resurrected continuously, but some of the photography was unknown to me and may not have been seen elsewhere by other students of history. Mein Kampf's uniqueness and its rare archive material make it valuable. Something that heightens our knowledge base allows us to tolerate the terrible sound quality and its choppy, irregular narrative flow.",1168732800,2,694,4.791666666666667
