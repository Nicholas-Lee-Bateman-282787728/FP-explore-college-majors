7865349,3,6304203845,"Sometimes confusing story line, but enjoyable watching. Peter Masterson ( director ) handles it very much like the stage play he also directed. Mary Stuart Masterson gives a strong performance as a very shallow individual,  but her devotees will love her no matter how upsetting her character may  be.  Other good acting helps, but once again, the storyline can be  difficult to comprehend.  Watch it several times to appreciate it more.",933120000,5,437,5.098591549295775
