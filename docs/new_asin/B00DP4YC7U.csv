5839851,4,B00DP4YC7U,"I just became a fan of the show and seen this for a really good price. The DVD is lacking some extra features, but that's the usual downfall of most Season One's. Like most season one's it's short, but it is a web series, and the episodes are pretty short anyway. If you are a fan, or looking to something cheap and extra to your anime shopping cart, this is a buy.

Oh, and the extras are pretty nice too!",1385251200,,406,4.075
5839852,5,B00DP4YC7U,"Worth purchasing the DVD not only are you supporting the production of original content the fact is the story is creative and the use of poser to make the anime is great. Think about this how many great animes that are made japan and made for young adults and teens compared to USA where everything is geared towards little kids. This anime is great for kids as well but when you watch it you feel as if your watching something that is not made in the USA meaning its an anime in the sense thats not from japan and homegrown in the usa. Also if you like the free web episodes buying the dvd makes sense your supporting the production of a good anime. How many people can say that, not only supporting the production of anime in terms of purchasing the dvd, your as well showing the company there is a fan base and hopefully this support will spur the development of more anime content from this company and smaller companies as well who feel they cant compete against the bigger companies, Big companies have dominated animation in USA its about time that smaller companies see that the web is another great medium to showcase anime beyond just tv stations, I am so happy this anime was made, or web anime series.",1384473600,,1213,4.443946188340807
5839853,2,B00DP4YC7U,"I purchased this solely to be able to watch it with subtitles/closed caption as it says it has them on the DVD cover...I pop it into the DVD player, no caption comes on whatsoever. I try two different computers, same result...basically, as a hard of hearing fan, I am unable to enjoy this because I can't understand what they are saying.

If the DVD doesn't have caption, please don't say it does....it's false advertisement and disappointment for those who are deaf and hard of hearing and want to watch it.",1384300800,5,508,4.644444444444445
5839854,3,B00DP4YC7U,"Show is great. A wonderful creation by Monty Oum and the rest at RoosterTeeth.

5839879,4,B00DP4YC7U,This is a great show and if you are reading this review you can decide for yourself you can watch episodes of RWBY for free at Roosterteeth's website or their YouTube page. If you you like I suggest coming back here and buying the DVD or Bluray to help support this show. Personally I think this show is worth the few bucks the physical media costs.,1488844800,,349,4.303030303030303
5839880,5,B00DP4YC7U,"Rwby season 1 may lack graphics, backround wise but the show and plot is what it really comes down to! If you don't like anime that's ok! Its american anime so its for all.

5839881,5,B00DP4YC7U,"have seen other volume 2 of RWBY  I think it is safe to say the volume one is the part of it. its fast pace. light heart and very humorious I love how the characters are first introduced,  and the first mission that put them in the teams that they are in. the dust stealers are real entertaining and love how they work how wrong bigotry is without getting too preachy about it.

5839903,5,B00DP4YC7U,"Ruby Rose has always wanted to become a heroic Huntress, and when she gets invited to Beacon Academy, she gets her chance. Teamed up with her sister, Yang Xiao Long, and Weiss Schnee and Blake Belladonna, they form Team RWBY (pronounced Ruby). They have a lot to learn about being Huntresses, and even more about each other. It will be very challenging...and a lot of fun!

This CGI show was released on YouTube by Rooster Teeth Productions, and became a viral smash-hit! The animation work is very good, though not up to Pixar standards. However, the story is so well written and exciting that you really don't notice that. Indeed, the accompanying music is also excellent and really helps give the production a great feel.

Yeah, I have to say this is a fun and entertaining show, one that is sure to please everyone young and old!",1466467200,,833,4.659863945578231
5839904,5,B00DP4YC7U,"I'm not sure how many people complained about the visuals, but applause to the company and artists for being different.  I watched this on Netflix but the quality of the DvD is much better, so it's worth the purchase.

Not just the art, but the concepts are really, really nice.  Each character has his/her own abilities, weapons, personality and not everything is given out the first time, you learn something new about each character a bit at a time.  The story itself keeps progressing well, lots of action and moments when not everything is so serious; the dialogue and character interactions are just funny, you could tell the team had a good time putting this together, humor that successfully makes it from one continent to the other intact and convincing is very hard to find.  If I could compare this series to another, it would be 'Transformers Prime,' which had an ongoing, complex plot, lots of character interaction and funny.

This should be part of your collection, great addition.",1465689600,,996,4.863905325443787
5839905,5,B00DP4YC7U,"I originally watched RWBY by accident on Netflix. I couldn't sleep and I figured this colorful movie (which is what I thought it was at the time) would either have good / colorful action or put me to sleep. Well the latter didn't happen. I ended up watching the whole series, because the story, characters, and humor were that engrossing. Also appreciated the non-copy/paste female heroines. Rooster Teeth definitely nailed it on this.

5839942,5,B00DP4YC7U,RWBY is an anime style show that started out as a mini series on YouTube. The graphics (cell shaded and cartoony) tend to put people off but if you don't mind that the story line is very good and the action scenes are amazing to watch.

and not one single show like this!

We've seen all of these characters before: the stuck-up rich girl, the loner with a dark secret and an even darker past, the party girl who is more serious than she pretends, and the nave too-young idealist who becomes their leader not because she's the best, far from it, but because she alone never forgets why they do what they do,...

and we've never seen them portrayed like this!

We've heard great anime soundtracks and scores before,...

and we've never heard such a perfect pairing of both from the father-daughter team of Jeff Williams and Casey Lee Williams.

The animation is cheap and limited and absolutely extraordinary, especially during the amazing fight scenes, like nothing you've ever seen,...

and it only gets better as the show continues!

A good example of how unique the approach is are the four trailers included on this disc, the ones done to introduce the upcoming series in general and four main characters specifically.  Most of the time trailers are made up of clips from the movie or show, scenes you will watch again in the finished product.  In this case we get four never seen again prequels that are still being referred back to in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/RWBY-Volume-2/dp/B00NLZA8E4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">RWBY: Volume 2</a>.

How unique is this completely derivative show?  It is in the process of becoming the first American anime officially released in Japan with a Japanese dubbing.  My references to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tetsuwan-Atom/dp/B00EI6R9YC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tetsuwan Atom</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tetsujin-28-Go/dp/B0052BY5BW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tetsujin 28-Go</a>&nbsp;were more apt than I imagined!

5839960,5,B00DP4YC7U,"I quickly came to love & care about these characters. There is an abundance of terrific humor contained in an extremely fun, if somewhat familiar story. While the video game quality CGI animation ""engine"" itself may be off-puttingly bare bones to some, considering the relatively ""shoe-string"" CGI budget, the visuals are quite well done & greatly enhanced by the fine work done by the animators & concept artists. I greatly enjoyed the dialog and have to disagree greatly with those who find it to be sub-par. Not only were some scenes laugh-out-loud funny, I don't remember having any real moments where I rolled my eyes at what was being said. I'd watch season after season of this!

-----
First off, I was not familiar with RoosterTeeth. So I went into this blind.
The art style, writing, animation and voice acting work together to bring an amazing series.
The writing is so well done. The story never feels to be too slow or fast pases. I watched it in a span of 1h50m, but it felt like longer (which is a good thing). The story drops a few bits of exposition in the beginning, but you mostly learn as the series goes on; which is something I'm fond of.
The humor never gets stale. All throughout the action-packed fighting and seriousness, there are hilarious jokes and gags that never feel forced.
The fighting bits are well animated and intense.
-----
Next, although the animation isn't the best, it's still amazing and the art style is just georgeous. The only thing that is a downside for me is the animation. Aside from the fighting (which has amazing animation), there are subtle little quarks that appear very often. such as; lip-synching, jittering, stiff movements, objects moving through one another. But these are subtle, for the most part. But after your first viewing, they won't even bother you anymore. Sadly, the animation is what keeps this from getting 5 stars.
The voice acting is exceptional. Most of the actors (to my knowledge) are new to VA work, so you can tell they are trying and it shows.
-----
Lastly, as for the actual characters, they all have their own personality. Each character plays off every other character in creative ways. Each character feels like their own person.
Favourite part: Yang and Blake's first interaction
-----
Now, is this series perfect, no.
But it is gorgeous, very creative, and just a lot of fun. This movie clearly deserves its 4-star rating

I will post a DVD review after I receive it :)",1414972800,,1975,4.62962962962963

5840000,1,B00DP4YC7U,"I'm actually shocked that the people behind this ""series"" have the audacity to sell it for actual money. RWBY is subpar is almost every way.

Plot and character development are nearly non-existentthough I guess that's to be expected when half the episodes are only five minutes long. Seriously, how can you ask $20+ for a 16-episode series when your longest episode doesn't even hit the 15-minute mark?

The animators very clearly put most of their efforts into the admittedly good-looking action sequences. Everything else, however, is storyboard quality at best. A few snazzy fight scenes don't excuse constant clipping, lazy backgrounds, etc.

The writing and the voice acting...I'm not even going to attempt to describe how painful they can get. I've watched dubbed anime, and I know not to expect too much from these sorts of things, but I also wasn't expecting RWBY to be so consistently dreadful. It doesn't even have the excuse of having been poorly translated. It's just straight-up cringe-worthy.

On a positive note: the music is pretty solid.",1404691200,6,1054,5.1104651162790695
5840001,4,B00DP4YC7U,"I originally watched RWBY during its initial release online and decided to support the company by buying the DVD, too.  I love all the research about the fairy tale lore of the characters of RWBY/  Monty Oum and Rooster Teeth have brought a great re-imagining of the fairy tales.  Each character grows in his or her own way as the story develops.  I ended up liking some characters and hating others, however that is not meant as a strike against the writers.  All the characters grow and react greatly to one another.  I love the weapons and the battle scenes as they are detailed and mind boogling.

The only negative review I have to give is that the beginning is a bit slow and some of the writing there is a bit cheesy.  This does eventually erode away with future episodes.",1404604800,,779,4.475177304964539
5840002,5,B00DP4YC7U,I love being able to see it without credits rolling every 5mins.  This show is awesome!  I can't wait for season 2,1404604800,,114,4.136363636363637

5840004,5,B00DP4YC7U,"I enjoy every minute of RWBY, from its bonus features to its commentaries and its hidden Easter eggs it was worth every dollar. Fortunately I was able to find it at Wal-Mart for the same price. So for the next volume and onward, I'll buy it there.",1400371200,,247,4.276595744680851
5840005,5,B00DP4YC7U,absolutely love rwby and can't wait for more. from the character and weapon design to the sense of humor and story creates such an amazing world and mythos. and the soundtrack is the cherry on top!,1399248000,,197,4.5
5840006,5,B00DP4YC7U,"If you have not seen the series then I encourage you to watch it hosted on the creators' website or youtube channel first. The series builds a charming world and proceeds to layer common tropes and turn them sideways. The show is anchored on tributes and references to fairy tales and fables and has a Harry Potter or X-Men first class vibe centering on a college for heroes in training.

If you are a fan of the series, the ""watch as a movie"" selection is worth the dvd purchase price. Commentary and extras are pretty good too..",1398556800,2,530,4.463917525773196

5840035,4,B00DP4YC7U,I've been a fan of the company for a long time and I think they have the potential to make another big hit alongside RvB. I'm into too many anime but I have to say I liked this one. The writing isn't to my particular taste. I'm 22 and the writing of the show skews towards more of a teenage audience. The mo cap and choreography is fantastic! Monty and the guys really know how to make big action scenes without them being too long or overdone. They've also created such a big universe and I can't wait to see where they take to story and characters next.,1393459200,,555,4.148148148148148

5840037,5,B00DP4YC7U,"As a fan of anime and RvB, when I first heard about this coming from Rooster Teeth, the creators of RvB, I watched the first trailer and it looked intriguing to me. I watched the trailers as they were released, until the first episode came out. And was not disappointed.

The show has some really good animation(It was done using Poser of all things. Color me surprised when I learned that).

The story is really well done. The characters are really well done.

The one issue I have is that, the character's faces are too white, almost to the point where they get washed out. I have a suspicion that it has something to do with the lighting in some areas, because in the scene where everyone is getting ready for bed at the end of episode 2, you can see the skin tones, and you can clearly see their faces. To be fair, this is their first season, so obviously, hopefully, next season will improve on that.

The episodes were short, but hey, it's Rooster Teeth, some of their stuff, like RvB and RTAA are going to be short, so it's no big deal.

I was not disappointed with this show. It was awesome, and I'm looking forward to the next season.",1392681600,,1143,4.347417840375587

5840075,5,B00DP4YC7U,"Let me start off by saying I'm a huge Rooster Teeth fan, and have been for about a year now. I will admit that the animation does need some work, but it's not so bad that it takes away from the show and its characters. There is much room to improve, just look a Red Vs Blue from season 1 to season 11. RWBY has interesting characters and an enthralling story-line, whether you watch anime or not. Which I don't, by the way. I watch this all the time, though. Can't wait for Volume 2!",1389052800,,483,4.094736842105263

5840092,5,B00DP4YC7U,Over all Monty Oum has created another masterful piece along with the rest of the staff from Rooster Teeth. The characters are interesting with all of their quircks and the story is interesting. It will be interesting to see where the story continues to go within the next season.,1387411200,,280,4.73469387755102
5840093,4,B00DP4YC7U,"I wanted to love this series, but I can only like it. It has too many little problems.

Bad things first: Some of the minor object interactions are flawed (like Roman smashing his cigar, Ruby eating the cookies), there are way too many tropes, some characters act stupidly or predictably and a few of the episodes were too short to really make any progress.

Good things: Monty's action scenes are fantastic as always, the character designs are creative and well-varied, the voice acting is on par with RVB (a bit weird, but really satisfying), some of the characters who do stupid things (like Weiss starting to get along with Ruby, then being really resistant to her style of leadership (despite the fact that she knows that Ruby is only a kid)) quickly stop doing said annoying thing, the world is interesting so far, several stories are being balanced at once, and you can still relate to most of the characters, even if they can be frustrating sometimes.

So, it's still good, but it might be a while before it reaches the heights of Red vs. Blue.",1387238400,,1052,4.645161290322581
5840094,5,B00DP4YC7U,"Personally i have to say this is my favorite anime period. It has great voice acting, excellent animation and plenty of character devolopment with the occasional awesome fight scene mixed in. Honestly my favorite part about the whole thing (besides the fighting) is watching the protagonists come together and improve over the course of the first volume. Each one of them has some flaw and those flaws help the audience connect with the characters and get invested in the series as well as actually feel for them when something goes wrong or there's angument between 2 or more of them. Can't wait for the next volume and fully expect it to at least match, if not top the first volume and solve a few mysteries (if you have seen this series you know what i mean).",1387152000,,762,4.610294117647059

5840096,5,B00DP4YC7U,"Rooster teeth takes a risk with a series outside its usual demographic and succeeds. RWBY, note spelling, is an intriguing series that I highly anticipate more volumes of.
