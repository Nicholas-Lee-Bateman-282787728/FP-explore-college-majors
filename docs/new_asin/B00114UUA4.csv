3059966,4,B00114UUA4,"Fingerprints (Harry Basil, 2006)

You've heard of the After Dark Horrorfest, right? Eight movies supposedly ""too scary to be released in theaters"" every year that are actually one step above (or, in some painful cases, one step below) Sci-Fi Channel Original Movies? Well, every once in a while I run across a movie that would have been absolutely perfect for After Dark that they somehow missed, probably because it's too well-made to actually bear the title-- it would make all the really mediocre movies look even more mediocre than they actually are. Fingerprints struck me this way; it's not all that good a movie, being both entirely unscary and entirely predictable, and thus it's perfect After Dark fodder, but it's well-made and well-acted enough that it would stand out in a typical After Dark lineup like a glowing beacon of sanity.

Melanie (Pixel Perfect's Leah Pipes, all grown up) gets out of rehab and heads back home-- except ""home"" is now somewhere different, as her family moved to a new town while she was locked up. Her bubbly sister Crystal (Kristin Cavallari of the upcoming Green Flash in her first big-screen appearance) tries to help Melanie fit into the new digs as much as possible, but word got out, and the kids in her new high school already think of her as a freak. It doesn't help that it seems she sees ghosts. The town's local urban legend involves leaving one's car in neutral on a set of railroad tracks, which will encourage the ghosts of a number of children who died in a horrible bus/train collision in the fifties to push your car off the tracks, leaving fingerprints on your bumper if you've coated it in baby powder (thus the movie's name). Everyone knows it's just an urban legend (in the movie, anyway-- I've seen at least two claims that this is based on a true story, both of them, of course, in different towns), but Melanie befriends a shy youngster named Julie, who, it turns out, is not at all what she appears to be. Worse yet, kids are disappearing. Can Julie-- and, through her, Melanie-- figure out what's going on before she becomes the target?

Yeah, it's a pretty standard mystery with supernatural elements, but nothing here feels clich&eacute;d, the way that such things often do. Pipes is a decent actress, and the Cleveland Brothers' (Souls' Midnight) script gives her a good, meaty part to sink her teeth into. There's also a strong supporting cast, including Lou Diamond Phillips in his best role (as a hapless guidance counselor) in close to a decade, and Geoffrey Lewis, one of those character actors who always seems to show up at just the right time (he also showed up in one of the better After Dark releases, Wicked Little Things, the same year this was released).

A very enjoyable film all around, and one that you probably missed, given that theatrically it showed on just two screens (horror film festivals in New York and LA). It found its way to DVD earlier this year; hunt it down and give it a chance. You'll be glad you did. *** ",1223510400,6,3009,4.691287878787879
3059967,1,B00114UUA4,"I found it interesting that the location of the urban legend has been relocated to a small town.  San Antonians know that this urban legend occurred in this third largest city of Texas.

Urban legend:  A busload of kids were killed as a train plowed into the stuck bus.  These days, you can park your car over the haunted tracks and put it in neutral.  Pour powder over the back window and rear bumper and wait.  Some people swear that they could feel the car moving forward and see fingerprints of the deceased children.

Melanie, fresh out of rehab, rejoins her family in their new home in a small Texan town.  Soon, she is visited by a ghost girl, who is one of the deceased from that terrible tragedy, which has since been an urban legend.

As soon as she shares her experience with others, she's immediately accused of using drugs again.  Despite the accusation, Melanie decides to investigate what actually happened on that terrible night.  Plus, she doesn't have a choice because someone is killing people, one by one, near the accident site.

Low budget, bad acting and a lousy script generally mean that it's a terrible movie.  *Fingerprints*, unfortunately, falls into this category.  You're not missing anything if you don't watch this.",1219449600,6,1247,4.766355140186916
3059968,4,B00114UUA4,"The title of ""Fingerprints"" refers to the marks left by the ghosts of dead children when they make their appearance.  There was a tragedy in the small town the movie takes place in when, decades ago, a train slammed into a school bus that was stalled on the tracks, killing everyone onboard; in the modern day, there's a legend that if you park a car on those tracks, it will be pushed off the tracks and to safety by an invisible prescence - only fingerprints on the bumper or car's back remain, indicating it was the ghosts of the crash victims, trying to prevent any other accident from occuring on that spot.  But what's always apparantly been just an urban legend starts to come true...

  The catalyst for the change comes when a girl named Melanie (well played by Leah Pipes) returns home after a stay in an out-of-town hospital.  When Melanie and her friends try out the local legend, the car actually does move off the tracks.  And shortly thereafter more supernatural occurences start happening.  Melanie was in the hospital after an incident that left her legally dead for two minutes; it seems that her brush with death has resulted in her being able to interact with spirits more closely, and once near those haunted tracks...  However, things may not be what they seem.  It turns out that there are rumors that the crash all those years ago never happened at all, although how or why someone would fake something like that is unknown.  In addition to the spirit appearances, new deaths start to occur as an unknown assailant begins slashing through various people connected in one way or another with the tracks and/or the legend.

  ""Fingerpints"" blends its 'haunting' story with 'stalk-and-slash' elements very well, coming out with a distinctive movie based on a fresh storyline.  And it does tie the different plot threads together in the end, leaving off with a powerful finale plus an opening for a possible follow-up (which I personally would be in favor of, although it might be tricky to reopen one of the plot threads that seems pretty much resolved).  In addition to Pipes's performance, the rest of the cast does a good job too, with Lou Diamond Phillips deserving special mention for his role as a teacher/guidance counsellor at the local high school.

  Aside from a couple of film festival appearances, this one went direct to DVD.  Direct-to-DVD titles have an unjustly bad rep; personally I've always thought there were quite a few gems in among the weaker entries, but over the last little while the ratio of quality direct-DVD titles has been picking up.  With the number of theatrically released horror movies in a bit of a dry spell, it's good to know that the original DVD releases are picking up the slack.",1217376000,19,2743,4.7568710359408035
3059969,3,B00114UUA4,"Starring Leah Pipes, Kristin Cavallari, Josh Henderson, Andrew Lawrence, Lou Diamond Phillips, and Geoffrey Lewis.  I saw the preview for this movie and thought it looked promising--like a decent low-budget ghost story. It starts off interesting enough...a high school girl (Pipes) comes out of rehab and moves to the town of Emerald. Her sister (Cavallari) tells her the train tracks are haunted because a bus full of school children were hit by a train years earlier. She attempts to adjust to her new life and she catches the attention of two of her male classmates (Henderson and Lawrence). Life becomes even more complicated when she starts seeing a girl who had died in the bus crash and so she now must find out what actually happened to the children who died in the crash.

The first half builds like it will be a spooky ghost-story. The second half of the movie is were it falls apart, because all of a sudden it becomes a typical teenage slasher movie--a badly done Nightmare on Elm Street rip-off. The deaths are ridiculous and unoriginal and seem to come out of nowhere. The movie has a very made-for-t.v feel, except for the strong language. The lead actress is quite good and I always love to see Lou Diamond Philips and Geoffrey Lewis;  however, some of the other actors inexperience (especially the mother) showed through too much.

Overall, if you know the tale or just want to watch it out of curiosity--rent it first. It's a two-in-a-half star movie, I just bumped it up because of the actors.",1210723200,24,1512,4.737642585551331
3059970,1,B00114UUA4,"Could have been good in the hands of a more accomplished, more talented crew.  The story is very very very familiar, but I'd be willing to overlook that if this film had been done with any understanding of suspense and horror.  The makers should be forced to watch a legendary creepy movie such as the original Halloween 1,000 times as punishment for producing this piece of garbage.",1209340800,8,383,4.701492537313433
3059971,5,B00114UUA4,"I was able to catch Fingerprints over the weekend at Texas Frightmare Weekend and have already pre-ordered my DVD. This movie rocked! I didn't know what to expect, and I knew it was based on a Texas urban legend, but I was surprised at where the movie took me.

The ghost kids are pretty creepy and it was great seeing actors like Loud Diamond Philips. I must admit I thought I had predicted what was going to happen but I am happy to report I was wrong.

If you're in the mood for a good old fashioned ghost/slasher horror movie then Fingerprints should do the trick.",1204070400,33,568,4.349056603773585

Well then you'll LOVE this movie, because the creative team behind it found a way to make it happen again...and again...and again. Oh, and wait'll you hear THIS. Not just anyone is putting their car in neutral and waiting for creepy stuff to happen. LOU DIAMOND PHILLIPS is putting his car into neutral and waiting for creepy stuff to happen.
And I watched before you. Jealous?
Oh, there's more. How about this: a movie about small town life created by people who seem never to have lived in a small town.
Or this: A movie about high school kids in which the high school kids are portrayed as obnoxious, unlikeable idiots who are not amusing in the least.
And wait till you hear about the special effects: All of the actors are made out of cardboard! And yet they look just like real human people. The ONLY way that you can tell they're really made of cardboard is by the fact that when they attempt to act, it is very obvious that they are actually made of cardboard.

if the children never died by getting hit by the train, then why the hell would the children care about pushing any vehicle across the tracks in the first place? Makes no sense-  The only motivation the children had to push the vehicles across the tracks, was to save the people in the car from being hit by the train like the children were.... but that's not the case. the children were never hit by any train in the first place- they were murdered!

The mystery surround the towns past is truly fascinating, but the accompanying slasher part completely takes away from what is otherwise a very good story. Melanie and her family move from the big city to a small town after a recent tragedy. Once there, Melanie becomes obsessed with a local urban legend and decides to discover the truth behind it with the helps of some ghost children. Leah Pipes gives an absolutely amazing performance as Melanie. I hate it when such a great performance goes to waste because it's in some limit release horror film. I'd never even heard of her before this film, but she was so engaging and really got me into this film. Her sister in the movie is played by Kristin Cavallari, who is possibly the best looking girl I've ever seen. She didn't have as big a role in the movie, but she was so supportive and sweet when everyone thought her sister was crazy. Fingerprints seems like a cheesy b-horror movie, with it's poor cinematography and inexperienced supporting cast, but in reality, it's a fantasy story intermingled with a completely unnecessary secondary plot.

The acting is very ho-hum, and honestly, I fell asleep at one point.

Everytime the mother opened her mouth I wanted to slap her, she sounded very scripted and just seemed to have a giant chip on her shoulder. The father was a major push over that just went along with everything the mother said. He seriously needed to grow a pair. The sister, while slightly annoying wasn't that bad. The only character that did a pretty good job was the main character. Her performance was decent.

As for the actual plot, it was just really stupid. What started out as a mysterious plot turned into a confusing slasher movie. The plot was all over the place, not cohesive at all.

3060108,2,B00114UUA4,"Based on an urban legend about ghosts pushing cars on railroad tracks, Fingerprints (2006) is a tale of suspense featuring a teenage girl playing detective.  The story seems padded with clichd plot elements, to flesh out what is a rather barebones premise.  It all somehow plays like a bad episode of Scooby Doo, with some problematic acting performances.

According to legend, in the town of Emerald, Texas, a school bus loaded with kids was hit by a train at the railroad crossing.  After this tragedy, supposedly if you park on the tracks and put the car in neutral, the ghosts of dead children will push the car to safety, sometimes leaving fingerprints on the vehicle.  After being in rehab, teenager Melanie Wood (Leah Pipes) rejoins her family, who have recently moved to Emerald.  Mel is well received by her older sister Crystal (Kristin Cavallari) and her father (Darryl Cox), but her mother (Ginger Gilmartin) appears to have some trust issues.

The story briefly touches on Melanie's time in school, where she gets some counseling from Doug Perrywine (Lou Diamond Phillips), but Mel's fascination with the ghostly legend, becomes the basis of the film, as she repeatedly finds herself in a car parked on the railroad crossing, or hanging around the old abandoned train station, sometimes with her new friend Penn (Josh Henderson).  When Mel surprisingly experiences the phenomena of having her car pushed off the tracks, she also has an encounter with a little girl named Julie (Sydnee Harlan), that leads her to Mary Pearl (Sally Kirkland), the daughter of the conductor of the train that struck the school bus.  After Mel has a supernatural experience involving Julie, she becomes convinced that the little girl is asking for help, and during her investigation, discovers that Mary Pearl had a sister named Julie, who was killed in the bus accident.

The level of action ramps up in the third act, and while the excitement is certainly welcome, the writing doesn't do a credible job of connecting together the various action sequences.  In stretching out a small story into a full length feature, the writers must believe that they can get away with anything, as the big reveal about the bus accident, long hidden crimes, and a secret dungeon, are pretty laughable.  The motivation for all the mayhem involving the construction of a new roadway, is like something right out of Scooby Doo.

Seventeen year old Leah Pipes seems mature for her age, and does a satisfactory job in the lead role, while an animated Sally Kirkland does her best to make things fun.  The writing isn't as kind to some of the other characters, who come off as rather cartoonish.  The practical effects are mostly good, with a couple of gory kills.  Some of the other effects, like speeded up footage of a moving train, and some fast cut editing, aren't very convincing.  Apparently intended for an audience that isn't very critical, Fingerprints throws a lot of things into the mix, trying to keep things interesting, but ultimately delivers almost as many laughs as thrills, earning a rating of 2.5 stars.",1316563200,,3095,4.921153846153846
3060109,2,B00114UUA4,"Early into it, I got the vibe this was going to be a stinker of a movie.  It would occasionally seem to redeem itself because of the relatively strong performance from the main character, but then something (or someone) stupid would come along to mess it up.  The biggest problem is the characters. Everyone is basically a caricature. Overly attentive and compassionate teacher? Check.  Cold-hearted parent that suspects their child of being a junkie? Check. Horny teen punk who attacks the attractive new girl? Check. Good looking jock with the heart of gold? Check. Small-town hick cop who thinks he's Columbo? Check and mate.  I could have overlooked the silly plot (most horror movies don't exactly excel at this department), but I kept marveling at how bad the characters were. Not bad acting per se (though some were doozies for sure)... Just badly written characters.

I get that its been fashionable for years now to make movies out of urban legends. Some have succeeded with the formula (Candyman comes to mind), but most movies that try, like this one, end up being worse than forgettable... I'll always remember this movie for how annoyed I was by it.  Why am I giving this 2 stars instead of 1?  Leah Pipes single-handedly saves it from 1-star because she puts in a pretty good performance (given the material she was handed) and did make herself into a likable lead character.

On the flipside:  There's lots of bad acting but not so bad it will have you laughing, more like wincing.  The lead's mother is especially wooden and should stop her botox injections because its preventing her to emote at all. Stupid subplot of drug rehab slows things down quite a bit.....almost stalls the action on more than one occasion. A token rape attempt scene and suicide fall flat in an attempt to nicely wrap up all the loose ends so we hate the bad guys and shallowly wish for their unexpected demise.  Production values are A+.

This movie was actually pretty good and great for a low budget film. It did give me goose bumps a few times and had me guessing. I liked that this wasn't just a scary movie and it actually had a murder mystery to it. There was very little nudity (and when I say very little I mean one part and is like a 5 to 6 second breast shot) which I also liked because for some reason most low budget films always have a lot of nudity in it because they think it will be better or because it will get more people to watch it. There were parts when certain characters died that I was kind of like ""they could have done that better,"" but it wasn't the way the character was killed, it was the way the character acted. There were only a couple unbelievable parts that you could tell the character lacked in acting skills, but it wasn't horrible enough for me to stop watching it. The ending was pretty good too. The only thing I didn't like about the ending was that they should have just ended it before they showed the two new characters making fun of the ghost story at the train tracks.

Something about her brush with death allows her to sometimes see dead people. However, don't let that make you think this is some kind of copy of The Sixth Sense, it is far from it.

I would not call this movie a horror, it's more a suspense tale with a few frights thrown in here and there to tell the story of Melanie being seen as someone going insane while trying to solve the mystery of what happened to these kids 30 years before the set time of the movie.

If not for a few (accidental, I'm convinced) interesting story ideas and, again, some decent acting on the part of some, this would have become a one star movie once and for all after the viewer is finally subjected to what might be the single worst post-climax gotchya shocker endings I've ever seen - one of those stupid ""it ain't really over folks, fooled ya didn't we"" final moments that is the sure sign of a truly untalented screenwriter (two, in this case - brothers, apparently).

Don't even waste your money on a $1 rental. You're better off re-watching Carpenter's The Fog if you're in the mood for a slasheresque ghost story.",1234742400,4,1035,4.782122905027933

3294463,4,B00114UUA4,"Fingerprints (Harry Basil, 2006)

You've heard of the After Dark Horrorfest, right? Eight movies supposedly ""too scary to be released in theaters"" every year that are actually one step above (or, in some painful cases, one step below) Sci-Fi Channel Original Movies? Well, every once in a while I run across a movie that would have been absolutely perfect for After Dark that they somehow missed, probably because it's too well-made to actually bear the title-- it would make all the really mediocre movies look even more mediocre than they actually are. Fingerprints struck me this way; it's not all that good a movie, being both entirely unscary and entirely predictable, and thus it's perfect After Dark fodder, but it's well-made and well-acted enough that it would stand out in a typical After Dark lineup like a glowing beacon of sanity.

Melanie (Pixel Perfect's Leah Pipes, all grown up) gets out of rehab and heads back home-- except ""home"" is now somewhere different, as her family moved to a new town while she was locked up. Her bubbly sister Crystal (Kristin Cavallari of the upcoming Green Flash in her first big-screen appearance) tries to help Melanie fit into the new digs as much as possible, but word got out, and the kids in her new high school already think of her as a freak. It doesn't help that it seems she sees ghosts. The town's local urban legend involves leaving one's car in neutral on a set of railroad tracks, which will encourage the ghosts of a number of children who died in a horrible bus/train collision in the fifties to push your car off the tracks, leaving fingerprints on your bumper if you've coated it in baby powder (thus the movie's name). Everyone knows it's just an urban legend (in the movie, anyway-- I've seen at least two claims that this is based on a true story, both of them, of course, in different towns), but Melanie befriends a shy youngster named Julie, who, it turns out, is not at all what she appears to be. Worse yet, kids are disappearing. Can Julie-- and, through her, Melanie-- figure out what's going on before she becomes the target?

Yeah, it's a pretty standard mystery with supernatural elements, but nothing here feels clich&eacute;d, the way that such things often do. Pipes is a decent actress, and the Cleveland Brothers' (Souls' Midnight) script gives her a good, meaty part to sink her teeth into. There's also a strong supporting cast, including Lou Diamond Phillips in his best role (as a hapless guidance counselor) in close to a decade, and Geoffrey Lewis, one of those character actors who always seems to show up at just the right time (he also showed up in one of the better After Dark releases, Wicked Little Things, the same year this was released).

A very enjoyable film all around, and one that you probably missed, given that theatrically it showed on just two screens (horror film festivals in New York and LA). It found its way to DVD earlier this year; hunt it down and give it a chance. You'll be glad you did. *** ",1223510400,6,3009,4.691287878787879
3294464,1,B00114UUA4,"I found it interesting that the location of the urban legend has been relocated to a small town.  San Antonians know that this urban legend occurred in this third largest city of Texas.

Urban legend:  A busload of kids were killed as a train plowed into the stuck bus.  These days, you can park your car over the haunted tracks and put it in neutral.  Pour powder over the back window and rear bumper and wait.  Some people swear that they could feel the car moving forward and see fingerprints of the deceased children.

Melanie, fresh out of rehab, rejoins her family in their new home in a small Texan town.  Soon, she is visited by a ghost girl, who is one of the deceased from that terrible tragedy, which has since been an urban legend.

As soon as she shares her experience with others, she's immediately accused of using drugs again.  Despite the accusation, Melanie decides to investigate what actually happened on that terrible night.  Plus, she doesn't have a choice because someone is killing people, one by one, near the accident site.

Low budget, bad acting and a lousy script generally mean that it's a terrible movie.  *Fingerprints*, unfortunately, falls into this category.  You're not missing anything if you don't watch this.",1219449600,6,1247,4.766355140186916
3294465,4,B00114UUA4,"The title of ""Fingerprints"" refers to the marks left by the ghosts of dead children when they make their appearance.  There was a tragedy in the small town the movie takes place in when, decades ago, a train slammed into a school bus that was stalled on the tracks, killing everyone onboard; in the modern day, there's a legend that if you park a car on those tracks, it will be pushed off the tracks and to safety by an invisible prescence - only fingerprints on the bumper or car's back remain, indicating it was the ghosts of the crash victims, trying to prevent any other accident from occuring on that spot.  But what's always apparantly been just an urban legend starts to come true...

  The catalyst for the change comes when a girl named Melanie (well played by Leah Pipes) returns home after a stay in an out-of-town hospital.  When Melanie and her friends try out the local legend, the car actually does move off the tracks.  And shortly thereafter more supernatural occurences start happening.  Melanie was in the hospital after an incident that left her legally dead for two minutes; it seems that her brush with death has resulted in her being able to interact with spirits more closely, and once near those haunted tracks...  However, things may not be what they seem.  It turns out that there are rumors that the crash all those years ago never happened at all, although how or why someone would fake something like that is unknown.  In addition to the spirit appearances, new deaths start to occur as an unknown assailant begins slashing through various people connected in one way or another with the tracks and/or the legend.

  ""Fingerpints"" blends its 'haunting' story with 'stalk-and-slash' elements very well, coming out with a distinctive movie based on a fresh storyline.  And it does tie the different plot threads together in the end, leaving off with a powerful finale plus an opening for a possible follow-up (which I personally would be in favor of, although it might be tricky to reopen one of the plot threads that seems pretty much resolved).  In addition to Pipes's performance, the rest of the cast does a good job too, with Lou Diamond Phillips deserving special mention for his role as a teacher/guidance counsellor at the local high school.

  Aside from a couple of film festival appearances, this one went direct to DVD.  Direct-to-DVD titles have an unjustly bad rep; personally I've always thought there were quite a few gems in among the weaker entries, but over the last little while the ratio of quality direct-DVD titles has been picking up.  With the number of theatrically released horror movies in a bit of a dry spell, it's good to know that the original DVD releases are picking up the slack.",1217376000,19,2743,4.7568710359408035
3294466,3,B00114UUA4,"Starring Leah Pipes, Kristin Cavallari, Josh Henderson, Andrew Lawrence, Lou Diamond Phillips, and Geoffrey Lewis.  I saw the preview for this movie and thought it looked promising--like a decent low-budget ghost story. It starts off interesting enough...a high school girl (Pipes) comes out of rehab and moves to the town of Emerald. Her sister (Cavallari) tells her the train tracks are haunted because a bus full of school children were hit by a train years earlier. She attempts to adjust to her new life and she catches the attention of two of her male classmates (Henderson and Lawrence). Life becomes even more complicated when she starts seeing a girl who had died in the bus crash and so she now must find out what actually happened to the children who died in the crash.

The first half builds like it will be a spooky ghost-story. The second half of the movie is were it falls apart, because all of a sudden it becomes a typical teenage slasher movie--a badly done Nightmare on Elm Street rip-off. The deaths are ridiculous and unoriginal and seem to come out of nowhere. The movie has a very made-for-t.v feel, except for the strong language. The lead actress is quite good and I always love to see Lou Diamond Philips and Geoffrey Lewis;  however, some of the other actors inexperience (especially the mother) showed through too much.

Overall, if you know the tale or just want to watch it out of curiosity--rent it first. It's a two-in-a-half star movie, I just bumped it up because of the actors.",1210723200,24,1512,4.737642585551331

Melanie and her family move from the big city to a small town after a recent tragedy. Once there, Melanie becomes obsessed with a local urban legend and decides to discover the truth behind it with the helps of some ghost children. Leah Pipes gives an absolutely amazing performance as Melanie. I hate it when such a great performance goes to waste because it's in some limit release horror film. I'd never even heard of her before this film, but she was so engaging and really got me into this film. Her sister in the movie is played by Kristin Cavallari, who is possibly the best looking girl I've ever seen. She didn't have as big a role in the movie, but she was so supportive and sweet when everyone thought her sister was crazy. Fingerprints seems like a cheesy b-horror movie, with it's poor cinematography and inexperienced supporting cast, but in reality, it's a fantasy story intermingled with a completely unnecessary secondary plot.

3294605,2,B00114UUA4,"Based on an urban legend about ghosts pushing cars on railroad tracks, Fingerprints (2006) is a tale of suspense featuring a teenage girl playing detective.  The story seems padded with clichd plot elements, to flesh out what is a rather barebones premise.  It all somehow plays like a bad episode of Scooby Doo, with some problematic acting performances.

According to legend, in the town of Emerald, Texas, a school bus loaded with kids was hit by a train at the railroad crossing.  After this tragedy, supposedly if you park on the tracks and put the car in neutral, the ghosts of dead children will push the car to safety, sometimes leaving fingerprints on the vehicle.  After being in rehab, teenager Melanie Wood (Leah Pipes) rejoins her family, who have recently moved to Emerald.  Mel is well received by her older sister Crystal (Kristin Cavallari) and her father (Darryl Cox), but her mother (Ginger Gilmartin) appears to have some trust issues.

The story briefly touches on Melanie's time in school, where she gets some counseling from Doug Perrywine (Lou Diamond Phillips), but Mel's fascination with the ghostly legend, becomes the basis of the film, as she repeatedly finds herself in a car parked on the railroad crossing, or hanging around the old abandoned train station, sometimes with her new friend Penn (Josh Henderson).  When Mel surprisingly experiences the phenomena of having her car pushed off the tracks, she also has an encounter with a little girl named Julie (Sydnee Harlan), that leads her to Mary Pearl (Sally Kirkland), the daughter of the conductor of the train that struck the school bus.  After Mel has a supernatural experience involving Julie, she becomes convinced that the little girl is asking for help, and during her investigation, discovers that Mary Pearl had a sister named Julie, who was killed in the bus accident.

The level of action ramps up in the third act, and while the excitement is certainly welcome, the writing doesn't do a credible job of connecting together the various action sequences.  In stretching out a small story into a full length feature, the writers must believe that they can get away with anything, as the big reveal about the bus accident, long hidden crimes, and a secret dungeon, are pretty laughable.  The motivation for all the mayhem involving the construction of a new roadway, is like something right out of Scooby Doo.

Seventeen year old Leah Pipes seems mature for her age, and does a satisfactory job in the lead role, while an animated Sally Kirkland does her best to make things fun.  The writing isn't as kind to some of the other characters, who come off as rather cartoonish.  The practical effects are mostly good, with a couple of gory kills.  Some of the other effects, like speeded up footage of a moving train, and some fast cut editing, aren't very convincing.  Apparently intended for an audience that isn't very critical, Fingerprints throws a lot of things into the mix, trying to keep things interesting, but ultimately delivers almost as many laughs as thrills, earning a rating of 2.5 stars.",1316563200,,3095,4.921153846153846
3294606,2,B00114UUA4,"Early into it, I got the vibe this was going to be a stinker of a movie.  It would occasionally seem to redeem itself because of the relatively strong performance from the main character, but then something (or someone) stupid would come along to mess it up.  The biggest problem is the characters. Everyone is basically a caricature. Overly attentive and compassionate teacher? Check.  Cold-hearted parent that suspects their child of being a junkie? Check. Horny teen punk who attacks the attractive new girl? Check. Good looking jock with the heart of gold? Check. Small-town hick cop who thinks he's Columbo? Check and mate.  I could have overlooked the silly plot (most horror movies don't exactly excel at this department), but I kept marveling at how bad the characters were. Not bad acting per se (though some were doozies for sure)... Just badly written characters.

I get that its been fashionable for years now to make movies out of urban legends. Some have succeeded with the formula (Candyman comes to mind), but most movies that try, like this one, end up being worse than forgettable... I'll always remember this movie for how annoyed I was by it.  Why am I giving this 2 stars instead of 1?  Leah Pipes single-handedly saves it from 1-star because she puts in a pretty good performance (given the material she was handed) and did make herself into a likable lead character.

On the flipside:  There's lots of bad acting but not so bad it will have you laughing, more like wincing.  The lead's mother is especially wooden and should stop her botox injections because its preventing her to emote at all. Stupid subplot of drug rehab slows things down quite a bit.....almost stalls the action on more than one occasion. A token rape attempt scene and suicide fall flat in an attempt to nicely wrap up all the loose ends so we hate the bad guys and shallowly wish for their unexpected demise.  Production values are A+.

I liked that this wasn't just a scary movie and it actually had a murder mystery to it. There was very little nudity (and when I say very little I mean one part and is like a 5 to 6 second breast shot) which I also liked because for some reason most low budget films always have a lot of nudity in it because they think it will be better or because it will get more people to watch it. There were parts when certain characters died that I was kind of like ""they could have done that better,"" but it wasn't the way the character was killed, it was the way the character acted. There were only a couple unbelievable parts that you could tell the character lacked in acting skills, but it wasn't horrible enough for me to stop watching it. The ending was pretty good too. The only thing I didn't like about the ending was that they should have just ended it before they showed the two new characters making fun of the ghost story at the train tracks.

3294627,1,B00114UUA4,I cried...couldn't believe I subjected myself to watch the whole movie. If you are bored out of your mind and just need something to watch...I think I would still look for a better flick.,1245888000,2,187,4.529411764705882
3294628,4,B00114UUA4,"A 50yo urban legend, a masked killer, and a dark secret held by an entire town combine to form the story for FINGERPRINTS. A recovering teen girl (Leah Pipes) returns to her family after rehab, only to be plunged into the middle of the ghostly mystery. Is the legend for real? Are the restless spirits of long-dead children roaming the steets of Emerald? Could be! Lou Diamond Phillips is the ill-fated school guidance counselor. Geoffrey Lewis is the town drunk (w/ a major piece of the puzzle). Also starring ber-hottie Kristin Cavallari as Crystal! My goodness...",1244592000,,566,4.90625
3294629,4,B00114UUA4,"When Melanie Somebody arrives in town to be greeted by her sister, Crystal, she tells her of an urban myth in the town about stopping at a rail way crossing, where if you put the car in neutral the ghosts of children that supposedly died there push your car over the tracks out of danger.

Eventually, Melanie discovers it is no myth, and there is more to the story then what the myth tells. Melanie arrives late in there new town due to being in re-hab after she overdosed. Something about her brush with death allows her to sometimes see dead people. However, don't let that make you think this is some kind of copy of The Sixth Sense, it is far from it.

I would not call this movie a horror, it's more a suspense tale with a few frights thrown in here and there to tell the story of Melanie being seen as someone going insane while trying to solve the mystery of what happened to these kids 30 years before the set time of the movie.

Overall, I loved this movie. I don't know really what do compare it to to give you an idea of what kind of movie it is, it has it's mystery, suspense, thrills and a who is the killer kind of thing, is it supernatural, or is it just a naughty person? You will have to see it and find out for yourself.

I really would recommend you rent this movie if you liked movies like the The 6th Sense, Supernatural... or movies that are not made for horror and blood and gore, but just a suspense ride with a supernatural element.",1236038400,,1458,4.196428571428571
3294630,2,B00114UUA4,"It's very difficult for me to understand four and five star, and even three star, reviews of Fingerprints. The talent of a relatively good lead actress are wasted in a movie which meanders back and forth between a ghost story and a slasher plot. The lame, hackneyed, predictable ""climax"" is made even worse by amazingly amateurish performances on the part of other actors, and by abysmal directing. If not for a few (accidental, I'm convinced) interesting story ideas and, again, some decent acting on the part of some, this would have become a one star movie once and for all after the viewer is finally subjected to what might be the single worst post-climax gotchya shocker endings I've ever seen - one of those stupid ""it ain't really over folks, fooled ya didn't we"" final moments that is the sure sign of a truly untalented screenwriter (two, in this case - brothers, apparently).

Don't even waste your money on a $1 rental. You're better off re-watching Carpenter's The Fog if you're in the mood for a slasheresque ghost story.",1234742400,4,1035,4.782122905027933
3294631,4,B00114UUA4,"If you have ever vistied the original ghost track on the south side of San Antonio, then you know what this movie is all about.  For those of us who have actually experienced the phenomenon, we know this film to be a true story.  The movie does not exactly mirror the orginal Texas tale, but has some good acting and a good twist to the story.  A tale of a bad school bus accident where several small children died when a train collided with their school bus and now will not allow this tradjedy to happen again by pushing any stalled vehicle off the track and leaving their fingerprints behind.  The movie will keep you entertained and even give you a start or two, worth owning for horror fans.",1232755200,,696,4.372093023255814

3294633,3,B00114UUA4,"The first half of this movie seemed like it had potential and was interesting.  Unfortunately, about halfway through it became predictable and very stupid.  The laughable ending made it seem like a completely different movie by the time it was over.  Too bad.  Worth a watch if you're bored, but just don't expect much after it hits the halfway point.

It was well done. There were twists and turns. The heroine was sympathetic and believable. Most people who live in rural locations can fully understand the desire of a family to maintain ""status.""",1223942400,2,401,4.493150684931507
