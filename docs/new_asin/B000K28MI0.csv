2681776,5,B000K28MI0,"Ok,
Everyone else said it much better than I can; this is a ""pack"" full of information, on DVD!
So I will tell you how it makes me feel, I am a woman so I can get away
with it. :~0
My wish is to own a hobby farm, live off the land and gridless.
 BUT UNTILL
my dream comes true [any farmers need a helper ;-)] watching this DVD will do.
I love birds have one cat, three rats, 8 finch, 2 keets and had 1 canary - opps.
Maybe I was a bird in an other life.  ;-) tweet, chirp and cluck.
Love the information and WOW great out buildings for the chickens, great
peace of land.  When I get the city blues I pop in this DVD and pretend I
own the farm.
Hope you do more on chickens and their care, diseases, and behavior.  Maybe like a mini course in a college ""like a box set"".  Remember the old
Firefox stuff, (in the late 1960's, Eliot Wigginton and his students created the magazine Foxfire in an effort to record and preserve the traditional folk culture of the Southern Appalachians. This is the original book compilation of Foxfire material which introduces Aunt Arie and her contemporaries and includes log cabin building, hog dressing, snake lore, mountain crafts and food, and ""other affairs of plain living"".  Your daughters picture on the DVD reminded me of that.
I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY COOL, great information on nature - even if all I do is chat about my interest.

I would watch it just to dream and relax, maybe I can will myself to own
a farm.

Fan of your DVD, city chick",1202169600,2,1484,4.200704225352113
2681777,5,B000K28MI0,"Regarding Chickens with Frederick J. Dunn is a must see DVD. After reading and purchasing several books, and watching some DVDs on the topic of raising the birds, this DVD proved to be as valuable as all the books and DVDs combined.
My first DVD, The Natural History of the Chicken, was entertaining but hardly informative. I also purchased the DVD Beginners Guide to Raising and Showing Chickens. While the latter was enjoyable and informative-- especially the section on diseases-- much of its content focused on showing birds, and it was nowhere near as exhaustive as Fred Dunn's video.
Each segment of Dunn's DVD is thoughtfully presented and explained in simple and clear detail. From incubation of eggs, to housing, raising, feeding, and bedding, so much information is given and demonstrated that you'll be amazed.
Running time is approximately 3 hours, rather long, but worth every minute. If you buy only one DVD on this topic, I encourage you to make it this one. After a month, not only do still I review it repeatedly with my family in anticipation of getting chicks in the spring, but I'm still amazed at the wealth and simplicity of  the information it contains. Clearly, a  lot of time was put into the making of this DVD, and beginners--I daresay, probably even some pros--will learn a lot from it. Purchasing Regarding Chickens will be money well spent.",1200787200,25,1370,4.875536480686695
2681778,5,B000K28MI0,"This is an invaluable resource to have on hand if you have, or are considering having, chickens at home.  Fred himself was extremely helpful, prompt and courteous during the shipping process. I highly recommend this DVD to all chicken/poultry fans.",1200009600,4,248,5.2
2681779,5,B000K28MI0,"What a TERRIFIC resource ""REGARDING CHICKENS"" has become to me.  This year is my FIRST attempt at having chickens in my life.  Although there are several good resources out there, REGARDING CHICKENS offers something that NO OTHER resource offers.  Fred offers step by step ""how-to's"" through the magic of video.  To actually WATCH what he talks about rather than simply reading it was TRULY helpful to me.  A picture REALLY IS worth a thousand words!  Several years ago I was in a car accident that left me with a brain injury.  It has caused me to have a LOT of trouble focusing on reading and retaining information.  To be able to visualize educational topics about my brand new hobby is a gift for which I cannot thank Fred's Fine Fowl enough!!  Not ONLY do I get to see what he is talking about - but when I want to revisit ANY topic, I can simply pop the DVD in and go directly to that particular section. I only wish I had discovered this DVD earlier!  My hatch was only Semi-successful this year - and now I KNOW what mistakes I made.  I have NO DOUBT that next year, with Fred's help, I will have GRAND success!  It is an invaluable tool for ANYONE starting out with chickens or anyone who needs a little professional advice right in your own home!  Thanks you SO MUCH for putting this together!!  You have no doubt saved MANY chickens lives! My chickens thank you too! They were SO TIRED of the messy water containers and the empty feed troughs.  It may sound simple, but unless someone has shown a person who is new to this hobby how to elevate feeders and waterers - it may not occur to them. Little hints & tips like this have TRULY made a difference in my enjoyment of this hobby.  Additionally, the information on NPIP, Vaccines, Diatomaceous Earth, Medicated feed usage, Obtaining chicks, and candling ~ WOW!!!  THANK YOU!!! THANK YOU!!! THANK YOU!!!!!

2681780,5,B000K28MI0,"There are so many fantastic things to say about Fred and this wonderful DVD and just not enough time! When I first saw this DVD I couldn't believe how much information was on it and how he went into detail on every subject, you can really tell he has a passion for his poultry! I have read tons and tons of books and information on the internet, and yes they did help some, but to actually see someone else doing it and knowing I can go back and check to make sure I'm doing it right is the best you can get. It is so much easier to learn when you see some else doing it. I learned so much on just hatching, candling and the incubation process, even though I have done it before and read so much about it, I learned stuff I never knew, and would of probaly never found out. Fred also shows his gorgeous chickens and beautiful land and amazingly built coops. I can't wait to see his next DVD and all the more to come! You are a great man Fred! Hope to keep in touch and keep up the good work! I will always go to you for my chicken questions! Thanks so much, Sophia Rich!",1168905600,9,1070,4.028169014084507
2681781,5,B000K28MI0,"I found this DVD to be informative and surprisingly entertaining.  Even my friends who aren't interested in raising chickens enjoyed this quirky video.  I've shown a few folks at my office too, and its a crowd pleaser.  In addition to its instructive and comprehensive content, the approach to animals and animal care is compassionate, honest, and insightful.  This video has given me the confidence and ability to get started with my own chickens.  Thanks!",1162857600,3,457,5.121621621621622
2681782,5,B000K28MI0,"This DVD is my ""chicken bible"".  Complete info on all subjects and concerns for the beginner to anyone considering the endeavor but are worried about everything involved because of lack of knowledge.  There is no doubt you can do it after watching this DVD. This is all that is needed to acquire the knowledge and confidence for the most insecure novice, like I was. I purchased fertile eggs, incubated and now are rearing chickens all with the help of Mr. Dunn's extensive and detailed knowledge which is all on this DVD.  I continuously view it as my chickens grow, the seasons change etc.,for directions on issues and how to proceed.

Rearing chickens is an enjoyable experience if complete knowledge is available and this one DVD is all you will need.  YOU CAN DO IT!",1162252800,8,771,4.723880597014926
2681783,4,B000K28MI0,"I like the dvd format because my husband and I can share the information at the same time.  You might find the same info in a book, but this dvd is helpful and useful.

For example, the topic of candeling the eggs you can actually see the variations and the shadows and what to look for.  A still photo would not be as helpful.

It was nice to see the variety of poultry and the show birds.

We especially enjoyed and appreciated the section on coops - lots of good tips there.

Since the dvd is divided into sections you can review just those topics that are of interest to you.

I don't think the dvd takes the place of good books on poultry, but it is certainly an interesting and useful addition to ones library.",1363132800,,716,4.220588235294118
2681784,5,B000K28MI0,"This, nearly 3-hour video, should be a great help to beginning chicken keepers and probably more experienced keepers as well.  The setting is Fred's farm where his chickens are allowed to free-range, so is more relevant to that venue.  Nevertheless, the video is very comprehensive and provides much useful information valuable to all type chicken raisers.  Every topic imaginable is covered to some degree - I am amazed at how much information is included in one video!  I also think the video is very well done.  I certainly would not classify it as ""home made"" which leaves the impression it is in the class of typical home movies.  Yes, it's not done by professional actors or film studio, but it is well thought out, clearly presented, and well filmed.  This video is a valuable practical resource to chicken growers.  I highly recommend it!",1332720000,2,846,4.8671328671328675
2681785,3,B000K28MI0,i had been loking forward to this video but i really wasn't what i expected. It just looked like something hand made. Should have saved my money!,1318809600,,145,4.407407407407407
2681786,3,B000K28MI0,"I bought this DVD because I am a total novice on chickens. I've raised finches and an occasional baby bird that fell out of it's nest, but I want to raise chickens for eggs and the benefits they provide in a garden. I found this DVD to be very interesting and entertaining but it didn't have nearly as much detailed information as I was hoping and expecting. It was in fact informative, but again, not as much as I had expected given the decription and reviews. The reviewers who say this is the only DVD you'll need seem to be far off the mark. I won't go as far as saying don't buy it, but I can't say it's all you need either.",1300406400,,629,4.121951219512195
2681787,5,B000K28MI0,"I purchased this DVD in preparation to getting chickens in the spring. It was very informative, lots of great tips and very easy to understand. He touches on many subjects. I found this to be very worthwhile and happy I bought it.",1284076800,,230,4.5
2681788,5,B000K28MI0,"If you are interested in starting poultry, this DVD is the first thing you should buy. Fred covers so much material. I was surprised at how much effort he made to produce and explain so many areas on the subject of raising chickens. He is truely an expert in this field!
  I raised chickens when I was younger but I lost many more than I did when I recieved my shipment a month ago. I believe the problem was that Fred's brooder is a smaller scale than mine. I built a 4 ft.x 4 ft. plywood square with a plywood floor. I ordered 50 chicks and many of them piled up under the one light. I added a second light on the third day and they started behaving like Fred's chickens in the video, (nice and calm and socially chirping). I only lost 2 chickens in the batch. This video covers just about everything. There were a few questions I had that the video did not cover but luckly Fred is very good at responding to emails from his website. In the video Fred explains that chickens need grit to grind up their food as well as remove particles of wood shavings they may ingest. I went to my local feed store and all they had was large grit for full grown chickens. I thought this was too big and wrote to Fred. He said there is something called chick grit and searched the hatchery I bought my chickens from and found the product. It has made a big difference in their growth. Thank you Fred for all the hard work you did on this video!! I watch the video over and over and still find bits and pieces I missed before. I highly recommend this video to anyone interested in keeping a healthy and happy flock!",1276300800,2,1601,4.2117263843648205
2681789,5,B000K28MI0,"This is a DVD that will never NOT be helpful. Other reviewers have correctly mentioned that the three hour running time flies by so quickly that you don't even notice. In fact I found myself wishing there was more!  A lot of work went into this DVD. It is nicely filmed with pleasant original background music.
Frederick Dunn is a calm knowledgeable presence, very comfortable in front of the camera. He is professional without being pretentious. He shares his expertise without being intimidating. This is very important to me. If I'm going to listen to someone for three hours (even if they are speaking about a subject that fascinates me) then they had better be a pleasant and enjoyable speaker!
Although Mr. Dunn covers many topics himself he also has some interesting segments with other special experts. I really enjoyed his interviews with a charming lady whose expertise is eggs and a champion poultry exhibitor.  I found myself going back and re- watching the egg lady once my hens started laying.
Mr. Dunn is a true teacher who enjoys sharing his knowledge and seems to genuinely care that our chickens are well kept! So many aspects of chicken care are covered. Some subjects that are not yet relevant to me will certainly be helpful as I my flock increases. I am not yet exhibiting, nor am I incubating fertile eggs but I am fortunate to have these segments to watch when I become more deeply involved in chicken keeping. I anticipate keeping this DVD in my playing rotation for a long time",1260662400,,1503,4.732824427480916
2681790,2,B000K28MI0,The website provides almost all the info free that is on the video so I was disappointed that it cost so much.,1242604800,,110,4.045454545454546
2681791,5,B000K28MI0,"This was my fist DVD on owning and caring for chickens.
It was really helpful by taking you through the process
of deciding what kind to keep; ordering the chicks; caring
for them once they arrive; and housing the grown birds.
There's a section explaining what to look for in quality
eggs and another helpful section on problems and diseases.
I particularly appreciated the section on housing and what
to choose for the flock. Also, the DVD covered showing birds
if you are interested in that. It's a very good resource to
have if you are interested in keeping chickesn.",1219622400,2,570,4.71

8153943,4,B000K28MI0,This is a stunningly informative DVD on the topic. The only reason not rated 5/5 was that it is in several separate  chapters with separate sub chapters that require u to manually select the next to move on. I loved it so much that I would have liked it to flow from one to next and one could always then select scenes if u wanted to go back to a point or topic. But the content was worth every cent!,1392508800,,400,4.0
