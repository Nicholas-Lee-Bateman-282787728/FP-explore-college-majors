6069557,5,B00GB0OVTE,"This was a different kind of movie. It was a good movie to watch with your girlfriend and not your man because it might bring up some questions and suggestions. I hope things like this does not really happen but if it does it is sad, no one should be in that kind of situation. Everyone deserve better for themselves.",1395100800,3,317,4.3

8621805,5,B00GB0OVTE,"This was a great date movie. However, the movie needed a film score. There was hardly any background music during the film. The plot, acting and direction were good. This film would be rated PG-13 for one F word and sexual situations. No profanity other than one F bomb no nudity or graphic sex, no violence. This film chronicles the ups and downs of a player and the women that he is involved with. Couples should watch this film and learn from it. Can a man remain faithful to his woman? Should women have sex on the first date? The answer is no to both questions. Do not have sex until you get married and you won't have any of the problems that the main character had in this film. I enjoyed this film because the script was well written and they didn't use foul language, sex and nudity to spice up the film. You cared for the main character and you wanted her to be happy. The supporting characters had roles that were fully developed and that made the film worth watching. Recommended for fans of romantic comedies and African American films.",1403481600,8,1049,4.4404145077720205
8621806,5,B00GB0OVTE,"I love it because it is vary true.  We all have a set of pattering that we look for or we are condition with.
Once we figure out what it is that we really want and are willing to deal with we can make better life choice in choosing our
hope to be life partners.",1403481600,4,261,3.7454545454545456
8621807,3,B00GB0OVTE,The movie demonstrated a lot of nonsense and just doesn't appear to be real.  None of the characters seem to have a real job.,1399420800,,125,4.208333333333333
