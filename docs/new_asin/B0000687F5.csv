1723230,5,B0000687F5,"The young and handsome samurai Kano is courted by some other samurai that dwell within the same walls.  This is observed by the elder samurai to be a not too uncommon phenomenon among the samurai, but it is something that is well concealed by them.  However, it seems like the attention that Kano is attracting is too obvious, which the elders try to prevent and reverse through the use of women.  Meanwhile, there is a struggle brewing among those who have mutual feelings for Kano and this is running in a disastrous direction.  Taboo is a film that portrays homosexuality in a male dominating society where men carry themselves with an outmost social confidence providing for terrific film experience.",1042070400,9,704,4.890756302521009
1723231,5,B0000687F5,"Japanese films have quickly become my favourite genre. I knew I had to rent Taboo. The acting is amazing, very believeable. The main character, Kano, is so perfect for the role: I have to admit that, even as a guy, I can say that he's very handsome. I found myself wanting to see more of him, but that's not to say that there was a lack of him.
  The first scene of the movie is a Kendo sparring match. Kendo is the Japanese art of swordfighting. Never have I come across such perfect, delightful Kendo demonstrations in a film. Watching the actors use their swords is almost like watching Mont paint in his garden. You always wanted to see it, and there it is, just as sleek and smoothe as you can imagine. The Kendo scenes are very inspiring, and truly remarkable.
  Throughout the film, there is a perfect balance of every event. Nothing is dwelled upon, and everything comes in the right amount. Every single image and scene is sharp, crisp, and refreshing. The camerawork is flawless, almost as if we see what exactly what we want to see, like in a vivid dream filled with delight.
  Anyone who likes foreign films should watch Taboo. It's quite an amazing film, and I have to say extremely well-done.",1040169600,10,1206,4.509174311926605
1723232,4,B0000687F5,"Along with gorgeous settings, the movie provides an edge of suspense one wouldn't expect. Overall, the film feels like a dream, picks up in various places, only to recede back to a somber pace. The exchanged dialogue really kept me on the edge of my toes, to see if any of the characters knew more than they would tell behind those stoic expressions... >_< However, I do have a taste for happy endings... which Taboo doesn't exactly provide. But it's not a fairy tale-- it's a character study of Japan in the 1800s. An excellent film to watch alone, and to contemplate afterwards.",1038700800,4,580,4.640776699029126
1723233,5,B0000687F5,"This is a really interesting film that captivates your attention from the beginging.  The dramatic actions of the characters speak for the movie itself.

1723234,5,B0000687F5,"This film displays the use of photography as film better than any other living director.  Watch The Royal Tennenbaums or Element of Crime and you think that every shot is a photograph.  Watch Madadayo, Ran, or The Celebration and every shot is an emotion.  Watch Taboo and every shot is a wood engraving on an antique piece of Japanese furniture.  An effect that cannot be said about any other film without possible consideration of Seven Samurai or Sanjuro.  Oshima has taken a simple piece of homoerotic film and has made a Jarman-like transcendance to something more.  And that is all I should have to say.  This is not just a film,  it is something more.  A good story alone is a book,  and a good story with brilliant scenery is enlightening.  You are seeing the reason why someone decided to give pictures motion.  This is not one of the best films I have seen,  but is one of the most beautiful pictures I have every spent a few hours looking at.",1037145600,7,953,4.502923976608187
1723235,4,B0000687F5,"Gohatto is the law, or the code. In this magnificent piece from the master of cinema Oshima Nagisa, Gohatto means something like a marshal law. With or without knowledge of the Shinsengumi, the movie offers plenty to viewers who like plots based upon samurai stories. However, instead of the fighting scenes on the battle fields like most of the stereotypical samurai movies, this one is ever so contriving about the human within the samurai with their physical and spiritual projections towards life, death and sex. Kano was portrayed as an utterly handsome youth recruited as a new member of the militia, who was inevitably attracted by a number of other militia members. Whirled within all these conflicting feelings among the wooers, Kano appeared to be composed and cold, with a sole goal towards the ""right to kill"". Tashiro, the rumored only lover of Kano, was suspected of killing another samurai, Yuzawa, who courted Kano as well and assaulted sergeant Yamazaki. Commando Kondo ordered him to be executed by the hands of Kano with captain Hijikata and lieutenant Soji watching afar. The movie ends with a surreal setting of the wilderness, with drizzling rains and smoky air where Soji and Hijikata exchanged their premise about love among men. Kano was finally able to execute Tashiro and retreated, likely with Soji. With his narration, Hijikata objected the evil behind Kano's beauty which was not only to woo the men in the militia, but also to lead the wish to violate the samurai codes. Stymied a beautifully blossomed cheery tree in one swift swing of his sword, Hijikata's mind was made to crush the beauty so as to preserve the sacred code of samurai.",1036022400,10,1669,4.943060498220641
1723236,4,B0000687F5,Interesting account of homosexuality in a group of samauri. What got me the most was the effect that the gay relationship had on the samauri as a group and as individuals. Also the growing pressure on the young and beautiful swordsman who was so inexperienced sexually. The swordplay was done well and the sets and camera work were excellant. Fine acting all around.,1034812800,6,366,4.825396825396825
1723237,5,B0000687F5,This movie is absolutely superb. The acting is amazing (I am a big fan of Beat Takeshi and he's genius in every movie he's in) and it's a work of art within itself. It has the feeling of a beautiful Japanese watercolor with flowing designs and fantastic scenes. Every scene is filled with elegance and careful attention to detail. The directing is more than superb and just the mere thought of this film makes me catch my breath.,1025308800,19,429,4.512820512820513
1723248,4,B0000687F5,"This movie was very enjoyable to watch. There are a lot of layers in the storyline, the scenery is great, the costumes are great, and the acting, especially, is great.

The movie is basically a bunch of psychological examinations of the characters with great sword fighting sequences in the middle (it seems like most of the actors know how to sword fight themselves without stunt doubles). A very intellectually stimulating movie.

DO NOT see this movie if you are interesting in learning about the homosexual community in Japan. The movie is fiction and it certainly does not try to venture into social commentary. The movie does not address social oppression or even how the characters feel about their homosexuality with any remote introspection. That is actually the reason I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5. It only vaguely awkwardly addresses the aforementioned things in one tiny subplot.",1213833600,,901,5.040268456375839
1723249,4,B0000687F5,"This film may be slow for our standards, as we are more related with quick action when thinking about samurais. However, it could be interesting if some previous ""clues"" are known.
1) Homoerotic relationships were accepted in Japan. It was until the 2nd half of 19th century, when Japan wanted to be cope with Western Culture, that these relationships vanished from public records.
2) Homoerotic relationships followed a cultural and social code, were ranking of those involved -lover, loved and their lord- were as important as the ways to offer your love to another man. Even hairdoes were related to roles (young pages used long locks and were loved-ones, grown-ups used adult hairdoes and were lovers, in the erastes-eromenos model, similar to Greeks). This film is based in that.
3) This film becomes a thriller, as main characters are breaking those rules and some murderers are planned, around a same-sex lovers couple.
4) To understand last scene, we must remember that poetic figure to describe someone beautiful and good is to compare her/him with a cherry blossom. Cutting it down means the guy is not worth admiring.
So, this film is interesting. If you want to read about homoerotics among samurais,look for a colection of short stories written by SAIKAKU IHARA in the 17th century. Those are cute!",1212969600,3,1311,5.018348623853211

1723252,5,B0000687F5,"This lovely film about a young man whose beauty eats other men's souls asks more questions than it answers.  Yay!  I've read so many reviews of this film that express dissatisfaction with its ethereal vagueness.  But that's kinda the point.  People in Japan in 1860, or today for that matter, don't generally see being gay as an identity, but as an action or series of actions.  Expecting the characters to somehow come out of the closet is a peculiarly western demand.  Ambiguity of morals, responsibility, blame, action are all pretty typical of Japanese cinema.  Like pistachio ice cream, it's not the flavor for everyone.  Other reviews complain that Matsuda Ryuhei's looks are more bizarre than beautiful.  Once again, he looks Japanese.  Zhang Ziyi in Memoirs of a Geisha is not what real Japanese people, let alone idealized 19th century ones, look like.  This film really explores perversity.  Not because of a bit of semi-graphic sodomy, but because almost everyone in the film loses their moral compass over a pretty face.  What makes it titillatingly icky is the fact that Matsuda Ryuhei was only 15 when this was filmed.",1163808000,12,1132,4.957446808510638
1723253,2,B0000687F5,"Taboo (Nagisa Oshima, 1999)

It's Japan, in 1856. Samurai are on their way out. Japan is going through changes. But the Shinsengumi Samurai Militia are still attempting to uphold tradition. Things go reasonably well until Sozaburo Kano (Izo's Ryuhei Matsuda in his film debut), an immensely talented fighter who also happens to be as beautiful as a geisha, is invited to join the militia. An alarming number of the samurai begin courting him, which concerns Captain Hijikata (Beat Takeshi), the militia's second in command. As if that's not annoying enough, a band of roustabouts who still hold a grudge from a battle last year are back in town attacking the militia whenever possible.

Oshima, well-known for stripping and examining social and sexual norms, does the same thing here. The problem is, it's pretty much all he does; the film's plot is coherent at best, and it's not often at its best. While most of the actors here give decent performances, they can only work with what they've got, and Beat Takeshi's closing monologue may be the least satisfying thing I've ever seen him do. When the big subplot surfaces, Oshima could have run with it and turned this into a great psycho-sexual serial killer film, but it's almost as if Oshima (or the editor of the film, depending) saw the big mystery as incidental at best, and left huge parts of it on the cutting-room floor. Everything moves towards the big climax... and the big climax never comes. We just get Takeshi's closing statements (and, to be fair, a beautiful closing shot).

A very pretty film, but an unsatisfying one. **",1153267200,6,1589,4.856088560885609
1723254,5,B0000687F5,"Ah, the joys of watching a really good movie.  I saw this on DVD a couple of years ago, and I was really impressed.  It has everything one could want in a samauri picture.  Beheadings, sword fights, sake drinking and sex.  Of course, not the type of sex that most americans would be able to picture amongst Samauri, but then it is/was a different culture than our own.  The movie is beautifully photographed,  the lead is just stunning to look at, and the whole story is fascinating.

All-in-all, a great film.

1723255,4,B0000687F5,"The year 1865 was a time of transition for Japan.  The Tokugawa Shogunate would collapse in two years time and the Meiji Restoration, where the emperor would be restored to his full glory was a year after that.  Yet political struggles and fighting between those loyal to the shogun and those loyal to the emperor marked that interim period.
The black-robed Shinsengumi are a pro-shogunate, pro-isolationist police force, a kind of elite squad fighting against pro-imperialist forces in Kyoto.  They are led by Commander Kondo Isami and Captain Hijikata Toshizo.
The story revolves around Sozaburo Kano, one of two new recruits whose fighting skills impress the two leaders.  Kano seems very able even in his first assignment, the execution of someone who broke the Shinsengumi code of borrowing money, dispatching the offender in the traditional way.  Yet his effeminate looks and his hair, still in a long pony-tail as opposed to the short-cut adult style, arouse desires in certain officers in the police force, such as his fellow recruit Hyozo Tashiro and threatens the stability of the Shinsengumi.  While Kano denies that he is someone's lover, he seems to enjoy the attention he gets from the others.  Hijikata seems to think Kano and Toshiro were lovers.  He has a dojo bout against Kano, who stands up well, and against Tashiro, who is ""one notch lower than Kano.""  Yet when Kano and Tashiro fight, the former does not fight as well.  This inconsistency leads the captain to that conclusion in answer to rumours asking who Kano has taken up with.
One repeated line has the motif of ""Does he lean that way"" or ""I didn't know he leant that way"" in regards to officers suspected of desiring Kano.  There was indeed a homosexual subculture flourishing in Kyoto during the Tokugawa period and it wasn't forbidden.  In the Shinsengumi, though, it's akin to love of youthful male beauty in Roman times.
One thing that might confuse people is the repeated mention of the Ikedaya Jiken (Incident). That was a fight that took place at the Ikedaya, an inn in Kyoto, in July 1864.  Commander Kondo and some men attacked and killed eight anti-shogunate activists, arresting twenty.  The two samurai who taunt Kano while he is having a bout with Commander Inoue were suspected of being anti-shogunate activists itching for revenge.  And Satsuma and Aizu refers to domains held under sway of more moderate anti-shogunate forces who sought reconciliation with the shogunate.
Beat Takeshi (Takeshi Kitano under his acting name) is his usual understated but occasionally potent self, and he does well as Hijikata, even if real Hijikata died in his mid-thirties.  His observation that jealousy among men is a dangerous thing underscores what happens when Kano comes into their midst.  Historical accuracy is also questionable in the characterization of Commander Kondo, who like Hijikata was in his thirties when he was later captured and executed in 1868 by imperial forces.
The period detail is well captured, down to the dress and even the palanquins, as is the militaristic dojo atmosphere of the Shinsengumi. An interesting study of the attractions to youthful beauty and the jealousies it can lead to.",1061856000,58,3197,5.036053130929791
1723256,3,B0000687F5,"Feudal Japan--Leaders of the Shinsengumi militia, an indpendent ""bad cop"" faction on the government's side, watch as their two newest recruits face off in a Kendo match--a wooden sword battle during a time when swordmasters received the highest regard, the samurai period. Bearded Tashiro faces off against Sozaburo Kano, who everyone can see is easily the better swordsman. But to the surprise of many, except a few insightful higher-ups, Kano loses. Beat Takeshi's Hijikata character (one of many real Japanese personalities--the Shinsengumi stories alone could entertain you for hours) and Isami Kondo immediately understand, what is going on. The viewer doesn't, but soon will. A thoughtful, judgemental look at Sozaburo, with his boyish face and demeanor, long, smooth hair, and feminine almond-shaped eyes--got it yet?--reveals all. He lost because he may be ""involved"" with Tashiro, who may not be the only one with ""leanings"" toward Sozaburo.
It's an interesting revelation to those of us only familiar with the tough samurais of Kurosawa films or the Zatoichi blind swordsman-type TV series; that these men of the sword were also men of a different type of sword. The practice isn't uncommon in history. Gladiators (yes, those during Russell Crowe's Maximus character's time) were also prone to have homosexual leanings, as did many senators. But director Nagisa Oshima does a masterful job of the consequences of a workplace relationship in the context of samurai Japan, and a homosexual relationship at that.
Not to say that the practice is widely accepted. Hijikata even orders a sergeant to take Sozaburo to a brothel to see if he can be turned around; Sozaburo misinterprets the sergeant's friendliness. Internal strife develops as other samurais join the chase for Sozaburo; rumor gives birth to tension that ends in murders, a difficult thing to have in an organization involved in a war. This is particularly of concern to Hijikata, who serves as the narrative voice in many parts of the movie, although Sozaburo remains the protagonist.
Oshima has a flair for creating then sustaining moods, be it soft, dark and suspenseful, or symbolically poignant. The swordfights are excellent, as they should be, being that this is a samurai film. Blood and gore levels are kept a reasonably tame level for this sort of film. This film would be best viewed with some sort of knowledge of the time period; perhaps get some simple reading done, or even watch a few episodes of the Rurouni Kenshin anime series, which deals heavily with the Shinsengumi, Ishin Shishi and the Meiji restoration of this time (search for ""Samurai X"" then watch the Trust and Betrayal movies).
This is a four-star film that gets three for revealing an aspect of the samurai that many hardcore fans may not be comfortable with. It may taint your ideal of the samurai, but Oshima allows us to accept this slowly, through a beautifully--both in image and in flow--worked film. Highly recommended for viewing, and possibly recommended for your own library.",1053907200,18,3035,5.145748987854251

Must admit also to a liking for the traditional costumes (would be good fun to be a samurai warrior for a short time, but no head cutting please) & of course many of the men that well fill such costumes. To bring an end to the digression, will now talk about the film Taboo.  It is a beautiful film. Magnificent settings, good dialogue, interesting story, well told. There are many scenes that will remember for a long time, one is when the older samurai takes our hero to the parlor to be introduced to the pleasures of the feminine sex. Kano takes the hand of the older samurai in such a sweet way, particularly considering how well that those same hands so easily cut off heads.

7963976,3,B0000687F5,"I enjoyed this movie more than my 3* rating suggests. The elegant portrayal of the stringently disciplined, tough environment of a 19th century samurai dojo is deceptive. Beneath the surface of this  ritualistic environment, seething passions roil. This movie has to contain one of the most beautiful people I've seen. Ryhei Matsuda as the young samurai Sozaburo Kano is exquisitely beautiful and this makes the jealousies and competitiveness he arouses in the souls of some of his fellow samurais believable. Matsuda's acting skills are superb: he perfectly captures the chilling lust for power and killing in the young samurai, all the more shocking because he is the passive partner in his homosexual liaisons. The costumes and settings, the dazzling swordfights and the tightly contained passions breaking loose add up to an engrossing film.

Why then the 3* rating? The English sub-titles were poor. They were small and were displayed in a flash, too often leaving me (a fast reader) only only half-read the words. Whether it was becase I missed clues given in the too-fast sub-titles, or because I don't have a deep enough knowledge of the historical period to fully appreciate nuances and customs, there were times when some of the plot twists were a bit obscure for my taste.

But this movie is worth seeing for the acting alone; whether restrained or unfettered, the fraught emotions of all the samurai were palpable and leapt off the screen.",1303257600,2,1451,5.062761506276151

(Japan/France/UK - 1999)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS

1865: A beautiful young male warrior (Ryohei Matsuda) causes jealousy and resentment amongst the members of a samurai garrison, leading to conflict and murder.

Nagisa Oshima courted controversy with this unusual drama, which dares to foreground the homoerotic underpinnings of chanbara swordplay epics. Takeshi Kitano headlines proceedings as an experienced militia leader who fears Matsuda's influence on the men in his command, despite the boy's obvious fighting prowess. However, some viewers may be disconcerted by Matsuda's overtly feminised appearance, which makes him look odd rather than beautiful, undermining the film's entire premise. In fact, Matsuda is upstaged in this regard by actor/musician Shinji Takeda (PULSE), playing an equally beautiful fellow warrior whose smile and enthusiasm lights up the entire garrison, prompting a violent sequence of events during the narrative's latter stages.

Though the film's 'gay' element is presented matter-of-factly, Oshima also highlights a measure of prejudice amongst Matsuda's fellow soldiers, with devastating consequences for many of the leading characters. Staged and photographed with formal grace (a typical chanbara conceit), Oshima's busy screenplay - co-written with Ryotaro Shiba, derived from fact-based literary works - moves swiftly from sex-drama to murder-mystery with lightning efficiency, and the climactic twist is genuinely surprising.",1256688000,4,1523,6.131455399061033
