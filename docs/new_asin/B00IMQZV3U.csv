6281832,5,B00IMQZV3U,Loved the series. But I had a problems wth the season 1 cds freezing upand not playing.,1404864000,2,87,4.176470588235294
6281833,3,B00IMQZV3U,My opinion is when you advertise  a complete series of a show you should not put in the fine print that several episodes are missing and that these are rerecorded with copyright permission  My fault for not reading the whole ad I guess.

The first episode of season 2, introducing Rachel and Noah and explaining the departure of Emma and Sam, is not included so the entire season opens nonsensically.

6281838,5,B00IMQZV3U,"I love the series overall and waited patiently for years for it to come out completely. Seasons 2 & 3 came out many years after Season 1.  However, I am very disappointed in the fact that some episodes were actually missing and one episode--A Tiger's Tale-- was repeated twice on Season 3 (both on disc 3 and disc 4).  MGM ( or whomever is responsible for putting out this home DVD series) screwed us in that regard.  I heard that 4 episodes were actually missing.  Maybe they will put those out on an additional DVD. ( But most likely not).",1515196800,2,541,4.38

I did not expect to be missing episodes from 3. I hope at some point that it will be corrected in the future because I would love to see season 3 in its entire and correct order.

Season 3 IS advertised as ""complete""; however, my set is MISSING Ep 14 Shadowmen. Instead, I have a repeat of Ep 10 A Tiger's Tale.  Also, Ep 16 Dark Brother & Ep 15 Mask of Fear are switched in order of original showing.  ALL of these missing episodes (as well as the entire series save one ep, I believe) may be found on YouTube.com.  Search ""young riders Season _ ep_ (whichever season and/or ep you want).

Season 3: Three episodes missing (The Blood of Others, Between Rock Creek and a Hard Place, and Shadowmen).

I found it at our local library and as it became one of my favorite series, I just had to add it to my large DVD collection.  I was pleasantly surprised when I was able to purchase the ENTIRE series for an incredibly low price from Amazon.
