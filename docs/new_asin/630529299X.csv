1010096,5,630529299X,"this movie is so good! I saw it 2 days ago and have watched it 5 times since then. The story is adorable and the cast is fantastic! they play their parts with all the conviction of real life. Alexis Arquette and  Christian Maelen's performances are fabulous and well worth seeing. I  encourage to see this movie if you in the mood for a good laugh, some good  fun, and a little love!",951436800,8,383,4.219178082191781
1010097,5,630529299X,"I first saw this movie and was a little uncomfortable about the homesexual view point, but after the second time of seeing it, I fell in love. It doesn't matter if you're straight or not, it is the sweetest movie that  makes you walk away feel good about love!",949968000,3,260,4.3061224489795915
1010098,2,630529299X,"There's nothing in here that would be very interesting if it weren't for the whole gay angle. Alexis Arquette looks a little too caveman-like (the sloping forehead, the lazy jaw) to be the object of so much affection. The  only one in the entire movie who seemed really gay to me was the groom! But  despite all those negatives, I would still see it again for the performance  of Christian Maelen. What is he doing lately?",947030400,3,422,4.526315789473684
1010099,5,630529299X,"The film is a brilliant effort by Brian Sloan: rarely has there been such a mixture between over-the-top fun, and reality. It pits you in a quasi real world of the characters, all played brilliantly by the cast.  Especially worth noting is Tuc Watkins: his efforts were universally  praised.
For those who can't afford the rental price of the video should  probably try and purchase the British DVD version of the film (Region 2).",943660800,4,430,4.783783783783784

Brandons coming out was the best thing i've seen in a  long time. I laughed and cried all the way through the film. Hope it's not  too long before we see part 2.

1010101,4,630529299X,"Over the summer, the two fluffiest films I saw were this and Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss.  In this case they got it right.  The jokes are funny (especially the few in-jokes for DC area residents), the situations  absurd, and the romance at the center truly touching.  The  ""hunky"" actor playing the hearthob is gorgeous (just what you  want for fluff) and the rest of the cast interacts wonderfully.  It will  remind you of 40's romantic comedy, only here the gay content is center  stage and not coded.  As a college age gay male getting pretty tired of  seeing 101 straight romantic comedies come out every year, this was a  perfect antidote.  A really nice gay flick.",917308800,2,672,4.689655172413793

1010229,5,630529299X,"I put off watching this on Prime for a long time.  I figured since it was a late-90's gay comedy, it would be overly cheesy and awful to watch.

It's nice to be surprised.  It was charming.  The comedy wasn't too broad.  It had heart.  It's wasn't overly melodramatic.

It was a much better film than I expected.  It was funny without being cloying.  It's a good story told by a good cast, particularly Arquette.",1392336000,3,412,4.386666666666667

1010231,5,630529299X,I have always enjoyed this movie.  Classic fantasy; classic romance.  I enjoyed the actors.  Always regretted there was not a followup -- you know that relationship is not going to be easy.,1388534400,2,189,4.84375
1010232,5,630529299X,"I first watched this movie seven months ago, hated it, and wrote a scathing one-star review review. Recently I saw its trailer with another movie and wanted to see it, having completely forgotten in the intervening months that I'd seen it before. This time I LOVED it! Go figure. I guess it proves that sometimes first impressions are wrong.

The story could be clichd and predictable but isn't (I really love the satisfying and perfectly executed double-twist at the end); the characters could be tired stereotypes but aren't; the dialog could be as dumb as it is in most movies, but it is fresh, smart and completely believable; the ""my straight crush turns out to be gay and loves me"" fantasy could be infuriating (why I hated it before) but isn't, really, after all.

Alexis Arquette is charming in the lead, Chris Maelen is every bit as marvelous as everybody else says he is, and the chemistry between them is real. (I've given up wondering why gorgeous, fantastic actors like Maelen don't go on to stardom, but he's probably better off. Arquette looks better and is obviously happier as a woman, but I'm very glad he made this and Grief - his two best performances - while he could still play male characters.)

This movie's only faults are five extremely irritating minor characters: a priest, a stoner dude named Eric, and Carol's neurotic mother, slutty sister and ditzy aunt. They're negligible, though, because everything else about this movie is fantastic.

(The seven people who've voted this review ""Not Helpful"" so far (really meaning they don't agree with it) did so before I pulled this 180 switch.)",1383955200,2,1617,4.8478260869565215

1010324,4,630529299X,"So, this movie was made before Alexis Arquette had transitioned from male to female.  It is astonishing to see her back when she was a handsome, masculine dude named Robert.  Masculine, now, not butch.  I saw this movie back in the 1990s, forgot about it, and rented the other day.  It has held up surprising well.  The wonderful Lauren Velez and Tuc Watkins turn in great comedic performances. And Alexis is lovable as the neurotic, slightly nebbishy gay boy who has a crush on his allegedly straight roommate.  Fun footnote: I lived in Washington, DC, when this film was made, and where it was set.  The movie captures accurately the look and feel of Georgetown during the William Jefferson Clinton epoch.",1355961600,,707,4.793388429752066

1010326,2,630529299X,"""I Think I Do"" is fairly awful, which makes me wonder about the authenticity of these online reviews. The biggest problem is the casting. First off, I could never imagine the straight couple ever getting married. No onscreen chemistry whatsoever.  The same could be said of the 3 leads in the gay triangle. No chemistry. Alexis Arquette, as Bob, isn't even believable as the object of affection of Christian Maelin (as Brendan) and T.C. Watkins (as Sterling). It's a quantum leap for me to believe that Brendan or Sterling would ever be hung-up on Bob. And as an actor/actress, Arquette over-acts and doesn't have a natural acting prowess like Maelin or Watkins. We already knew that T.C. Watkins can act. The true relevation is the acting ability of Christian Maelin as Brendan. He's extremely good. But even Maelin and Watkins can't save a story/script that is dreadfully slow and boring. The whole movie seemed like a long party scene with not much happening. I was bored.",1353196800,,975,4.873493975903615

(They were dancing in Trax, a favorite club of mine in the 1990's!) Plus Lauren Velez (Dexter) was in it and not playing a witch, which was cool for a change.",1327536000,,450,4.433734939759036

1010392,1,630529299X,"I watched this movie and it had the genre of a gay movie. I think this movie should of had a better script. I think this movie is over priced even at fifty cents for 24 hours. This is not how to make a gay movie. I expected to see more personal, intimate interactions between the men and less of a movie about someone getting married. If you are going to make a gay movie, then make a gay movie. Don't just skirt the edges of what you can get away with and try to make it for everyone to see. In my opinion this movie is an absolute joke. The only people that really benefited from this movie production were all the hired people behind the scenes.",1324684800,2,648,4.0703125
1010393,3,630529299X,"The director mentioned in his interview 'The Philadelphia Story', as does the DVD sleeve which thinks this a charming update. No Way!

For the first half I had trouble working out who was who, and not really caring. Yes, clearly Bob had hots for Brendan or possibly the other way around; or both. Characterisation was minimal (also, as often the case, no 'student' was believable as a student, the actors clearly being mid-20s, and not aged 19 or 20), apart from the lead character looking doleful a lot, mainly because he lacked the gumption to come out with his feelings for his room-mate.

I found the sound quality strange; even with the volume up, I couldn't always make out what they were all saying. Was the sound recordist over-dependant on a boom microphone? Did I miss anything - not a lot.

It was only when we got to ""Five Years Later"" that the sound became clearer and the characters started to be characters - not believable, mind you, because they were acting, the actors thought, in a 'screwball' comedy or so the director believed.

I was fairly sure Bob would end in the arms of Brendan, and the totally wooden Stirling would have to find his own fan club elsewhere. Did I care about the other couplings - not a lot. Two characters spoked a spliff or several. The bride seemed partial to valium or was it prozac, and hammed her way through being drug-sober and drug-dopey; the groom, too ugly to be interesting.

Plus points : Alexis Arquette did not look like a film star (apart, frighteningly, at times looking like an adult Macauley Caulkin (all teeth)), which actually made his role more believable than the glossy hair-do Hollywood soap types (of whom the least credible was Tuc Watkins, over whom an amazing number of reviewers drool, quite why I cannot think as he was totally unbelievable as a gay man, at least those I've met). Arquette had a certain pathos in his patheticness (which I suppose if the definition of pathos). Christian Maelen - the only actor with potential star quality -  had a dreamy quality to his eyes - keep taking the drops - and was always perfectly smooth-shaven and glossily hair-brushed.

The director in his interview reported that - I paraphrase - some casting was done not in castings but as a result of getting stand-ins to help with script readings. I can believe that.

Overall verdict - screwball comedy is hard work to create, and I'm far from convinced the director and cast were remotely up to it; it definitely isn't slapstick, of which there were several moments in the film. There were moments when I smiled, but none where I tittered and definitely none where I laughed. Lucky to get 3 stars in my view.",1304380800,3,2671,4.656050955414012

1010395,5,630529299X,"With its great subtitle (""One Wedding, No Funerals""), I THINK I DO succeeds fabulously where so many similar movies fail. Here we see humans who honor the tenets of friendship; we see those of both sexual persuasions who honestly know honest love and friendship when they see it, who know how to give and accept that kind of love and affection. And we see individuals who keep sex in perspective even as they thoroughly enjoy it.

This is a fun movie about decent people who come alive displaying all the faults with which decent people are usually endowed and for which they earn our forbearance, forgiveness and respect because most of us - even with our foibles - are decently human ourselves.

One knows almost from the beginning how this movie should conclude and with whom the Alexis Arquette character belongs. But even with its foreshadowing, it's a joy to watch him* (as well as the other characters) navigate largely unfamiliar waters of love and romance in the 90s. Indeed, given the Arquette character's two possible choices, the alternate decision would have been only slightly less satisfying.

I give this film the full 5 stars.

1010397,4,630529299X,"""I Think I Do"" is very much an ""of the moment"" movie that sums up the zeitgeist of the 1990s for the LGBT community.  The story starts in the 1980s as we get the familiar tale of two college buddies (Alexis Arquette and Christian Maelen) who are roommates and who quite subtly have the hots for each other.  While clearly shot on the cheap in Washington D.C. the film has an other-worldly real/unreal feel to it.  The script and the actors have the requisite ""independent"" feel that alternately feels excessive and languid, which hinders things a bit.  We don't really learn the characters names or motivations until we reach the flashback stage; before then they're just not fully fleshed out or articulated.  We only know that Bob wants Brendan, but his affections are unrequited.

Flash forward six years and it's the marriage of Carol and Matt (Carol played by the delightful Lauren Vlez, better known as Lt. LaGuerta on the series ""Dexter"") and the old gang is invited to attend.  All have moved on with their lives and it's in the portion where ""I Think I Do"" finally hits its stride.  And while most have moved on with their lives not everyone has, culminating in Bob being torn between his involvement with his soap actor boyfriend Sterling and his unrequited love Brendan.  The film resolves itself in ways predictable and unexpected, lending a ""seen-it-all-before"" quality to the proceedings.  That's not to say it's a clichd or trite movie, but it's hardly breaking new ground here.  I enjoyed it and there are far worse movies out there to see.  If you want something light and unchallenging then ""I Think I Do"" is just for you!",1267056000,3,1640,4.735915492957746
1010447,5,630529299X,"I was not sure why I love this movie so much; after seeing it once on Logo I had to own it.  Like others I have watched it over and over and still love it!  It is definitely romantic fluff, not really Academy Award material, but so much of the Oscars is heavy drama or sad or depressing.  Not this movie--it is fun and light-hearted, but will tug at your heart strings, too!  I agree with the reviewers that said this movie stays with you, and I think it is because it reminds me of my college days.  The reviewers that praised the script and the acting are correct--they are great (again, not Oscar material, but you should not be expecting that from a romantic comedy)!  These characters are truly believeable--exactly what college-aged kids navigating romance and partying are like, and they captured what life a few years after college is like perfectly--navigating new jobs and relationships while secretly holding on to old flames and hoping for one more chance at a missed opportunity.  The whole cast is great and the seamless integration between the gay and straight story lines is so refreshing (no dramatic cliches like HIV or addiction to bring the fun down [although chain smoking abounds--but it effectively adds to the humor] and no over the top stereotypes like nelly queens to distract, annoy, or offend)!  A lot of the humor is somewhat subtle (no in-your-face toilet humor) and a lot is said in the facial expressions.  I think I had to watch the movie more than once to realize how much is conveyed by body language.  For instance, I felt like a scene was missing in the end when Bob makes his choice between guys (I tend to like things very literal and up front), but upon repeat viewings, the missing dialogue is captured in Sterling's face as he watches Bob and Brandon across the train station.  The same is true for the relationship between the couple getting married--the love between them that is not evident in the dialogue is captured in their faces and body language.  Whoever complained that the characters did not take their relationships seriously may have had a very different experience in their early to mid 20s than these characters--they are trying to make sense of their feelings and relationships and this is the best they come up with.  I thought it very true to life, which is why I loved this movie and why it stays with me--it was a very realistic, funny, and poignant snapshot of life for a bunch of 20-somethings, gay and straight, that still resonated with me (a 30-something) even though I am at such a different place in my life.  If you are a romantic at heart, I think you will love this movie. If your expectations are too high, you will be disappointed, but I think the rule for romantic comedies is that your expectations should come down a few notches from Oscar-worthy material. I hope Logo shows this as often as they do some of their other programs!",1167782400,4,2907,4.63035019455253
1010448,3,630529299X,"Didn't satisfy my expectations, that is.  They just underperformed in the execution of this story.  I won't go so far as to call it 'bad', but it clearly could have been better.

Don't expect much going in, and then you may be pleasantly surprised.  I'd certainly watch this again before I'd suffer through some lesser titles.

For a story that purports to be about love, there's a paucity of luvin displayed here.  In fact, I don't remember any, and I just saw this four hours ago.  It certainly isn't a ""date"" movie, due to the lack of action.  Nobody ""closes the deal"".

Overall, I will say it's fairly good, or ""okay"".",1140825600,2,622,4.531531531531532
1010449,4,630529299X,"I was very surprised by the level of humor, wit, charm, and simplicity surrounding the film I Think I Do.  I was expecting to see another low-budget independent film about homosexuality similar to what I witnessed in Go Fish, you know, the graininess of the scenes, the clich homosexual characters coupled with humor that would be more political than funny, but I was wrong.  I must admit, I Think I Do was extremely stage-ish and not overly original, but what captured my attention throughout the film was the level of respect that the friends had for each other.  This was not a film that carried any hatred, or insecurities, or racism towards our main characters, but instead centered itself on the power of friends.  I think that is why I had such a big smile on my face as I watched this film.  Sure, on the surface it was about a gay man's struggle to decide between the man he has loved for many years or the long-term relationship he has already developed.  Yet, for me, there was so much more.  I would have to say that friendship was the central theme of this film, and director Brian Sloan realized this and used it to his advantage.  Instead creating this clich pro-homosexuality film, Sloan just created a movie.  As you watch the characters develop, you forget that this is a gay film, but instead feels just like a typical modern romance that you would pay to see in theaters.  I hate to use the word average, but for I Think I Do, it is not a bad thing.  This was an average movie, and because of the average nature of the themes, characters, and emotions, I Think I Do is better than any romantic comedy that Hollywood could create.

With independent films you sometimes run into the problem of having too many hands in the cookie jar.  By this I mean, too many characters and not having enough time to develop the emotions behind them all.  Brian Sloan overcame this typical hurdle and produced a film that gives each of our eight characters a chance to breathe and live on screen.  As I think back to this film, I do not know of one character that I could say I didn't know anything about.  It is rare in cinema, because so often directors focus most of the attention on their two centralized characters that the minor players fall to the wayside.  This is not the case in I Think I Do.  Everyone is developed, shockingly, and everyone is their own unique personality.  Sloan made sure that the eight different players didn't suddenly end up like each other.  With these types of films, especially in Go Fish, everyone was the same.  You had characters that were supposed to be different, but talked and walked exactly the same.  It is as if a gay man can only be played one way.  This film proves different.  I thought that the entire Sterling Scott backstory was hysterical.  Here you have this mediocre soap opera star that has this HUGE gay fan base.  For me, I found this so funny.  Each time he went out in public, he was swarmed by gay men wanting his autograph because they loved his ""hospital"" scenes that Bob had wrote.  Sterling was by far my favorite character because he could have been one to dapper the entire film, but instead he continued to keep it light and bubbly.  It was good to finally have ""fun"" characters, watching them have fun, and seeing this over-played story develop in a new way.  Again, I Think I Do was not original, but it was fun.

The music in this film played a huge part in creating the tone of the film.  Instead of playing these clich gay music, Sloan took contemporary tunes and placed them in the background.  These songs completely lightened the mood and created the essence of a comedy.  There weren't any dark, dreary moments to this film, you knew what was going to happen from the beginning, the only obstacle to overcome would be how Sloan was going to handle it.  I must admit, he did a great job.  Sloan's camera work isn't the greatest, his direction isn't as tight, but that isn't the reason for this film.  Love, friendship, and the classic tale of a missed college romance is the center of this film and Sloan keeps that in our face.  I have to applaud his dedication to these themes.  He didn't go political, he didn't try to make a huge statement about the gay community, he just made a movie.  This may be hard for me to explain, but I loved watching the ""standard"" wedding take place in the backdrop of this bigger romance.  I think Sloan placed our characters in the best positions for the best humor.  I just think I liked this film because it wasn't pushing pro-gay in my face, it was just demonstrating true love in our modern world.  I am surprised this film isn't shown more because of the unbiased images it shows.

Again, I would like to restate that this was not a perfect film.  Was it a play prior to being captured on film?  While the answer may be ""no"", it did have a stage-like aura to it.  The actors seemed to pause after each of their jokes, and my only change would be to speed up the pacing of the humor.  It was funny, don't get me wrong, but the overall feeling of the film could have been tightened to create a perfect moment of gay cinema.  Finally, Sloan had the ability to build more into his story.  He made it so simple that more lines could have been crossed, and I secretly wished they would have.  I wanted to see more between Beth and Eric, and even more closure with Sarah, but I was satisfied.  This was a great film.  Funny, witty, charming ... you know, all those elements that seem to be missing whenever Hollywood taps its magic wand.  The story was unoriginal, but the themes will just grab at you and make you happy to live in a culture that will soon accept this type of lifestyle.

I was a little iffy on it the first time.  There is almost too much going on (and too quickly) to keep up with.  This is not a movie to watch while you are doing something else (like being on the computer or talking with a friend.)  But the second time, I get all the humor and inside jokes and am watching the facial expressions more closely.  There is a lot here to see, and it's all pretty insightful and funny.

The remakes and placement of Partridge Family songs cannot be missed.  They're wonderful.

The soundtrack on the commentary is off from the movie, as others have mentioned.  It's safe to say the DVDs have this flaw and it's not just a couple bad DVDs. It's annoying, but not unwatchable.

A wedding seems to be fodder for a lot of movies, and this one makes good use of every opportunity.  I may have to purchase this film.  Recommended for lots of fun and a couple good belly laughs.",1116806400,5,1056,4.299492385786802
1010453,4,630529299X,"I loved this movie when I first saw it in the theater and was thrilled when it was finally released on DVD.  It's a cute, screwball romantic comedy that actually gets funnier as it goes along - most comedies these days seem to lose their momentum as they head toward the conclusion.  Some good, funny performances and a happy ending make it worth a look.

My only complaint is with the DVD.  First, the movie is not widescreen.  This isn't a huge deal for this movie since it's character driven and the cinematography isn't the main draw.  Still if a widescreen print were available it would have been nice to use it.

The main problem I have is with the director/cast commentary.  I haven't even been able to get through it because the audio is not synched up with the movie.  The film soundtrack is fine when you watch the movie by itself, but during the commentary it's off by about 2 seconds.  Maybe this won't bother other people but I got a headache trying to watch and listen.  I wrote Strand Releasing who put out the DVD about the problem but never got a response.  I haven't seen this problem mentioned here so maybe I have a defective copy.  But be aware of the possiblity before you buy the DVD.

So, 5 stars for the movie but it loses one for DVD problems.  BTW, it looks like the DVD may be going out of print (Strand only lists the VHS as available on their website) so grab a copy while you can.",1110844800,4,1411,4.311787072243346

1010455,5,630529299X,"I originally saw this movie in the theatre and have both the VHS and DVD. As many times as I have watched this flick, I have never gotten tired of it. The film makes me laugh and cry as much the 100th time as it did on my first viewing. If Brian Sloan can do this incredible a production on this lower-budgeted film, I can't wait to see what he can create when the ""bank vaults are open."" Mr. Sloan stated a very perceptive insight about the making of this film. If I can paraphrase a bit it is that gay and straight people cannot be seperated. They are intertwined together in our society.
The film introduces us to a group of college friends (gay, straight, and closeted) during their senior year at Georgetown University and then jump-forwards five years later to their reunion at one of the couple's wedding. The plot is already described in many of the reviews on line already. Suffice to say the interwoven themes are about unrequited love, friendship, loyalty, honestly, and finding one's self-idenity and place in the word. The casting- PERFECT!- from the six main characters to all the supporting actors and actresses in this movie. The chemistry created by this ensemble is rarely matched or equaled in films today.
My two favorite characters in the film? Carol and Brendan. Carol, the bride, gets all the good lines! Her facial and body language in her delivery only adds to my enjoyment and laughter. Brendan delivers one of the consistent and enjoyable roles from making me laugh to making me cry. The final scene with Brendan (and Bob) at the train station has me in tears everytime. Bravo Christian and Lauren!
The script is border-line genius in so many of the lines- serious and funny. To top it all off is having the Partridge Family songs, which at times almost seem like they were made for this movie, pop in and out during the film.
This film is why we all go to the movies... to laugh, have fun, and maybe walk away a better person having taken away a lesson(s) about life philosophies. A VERY enjoyable film from beginning to end that won't disappoint. I promise!",1065657600,31,2086,4.595174262734584

1010486,5,630529299X,"In the following review, I'm not going to tell the plot of this wonderful, warm movie because almost everyone else on this board has told highlights of the plot.  However I'm going to tell you what this fillm means to me on a personal level.
This is one of my all time favorite movies.  It is a movie I view when I'm happy, when I'm sad, when I'm depressed, when I'm discontented,, when I'm contented when I'm grumpy, when I'm feeling older than god, etc.--in other words, no matter what state of mind I'm in, this movie makes me feel better, happier and yes, even younger. (By the way, I'm a whole lot older than the characters in the movie.) I really can't say how many time I've viewed ""I Think I Do"" it must be, going on, at least, a hundred times.  I love all of the characters.  It's just an integral part of my life.  In the course of a day, I'm forever thinking of some line from the film that I particularly like and find amusing (e.g., ""Advil and sleep"" ""Oh Bob, I'm scared, you've been writing for that soap-opera too long"" ""So making out in the bathroom is what you call romantic? It would've been if you hadn't been moving around so much"" ""your ex-father will arrive at..."" ""Whatever you say, pokey-bear"" etc. You'll have to see the movie to be able to relate and find out what context those quotes are in, and I'm sure you'll find your own funny lines to remember.
I highly recommend this movie to anyone that wants a little romance, warmth and/or fantasy in his/her life (or just to feel good) by getting acquainted with a lovable group of wonderful friends where gay and straight get along and care about each other no matter what his/her respective sexual orientation happens to be.  To me the group of characters in ""I Think I Do"" are every bit as funny (if not funnier) as the characters on the television sit-com ""Friends""; however, the characters in the film are far more diverse--ethnically and sexually.  One thing for sure, they handle the gay issue far better than the television group does.  No one is ""put-down"" for being gay or appearing to be gay--no cheap shots at gay people.
Each actor is wonderful in his or her role being far funnier and likeable than any of the actors in the above-mentioned sit-com.  The stand-out is Guilermo Diaz (he also starred in ""Stonewall"") as Eric.  The actress that plays Beth is also one of my favorites.  Frankly, I like them all!! I just wish, in my youth, I had a group of friends like those portrayed in this movie.  Maybe I'm reliving my youth a little (or at least a fantasy thereof), by repeated viewings of this film.
The critics felt this movie was a 1990's version of a 1930's slapstick romantic comedy where ""boy gets girl""; however, in this movie ""boy gets boy"".  The gay romance is interwoven seamlessly into the fabric of the film occurring at the same time as a heterosexual wedding.  It makes for a wonderful, delightful fun-filled romp of fun and laughter.",1035504000,51,2936,4.504708097928437
1010487,5,630529299X,"Not really a gay film, I think - though there's much to appeal to us there. Above all things this is a romantic comedy of the intelligent kind, filled with superbly fun dialogue and purpose-filled retro soundtrack. The cast was a very agreeable surprise to me - they are all so good! (and Powers That Be - so unused in mainstream projects)
Definitely a feel-good movie & most certainly a major one ever to be made out of minor-to-medium resources.

1010488,5,630529299X,"In ""I Think I Do,"" a group of college friends (Bob, Brendan, Eric, Beth, Sarah, Matt and Carol) reunites a few years after graduation to celebrate the wedding of two members of the group, Matt and Carol. But complications abound:

1) Matt and Carol aren't getting along so well.
2) Beth, who has long lusted for Eric, may be hoping for a second shot, but Eric doesn't seem to be interested.
3) Sarah, who pursued Brendan back in college, would like to close the deal this time.
4) Bob, who also pursued Brendan with disastrous results, is trying to figure out how serious a relationship he wants with current boyfriend, soap star Sterling, AND is nervous about seeing Brendan again.
5) And Brendan....well, who knows what Brendan wants?

And thus the fun begins. Unlike way too many low-budget gay films, director Brian Sloan's ""I Think I Do"" is well-written, acted and directed. I was especially impressed with the pacing. No pointless lingering or extended arty moments here! The characters interact and/or react, and we're on to the next scene, wanting more. A tip: watch the film a second time. You'll pick up more with a repeat viewing.

So here's the bottom line: if your idea of fun is a clever, well-paced gay romantic comedy--and you don't mind the occasional minor technical distractions of a fairly low-budget film (occasional awful lighting, an extra who shows up in two places at once)-then definitely check out ""I Think I Do.""

Flashforward 5 years as they and their old school friends reunite for a wedding and the sexual hijinx start to fly!

The film starts out with the main character, Bob, and his blatant crush on his college roommate  Brendan.  Several years later he's in an almost too comfortable relationship with the hunky soap opera star he writes for when he's reunited with Brendan at a wedding.  In the intervening years -  Brendan has realized he's gay and in love with Bob.  But he isn't sure about how to tell Bob about his feelings or what to do about the soap opera boyfriend, Sterling.  Add  the drama and comedy of old friends reuniting and the who do I really love and you have a wonderful and funny little film.
The writing is crisp and sharp and direction is well done too.  The music is fantastic and centers around the classic sappy pop tunes of the Partridge Family (that we all love but almost no one admits to).

But Bob is in a long-term relationship with Sterling--a soap opera star in the soap that Bob writes for.
There are a lot of other sub-plots going on and they are a little annoying because I wish they had just concentrated on the love triangle between Bob-Sterling-and Brendan.

Beth and Eric are another of the subplots--they lusted after each other in college but for some reason never got it together. They each meet one night stands at the reception for the wedding, yet it is still clear that they are lusting after each other. Matt and Carol are the ones getting married-they have been together ever since college-and their relationship is very tenuous.

1010524,4,630529299X,"A cute romantic comedy set around a wedding reunion of college roommates, where old crushes and frustrations are awakened.  While formulaed, I found myself chuckling with the good timing of the curves.  Like modern video,  you must believe that everyone but kooky relatives have near-model looks.  One well acted sensitive scene near the end brought a tear and a smile.",951609600,3,369,5.1
7887708,5,630529299X,Love this movie! Had to replace my rental copy after watching it so many times. Love the Partridge Family music and the characters are generally well written. Seems more like a College Film class project but definitely has some polish and lots of moxie.,1524614400,,253,4.7727272727272725
7887709,4,630529299X,"Not the regular romance - this followed the romances and relationships of 3 sisters.  Some humdrum moments, some emotional moments, but the last 8 minutes (time includes the credits) was VERY satisfying and energized.",1513468800,,217,5.382352941176471
7887710,5,630529299X,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. Some of the acting is, well not great, but I think it adds to the charm of movie. Some of the actors when on to do other great projects. Each of the character reminds me of someone I went to college with. They start as college kids. What I love about this movie is that we all had a crush on the one unattainable guy. Some may have connected, while other may only have the memory of what almost happened.

Anyway, I thought this movie captured the time period perfectly. The sound track was surprisingly perfectly choosen. I had long forgot The Partridge Family and after  watching I immediately downloaded it from iTunes.

Christian Maelen, if you reading this, call me :) Im single. and you are adorable. I wish the video quality was better, a bleary version would definitely be a must buy for me.",1511049600,,843,4.425806451612903
7887711,3,630529299X,"The rental price on this was $4.99, which is quite high for an older movie. I was disappointed in this film. The video quality was very grainy and low res and the production values are low budget. I also didn't like the actor who played Joe, which made it hard to sympathize with his plight, and he's the main character. This was billed as a ""screwball comedy"" but it was more like a low budget, whiny version of The Breakfast Club. Not recommended.",1510704000,,449,4.421686746987952
