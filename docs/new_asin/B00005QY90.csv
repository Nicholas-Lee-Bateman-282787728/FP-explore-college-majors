Long Story Short I Loves Satans School For Girls & Silent Night Bloody Night.  I Didnt Much Care For The House On Haunted Hill, And I Would Like To See More Special Features For The Films.
Overall The DVD Is Fine",1297382400,,291,4.017241379310345
7951469,2,B00005QY90,"Silent night bloody night was poor in sound and video. Watchable but not all that good. Rating: C-
Satan's school for girls was the best produced of the bunch with decent acting by a very young Kate Jackson and Cheryl Ladd of Charlie's
Angels. Sometimes the film has blemishes but mostly a good video transfer. I would purchase this one on its own as I like the genre. It is a true B movie.
Don't look in the basement is absurd. I read some good reviews for this movie but don't understand why. It is very low budget, very campy, and the actors are substandard. I am not trying to be funny, but I think the only way to enjoy this movie is if you are very high or if you saw this movie as a kid and it brings back memories. Otherwise, a waste of time. I would rate it D-.
Finally, House on Haunted Hill is a classic with Vincent Price. Not one of my favorites and the remake was alot better, but nevertheless this one has its fans. I suppose I would rate it  C+.
Overall, I would not purchase this set again. However,I did enjoy Satan's School for Girls and will probably purchase it on its own. This 4 movie set will sit on my ""file away"" shelf. Hope this review helps.",1197763200,2,1169,4.172566371681416
7951470,4,B00005QY90,"Future CHARLIE'S ANGELS Kate Jackson and Cheryl Ladd appeared together over a decade earlier in the made-for-tv movie ""Satan's School For Girls,"" which is featured in the EVIL PLACE 4 MOVIE pack. There's lots more chillingly dark fun to be had here, so do enjoy!

7951471,4,B00005QY90,"This is a really good 4 pak.  No problems, I would not Highly recommend it but I would strongly recommend it.

Silent Night Bloody Night- I also have this movie on a single DVD pak, I like it plus it has John ""The Sentinel"" Carridine in it.

Don't Look in the Basement- Like J. Autrey ""jimmyplm""  said, worth the price of the 4 pak alone

Satan School for Girls-My kind of movie I compare it with The Initiation of Sarah, and another impossible to find movie Midnight Offerings about these two highschool witches one Evil Robin and one Good Sarah, I believe the names are correct.  If anyone can tell me where I could find this rare film Midnight Offerings not to be confused with Burnt Offerings with Karen Black and Oliver Reed another great film, anyway I would be grateful.  Btw in Satan School for Girls get a good look at those White shoes the ""Stud"" Teacher is wearing.

House on Haunted Hill-It has Vincent Price and Elijah Cook, need I say more.  Plus it is very funny",1135555200,2,977,4.41340782122905
7951472,4,B00005QY90,"this set is great for Don't Look in the Basement and/or House on Haunted Hill alone but WAIT you get both AND a couple of low budget knock-offs.  For a b-movie buff, these are awesome!",1104624000,3,184,4.257142857142857
7951473,4,B00005QY90,"Being a sucker for cheap DVDs, I recently purchased this at my local Suncoast for a whole $6.99.  I came home with it, assuming it would be bad.  The movies are cheesy, and the Silent Night movie isn't as indicated on the box, but in general this is a good buy.  Although cheesy, the movies are still quite enjoyable.  House on Haunted Hill and Don't Look in the Basement are classics (at least pseudo-classics).
If you are into cheap DVDs and don't mind a little cheese in your movies than this is the deal for you.",1080950400,2,516,4.34375
7951474,3,B00005QY90,"In order of preference:
House on Haunted Hill- the entertaining Vincent Price classic, very good picture quality.  This version comes with bonus trailers.
Don't Look in the Basement- grainy looking pic quality of a cult classic.  Very disturbing and creepy film with really good performances, but I might be biased since I find films about sanitariums unnerving anyway.(check out Amicus' anthology THE ASYLUM for a similar experience)
Silent Night, Bloody Night- ah, the controversial film of the four; but only because the set says it's Silent Night, Deadly Night(it's not the 80's Santa shocker that Siskel & Ebert was so offended by decades back).  This is a 70's movie that is not bad in its own right(grainy pic again).  Slow yet creepy, this also has asylum and incest connections to it.  Effectively disturbing flashback sequences.
Satan's School for Girls- honestly have not seen this one.  Saw Aaron Spelling's name in the credits...decided to turn it off.  It's a 70's made for tv horror with two members of Charlies' Angels in it.  When I get really bored and a nuclear holocaust wipes out all other known DVD's, I'll watch this one.  Maybe.
The discs have no extras with limited chapter stops and the case it came in is cheap plastic that broke(but I was able to 'snap' it back in place).  Not high-quality or a must-have collection by any means, but if you're a collector and enjoy your horror movies on the low-budget, 'hidden gems', or atmospheric-type variety  then this is not a bad purchase.",1035331200,7,1509,4.9015748031496065
7951475,5,B00005QY90,"Some of the people who have complained about this movie below have stated that they felt the box falsely advertised.  I don't understand what happened here.  I bought this movie and it CLEARLY said ""Silent Night BLOODY Night"" on it, and it had a different film description than some of the ones listed below.  Maybe there were some misprints on some editions of the collection?
Anyway, I liked this set anyway.  The film ""Don't Look in the Basement"" is a classic.  It alone is worth paying [money] for the set.  The other three movies aren't horrible either.  You could have something to watch when you are bored at least.  A-",1021420800,7,626,4.627272727272727
7951476,1,B00005QY90,"I bought this DVD movie set just for ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"" but unfortunately it does not actually come with it.  ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"" is advertised as one of the movies included in the package, but instead of getting that you actually get ""Silent Night, Bloody Night,"" a completely different movie.  This is not just a typo on the box because they even included the following movie description on the back of the box:
""One cold winter's night, on the night before christmas to be exact, a young boy watches as his parents are brutally killed by a thief dressed in a Santa suit.  Then, as the boy grows up in an orphanage, an ironhanded Mother Superior further bends his mind.  This boy, turned psychopath, will stop at nothing to erase the hatred in his heart...""
This is the description for ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"" so this is not just an honest mistake.  BCI Eclipse LLC, the distributers of this DVD, is a deceptive company that advertises A and gives you B.
Just in case anyone thinks that maybe there was a possibility of someone accidently putting the wrong DVD in the box, it's no accident.  I have a friend who ordered this movie at the same time I did and he got the same thing.",1012780800,10,1206,4.534562211981567
