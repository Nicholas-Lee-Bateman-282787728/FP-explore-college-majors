2874661,5,B000RPCK0G,What an awesome nostalgic piece of baseball tv. I wish the series would have lasted longer. I bought all the ones they had to offer.,1358380800,,132,4.32
2874662,5,B000RPCK0G,"Great show, wish they would make with with today's top sluggers! Definitely recommend this show for baseball lovers of all eras!",1358294400,,128,5.142857142857143
2874663,5,B000RPCK0G,"This is really a review of all three volumes of Home Run Derby. This is just enjoyable nostalgia, a look back to when baseball players wore flannel and were middle class, not the spoiled multi-millionaire pains they are today. Many of the ballplayer participants are gone now and this is a delightful look at who they were, plus a pleasant contest between two ballplayers ... puts a personality along with that baseball card that we have of these guys. Don't expect a technologically and theatrically polished program, here, but just a 1960-ish fun program. Baseball fans of the good old days will not be disappointed.",1261267200,,618,4.895238095238096

Homerun Derby was the show to watch. This dvd brought back many fond memories of those days. It is a treasure to behold for the simple reason that you get to see Mays, Mantle and Co. in their prime....as I remembered them. Worth every penny. Highly recommended.",1225152000,,635,5.913043478260869
2874665,5,B000RPCK0G,"Talk about a stroll down memory lane, the episodes are from a TV show that was taped at Wrigley Field (a minor-league ballpark) in Los Angeles, California, and featured the home-spun commentary of Mark Scott and the distinct calls from umpire Art Passarella.

Originally aired in 1959, the program has had nine-lives for the nine-inning contests, with it being shown in syndication, on Fox Sports Net, and on ESPN Classic, the last time being in 2005 on the latter.

With such sluggers as Bob Cerv, Ken Boyer, Mickey Mantle, Duke Snider, Willie Mays, Henry Aaaon and Gus Triandos, it was truly a showcase of stars in a timeless game of seeing who can lay the heaviest lumber on the baseball.

The DVD is the third of three volumes, which is the complete season of shows. This is a classic round-tripper that will keep the hot-stove league burning throughout the year.",1212451200,4,867,4.766666666666667
2874666,4,B000RPCK0G,"Nice look at baseball back in the day. Filmed in 1959 at Wrigley Field in LA, this series is not exactly action packed. The production values indicate clearly that this is a new medium at the time. That said, its great to see oldies like Aaron, Killebrew, a sober Mickey Mantle, Mays and others (including the reknowned Dick ""Dr Strangeglove"" Stuart - who made 29 errors at 1st base in 1963)get excited about winning $500.00 for hitting 3 HR in a row, or the $2000 prize for winning the contest. Each player sits with the host while the other is batting. All three volumes constitute the entire series I believe, so its best to get all of them. The titles ""Mays"" or ""Mantle"" or ""Aaron"" don't really mean much. Each volume follows the show in order.",1208217600,5,748,4.507352941176471
2874667,5,B000RPCK0G,"There was a time when professional athletes were nice, normal people, not the egocentric steroid-stuffed weirdos we know them as now. When baseball players looked normal, but maybe with slightly more ripped forearms than the average Joe. This video shows Mays, Killebrew, Hodges, Banks, Colavito, Jensen (Jackie) and a few others in that light, and heck--if you like baseball, you'll like it a lot. My favorite: Segment 7, with Ernie Banks vs, Jackie Jensen. But they're all good.",1200009600,,480,5.166666666666667
2874668,4,B000RPCK0G,"This is the final DVD in the TV Series.  It's a great DVD for the younger generation to watch because of the older baseball players that aren't around anymore and most have only heard of their names.  It's a simple series in a much simpler time and I think the biggest aspect of this series is the players are doing it all naturally, no steroid enhancement!!  It's sure worth a look and for any baseball enthusiast it's a nice addition to your collection.",1195516800,4,455,4.457831325301205

8202247,5,B000RPCK0G,"It took awhile to get here which is one star but the disc / show, itself, takes you back to the day. Sad about the host, Mark Scott. He passed away at the youthful age of 45 right after the shows final season of that damned cancer.",1514246400,,231,3.9361702127659575
