2814554,4,B000P7V4S0,"I expected this to be a documentary for some reason, but it was a pretty serious drama.  Once I realized that this was actually a ""movie"" I assumed it would be pretty bad since most movies of this type are.  But it actually turned out to be quite well written and a little crazy at times.  It held my interest for the entire time and I think it was about 2 hours long.",1245283200,,368,4.013698630136986
2814555,5,B000P7V4S0,russ parr put together an very good movie and show a dark side of stand up comedy and what they went through to get there.everyone should pick the dvd up and watch this film.,1232323200,,174,4.147058823529412
2814556,4,B000P7V4S0,I'd been hearing about Russ Parr's first film for a while and I couldn't wait to see it. The Last Stand explores the dark side of being a comic and the cast is first rate.,1226016000,,171,3.914285714285714
2814557,5,B000P7V4S0,"This movie had a good cast and DJ Russ Parr who's a black radio dj in Baltimore, Maryland did a good job for his first film. I hope to see more films from him. Anthony Anderson, Guy Torry, Tami Roman who used to be married to former NBA player Kenny Anderson and Darrin Henson did a good job. I'm pissed that Blockbuster Video doesn't have this movie so blacks can check it out. I'm willing to bet that a lot of blacks don't know about this film because Blockbuster doesn't have it and Hollywood Video probably doesn't have it either. I hope blacks do some research about this film and find it online so they can buy it and watch it. This film did a good job of showing how stand up black comedians go through good times and bad times trying to make it in the comedy business. Kevin Hart was funny too. He had me rolling when he was beating up and arguing with his doll who was a part of his comedy act LOL.",1190764800,6,907,4.129943502824859
2814558,3,B000P7V4S0,"this film is about people who are comedians who are dealing with real life situations and trying to make it the best way they can. this film touches on alot of subjects and it will make you think. it was a pretty good film, it went in alot of directions. very interesting.",1190332800,2,272,4.25
2814559,4,B000P7V4S0,"I don't know if this is Russ Par's first film, however I am impressed.  I found this to be a pretty descent movie with a great cast.  This movie takes you through, what I suspect, the many roads that comedians and aspiring actors/actresses can end up taking and experience filled with the good and mostly the bad.  Just like the movie says, it is about the drama behind comedy.  What I liked best was how the movie showed the characters' pasts and what brought them to doing comedy.  I also liked the dose of harsh reality given to show that the path to success in Hollywood is not easy and it can be a tough grind that not everyone will endure to the end.  I would recommend this film.",1184716800,8,686,4.27906976744186

2814566,4,B000P7V4S0,having a creative mind and someone else stilling your jokes for laughs is not cool therefore be your on original comedian,1408320000,,121,4.809523809523809

2814568,5,B000P7V4S0,I loved the I actually let my cousin borrow my DVD of it about  4 years and he kept it lol we lije the same movies so I thought about and reminded him he laughed and I said Cuzz I get another one you keep that one tge movie was very funny loved Kevin heart and the puppet I was laughing so hard but on the flip side it was serious as well showing how comedians go through their struggles each and every day Shout out to Russ Parr representing Maryland all day and making a good movie he has made others as well but he just needs to get them out there and let them be known more he makes good movies!,1405123200,,599,3.869918699186992
2814569,4,B000P7V4S0,"This was an engaging and entertaining movie. I thought that the parts were well acted and the story was compelling. I especially was surprised to see reality show staple Tami Roman as part of the cast, and impressed with her performance. Overall, I think that all of the silly negative 1 and 2 star reviews that imdb and other websites are showing on the Internet are completely unjustified. Give it a chance.",1403568000,,409,4.694444444444445
2814570,5,B000P7V4S0,"this was an excellent movie more that i had expected.  The acting was great.  this is one of those movie that makes you understand how so many comedians that are just starting in the business have to go through before you ever make it in HOLLYWOOD.  I watch this movie late in the evening and it was worse the lost of sleep.
I think this movie is neither a movie about blacks or whites or any race this movie is about everyday humans and their everday struggles in life.",1402963200,,470,4.258426966292135
2814571,5,B000P7V4S0,"I bought the movie over nine months ago and finally watched the movie recently. The movie was fantastic! It captivated my attention from beginning to end. TODD WILLIAMS had my complete, undivided attention. He is some kinna finnnnnnne!!!  In addition to that, I loved the intelligence, the strength and the ambition that he brought to his character. When a man reaches his emotional threshold, the result can be quite devastating. MR WILLIAMS' character shattered me at the end, because it was so unexpected. Brilliant work!  Darrin Dewitt Hensen truly expanded his range in this particular acting role. I believe that most Black men actors would not step to the challenge in playing the particular role which Mr. Hensen took upon. Mr. Hensen reminds me of Vingh Rhames--a man who is comfortable and at home with himself. I loved the movie so much that I ended up buying three more copies to share with family and friends. This movie is definitely a must see. Before I forget, Tami Roman ROCKED IT! I LOVE THAT GIRL!",1393632000,,1016,4.833333333333333
2814572,4,B000P7V4S0,It was better than I thought it would be. The actors did a pretty good job. Kevin Hart kills me he is too funny!,1381795200,,112,3.7083333333333335
2814573,4,B000P7V4S0,I found this movie to be pretty good with an ending I didn't expect. Had a little bit of everything. Would say more but don't want to give away too much.,1362355200,,153,3.967741935483871
2814574,5,B000P7V4S0,Everyone on the movie was funny and was a joy to watch. It is nice to sit back and see where people have grown.,1355356800,,111,3.6666666666666665

2814578,5,B000P7V4S0,"A realistic and hard hitting movie about 4 aspiring young blacks trying to break into comedy/acting.  The cast was great and did a good job.

One of the situations was something I had not expected:  There is a black couple in the film and the brotha is trying to pursue his dream...but gets resistence from his wife...because she DID NOT want him to SUCCEED!  The way the situation ends--does not make one feel good.

The writer/director, Russ Parr, said the characters and situations were based off actual past events.

Its worth a view!",1248739200,,538,4.731182795698925
