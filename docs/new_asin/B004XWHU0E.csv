4497705,4,B004XWHU0E,"I thought I knew a lot about China's history before I saw this movie but Mitch Anderson did a great job at finding well informed historians, professors, etc. for his interviews which were very informative! Comparing China's history to that of the western world is always an intriguing subject.",1330300800,2,293,5.0
4497706,4,B004XWHU0E,"Overall, this is a good documentary for individuals without much background on China's modern history. The most insightful portion of the video is the first half which juxtaposes the development of intellectual thought in both China and the West. A clear understanding of these points of origin is imperative for anyone interested in China, as is a firm grasp of how our two civilizations have developed throughout history.

While the documentary provides a good survey of the period, it did not exhaustively explore the full ""Century of Humiliation"" (i.e. 1839 - 1943; the first Opium War through the Cairo Conference--arguably you could extend this to the founding of the PRC in 1949). In fact, a bit more than half of the movie is spent on the aforementioned developments of Eastern and Western intellectualism, and the other 35 minutes or so on China's history from 1840 to the end of the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895).

It does not cover the second half of this ""century of humiliation,"" which included further encroachment by the imperial powers; most notably Japan's 21 demands, WWI and the setbacks encountered by secret treaties signed at the Paris Peace Conference, annexation and full scale invasion of Manchuria by Japan, and the atrocities carried out by the Japanese from 1937 - 1943. The self-inflicted wounds brought about by the civil war between the Nationalist and Communists during this period is also worthy of mention.

There is a lot more to this period than this documentary covers. While it's unfair to expect its directors to adequately address all of these issues, providing each event with the attention it deserves, the documentary could use a less misleading title. While quite a mouthful, something along the lines of ""The Intellectual Points of Origin of Chinese and Western Thought, and China's Initial Encounters with the West in the Late 19th Century"" may be more appropriate.",1327449600,15,1917,5.118210862619808
4497707,5,B004XWHU0E,"This is a must see for anyone interested in world history, economic history, and current events.  Despite the fact that the film is based in the 19th century, the conflicts described parallel a lot what is happening in the world today. Trade deficits, cultural misunderstandings, economic nationalism are thoroughly explored through the eyes of China and the West.
The panel of experts is superb, the opinions are very balanced and fair. No other Western made documentary went so far in getting the Chinese perspective on the last 200 years of history.
This film changed my view on the world and the Chinese culture.",1306281600,6,616,4.980582524271845
4497708,5,B004XWHU0E,"""China's Century of Humiliation"" is a fascinating account of Chinese history and in particular Chinese-Western relations. A sensible combination of Western and Chinese expert analysis, animation and film documents make Mitch Anderson's work a must-see film for everybody dealing with China these days. Mitch Anderson is certainly a master of his craft and he is able to tell a rather complex story without losing the thread.

This film helps Westerners to see China with different eyes and creates understanding at a much deeper level. It will be a valuable source for cross-cultural trainers and managers working in and with China and I can only highly recommend it.",1304553600,11,667,5.233644859813084
4497709,5,B004XWHU0E,"This film has arrayed an impressive cast of experts and his film provides a wonderfully informative exploration of Chinese history, politics, and culture.  One gets a real sense of how Chinese philosophy and religion have shaped a culture imbued with a sense of reverence for stability and collective life.  In addition the film's deft contrast of China with Western development and philosophy offers a respectful and informative view of both cultures and traditions. Overall, his film provides a deep foundation for understanding East/West interaction today and, as such, it is a must see if one cares about the future of world affairs.",1304035200,13,637,5.235294117647059
4497710,5,B004XWHU0E,"This is one of the best documentaries detailing the history of China.
I was very impressed with Mitch Anderson's meticulous work.
It was very informative with great production values overall.",1303948800,,191,5.4
4497711,5,B004XWHU0E,"China's Century of Humiliation gives the watcher just the right balance of educational and editorial content.  It helps students of China better understand the relationship between China and the West over the last three centuries in a way that is factual, yet dynamic and provocative. The use of Western and Chinese sources and content provides an objective narrative and the watcher benefits from the directors presentation of both perspectives. Interviews with experts and average Chinese also provide excellent supplementary support for the filmmakers contentions.  The film is an excellent teaching resource for university professors and could supplement even the most sophisticated observers understanding of China's Century of Humiliation.",1303948800,,745,5.888888888888889
4497712,5,B004XWHU0E,"Mitch Anderson's China's Century of Humiliation  is an in-depth look at the impact of China's history and culture on its relationship with the Western world.  Drawing on historical documents; interviews with international scholars, a prominent Chinese dissident, and a leading Chinese journalist; and glimpses inside modern-day Chinese life, it presents a balanced portrait of the often troubling Western involvement in China and how that involvement continues to affect China's view of and approach to world issues.  This is a must-see film for serious students of Chinese affairs and those who are simply seeking an understanding of what makes China tick.",1303948800,2,657,5.55
4497713,5,B004XWHU0E,"China's history is fascinating, and this documentary describes perfectly one of the most interesting moments of this history. Many illustrations, good interventions of experts. This film should definitely be seen by any students learning Chinese History, but also by anyone interested in the origins of what could be the first power in the world tomorrow.",1303948800,,355,5.472727272727273

8447521,1,B004XWHU0E,"I bought this video and watched it initially with enthusiasm, hoping it would be of comparable quality as ""China: A Century of Revolution.""  However, I was not impressed.  The anticipated enthusiasm dissipated quickly.  I wish I had something positive to say about this product, but I don't--it's amateur, shallow, and in my opinion an utter waste of consumer's time and money!  The producers/editors were not well versed in modern Chinese history.  Nor did they conduct a reasonable degree of research on the subject matter.  The video (yes, for it fails to live up to the name ""documentary"") contains a plethora of mistakes, misrepresentations, and sloppy editing works.  In one footage, for example, the editors used the image of 18th century American militia (perhaps from a scene about American Revolution) to represent the 19th century British and French soldiers.  In other instances, the editors used the pictures or paintings of the 19th century Qing Madarins to describe ancient Chinese officials or personas that lived over a thousand years ago.  One of the commentators, a Chinese journalist, made an array of sweeping claims about Chinese culture and history, including an unfounded claim that the idea of ""nation state"" had been deeply ingrained in the Chinese civilization for thousands of years.  The tawdry 3-D rendition of Chinese architectures and arts smacked of Orientalism, unsurprisingly.  In short, this video is of substandard quality, both in substance and form and in production.",1443571200,3,1506,5.312236286919831

8447525,4,B004XWHU0E,Excellent documentary. One gets an historical account providing insight into present day China which is view altering. There is some uncertainty as to how much bias there is in the telling and completeness of the film.,1392940800,2,218,5.083333333333333

8447528,5,B004XWHU0E,"This DVD contains a healthy approach towards international history and politics. It places China, its current situation, aims and developments against the background of a colonial history in which the Western powers played a major role. As such it aims to open some narrow minded ideas on China's impact on international economic developments and tries to objectify China as a world player, and not as an enemy of the West.",1351555200,,423,5.057142857142857

I learned a lot about the political and social workings of China in the 1800s. Very organized, very entertaining.",1330992000,,399,5.557377049180328

Well worth the $2 and hour of your life.

As I have felt since youth, I hope West and East can learn from each other, and can be open minded for the future.",1330387200,6,399,4.28
