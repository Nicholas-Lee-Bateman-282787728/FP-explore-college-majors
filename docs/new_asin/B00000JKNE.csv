Acts of Sacrifice is forty-three minutes and thirty seconds long and originally aired on February 22, 1995. There are two stories in this show; the main one a lesser secondary one. The main one deals with the arrival of Lumati to negotiate a treaty of alliance. The Lumati are an elitist people who believe in survival of the fittest. It falls to Commander Ivanova to get the Lumati people to sign on. Commander Ivanova shows the Lumati delegation around the more safe and beautiful areas of Babylon, the Lumati are unimpressed. While at Commander Ivanova quarters the next morning, Ivanova tell them to pick a place and she will show them area. The Lumati choose Down Below to be shown around. When the Lumati see Down Below, they are impressed on how the station has isolated the inferior species. The Lumati are ready to sign the treaty. To conclude the treaty the Lumati chooses to have sex with Susan Ivanova, as is their custom with any treaty. Susan is almost in a state of shock and does not want the treaty to fall apart. She thinks of sex act to full Correlilmurzon (the Lumati who wants to have sex act). You have to watch the scene to get a full explanation of what went on. I will say it is funny. Correlilmurzon leaves the room in disappointment because he thought it would be more intense. His aide Taq knows he was tricked and leaves the room laughing. In the end Correlilmurzon gives Susan a present with a note saying: next time my way. In lesser secondary story, G'Kar goes to Delenn and Captain Sheridan seeking aid to his people, mainly military aid. Earth government does not want to get involved and Delenn's people are tired of war. Also G'Kar leadership is in question by his fellow Narns. G'Kar has to fight a fellow Narn that he is still in command. G'Kar wins the fight. After the fight G'Kar meets with Delenn and Captain Sheridan and they tell him that they can only give him humanitarian aide and this is all unofficial and must be kept quiet. G'Kar thanks them both and leaves. He begins to weep knowing that his people are in this fight alone and is a fight they cannot win.
