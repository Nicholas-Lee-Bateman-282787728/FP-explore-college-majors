8685841,1,B00OZOIIOC,"Skin was made in 1980 about the American occupation of Italy and the sex trade that occurred during 1943/1944 after Italy surrendered and switched to the allied side.  It is primarily set in Naples.  The film is deemed a documentary.  It is based upon a series of stories and incidences of desperate Italian people during this time who were starving, and thus engaged in every form of prostitution for money or food.

There is nudity and sex in the movie...which in the U.S. would have received a NC 17 rating.  Made in 1980, the movie is not accurate in portraying war torn Italy, as the character's are lavishly dressed and the town looks immaculate, not at all representative of a war torn starving country.  People starving are constantly being referred to, yet their is food everywhere.

This movie does not present Americans in a good light. Americans are portrayed as lavish liberators whose only concern is for prostitutes, sex or money.  The movie may be a documentary, but the story line is a series of incidences that are probably both taken out of context",1468368000,2,1067,4.760869565217392
8685842,4,B00OZOIIOC,"Inspired by the horrid war memories experienced by Curzio Malaparte, Liliana Cavani took for herself the brave challenge to adapt this brutal story into screen.

I think you should go for the book at first in order to be aware and dealing with the existential horror, the moral depression and the social bleakness of an Italy in wreck (Naples) at the end of the WW2. Otherwise, you will be shocked by those powerful and bizarre images surrounded by a bitter script that reflects incisively the hellish ambiance of a -no way out-  nation .

From start to finish you must accept these terms. It's not an allegory about the wounds of a War. It goes far beyond and will lead you to the core of hell.

Marvelous performances of Marcello Mastroianni and Claudia Cardinale. Go for this one. Once again. Not recommended for squeamish.",1461024000,,826,4.715277777777778
8685843,1,B00OZOIIOC,The worst movie ever. Don't think about spending any money on this fiasco.,1444348800,,74,4.769230769230769
8685844,4,B00OZOIIOC,Quite a shocking experience! I am ambivalent about this movie: it has many good things but also some bad ones; some of the scenes are hard to stomach and the story is somewhat erratic but as a depiction of the conditions in Italy towards the end of the Second World War it is a valuable document,1426809600,,295,4.285714285714286
8685845,5,B00OZOIIOC,"This is a beautiful , yet controversial movie. But very much worth getting it . I am a big fan of Liliana Cavani, and this movie is just one of her best. The only issue is that the parts played by the American roles should have been rather in English . It seems kind of awkward to listen them speaking in Italian and being translated to italian..",1426636800,,346,4.17910447761194
8685846,2,B00OZOIIOC,A bit disappointed as I didn't realise that it was all in Italian with English sub titles I would not have bought it if I had realised this. I bought it because of Burt Lancaster being in it.,1423872000,,191,4.052631578947368
8685847,4,B00OZOIIOC,"***WARNING TO THOSE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THIS MOVIE OR THE WORKS OF MALAPARTE -- This is not a normal war movie, nor an entertainment piece.  It is not a literal depiction of the U.S. occupation, but does try to make a point through unsettling imagery, racial slurs, and sexual desperations.  Though it did not suit my tastes, please accept this attempt to explain the movie and allow each individual to make their own choice before watching.  As a former soldier I feel I understand, even if I don't always agree with it's message.

This is one of those works of cinema specifically designed to illustrate that movies have more uses than simply to entertain.  I think to understand this movie at all, one has to know something about Malaparte's background and his writings.  Though this movie is particularly difficult to watch, it does accomplish it's designed purpose.  It is generally faithful to the novel by Malaparte while conveying it's spirit deftly.  That is not the same as saying most people will like it.  The vulgarity and sheer condensement of desperate actions are almost absurd at times, though based on elements of truth.  They are like a caricature drawing or even fun-house mirror that expose the uglier truths of human appearance, even though that appearance is not literally accurate.  It's exaggeration drives directly at those ugly parts of human nature and depict the spirit of wretchedness that Malaparte could have viewed first hand.  Indeed, this is a war movie designed more for the intellectual or art house crowd. It is well shot and many of the performances are quite good.  The Blu Ray transfer was also pretty clean.

THE PLOT:  Curzio Malaparte himself (Marcello Mastroianni) is a central figure as he serves as Liaison to the U.S. forces landing in Naples 1943.  Though the war is still on, Naples has settled into a state of occupation.  The movie illustrates by concentration of desperate scenes the chaos, uncertainty, and depravity that even a liberated populace can experience in the aftermath of war.  Malaparte is in the unique position of mixing with many levels of society as he associates with Neapolitan aristocracy, the commanding U.S. general (Burt Lancaster), common soldiers, and the lowest classes of the poor.  One young American officer is also assigned to work with him in several endeavors.  In the midst of it all, an American Senator's wife (Alexandra King) comes to visit and befriends Malaparte.  A famous aviator in the vain of Earhart, she seems to be an obvious swipe at the idea of American Exceptionalism as the movie contrasts her accomplishments and naivet with the harsh reality of people just trying to survive.  In fact, the whole American presence is in focus, being quite nave, apple pie and judgmental, while also availing themselves of the ubiquitous sexual commerce and debauchery.  Racial stereotypes and  slurs are hurled everywhere, painting uneasy tension between Italian & American, or African Americans from almost everyone.  The movie doesn't question their gratitude for American intervention in the war, it simply expresses a European feeling of wretchedness and struggle for survival as the war moves past them.  Again, in contrast to American naivet and judgment.  I am not saying these are my ideas, I am saying that's what the book and this movie seem to express.  I can accept that I see how they might feel that way.

FINAL THOUGHTS:  On a personal level, I didn't enjoy this movie and didn't feel any more instructed on the ravages of war or it's aftermath.  But then I have seen what it's like with almost a decade in combat zones.  Conversely, most soldiers can tell you we have heard similar dialog and language throughout our career.  They have seen American naivet, people's desperation, and conflict with even the people we try to help. It's true that racial sentiment was different back in WWII as well.  You would likely hear the N word, D-go, Wap, all being thrown around (it might still start a fight).  Children in particular are often exploited in the chaos of war, though maybe not as obviously as shown here.  As an amateur film enthusiast, I am willing to acknowledge a work, much as I would a painting by an accomplished painter that I don't appreciate.  It may not be for me, but that doesn't mean the artist has no skill.  Malaparte's politics are not my own, but his writings can be interesting.  His unique vantage point of the Mussolini regime, and of Europe WWI & WWII have value.  If you are still drawn to this film after my description, I highly suggest a rental before buying.  It's not the kind of thing you watch repeatedly anyway.  This movie wasn't made for people like me.  But I hope you will accept an objective attempt to describe and allow people to decide for themselves.",1421193600,20,4795,4.875154511742893
8685848,4,B00OZOIIOC,"A wonderful, unsettling film. Well worth your time. No easy or pat answers...just a lot to consider. Please note, this film is about eight minutes shorter than the 142 minutes stated on DVD case. I'm not sure I could have handled another eight minutes. I mean that as a compliment.",1421193600,3,281,4.64
