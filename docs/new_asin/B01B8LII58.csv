8749655,5,B01B8LII58,"Excellent instructional video!  The video includes about two hours of basic barre exercises. I almost hesitate to use the word ""basic,"" and definitely not  ""beginner,"" because there is really a lot to work with here, and it would take any dancer quite some time (literally years) to truly master all of the material presented.  To the untrained eye, many of the exercises may look pretty simple, but I assure you it is not easy to execute them properly.  It takes a lot of time, effort, and commitment to truly master the fundamental steps and movements of ballet, and this video will definitely be a great help to anyone who desires to do so.  The demonstrations of each movement are clear and precise, and the dancer chosen to model the movements is superb.  In my opinion, this is a great tool for any serious ballet student.",1499731200,6,828,4.675862068965517
