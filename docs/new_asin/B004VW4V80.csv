4484719,5,B004VW4V80,Great movie. Really enjoyed watchin it. Don't want to talk about movie because I don't want to give it up. Butit was enjoyable. Shipping was fast and arrived in perfect condition. Definitely recommended seller.,1330128000,5,210,5.205882352941177
4484720,2,B004VW4V80,"It was an evening's entertainment.  If you like the adventure of violent storm, graphic injury, with an aggressive bear on the chase, it could hold your attention.  The story is of a step-mother and teen coming together, with the father actually paying attention to the teen.  I see how it is the teen could say her step-mother was a know-it-all.  She was a bit too well informed, even in my opinion.  The teen does rise to expectation, but the wrap-up scene of a very pregnant mother, with a very revealing neckline was a very unexpected scene. It is not a movie I would choose to watch again, nor recommend to others.",1327708800,6,619,4.54054054054054
4484721,3,B004VW4V80,"The plot is good, the acting is good and the scenery is good.  The only fault I can find with this movie is the language.  The cursing is mild with only a few uses of three different expletives.  I have decided to rate (the many) movies I watch myself from the perspective of a Christian man looking for entertainment that won't teach my child to use curse words before her 3rd birthday.  I deduct 1 star for 1 or 2 expletives and automatically deduct another star for 3.  If I hear 4 or more or if any words are really offensive I stop it and it is rated 1 star regardless of any other considerations.  There is no nudity or blasphemous content.  This is one of those movies which makes no reference to God at all so it can't really be called Christian.  The rating systems in place are not adequate so I write my own reviews; I hope to help others like myself who would like to be forewarned if a movie is not acceptable viewing for the entire family.  This movie is not rated.",1325721600,2,979,4.220430107526882
4484722,2,B004VW4V80,"It turned out that I got the wrong movie. I was very dissapointed and want to return it for something else. Sincerely,  Kathleen Cadigan",1320883200,,136,4.666666666666667
4484723,4,B004VW4V80,"Tough to make a clean family type adventure film without being too sappy, poorly shot or overacted.  Take this for what it is, and it makes for an OK entertaining night at the movies.

Dad(Jason Priestly) takes new wife of two years and teenage ""don't want to be there"" daughter from first marriage on boating trip to beautiful but isolated Bear Island to have family connection.

Storm kicks in, boat shipwrecks, and there just happens to be an angry grizzly on the not so Gilliganish island.  With the man injured, the women take charge.

The scenery's great, the acting's adequate, the survival choices, for the most part, are quite reasonable, the story's of course predictable, and there's a cool bear doing his acting with gusto.

I give it 3 1/2 stars.  No language, no sex, no real blood and guts, but too stressful for little ones to watch: Dad gets hurt, bear's trying to kill them.  I think OK preteens and older.  The extras include a 'making of' documentary.",1311897600,17,971,4.6982248520710055
4484724,3,B004VW4V80,"Courage was overly dramatic and somewhat unrealistic! The movies soundtrack always indicated what was going to happen by the minute and therefore this ruined the suspense element. Overall, the movie had a great message surrounding around family, trust, faith n fate, and the power of courage and intuition. This movie is not the best but it's worth the thrill if your looking for a ""Anaconda"", ""Cast away"", or Perfect Storm knock off.",1310169600,,434,5.041666666666667
4484725,3,B004VW4V80,"""Dear God, please protect us from this storm.""  After receiving the news that his new book is not selling and the store he works at is going to close because of it Robert (Priestley) decides the best way to clear his head is to get on his boat with his family and get away for the weekend.  While on the way to the island getaway a storm hits and the family is stuck on an island, but they are not alone.  Being that this is a movie from the ""Faith & Family"" series, I was expecting some cheesiness from this.  I was not dissapointed.  This is a hard movie to review.  There really is no substance to this movie.  The acting is pretty bad, and the movie seems to get more and more absurd.  That being said, it is a religious themed movie and all of that stuff is to be expected so it can't be docked because of it.  It you have seen any of the other ""Faith & Family"" movies you will know what to expect from this one.  If you are looking for a feel good, uplifting movie this is a good one to pick, but again there is not much to this one.  Overall, not good, but not bad either.  A decent one time watch.  I give it a C.

Would I watch again? - No I wouldn't

4484796,2,B004VW4V80,"So much in the movie is unrealistic and my 14 y/o son and 11 y/o daughter both laughed about the movie being so cheesy. I won't list all cheesy parts but rule #1--you never run from a Grizzly bear. The movie isn't terribly expensive, thank goodness.  We won't be adding it to our movie library.  Before the movie ended, our children said, ""don't keep it.""  They both agreed they'd never watch it again.  Maybe younger children wouldn't notice but too many unrealistic scenes.  Just the scene of running from the grizzly is dangerous if children think that is what one does when they encounter a grizzly.  Could have had the potential to be a good movie with some good survival skills added in but they really dropped the ball in that regard. Wish I could give it a better review but it was somewhat painful to sit through it.  Our family enjoys a lot of Christian independent films and are very conservative in what we watch so it's not a matter of needing a bunch of action and hype to entertain us.",1380240000,10,1000,4.461538461538462
