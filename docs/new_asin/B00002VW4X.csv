1256313,5,B00002VW4X,"This is a compilation of clips from the Banned from TV videos, showing various clips from around the world of graphic executions, accidents,  robberies, animal attacks & deaths. There are 45 chapters, and the DVD  runs for 106 minutes. The last chapter shows the infamous scene where a  woman is run over by a train. The picture is generally good; some of the  chapters are poor image quality because of the cameras that shot them. The  sound is in stereo. One to watch if you like watching 'real' graphic  footage, unlike Faces of Death.",967075200,18,538,4.670212765957447
1256314,4,B00002VW4X,"The typical shock video , this time of many horrific on camera deaths. The first 15 minutes with be an eye opener as many don't get to see this type of video. As the parading of death drags on, the scenes become a bit  mind-numbing and I got a bit immune to the violence. But the best was saved  for last. The scene where this STUPID woman got her just ending for being  in too much of a hurry. Its people like this I just shake my head at. Over  all, pretty interesting but you'll only watch it 2-3 times in your life.  Find a friend who has it.",962496000,4,546,3.9724770642201834

7916306,4,B00002VW4X,"If you just want to see unsual programming with some injury, death, or hostage taking, it is worth a look. It will pass the time, but is is less violent in some cases than what you can find on the internet today.  I like it, but other may find it okay or obsolete",1378425600,,263,3.9622641509433962
7916307,4,B00002VW4X,"This DVD is a collection of footage deemed too shocking/obscene for mainstream TV. What's in this collection you ask? Convenience store clerk shootings, police chases and shooting caught from their cruiser cams, a skydiving accident, Mardi Gra footage, sports and stunt related accidents, an elephant rampage in Hawaii (I saw this on the CBS evening news un-cut!), a pit bull attack on a animal control officer (saw this one too un-cut), undercover sex sting footage, a domestic dispute on a front porch turns deadly and is caught by the home owner's security camera, a man falling to his death from a radio tower, the 2 Live Crew footage that caused charges to be filed against them, a gang related shooting in a pool hall,...you should get the picture by now.
There is some footage that really stands out for me in this collection.
1) A hostage stand-off in Columbia. A teenager holds a woman at gunpoint on the sidewalk after a bungled robbery only to be shot in the head by a police sniper! Yes, you can clearly see the bullet's impact!
2) Another hostage stand-off this time in Arizona (the commentator gets it wrong and says it's in Mexico City. I saw it on 60 Minutes edited. They were doing a story on the police sniper.) The quality isn't all that great but you can still see the bullet impact and his wig fly off!
3) A stand-off in N.C. where a man refuses to come out of his house after a report that he threatened his father. He walks onto the porch with a shotgun then walks around to the side of the house where the SWAT team is hiding. He points his shotgun at them and gets cut down by a cop with an MP5. If you look real close you'll notice that the cop missed a few times!
4) A public execution in Guatemala. Two men are tied to posts and shot by a firing squad. They both survive the initial shooting. They are finished of with shots to the head! I think that the men on that firing squad needed more target practice since they appear to be such lousy shots!
5) A group of disgruntled government workers take over a government building with other employees as hostages in El Salvador. They are stormed by the police using tear gas and pepper spray. In one scene a man runs out of the building and is shot point blank in the upper chest by a cop with a shotgun! You can see the blood gush out onto the sidewalk!
6) A woman in is hit by a train at a crossing! OUCH!!! You won't ever see this one on TV!
I have a few gripes with this DVD which is why I only gave it 4 stars.
1) Where is the footage of former Pennsylvania treasurer Bud Dwyer who committed public suicide at a news conference? That was banned from TV! I saw the clip but it was stopped before he put the gun into his mouth.
2) The classic footage of a Viet Cong prisoner being shot in the head by the Saigon's police chief during the Tet offensive is not included. While it was not banned from TV, it is a classic clip!
3) Where is the footage of Vic Morrow being decapitated in the filming of The Twilight Zone? That was banned from TV!
4) The shark attack footage was poor. You can briefly see the shark in the water next to the swimmer but the camera jumps too much for a clear view.
5) The way the clips are organized is poor. Instead of having all the chase footage together they are spread out on the DVD. Same thing for the killing footage.
6) They included the Mardi Gra footage along with another footage at a beach party where women show their breasts. While technically this is banned from TV, the average buyer of this material is after the carnage footage. If I want to see topless women I'll buy the ""Girls Gone Wild"" DVDs.
If you have any interest in the dark side of human nature this DVD is for you!",1080518400,7,3698,4.284285714285715
7916308,5,B00002VW4X,"After I purchased Banned from Television, I watched it four times straight. Reason I watched this documentary over and over is because after I was done watching it the first time I immediately called all my buddies and had them come over and watch it. There was many, many scenes that I had to rewind to see again.
This video in not for the person with the weak stomach. This video is nothing like Faces of Death. This is all live footage with nothing made up. A few scenes will make you laugh and most others will make you say, ""Man, glad I don't live in that country.""
Here is a brief description of some of the stuff you'll see:
1) Hostages with guns pointing at their heads and sharpshooters coming to the rescue.
2) Whenever you see the name of a city in ""Brazil"" at the bottom of the screen, prepare to see something devastating. It looks like Brazil doesn't believe in taking people to jail.
3) In my opinion, the top two most eye-widening scenes are, one, when a man is tied to a tree then set ablaze and two, when a lady gets hit by a train.
People who watch these videos are Not sick individuals. We don't get ammused or turned on by watching people die. Inside, all were looking for is something to ""Wow"" or ""Woe"" us. The video lives by its subtitle, ""It Will Shock You!""",1045699200,8,1282,4.301652892561983
7916309,4,B00002VW4X,"After hearing so much about this DVD I just had to find out what all the fuss was about. Oh my god!!...I was totally shocked and amazed at some of the raw, graphic footage on show here. It brings to light some of the sad aspects of human life and how fragile we all really are..it also demonstrates the inhumanity of man to himself, as well as the stupid risks people take to impress others. I found myself stunned at the various faces of death and hope no one is unfortunate to suffer some of the very painful and sad images here. Anyone who is weak hearted should avoid this , otherwise it makes for a fascinating insight into the darker side of human nature.",1030492800,,661,4.296
7916310,2,B00002VW4X,"This video it is what it says it is. Shocking violent and even i found interesting as a title to buy it for my collection i never watched to the end it because after a while i felt that i must be really sick to finish it.
It is surely unsencored but i prefer censorhip on scenes like that.",1003968000,2,289,3.9152542372881354
7916311,4,B00002VW4X,"This DVD was one that I anticipated. I was un-nerved at some of the violent scenes. Very graphic and intense! It is hard to believe that some of these things happen in our world! Plenty of nudity in this as well. Over all I would rate it better than some of the Faces of Death DVDs. Simply because all of this is real. The video quality is as good as the original tapes they were taken from. Most are very clear. The sound is the same way. I only gave it four stars because I think it could have been longer with less police chase scenes. But over all it is good. If you enjoy watching real life violence and some nudity, I recommend this. If not, don't even think about it.",1002585600,6,674,4.113636363636363
7916312,5,B00002VW4X,"This vid is cool! At the beginning a guy gets chased by the cops, pulls over, then his head goes flying off from a shotgun blast!
Also has a stupid woman who walks right into a train! Suicide or Stupidity?
Also includes: BMX crash, guy falling from antenna, and alot of other cool stuff.
It's like RealTV except people die! Get this if you get Faces Of Death, Cky2k, Des Morts, The Strange and The Gruesome, or Mondo Cane!
PS. For all the [week stomachs]: get a barf bag!",991008000,4,471,4.303370786516854
7916313,5,B00002VW4X,"For someone with a weak heart like me, I needed to watch this DVD to completely destroy my weakness from the inside. But still I do not recommend it for anybody with weak hearts... it took me some time to be able to watch this and accept it... but I am glad that I did.
This is a MASTER PIECE! For all fans of such interests, this is a must buy!
After the disappointment of Faces Of Death being nothing but lies and crap... there could be nothing as good as this! I wish if someone could tell me where can I find good DVD's as this one but apparently there isn't any!
This DVD shows you how blessed we are not to face such tragedies... there are so many violant scenes that are so cruel but still it is worth watching since you can never see anything like this out there in the world (THANK GOD)!",987811200,,796,4.076433121019108
