2630252,5,B000H7JCEQ,"This is without a doubt the best CSI-show!
Interesting stories, nice camera, charismatic actors,
better then CSI:NY and much better then CSI:Las Vegas.

Why do they keep us waiting so long for season 5???",1184198400,,204,5.0
2630253,5,B000H7JCEQ,"I have been a fan of all three CSI shows, for some time, because I love Forensics. I began to watch CSI Miami, more than the others, because I became so interested in the characters. I couldn`t believe how compassionate the Medical Examiner (Khandi Alexander) was, with her ""charges"". It also became a mystery to me about the complicated plots, and how they figured out the truth! The reason I bought the DVDs, besides being able to see them whenever I wanted, was because I missed quite a few shows, and had to watch re-runs. During some of the re-runs, things were mentioned, that I had no idea what they meant, and I was intent on finding out the answers. Thanks to the DVDs, I can find out all the answers. I think the CSI Series are some of the best shows on TV.",1175472000,5,767,4.333333333333333

8137318,5,B000H7JCEQ,"OH! It's my Hubby. He looks dead to the world but he is just glued to this C.S.I. MAIMI COLLECTION. My fault. I bought it for him. And he watches over and over and over again. Laptop on lap,earbuds in ears and he's David Caruso(without hair). Well as long as he is where he should be who am I to complain.

Thanks C.S.I and Amazon",1227312000,,330,4.076923076923077

8137323,5,B000H7JCEQ,"I am a late bloomer when it come to some of the television shows.  I have only in the past year began to get addicted to this particular CSI series.  When I started out I had to buy all of the previous seasons to catch up with what was going on.  Then since David Caruso is such and interesting character, I looked up and bought NYPD Blue because he starred in it the first season.

I love the scenery, being a north Floridian I appreciate the beauty of the area and envy the tropical follage that grows there.  Miami is one of the stars of this show, the characters are interesting and complex and you just can't seem to get enough of them.

Worth the price, they made this summer of re-runs more bearable.",1188518400,,707,4.2388059701492535
8137324,5,B000H7JCEQ,I have been searching for CSI Miami seasons 1 thru 4. It was just too expensive. My sister in law advised me of Amazon. I am greatful that she told me about it. As I saved about $100.00. I do appreciate the savings. Thanks.,1186272000,,223,4.090909090909091
