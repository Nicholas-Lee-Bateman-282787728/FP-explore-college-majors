I would highly recommend Cold River ( the book) by William Judson. I don't believe I have ever read his works before. Even though the book is supposedly a young adult novel I think many teens might not stick with such a grim book, one that is bluntly honest and pulls no punches. I am not going to try not to give away spoilers but will say that this is a book about surviving one of the worst snow storms of the century back in 1921. Those facing this include two teens, a brother and sister who have to accept the reality of their situation and try to make it.

It would not be credible except for the fact that both teens have gone on regular camping trips with their father, a man who believed in being able to live off the land. He was not the gentlest of parents but he had prepared his kids for basic survival. Because of the times, he believed in being prepared. He couldn't take for granted so much that we have now.

Anyway, they would all face harsh conditions (father and teens), depending primarily on their survival skills. Luckily, their skills had been tested somewhat in those camping trips - where everything they carried had a purpose or it didn't come along. They do have the advantage of a canoe, since their most recent camping trip is partly by canoe. As events occur, this becomes almost like a Deliverance (if you saw the movie or read the book) for teens, without any graphic sexual scenes.

For those who have read the book and knows what happens, please remember that I have intentionally left out some key parts of the plot in order not to spoil things. One key part happens well into the book, changing so much of the rest of the book.

There is a world of difference between getting through a basic camping trip, even if you have to depend on fishing and hunting,  and surviving terrible cold. I learned some new things in parts of this book. For instance, I didn't know you could get sick from eating only meat (I forget what that condition was called) . It seemed fairly realistic to me, especially the no nonsense tone. This is not a sentimental book. Anyone else read it?

It got solid reviews by many as well as both local and national publications. I honestly don't know why it hasn't been made into a BETTER movie. Since it is a relatively short and suspenseful book, it would be riveting and have the bonus of being far more educational than much of the stuff out there. By the way, if you look at the book, I have reviewed it and pretty much in these words so my review won't be anything new. I'm considered buying more copies to supplement the stuff my kids have to read in school. Homeschoolers should have this in their basic library as should anyone with an interest in survival related fiction.",1279238400,,2893,4.649706457925636
1653127,4,B00005R2CF,"This independent film did well in Sundance and started off the (unfortunately) short-lived career of Fred G. Sullivan of Saranac Lake, N.Y.  Taken from the novel by William Judson, it contains the mild but rich story of a brother and a sister stranded in the 1920 wilderness of the Adirondacks to survive.  On a shoe-string budget, Sullivan manages to capture the heart and spirit of the Adirondack Mountains as well as the characters of the young siblings as they struggle through a winter of turmoil in the mountains.  It si no small feat that James Earl Jones plays the kind-hearted hermit who takes the children in for a while and the ending is a surprise for all when the small boy is pitted against a criminally minded convict who will stop at nothing.  It is the kind of family film you would see on PBS; it is that rewarding.

Fred G. Sullivan went on to receive accolades at the Sundance Film Festival with his follow-up, ""Sullivan's Pavilion"", a story of his life and family in Saranac Lake, N.Y.  If you can find this rare treasure, it is truly worth the effort.",1215734400,,1073,4.591623036649215
1653128,1,B00005R2CF,"I have my students read the book Cold River in school.  I was excited to see a video of this story as it is a favorite.  But, this video is terrible.  They have changed so much from the book.  My advice--read the book and forget the video.  Holes is the best movie I have seen that came from a kid's book.",1184716800,,305,3.9344262295081966

1653130,3,B00005R2CF,"This film, by the same filmmaker who did ""The Beer Drinker's Guide to Fitness and Filmmaking,"" while rough around the edges, is a good survival tale and shows two kids in a realistic way, getting along as best they can, sometimes fighting, sometimes caring.  None of the acting is going to win an award (though the actor who plays the bad guy does a terrific job). I enjoyed both of this director's films--despite their numerous shortcomings-- and would be interested to know what's become of him.  I'd watch something else he did, as he seems like someone with original ideas who could blossom.",1132444800,,595,4.766990291262136
1653131,1,B00005R2CF,"I saw this movie about 15 years ago on TV and quite liked it. I'm sorry to say that most of the memorable scenes are cut from this DVD, so it's pretty watered down. And the cut's are made so obviously that even if you haven't seen it before they absolutely interrupt the flow of the movie.",1107216000,,289,4.087719298245614
1653142,3,B00005R2CF,"I first saw this movie as a teenager and was glad that this movie is still available!  This isn't a GREAT movie.  It is a very GOOD movie.
The one thing that struck me about this movie when I first saw it was how two young kids struck with a horrible tradegy survive in the wilderness on their own.  Sort of a dumbed down version of the ""The Edge"" with Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins and a much younger cast.
If you're looking for a ""safe"" movie for your kids and one that deals with overcoming hardship you're picking up the right video.",1006041600,,540,4.223300970873787
1653143,2,B00005R2CF,This movie was pretty bad. It's a little to violent and it is pretty sexist. It was very fake and to many heart-thumping things happen. Get another video if I were you.,999561600,,168,4.28125

7951714,1,B00005R2CF,I'm giving this a low rating!! This was listed as a family movie and although the rating is PG it should not. Like other reviewers said it is low acting but it is good enough for kids. The low rating is for the RAPE SCENE!! I picked this movie for my husband and I and our 9 yr old boy.,1483833600,,286,3.783333333333333
