3871614,1,B00283PUSY,"I've seldom if ever rated a video 1 star.  I had watched a recent documentary about the Whites, so was looking forward to this movie.  However, though it's supposed to be based on the life of Jesco White, it's a travesty.  None of the trashiness or criminal bent of the family is portrayed, and Jesco is alive and well today--unlike the Jesco of the movie.  The casting and acting are poor. Just an awful film",1358380800,2,409,4.413333333333333
3871615,1,B00283PUSY,"This movie was a fairytale, unconnected to reality and loaded with unnecessary gratuitous violence that never happened. It's too bad they didn't try to pattern it after Jesco's real life which had nothing in common with this movie.",1355616000,6,231,5.105263157894737
3871616,1,B00283PUSY,"Let me start by saying this is not an accurate representation of Jesco White at all. It is an insult to his name as well as his family. I guess the director was trying to make an ""art film"" but this is absolute garbage. Edward Hogg gave a pretty decent performance, but his acting and facial expressions became repetitive after a while and he ultimately fell over the side of the pool in to what is known as over-acting. There were far too many ""gross out"" moments in the movie; the director tried too hard to achieve shock value and it came off as contrived and cartoon-ish. The fire 'n brimstone sermons that punctuated the movie didn't have much to do with the movie at all, until what I can only describe as the most bizarre ending I've ever seen in a movie. As far what brought Carrie Fisher in to this movie is a mystery to me. She must have owed the film makers a favor. In all honesty, the only actor that didn't disappoint me was the man (I'm not sure what his name is) that played guitar for the scenes where they were out on the road performing. During the climax of the movie, there was a ""song"" that was made up of what sounded like an out-of-tune electric guitar being scratched on the strings with a metal file and someone with no vocal talent bellowing out the same unintelligible phrases over and over and over. The makers of this movie tried to portray Jesco as a crazed, violent, paranoid, demon-possessed meth addict. This movie was simply another way to make a caricature of Jesco White as well as the rest of the people of West Virginia in an attempt to heap even more scorn and mockery on them. Thankfully, I watched this movie streaming and consider myself fortunate to have not wasted much money on this trash. If you want to see the real Jesco White, watch the classic The Dancing Outlaw or better yet, catch his show next time he's touring through your area.",1349049600,4,1885,4.404011461318052
3871617,4,B00283PUSY,"Dear people,

T.V. is not ""real life.""
Movies are not ""real life.""
Reality T.V. is not ""real life.""
Documentaries are not ""real life.""

Real life is ""real life.""

Someone has been lying to you. They are all forms of entertainment. If a movie says ""Based upon a true story,"" it is just that...Based. It, in itself, is not true. In case someone out there thinks reality T.V. is real, well, put a camera in front of someone and tell them to act ""normal."" What you get is not real, but a performance for the camera that they know that is there recording them. Entertainment and nothing more. Please watch the film ""Real Life"" by Albert Brooks if you need visuals.

Now that the above has been said, White Lightin' is a really good movie. It is very entertaining. I have seen all the documentaries and clips about Jesco and recognize all of his talents...Dancing, story-telling,ETC. My only hope is that this fictionalized movie keeps him alive in people's minds and that he got a couple of bucks in the process to carry on. He really does have talent. See him live if possible.

Keep it ""Real.""",1348617600,6,1090,4.540816326530612

If viewing dysfunctional families from the privacy (and safety) of your home brings you enjoyment, then these three films are a must for your library.  Each of these films (this a  retelling of his early childhood and onwards played out by actors and the other two documentaries) is laced equally with humor and pathos and well worth the viewing.

3871619,1,B00283PUSY,"Terrible portrayal of beloved Jesco.  I wonder what he thinks of this portrayal of himself, because it is more of a betrayal in my mind.  I don't know why they felt they had to base it on Jesco.  Why not give it another name and leave Jesco out of it.  If you love the dancing outlaw, DON'T waste your time on this.  You will be disappointed.",1313712000,6,342,4.121212121212121
3871620,2,B00283PUSY,"A couple of the other reviewers here have pointed out ""this movie isn't for everyone"" and I'm proof.  I was anticipating something good having heard about real-life dancing outlaw Jesco White and this movie based loosely on his life (very, very, very loosely based on his life or reality at all in retrospect).  Unfortunately this is more a study in insanity than a story about Jesco White, so I was disappointed.  Surely there will be many who appreciate this movie for its very harsh, stark portrayal of one man's decline into all sorts of mental breakdown and resulting physical violence.  It is admittedly powerful, hard to watch stuff.  Sadly, after enduring the brutality there wasn't much to take away.  It's far too interpretive and abstract to really give a glimpse into the real Jesco White, and it never bothers humanizing the characters at all.  Perhaps that was the point - are these hillbillies real human beings at all?  In any case, for me White Lightnin' was a missed opportunity more than anything.  I don't know much more about Jesco White than before, and if he's anything like those in this movie I probably don't want to.  But something tells me there is a more interesting, human, & true story to be heard...guess I will move on to one the real biographical movies about White next.",1311984000,4,1305,4.76
3871621,5,B00283PUSY,"This is one of my favorite films. Edward Hogg is in the same league as Dinero and Brando. One of the most amazing performances I have ever seen in my fifty-six years. The strange editing and filming adds to the movie as much as the weird soundtrack. I first saw the film on the Sundance Chanel and as I watched it unfold, each minute became more and more enthralling. Carrie Fisher's role is nothing less than incredible. I was not sure at first it was her. I thought she had given up acting. I can't wait until the director's cut is made available because the Sundance channel showed an edited version of the film. The asylum scene is more real than the one in ""One Flew Over The Cucoos Nest"" as far as it's depiction of such a hospital. I have seen this movie at least five times and I am blown away by it each time. They still make 'em like they use to.",1305676800,10,856,4.193939393939394
3871622,4,B00283PUSY,"If you happened to catch this film around release, you're probably like me and wondered when, if ever, it would find its way to DVD.

First of all, the film is shot in an eerie off color, and the camera work alone makes it worth seeing again. The scenes are distinctively separated with long pauses, I think maybe indicative of the flashes and long pauses that probably accompany a mind strung out on inhalants. These pauses are noticeably disturbing at first, and I wondered if maybe it had been poorly edited. But as the film unfolds, and the primary character gets deeper into the mess of his life, they change tone, speed up, and give the viewer the feeling that things are happening faster and faster - spinning out of control.

I think most will find the beginning of the film to feel slow and almost methodical in its plotting, but as it progresses it just keeps building and building to a climax that you know you probably won't want to see...

Then the ending.... Well, I won't spoil it at all. Chances are few people saw this at release. Let's just say it was wild enough and strange enough that I knew I had to see it again.

Definitely not a film for everyone, but if you live in or around the Appalachia mountains, you will both be put off by the stereo-types, while at the same time know you live 30 minutes away from people just like this...

I dunno.... Giving it four stars provided they haven't changed too much from the original release.",1302134400,3,1456,4.458646616541353
3871623,1,B00283PUSY,This movie is horrible.  The only thing about Jesco White that is truly portrayed in this movie is his name!!  They have how his father was killed wrong and the ending well all I have to say is wow what the hell is that about??  Horrible horrible movie.  I say if your a fan of Jesco White then watch the Dancing Outlaw Documentaries and The Wild and Wonderfull Whites of West Virginia if you want the TRUE story of Jesco White.  This movie was a waste of 2 hours.,1300665600,4,464,4.168539325842697
3871624,5,B00283PUSY,"Received this quickly after ordering. Was in excellent shape and although we haven't watched it yet, we have a connection to one of the actors in it, and am sure it will be a hit.  Have watched other shows regarding this story, and all I can say is:, ""some people never cease to amaze me.""  Thanks!",1416182400,,298,4.303571428571429
3871625,5,B00283PUSY,"I came across this movie by accident and was mesmerized from beginning to end. Edward Hogg was magnificent in the main role and I'm wondering where is he in other films? Of course, most mainstream American movies these days aren't of the caliber his talent deserves. Carrie Fisher was unexpected but cannily cast and brilliant herself in the supporting role. While some have criticized the movie for its departure from reality, I've lived with persons demonized by mental illness and alcohol or drugs and the Jekyl and Hyde insanity Hogg portrayed was frighteningly true to life. Someone said the characters were dehumanized? Missed the point--their lives became derailed by their own destructive compulsions. What role did that critic think the narration served? I say kudos to all involved, director, writer, production, cast, and crew. A little known masterpiece.",1416096000,2,866,5.282608695652174

3871627,5,B00283PUSY,"I know now that this movie is very loosely based on the life of Jesco White, the ""Dancing Outlaw"", but I had no idea who he was (and was actually happy to discover that he is still very much with us), so I had no expectations of historical accuracy.  This is a powerful, cathartic movie- it literally made me vomit. And cry. I cried a lot. Not a happy movie, but it beautifully, lovingly, lyrically portrays poverty, pain, suffering, religion, salvation, and madness in a largely forgotten part of this country. The black-and-white documentary style was moody and stunning, and maybe not accurate, but real.  And the music and dancing were splendid.
It feels strange to say that I loved it, but this movie had a profound effect on me. I know I will watch it again- preferably not alone. It's almost 2:00 AM, and I can't sleep...",1405987200,,828,4.587837837837838
3871628,3,B00283PUSY,"I'm not familiar with the true story of Jesco White. (But I will be soon.) So on viewing the film, I was happy with the portrayal of the dark side of life in the backwoods of Appalachia. Not knowing the true story didn't ruin things for me, and I truly enjoyed the film.

But...

If you're going to do a lot of research about Southern Appalachia and try to make the film as true to life as possible, it's unforgivable that Jesse repeatedly refers to one person as ""y'all."" Y'all is ALWAYS plural, and is only used when talking to more than one person.  To beat it all, I've had outsiders laugh at me and say it doesn't matter.  But it DOES matter if you want true accuracy.  ""Y'all"" is a contraction of ""You"" and ""All.""  You all.  Just like ""Youse guys.""  Would you call one person ""Youse guys?""  I'll wager not.

For instance:

* When Jesse talks to the fat man about his tattoos, he calls the man ""y'all."" No matter how fat a guy is, he's still one person. Jesse
should call him ""you.""

* When Jesse is talking to his dead father in heaven, he actually calls his father ""y'all!"" Best I can recollect, the man has/had ONE father.

This issue probably does not bother non-natives much, but it made me disrespectful of this director's work. Too bad the chosen film location was in Croatia. There was nobody around to correct this glaring ignorance of the vernacular.

Hope y'all enjoy this here review.",1396310400,4,1401,4.421875

Edward Hogg's portrayal of Jesco White is chilling, and the supporting cast, which includes the recently deceased Carrie Fisher, is superb.
