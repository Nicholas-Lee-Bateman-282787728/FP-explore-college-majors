8747619,3,B01AKE9KJ2,"Charlie watched her pro wrestler dad die in the ring, was raised by wrestlers and is now in the middle of an end of the world zombie extinction level event. From Parts Unknown: Fight Like a Girl! is that kinda movie.

This movie is based on director Daniel Armstrongs (MurderDrome) time in the video game industry, specifically a failed wrestling game project. There are a lot of shout outs toEvil Dead 2 in here, as this film aspires beyond its small budget to be an AustralianShaun of the Dead, except, you know, with pro wrestlers.

While originally shot in 2006 and 2007, the film sat on the shelf until Armstrong's later work got known. Over the following years, attempts to finish the movie were made. At one point, the director's car was destroyed by a drunk off-duty police officer and the insurance money was just enough to allow shooting to continue. Finally, in 2014, after the success ofMurderDrome, shooting and editing wereboth finally finished.

This is a movie that's not afraid to be beyond goofy and silly. It's not perfect by any means, but it's a fun take on the genre and most of the cast trained to be actual wrestlers, which is pretty cool. There's plenty of gore and one scene that legitimately made me laugh when the zombie personal assistant kept trying to find the exact right pose and had to keep pulling her body into position.",1535500800,,1356,4.665271966527197

Do you like sci-fi horror movies about wrestling or zombies or mutton chops or mad scientists or midgets?  Then this movie is for you!",1511568000,,388,4.579710144927536

8747623,3,B01AKE9KJ2,"Brain (Trevor Wight) steals the proverbial florescent green liquid from a military zombie institute. They are nano-bots that he plans on using to make an addictive fight game. A spill causes his boss to become a super strong homicidal maniac. As this spreads, Charlie (Jenna Dwyer) her co-workers and other ""professional"" wrestlers are the only ones who can stop them.

The film was designed to be campy. About midway through there was a ""groovy"" homage to Bruce Campbell as his on screen persona was utilized by a man armed with a fire extinguisher. I caught a line from ""Independence Day"" and a few from ""Unforgiven""  but didn't know if they were intentional. It is sometimes hard to tell homage scenes without a director's commentary.

Charlie fell down a lot during the film, sometimes for comedic value. When she wasn't falling down she was practicing falling down. I liked Brain's T-shirt, ""Jesus is Coming. Look Busy."" Choreographed fight scenes shouldn't be run in slow motion when it shows a person falling down before they get hit unless you do it for camp value, but then make it obvious.

Not for everyone type of film. camp/cult/grindhouse
