8338314,5,B000MPO5VI,"I watched this several times from 10-14 or somewhere along those lines. We still had a VCR, so I could. However, with things being as they are, it was difficult to watch any VHS without it getting eaten. I do remember loving it, from the music to the story. I loved the end credits, and Suki's transformation. I'll never forget what she said ""Not just a bear, Sebastian; a Star Bear!"" This is one of the best movie's I've seen that came from before my time, and it is definitly one that needs to be brought to DvD, before it's too late. Five out of five stars for this incredible movie.",1306022400,3,586,4.288288288288288
