8553434,5,B00ALY1AWC,"Will Hay's name (at least in America) is not as well recalled as Laurel & Hardy or W.C. Fields. This is not to say that their brands of humor were similar; they were not; the point being that lovers of good comedy ought to consider discovering for themselves this brilliant artist. As a writer and deliverer of long-winded dialogue, Hay stands in a select circle. The joke is always on him as he stumbles and blusters his way through one catastrophe after another. Remarkable is the sheer memory of the man for retaining improbably long recitations and nonsensical jabber. Just to look at his mug is enough to start the body shaking with amusement. What we in the states called vaudeville, the Brits called the music hall, and some of the keenest wits on either side of the Atlantic emerged from such training grounds. Once exposed to the madcap Will Hay, his name will be less forgotten by one more person.",1367712000,3,907,4.6397515527950315
