Living in what some would see as a seaside idyll; they exist in a hand to mouth way, barely being able to access the basics for survival. The main character is Stanley and he is the sort of lovable loser who just won't give up.

Then one day he discovers a flyer for an International tournament for handball in Bavaria. They have never heard of the game but see it as a one way ticket to Europe and a better life. So they set out to form a team, learn the rules and learn how to play. The path is a rocky one, with a fair few laughs and a fair bit of heartbreak too.

Now I have seen rave reviews for this film - which is why I got it - however, it is far from the show stopper it is claimed. It is very well made and the actors all do an excellent job. There are a couple of `wtf' moments - but that is forgivable. The elephant in the room with this though is illegal migration and the idea that a ticket to Europe or `the West' is a panacea for all ills, the beauty of Sri Lanka etc is just ignored - and this film more than propagates the myth.

As a piece of entertainment it works very well as a piece of serious social comment it is more of a puff piece and lets itself down a bit for it.",1440028800,,1287,3.8636363636363638
