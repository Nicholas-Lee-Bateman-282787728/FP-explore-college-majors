3950920,3,B002M3JJEG,"The series is okay. If you're into mythology, you should enjoy it enough. I did. I wish they had focused on other gods, especially Poseiden! I also thought a two part Odyssey episode was unnecessary. I want more. Also, the gods look nothing like I've imagined. Hades looks like a creeper. I don't know why he would look worse than the other gods. He was the first-born of the gods swallowed by their father. Why does he look like a homeless man? The information is great though. It's fun relearning about these myths again. In the end, I would recommend it.",1483574400,6,557,4.524752475247524

3950923,2,B002M3JJEG,"They did a pretty good job with greek mythology, but were horrible when it came to northern European mythology (Odinism) or also known as Asatru. Thor was not the only northern European god there was many others, on this show they are making it out like he is the only one.  They also state that there is no writing of the northern European gods other then some runes, which is false. There is the poetic edda and prose edda which are basically the bible of Odinism.",1480118400,,466,4.4186046511627906

3950925,1,B002M3JJEG,"I didn't expect perfect cinematography...thank goodness for I would've been sorely disappointed.  What I did expect, however, was that these so-called experts who are being interviewed would at least have enough depth to them to recognize the psycho-spiritual aspects of these lovely myths.  Instead they try to explain how the stories could possibly be real which makes the whole production worthless.",1478822400,,402,5.573770491803279

3950988,4,B002M3JJEG,Trinie Dalton: We do not buy these DVDs to really be told the truth about myths that are fake but to be entertained and they do that in some senses. 4 stars for at least trying to tell the truth with myths?,1456012800,,206,3.9285714285714284
3950989,4,B002M3JJEG,I bought this for my cousin. She loves this program on the history channel. Great price.,1455494400,,88,4.5625
3950990,3,B002M3JJEG,"I ordered this set with excitement and enthsiasm about showing a few episodes as a way of ending my mythology unit.  Thankfully, I watched the episodes before presenting them to my then 5th graders.  There are some very graphic and sexual scenes in several of the episodes.  I guess I missed the disclaimer that this was rated M!  Also, there was a great deal of repitition which totally spoils it for me.

I haven't watched these since my screening!!",1455321600,,451,4.658227848101266
3950991,3,B002M3JJEG,My students love this over dramatic connection to Homer's Odyssey.  And it's amazing what they remember if you need to teach in short time restraints.,1453680000,,150,5.0

3950995,4,B002M3JJEG,I love mythology. This was pretty good in it's narrating with a few things missing or not providing enough depth into the actual history of the mythology so be forewarned. Do your own research and sit back and be entertained.,1444521600,,225,4.65

3951032,5,B002M3JJEG,"Great set, even with the repetition for the television commercial breaks.  The violence is CG, but may be a bit much for the younger kids.  Perfect for high school on up.",1426291200,,170,4.451612903225806
3951033,4,B002M3JJEG,"I love this series, as it is one of the only series that truly focuses on the stories of the gods. It is very in depth, stays close to the myths of the people and things told within this series, and focuses greatly on using experts to attest to the truth of these stories. As an author of Split From Earth, I can attest to what I truly believe about greek mythology and I believe that this is a well done tv series.",1424476800,,415,4.0120481927710845
3951034,3,B002M3JJEG,The production values are a bit lacking and there's a great deal of crossover from one episode to the next. I'd hoped for more. :-(,1424390400,,131,4.28
3951035,5,B002M3JJEG,"If you liked the History Channel before they got that Ancient Alien crap and American Pickers, than this is perfect for you. It harkens back to a time when the channel actually cared about the history they were portraying.
The set itself is absolutely fantastic if you like or even love mythology. It brings in historians from across the country to discuss and analyze myths (Greek primarially), their significance in Antiquity, and why they still hold promance today. It even goes so far as to connect the myths with reality by presenting recent and truly amazing archiological finds. This is probably one of the best things History Channel has done with the ancient world, and is always an interesting and enlightening watch.",1423612800,4,727,4.967213114754099
3951036,4,B002M3JJEG,If you are into this there are many details not covered in mainstream retellings. My boyfriend loves them.,1422921600,,106,4.944444444444445

3951066,1,B002M3JJEG,Horrible editing.  There's so much flashing and jumping around it makes this unwatchable.,1408924800,,89,5.846153846153846
3951077,3,B002M3JJEG,"Yes, you will learn SOME mythological details.  Just enough to interest you into doing some real research on your own.  Which, I think, is shameful.  A History Channel production should exhaust all of the extant knowledge we have on each of these characters, gods, monsters, etc.  Present all of the literary facts and theories bouncing around academics' heads.

No, you will not be visually enthralled.  The images are repeated.  The ominous tone gets old fast.  The acting is not great.  One of the reasons, possibly, is that there is not much to act out.  The topics should have been covered in depth.  In such a way that both the layman and academic would be thrilled.  Instead, this is appropriate for kids.  Maybe.  Kids you think are not smart enough to handle more info.

DO NOT BUY THIS.  Is it worth a rent?  No.  Not at these prices.  The best thing you can do is wait for it to air on TV.  If you do not have cable, rent it from the local library.

Instead, check out these excellent works on mythology:

1) Mythology: the Illustrated Anthology of World Myth & Storytelling by C. Scott Littleton
2) Don't Know Much About Mythology by Kenneth C. Davis
3) Tolkien's Ring by David Day
4) The Greek and Roman Myths by Philip Matyszak
5) The Fairies in Tradition and Literature by Briggs
6) The World Guide to Gnomes, Fairies, Elves & Other Little People by Thomas Keightley

You WILL NOT be disappointed.  Some of these you can get on Amazon for less than an episode of this series!!!",1406160000,3,1492,4.543396226415094
3951078,3,B002M3JJEG,"The History Channel's series on ancient gods of Europe and the Mediterranean with focus on: Beowulf, Tolkien's monsters, Thor, Medusa, Perseus, Odysseus, Zeus, Hercules, Hades and the Minotaur.

Graphics bring some life to the subject matter and provide a movie-like quality. Scholar's provide commentary and historical background to each myth, making frequent reference to Christianity:

*Beowulf's final self-sacrifice while slaying the dragon (satan), and Jesus' sacrificial death.

*Rhea hiding Zeus, and Jesus' refuge in Egypt from Herod/baby Moses' placement in the ark.

*Hercules' suffering, sacrifice and resurrection as a god.

*Tolkien's Gandalf the Grey, becoming Gandalf the White after his sacrificial death and resurrection.

*Jesus destroying Hades in the Book of Revelation.

The theology behind the above is woeful, as ignorant as those at Lystra in Acts 14.8-18.

Interesting facts are English words and sayings we have inherited from these myths, e.g.: the god Atlas and 'having the world on one's shoulders'; the clue (yarn ball) Theseus used to find his way out of the labyrinth; Thursday in honour of the god Thor; typhoon from the god Typhon; Toxic, from toxo (Gk.bow) and Hercules poison arrows; Sisyphean (an impossible task) inspired by the fate of Sisyphus under Hades.

At three DVDs there is a lot of material for the price.",1405209600,,1354,5.40952380952381

3951081,5,B002M3JJEG,"Currently, I am taking a mythology class.  These episodes were worth the money to help in understand the readings for my course.  There are of course variations to each myth but it was a good basis for visual and auditory learners.",1401840000,,231,4.609756097560975
3951082,5,B002M3JJEG,"They cover the myth and evidence and are very well done. I like them because they give me context around the story of Jesus and how humans relate to religion.

3951086,4,B002M3JJEG,"Its stays pretty darn close with the true Greek Mythology. I loved the Medusa story and the Hercules story, what I didn't like about the Hercules story was that they tried to portray Hercules (at the end) to Jesus. Its not even remotely close to Jesus.

3951130,1,B002M3JJEG,"I came to the Clash of the Gods late (long after it originally came out), and looking for some additional video to supplement my university lectures on mythology I decided to purchase it. I had no illusions about the likely flaws in the production (in other words, I assumed it would not be state-of-the-art cinema), but I hoped it would be better than students listening to a talking head. Unfortunately, this aspect was worse than I expected. It basically consists of an actor with his beard, bare chest, animal fur clothes and ridiculous face make-up trying to have as godlike an expression as possible as the camera shows different angles of him standing and staring (the females were similar). The animated parts were also far from current computer abilities. Still, this was not enough of a flaw to cause me not to use the videos (we all know videos for classroom use are not likely to have the high level production values as those of Hollywood--though there are some that do). What was really, really, really bad about this collection was the attitude taken by the ""experts.""  Have they not heard of contemporary scholarship in mythology, such people as Joseph Campbell?  The views expressed were based on assumptions that long ago got overturned, assumptions that myths are nothing more than the beliefs of stupid, primitive people who used them to ""explain"" the mysteries around them because they were so ignorant. Again and again the experts give smirking comments about those ancient people actually believing the gods literally did various things. There appears to be no understanding of how stories, how the world of ""expression,"" how myths work. When discussing Zeus' affairs with women, the almost giggling commentary is how it is all his human-like desires for sex, and there is absolutely no suggestion that it might ""symbolize"" something, that it might work as a literary representation of truths beyond ""explanation.""  This initial video on Zeus, by the way, simply ends by saying he was defeated by Christ and the new religion, with absolutely no suggestion that the Romans had long ago lost any real faith in Zeus (who, by the way, was not as all powerful or separated from the other gods as suggested). I would remind the experts in these videos that in the world of academia and scholarship the Bible is considered a mythology (which is not a put down but praise, as myths are expressing the highest truths). Myths are not bad science; myths are not science at all.  And while they do interact with history, they are not meant to be bad history either. They are a form of expression that embraces truths beyond those of science and logic. Since it's obvious the videos are mainly presented by those with a Christian background, I suggest they look at their own mythology and see how it could also be reduced to ridicule in the same unenlightened way these other myths have been.  If you are looking for a good discussion of mythology, purchase the set of videos where Bill Moyers interviews Joseph Campbell. It has its flaws, but it is far superior to this mess.",1374710400,35,3086,4.837121212121212

I love to read about the clashes between the Greeks and the Trojans in the epic story of the Trojan War. Of course one of the most interesting stories is about the gods and goddess who would either side with Hector of Troy or, support Achilles of the Greeks in their mighty battle over Helen of Troy. I also liked reading about Zeus, and the powerful Olympian gods, with their petty, and jealous behavior, (Zeus cheated on his wife Hera every chance he got), and she made Heracles pay for Zeus infidelities. Over all, the shows tried to hard to show this side of the gods and goddess. While the story line was interesting, the acting was terrible. The camera angles used here changed so many times in a minute, it made your  head swim. I would have to say, after watching many of the History Channels fine productions, this may have been the worse one I have watched. It was more like viewing a movie through a strobe light then a camera. Cutting back and forth to a scowling actor trying to look like Zeus. Poor production qualities. Sorry History Channel, love you, but this one didn't come off right.",1358899200,3,1194,4.502304147465438

I thought it was surprising that there were some stories in the legends that seem similar to a few stories in Christianity. There was a story that Zeus had sent a massive flood in order to destroy all humans on Earth and only two humans survived on an ark. I was amazed because this is very similar to the Christian story about Noah's Ark. Before, I thought I already knew a lot about the Gods and Goddesses, but I never knew that in the beginning, they didn't all get along with each other. The war between the Titans and the Gods sounded like a horrific battle and the land where it was believed to have taken place still looks like it is still scarred to this day.
In conclusion, I think this is a very interesting show to watch and there are very interesting facts that I have never heard before.

I am always skeptical about The History Channel's offerings because they tend to have low production values, albeit they are plenty informational.

I was so impressed with the stylish presentation of ""Clash of the Gods"" after watching the ""Medusa"" episode that I immediately purchased the whole season. The episodes are extremely informational and I learned a whole lot more about each topic than I thought existed. The visual experience and amount of informational content is top-notch in quality, and while having the Blu-ray version isn't necessary, it does look sharp and crisp. With the exception of occasionally funny looking costumes for the Titans and Zeus, the art direction is slick and stylistic. Not only does this series tell the stories of the myths, it relates them as much as possible to reality, and there are some fascinating things to be learned.

Some of the choices though, were surprising. Medusa, not a God, was included. Her story is timeless & important, but found it out of place in the series for the Gods. If they wanted to include female mythology, they were many I would have wanted to see.
  Poseidon was featured in the story of Medusa, but He is so important, as a God Himself. His story would have been a better choice, and Medusa could have been included in His tale. The Minotaur, Beowolf & Tolkein's monsters were also out of place in this collection. Even my beloved Odysseus could have been included in Poseidon's tale, instead of being separate.
  We could have have other Gods, Dionysus, Aries & Apollo, who would have been excellent choices!

I come at this with a classical perspective (I'm a Latin teacher) and my one serious qualm was that the production did not address the fact that there are usually several versions of the same myth; there is in fact no one canonical version, contrary to what this series implies.  Different authorities give different versions of the stories.  But I think this is a relatively minor proviso considering how much the series offers.",1327190400,10,662,4.681034482758621
3951193,4,B002M3JJEG,"Clash of the Gods has horrible acting, cheap special effects, and uses the same footage over and over and over. But in spite of those very considerable flaws it is a very good show. Each episode focuses on either a deity or a legend, telling the basic story with the major emphasis being on both violence and sex. Ancient myths are usually told today in such a sanitized way that they are boring, but the truth is that those old tales are filled to the brim with extreme sex and violence. When a show tells the stories without shying away from the sex and violence the stories are much more entertaining and meaningful.

I am a huge fan of Beowulf, but I learned a few things about the legend from this show that I didn't already know. I am also a huge fan of Lord of the Rings, and likewise the Tolkien episode of Clash of the Gods revealed some things about Tolkien's mythology that I did not understand previously. This show has helped me to understand the Odyssey and Iliad like I never have before, and Thor the Norse god of thunder is a totally bad dude.

3951194,5,B002M3JJEG,"I find the main review for this series to be exceptionally harsh, and overly negative. Beyond that, it seems to miss the point. Clash of the Gods is, if nothing else, an exceptional educational tool - weaving deftly between complicated mythology and historical fact and joining it all together in 45 minute segments. The point of the show is to not merely retell the myths, although that sort of thing plays a significant role, but to provide examples of how stories are rooted in the beliefs, hopes, fears, triumphs and failures of humanity as well as how all of it is shaped by History. When there were no movies, or television shows - when science was in its infancy and the world was a largely terrifying place, people needed to have reasons for the things that occurred during their daily lives. They needed entertainment too, and these tales served them very well as both. Finding inspiration in reality to create something much larger than themselves in order to give their lives a greater meaning that they felt was otherwise beyond their reach.

Acting is not the focus here. Indeed, you could hardly call non-speaking roles, with narration explaining them ""acting."" But the visuals are better than merely being told what the story is, and I do like the narration. I think it adds to the overall experience of the show, instead of detracting from it. It is far too easy to label something as ""derivative"" or say it's been done before. You would be hard pressed to find any concept that hasn't been done before. Execution is key, and the History Channel really seems to excel at this. The interviews from scholars, historians, and professors really give interesting background to tales many have heard before.

The Tolkien episode serves more to show how one can create their own mythology, in a way that can tie it back into the overall themes of the show. Here again, the main review missed the point. I suspect that what the reviewer found boring is having to do the review. But I really liked the show and give it my highest recommendation. 5 Stars.",1311379200,10,2061,4.722222222222222

3951196,2,B002M3JJEG,"Seldom, if ever, have I awaited the production of a documentary series as much as I did this one. And seldom, if ever, have I been more disappointed with the final outcome than I have with this series. While I am not a serious student of Greek Mythology, I have read the majority of the myths over the last 45 years or so and as I watched the series I kept saying to myself, ""that's not right"", ""I don't remember that"", ""where did that come from"" and ""What's with all the bogus tie-in's to christianity""?

First, let me state that the visuals and the production were OK from a technical aspect. The CG work was not state-of-the-art, but not all that bad, (other than the World Snake), and better than many of the made for TV movies on the SyFy channel. The choice of actors playing the parts, not horrible, not great, but not horrible either. Zeus taking his hood off and shots of his glaring eyes, over and over again. Athena as she stared out of the camera in rage, over and over again. The rehashing of stock footage throughout the series was just a bit annoying also. The choice of the actor playing Thor however was horrible. Let's see, we needed to find an older actor, (say late 30's early 40's, a prime specimen of rugged manhood), to play a huge, buff, super strong, redheaded guy with a healthy red beard who wears an magic belt and iron gauntlets, (you know, the big cuddly guy the size of a bus, who's quick to anger, quick to forgive, loves puppies, hates giants), yah, .............you, you there, young fellow, you look like you work out between cappuccino's, not too buff but that's OK you're big enough for our budget. Hummm, you can't grow a beard? Well that's OK to.  Your hair color isn't right either but close enough for government work, do you want to be in a movie? Sorry you only get a belt and a loin cloth, no magic gauntlets or hammer worthy of naming; not in the budget.

As I stated earlier, I am not extremely well read in Greek mythology. I am however fairly well read in Norse myth.

Some of my points of contention follow:

The ""Thor's Oak"" or Donor's Oak as it is known, ""was used for human sacrifice to Thor"". It is my understanding that the majority of the animal sacrifices were to Thor, Odin, and Freyr. All of the accounts I can find state that while it was used for human sacrifice these were mostly made to Odin & Freyr, not Thor.

The statement that, ""The Dark Ages were a very violent time"". That's about as ambiguous a statement as you can get. What ""peace loving, KUM BA YAH singing"", times were they referring to? The tunnel of love Roman Colosseum times? The compassionate Ukrainian harvests of the 1930's imposed by Stalin time? The wonderful and heart wrenching Aztec times? The love fest of the Assyrian conquest times? How about the wise and benevolent rule and policies of Saddam Hussein? The Black Death? Nuclear War? You get the picture. I'm not sure how to break this to the ""experts"" at the History channel but, all of history is a violent time. I'd also be willing to bet that the average villager living north of the Rhine-Danube border was safer than ones in the south after Rome fell. The ""Dark Ages"" were not all that dark or at least no darker than the Late Roman Period or the Early Medieval period.

Freya is not Thor's sister as they stated, she is Freyr's twin sister.

Referring to the Sagas and Edda as just ""stories"", I find rather demeaning to the thousand years or so that the Icelanders and other groups preserved these brilliant and irreplaceable works of Northern European literature.

Referring to Ragnarok as the end of the Viking Age, (as they implied by its being replaced with Christianity), is a bit much. Symbolically it represents the cycle of life, death, rebirth and the return of the Sun. Sometimes it is hailed as the return of Balder, the ""Shining One"". Granted, their may have been some christian influence regarding this Edda, but basically it represents the turning of the wheel of the year and the rebirth of Spring from Winter.

Thor is not the head of, leader of or the inspiration for the Berserkers! They are and always have been Odin's.

Why was Odin depicted with both eyes? Even an absolute novice to Norse studies knows he sacrificed one of his eyes for knowledge.

The statement was made that the worlds tree, ""Yggdrasil, holds the Three Realms of the universe"". I could have sworn that there were several more than that. That might be because they are called the Nine Worlds of Yggdrasil, and they are, (in no special order):

1. Menn (humans): Manheimr (see Migarr).
2. Aesir (gods): saheimr (see sgarr).
3. Vanir (gods): Vanaheimr.
4. Jtnar (giants): Jtunheimr.
5. lfar (elves): lfheimr.
6. Nir (corpses, the other world of the dead): Hel.
7. Svartlfar (Dark Elves, Dvergar, Dkklfar): Svartlfaheimr.
8. Primordial element of Ice: Niflheimr.
9. Primordial element of Fire: Muspellsheimr.

I find it interesting that until I watched this ""documentary"" I had never heard that Thor had ever presented himself as a child when he went fishing for Jrmungandr. Where did this child thing come from? He drank Hymers ale and devoured his cattle as Thor. He butchered Hymers Bull for the bait he used as Thor and got on Hymers boat and rowed out to sea as Thor.

Here is a quote from another reviewer on this particular installment, by Christopher Long in, ""DVD Town"", ""Here's a firm rule. If you go through an entire episode about Thor and do not use the word ""Mjolnir""...... you are not worthy"". Wish I would have thought of that one. For those of you who do not know what Mjlnir is, and you would not if you depended on this series to tell you, it is the name of Thor's enchanted Hammer.

The best thing about the Thor story was that Mjlnir was not depicted as some SiFi, grotesquely huge hammer of ridicules proportions. This was a plus.
Another plus: No hideously offensive and non-historical winged or horned helmets, (although one of the giants might have had one on).

Nuff said. With what I know about Norse mythology I find it very hard to accept much of anything that was presented on the Greek Gods as having much creditability. This series was only for show and rushed to production to coincide with the remake of, ""Clash of the Titans"". The phrase's ""ride the wave"" & ""make a quick buck"", come readily to mind.

All and all, visually not real bad however, the ""facts"" which the series is based are totally disregarded by the writers, director and or producer. I have no problem with this approach in a work of fiction however; this was supposed to be a documentary. I, (and many others I know and correspond with), were extremely disappointed with the end result of this History Channel production. Until the so called History Channel redeems itself, stick with established written works on Mythology. The only reason I am rating the series at a 2 star rating is because the effects were slightly better than average.

The narrator put me to sleep - but the Greek myths are supposed to be exciting! It's not supposed to be like watching birds with David Attenborough! Awful conception - if you want to put your kids off ancient religions forever, here's a good start.",1303776000,4,390,4.666666666666667

I was very impressed with the way the stories were presented.  I did not get to see it all.  I am looking forward to finishing the program.,1300060800,2,289,4.277777777777778
3951199,5,B002M3JJEG,"First of all, let me say like others have, this series isn't without it's mistakes. Most of the errors are with the Thor segment, but a majority of the Greek stories are close.

All of the episodes are must see segments. The highlights are ""The Minotaur"", ""Zeus"" & ""The Odyessy"". Greek mythology stories will vary here & there depending on the source of the material. The mentioned shows are close to the stories, and having the other experts making comments are fun, making it seem that the stories are really part of history.

The Norse parts, ""Thor"" & ""Beo-Wolf"", aren't bad too, with ""Beo-Wolf"" being the better of the two. Now I'm not as taught on Norse as the Greek stories, but even I know that the Thor segment was seriously flawed. All starts with Thor's lack of flowing red hair & beard to match.

All in all, if you want some entertainment, this is a must-buy. I hope they eventually do a season two.",1299542400,4,911,4.509090909090909

3951201,5,B002M3JJEG,"This DVD set is a fantastic teaching tool.  I teach 9th grade and the 2 sections about Odysseus and his journey match our textbook exactly.  It is a wonderful visual review for my students and helps explain the chronology in an effective way.  Also, the section on Hades is helpful, as it explains how control was divided, and the three ""levels"" of the underworld, as it reinforces subject matter I have already taught.  This set is a bargain for only about $30.00.",1293753600,30,465,4.634146341463414
3951202,1,B002M3JJEG,"I thought it was HORRIBLE!!!

We wanted to see a documentary on Greek Mythology. We were highly disappointed by how the myths represented did not actually follow the classic stories.

History Channel should be ashamed to have their name on this series.",1282867200,10,252,4.976190476190476
3951203,2,B002M3JJEG,"The production quality wasn't bad but the information presented was pathetically biased and incorrect. The slant about how Jesus killed all the old gods was stupid and unprovable. Then they got several details horribly wrong. Just one instance is where they say that Freya was Thor's sister. It takes about 3 minutes of research to see that there is absolutely NO grounds to say this as they were from separate tribes of Gods and had different parents. Last I checked you had to have the same parents to be brother and sister. If they would pull one easily falsified ""fact"" out of their butts like that then it is a little hard to swallow the other parts. Also, the section on Hades was pretty lame. Apparently in Christian mythology Hades was god of the underworld/place of the dead before Christ despite the fact that their doctrine was that there was only one God EVER! The ties between pre-christian and Christian mythologies is contrived and poorly argued.",1282435200,14,961,4.795180722891566

3951205,4,B002M3JJEG,A docu-drama of sorts.  I enjoyed the insight of those presenters and the clarification on various points that I may have forgotten from High School.  I did find the acting a bit stiff even for a Documentary but it accomplished the task.  This would be a good intro for a freshman in HS who is not sure what to make of the Greek Gods of old.  It may help inspire them to read and learn more. I would buy again as a gift.,1272844800,25,420,4.024096385542169
