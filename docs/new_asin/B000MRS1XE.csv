8171501,4,B000MRS1XE,"""That 70's Show"" was great entertainment, especially for those of us who were teenagers during that era, and my four star rating is not a knock on the show. However, the cost of the first five seasons individually is less than what people are generally asking for this set, which is nothing more than the first 5 season DVD sets bundled together. There are no extra features. My opinion is, unless the total price is less than 125 dollars, either buy the sets individually or hold out until all eight seasons have been released and see if they come out with some kind of collector's edition like they did with ""Friends"". Those tend to be great bargains per season, plus you generally get bonus footage and all kinds of extras. This show is ripe for that kind of treatment. I'm giving 5 stars for the 5 seasons themselves, and 2 stars for the prevailing price of the five season bundle. I round up, and thus my four star rating.",1170720000,,927,4.491124260355029
8171502,5,B000MRS1XE,"The fact that this show reminds me so much of my life in High School in the Seventies is very embarrassing. That being said... This show is one of the funniest ever on TV. Full of cameos from 70's TV shows, full of references to prevalent illegal activities popular in the era, and of course full of teenage ""doofusses"", who think they are fooling their parents.

So true to the era, so funny. If you remember it much differently, you probably weren't there!",1170201600,,458,4.518072289156627
