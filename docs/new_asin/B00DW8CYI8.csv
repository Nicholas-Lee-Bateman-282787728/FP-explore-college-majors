Still a great night with Bryan and his awesome music.",1413417600,,228,4.3023255813953485
5861359,5,B00DW8CYI8,"This is one seriously talented performer. Just stripped back to the basics of guitar, piano, bit of mouth organ and a bagpiper but what a show. His songs strip back so well...and the voice just cuts through like no other. Watched this a few times now and am loving it.  If I could hold an audience's attention for a tenth of the time that Adams does I'd be stoked.

The audio and video quality are first rate too.",1403913600,,413,4.282051282051282
5861360,4,B00DW8CYI8,"Typically I don't watch the concert DVDs, but love having the live aspect playing through the entertainment center. I did watch parts of this one and found the rapid switching of camera angles tiresome. Too much of the footage is shot from behind Bryan, and when the camera finally focuses on him from the front it only stays for a second. I will continue to enjoy listening to the DVD, since I keep the cd of this tour in my car. While I don't highly recommend this DVD, I wouldn't discourage anyone who is a fan from adding it to their collection of his work. I'm happy to have it in mine, and really did love the acoustic aspect of this tour. It's always my preference to not have the distractions of a lot of production behind the artist drowning out the lyrics.",1400803200,2,766,4.363636363636363
5861361,5,B00DW8CYI8,I've seen pretty much every one of BA's concerts since the beginning of the 90's and I LOVED this one.  My all time favourite!  I was buying the album on the way out of the concert hall's parking lot and I am DEFINITELY buying the DVD!  I only wished it was available as a digital download so I could keep it on my devices!,1399161600,,323,4.015625
5861362,2,B00DW8CYI8,"I received the blu ray version as a gift someone else bought on Amazon. I had very high expectations about the concert and the performance. Sadly, I have to say that the result is very disappointing. If you look for a musical performance with a full band, songs with beautiful arrangements, this is not Bryan concert we all expect. Once again, a missed opportunity to produce a good concert.",1388016000,4,391,4.681159420289855
5861363,5,B00DW8CYI8,"If you are even considering buying this blu-ray of Bryan Adam's acoustic performance at Sydney Opera House, don't hesitate. The sound resonates with crystal clear quality and you can hear the beautiful rasp in Bryan's voice ring clearly. The HD picture is awesome. Generally the stage is dark throughout with the lights directly on Bryan. It looks great. All the major hits are here. Highly recommended.",1387584000,6,403,5.121212121212121
5861364,5,B00DW8CYI8,"Just a heads up, this is a concert with just Adams on acoustic and the piano player.  Even with that, the performances are fantastic.  Certainly worth the buy.  Just wish we would eventually get a live concert with a full band!",1386633600,5,227,4.487804878048781

8598668,5,B00DW8CYI8,"Bryan's Bare Bones Tour was so different. I wasn't sure I would like this but it is now one of my favorites.  I love this up close and personal concert. I would love for him to do this again even though I am such a fan of Gary, Mickey and Keith.",1482710400,,245,3.803921568627451

8598675,3,B00DW8CYI8,"Good: Sound quality was great.  Bryan's voice was as good as ever.  The number of songs played along with song selection was impressive.

Bad:  The camera work was poor.  People were moving around with handheld cameras filming this so in most of the shots there was always a level of the camera rocking or shaking.  Also a few really odd zooming close ups of Bryan's mouth.  The editing was bad too.  There are 20-30 second stretches where you are looking at Bryan's back.

This Bluray looked like it was created by art students, not a professional filming company.",1430092800,,565,4.683673469387755
