7908186,1,B00000FDVH,"Don't waste your money on this ""family"" trifle. The storyline is very stupid and SO familiar: a girl loses her dog, the dog finds his way back, and runs into various encounters along the way. Its boring, stupid, and has nothing enjoyable. If you want a ""dog loses master"" film, then get the EXCELLENT Lassie movies made by MGM in the 1940s in breathtaking Technicolor.
Finally, the quality of the image is extremely poor. Its in EP, not SP mode, as if someone recorded this off of a local television station! The color is blurred and has very poor contrast, the image is so hazy its almost fog-like, and the audio quality is very poor even with the volume turned up to the loudest. Don't waste your time on this trifle. It was made on a very low budget and every second looks like it. It's so obscure that Leonard Maltin doesn't list this, and for good reason!",1071705600,,860,4.449367088607595
