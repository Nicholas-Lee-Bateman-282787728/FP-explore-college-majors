7949403,4,B00005OW0U,"Pride 6 was held on July 4, 1999 at the Yokohama Arena.
The first fight is between Lumax Cup, Shooto, Super Brawl 12 and Pride veteran Eagan Inoue and in his MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) debut pro wrestler from the Battlarts Carl Malenko. A solid match but it does get dull at times.
The second fight is between Pride veteran Daijiro Matsui and Extreme fighting, Japan Vale Tudo and UFC 17 veteran Carlos Newton. Excellent fight with little or any stalling.
The third fight is between Universal Vale Tudo 6 tournament winner, International Vale Tudo and UFC 15 veteran Carlos Barreto holds wins over Mikhail Illoukhine, Daniel Bobish , Paul Varelans and Kevin Randleman against IFC 1 tournament winner, WVC 5 tournament winner and AFC 3 tournament winner Igor Vovchanchyn. This was an interesting fight but dull.
The fourth fight is between Lumax Cup and Pride veteran Akira Shoji and UFC veteran & former King of Pancrase Guy Mezger. Good fight with a controversial ending.
The fifth fight is between UFC 8 finalist and IVC 1 tournament winner Gary Goodridge and in his MMA debut Naoya Ogawa. Another good fight with a controversial ending.
The sixth fight is between UFC Japan tournament winner and Pride veteran Kazushi Sakuraba and  Universal Vale Tudo, International Vale Tudo, Ultimate Brazil and Pancrase veteran Ebenezer Fontes Braga. Great fight with a excellent ending.
The main event is between WVC 3 tournament winner, UFC 14 & 15 tournament winner and Pride veteran Mark Kerr and Pride veteran Nobuhiko Takada. Good fight but it is not main event quality.
