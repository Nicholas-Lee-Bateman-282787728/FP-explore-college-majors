3544765,5,B001E0C4CC,We wouldn't have missed this inspiring tale! Excellent actors and good writing. Needs a wider distribution. Should be released for more than UK audiences.,1360454400,3,154,5.458333333333333
3544766,5,B001E0C4CC,"There are not too many films which accurately depict the personal lives of historical figures. Try as they may, secret human peculiarities which are more readily acceptable or at least tolerated in our present age, are seen as huge obstacles in years past. Case in point, this film called "" Einstein and Eddington "" is only now surfacing to the American public and according to this reviewer, has done a masterful job. The story itself centers on two men of Genius who lived at the beginning of the Tweneith century. The first is Arthur Eddington (David Tennant) the British Mathematician and astrophysicist and German scientist Albert Einstein (Andy Serkis, superb characterization). This film captures both the social and a bit of their personal lives before they became known to the world. Einstein is seen searching for answers to his theories concerning gravitational phenomenon and it's relationship to light. Eddington is captivated by the scientific contradictions of the Planet Mercury and Newtons calculations of its orbit. The result is the communication between The Englishman and the Swiss scientist, both of whom shrug off their nationalities in lieu of scientific truth. With Eddington dealing with his personal emotional ties to his secret admiration and love for his dear friend William Marston, (Patrick Kennedy), Einstein, deals with his wife Malava who confronts him with divorce, due to his illicit affairs. Both men are seen in their moments of contentment as well as dealing with their doubts and tragedies. All in all, the movie is a great triumph for both actors and a notable milestone for their accomplishment. Easilly recommended to anyone who would like to peek into the personal lives of two men who shook the world. ****",1271203200,8,1751,5.147368421052631
3544767,5,B001E0C4CC,"Just saw someone had incorrectly tagged this exciting historical drama by Peter Moffat about Einstein & Eddington, another scientist, as a documentary, so am here to say it is nothing of the sort -- it's a good biographical, historical drama of two scientists working on The Theory of Relativity at the start of WWI, Arthur Eddington, astrophysicist, in England, Einstein in Germany, trying to continue to communicate with each other during very trying times. Eddington discovered The Eddington Limit or The Eddington Luminosity of stars, and was instrumental in helping Einstein prove his famous theory. This film was made by HBO for the United Kingdom and very unfortunately has never aired here. Andy Serkis plays Einstein, and David Tennant Eddington.",1268956800,10,755,5.3
3544768,2,B001E0C4CC,"firstly I must say, I hate this movie because the actor who played Einstein was not very good-looking. For me, a great admirer of Einstein, he is the most handsome man on this planet, his eyes are the most attractive of all. Yet the actor spoiled the charm of Einstein had  by his overly big eyes. And his remarks in the film are not witty or insightful as the real Einstein's. For example, Einstein sat at the table with others, eating. Then he said, ""there's no such thing as aether. Light travels at constant speed."" So that's all about his discovery? the first thing to do is to mention some math!! without math you can never understand the principles of Einstein's theory thoroughly! although this is a film, not a schorlarly work, yet some math are necessary to give it a scientific atomsphere. In a nutshell, too little about science, too much about the person's life and events. Especially too many stuffs involved political issues (Both Eddington and Einstein)
Also, it made me feel very uneasy to hear Einstein speak British English. The actor definitely couldn't imitate Einstein's sonorous German-accented English.

A satisfactory film I think should show how Einstein thought, namely,  the thinking process,  or methods of thinking.

PS:at the end there should be a mentioning that Eddington's measurement was highly inaccurate.",1254614400,2,1341,4.995515695067264
3544769,4,B001E0C4CC,"This story turns on a critical historical event; without Arthur Eddington, it is quite possible that Albert Einstein's theories would have been ground into the dusts of obscurity by the juggernaut of mainstream academic belief systems, wartime politics, racism and the list goes on.  It is a story of moral heroism, of persistence and of great triumphs set in the bloodthirsty insanity of the first World War.

The acting is blissful. Andy Serkis as Einstein inhabits the role with a vibrant intensity that is engaging and electrifying; if you are an American, his performance is worth the purchase of a region-free DVD player (they've become more reasonable and more capable than you may remember).  David Tennant's Eddington is drawn with the pristine clarity that is becoming a hallmark of his work; haunting and riveting in the same breathless space.  Together (though they actually share the screen for only a moment) they are outstanding.

I am not quite as happy with the script ... or is it the editing? There is so much story to tell and such limited space to tell it. These are fully drawn characters, set in some of the most emotionally charged years in history. Their lives are impacted by WWI, their needs, their desires and their lust for the truth of the universe that lies so tantalizingly near, yet so far away.  Perhaps my problem is not with the gifted Peter Moffat but with the gods of the producing universe who decree that an audience attention span rarely exceeds 90 minutes.  A full two hours or more to build and shape this story would have been more than welcome.",1244678400,23,1589,4.798534798534798
8295811,5,B001E0C4CC,"It's a dramatic protrayal, to be sure, but it brings character to an Albert Einstein normally seen as dreary and scattered. Excentricity was his life blood, and it's shown wonderfully here. Eddington was overdone a bit, as he was not the teenage-girl-trapped-in-a-man''s-body he was depicted to have been, and the conflict between him and his contemporaries was explained understandably more than accurately. There's just too much stroy to tell. Any mind with historical references other than this will easily fill the gaps this leaves. Enjoy the human side.",1527120000,,558,5.3522727272727275
8295812,5,B001E0C4CC,Very informative.,1517184000,,17,8.0
8295813,5,B001E0C4CC,"I suspect it might be difficult to appreciate this movie for those who do not appreciate scientific thought, the quest for truth and the insatiable thirst called curiosity that cannot be but quenched. But, for those, who do appreciate science, this might be one of the most inspiring movies of all times. Eddington was one of the luminaries of astrophysics of his time. Therefore, saying that his work is forgotten is not appropriate. He was proven wrong, his theories were replaced by those of others with better understanding just like it ought to be in science.

In later life, Eddington was not as gracious as shown here, which might be his glorious time of life. Many years later, just as he proved that Einstein was right and Newton was wrong, Eddington himself was proven wrong and that the stellar S. Chandrashekhar was right. Eddington had ridiculed Chandra openly in a conference in one instance, regarding the idea of what came to be known as Chandrashekhar limit. In the end, Chandra was proven right by calculations of observation data with the use of computers, regarding the limits of white dwarfs, the evolution of stars, and the existence of black holes.",1512777600,,1171,4.884422110552764
8295814,5,B001E0C4CC,"Worth watching several times.  Perfect acting, directing, photographing, and music.  Really worth the high price from UK.  Interesting depiction of the prejudice both in Germany and England.  The new wonderful movie RACE shows the same sort of public horror.  The few minor errors in science are not worth worrying about.  The drama is more important than nit picking.  Especially loved seeing Einstein struggling with the math and needing help.  And the sadness of Eddington is perfectly shown when......no spoilers please!",1465862400,,524,5.4625
8295815,5,B001E0C4CC,Watched it once and had to own it as in all movies it had it's ups and downs but more ups. I can't get it out of my thoughts.,1448064000,,125,3.3448275862068964
8295816,5,B001E0C4CC,Remarkable rendition of a story that should be more known than it is. Both David Tennant and Andy Serkis merge seamlessly with their characters in a terrific performance.,1440979200,,170,5.107142857142857
8295817,5,B001E0C4CC,Just wonderful. Interesting part of history.  Both David Tenant and Andy Serkis  were excellent.,1425859200,,96,5.785714285714286
8295818,2,B001E0C4CC,"This film puts a soap-opera and melodramatic and highly fictionalized gloss on real events and people, creating absurd distortions of the historical record. Although Eddington was rumored to be a closeted homosexual, I very much doubt that he feverishly bicycled alongside the troop train that was carrying a man he was secretly in love with. Einstein did not get the inspiration for curved spacetime by almost being run over by speeding cars in Berlin. I could be wrong, but I also don't believe that Eddington wrote a letter to Einstein to Berlin during wartime asking about the orbit of Mercury, causing the latter to try to come up with a gravitational theory, or that he worked out Mercury's orbit on the floor of his Berlin flat with Max Planck. Tennant plays Eddington well, though with way too much angst -- and I couldn't stop thinking this was Stephen Colbert in his first major dramatic role. Serkis plays Einstein well, but it's not the real Einstein but rather the Nutty Professor Einstein  that most people carry around in their heads as an icon. The acting, costuming and production values are high in this film, deserving of at least a one-star bump, but too often the script has the characters make speeches to each other to clue the viewer in to what's happening intellectually and otherwise, and factually this is a piece of asinine drivel.",1388448000,,1359,4.832618025751073
8295819,5,B001E0C4CC,"I bought it for Tennant, but it was a really good movie.  While, like most docudramas, it was not necessarily 100% historically accurate, it did a great job telling the story.",1367452800,2,175,4.645161290322581
8295820,1,B001E0C4CC,"This is an odd mixture of fact and fiction. Some of the events are real, but Eddington did not prove that Einstein was right by showing the displacement of stars at a lecture. The stars would have been displaced anyway, but by a different amount, so it was necessary to actually measure the displacement, so the dramatic revelation in the DVD was impossible. A case of gilding the lily for dramatic purposes, but destroying the educational value in the process.
If a book made the same erroneous claims it would have been trashed by reviewers, and I see no reason to treat this any differently.",1363737600,6,594,4.666666666666667
