Yes, it is wordy but i think it fits the characters and the story.  Usually when i watch a film i can figure out the 3-4 possibilities of how the character will respond or what direction the film will go.  This flick was very unpredictable.  I think that in itself makes it worth watching.  Have fun.",1252108800,,478,3.968421052631579
7883753,4,6305128979,"This story about two friends who literally bleed the life out of another acquaintance for the location of a family fortune kept me very interested and guessing until the end.  Accusations, fabrications and confessions fly between the characters while the audience is told in flashback what truly happened between four so-called friends one night in Pateman's wood. Patrick Stewart's character has the unhappy duty of finding out who double-crossed him and killed his son. The trouble is that he has multiple suspects but only one bullet.
I wanted to see this film because I am a fan of both Patrick Stewart and Marc Warren, the latter of whom gives a stand-out performance as Vic, the brains of the operation. Warren's portrayal alone is one reason to see this movie.  I hope to see more from this talented actor in the future.",973296000,2,827,4.858156028368795
7883754,3,6305128979,"The only reason I went to the cinema to see this film is because I was in it!  (Very briefly)  However that was quickly forgotten as early as during the opening credits.  What an explosive beginning!  It is a very clever  story.  It flips backwards and forwards in time so it is not clear what is  going on until about two thirds of the way through.  Unfortunately it is  unnecessarily wordy, unrealisticly so.  But if you can bear that it is  worth sticking around until the end.  One of the highlights is Captain  Pickard LINEDANCING!  Though I wasn't looking at him, I was too busy trying  to see myself!  (My part was uncredited, big BOO HOO)",958003200,,646,4.439655172413793
