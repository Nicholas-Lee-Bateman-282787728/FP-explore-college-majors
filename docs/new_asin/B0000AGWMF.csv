1905872,5,B0000AGWMF,"A man and his wife and daughter are on their way to the Valley Inn, for a fun little getaway. They become hopelessly lost, ending up at the last house in the desert. The family is met there by Torgo, the bubble-thighed (like a grasshopper w/ elephantiasis), gibbering, hillbilly henchman of the mysterious ""Master"". Of course, rather than just leaving, our family decides to spend the night. Torgo gets too friendly with wifey and she slaps his fuzzy face. Meanwhile, the family's poodle ""Pepe"" has wandered outside to his doom. Hubby looks for his faithful canine, finding only a pile of black mattress-filler! The untold horror really begins when the Master rises from his slab in the nearby tomb! He's accompanied by six wives, dressed in atrocious white nightgowns. The women are not awake ten seconds before they start arguing! They can't decide whether to kill the whole family, or to spare the daughter or... After what seems like hours of inane bickering, the gals decide to fight each other, in what must be the most boring catfight ever filmed! They roll around in the sand, shaking and half-heartedly slapping each other. It's like watching a clownschool sorority induction party! Anyway, the Master decides to kill Torgo in another long, drawn out process of immense tedium. The family wanders around in the desert, unable to make any progress escaping, due to their total idiocy. So, they head back to the house of hellishness, only to be confronted by a golfball-eyed Master. Dad shoots him to no avail. This leads to the surprise / shock finale. MANOS is a movie written, produced, and directed by Harold P. Warren. Imagine Ed Wood's brain transplanted into the skull of a chipmunk. Now, give our Ed Wood chipmunk a lobotomy, a pad and pencil, fifty bucks, and a movie-camera. Given enough time, this Ed Woodized rodent would inevitably recreate the stunning masterpiece called MANOS THE HANDS OF FATE...",1082073600,8,1919,4.925925925925926
1905873,5,B0000AGWMF,"You don't know how bad a movie can be until you see Manos. I've seen a lot of bad movies during my life, bad actors, bad screenplays, bad effects, but none of that compares with Manos. Truly, so far, by far, this is the worst movie ever made. I can imagine a movie worst than this one, and if it exits, believe I won't see it.
One thing that I recommend, if you're going to see it, watch it alone the first time, then call your friends, wife, parents, whoever, and ask them to watch it, and enjoy the look on their faces, the expressions, everything. That's worth a lot,that is, if you dare to watch it again :-) .",1080604800,4,614,4.125
1905874,5,B0000AGWMF,"Here it is: the original uncut edition of ""MANOS"" The Hands of Fate. Manos is the ultimate Mystery Science Theater experiment, and I love the MST treatment, but sometimes you just need to see a film unaltered to truly appreciate it's wretchedness. This is one of those times. This is the original film as envisioned by genius director/writer/actor Harold P. Warren. Really the only difference between this and the MST version is approximately one minute of extraneous filler that the good folks at Best Brains removed to get it to fit into the two hour time slot with the host segments of Joel and the Bots.
I won't bother to review the plot much here as anyone who would be looking this up almost assuredly knows the plot already. In case you don't here is the much abbreviated version: a family gets terrorized by lunatic devil worshippers, one of whom, Torgo, has really big knees. There. That's it. The beauty of seeing this version is in noticing the small things and subtle nuances that aren't obvious from the MST version, most notably clearer dialogue. I would bet that some of little Debbie's lines was dubbed by adults trying to sound like a four year old, for instance. The dialogue is still wretched, of course, but you can hear it better now. You also get the added minute of footage, and a whole new appreciation of how much suffering the people at Best Brains went through watching this repeatedly while writing the MST script.
""Manos"" is definitely worth five stars: it truly is one of the most ineptly made films in history. It was the brainchild of Harold Warren, who spent his own money on it, and it brought him ridicule from legions of movie watchers since it was made in 1966. If you are interested in trivia, in addition to Warren's financing, Tom Neyman ('The Master') designed the sets. Neither ever worked in the movies ever again. On a genuinely sad note, the scathing criticism of this film is reportedly one of the things that drove John Reynolds ('Torgo') to suicide within a year after the films release.
It is amazing to think that this movie would have rested in obscurity, never again seeing the light of day if it hadn't been for the MST folks who brought it back into general circulation by mocking its very existence. Go watch the original. It's cheap and it only takes 69 minutes of your time.",1075593600,51,2331,4.646489104116223
1905875,5,B0000AGWMF,"Sorry Ed Wood freaks, but MANOS is the worst film of all time. This film is so sorry in every aspect of production that it makes Wood's 50's films seem like quality big studio B pictures. Poorly shot, poorly written, poorly acted, poorly dubbed, you cannot help but love this grade z masterpiece. Alpha Video does this anti-masterpiece all the justice it desearves. Which isn't much, but then again, I don't think this is high on Criterion's ""To Do"" list. The best $7 bucks you will spend all week.",1070150400,4,498,4.606741573033708
1905876,5,B0000AGWMF,"This is my second attempt at reviewing this movie. Perhaps my first post made it and maybe it didn't. I don't think it did, but if it did, totally ignore the second (or is it first?) post.
Of all of the movies I have ever witnessed, I have labeled 'Manos' the worst. I have never seen 'Plan 9 From Outer Space,' but I have been told in enough detail that this would have given 'Manos' a real run for the money and then some. However, until I see 'Plan 9,' this stills holds the record for a real stinkburger.
Dubbed by Mystery Science Theatre 3000 fans as the best movie ever riffed by the dynamic trio Joel, Crow, and Tom Servo. Well, ""best"" meaning ""the most uckiest movie ever."" If you question what MST3000 is, I suggest looking at their version of 'Manos' here on Amazon.
Anyway, 'Manos' starts first with an equally bad, yet in the end likeable-by-default short film, 'Hired: Part II.' This left my younger cousin splitting his seams. He had seen nothing funnier. After 'Manos,' he had forgotten entirely about 'Hired.'
The true tone for 'Manos' is set with the opening 10-minute-drive-to-nowhere. No dialogue, no action, just the family (Mom, Dad, daughter Debbie, and Peppy, the short-lived poodle) driving to the misslabled Valley Lodge. What of this Valley Lodge we are left to wonder. However, that is soon forgotten. The first ten mintues you also get to sample the music to the movie, easy-listening jazz. You will here nothing else besides the ""Haunting Torgo Theme.""
After the conspicuously incompetent father/husband, whose only defense for getting themselves horribly lost is the Valley Lodge sign, finally stops at a run-down (or is it luxurious? It's hard to tell from shaky camera angles and horribly picture quality) home on the edge of the desert, we finally get a mouthful of the true movie.
The house's caretaker, Torgo, ""greets"" the family, we finally also get a hint of how horrible the acting is. Torgo is the stuttering, probably perpetual drunk who watches the ""Master""'s house while he is away. Torgo's actual eye-candy that will have you snickering are his knees. His pants look like he jammed watermelon halves down the fronts.
From the there, the family is stranded, and after Torgo puts up little resistance at keeping them out, the family is then invited to stay. At first, the Master is merely away, perhaps on a trip of unknown origin. However, later in the movie, he is dead. ""But not dead in the way you know it,"" as Torgo so brilliantly exclaims. Then he is away again. Somebody bungled the script, methinks.
I won't spoil to much. Needless to say, the Master, whose servant is Torgo, of course, is somehow servant to Manos. Who Manos is exactly, we never figure. Perhaps it is the pyre that Torgo is ""executed"" on. (Torgo's execution, ordered by the Master, is first played out by his many wives who first merely wave their hands around his face in an annoying manner. Then, his left hand is burned off. The last we see of Torgo is his running into the desert. Some execution.) Of course, the Master needs a new Torgo, and what better replacement that Michael, the incompetent father/husband, who greets two young women in the end when they attempt to find the Valley Lodge.
Throughout the whole duration, no more than five minutes of dialogue is netted. Most of that is repetition (""She'll understand, Debbie's my girl. She'll understand."" Pause. ""Don't worry, dear. Debbie's my girl, she'll understand."") And that also brings up the point of the music. While the Master is out hunting the family, and Torgo is peeping in on the wife, all is set to easy listening jazz. The most foreboding music is the ""Haunting Torgo Theme,"" which is played twice, easy messily cut while Michael bullies Torgo into carrying his bags.
And to end that, I must mention: I, an intelligent youth and my father, an incredibly intelligent man, can still not figure out what, exactly, was the 'Fate' referred to in the title.
Well, that review was long and pointless, but I hope is a help to those who wish to view a HORRIBLE, MOST UCKY AND MISERABLE movie apart from 'Plan 9.' If I were to one-up my suggestion, it would be to purchase the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 edition, which not only features the movie, but the wisecracks and one-liners shot off by Joel and his robot friends.
Well, that is all for now, I guess.",1060560000,8,4342,4.714473684210526
1905877,3,B0000AGWMF,"Whether a movie falls into the ""so bad, it's good"" category or whether its just bad is of course subjective, but in my opinion, Manos qualifies for the former.

My three favorite things about this movie 1) Torgo.  This guy is the star of the show.  He steals every scene he's in, with his weirdly bent knees, his twitching, and his verbal tics.
2) The editing, _because_ it is so bad. In a good movie, the editing is typically transparent. In Manos, though for example, when Torgo reaches for Margaret's hair, the edits here gives her an oddly stretched-out reaction time - eh, it's hard to describe, you just have to see it.
3) The Master's outfit.  I have to get me one of these.

Because the movie is ""so bad it's good"" I can't give it 1 star, and I can't give it 5, so I'll split the difference and give it 3 (yeah, I know, I gave ""Glen or Glenda"" 5).

Note: I don't own this movie, I have this instead:

1905882,4,B0000AGWMF,"I like it for what it is ... it isn't Shakespeare, it's an old B-horror movie!!

""Manos the hands of fate"" is easily one of the dumbest movies you can ever sit through. It is unthinkable how this turd got made. Thank God it did. The film leaves you speechless. Every so often, someone comes along and declares that such-and-such a film is, and I quote, ""THE WORST MOVIE EVER!!!"" Usually the culprit is the latest big-budget, little-story extravaganza, or some popular work receiving its expected share of backlash. I always laugh a bit when people do this. Clearly, these innocent souls have never been exposed to the horror that is ""Manos: The Hands of Fate."" Some films are so bad, they're good. Meaning ""fun"" or ""entertaining"" or at least ""interesting""... But few films can claim to be so dreadful, you actually feel physical pain while viewing them. So bad are these damned few that you don't experience them or watch them: you ""endure"" them. This is the mother of all such films!

Sure, plenty of movies are bad, but usually if you look hard enough, you can see some evidence that someone on board had at least a vague idea of how to make a film work. Not ""Manos."" There is not a single shred of competence to be found anywhere in it. It fails on every conceivable level: direction, acting, script, cinematography, sets, costumes, effects, sound, music. Throw in some of the most irritating and idiotic characters you'll ever see, a lot of disturbing sexual subtext, and the result is this pile of cinematic excrement.

""Manos the hands of fate"" is without a doubt the most inept and atrociously awful film ever made. Its poorness is so extreme that of itself it is the film's strongest selling point. The script is non-existent, the acting makes Steven Seagal look like a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company and the editing could have been less horrendously botched by a blind Eskimo with no arms. It is also painfully slow. this film makes might barely last 70 minutes but you will feel like you've aged ten years by the end of it. That's what makes a film truly bad: the fact that despite its overbearing weaknesses it isn't even entertaining!

Many people look back at the sixties and think, with obvious resentment for today's cinematic output, that ""they don't make them like this anymore!"". Watching ""Manos..."" would cure any breed of hardcore nostalgia.

The story...well, I guess it's supposed to be one of those ""innocents get lost and stumble upon supernatural evil"" deals. Actually, it's more like an ""irritating family gets lost and stumbles upon a group of vague cultists and their creepy hired hand Torgo"" deal. Anyway, things happen, arguments go in circles, the mom of the family yells for her husband so much you wonder how she ties her shoes in the morning without him, the husband makes so many wrong decisions you wonder if he'd be any help with the shoe-tying thing, and the female cultists get into an extended wrestling match, revealing that under their diaphanous Grecian robes they're wearing modern bras and underwear.

The movie: This movie is usually ranked as one of the worst movies ever made. Why, you ask? Example #219: The movie producers built a leg contraption so that Torgo would look like a satyr with backwards bending legs. The only problem is that the actor playing Torgo wore the contraption backwards. So instead of looking like a satyr, he instead looks like his knees are swollen and the device made him walk very stiffly and unbalanced The leading man is a Frank Zappa lookalike with only a fraction of the talent Zappa (being dead) has. However, the real star of the film, Torgo (a goat-man), performed in some of the best walking-from-one-end-of-the-set-to-another scenes I have seen since 1950s Corman films.

There's much more, of course, but ""Manos"" is like a train wreck, or a natural disaster: I could describe it to you, but you'd never understand the full level of horror unless you witness it for yourself. So go ahead, watch it, I dare you. At least you can take comfort in the knowledge that, after you've seen it, nothing else you watch will be quite so bad.

Do yourself a favor. Sit back, grab a cold drink and enjoy one of the weirdest things ever put to celluloid. The master wants you to!

If you enjoy these kinds of movies, I suggest you check out ""Svengooli"" (previously called Son of Svengooli) Svengooli is a hosted horror movie show. The show's title is taken from the name of the character host. The show is a long-running local program in the Chicago area and in recent years expanded nationally, airing Saturday nights on Me-TV. To make it even better: ""Svengooli"" (Rich Koz) is truly a nice & decent person in real life.

SPOILER ALERT
While on a road trip near El Paso, Texas, Michael, Margaret, their young daughter Debbie, and their dog, Peppy, search for the ""Valley Lodge."" Michael and his family finally reach a house which is tended by the bizarre, satyr-like Torgo, who takes care of the house ""while the Master is away."" Michael and Margaret ask Torgo for directions to Valley Lodge; Torgo simply replies that there is no place like that around here. With this information, Michael asks Torgo to let him and his family stay the night, despite objections from both Torgo and Margaret.

Inside the home, the family sees a disturbing painting of a dark, malevolent-looking man and a black dog with glowing eyes; the man it depicts is the Master. Margaret becomes frightened upon hearing an ominous howl; Michael investigates, retrieving a flashlight and revolver from his car, and later finds Peppy lying dead on the ground. Torgo reveals his attraction to Margaret and tells her that, although she is doomed to become yet another bride of The Master, he intends to keep her for himself. Margaret threatens to tell Michael of Torgo's advances, but Torgo convinces her not to say anything to her husband by promising to protect her. Michael returns, unable to start the car. With the revelation that there is no phone in the house, the family reluctantly decides to stay the night.

Michael and Margaret stumble upon ""The Master"" and several women dressed in translucent nightgowns and later revealed to be his wives. They are all asleep. Torgo uses a stick to knock out Michael, and then ties Michael to a pole, after dragging him to it, and The Master suddenly comes to life. His wives also awaken, and a short argument over the fate of the family ensues. The Master decides he must sacrifice Torgo and his first wife to the film's mysterious deity and namesake, ""Manos."" When The Master leaves, his wives engage in further argument that soon degenerates into a fight, and the women wrestle in the sand.

Torgo succumbs to what appears to be a hypnotic spell by The Master. The Master stops the fight, and has his first wife tied to a pole to be sacrificed. Torgo is laid on a stone bed, where he is attacked by The Master's other wives, but this in itself does not prove fatal. Evoking some mysterious power, The Master severs and horribly burns Torgo's left hand. Torgo runs off into the darkness, waving the burning stump that remains. The Master laughs maniacally and goes to look for the family and subsequently sacrifices his first wife.

The family runs off into the desert. When a rattlesnake appears in front of them, Michael shoots it, attracting the attention of nearby deputies. Margaret and Michael are later convinced to return to the Master's house, where the Master welcomes them. Michael fires several shots into The Master's face at point-blank range, but they have no effect. The screen fades to black, likely indicating that The Master has again applied his hypnotic power.

An undisclosed amount of time later, an entranced Michael greets two new lost travelers. Margaret and Debbie have become wives of The Master. The film concludes with Michael echoing Torgo's line of ""I take care of the place while the Master is away.""

1905883,5,B0000AGWMF,"Was this movie shot in Japanese and dubbed over in English? If not, that poor little girl seems to have a glandular problem. She sounds like a 40 year old man speaking in falsetto.
I especially liked the endless shots of Texas wasteland. They gave the thing a pace of chilly tar that coupled so well with all that snazzy music.
I enjoyed Togor, too, the Vincent van Gogh reincarnation LSD casualty with gigantic knees. Watching him carry luggage was worth the price of admission. I felt kind of sorry for him, but not sorry enough. His flaming hand really did make a cool torch.
And that making-out couple. That guy's father needs to have a word with him. ""Son, let me tell you how to unsnap a bra..."" Did anyone notice he had on a wedding band? But she didn't? Oh, well, maybe it was his sister; she was ugly enough. I guess because it's Texas that makes it okay.
Although Utah springs to mind. What's the feminine word for homoerotic... let's see, I used to know. Well, whatever it is, the fighting wives scene isn't it. If they were contesting who got to trim The Master's Mustache it could, possibly, make sense.

Curiously, on a second viewing, it seemed that Maggie's slip matched the material of her scarf. Then there were the wives who were in the movie to add time to an already short movie. The Master was so-so, but his robe was awesome and the actor put the thing on full display at every oppurtunity. The cops were a waste of tin badges.

1905901,2,B0000AGWMF,"Manos The Hands of Fate(1966) is considered one of the worst movies ever made. TV's Mystery Science Theater 3000 brought the film back into the mainstream. This dream like, atmospheric supernatural horror film was written and directed by Hal Warren and made on a budget of $19,000. The crew poked fun of Warren's ego problem and nicknamed the film ""Mangos The Cans of Fruit"".
The film was shot with a camera that could only shoot 30 seconds of footage at a time. Manos was filmed without sound and three or four people looped voices onto the film. The MST3K version deletes some scenes such as the Master slapping his first wife several times! The MST3K version preserves footage of Michael(Hal Warren) pulling his car off the road. Hal Warren filmed Manos at an inn owned by a judge in Texas.
 There's three good jazz/R&B and rock songs on the soundtrack. It's a mystery who performed them. Manos' debut at the El Capri theater was a disaster. People in the audience poked fun of the movie. At the end of the film, people threw shoes at the screen! Manos is very boring and slowed paced at times. There's stock footage from a Disney film as Michael shoots a snake with a gun. The late John Reynolds gives a sincere performance as Torgo. There are rumors that he was using LSD on the set.
In Manos The Hands of Fate, a family on vacation gets stuck at an inn run by a satanic cult. ""Manos"" means ""hands"" in Spanish/Castellano. The Master has hands on his robe and Torgo has a hand on his stick. There's a scene where a boy and a girl are kissing in a car. One of the models/actresses broke her leg on the set. Warren shot her scenes in a car so she could still be in the movie. There's a good documentary called Hotel Torgo. The producers were able to find Manos actor Bernie Rosenblum and the judge who owned the inn. Manos is very flawed on an artistic and technical level. We can see moths and flies on the set. A movie slate is visible in one scene. I guess Warren tried to add sex appeal by putting the Master's wives in white bras and underwear, but it's not very erotic. Manos is almost as bad as Monster A Go Go(1965), a sci-fi film with no plot! Manos The Hands of Fate is bad movie classic.",1328659200,3,2200,4.365853658536586

1905907,1,B0000AGWMF,"... its main problem is that the scenes are simply too long.

While it is true that the acting, the script, the costumes, the scenery, and well, everything, about this movie is dreadful (at best mediocre), the things that made this movie terrible for me was the dragging on of the incredibly BORING SCENES. If the scenes were shorter, this movie would be much more bearable. The driving scenes are givens. So is the scene when Torgo hobbles off of the floor. Why not just show him standing in front of the Master instead of allowing all of that time to pass?

Two other elements made this movie just incredibly bad and boring: the music and the dialogue.

The music is at times passing, but utterly inappropriate for a horror film. It's too... jazzy. Makes you want to relax on a beach in the Florida Keys, not clench your fists to your armrests in stiffnecked terror. This film needs horrifying music, not a piano and a sax.

The voices and the script are both mediocre to bad. ""Row Row Row Your Boat"" was... eugh. I know it's not supposed to be a Broadway performance, but it sounded... so artificial. The Master's laugh sounded artificial, too - and bloody weak. Considering the sound was dubbed to begin with, a redub with competent actors would make this much better.

And of course the acting and costumes and  were terrible, too. It's like Torgo had some kind of muscular disorder or something. And Hal just looked tacky in that white jacket. The title card appeared at a poor time. It is inept and boring. As is, I can only give it a 2/10 (or 1/5, as it were).

But you know? With some editing, redubbing, adding a new soundtrack, it could actually shape up and become a half-decent B-movie. Of course, some parts of it will always be irreconcilably terrible, but it's not a completely lost cause. (Why do you suppose they are making a sequel to it?)",1289433600,,1858,4.528358208955224

1905909,1,B0000AGWMF,"The story behind the 1966 MANOS, THE HANDS OF FATE is more entertaining than the film itself.  Hal Warren was a Texas fertilizer salesman who dabbled in El Paso community theatre and who undertook the film as a bet.  Warren he raised the money, coaxed the cast and crew into working for percentage of profits, and pieced the movie together over three months of shooting.  The film was highly anticipated in El Paso, but it was on the screen for only a few minutes when the audience of local dignitaries began to snicker.  Most of the cast and crew quickly fled the scene; by mid-point most of the audience was gone as well.  Those who remained ended the showing by throwing their shoes at the screen, and an elderly lady attacked Warren with her purse.  The film had a brief run in El Paso and played several drive-ins in the area before it mercifully vanished--only to be rediscovered in 1993 by television's Mystery Science Theater 3000, a televison series that ridiculed bad movies.  The episode was so successful that it brought the original and unfiltered  MANOS to DVD, and it is has easily usurped PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE's position as the worst film ever made.

Michael (Hal Warren), wife Margaret (Diane Mahree), and daughter Debbie (Jackey Neyman) are on a vacation, where they get lost somewhere in Texass and seek shelter in an unimpressive house guarded by an unprepossessing servant named Torgo (John Reynolds, who committed suicide not long after the film wrapped.)  The family subsequently discover that Torgo's master (Tom Neyman) is a devil-worshipper with a host of wives--and he plans to add Margaret to the harem.  The plot, either deliberately or by accident, seems to owe a great deal to the celebrated 1930s Boris Karloff-Bela Lugosi THE BLACK CAT, but to say it does not live up to that famous film's fundamental plot would be the cinematic understatement of all time.

The movie was filmed with cameras that could not sustain more than about thirty seconds per shot.  The result is one cut after another after another.  The shots do not seem to have been edited so much as merely strung together.  There is typically a pause at the beginning and end of each shot; consequently the actors (all of them uniformly bad) have lots of stand-around time.  The actors are also badly placed for the camera, and the result is numerous close-ups of the back a head or empty space or something equally irrelevant.  The film was shot without sound and the entire script was dubbed afterward, and badly so, with lines out of synch and inappropriate voices and similar issues.  It hardly matters: the script is ridiculous and the whole thing is an insult to both art and intelligence.  If you have ever desired a catalogue of what NOT to do in making a film, MANOS provides it and then some.

Some bad films are actually so inept that they are amusing, and I did indeed laugh at the film for about fifteen minutes.  But MANOS is so relentlessly bad that it soon becomes very, very difficult to be amused by it, and I soon understood why the audience threw their shoes at the screen during the movie's debut.  Its sixty-something minutes felt longer than DANCES WITH WOLVES, OUT OF AFRICA, and THE ENGLISH PATIENT combined, and I felt tremendously sorry for all those involved.  My recommendation: the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 episode featuring MANOS is available on DVD and is extremely funny.  But MANOS on its own is not and should be avoided at all costs.  If you have to see it for yourself, remember that the film is in public domain and is all over the internet.  Don't purchase it or rent it, for it isn't worth seeing at any price.

As you can probably guess, this is one of those movies that lives up to its reputation as one of the worst movies ever made -- an achingly slow, absurd, random mess of hilariously bad EVERYTHING. And without the guys from Mystery Science Theater 3000 around to lampoon it, you're left with a movie so bad it makes Ed Wood look like Guillermo del Toro, and so boring that it could be used as a sleep aid.

A generic all-American nuclear family is apparently going on a sightseeing tour of the US's farm fields, when they stumble across a weird house out in the middle of nowhere. The only person there is a twitchy guy called Torgo (John Reynolds) who talks constantly about ""The Master"" and has enormous knees. Oh, and there's a pair of teenagers making out in a car who are told off by a nosy cop, who are then dropped and never seen again.

Anyway, anybody who has EVER seen a slasher movie has already figured out that there's something diabolical afoot -- the Master turns out to have a harem and a giant regent mustache. He also worships a weird deity named Manos (which means ""Hands,"" meaning the movie is called ""Hands: The Hands of Fate""), and he's determined to pull the nuclear all-American family into his web of evil, pedophilia and hypnotism. It's hard to care, honestly.

""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" is one of those movies where every single aspect of it is a disaster. I literally tried to find some positives in this movie, and they could all be counted on one hand with fingers to spare. It somehow comes as no surprise to me that writer/director/producer/star Harold P. Warren was a fertilizer salesman, and it comes as even less of a surprise that he never made another movie.

It doesn't even manage to be one of those movies that's so bad it's hilarious (like Ed Wood's) because it's simply so boring. The first several minutes are spent watching FIELDS go by, and the entire movie drags by at a glacial pace (how many minutes are devoted to Torgo tottering around?).

As far as cinematography goes, it looks like Warren filmed the entire movie with old cell phone that was dropped in a toilet -- it's grainy, wobbly, and full of glaring lighting and murky sound. The dialogue sounds like it was made up after a bad bender (""You have failed us Torgo. For this you must die""), and the soundtrack is just plain cheesy. And there are all sorts of random scenes that feel like they were cobbled together with no storyline in mind (the teens in the car, who are chastised by the police, leave and are never seen again... what was the point of that?!).

And of course, there's the acting: there is literally not a shred of talent in the entire movie. The actual acting is so wooden it could be chopped up and made into a table, and all the reactions are a few beats late, as if they're waiting for somebody to yell, ""Act scared! Act evil! Act angry!"" The family is so bland and devoid of personality that it's impossible to care what happens to them. Tom Neyman is hilariously wooden as the evil Master, and John Reynolds spends the whole movie twitching, blinking and staggering (for reasons that are never explained in-plot), sort of like a bearded Kristen Stewart.

""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" is too boring to be hilarious, too bland to be weird, and too abysmal to be watched. Here's a tip: if you must watch it, try taking some hallucinogens first -- it certainly can't make the movie any worse.",1270684800,4,3677,4.611620795107034

All the actors put up there own money to help make the film and in the end the mics never picked any voices up so the entire film is re-dubbed by 2 people, a guy and a girl. Because of the problem with the mics there are also no sound effects either. There was a sub-plot that never made it into the film that the character Torgo is half man-half goat.

Weird edits, voice overs, atrocious acting, repeated lines for no explained reason , characters just standing around when they should be doing something and completely stupid situations, the sub-plot of a couple that always is making out, the padding of scenery in this movie - how this movie was made is a mystery in itself.
Hal Warren was a fertilizer salesman I guess he wanted to make money so he and his friends decided to make a movie.
Hal Warren is Mike, a really stupid man who decides to spend the night in a home of devil worshipers. Apparently the family got lost on their way to the Travel Lodge for a weekend of fun (?). Well,it wouldn't have been a movie if he decided to just drive off after encountering Torgo (Manos housekeepper?) and a lousy dialog exchange,which just about any other person would normally do in real life. Torgo is supposed to be a Centaur (what a joke) Mike's wife Margaret is a hoot screaming ""where can Mike be"" , when he is just outside trying getting the car to start. This movie is beyond description other than it is so terrible. The dialog is way out there, things said where you the viewer are like why is saying this?

I couldn't believe there was even a crew for this movie. This makes Plan 9 look like Citizen Kane..
In a way, I wish the movie could be remade on a higher budget and maybe a better vision of what was supposed to happen in this movie. The story of man vs devil worshipers can be & has been a movie theme for years.

1905917,1,B0000AGWMF,"Directing: The direction in this ""film"" reminds me of one of those people who simply cannot, for the life of them, hang a picture straight on a wall. The problem is not that the person is too close to the picture, and therefore cannot see the mistakes he's making. The problem is also not an inability to make necessary adjustments after stepping back to look at one's work. The problem with this film's direction is much deeper. Do not be fooled into thinking that this film was bad ""on purpose,"" because if there is a God, this cannot be true. In the history of the world, no manure salesman has decided to make a crappy (pun intended) movie for the purpose of defining ""the crappiest movie."" No. The problem here is about the complete and utter failure of humanity. The word ""never"" had not yet been defined until this movie was ""made."" In the end, there's no reason to consider that this movie had a director.

Editing: When you were a child, you probably tried to shove two mismatched puzzle pieces together -- I admit, I've even tried this -- but you and I eventually learned that this is wrong. The editor of this film did not learn this valuable life lesson. The credits at the end of the film are the centerpieces of the editing. I only now understand that, quite possibly, editing did not occur in the production of this film.

Writing: This movie despises its writer, hates him in fact. In truth, there is no reason to think that this movie was actually written. I babysat an autistic child once. Even HE couldn't have written this tripe.

Acting: I understand that some people don't really get what it means to be in front of a camera. This is not the problem here. Although they have human faces and voices (all dubbed, of course), these ""actors"" are unable to even imagine themselves as being in a film. The uniqueness of their ineptitude is overwhelming at times.

This is a horror flick. The actual film isn't the horror; the horror isn't even filmed in fact. The true horror is this movie's sweeping destruction of the elements of film -- direction, editing, writing, acting, etc. Even the title, which translates to ""Hands: The Hands of Fate,"" would baffle the Sphinx. I know that Duran Duran named themselves twice, but this title is something else entirely. It is a sucker punch to everything linguistic and meaningful.

Why this movie took 2 and a half months to film is beyond me. This movie is 74 minutes long. There is no reason to believe that this movie took more than 74 minutes to film. After all, without a director, editor, writer, or actors, it's truly difficult for me to say that this is a film. There are those who want to find genius in such a deconstructive expression. Make no mistake, this movie is not smart, is not clever. The deepest meaning one can glean from manure is to never again step in it.

The ""acting"" in the movie is so horrible, the part where the cop pulls Michael over and the same guy did the voice of both characters without even attempting to differentiate between the two is just so bad you feel like squirming. However yet, the film is kind of endearing. It's one of those rare instances like Showgirls where the story is so awful, the acting is so unbelievably bad and the production has to be seen to be believed, but yet however instead of being dreadfully bad, it actually works brilliantly as a slice of camp.

1905933,2,B0000AGWMF,"Chances are, if you are looking at this movie online, you already know the reputation it has.  So I'm going to limit my review to talking about the quality of the Dvd version of the movie.

First off, the movie is missing part of the beginning. It abruptly starts with the first lines of dialogue.  In the MST3k version you see a few seconds of opening before the dialogue(in fact, one of the guys comments on how slow the driving is saying""this is the slowest chase scene i've ever seen."").  Its nothing important being cut out but its a shame you can't have the ""whole"" movie.

Also the transfer is terrible.  Yes the movie had a lot of lighting issues, but this looks as if the telescene operator didn't know what he was doing.  Compared to the MST3k version, its way too dark.  It makes a bad film seem even worst.  Its also quite grainy but I wasn't too surprised by that(I didn't expect a remastered version of the film although i would love to own one in the future).  The poor trasfer of this film also lead my eye to pick up something else about this version of the film.  On the bottom of the screen is a thin static line.  Usually this type of line appears when watching a worn down VHS tape.  So I'm guessing they Transfered this version to DVD not using a terrible work print but some VHS tape that was previously out.  Which makes the fact that they have the photography way too dark even more lame because its actually very simple to transfer a VHS tape to DVD and maintain the original VHS quality.

All in all, The sound of the film was not bad at all(Well, it was bad to start with but the dvd makers are not at fault for any of that).  It does have maybe a minute worth of footage not in the MST3K version, so thats a plus.

Its a cheap DVD to buy and you are getting your moneys worth.  No effort at all went into making this a decent DVD of MAnos: HAnds of FAte.

Possibly in the future Tarantino's Rolling THunder production will remaster it and put out an excellent version for us to enjoy how truly bad this film was and not how someone else made a bad film even worst with their version of the DVD.  (Tarantino owns a rare 35mm print of the film and I doubt rights would be that hard to obtain.  Guess we'll have to wait and see.)

I give this a two because if you love bad movies(I do!) this is a must see film worthy of 5 stars in that mind set.  However this dvd is simply an insult and not worth even its cheap price.

1905934,5,B0000AGWMF,"I love bad movies. I do! I love them, love them, love them. I love seeing how human beings are so adept at creating things of such awfulness that all you can do is stare blankly at them until they're done. I like to think of the actors looking back and thinking ""what on earth was I doing in this movie?"" and trying to find interviews where they deny all involvement.

Manos, the Hands of Fate, is truly one of the worst movies ever made. I can imagine a key grip getting up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat, panting hard, his heart racing, because one memory of filming crept into his otherwise peaceful repose.

I can imagine a best boy locking himself up in the guest bathroom of his house, shivering on the floor because he helped Manos, the Hands of Fate come into existence.

Everything made this movie terrible. The acting, the writing, the scenery, the music, the action scenes, the filming, the lighting... Everyhing made this movie a steaming pile of Bad Movie Glory. I think it's one of the best things I've ever seen in my life. Instead of making me cringe and whimper like so many bad movies, Manos, the Hands of Fate actually made me laugh myself to sleep. NOTHING has ever made me laugh myself to sleep.

I suggest that everyone see this movie. And then, you should see something that they consider really, really good. Lord of the Rings or Amelie or Muppets From Space, whatever floats your boat. Something that you really, really, really love. And watch them back to back. Manos, the Hands of Fate, followed by, say, Hamlet.

The last time I checked the list ""From Justin to Kelly"" held that position, but it has floated up (?) to the ninth position on the list.  ""Manos, the Hands of Fate"" (you have to use the entitle title each time and not reduce it to just ""Manos"") has an average rating of 1.5 on a 10 point scale.  The only other film that rounds out to a 1.5 is ""Monster a-Go Go,"" which I have already seen and I can already saw that since I gave it a three-star rating it is not the second worst movie of all-time.  However, there will be no such apologia for ""Manos, the Hands of Fate.""  I was hoping that this was a gloriously bad movie, that could be added to my short list of movies so bad they are great, which at this point consists only of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" from Ed Wood and ""The Brain That Wouldn't Die"" (a.k.a. the Jan in the Pan movie).  But, no, ""Manos, the Hands of Fate"" is so bad it is just plain bad.

Michael (director Hal Warren), his wife Margaret (Diane Mahree), daughter Debbie (Jackey Neyman), and Peppy the family dog are on their vacation driving around the great El Paso, Texas area looking for their motel.  They end up at this farmhouse asking for directions from the creepy Torgo (John Reynolds), who insists they cannot get there from here, so the family spends the night.  Torgo takes care of the place while the master is away, except then he says the master is dead, but that he says the master is not the dead the way most people would think.  This cannot be good, especially since there is a painting of the master and some sort of hell-hound on the wall to creep everybody out.  Meanwhile, Mike cannot get the car to start and Torgo is having no luck seducing (or at least pawing) Margaret.  Then Debbie's dog gets killed but she discovers ""a big place with a bunch of weird people"" and that is how the family comes face to face with the master (Tom Neyman).

There are scenes with a couple of necking teenagers in a car (Bernie Rosenblum and Joyce Molleur) being hassled by a cop (William Bryan Jennings), but that does not matter because once the master wakes up he gets in touch with Manos (notice, that is the name of the God of Primal Darkness and not the name of the film), and then wakes up his wives (Stephanie Nielson, Sherry Proctor, Robin Reed, Jay Hall, Bettie Burns and a few more) to discuss what to do with the visitors.  Heads must roll, and so do bodies as the wives, clad in flimsy white gowns, start wrestling on the floor as a way of arriving at consensus.  Eventually we get to a shocking ending and the movie is over, although it ends with the same title card as the beginning of the film and for one horrifying moment you wonder if the DVD is looping back to the beginning as some sort of sick joke.

Okay, if that does not help you, here is how the newspaper advertisement for the gala world premier of this film described the film: ""A cult of weird, horrible people who gather beautiful women only to deface them with a burning hand.""  Maybe now it makes more sense, but that is not necessarily a good thing.  The problem with ""Manos, the Hands of Fate"" (working title: ""The Lodge of Sins"") is not just that it is a bad movie but that it is a boring movie where it sounds like the same voices are dubbing all of the characters.  According to the IMDB, Reed was the only cast member to have an acting career in Hollywood, Torgo was supposed to be a satyr and the actor playing him committed suicide that same year.  But I did not need that last bit of information to confirm that there is little pleasure to be gleaned from watching this really, really bad movie that ended all aspects of the cinematic career of writer-director-producer-actor Hal Warren (a fertiziler salesman in El Paso, he made the movie for $19,000 with a camera that could only shoot 30-seconds of film at a time as a bet with a location scout that Warren could make a popular horror film with a tiny budget).

Why is ""Manos, the Hands of Fate"" not rated 1 star?  Because my position is that basically only a snuff film would be given 1 star and how many of those does Amazon really sell?  If something gets 1 star the people who made the movie need to be hunted down and at least incarcerated without parole (assuming the death penalty is not a possibility).  But for a 2 star movie you simply want to track down the director and slap them around until they come to their senses and admit they have a really, really bad movie.  The fact that Warren quit while he is behind saves us the trip.

The good news is that there is a ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" episode of Joel, Crow and Tom Servo watching ""Manos, the Hands of Fate,"" and even though the boys are not close to being on their A-game (how could they with the actual film serving as inspiration) it is better than watching ""Manos, the Hands of Fate"" by itself without a buffer.  The only other sensible thing to is getting the Something Weird DVD that offers ""Monster a-Go Go"" and ""Psyched by the 4-D Witch"" as a double feature to absolve yourself of having watched ""Manos, the Hands of Fate.""  Then you can be amazed at the gulf between the two films that head, so to speak, the IMDB's Bottom 100 list.",1123891200,2,5326,4.325628140703517

Second, with the exception of the mysterious Torgo, none of the characters have the least bit of... characterization. The film is blurry, shot with a camera that had no sound. And all the dubbing was done by 2 people! So when someone talks, it's hard to tell who, because all the voices sound the same and you can't tell whose lips are moving.

1905940,1,B0000AGWMF,"How do you begin critiquing the worst movie ever made?

Entertainment Weekly recently gave it a decent shot, though their article focused more on the history and making-of.  Here is my take on this wonderful piece of cinematic horror.

In what is perhaps the most delicious coincidence of all time, Manos was directed by a fertilizer salesman.  Yes, a fertilizer salesman.  His name is Hal Warren.  The film sank into well-deserved obscurity after its 1966 release, not to be unearthed until the television show Mystery Science Theater 3000 dug it from the depths of B-moviedom.  Devoted to making fun of awful movies, the comedy team didn't realize they were creating a cultural phenomenon.

Chances are, if MST3K creator Joel Hodgson and his gang hadn't found Manos, no one would have been aware of its existence.  A few of its flaws are obvious upon first glance: the ineptitude of the title, for instance, which translates to Hands: The Hands of Fate.  I can't help what wonder what would have happened if the film made it to international release.  Would they have called it Hands: Las Manos del Sino?  And needless to say, it is never made clear exactly what (or who) the hands of fate are supposed to be.

Oftentimes, people who are involved in the production of MST3K fodder complain that the show didn't do their films justice.  The brains behind Manos had the good sense not to do this, and for great reason: the uncut, un-riffed version of the film is no better than the MST3K'd one.  In fact, it is much, much worse.

It's the story of a vacationing family who is forced to stay at a creepy old house because their car broke down.  So far, so good.  The guy who lives there is a mumbling bearded fellow (as the MST3K team put it, he ""looks like a chainsaw sculpture"") with huge, deformed knees.  (As it turns out, he's supposed to be a satyr, but they only show his paper-mch&eacute; hooves once.  In the MSTed version, the row of ""theater seats"" makes them invisible.)  He speaks constantly about ""The Master.""  His two trademark lines are ""I am Torgo.  I take care of the house while the Master is away"" and ""the Master would not approve.""  He grudgingly allows the family to stay in the house, even though, surprisingly, ""the master would not approve"".

Then, all hell breaks loose.  Literally.

Actually not, unless you count women in diaphanous gowns fighting each other to be ""hell"".  As it turns out, The Master (Tom Neyman) is a member of the undead.  He worships a god called Manos, or something.  He has a ton of wives, also undead, who like to sit around and have loud, semi-coherent arguments that consist mostly of single-syllable words.  Sometimes they wrestle.  Of course.  At some point it becomes clear that The Master wishes to keep Mrs. Generic Horror Movie Heroine as his own.  But so does Torgo!  Oh noes!  Whatever will they do?  Fortunately Torgo is limited to traveling at about 2 inches per hour, thanks to his immobile knees.  It's not really a fair fight.

Stuff happens.  Unlike most bad horror movies, this doesn't even have a happy ending.  Only pain and darkness await.  All the voices are dubbed - badly - because the video camera that Warren used couldn't record sound.  Torgo speaks as if someone is jabbing him repeatedly in the throat.  But the crowning glory, I think, is the elegant speech made by The Master's oldest wife as they all argue about whom to kill:

""Man, yes!  Girl, no!""

To which MST3K's Crow T. Robot quips, ""Cheese?  Maybe!""

Cheese indeed.",1120348800,8,3507,4.679802955665025
1905941,1,B0000AGWMF,"'Manos' The Hands of Fate (Hal Warren, 1966)

Manos is widely considered to be the worst movie of all time. (Check IMDB. I don't believe any other film has actually inhabited the bottom slot since rankings were first implemented.) In one of my less lucid late-night wanderings around the internet-- I'm sure liberal amounts of bourbon were involved-- I decided, as I sometimes do with books/movies/etc. Most people think are insanely awful, ""this can't be as bad as everyone makes it out to be,"" and put it on hold at the library. Yes, my library has a copy of Manos (and yet, they don't have a copy of Cannibal Holocaust. What is this world coming to?).

Well, folks, I have now seen 'Manos' The Hands of Fate (no, the grammar in the title is not a typo), and I can truly attest that while there are movies I would put below it in a ranking of the all-time worst movies-- in fact, it wouldn't even make my bottom 10-- Manos is, truly, just about as bad as everyone says it is.

That Manos is simply cheesy-bad is not enough, though it is certainly that. The story concerns a family who are on their way to a lodge out in the country. They get there and meet the caretaker, Torgo, who's a very weird sort of person, and immediately figure something is very wrong. It is (and it has nothing to do with the script, the camera work, or the acting, although all of those are also very wrong)...

What is truly depressing about Manos is that it's obvious Hal Warren (who also plays the male lead) was obviously onto something very, very good. As a horror film, Manos tries to rely purely on atmosphere. This can be done exceptionally well in movies (Gaslight is a fine example, as is Session 9), but it is very, very hard to pull off. Manos is an attempt that tried, failed miserably, and then seems to take a side trek into the girl-gang movie (presumably, because Warren knew how badly it was failing and decided to try and spice it up with some catfights). If it hadn't been so ambitious, Manos might have been a simple cheesy gem, the kind of movie that you can't help but watch because it's so thoroughly awful (Shriek of the Mutilated, for example). But it's both cheesy and depressing, and that makes it just plain bad, on the same level as such utter abominations of filmmaking as The Day After Tomorrow. Come to think of it, Manos doesn't even have the in-your-face offensive immorality of The Day After Tomorrow.

Maybe it really is one of the ten worst films ever made. (zero)",1117152000,18,2482,4.458149779735683

1905945,5,B0000AGWMF,"One of the worst days of my life was the day I stepped in a steaming pile of ""Manos, the Hands of Fate."" I thought I knew what I was getting myself into when I bought the original, non MST3K version of the film on DVD, thought I could withstand the gutter level production values, the corpse-like acting from a cast of unknowns, the peppy Muzak soundtrack, the continuity errors, the molasses pacing, the cut and paste editing job, and dialogue that has an affect on the brain not unlike novocaine. I have seen some bad cinema in my short time on planet earth, but ""Manos,"" a film directed, written, and starred in by a fertilizer salesman from El Paso, Texas, easily sails past such memorable dreck as ""Warriors of the Lost World,"" ""Feardotcom,"" and ""Jack Frost."" The film was so bad that the cast and crew snuck out of the theater during its premier, probably because they feared the audience would lynch them for unleashing this atrocity on humanity. According to a website dedicated to all things cinema, three of the actors in this film committed suicide within a year of the movie's release. While I hope the poor quality of the picture had nothing to do with these suicides, you will seriously wonder if it did after watching this car wreck.
Considering how this movie consistently fails in nearly every aspect, one important element not lacking is a plot. A family, consisting of mother, father, daughter, and poodle, heads out across the blasted wastelands of Texas on a fun filled trip. The excursion consists of a shifting series of seemingly endless shots of the barren landscape, punctuated occasionally by staccato bursts of nonsensical dialogue. Moreover, the first strains of elevator music play over the proceedings. You will learn to loathe this music, but at first it's sort of funny to hear these types of tunes in a film. The family ends up arriving at a decrepit house populated by the film's strangest character (and that says a lot). This is Torgo; a bizarre looking dolt who whispers stuff about ""Master,"" sways a lot, and shambles around while whimsical music plays. He also takes a hankering to the mom character, has kneecaps the size of tires, and acts as the procurer of hapless victims for this enigmatic ""Master."" By the time I reached this point in the feature, I began mentally willing time to move faster. I looked at my watch so many times I suffered compound whiplash. But the Muzak kept playin', Torgo kept shufflin', and the dialogue kept getting dumber, so I kept watchin'. What can I say? I'm an idiot that way.
After the poodle and the daughter disappear, the parents become alarmed about Torgo's antics. Dad heads out into the dark desert to look for his kid and runs into a heap of trouble. It turns out ""Master"" and a number of his scantily clad wives are holding a secret ritual that requires the family to play a pivotal role. ""Manos"" shifts focus significantly here, as we see the inner workings of these odd characters. What do they do? Not much. Master wears a nifty cape with two large hands stitched on it (the best effect in the film, actually) while he rants and raves, and the women stand around gabbing or wrestling with each other. Torgo gets into so much trouble that Master decides to sacrifice him for his crimes in a spectacularly boring way. Why? Who knows? Who cares? If you're so involved in the film that you need answers to these questions, you have problems in need of serious resolution. The story fails in many ways but succeeds wildly in one important aspect-it ends.
""Manos, the Hands of Fate"" reminded me of another film I watched recently, the incredibly awful ""Invasion of the Blood Farmers."" Both movies looked terrible but had a weird appeal, much like a car accident on the highway. You know you shouldn't look at human misery and suffering, but you simply cannot help doing so. One reason you look at such a horrific tragedy is for life affirming reasons; you're so thankful that isn't you and yours stretched out on the road. The same principle applies here. I'm so glad I had nothing to do with the production of ""Manos, the Hands of Fate"" that watching the whole thing provides a certain measure of detached relief. This principle is completely theoretical, of course, but it does justify why I let the DVD run all the way to the end. For some reason, claiming to love bad cinema for the sake of its badness just doesn't seem enough with movies like ""Manos"" and ""Invasion of the Blood Farmers."" In fact, promoting this picture as ""so bad its good"" in certain circles would probably get you taken out behind the woodshed. Watch ""Manos, the Hands of Fate"" as a metaphysical exercise and you'll probably emerge unscathed. Maybe. O.K., probably not, but I'm just trying to make the experience easier for you.
If you really must view this abomination, at least you won't pay a heavy monetary price to do so. Forget about any extras on the DVD-there aren't any, and that's how it should be for such a wretched piece of refuse. And really, why would you want a widescreen, crystal clear picture transfer, trailers, interviews, behind the scenes footage, commentaries, film history, and stills when a film like this one goes above and beyond the call of duty? ""Manos, the Hands of Fate"" is one of the seven wonders of the cinematic world. Enjoy, if you dare!",1082678400,131,5331,4.684434968017057

7997059,5,B0000AGWMF,"Well...simply put, this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm not even sure if it qualifies as a movie. I've seen better stuff s*** out by wannabe film students using flip phones.

However, it is one of the most entertaining movies as well. As far as bad movies go, this is definitely one of the better ones to watch. Fairly brief, too, clocking in at less than 70 minutes, including credits I believe, but it stretches on for an eternity.

Read the other reviews on here. I'm not going to regurgitate all of the information like a mother bird to you.

But I will say this:

YES it is that bad.

YES it is that entertaining.

YES you should see this movie at least once.
