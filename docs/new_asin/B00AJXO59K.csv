5444200,2,B00AJXO59K,"Im actually not happy to give this film a bad rating, but trust me it deserved it. I really love supporting indie films, especially African American ones, so while i don't wanna harshly judge the directing/production. I must admitt this was not excellent or even good (in my opinion).

This was promoted as a film, not a collection of short films that do not come together at all. I'm shocked by the popular Black Actors/Actress who actually participated in these short films, which were boring and prolonged. Ive seen tons of short films, and these were not up to standard, they left much to be desired.

I wrote this review to help others save there hard earned money, don't be tricked by the trailers/promotions are familiar faces. Honest review :)",1366761600,18,751,4.769230769230769
5444201,2,B00AJXO59K,I THOUGHT I would be watching some really good love stories with a plot.  ALL I got was as bunch of dialogue between black males and females unhappy with each other.  LYNN WHITFIELD did a good job acting but somehow was unbelievable.,1366416000,4,233,4.523809523809524
5444202,5,B00AJXO59K,One of the best movies I've EVER seen!!! The film is very creative and well thought out. This film is much different than your usual run of the mill love story. Its a must-watch!!!,1365897600,,180,4.323529411764706
5444203,4,B00AJXO59K,"This movies  displayed a lot of different points when it came ot who you love and why. The cast played their roles outstanding and I would highly recommend this movie, especially to couples.",1365379200,,190,4.757575757575758
5444204,5,B00AJXO59K,Done very well for a play that was turned into a film. I enjoyed the acting and the directing. Very character driven.,1364256000,,117,4.363636363636363
5444205,5,B00AJXO59K,"Great story line.  Love the actors and so true in so many ways when it comes to the the ups and downs of love and a binding relationship whether it be marriage, dating, friendship, working relationship, etc.  Definitely a message about give and take and compromising. We don't always have to be right, so lets agree to disagree and keep loving!!!!",1363996800,4,347,4.672131147540983
5444206,5,B00AJXO59K,"This is a VERY well written, well acted and directed story. Very raw and real. I recommend this to anyone that doesn't like cliched Black Cinema.",1363824000,,145,4.615384615384615
5444208,5,B00AJXO59K,I LOVED THE DVD I I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE ACTORS IN THE DVD. I'M GLAD IT WAS AVAILABLE.,1415750400,,85,3.7777777777777777
5444209,5,B00AJXO59K,"I loved this movie.  The writing was great and the all star cast did not disappoint! Don B Welch is masterful at telling stories and he is very detail oriented, which adds to the believability of the characters and the plot. I'm looking forward to more of these stories!  Yessss!",1393113600,,279,4.56
5444210,4,B00AJXO59K,"I believe every person involved in a relationship may have felt like these emotions at some point in the relationship.  However, Lyn Whitfield, once again, put it down for the crazy sisters who felt betrayed by a lover.",1390348800,,219,4.7631578947368425
5444211,2,B00AJXO59K,"OMG! Where should I start... First of all, this should absolutely NOT be called a movie. I really don't know what the correct term should be. The cast was put together very well and I really don't know what in the hell convinced them to participate in this crap, they had to be mislead on the outcome of what this will turn out to be. But then again, don't most actors and actress view their work before it goes out mainstream? Anyways getting back to the point- the stories could've been elaborated on more. At first glance, they all have potential. Instead of dragging them out only to never finish them is torture.

The story lines never came full circle so no loose ends were tied up. Actually, the entire film is a LOOSE END!

And it just went off. Just like that! Wow! Definitely a big bust that makes me look at the actors differently. The will except any rolls to make a quick buck!",1388880000,,890,4.355421686746988
5444212,5,B00AJXO59K,Just need appreciate the good and the bad of any marriage and etc.  Try to learn from every situation to make you and your spouse better.,1377993600,,137,4.269230769230769
5444213,4,B00AJXO59K,Good movie..thought it mirrored real life...not as bad as people say... Each character played an excellent role... I watched this movie on my way to Paris.. Ms Whitfield played her role well... Good movie,1377734400,,204,5.029411764705882
5444214,1,B00AJXO59K,"What did I just watch? This was one of the most disappointing and terrible movies I've ever seen. Scenes were entirely too long and, for the most part, uninteresting and nothing came together. A movie with a decent cast that created a cluster of crap that was promoted as a movie. I'm not sure why there are ANY good reviews on this movie.",1377734400,4,339,4.396825396825397
5444215,4,B00AJXO59K,"This movie was a series of vignettes concerning various married couples. I was not really impressed, but it wasn't bad.",1377388800,,119,5.0
5444216,2,B00AJXO59K,very poor film. i wanted to like this but it was quite boring and amateurish considering its got some decent actors in this,1374710400,,123,4.391304347826087
5444217,1,B00AJXO59K,"Waste of my life i cant get back!!! I actually watched it to the end and didn't think it could get any worse or it would pick up.... I do have to give Lynn Whitfield her props because its what she does well...I seriously could have written a better story than this and I'm not even a writer.... I'm a designer

5444218,1,B00AJXO59K,"This movie seemed to be going along the lines of Tyler Perry's For Colored Girls (I movie that I did not like, BTW). However, the dialogues and monologues just seemed to go on endlessly. All I could imagine was taking a nap or fast forwarding it, hoping that the plot would thicken. The plot didn't thicken. In fact, I don't know if there was a plot. Just several stories that I suppose every day people are supposed to recognize from their own lives. No resolution. Ending sucked. I'm glad I watched it on Netflix during a rainy Sunday.",1370736000,3,537,4.489795918367347
5444219,3,B00AJXO59K,"The ten different looks into the different relationships are so true but it actually make you wanna know more, it should of been a short story on IFC",1369785600,,149,4.357142857142857
5444220,3,B00AJXO59K,this movie lead you to believe that it would be about these couples and that they would all know one another and be a part of each others life,1368489600,,142,3.9310344827586206
5444221,5,B00AJXO59K,Very well written and intelligent film. It tells both sides from the male and female point of view very well. Great cast and acting by all. Scenes are a little long but I give it a strong two thumbs up. Please support this great film!,1367971200,,234,4.222222222222222
5444222,4,B00AJXO59K,"this was a great assortment of short film dealing with many black issues: stargazing, pregnancy or profession, marriage rebirthing and others. I love Melinda Williams and Keith Williams story because it touches so much of my own life. This is a great set to unwind to after a long day. Enjoy It.",1367712000,,295,4.6923076923076925
5444223,1,B00AJXO59K,The focus on the one shot for so long made this story so boring. It could have had potential. A complete snoozer,1367539200,,112,4.136363636363637
5444224,1,B00AJXO59K,A collection of short movies and it ends crazy.  It was long and drawn out for no reason.  Don't waste your time.,1367193600,,113,4.090909090909091
5444225,1,B00AJXO59K,Basically I bought this movie from Wal-Mart and watched it.  Movie was so boring I fell asleep.  Tried to sell it on Amazon and I couldn't for some reason. So I'm giving it away.,1367193600,7,178,4.205882352941177
5444226,1,B00AJXO59K,This movie had great actors and actresses in it which seemed to be a waste of time. There was no plot. I understood the story lines but was waiting for the next scene for what happens next. Well I am still waiting. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.,1367193600,6,258,4.18
5444227,1,B00AJXO59K,This was NOT a good movie. A woman who chose to sleep with a married man and then blamed him for ruining her self esteem. Seriously? Bad movie indeed.,1367107200,2,150,4.206896551724138
8552774,5,B00AJXO59K,Will watch again,1482105600,,16,4.666666666666667
8552775,1,B00AJXO59K,Heavy foul language and disrespects for themselves and those that might watch..telling her boy friend that his mother could kiss her a.. .and that was only the beginning. I passed and suggest you do as well.,1467072000,,207,4.777777777777778

8552779,1,B00AJXO59K,"If you like movies where multiple stories lines are going on at the same time but none of them evolve then this is the movie for you. The was possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. I mean this movie didn't make any sense! There was no continuity, the acting was awful it wasn't even what I expected from your average low budget film. I just finished and I'm sitting here scratching my head wondering how I just wasted 97 minutes of my life that I can't get back! I watched this movie on Netflix so if you happen to see it in a retail store don't bother to purchase it.",1447977600,,570,4.1441441441441444
8552780,1,B00AJXO59K,How does stuff like this get play? I really wanna know? The scenes dragged on forever with extra dialogue that wasn't even needed. Why give us all of those details with no outcome? Why did they need to name drop so many actors? Did they sponsor or co produce the film? I'm so mad I wasted my time watching this.,1446249600,,311,4.2
8552781,1,B00AJXO59K,OMG!!REALLY!! The absolute WORST movie in the history of movies! A silent black and white movie would be a better use of time. If you can manage to get past the 25 minute long opening scene spent in the bathroom with terrible acting the rest of the movie is just as bad!,1436745600,,270,4.211538461538462
8552782,1,B00AJXO59K,The best part of the movie was the ending.,1436054400,,42,3.7777777777777777
8552783,2,B00AJXO59K,"Just watched it today and I feel like it was a waste of time really. I do like a movie that explores relationships but I was super annoyed just watching the first couple on screen. I will admit I had other expectations about this movie but realized as it got closer and closer toward the end that this wasn't that type of movie. See i was hoping the stories would tie together somehow or get resolved in some way but it doesnt and.......... slight SPOILER: the endin leaves off on a BAD note.

I didn't like this movie and i feel cheated that they used familiar actors to get u to watch. I get the concept but i think it was poorly executed and boring. 24 hour love? they cant even make it thru the day. instead of showing a whole bunch of couples or stories, they should have took that day to focused on one or two situations and show how it plays out.",1432944000,,853,4.16969696969697
