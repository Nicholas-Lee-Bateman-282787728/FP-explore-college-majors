8442634,3,B004V2FVD4,"3 1/2 stars.  It was really bad. Yet it wasn't. I really loved it. Except the parts I didn't.

Things to love: Youthful Aamir, with that mane of thick, black hair and those smoldering looks he gives out from under those eyebrows; playing the grown love-child of an insistently passionate union between an upper class Hindustani and gorgeous gypsy woman.  Of course, of course! Aamir must play the one with gypsy blood: what's not to love about that.  All this, in a love-hate relationship with his half brother, played by the also young Saif Ali Khan.

Things not to love:  Aamir does not come of age and enter the movie until more than half way through. At this point where Aamir and Saif Ali enter the movie, the transition from traditional costuming and scenery of the set up of the story of the parents and grandparents generation to the young people's India of the 90s was shockingly rough and makes the view say, What the heck did I just watch?  Lastly, some parts meant to be dramatic were just really funny to this American watching a 20+ year old Hindi-language movie (a la My mother was a...commercial singer!)

Other: picture quality is good, sound quality is a little less-good, but I have heard worse in these movies from this time period .  Overall, I'm glad I have it and will probably watch it again because I love to hate it, like an old kung-fu movie.",1450051200,,1369,4.555102040816327
8442635,4,B004V2FVD4,"I cant believe this film wasn't such a big hit it deserves. The storyline is terrific. 2 generation told story. The first being the senior actors conflict. Sunil Dutt and Vinod Khanna as father and son, where Sunil Dutt is strict on his high status tradition. Vinod Khanna and his friendship with Anupam Kher (Sunil Dutts enemy). Vinod falls in love with Anupam Khers sister Rambha and makes her pregnant but is forced to marry Ashwini. Both give birth to sons. Second generation is Aamir Khan who's mum Rambha dies and lives with Anupam Kher and Saif who lives with his mum and grandpa with a easy rich life. Both start realising they are step brothers and the hatred starts. Great acting by Aamir Khan and Sunil Dutt. Vinod Khanna was alright, Saif Ali Khan was still new at the time and was OK, The girls were fine. Music is decent and the overall movie is entertaining.",1306281600,,873,4.56687898089172
