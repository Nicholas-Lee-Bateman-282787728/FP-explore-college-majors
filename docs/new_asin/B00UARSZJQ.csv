7033260,2,B00UARSZJQ,"Story itself had some potential/intrigue but is plagued by low budget casting and acting.  I appreciated the feel of some of the background piano music used and the older non cookie cutter suburban houses this was shot in.

However, Main characters are incredibly shrill and self-righteous to the point where I was rooting for the ""poltergeist.""  The main character is a typical plain hysterical millennial type who seems to think all men have some baffling interest in stalking her. Too many characters seem to be lifelessly mouthing movie creator's politics. IOW no one is sympathetic. Some characters are even hard to tell apart. I think family members were cast.

Can't help wondering why so many nearly unwatchable horror movies are available on demand but not the classics.  If you have Amazon prime much better horror/suspense is available-save your money.",1432512000,,863,5.179856115107913
7033261,3,B00UARSZJQ,"Dont expect too much from the acting or the way it was filmed,or even the scares lol. It was low-budget but average to me because the story was pretty good.",1432080000,5,156,4.233333333333333

7033304,1,B00UARSZJQ,"This movie only gets one star because, try as I might, I can't figure out how to rate it lower. Being a horror fan, I have seen a lot of bad movies. A ton. I don't really even mind bad movies. You can have a lot of fun with them.
This movie however, goes beyond bad. Horrible acting, bad cinematography, bad lighting, a murky plot. What more does an awful movie need? If you are looking for something more entertaining, I'd suggest you buy two knitting needles and jam them into your eye sockets as deeply as you can while simultaneously roasting your testicles in a toaster oven. I found that to be more enjoyable and slightly less painful.",1438128000,4,641,4.394957983193278

7033332,5,B00UARSZJQ,"For an extremely low budget film it actually does an impressive job. There are a lot of much budget films that don't come close to this, it's still low budget but a decent horror flick. It's more of a thriller/ghost movie and not a gore fest if that's what you're looking for, some of the images are a bit misleading, but I prefer those types of movies anyway.",1434153600,,360,4.3088235294117645

7033336,2,B00UARSZJQ,"Paige (Marina Petrano) parties in Borely Forest and gets a poltergeist attached to her. It is a bit annoying, like her acting, but then things get worse as she looks for solutions.

This is another low budget film with the name ""poltergeist""  in the title. To cover all the bases the forest was home to a Satanic cult, Civil War battle, and Indian burial ground and that slasher thing. Marina Petrano reminds me a of Lindsey Lohan. Paige has friends who help her, a brother, a semi-love interest, and parents who keep her grounded.

The production suffered from low budgetgeist. It lacked dialogue and people who could deliver it. In 1951 people didn't say, ""This was the worse day ever."" More like, ""This was the worse day I ever had.""  Of course that is a minor criticism of our young authors.

Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity. Bad shower tease. $9.88 US Walmart. Watch ""Altergeist"" instead",1433808000,,894,4.705128205128205

7033372,1,B00UARSZJQ,Really bummed I spent money on this. It's the reason I started watching the trailers before I purchase things. Low budget indie horror movies should seriously not be on amazon to purchase! Wtf?,1433721600,,193,4.878787878787879
7033373,5,B00UARSZJQ,I don't like super gory horror flicks so this movie was a great choice for me. I liked the suspense and plot. Big thumbs up!,1433721600,,124,4.0
7033374,1,B00UARSZJQ,Obviously low budget by the pitiful acting and plot that wasn't even exciting. I struggled through it until the end. It just isn't worth the money or time to watch a few immature individuals in a weak plot.,1433635200,,206,4.447368421052632
7033375,4,B00UARSZJQ,This was well put together movie and had a meaning and not the  copy cat crap movies that are out by some of the movies and  no i am not part of the movie  it could been better but it  had message everyones bad expections about this  movie can be bad for your ownself,1433462400,,267,3.8703703703703702
7033376,5,B00UARSZJQ,"The film was tastefully crafted and had me at the edge of my seat at times. Perhaps it's not a hardcore thriller, but it will appeal to a larger audience. Despite a minor flaw or two, it was a good watch, and I would recommend it!",1433462400,,230,4.021739130434782
7033377,5,B00UARSZJQ,"Alright, I was skeptic but The Poltergeist of Borley Forest got me. It's a decent horror flick! It plays perfect to watch with a large group of friends or even with your sweetheart. There are a few scenes that make you jump, don't lie, a few scenes that make you laugh with the characters (my fav is the Dr.) and oh, the scene where they visit the gardening lady, that got me! All in all I liked it. I definitely felt my hair flare up when the movie ended and there was nothing left but me and darkness. Sweet dreams!",1433289600,,517,4.18

7033380,4,B00UARSZJQ,i really like this movie because it has a really good story and great effects and things happened that i would not expect making it a really good horror movie i think anyone looking for a scary movie that's different than others and is really good should watch this i gave it 4 stars because its not the best movie ever but its definitely really good and better than i expected so im glad i decided to watch it,1432944000,,410,4.2025316455696204
7033381,1,B00UARSZJQ,"This was horrible!!! I am not sure who who have given this any higher star. I could have filmed something better. I rented this because it had such a high star count, but I am wondering if the stars are from people who were friends or family of those involved. A complete waste of money.",1432944000,3,287,4.236363636363636
8705036,1,B00UARSZJQ,"Terrible, low quality, bad acting don;t waste your money.",1460332800,,57,5.444444444444445
8705037,3,B00UARSZJQ,"I'm still not sure why i liked it, i probably wouldn't have liked it as much, if i had to pay for it.
It's something to watch if you have nothing else to watch, the effects are horrible, the sound work is.. not good (i think they mic-ed the feet crunching in the forest at some points), the editing needed some work. But this movie has a weird charm about it, The parents cannot act, but the kids all can, which stands out a lot for me in low budget films.
  Paige is an teen artist, who lives with her controlling parents (i mean they are parents, but some of the things they say are just plain bizarre). So Paige goes out to a party in the woods, and runs into a creepy tree, and isn't really phased by it, until she starts seeing things. Mysterious things happen and her parents security systems cannot seem to pick up on the fact that nothing is there,so naturally they ground her.  Haunting like stuff keeps happening, and her brother, who served in the army, but now runs some video editing place or something, is real nice to her. So her parents need to go out of town and paige is left alone, to get creeped out by things that aren't there, and work at her job where her brothers co-worker cooper keeps visiting.
I'm doing a terrible job at reviewing this and i apologize. There's just some stuff in here that is pretty neat, it kind of shocked me with it's ending, because i kept thinking of cliche things happening, but it was a bit surprising. I'm pretty disappointed that virtually none of these actors (Paige, especially) has never acted again.

So! The acting is good, some plot holes go nowhere, it runs a bit long, the parents cannot act, the sound guys i think went on vacation. But there is something that i liked about it, and i cannot explain it.  I watch super bad horror movies as a hobby, so for me to like this one as much as i do, baffles me.",1457740800,,1867,4.277620396600566

8705040,1,B00UARSZJQ,"This movie, if that's what you want to call it, has some of the most pedestrian actors a film could possibly have.  Do not waste your time unless you are looking for a movie to pick apart and laugh at...",1443744000,,203,4.075
