1845550,4,B00008G8PP,"I recently saw a episode of Rurouni Kenshin on Cartoon Network and found the show to be very interesting. I purchased all 95 episodes on DVD and became hooked. After I finished watching all 95 episodes, I wanted to learn more about Kenshin Himura, the man formerly known as Hitokiri Battousai, the rebellion's most feared assassin. When I learned that a movie was available on DVD that was a prequel to the series, I immediately ordered it and was blown away by the story and artwork. All the questions that anyone may have about the series and about Kenshin's past will be revealed, including how he got his famous cross shape scar and why he became a wanderer. My only complaint is that the dub does not stay true with the translation. All in all, this is an excellent addition to anyone's anime library who is a fan of Rurouni Kenshin.",1054598400,,838,4.556291390728477
1845551,5,B00008G8PP,"Himura Kenshin, now a wanderer, has his life's story told in this story of Trust & Betrayal. Death has followed him since he was a child and all he ever wanted was to use his sword to save people. This is the story of how one misstep could lead a young man into chaos and the one woman who could save him. Will he chose to be a manslayer, or a humble citizen? Watch to find out!
Overall the graphics are good. Some scenes use computer animated footage of real things which is creepy. There is a lot of blood shed and murder. For those who don't like that, DON'T WATCH! For fans, it explains his cross-shaped scar. One of the best movies yet!",1054425600,3,641,4.17741935483871
1845552,5,B00008G8PP,"I'm a fairly newcomer to the Kenshin saga having only seen the series on the Cartoon Network which is how my curiosity was sparked after learning that there was a more seriously mature story out on DVD.
This is a classic love story as only the Japanese mindset can conceive of with Tomoe's reclaimation of Kenshin's humanity.  The ending brought me to tears both in the original Japanese with English subtitles and English version.
Because of the bloody killings and violence I would not recommend this for anyone under the age of 17.
I really enjoyed this and have just ordered ""Reflection.""",1053993600,,592,4.803921568627451
1845553,1,B00008G8PP,"I would first like to say that I really enjoy Rurouni Kenshin and the especially the Samurai X movies, however, having said that I was greatly disappointed with this release.  I was hoping for more than an additional fight sequence that appeared in the very end of the movie.  Also, I was very bummed, by the lack of extras on the DVD itself.  In all the DVD is quite worth it if you don't own Trust and Betrayal.  Another redeeming quality if you don't own the aformentioned movies is Director's Cut is one long feature not divided into two episodes as it appears on the other two DVDs.  Also, the cover is reversible, but the reverse artwork really was not that great.  Overall, the only reason I gave this DVD 1 star was because it is Samurai X and the story is wonderful, but if already own T&B don't bother.",1053734400,2,812,4.38
1845554,2,B00008G8PP,"because there is NO point getting this for less than 10 seconds worth of additional scenes that you really aren't going to notice much.
Gee, let me see.. there is that additional half sec of kenshin stabbing and twisting his sword, additional 1 sec of using two hands to cut down a man, additional 3 sec of battle in the bridge scene, couple additional facial shots in different angle.. and oh, all four anime packed into one dvd in original Japanese OVA style.. and this coming from a guy who saw trust and betrayal over 10 times.  I really wonder what was ADV's point of bringing this masterpiece back as ""director's CUT"" when there really.. isn't much to offer other than saving $$

If you haven't seen or own trust and betrayal, by all means get this DVD.  your basically getting two for one deal, but if you already own both, trust me - skip it.",1053561600,14,850,4.435897435897436
1845555,5,B00008G8PP,"For anyone who is a fan of samurai films, wrenchingly emotional love stories, or just beautifully detailed animation, this film is highly recommended.  For fans of the ""Rurouni Kenshin"" series, this is essential viewing, as we see Kenshin's past and learn about how he came to be the man he is in the TV show, set ten years after the end of this film.
While the film is essential, I'm not sure that this version is really better than the earlier one. The ""Director's Cut"" combines all four episodes of this story, released earlier as two separate DVDs (""Trust"" and ""Betrayal"").  The film has been letter-boxed for this edition, and there are some slight changes-- an added battle scene, bits of additional dialogue, etc. The biggest advantage of owning this version is being able to see the whole story without interruptions from credits or having to switch discs.
At the same time, there are some things about the ""Director's Cut"" that are annoying.  First, ADV films chose to remove the option of watching the English dub of the film with the English subtitles on.  Granted, most people would chose either just the dub or the Japanese version with the subtitles, but keeping the subtitles on while watching the English dub can be helpful in showing additional detail about what's going on, and can point out where the English version changed things from the Japanese (which is occasionally important; in at least two scenes, characters give very different motivations for their actions in English and Japanese).
ADV also chose to remove the extras which were present on the previous edition of this film-- the screenwriter's notes on the process of preparing the English edition, and a set of introductions to the historical characters in the film.  I don't understand why they took these features out; they were both interesting and useful for an audience which probably doesn't know a lot about nineteenth-century Japanese history.  Usually, one would expect a Director's Cut to have more extra features, not fewer.
Because this was done by a different studio than the one that did the English version of the TV show, there are also some historical details or references to things that are important for the TV show that don't show up here in the dubbing. The English version wasn't aimed at an audience that would already know the show, while the original Japanese version was.  Since this was done by a different studio, this also means that the English voice cast for ""Samurai X--Trust and Betrayal"" isn't the cast from the ""Rurouni Kenshin"" shows; this is only relevant for three characters, and is usually not too distracting.",1053216000,6,2635,4.921171171171171
1845556,5,B00008G8PP,"Simply put, this DVD is a must own for Kenshin fans and new-comers alike.  Having seen the OVA episodes in the past, the seamless combination is wonderful and in turn makes it somewhat easier to follow for all the nuances that die-hard fans are usually keen to pick up on later in the series and in the Seisouhen.  The letterboxing, although technically pointless, is a nice touch for a cinematic feel.  Definitely worth the purchase, I'm glad I added it to my collection and you will be too.",1052870400,,492,4.568181818181818
1845557,4,B00008G8PP,"SAMURAI X is probably better referred to as the OAVs for a popular franchise called RURONI KENSHIN, as some fans detested the retitling of this four-part very much adult drama Anime. I am not a huge fan of samurai-inspired flicks with blood-spurting violence (NINJA SCROLL gave me a huge stomach ache from its opening sequence of men getting sawed in half and/or ripped of their arms), nor did I ever see the TV show that this show is inspired from, however, this story about a young assassin whose murderous ways are transformed by his dealings with a beautiful woman (whose husband-to-be he unknowingly killed) is surprisingly decent. The animation is spectacular, rivaling that of Miyazaki's best works, and the characterizations are complex and deep. The OAVs were made after the TV show of the same title, however, this 2-hour tale is far from the lightheartedness of that show. This is a dark, brooding, and emotionally gripping effort that could almost be passed off as a live-action movie. In addition to which this is not a story for young children; there is plenty of violence and, yes, bloodspurting -- and some of the killings are often brutal to watch. However, the violence is artistically portrayed without ever being gratuitous, pretty much in the same treatment as PRINCESS MONONOKE. And I was very much moved rather than sickened by the time this show came to a close; it's no wonder SAMURAI X has such a loyal following.
I do not own this title; I merely watched it at an Anime club at college. The version I saw was dubbed (and not the ""Director's Cut"" as this title is labeled; just the four uncut OAVs). Considering that this dub was recorded by Monster Island Studios, who made the wonderful dub for NADIA: THE SECRET OF BLUE WATER, this dub for SAMURAI X sadly doesn't reach the same level of that former title. I cannot comment on any ""rewrites"", since I was unable to watch the subtitles. I will say, however, that the cast could have done a much better job. The problem isn't that the characters aren't well-voiced -- for the most part, the voices suit the characters quite well -- but the actors sound too much like they are just reading words instead of sinking into character. SAMURAI X's dub is not as horrendous as some purists scream, but it doesn't rank up with the better ones either.
That said, the colors on the DVD looked sharp and crisp, probably even better than the only ADV titles on DVD that I own (NADIA, EVANGELION). I don't think I'll add this title to my collection, but I do not at all regret watching it once at an Anime club. In fact, (despite the okay but not great dub) this title passes as a highly recommended title to watch, if but for the beautiful artistry.",1049673600,,2714,4.644490644490644
1845558,4,B00008G8PP,"Wow, I didn't actually think that ADV was going to release the directors cut in the USA.  Basically its the same thing as Trust and betrayal, except that the two episodes are combined into one 2 hour movie, and put into ""wide screen"" (Top and bottom are just cut off).  There are also a few extra scenes not included in the original version.  If you already own Trust and Betrayal I suppose its up to you if you want to fork out another 30 bucks to see a couple extra scenes or not (the whole ""wide screen"" thing is pointless since they just cut the bottom and top off).
You might want to check your local video rental store first.",1048809600,13,631,4.241666666666666
1845559,5,B00008G8PP,"I bought an import DVD of this title after having fallen in love with the original version. The director's cut has had all of the section breaks removed, letting the story flow as a continuous two-hour movie.
If you've never seen this OVA before, brace yourself. Its look and tone are almost completely different from the ""Rurouni Kenshin"" tv series and movie, with frivolity stripped away to yield a stunning examination of what happens to idealism when it's used to justify any means used to achieve those ideals. This OVA is not kid's stuff. It's violent and heart-rending and subtle, and you will never look at Kenshin the same way again.
It's probably best appreciated after seeing the second season of the tv series, which introduces a number of characters who also appear here. And once you've grown accustomed to the way Kenshin behaves ten years after the war, it's truly eye-opening to see the way he was and how/why he changed to what he later became. However, it can also be watched on its own, without having seen any other RK at all.
Some new footage was added to bump the runtime back up, but most of it is in tiny snippets that don't add much, with the spectacular exception of a battle sequence near the end where Kenshin fights his way across a bridge toward an artillery-besieged town. (By contrast, much more footage was added to the director's cut of Seisouhen (Reflections), including Kaoru's wedding and early married life, but no US release date has been announced for that as yet.)

1845626,4,B00008G8PP,"Early story of Kenshin of how he started and choices he had to make. A beautiful and detailed anime. I am not going to go into details of the story for risk of spoilers and it seems the other reviewers have already done so. No, it is not like the TV series. It does not look like it and it is not as light as it. Where the TV series is more kid friendly, this anime is not. It is dark and has more of a realistic feel to it. To be honest, I saw this first before I saw any of the TV series. I was actually quite disappointed that the TV series was nothing like this. So the ones who loved the TV series may not like this. But if you were not fond of the TV series, then there is a chance you will like it.",1398124800,,705,3.738255033557047
1845627,1,B00008G8PP,"I don't understand how anyone that has read or watched the kenshin series could enjoy this. They butcher the characters terrible. I do agree that animation is good, for the most part, but the eyes, faces, and voice acting were All dead.

If I hadn't already loved Kenshin from the tv anime I would not have cared about what happened to any of the characters. The same goes for Reflections. The voice acting was better but what they did to Kenshin and Kauro was tragic. I was happy then that it wasn't MY kenshin being portrayed in this series.",1395100800,,543,4.484848484848484

It's the North American import of Rurouni Kenshin, and it is one of the handful of animes that you can show to anyone without fear that they will think it is childish or somehow lacking. Amazing art, beautiful and tragic story, awesome movie all around.

I'm not going to try to compete with the other excellent reviews, I will just say that I am happy I saw this, and happy that I gave it as a present to a friend of mine. Beautiful work!",1388448000,,465,4.224719101123595
1845630,4,B00008G8PP,"Trust and Betrayal was AWESOME! It was such a shock seeing Kenshin at his prime during the height of the revolution, before he abandons his ways as a killer and instead vows to never kill again; it was like night and day. And Reflections is HORRIBLE, I wish that I could have unseen the end to Himura Kensin... It definitely did not do him justice. Reflections is not a part of the Kenshin saga as far as I am concerned.",1384819200,,420,4.2625
1845631,5,B00008G8PP,"""The moon peers down on a diseased world. There is no cure for the disease, an entire race walks mindlessly into destruction. Not even a man of colossal power, would be able to prevent the inevitable.""

Every choice has a consequence, and every action will cause a reaction that will impact you whether realize it or not, and the decisions by the characters in Trust and Betrayal, but by more importantly the legendary Himura Kenshin will shape a nation for years to come, and cause a great deal of pain and suffering in his own life. For those of you unfamiliar with the character Himura Kenshin, he is the creation of acclaimed Japanese manga artist and author Nobuhiro Watsuki. Nobuhiro Watsuki likes to use real life characters and events for his stories, and very loosely basis Himura Kenshin on Kawakami Gensai. Himura Kenshin is a former Choshu assassin said to be the greatest swordsman every, who mysteriously disappeared right after the Tokugawa Shogunate fell in 1867. The Manga takes place eleven years later in 1878 with Kamiya Kaoru searching for the legendary manslayer that has been killing innocent people and saying he was using the Kamiya Kasshin-ry style of swordsmanship. She accidently runs into a wandering swordsman with a reverse blade sword who has taken a vow to never kill again. Watsuki creatively combined the real world of late 19th century Japan with his story, and through his twenty eight volume manga, and Kenshin and Kaoru's memorable journey together Watsuki creates one of the best manga story lines ever along with some of their most well written characters ever, so it is not surprising that Studio Deen would be interesting in creating a Anime series based on the manga, which gave life to the wonderful ninety five episode anime series Rurouni Kenshin. Still there was lots of interest in Kenshin's past before the Meji Restoration while he was an assassin and Trust and Betrayal gives viewers the insight into Kenshin Himura's early years.

The quote above by the character Hiko Seijr is a fitting quote for the mid-19th century Japan. The Tokugawa Shogunate had basically had absolute control of Japan for over two hundred years ruling by fear and hostage taking. That is the simplistic version, but it gets the point across. The Shogun was the voice of the Emperor and there was no dissention ever with any dissention leading to imprisonment or death. In the 19th century things began to change with the class system and the restrictions the Shogunate put on each class began to boil over, and then there was the Shogunate's policy of isolationism. Outside of the Dutch, Japan refused to have any dealings with the outside world. That quickly changed in the 18th century with Imperialism. England was had defeated China in the first Opium War, Russia was encroaching on Japan's territory and then there is the United States which had its eyes on the Pacific and Japan. This would lead to the infamous ""Black Ships"" and the arrival of Admiral Perry who forced the Shogunate to open the country to all foreign nations. This embarrassment and insult would lead civil war and the collapse of the downfall of the Shogunate as many different sides and factions fought for control of Japan, which is when Trust and Betrayal takes place.

At the outset of Trust and Betrayal we follow a group of travelers traveling down small road when they are brutally attacked by bandits leaving just a small child alive, and it looks like the child will be killed along with his fellow companions when Hiko Seijr who easily dispatches with the bandits, but does not help the boy just basically saying this is life deal with it and walks away thinking nothing of the boy that is until Seijr finds the child standing in front of freshly buried graves where the boy has not only buried his companions, but also the bandits as well. Seijr agrees to take the boy on as his disciple and asks the boy his name, and in reply the child says his name is Shinta. This is the first defining moment in Shinta soon to be Kenshin's life. Through Seijr and his Hiten Mitsurugi-ry style of swordsman ship would lead Kenshin to become one of the greatest swordsman and killers ever. The second defining moment of Kenshin's young life takes place a few years after he has left Seijuro Hiko's tutelage to try and make a difference for the people and Japan where Kenshin ends up working for the Choshu clan as their best assassin. Through them he encounters Kiyosato Akira a young samurai guarding a local shogun official, and though Kenshin is victorious in killing the official and Akira, Kenshin is left scarred and the consequences of his actions would come back to haunt him. That theme is carried out throughout the OVA and impacts not only Kenshin, but all the characters in the anime. How our choices we make may not think wrong or won't impact anyone else may leave lasting and even devastating impact on those affected by those decisions along with the ones who made them. Kenshin is socially awkward having physically grown up, but not emotionally, and though he knows about the harshness of the world Kenshin is also nave when it comes to interacting with the world and trying to change it, which Seijuro tries to point out to his young pupil. Katsura Kogor the leader of the part of the Choshu clan regrettably takes advantage of this fact. The third defining moment that would influence perhaps be the greatest influence on his life and lead to his vow never to kill again is when Kenshin falls in love, but I will not give anything more away about what happens later in the OVA for those who haven't read the manga any of the anime series or films, but like Nobuhiro Watsuki did with the manga Studio Deen and writer Masashi Sogo creates a beautiful Greek Tragedy that again creatively combines historical events in Japan with the story of Kenshin to create a tragic, heart wrenching and truly emotionally satisfying anime OVA that can stand against any live action or anime film, TV series or OVA.

The animation is somewhat outdated by todays standard of animation, but it isn't that noticeable and Trust and Betrayal is beautifully animated with great painstaking detail put into each character and scene. The action in Trust and Betrayal is riveting and violent, which is a testament to Studio Deen's historical detail, and the scenes were brilliantly planned out and animated. The OST was created by Taku Iwasaki who compiles a dramatic and movie score highlighted by ""The Wars of the Last Wolves"" and ""In Memories 'A Boy Meets the Man'"" that compliments and the action and emotional moments of the anime scenes, and creating one of the most beautiful anime soundtracks around. I am not really a big fan of dubbed anime films or films in general as I prefer subtitles, but the English voice actors do a relatively good job with the film as did the translators, so I don't think it will effect anyone viewer if they watched it dubbed or with subtitles.

There are many quality anime films, series and OVA's around, but few have true meaning behind their stories or successfully delivers their message. I can think of a few like Now and Then/Here and There, Kino's Journey and Fullmetal Alchemist to name of a few. Rurouni Kenshin: Trust and Betrayal is another. The historical OVA perfectly blends the turbulent times of mid-18th century Japan and fiction to create an exceptional heart wrenching tale about the consequences of our actions and how killing isn't the answer to resolving conflicts, and how death slowly eats away out the soul of the killer, and that along with dated, but still wonderful animation, great action and beautiful music. You don't have to know anything about the character Himura Kenshin or have read the Manga as Trust and Betrayal is an origin story, which makes Trust and Betrayal a must for any anime fan or anyone who is a fan of cinema, for you must experience the birth of one of the greatest and well written characters ever created.",1370995200,,7991,4.779305354558611

1845633,5,B00008G8PP,"I came across this movie when I was searching for good quality anime.  This is a brilliant but tragic story, beautifully animated, and very well written.  You do not have to be familiar with the anime series to enjoy or to be able to follow this movie.  I have never watched the series before this movie and since then I have watched only a few episodes of the series, however, besides explaining how the main character received his famous scar, the similarity between the two ends there.  While this movie's tone is very dark and serious the series is far more comical and lighthearted. They are also animated very differently.  I highly recommend this movie, especially if you like dramatic and tragic stories.  I am glad that I had not heard of the series before I saw this movie so that I could judge it on it's own merits instead of comparing it to something I was already familiar with.  Simply put this movie is brilliant and stands on it's own as a masterpiece.",1339286400,2,969,4.5344827586206895

It has its slow parts and its fast paced parts but everything is the way it is for a reason and it all flows together really well. The animation is beautiful and smooth and the fight scenes are amazing. Once I got it in the mail I watched it twice in the same day. I don't regret this purchase at all.",1316736000,,417,4.097560975609756
1845655,5,B00008G8PP,"If I had to use one word to describe Trust & Betrayal, it would be ""haunting."" The soundtrack is as beautiful as anything I've ever heard. The animation is so good that I stopped the film in parts to debate with myself whether or not they used actual photographs of blossoms and trees and meadows. The bloodshed is brief, but dreadfully graphic and expressive of the cruelty that had taken over Kenshin's mind before he met Tomoe. And the love story of Kenshin and Tomoe was so deeply thought-provoking that I don't think I will ever stop coming back to it.

It helps to be familiar with the manga and/or anime before watching this film, but I think it could be equally rewarding to go on to the rest of Kenshin's story and see how it ends. I personally don't bother with Samurai X: Reflection, because it was not written by the creator of Kenshin, Nobuhiro Watsuki. He checked the script but did not like it and it is not considered canon. I prefer the way Watsuki ended the manga, with Kenshin happy with his family and friends. But this movie, although so dark and tragic, is worth seeing and will definitely give an added depth to the later story of Kenshin.

Other reviewers have advised avoiding the English dub, but I would advise the opposite. I never would have thought voice actors could be so evocative of the story-certainly they are important, but I was blown away by the English cast, particularly J Shannon Weaver, who voiced Kenshin. He made Kenshin's voice so flat and expressionless in the beginning, then you could hear Kenshin coming to life in the little mountain home he shared with Tomoe. After her death, the flatness was back in Kenshin's voice, but you could also hear the pain in every word. What an amazing job this man did-I would definitely recommend giving the English dub a chance.

All in all, this is a movie that can stand on its own as a great piece of art and I would rank it among the greatest movies of all time. When something is this beautiful and thoughtful, the form doesn't matter. All that matters is the feeling it gives you. Trust & Betrayal will touch your heart whether you're a fan of anime or you've never heard of it.",1315180800,,2169,4.513994910941475

Just know that this ova is much more gritty and ""real"" than the more popular ruroni kenshin- the characters look much more serious, and the dialogue is much more poetic, and of course tons of blood and gore and violence. if you want an ova or any anime to make you cry and stick to you for the rest of your life, make it this one.",1311292800,,963,4.127659574468085

1845659,1,B00008G8PP,"Review of Samurai X- Trust & Betrayal.
Wherever I go, this is one of the highest ratest animals titles fans choose as one of their favourites. On Anime News Network, it has been ranked in the top ten for several years running along massive greats such as Death Note and Princess Mononoke. How could I, coming fresh from the Rurouni Kenshin series and loving it, possibly not grab this title?

Well I did, and to say that I am frankly baffled by how anime fans constantly hail it a masterpiece would be the understatement of the century. I'm sorry, but it showed no sign of greatness. Not a bit.

Why? Firstly the english dub. It wasn't bad. It was painful. Dialogue was stilted and slow (this might be true of the sub too) and plain awkward. Everybody sounded bored. In a move of utter ignorance which insults the fans, nobody told the cast how to pronounce japanese words - so listen up for some hilarious cringe-worthy stinkers. Also, annoyingly the cast is different from the series dub because a different studio licensed it. You might argue this point is unfair, but it still detracted from my enjoyment to hear anyone other than the lovely Richard Hayworth handling our fearsome samurai protagonist.

The story only tried to be complex to cover up the fact that it was ultimately forgettable. Why is it even in two parts?? Kenshin slashes a lot of people, meets a pretty, mysterious girl, *spoilers!!!* pretty girl betrays him, he slashes some more people, then pretty, mysterious girl predictably dies in his arms. Damn, I could not have cared less. Just why are we supposed to believe that he fell in love with Tomoe? Everything went from unemotively wooden to phony-tragic, and we are supposed to care that she died, or believe that there was chemistry between them that was never actually shown on screen? No, it doesn't work like that. Don't insult my intelligence, writers. The thing that makes me dislike Samurai X the most was that when something is good, you remember it, don't you? Like a certain scene that stays in your head? Nothing about this at all stayed with me, other than the gruesome sight of guys getting hacked in two (note - this should probably have racked up an 18 certificate, it is WAY more violent than the series). I felt nothing - not least for the Battousai, who if not for the red hair and eventual cross-shaped scar, you would not even guess was the younger version of the beloved anime hero. It is so divorced that it feels like an ill-concieved spin-off.

This was something I wish I hadn't wasted money on. I'll stick with the bittersweet humour/action of the tv series anytime.",1276387200,3,2620,4.6645021645021645

Fans of the TV series should enjoy this, as long as they are prepared to see Kenshin when he wasn't such a great hero.  The animation style is different, it's more realistic.  This movie is violent and dark, but it's really moving and definitely got me crying.  By comparison, the TV series is more light-hearted.  There isn't really any humor in this movie, so be prepared.",1244851200,,476,4.552941176470588
1845661,5,B00008G8PP,In asking a friend what their favorite movie was he said this one. I had never heard of it so he lent his copy to me to watch over the weekend. What struck me as most obvious was how closely the plot follows Joseph Campbell's description of the necessary steps on the hero's quest. A quick search on Google shows these two topics do a dance with one another on lots of pages. So this point is nothing new. It may very well account for the power the movie has - the plot follows the ideal map of the hero's quest very closely. It is fascinating how following Campbell's map seems to insure such dramatic interest.,1238284800,,612,4.2844827586206895
1845662,4,B00008G8PP,"Noburo Watsunuki probably had no idea just how popular ""Rorouni Kenshin"" would be. What started out as a manga became a long running TV series and has spawned a major animated movie. ""SAMURAI X Trust and Betrayal Director's cut"" (aka. Ruroni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku roman tan: Tsuioku hen) is the precursor to the TV series, and tells the origins of the assassin called Kenshin Himura. Both ""Trust and Betrayal"" have been edited together, combining the 4 OVA episodes into one coherent movie. If you've seen ""Reflections"" then you will need to see this installment to fully understand the roots of its story. The film is based on the ""Romantic Tales of the Meiji Era"" and scenes were added to give the script a lot more continuity and more detail.

A samurai in his purest form were built upon a technique that is as much a science as an art form. A samurai would live and die under his code of Bushido--they embraced art, culture and were philosophers in their own right. I loved the classic samurai tales of Kurosawa, Kobayashi and Okamoto. Director/writer Kazuhiro Furuhashi along with screenplay by Masashi Sogo has captured the spirit of the chambara classics and essence of the romantic classics in anime form. Telling fictionalized origins but partly based on true accounts, this is the story of Hitokiri Battousai--the man who kills men like a demon.

During an attack by bandits, a young boy named Shinta was rescued by a highly skilled swordsman named Seijuro Hiko. Touched by the boy's passion and sense of justice, he trains the young boy in the teachings of the Mitsurugi style of swordplay and renames him Kenshin Himura. Kenshin (voiced by Mayo Suzukaze) is an idealist, very pure in his beliefs in creating a better world. Kenshin is recruited by the leader of the Choshu clan to perform acts of political assassination, and he becomes the most feared assassin in Kyoto. However, Kenshin's soul is becoming as war torn as the battlefields of Japan--his bloody work slowly stripping away his humanity. Kenshin still hopes for peace and finds his hopes personified in a beautiful woman named Tomoe (voiced by Junko Iwao) who shows him a life beyond the sword. Sadly, Tomoe is also torn by ghosts from her past. Can Kenshin and Tomoe save each other and find happiness?

The film's backdrop is set during a civil unrest in 1864. Different factions are in a struggle for power and the ruling Shogunate is known for enforcing abrasive laws. The Shinsengumi are the enforcers of the governing body and they are tasked in quelling rebellions before they come to fruition. All clans have their own brand of justice and they all believe they have a noble cause. Such is the Choshu clan to which Kenshin is affiliated with, they believe their cause is honorable and Kenshin lends his sword to their brand of justice.

While the show does have its levels of political intrigue, and has the usual elements of honor, duty and loyalty; the film focuses on Kenshin. His emotions, doubts and hopes take center stage, as well as his relationship with Tomoe. I really liked the detailed execution of the screenplay and the structure of its storytelling. It just so full of emotions and I was very impressed. Director Furuhashi knew exactly what he was going for, and while the story itself isn't wholly original, I couldn't help but be very involved with its storyline. Hatred and revenge, disappointments, love and redemption--betrayal, loss and tragedy are the film's main strengths. The film has a very serious tone and the animated cinematography is both beautiful and sad, with some use of metaphors and symbolism, fitting to the film's main premise. The film just manages to flesh out and define each and every emotion (or shifts in emotions) to give a fine narrative impact.

The film also has an abundance of swordplay. The fights are exquisitely animated and very bloody--the usual Japanese trademark of splattering blood is used to emulate its violence and brutality. Heads are stabbed, bodies are cut in half, necks are slashed, blood is sprayed. The film is perfectly animated and the camera shots are quite similar to jidai geki films such as ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" and ""Azumi"". The action is nicely placed and each encounter carries a lot of expressive impact and at the same time, cold and visceral. The scenes of violence and brutality is an inherent part of the plot and not unwarranted as with some other anime who uses this effect as a gimmick. It is not your kid's anime.

Those who are used to the animation in the ""Rurouni Kenshin"" TV series may be taken aback. Its style is quite different and has no over-expressive bulging eyes. The colors are occasionally muted to convey its mood, although some shots are colorful but nonetheless retains a dark and gloomy atmosphere. The eyes and facial expressions show a lot of humanity--when a character is in emotional pain, the camera will linger a bit to make the viewer feel the running emotions. The rendering is simple and while not exactly as accurate (clothes and hair styles) historically, it maintains an anime style, but it didn't hamper the film even one bit. The music is also quite enthralling and goes nicely with each scene to reflect the mood.

""Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal"" is a very good film. It is not perfect but it is just so entertaining and touching in its execution. It succeeds in delivering much needed emotions and has given anime fans a good reason to celebrate. It can satisfy action fanatics and delivers an intelligent, cleverly structured samurai drama. Its subtle touches in wordplay, metaphors and melodrama are well-balanced that proved to be a very good re-watch. The film has definite replay value and is a fantastic companion film to the TV series. This animated film will make you love the TV show even more and will make you a fan if you`re not.

Deeply tragic and quite beautiful in structure, this anime movie is Highly Recommended! [4  Stars]",1235174400,,5947,4.8339882121807465

1845664,5,B00008G8PP,"I own this movie personally and I have to say that this is one of the best samurai movies ever. There are a lot of great fight scenes and the storyline is very easy to follow. The music is exceptional and flows nicely with the movie. The overall artwork and animation is superbly well done.

This movie tells the tale of Kenshin and how he became an assasin working for the rebellion. It expands upon it a little further and the events that happened afterwards that turned him into a wandering samurai later on in the anime series. The plot is ""WONDERFUL"" and leads up to ""AN UN-EXPECTING TWIST IN THE END"". It's the ending that I love best about this movie ""BECAUSE IT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING SO CLEARLY"" and is the defining force that causes Kenshin to seek redemption for his sins.

I would not recommend this movie for children's because of a lot of the blood and the fight scenes that are in this movie. But I would recommend this movie to anyone else who loves a movie with a GREAT plot, a GREAT plot twist, well-developed characters, beautifully orchestrated music, extrodinary sword fights, and wonderfully drawn anime.

1845704,5,B00008G8PP,"I really enjoyed both of these movies; however, I would not recommend this to someone who has not followed the Rurouni Kenshin Series. If you have not seen the Rurouni Kenshin Series - primarily Arcs 1 & 2 - I would recommend holding off on purchasing this DVD set. If you watch these without watching the first two Arcs, you will most likely not enjoy the movies; and more importantly, in the case of Reflections, they will ruin the series for you.

Now I know a lot of people get confused about the order of the Series & OVAs, so I'd like to clarify the issue. As far as I know, this is how it goes (If I am wrong, feel free to correct me):

Arc 1 = Introduces the Main Characters

Arc 2 = The Shishio Story

Arc 3 = Consists of several ""Mini Stories"" (They seem like filler episodes)

Arc 4 = The Enishi Story (This Arc was never animated)

Trust and Betrayal is the Kenshin story that takes place before Arc 1 - This story really describes the events and tragedies that cause Kenshin to become the Kenshin we know from the series.

Reflections takes places after Arc 4 - This story is a recap of the Kenshin story (hints the name ""Reflections"") and ultimatley concludes the Kenshin story.

Theses DVDs are a lot more violent and serious when compared to the action/comedy series. The mood is completely different from the series. They are very ""emotional"" and really allow you to ""feel"" and ""understand"" the characters (Another reason why I recommend watching the series first). If you are a huge Kenshin fan like me who loved the series and always wondered what happened before and after the series, then I would highly recommend purchasing this DVD set.",1169856000,,1659,4.506666666666667
1845705,5,B00008G8PP,"I watched this first, then bought the TV series, which is quite enjoyable, and not quite as dark and depressing as this movie.  However, the art work is just beautiful, and the voice acting is well done.  The power of the Samurai code and of love itself is palpable in this film, and I will watch it many more times!",1154822400,,316,4.25
1845706,5,B00008G8PP,"Okay where to begin. First off for the two of you who don't know Samurai X are the oavs that are extensions to the manga Rurouni Kenshin. The reason it is not named that is because the animated version ofthe tale is published by a different company. Trust and Betrayal takes place during the main characters youth. Though the movie can be watched seperately it is best enjoyed after watching the first and second season of the anime series or the first 15 or so mangas volumes.

First off three warnings. One if your like happy light simple anime, look else where Samurai X trust and betral are anything but happy light and simple. Second though not essentual you should have some knowledge of the samurai code of honor, it helps a great deal when it come to motives behind the characters. And lastly and perhaps most importantly this film is not for children, this is not because there is anything objectably besides gore in the film, rather the stroy if so complex and subtle children simply won't understand what's going on.

Now on to the actual review. Samurai X Trust and Betral is simply put perfection incarnate and one of the few anime ever made that can stand beside legendary series like Neon Genesis Evangleion and the like and not be out of place. The story takes place during the beginnings of the Japanese revolution that began the Maji Restoration and fouces upon a assassin named Kenshin Himura. I won't go into details about the plot however as i said this story is a true tragedy. Think Romeo and Juilet except with samurai and tens times more tragic. The story is very VERY sad and this is resounded in every aspect of the film, from the color scheme to the voice acting and music. Also there are alot of things going on behind the story and are rather subtle side in presentation. However if you truly grasp the more subtle things of the story you will find it to be one of the best stories ever written peroid.

On to the art. What can I say really other then that I have seen well over two hundred anime series and I yet to see anything say for a few Myhozoki films that even come close to the animation and art work. Yes it is that good even though only pastel colors are used these furhter reinforce the sense of tragdy. By traditional anime values the character are almost ugly however if not expecting that they are beautifully drawn, especially the faces and eyes.

To the music, hummm there have been few sounds tracks that fit whats happening on the screen so perfectly. Though for the most part sad it is beautiful music and if you can buy the sound track.

Next is the voice acting. The japanese actors are great however for one of the few times the english actors are actually better and fit the characters perfectly and hit every mark. The only problem is the mispronouncing of the main female character's name, which is somewhat frustrating but easily forgiven.

The characters are well thought out and unlike any others in all animedom. By the end of the film I could honestly say that I felt like I knew each of them on a personal level which is rare.

Lastly Samurai X trust and betrayal is one of the best stories ever put to paper or to the screen. I recommend everyone watch this film once they come of age. Especially during the teens years when kids are starting to ask why war and murder are bad things. This film gives a clear and definite answer, if somewhat complex. Now then enough talk go buy now, you'll at the very least like this one if not completely love it.",1154563200,,3512,4.469578783151326

1845708,5,B00008G8PP,"In this little boxset you have the rurouni kenshin trust/betrayal  and reflections both in their directors cut edition.

Story:

The first movie Trust and Betrayal talks about the past of Kenshin Himura, as the famous hitori battousai ""the manslayer"".

This is 10 years before the events of the TV series Rurouni Kenshin.

Reflections:

This somehow is a recount of key moments of the tv series, and provides a conclution to the story.

This about 15 years after the end of the tv series, kenshin is wandering again, and the people that loves him are waiting for him to return.

Packing:

2 slim cases in one slim cardboard box, the artwork is beautiful and the box is the best in quality and least for the animes that i have checked so far.

Video:

Beutiful, just beutiful, both movies are in widescreen, the image is perfect, the first movie have a darker feel and the animation is dark to give it full effect.

the last movie is glorious, wonderful colors and animation.

some people complain because the orginal ovas from trust and betrayal where on fullscreen and were chopped to make it widescreen.

Audio:

English 5.1 and japanese 2.0 make your choice, both soud good, but the 5.1 track sounds the best.

only have english substitles.

Extras:

only a few previews ana trailers for adv series.

1845709,4,B00008G8PP,"This is a great buy because you get the motion picture plus Betrayal and Reflection. The best of the three would have to be Betrayal, the other two have horrible voice acting and they're still good but Betrayal outshines them both. In Betrayal you get what every fan wants to know and that's Kenshins past and the story of how he got that crossed shaped scarr.

I truly love this Reflection and even though it is very good I can't escape the fact that these characters do not seem to be the same. Karou was not herself in reflection I know her love was deep for Kenshin but she seemed unreal, her love was deep for him in the series but she was still the funny, joyful, loud swordswoman she always was but with more love in her heart because of Kenshin. The same with Yahiko Megumi and Sanoske. It felt like Karou turned into Tomo Kenshins first wife, a soft-spoken loving caring wife who would never leave Kenshins side.

I'm very sure Karou would become something like Tomo but in her own way. Plus after what happened in the series with Yahiko taking kenshins sword to fight Gohei Hiruma the crazed idiot who would stop at nothing to kill Kenshin for breaking his thumb it looked as if Kenshin would never let Yahiko touch the reverse blade sword again. To end this it's hard to believe that all of the characters hardcore Rurounie Kenshin fans have come to love could change so much. In a way I don't know these people but overall reflection is a good story sad but good and the big change is it's only downfall. I agree with other reviewers because the animation is just unbelievable and I wish they could of used it for the series.",1140134400,,1637,4.417218543046357
1845710,2,B00008G8PP,"I would recommend that if you are considering purchasing this DVD, and are not familiar with, please do some background checking on it first. I would suggest you maybe watch the original show first (Rurouni Kenshin), or something else that will make you care more about the characters and what's happening to them.

This is a very depressing OVA. It's sad and is filled with merciless violence. We are not spared with cut-a-ways at all. For those of you who tend to like your anime a little on the lighter side, this isn't for you.

I think an anime is great when it pulls you in and you feel what the characters are feeling, you identify with them and cheer for them, you cry for them. I did not feel drawn to any of the characters in this anime. Even though it was sad, I never felt sad for the main characters, I just felt sad because the overall tone was gloomy and it was depressing to watch tons of innocent people get killed in crude ways. Also, as soon as I started to care a little for the main character, Kenshin, the story took a turn for the worst, and I didn't bother trying to care anymore. Additionally, the second part of this OVA (Reflection), to me, is just as depressing and over romanced. I feel like the creators are almost trying to force me to care and feel distraught over the ""burden"" and ""struggle"" of the samurai and those in his life... I wasn't feeling it.

Visually, the anime is a treat, (aside from all the blood being sprayed everywhere). The scenes have a gritty overtone to them and it reminded me of the more old school animes, where that ""not-so-polished"" look is a good thing. The visuals also instantly reminded me of ""Grave of the Fireflies,"" (which is another depressing, suicide fest).

Bottom line: If you enjoy relentlessly violent, bloody and depressing samurai melodramas, this OVA is surely for you. If you're wavering about buying this, don't just buy it based on the other reviews on this page that say this DVD is gold. Please do some research for yourself. It's all a matter of taste... and my taste says no.",1139270400,3,2059,4.497326203208556
1845742,5,B00008G8PP,"Five minutes into the OVA, I was hooked. Rarely do I ever become so emotionally involved with the story and the characters. The dialogue was mature and philosophical. I won't tell you any part of the story because it has been elaborated on from the other reviewers. I purchased this Director's Cut version not too long ago and overall I am very pleased due to the entire story continuing seamlessly but there were some minor dialogue changes that I thought was inaccurate from the originals. I recommend this version but I would highly recommend the original Trust and Betrayal DVDs due to the exactness of the dialogues as a whole.",1139184000,2,632,4.754545454545455
1845743,5,B00008G8PP,"In my humble opinion, there has not been another anime OVA to rival that of the Kenshin one.  This OVA is simply a stunning work of art that had me staring blankly at my tv for 5 minutes after finishing it.

I would advise you to cautiously read the rest of the reviews for this, as they contain huge spoilers.  There is no way to detail the plot without spoiling, but to give you the general idea:  Shinta is a small boy who witnesses the horrendous slaying of his ""family"" that trys to protect him.  A man skilled in swordmanship saves shinta from the murderers, and decides to undertake him as a pupil to his swordsmanship style.

While Shinta is growing up, Japan is embroiled in an internal conflict between the Ishin Shishi Patriots and the Bakufu Shogunate.  Most out there would not really posses the knowledge needed to understand the conflict, but the movie will generalise it enough to clue you in on what's happening.  The real shogunate war was actually much more detailed and the distinctions of good and evil were blurred much more than they are here, but that is something the TV series delves in more.

But I digress. Shinta, renamed Kenshin, wishes only to help people with his sword arts, and the only way he can see to do that is to join the patriots in their liberation of the country's peasents from the tight rule of the shogunate.  He joins the Patriots in their struggle, becoming their assasin.  Eventually, he has a runin with a woman named Tomoe, and by a sad turn of events they are forced to retreat to the countryside to avoid the eyes of the imperialists.  Kenshin's soul is torn from the murders he has commited, and Tomoe is torn from the demons of her past.  Can love save them?

Trust and Betrayal is a story of right and wrong, of war, of death, of neccessary evil, of love, healing, hurting, and forgiveness.  It raises several questions about human emotions that will make you ponder at its emotionally riveting ending.

Retreating back from emotion for a while, I'll go into the mechanics of the movie.  The soundtrack is beautiful, and unlike the tv show (imo of course) fits the scenes perfectly.  Traditional orchestral pieces fill in the background of the bloody Bakumatsu era, unlike the sometimes silly pop and rock of the tvshow.  The dub is ok, however the voices are oddly forced, and hearing american voices on geishas is a bit off.  As for visuals, this movie is absoltuely beautiful.  It is much darker, grittier, and bloodier than the tv show, as is only right for the story it tells.  Although it is unfortunatly, marred by the oddly placed CGI scenes.  These scenes are few and far between though, and in no way do they detract from the overall movie.

But this does not reveal the true strength of Trust and Betrayal, which is its emotional impact.  This movie will pull at your heart, tugging it into your throat as you watch what Kenshin and Tomoe must suffer through.  The movie is violent and bloody, the pacing perfect during the kill scenes.  There is no lifting camera either, we see Kenshin's sword rip the flesh of his victoms, as he gets coated in their blood.  The violence all adds to the emotional impact of the movie however, and is never tasteless.  It is truly interesting to see how the scenes change when Kenshin is killing someone and when he is with tomoe.  When he is with Tomoe, the camera slows, as does the pacing, and your heart is given a respite in the tranquility of their simple lives.  The movie paces itself to your heart, it races as kenshin rips through his targets over and over and over again, and it slows as he talks to Tomoe and walks with her.  It is good directing, and I'd like to see what the director could do with live action, as opposed to anime.

Trust and betrayal will leave you reeling at the end.  It is an emotional roller coaster ride, and it will change your outlook completely.  This is a warning to those of you who have seen the kenshin series, do not expect any normality.  For those of you that have never seen the kenshin series period...well, this ova was meant to be viewed after the second season.  If you choose to watch kenshin directly after that, you will not be able to look at the story the same way, and Kenshin will appear much, much more tragic than he should in the first part.  I watched it personally before viewing the anime series, and I rather wish i had waitied.  However, it is no big deal, and i eventually grew to accept kenshin as he was portrayed in the TV series.

At some point in your life, however, you owe it to yourself to see this OVA.  I cannot give it enough praise, the only way to do it justice  is to see it yourself.",1138752000,2,4668,4.462809917355372
1845744,5,B00008G8PP,"...Words do not do it justice. I bought this DVD (rather, the Director's Cut Package that contained ""Reflection"" as well) with a heap of other DVDs a few days ago. When I got home, I popped it in, not knowing anything about it save for the fact that it was a samurai anime.

  I've watched plenty of anime in my time, and am a huge film buff as well. Which is why I was surprised that within the first ten minutes of the film, I was so overpowered by the images, music, and tone that I was almost brought to tears. Quentin Tarantino once said of ""Chunking Express"" that he cried, not because the film was sad, but because he was just so happy to love a movie so much. I've never had such an emotion. But that all changed the other night. I wept for such a reason.

  For all my life I have been searching for a certain kind of anime. One that didn't contain ridiculous sweat beads, cavernous mouths, and the occasional goofy dialogue. It's the nature of the beast, and I've dealt with it, just hoping that at some point in my life one would fall into my lap that met these requirements. Sure, films like ""Grave of the Fireflies"" seemed to fit, but they were realistic tales that just happened to be animated. This film, this wonderous, amazing film is the one I've been waiting for. And oh, so much more.

  The story, dialogue, action, music, editing, animation, it all flows so effortlessly. I have fallen in love with this beautiful tale of an assassin and his ""sheath."" I would reccommend it to anyone who understands human emotion, has a love of anime, or just a love of great storytelling. Those of you out there who require the in your face, John Woo, techno beat scored action of so many anime series and films out there will not find much to love in ""Trust and Betrayal.""

I really enjoyed the Kenshin series as much as the movie, but the down part is that if you watch the movie before the series, it really 'destroys the magic' of the series.  So if you want to get this movie, then get the series first.

Graphics are unbelievable.  Unlike the series, the graphics are much improved.  Though, growing up and watching the series, I kind of missed the old graphics.  But in parts of the movie they'll combine real-life footage and animated footage together.

Audio-wise, the movie really excels to it's limits comapered to the series.  The music was very well chosen to progress the story, as was the sound effects.  The voice acting was very good, except for some weak lines.

The are no special features on the DC version, except for the extended scenes that are already put into the movie.

The down part about this movie overall is that if you watch the movie and then the series, it will really make the entire series a waste to watch.  But with that note aside, I give Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal (DC Version) four stars out of five.

1845748,5,B00008G8PP,"This move is an OVA based on the Rurouni Kenshin series.  As many have already said, it's a prequel.  That doesn't, however, mean it should be viewed before the series which caused its creation.  Though it can be viewed as an introduction, it is much more effective if seen after the watcher has come to know the character called Himura Kenshin. (I will warn that there may be some spoilers ahead)

Trying to describe this is difficult.  It is one of my absolute favorite animated films.  The color, the movement, and the music create a wonderul mood and atmosphere, giving the movie a tone far different from that of the TV series.  The story is riveting if one is able to see its meaning and look through the violence.

Set during the Bakumatsu, Samurai X follows Himura Kenshin, an asassin for the Choshu clan, and tells the story of how he recieved the scar for which he is known.  Though it is a love story, it captures the chaos and conflict of the times in a brilliant fashion.  The Ikedaya Inn scene is particularly well done and both the Choshu and Shinsengumi are well portrayed.

The movie is depressing at times as it is filled with tradgedy.  Tomoe, who becomes a very signifigant character, is also a key factor in the story.  After wandering to Kyoto in search of her fiance's murderer, she comes upon Kenshin in the rain, who has just finished a fight with a bloody conclusion.  From there, things get a bit strange.  Tomoe is enigmatic and confused.  A perfect example of one struggling with their emotions and love.  She unconciously falls for the asassin and ends up attempting to withdraw from the conspiracy which she helped carry out.

Do not judge the movie just because it is violent.  It is engrossing and offers a peek at Japanese history.  Though a love story, there is much action and gore.  An implied sex scene is there too, so this movie would have attained an R rating in theatres.

Some things I would like to say, though: 1) You need to be able to pay attention to enjoy this movie 2) It is a bit slow in the second half, but give it a chance 3) The Directors Cut is just Trust and Betrayal in one package, purchase only if you don't own the two already, and 4), I would recommend watching this in Japanese with English subtitles.

Purchase or rent this animated masterpiece.  It gives a darker tone to the Kenshin series and another reason to enjoy it.",1125878400,2,2387,4.497674418604651
1845749,4,B00008G8PP,"Known in America as Samurai X, the four-episode OVA prequel to Rurouni Kenshin is widely acknowledged as one of anime's crowning achievements. A gripping story heavily rooted in historical fact, the episodes feature dynamic characters, incredible animation, and an impressive musical score; the 1999 direct-to-video series has a noble theatrical quality often likened to Akira Kurosawa's cinematic masterpieces. Simply put, it deserved to be made as a movie. Eventually the four episodes were cut together, supplemented with new animation, and released theatrically in Japan as ""Rurouni Kenshin: Reminiscence."" It makes its US debut on DVD as ""Samurai X: Trust & Betrayal Director's Cut,"" but short of seeing this in a theater, there is little reason for American fans to pick up this version over the OVAs.

In any incarnation the sheer brilliance of the production is obvious. Set ten years before the events of the Rurouni Kenshin television series, it trades up the cartoonish look and tone of its forerunner for harsh, uncompromising, realistic tragedy. The stylistic gap between the two series is immense; yet there is no feeling of inconsistency, as viewers of the TV series already know Kenshin's past was dark and violent. Not only does the prequel perfectly illuminate the history of an established protagonist, it is a fascinating and emotional character study in its own right. Kenshin goes from an idealistic youth to a cold-hearted killer, only to be redeemed through love lost and the realization that swinging his sword is destroying his own life as well as the lives of the people on the receiving end. His journey is at once tragic, uplifting, and totally convincing.

And the sword fights kick ass. Terribly bloody, they do not glamorize violence and portray the horror of warfare and murder for what it is. Yet they are beautiful works of art nonetheless. Fully-animated with an attention to detail to rival Disney, such a level of realism is seldom attained in animation. The gorgeous animation fuses with the equally beautiful storytelling in one of the few truly unforgettable anime viewing experiences.

But the new ""director's cut"" footage is a different story. The sequences made for the theatrical version are few and fleeting; most consist merely of an extra line of dialogue tacked onto a scene or an extra sword thrust in battle. Casual viewers of the OVA version will probably not notice any of them, and most will slip by even seasoned Kenshin fans. There are only two noteworthy additions. Kenshin's first fight against a member of the Shinsengumi has been fleshed out quite a bit; it is of course beautifully animated and adds even more power to an already dramatic scene. But an addendum to the closing moments of the film is less successful. Impressive as it is, Kenshin's lone charge over a heavily fortified bridge comes well past the emotional climax of the picture and slows down the ending. The new sequences are an exciting prospect, but much like the special editions of Star Wars or Beauty & the Beast they are ultimately extraneous. It's hard to improve upon perfection.

There are a few omissions as well--some of them necessary, some of them not. The picture of course had to be cropped to a theatrical aspect ratio, which often results in the tops of character's heads being cut out of the picture. The four individual episodes flow together quite nicely as they are, and only one new bridging sequence was needed; however the dramatic music from the closing moments of the first episode has been lost. This is an unfortunate but acceptable sacrifice for continuity's sake, but there are several other inexplicable musical omissions throughout the film. Taku Iwasaki's original score for the OVAs is just amazing and lends the productions much of its emotional impact. In the theatrical cut the menacing Battousai theme which sets the stage for Kenshin's fatal attack on Kiyosato is gone; the scene is not nearly as effective sans music and will leave a sour taste in the mouths of fans familiar with the original version.

Both the original Japanese and English cast members return to dub what precious few new lines of dialogue their characters have. J. Shannon Weaver does a good job with Kenshin and actually sounds very similar to Richard Hayworth, who performs Kenshin in Media Blasters' dub of the TV show. But ADV's dub of Samurai X plays loose with the translation, and the meanings of some crucial lines of dialogue are blurred. For example, in the Japanese version Kenshin explains his final mission to kill as something he simply must do; in English he specifically implies it is an act of vengeance. As series followers know, the word revenge is not in Kenshin's vocabulary, and diehard fans should stick to the subtitled version.

For a ""director's cut"" release, the DVD itself is pretty bare-bones. The picture quality is good enough but extra features are nonexistent. Even the historical notes, which provide valuable background information on the era for us gaijin, have been left off of this release. Just one more reason for fans to spend the extra money on picking up the two separate volumes of the OVA release versus the theatrical version.

Casual fans of Rurouni Kenshin, samurai action, or just plain good animation might as well save a few bucks and grab the Director's Cut. More serious devotees of Kenshin or specifically Samurai X will do better to pick up the individual installments of the OVA; you get the whole picture and all of that great music--much more valuable commodities than a few new snippets of animation. And if you already own the OVAs and just have to see the movie version. Trust me, a rental will do. Only the most anal-retentive fanboy need worry about owning both versions.",1119830400,19,5773,4.982365145228216
1845750,5,B00008G8PP,"First off, I must warn you that this movie is extremely violent. The television show, Rurouni Kenshin (especially the edited version) can be watched by children. It is at times violent, but not graphically so and includes much comedy. This movie is NOT for children. It tries to be as realistic as possible, so when they do things like cut a man in two, you  see (and hear) basically what it would be like if a man were cut in two. It's extremely violent and graphically so. If you wish to avoid graphic violence, don't come near this film. It's easily rated R in that respect, if not NC-17.

However, that aside, this film is nie on perfect. I have only seen the director's cut, so I don't know what the differences are from the original version, but this production is basically flawless. The animation is beautiful. The music is great and fits wonderfully. The dubbing is fantastic (I only watched the English dub, so I can't say much about the Japanese acting). Even the sound effects are awesome.

The title is ""Samurai X"" because ADV Films couldn't legally use the Rurouni Kenshin name since Anime Works had the rights to Rurouni Kenshin, the show. This also means that the voice actors are not those of the show, but there aren't very many characters here from the show so that doesn't change much and the actors that they have do a fantastic job.

As I said, the story is extremely violent, but just the same, that's not the focus of the story. Instead it focuses on Kenshin and on his choices in the time of the Revolution that lead to his becoming a Manslayer and then later to swearing never to kill again. The story mainly takes place during the time that Kenshin is the ""Manslayer in the Shadows"" and shows the events up to the point that he comes out of the shadows and into the open. The term ""manslayer"" is never actually used in this film. The Japanese term is ""hitokiri"" and at the end of the film it speaks of ""Hitokiri Battousai"" (i.e. Battousai the Manslayer). But throughout the film, Kenshin is referred to as ""The Assassin."" This greatly helped me to understand what being a manslayer means - or at least what one in the shadows is and does. I never saw a manslayer that killed lots of people as being particularly bad. It's war, that happens. That's what the manslayer in the open is, but the manslayer in the shadows is indeed an assassin (and thus arguably a murderer) and that helped me to understand why Kenshin was so unhappy about what he had done. The story does a wonderful job of showing why Kenshin did what he did and how it affected him. The extreme violence just serves to show how nasty it really was to be a manslayer. We are left with no doubt as to who and what Kenshin was and why he did what he did.

While the movie doesn't focus on the fighting, we get to see quite a bit of it and the Kenshin here pratically makes the one in the show look like a wuss. He's absolutely fantastic. About the only time in the show that he comes close to fighting at this level is when he's fighting Saito towards the beginning of the Kyoto Arc. The fight scenes are absolutely fantastic. After watching this, you'll just about have to agree with Saito that Kenshin the Wanderer is pathetic in comparison to the Battousai.

And of course this film shows the events that lead him to choose to throw away his sword - or at least choose a reverse blade one - and become that Wanderer. The events at the climax of the film form the most heart-wrenching scene that I have ever seen. It is pivotal point in Kenshin's life and an event that is absolutely crucial to understanding exactly why Kenshin became the Wanderer. That scene makes it totally and utterly clear as to why Kenshin changes. The film also shows how Kenshin got his famous cross-shaped scar and it actually forms a crucial role in the story.

As an interesting side note, this move really gets me interested in the history of Japan - particularly around the time of the Revolution. While the story is easily understood without understanding Japanese history, it's easy to see how crucial a role the politics of the time play on the story and how some of the events around the story would be easier to understand with a better understanding of Japanese society of the era. But as I said, the story focuses on Kenshin and understanding of the political and historical situation aren't really necessary.

However, I would advise that you have read or watched through the Kyoto Arc (second season) of Rurouni Kenshin before watching this movie. I'm sure that you could enjoy it without having done so, but there are a number of small things that wouldn't make quite make as much sense and much of it would have less meaning to you. For example, seeing Saito and what he's doing means a lot more to someone who knows who and what he is from having seen are read the appropriate part of Rurouni Kenshin.

If you are a true Rurouni Kenshin fan and don't mind the violence, this is a must see. As another reviewer said, you will never look at Kenshin quite the same again. This film really helps you to understand why he is the way he is.",1118102400,3,5118,4.46524064171123
1845780,5,B00008G8PP,"This is a dark, intensely emotion, and introspective movie that deserves to be considered among the best movies (animated or not) to come out of Japan. There is too much depth in the story to go into detail here, but I'll say that the movie has all of the elements of a great film. The characters are very deep and emotional, the action sequences are top notch and integral to the storyline and theme (not just random displays of violence), and the storytelling is absolutely brilliant. If you like the Kurosawa samurai films then you may like Samurai X.

As a word of caution, the TV series bears no resemblance to the OVA. The series revolves around the goofy antics of the cast and the way the hero uses superhuman sword fighting moves to defeat super human opponents. Basically the TV series plays out like a Saturday morning cartoon.",1114732800,2,838,4.624161073825503
1845781,5,B00008G8PP,"I loved this movie. The animation is superb (except in the few small scenes with intertwine real images with animation) and the story dark and chilling. Just for a note, this OVA (Original Video Animation) is properly titled Rurouni Kenshin OVA: Trust and Betrayal. Samurai X is an American title to catch buyers (just a note in case that turned you off).

Storywise, this is basically the story of a revolution against the tyrannical military-government in Japan, the Tokugawa Shogunate, a dictator who over-ruled the Emperor himself. Our anti-hero Kenshin's life is followed from his days as Shinta, and the meeting of his master, Hiko, to the end of his Hirokiri Battousai days. We have Kenshin as a little child, innocent with his top and memories of family, then Kenshin the brutal assassin for the Choshu (I believe that's who he worked for, haven't seen it in a few weeks) Clan, and finally we see Kenshin as the lover of Tomoe, a mysterious woman Kenshin meets after an ambush.

I don't wish to reveal the story any further. To sum up a recommendation, a dark and emotional story, superb animation (save the live action/animation shots which are minimal), a romance between two emotionally scarred people, fantasticly choreographied sword fights, and a two-for-one bundle. If this sounds like you, I bet you'd like Rurouni Kenshin OVA: Trust and Betrayal ""Director's Cut"" (Samurai X).",1105574400,4,1392,4.995689655172414
1845782,5,B00008G8PP,"This movie explains a LOT of questions you might have about the series. (But it doesn't explain the red hair...)

If you have seen the series, then you have seen some of the hidden torment that hides in Kenshin's heart. Despite the goofy ""cheerful"" animation, there IS darkness there.

Trust & Betrayal takes an innocent child and stains his hands with blood that will never be washed away. Kenshin trusted himself to follow the right path and always defend the innocent (as he himself had been defended) but in the end he learned that he had betrayed his morals and caused suffering in the lives of the true innocents: those who were left to bury the dead.

There is so much more that I could say, but I doubt anyone reading a review wants to hear my philisophical pyschobabble about a movie you possibly haven't even seen yet. Just keep in mind that this is so much more than a ""boy meets girl, boy kills a lot of people, girl tricks boy, boy kills no more"" story.",1104624000,2,966,4.446327683615819
1845783,5,B00008G8PP,"Anime that doesn't focus on action packed futuristic melo-drama is rare. The Samurai X OVAs bring to screen true period depictions of life as a wandering swordsman caught between the hero versus anti-hero manner of the waning Tokugawa Shogunate and the emerging neo-colonialistic Meiji Era.

  Packed with soul-renching scenes and dialog, Trust & Betrayal, embodies master story-crafting and animation. Fight scenes, blood and gore are matter of fact and skillfully woven into the story line without being obtusely ""required"" to add spice to an already rich tale.

  Although this Director's cut draws from the origins of the widely popular Rouroni Kenshin TV series, it does not depict the typical slapsticized misadventures with which many are familiar. Trust & Betrayal portrays a serious meta-play of circumstance, chance, discipline, endurance, forgiveness, and love.

  It isn't without flaw, however. English dubbing, though masterfully done, doesn't give justice to the emotion that can be detected within the original Japanese script. Setting an English dialog with English subtitles betrays the differences of translation loss, and in a few frames, the re-mastering of subtitles actually fails (some lines of original subtitles can be seen on film). These are minor imperfections, though, and forgivable given the breadth and scope of the story and art.

  Trust & Betrayal is best watched in its original Japanese dub with English subtitles. The story flows without distraction, and the souls of a wandering swordmaster and of those around him are given center stage.

  This is a masterful tale told with excellent artistic rendition that leaves a longing for more.

  Highly recommended for audiences 13 above with parental guidance for swordplay and violence. An excellent buy.",1098489600,7,1791,5.474452554744525

It is about a boy named Kenshin to some of us whose caretakers get killed. He gets saved by a master of the art of sword known as hiten-mitsurugi.
Its whole visual style is superb. And as everyone says ""they mix real life into it that makes it kind of silly"" well, they do but it doesnt ruin the movie.

1845785,3,B00008G8PP,"The 3 stars are in no way a reflection of the story, animation, or anything pertinent to the story. It is for this director's cut dvd of the original OVA's trust and betrayal.
This directors cut merges the ova's trust and betrayal. As mentioned by someone else, very little is added, but the reflection's ova directors cut should have more added when it's released in the US.
Reflections is the one that i thought really needed a director's cut. This is coming from someone who is a Rurouni Kenshin fan.
As far as this director's cut for betrayal and trust goes, I was hoping for more. This just felt like they took the breaks out of the original OVA's. When I hear the word's director's cut, I immediately think of restored scenes that the director was forced to cut for one reason or another. This felt like there were no restored scenes, except for the one that someone mentioned in another review above.
Another reason for it only getting three stars, is there are no extra's whatsoever on this disc. The only things they have are language selection, scene selection (Which has moving animation featured for each scene you can select. I always like this!) and lastly some trailers for other anime. There are no extra's!
Buy it? Or don't buy it? hmmm . . . If you're a die hard fan of Rurouni Kenshin, you will buy it without any need for me to coax you into doing so. If you're not a die hard fan, but already own all of the OVA's and are too lazy to use your remote from a sitting or laying down position to press a button to skip past the credits of one act to go into the next act then this is perfect for you!
It may seem like I'm exaggerating a bit, but I assure you I am not. The only thing this dvd offers is a breakless version of the original OVA's Trust and betrayal, and one noticable scene restoration. That's it!
I guess since I own the original and the director's cut, the one i would watch would depend on what mood I am in. If I wanted to show a friend who has some time to sit and watch a whole movie, I would show him the directors cut, and if I wanted to watch the OVA's and don't have time to watch it all in one sitting, I'd watch the original OVA's of trust and betrayal, which are broken up into four episodes.

It goes for more emotional depth and weight and achieves it magnificently. I like this animation style much better and the music is top-notch. The few parts where they integrated live action backgrounds w/animated backgrounds didn't bother me as much as it did other people, but it was definitely unnecessary.
The important thing about this is how Kenshin came to be the Battousai and what finally woke him from his numb killing mode to realize what he was doing was far from his idealized hopes. At the end of this he becomes the Kenshin everyone falls in love with in the TV animes. To me it was a great introduction to the character and now I want to see his other adventures and get to know the ""other"" Kenshin.

This is nothing like the Rurouni Kenshin series, as it is a lot darker, both in terms of lighting, color, and perspective. There is not a single hint of humor in it, but as the hero is a young assassin trying to come to grips with himself during the Japanese civil war, I don't see how there could be any funny parts. You WILL NOT be laughing at any point in this. IF you don't want to be in tears at the end, then don't watch this.
I have been a Rurouni Kenshin fan for years, so I thought that I would give this a try for the backstory on Kenshin and his life during the Bakumatsu. I knew it would be somewhat depressing, but I was put through the emotional wringer--and loved it. Every time I watch it I cry. It is that powerful.
This is the favorite in my collection. I have shown it to my mom, and she loved it as well. This is definitely for those mature people who want to see the definitive sad, moving love story. Betrayal, love, loss, pain (both physical and emotional), and ideals come into play in this wonderful film.
Kenshin joins the fight against wishes of his mentor and the warnings that he will be used by those in power, who will only want him for his incredible sword skills. Sure enough, his power and skills are abused by his superiors, who put him in the position of being their primary assassin. His ideals of honor, righteousness, and loyalty are skewed by his job as a murderer, and he begins to lose himself.
Enter Tomoe. She meets Kenshin by chance and begins following him around. They start to fall for each other, but there are too many secrets still hidden, and too much to overcome...

But the movie is NOTHING like the cartoon series.  That was my mistake, I was expecting the cartoon series. DON'T! Its a sad movie and not much humor is in it.
I am going to tell you the story but im not going to ruin it for you.  The story is this, Shinta was an orphan whose parents died of sickness so he was turned into a slave.  But his slave masters were attacked and he was saved by Hiko.  Hiko changed his name to Kenshin and taught him Hiten Mistourougi(I think thats how its spelled) syle of swordmanship.  Kenshin became an assassin.  Later he picks up a girl named Tomoe after being attacked. Time passes and then Kenshin's clan was attacked so he had to run.  The leader of Kenshins clan advises him to move out of town and pretend to be husband and wife with Tomoe.  That's only the first part but I can't really tell the second part without ruining the movie.  But this dvd explains how Kenshin got the cross-shaped scar on his cheek.
The movie is a sad movie but one of the best parts of the movie is the music.  The music can stay in your head for quite awhile.  Unlike the cartoon series, none of the music uses rock instruments(electric guitars, drumset, etc.) it uses classical music instruments.  So expect classical music.
There are some complaints, but not enough for me to give it 4 stars. First of all you can't really tell if when the first movie ends and the second begins.  Also the ending credits are in japanese and the subtitles won't tell you who helped to make this wonderlful movie.  I also thought there was going to be some more extra features but there isn't just previews to other anime movies.
As another reviewer had said before this is a hard movie to watch.  You have to be set to see a sad movie.  You also have to have a open heart or sorta interested into love stories or you won't see how sad and great this movie really is, but if you are you will feel the emotions of the movie and see the greatness of this movie.
Oh I almost forgot, this is both trust and betrayal put together, don't buy them separate or your wasting money, and if you do buy them separate ""Trust"" is a cliffhanger so you will be itching to get the ""Betrayal"" movie. Just buy this dvd so you can watch it in one sitting.
I hope this review helps you to go out and buy this movie, anime fan or not.",1073692800,2,2465,4.266666666666667
1845810,4,B00008G8PP,"Trust & Betrayal follows the life of Kenshin, from his youth as an orphan named Shinta, to his violent life as Battousai the manslayer, and then to his life as a man seeking atonement for his plentiful sins.
As an orphan, he sees the murder of the people presently caring for him, and is saved from getting killed himself by the man who will become his master.  Kenshin, however, abandons his master before his training is fulfilled in order to stop a corrupt government and fight for the ""good"" guys.  He kills without feeling, suppressing his emotions and conscience, and is the most effective assassin on either side.
And then he meets Tomoe, a woman everyone mistakes for a prostitute.  Unknown and unrealized to Kenshin, Tomoe is as much a pawn of the revolution as Kenshin himself is, being used by the opposition to exact revenge, as well as by his own people to ensure that he doesn't break down emotionally and become useless as a fighter.
Kenshin's fiercest struggles, however, are not physical.  It is too easy for this killing machine to defeat his opponent for the fight to ever be called into question.  His struggles only truly begin when he finally lives a normal life, and starts to question why he thought he could only be happy using his sword to kill for justice, asking himself if justice can ever be exacted through murder?
While the main premise of Kenshin is fascinating, the theme of atonement, and if good ends can ever be justified by evil means, my problem with the movie is that I don't think the relationship between Kenshin and Tomoe was developed enough to make me believe that Kenshin's existence with Tomoe was enough to begin his path to redemption and atonement.  While what happens at the end clearly would be a catalyst for a change, (I won't spoil it here by telling you,) I don't think I saw the type of romantic relationship between them that would make me believe they had fallen in love. I didn't see any sparks, only two people living a daily existence in a situation they were forced into.
Still, the Kenshin fan must see this DVD.  It fills in the blanks as to what caused Kenshin to become the manslayer, how he got the famous X-shaped scar, and what caused him to realize he needed redemption.  It also explains why Kenshin would be hesitant to ever embark upon another serious relationship- talk about get the wool pulled over your eyes and then the rug pulled out from under your feet in a matter of hours.  I do think the relationship between Kaoru and Kenshin in the series is much more believable, because Kaoru is a character I could see Kenshin falling in love with, smart, strong, always trying to do the right thing, but still a woman who needs some protection.  I never knew Tomoe well enough to believe that Kenshin would have fallen in love with her.
Kenshin fans should appreciate this movie.  The animation is slightly different, better in fact, and there is none of the sometimes over the top silliness of the series- although much of what makes Kenshin lovable in the series is his goofiness.  The movie is worth getting if for no other reason than to learn about Kenshin's past.
For those who don't know Kenshin, I would probably not recommend this DVD.  You won't appreciate Kenshin without knowing his TV series personality, as his personality in the movie is a little flat and humorless, and quite a bit more serious.  I would suggest watching the first few episodes of the Kenshin series- you can buy the English dubbed versions in sets of three episodes.  I can almost guarantee you will be hooked if you do.
Finally, I would recommend this DVD set over buying the movies separately.  Although my DVD didn't seem to come with any of the promised extras except previews, I liked watching the two movies as one long movie with only a second-long black screen in between them.  The DVD set could easily have been made as one movie to begin with, and probably would have in this country, as a one hour movie is unheard of in the U.S..  As an aside, the preview of Samurai X, Reflection, is compelling enough to watch over and over before you actually view the last movie of the OAV.  In fact, my kid made me play it four times in a row.
I would have given this five stars, except for the problem of the lack of development of the relationship of Kenshin and Tomoe, and the fact that I don't think non-Kenshinites will be able to relate to it.",1073520000,3,4408,4.564005069708492
1845811,5,B00008G8PP,Samurai X is one of the best movies I've seen. It is very violent but it is great! the action scenes are amazing and the story is wonderful. if u liked the series (rurouni kenshin) then u will also love this movie too. ~~but i'd reccomend seeing this movie before u watch the series~~,1073174400,,284,4.277777777777778
1845812,5,B00008G8PP,"""Samurai X - Trust and Betrayal (Director's Cut)"" is probably the best chambara anime that I have seen.  Excellent story, top-notch animation, pathos and melodrama, over-the-top sword fighting...everything you want from sword-fight flicks.  There is a big difference between good chambara and bad chambara, and there is far more bad chambara than good.  This DVD is an overwhelmingly pleasant surprise.
Medieval Japan is on good display here, with an nice blend between fact and fantasy.  Not exactly Kurosawa, and not exactly ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" the warriors perform some pretty amazing feats befitting the super samurai that they are. The blood is fairly fountain-like, but not silly.
This is my only experience with ""Rurouni Kenshin,"" and to tell the truth, a friend had to force this DVD on me as I didn't want to see anything with the stupid name of ""Samurai X.""  I am glad that I gave it a chance.",1073174400,13,917,5.006578947368421
1845813,5,B00008G8PP,"This Movie is simply amazing. While it may be terribly violent and does hold some pretenses, that simply adds to the drama. I will be brutally honest, the fight scenes are bloody, and extremely violent. The way I see it though, it just adds to the idea of how he is this amazing assasin, who doesn't want to be. The character development is beyond good, the music is timed ever so perfectly, and the animation is top notch. The story is beyond amazing, I've seen the entire series and even the SX:Reflection DVD before this, but after seeing all of it(and the movie) I can say that this is probably the best of it all. Personally I like the character conflict with Tomoe and Kenshin, its pretty depressing/uplifting/shocking. The Development is pretty amazing, this is probably the best thing I've ever seen.
  I don't know about seeing the series first, it definently doubles and even triples the effect of the movie. I don't know if you should see it first, but I certainly suggest it, the series has a lot more humor than the OVA's(which barely have any) and the sword fights get less realistic to a degree, but its worth it. Its definently worth it to last through the series before seeing this. On a 1-10 scale, I rate this movie at 100. Its simply unrateable, and is a must but must be watched at a certain time and be ready. At the end of the movie you feel like a diferent person, almost as if you were in his position. Its a little depressing, but if you think about it it also shows a lot of hope and possibilities. I think you should be prepared for an emotional trip though, it definently will yank at you a good amount.",1072569600,,1632,4.4186046511627906
1845834,5,B00008G8PP,"This is the first taste of Rurouni Kenshin I ever experienced, and, to tell the truth, nothing save the original manga (and possibly the Shadow of the Wolf DVD) have been able to match my awe and appreciation for this masterpiece.
Samurai X (and that is the ONLY time I'm going to call it that) Trust and Betrayal combines the four Kenshin OVA's into a two-hour movie that tells the story of how a small boy became the legendary Hitokiri Battousai, how it nearly destroyed him from within, and how he was saved by the woman he loved, even though he could not save her.
This is a truly great anime, and is taken nearly word for word (and drawing for drawing) from Volume 19 of the RK manga, telling the story of how Shinta became Kenshin, trained under Seijuro Hiko in the arts of Hiten Mitsurugi-ryu, and lent his sword to the patriots during the time of the Bakumatsu. Here, the character interaction and development is handled with the same grace and beauty as the deadly sword combat, some of which is simply astonishingly good. And that's not to mention the superb animation work, which is probably the best in the series' history.
Overall, not only is this DVD a great deal (it costs half as much as buying Trust and Betrayal seperately) but it is also deserving of a permanent place in your DVD collection. Even if you are not usually a fan of anime, this is well worth the money and time. If you miss out on it, you miss out on pure animation magic.",1070064000,4,1456,4.436567164179104
1845835,5,B00008G8PP,"Samurai X is a prequel (in time) to the tv anime Rurouni Kenshin. It is set smack in the middle of the Meiji Revolution, a powerful time period for storytelling. Our hero is Kenshin Himura, an orphaned boy who is taught the secrets of Hiten-Mitsurugi swordsmanship. As the Meiji revolution engrosses more and more of Japan, Kenshin leaves his master to fight for the innocent people the revolution victimizes. His master scoffs at him and tells him if he does this thing he will become a murderer. The rest of the film follows Kenshins role in the Patriot army and his destined showdown with the family of one of his victims. This is truly epic storytelling, and the language, animation and tone rival anything American animation can produce. Just be warned, if you like this movie you will likely get hooked on Rurouni Kenshin as well, which is not a bad thing. Samurai X has a lot of bloody battles and killers, a love story, and a good deal of actual historical characters... all making it a remarkable work.",1069632000,2,1011,4.653631284916201
1845836,5,B00008G8PP,"I ordered this dvd a week or 2 ago and let me tell you it is the best! The action is quite spectacular and the visuals are stunning. Any anime fan should get or at least see it, even though i'm just an ordinary anime kind of guy! It is suggested 17+ but hey, im 11 and I enjoyed this as much as any person would, Its got blood and alcohol, Dang! They really should stop talking about saki, they're obsessed with it!^_^
It is about a boy named (no spoilers here) or Kenshin to some of us whose caretakers get killed. He gets saved by a master of the art of sword known as hiten-mitsurugi.
Its whole visual style is superb. And as everyone says ""they mix real life into it that makes it kind of silly"" well, they do but it doesnt ruin the movie. This tells you everything you should know before the rurouni kenshin tv series. It has got hell alot of kick @$$ action. Of course youd think its all action its not, there is a HUGE chunk thats all romance but all of this plus a great story make this numba 1 in my world!
P.S. this is my first review. Tell me if ya liked it!",1067817600,16,1069,4.023474178403756
1845837,5,B00008G8PP,"Being a huge fan of the original manga and TV series, it was a great joy to hear of the prequel OVA (original video animation).
From the moment Himura Shinta witnessed the killings of his companions to Himura Kenshin's longing gaze as he left the Chosu clan, there was not a single moment during this OVA that did not move me with awe, sadness, sympathy, fear, anger, hate, and any other emotion you might've felt.
In the true tradition of Japanese Kabuki tragedy, Rurouni Kenshin - Tsuiokuhen embodies everything that a romantic tale from the Meiji Era should have. From the extremely subtle yet meaningful love story of Kenshin and Tomoe, to the brief yet bloody sword battles of the Shinsen Gumi and Chosu factions, this OVA is filled with breathtaking attention to detail.
Animation is perhaps the least perfect element of this OVA. The reason for this is the use of live footage for the few water sequences. Somehow the image of real water set crashing against an animated beach doesn't go down well for me, Fortunately, this is very very few in numbers and doesn't affect the overall rating of the OVA. From the animation of the sword battles to the character designs of Tomoe and Kenshin, every single line and movements were drawn to draw out various emotions from the audience. That said, the use of muted colour perfectly convey the atmosphere most appropriate for this melancholic drama.
This OVA simply has one of the best soundtracks ever! Not just for anime, but in the film world in general. Taku Iwasaki's use of string and flute absolutely spot on for the mood needed to reinforce the images on screen. The quality is so good that i was often confused as to whether is was synth or orchestrated. In my opinion, this rates just as highly, if not better, with anime soundtracks of Macross Plus, Cowboy Bebop, Saishuu-Heiki Kanojo, and Rahxephon.
Perhaps the strongest, but also potentialy weakest, element of the OVA is the story. They managed to start and conclude, beautifully i might add, the love story of Kenshin and Tomoe, which, in hindsight, was perhaps the main theme of the OVA. There was never any danger of the story left unfinished. The background to which the love story is set, was the Meiji restoration of the mid-19th century. The producers also combined seamlessly the historical epic story with the love story, and still manage to include real life characters such as Katsura Kogoro, his teacher Kido Koin, and Shinsen Gumi members such as Okita without any awkwardness. In fact it only added to the epic feel that we are experiencing history in its making.
Some people confuse the story as simply that of how Kenshin got his scar, an element which was also well done. The scar was not simply character design nor a cosmetic convenience. A point well worth reminding to watchers of the TV series. Never could one imagine how to make such simple injuries to something more. Yet the makers of this OVA managed to make it into Kenshin's destiny, a reminder of his tragic past.
As i said before, the story have one potential weakness, that the background story of Meiji Restoration requires a somewhat significant understanding of 19th century Japanese history. Otherwise newcomers to the Kenshin saga might be lost as to the relationships of the various clans and characters and what their allegiances are to both the Tokugawa Shogun and Emperor Meiji. Nevertheless, this OVA is a prequel, and therefore the producers are assuming that you've seen the TV series. Taking this into account the only conclusion must be that the story element is, yet again, flawless.
The characters are the most important element to an anime, along with story, in my opinion. Unless, of course, it is intended to be short stories, as in the case of Full Metal Panic Fumoffu.
The character of Kenshin may not be the most sophisticated nor original character ever written, however, his character development is perfect when you combine it with that of Tomoe's. The way the characters interact with each other is simply understated, yet perfect. People may not like how Saito Hajime and Okita, as well as Hiko Seijuro are not as developed as can be. However, their characters are already given much more room to develop within the TV series.
With so many potential points that may have affected the review of this OVA, we must never forget one fact that this is a prequel. One must watch the TV series if they are to enjoy it to the maximum. Points such as lack of character development for the side characters and the confusing background story will only be felt by those that have never watched the TV series.
The value of this OVA lies in not only its collectable value, but also in the opportunity of watching a classic epic love tragedy. This is an anime truly worth the tag of a tragic love story. And it is eminently watchable. Anyway, you can always impress those anime-sceptics with this breathtaking OVA.
To me, the word flawless is a very hard word to give out easily, seeing as it encompasses a plane of existence that is inhabited by the very few. Rurouni Kenshin - Tsuiokuhen is as flawless as an anime can ever hope or aspire to be.",1066780800,3,5155,4.741648106904232

Needless to say it is absolutely necessary for one to watch this movie to understand the profound impact of a certain event in Kenshin's past which triggers in him a vow to never kill again.
Trust and Betrayal is dark, full of gore, yet it is beautiful at the same time.

1845839,2,B00008G8PP,"First, the two stars are for this directors cut DVD, NOT the series. I absolutely LOVE this series.
I decided to buy this DVD because I fell in love with the divx bootleg versions of the OAV, which were fan subbed. I can literally watch the divx versions over, and over again. I expected the DVD to be at least as good as the divx version, plus more because it was a directors cut and it would be DVD quality. I was wrong.
The amount added to this directors cut DVD isn't even noticeable. The main difference is that the episodes are all spliced into a continuous movie. The MOST disappointing part of this DVD was that they CHANGED the sound track. They TOOK OUT the background music in some of my favorite scenes. I was shocked. Why the hell did they do this? The animation and the background music were absolutely perfect together. It seemed like reactions and emotions of the characters were timed to fit with the music. The music added a lot of drama and made the scenes very memorable. But in this directors cut the music is missing. No words can express how disappointed I was.
I guess I should point out that I don't even watch anime with dubbed voices anymore. From my experience, American voice actors suck. I wasn't even able to watch 5 minutes of this DVD with dubbed voices without getting sick.
My second disappointment was with the English subtitles. I do not speak Japanese fluently (yet), but from what I know, I was able to see that the English translations were not very accurate in many parts of this DVD. Although the English in the fan sub wasn't perfect (broken grammar, misspelled words, etc), I felt the translations were more true to the series and Japanese culture in general.
Third disappointment was that when inserting the DVD I was greeted with a very obnoxious advertisement for some stupid anime magazine. When are these stupid companies going to realize that I don't pay $25 for a freaking DVD to see god damn advertisements?

This is the last non-imported Anime DVD I will buy in a LONG time. The Rurouni Kenshin OAV is my favorite Anime series of all time, and I hate this DVD.
If there were an American company that sold Anime DVDs that WERE NOT dubbed, had ACCURATE English subtitles, and didn't put advertisements on the discs, they would get 100% of my business. Until that day comes, I will continue to buy imports.
If you're going to buy either the directors cut or Trust and Betrayal separately, I would buy them separately, solely for (what I assume to be) the unchanged musical sound track. But, this is just my opinion, I don't actually have the separate DVD's.",1066262400,10,2607,4.57051282051282

I read the other reviews and some of them say their are buckets of blood now their is alot of blood but I wouldnt say buckets the first half trust does have some blood but thats just me, the second half is filled with romance, and if you are maddly in love with kenshin then you may not like the way this movie ends. the combo with real life photoes and cartooning is rather funny to watch, their is not much of it so it won't ruin the movie. for rurouni kenshin fans I highley recomend this movie, but for begginers you may want to wait. this movie is amazing and by far the best ova of ruroni kenshin ever.it will explain how he got his cross shapped scar, and why he decided to put away his sword and never kill again.the movie goes into high detail, and will keep you guessing until the end. and if you get sick or throgh up easly then I don't recomend it. the movie is in english and I think they matched the voices exeptionly well. their are a few swear words but I only noticed 1. it can be confusing but its worth watcing more than once. if I would rate this movie I would say about around the age of 15 even though audiences below (13)should be able to withstain the violence, after all its just a cartoon.hope my review helped.",1065484800,,1586,4.169381107491857
1845842,4,B00008G8PP,"Four years ago in 1999, I saw a bootlegged, fan-subtitled copy of Rurouni Kenshin OAV (direct to video) and was completely amazed. This became the standard that I judged other animated features by in years to come. All the other reviewers will agree that this is an excellent animated feature bleeding (literally) with high production values and quality animation. The questionable computer/live work and a few freeze frame shortcut animation sequences are my only, negligable gripes.
What's best about the plot is that there really is no good guy or bad guy, no cops or robbers, no cowboys and indians.  An ambiguous sense of good and evil that is very human leaves the viewers to make their own conclusions. This is art. It encourages thought and interaction. ""Cops and robbers"" is propaganda, which tells you what to think, that the cops are always the goodguys and they always have to win (Hollywood movies).
The ""director's cut,"" so to speak, must be the 1 inch CUT at the top and bottom of the screen (letterboxing). There are about 10 seconds of extra footage, with the music switched and even removed in some portions. Overall, I liked trust/betrayal better, but buy this DVD as a package/cheaper deal. It combines 2 dvd's in 1 and edits them together to run continuously for it's 4 segments. As you have been told from other reviews, don't buy if you already have trust/betrayal.
And as always, watch with original language dialogue (Japanese)and subtitles. Horrific English dubbing ruins even the best of movies, like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.",1064188800,4,1559,4.973180076628353

Kenshin Himura, the Battousai, is an assassin working for the Imperialists who want to create a new Era, one where all people are equal.  While trying to acheive his goal, however, he himself finds it more and more difficult each time to continue killing.

Unfortunately, for some reason the creators of this DvD have made it impossible to play on my Computer's DVD player.  It will work fine with my regular DVD player, just not with the PC's, which is really annoying.  In case you're wondering, my PC will play other anime DVDs just fine, so I have to think it is just this particular anime company.
  Okay, that said, I think this story of Kenshin's beginnings is really cool and awesome.  Perhaps one of the most artistic sword fight scenes I have ever seen in anime is in this story line.  Plus, the music is great and matches the moods shown in the story and even enhances them.  These two factors alone would justify buying this DVD.  Then add the extra scenes at the end and the fact that all the OVA episodes are on one disc and you are in anime heaven.
  Now having sung this DVD's praises and drawbacks, I should warn you that if you already own the earlier version of this Kenshin OAVs, then I do not think it is worth spending $$ for this version alone.  My recommendation, spend the $$ on another anime or other DVD.  Cheers.",1055462400,2,1162,4.299539170506913
1845882,3,B00008G8PP,"This is an abrupt departure from the series, and was my first encounter with the OVA's, so it was hard for me to adjust to the style.  You have to see it for the backstory (which the series never got a chance to cover before it was cancelled), which is superb.  But I had to rate it down for a few reasons:
--They don't use the same english voice cast...and the new cast is COMPLETELY passionless.  Maybe it plays better in japanese, where I think at least some cast is the same as the series (but I'm sorry, I can never get used to hearing Kenshin with a woman's voice).
--They cut some corners with computer animation (everyone remember how bad the last episode of the series looked?)...it's a pity, because lots of it has a beautiful theatrical quality, but when they throw in some of the computer stuff, it's glaringly obvious and distracting.
--I never saw the original releases of TRUST and BETRAYAL, with the separate episodes, but when edited altogether like this, the combination of the passionless voice acting and the subtle story make it a little too long and dull to really enjoy.  The beginning with the graphic (but wonderful) bloodshed, and the ending tragedy are the great movers of the movie.
If you are a fan of the series (particularly the dubbed version), I'd rent this before buying.  You have to see it for the story, but that way you can decide if the OVA style is for you.",1055203200,,1397,4.5059288537549405

I've read some complaints about the voices not being the same as the show, and the art work being different, but the art work is great and more realistic in my opinion. The voice overs are different, but a good fit and not a show stopper.",1483660800,,385,4.078947368421052

Couldn't. Put. It. Down.  This movie did NOT have the same effect.  The artwork seemed bland.  There is so much more detail in the original drawings.  Most importantly, it is not true to the story.  It changes the relationship between Tomoe and Kenshin, and not for the better, in my opinion.  It changes how they met.  It cuts out some of the growing trust that happened in Kyoto.  It changes their state of marriage.  And it changes Kenshin's complete state of mind when he goes to find Tomoe and battles in the forest.  I wanted to see the manga come to life.  This is not it.  Perhaps, if you've never read the manga by Watsuki, you will enjoy it much more than I.  But me, the collector that I am, I think I will probably not keep this DVD.",1447891200,,921,4.329411764705882

7983501,5,B00008G8PP,"The experience I have with Ruroni Kenshin is something that begins with when I grew up watching it on Cartoon Network. It doesn't end here, but it only begins anew; I watched Samurai X last summer and the movie is byfar the defining moment in all of Ruroni Kenshin, alongside the Kyoto Arc.

Himura Kenshin is constructed as the murderous Hitokiri Battousai (With perfect Richard Hayworth-referencing dubbing, by the way) and in the same breath deconstructed to a perfect form. An almighty samurai is what we're given between both ends of the spectrum, someone who lives and breathes the quest for redemption that so eludes a killer. The means by which the visuals are crafted in this movie fuses some off-kilter techniques, such as the use of 3D graphics at certain moments of the movie. These can come off imperfectly for some people, but their best manifestations can capture the emotion that seems to round out the entire atmosphere of the saga we have before us.

In closing, Ruroni Kenshin is the most muted Kenshin we've ever seen, someone who has an emotional breadth that is as tragic as it is alluring. The amorous subplot of Kenshin and Tomoe is something gorgeous in its stare and an undertaking that the series unfortunately missed; a point of contention for a lot of people is that the series' final season was entirely a filler arc and Reflection was made as a poor consummation that did not round out the canon. As such, we are only left to see a story that has yet to continue, but begins so perfectly. Enjoy.",1407715200,,1526,4.690298507462686
