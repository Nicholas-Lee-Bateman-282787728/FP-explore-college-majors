8154893,4,B000K7UESG,"I avoided this box initially due the cost it added to Volume 2, which was already an $18 purchase retail. However After getting the entire series it seemed only right to keep the 7 DVDs collected somehow. The box itself has the same wonderful artwork from the series and is made of a relatively sturdy cardboard. I wouldn't place too much weight on top of it, as that's not it's purpose, but it should hold up well enough on a bookshelf.",1327708800,,437,4.407407407407407

Includes Eps. 5-8",1189468800,,117,4.85
8154895,4,B000K7UESG,"The Chronos Tokyo story started at the beginning of this series concludes here. Those familiar with the original Anime series will find quite a few similarities to the new one (understandable seeing as they came from the same source) with the difference that this series makes it far more clear that the story isn't quite over yet.

I like the increased plot for Guyver II enough to make me wish they could have done more with his character.

Overall if you love violent action anime, this will definitely satisfy you",1172534400,,517,4.733333333333333
8154896,4,B000K7UESG,"this is going to be brill, the disc was exellent and the presentation box was a delight to behold. looking forward to collecting the rest of the volumes. thoroughly enjoyable dvd, loved guyver the first time round, this revised story and new art work are excellent.",1169769600,,265,4.782608695652174
8154897,5,B000K7UESG,"What can I say. I love it. I have always been a huge fan of the Guyver and how can you not? I know some people had said some stuff about Vol 1. Well vol 2 it gets better. I personaly loved Vol 1 I have seen all the eps so I know everythng but not in english.

If you thought Vol 1 is ok then get Vol 2 with the box. It's amazing i love it. Vol 2 will leaing you hanging and wanting more Guyver. Sadly you will have to wait another 2 months until Vol 3 comes out but it will be worth the wait.

If your the fan of the Guyver then you should know you need to buy this along with vol 1 if you have not done so already. If you are looking for a new anime to get into. I say hurry up and buy Vol 2 with the box while you can and get Vol 1. This is an amazing anime series that has been around for a long time and hopefully will continue for a very long time.",1168128000,,853,3.556149732620321
8154898,5,B000K7UESG,"With this volume, you also get a special box that will eventually fit all seven volumes once they are all released. The box art is really beautiful and looks great next to the other DVDs. The episodes themselves are really great and real a lot more in the story. We finally see Guyver 3 and Enzyme. The story is more detailed than it was in the original anime series and looks really beautiful. If you really enjoyed the first volume, it only gets better with the second. All Guyver fans need this series because it is just simply amazing. I also recommend getting it with this box, it is great!",1167868800,4,595,4.418181818181818
