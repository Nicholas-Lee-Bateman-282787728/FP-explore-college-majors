7799478,5,1586134035,"This is the most effective and powerful qigong anywhere in the world. I have tried over 20 different chi kung forms over the years and almost all of them have been first tested by my medical clairvoyant. Doing this Falun Gong automatically installs a Falun wheel which generates chi 24/7. There is only one other chi kung method that does this, Wu Wei Qigong. But Wu Wei Qigong uses the same movements as Falun, so not sure who copied who. I felt the wheel being installed in my lower dan tien a day after I learned the method 4 or 5 years ago. The only reason I dropped it after 3 months was because you have to have over an hour to do it. We Wei Qigong does not take this long. I would recommend that you also buy the book in order to see still photos of each movement and the written instructions. This is the highest level of chi kung in the world.
