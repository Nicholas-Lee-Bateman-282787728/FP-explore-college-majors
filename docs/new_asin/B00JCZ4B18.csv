8649791,4,B00JCZ4B18,"Sequel is as good as the first one-Ishqiya. The new story and characters blend in with the two old grifters played by Naseerudin Shah and Arshad Warsi. Old mansion, the Begum played by Madhuri Dixit provide a nostalgic look at an era that is now history. The music and atmosphere feel very authentic. The new comer Begum friend and companion is beautiful and a good actress. Overall another classy movie from Vishal Bhardwaj.",1405468800,,425,4.835616438356165
