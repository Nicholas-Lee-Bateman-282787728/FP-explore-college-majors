2988174,5,B000WOSAYC,THE NOVIE WAS VERY GOOD I WAS SURPRISED!! IT WAS LIKE A MIXTURE OF MEAN GIRLS/CHEETAH GIRLS/HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL!!! VERY ENTERTAINING FOR ALL GIRLS ANY AGES!!! I LOVED IT AND IM ALMOST 21 LOL!!!!,1201564800,,194,4.735294117647059
2988175,5,B000WOSAYC,At fist I thought this movie might be a little cheesy but after watching it I was quit surprised.  I bought this movie for my daughter for Christmas. It really teaches the true value of frienship.  I would consider it for any young daughter who play with Bratz.,1200960000,,261,4.416666666666667
2988176,1,B000WOSAYC,"I was reading some of the reviews about this movie and even checked wikipedia for info.  What I found was a mixture of reviews that never talked about the movie but about other reviews, so I'm going to focus on the movie a little more.  I rented this movie so me and my friends could make fun of it but there was little to make fun of it was just bad.  This movie really couldn't get any worse.  Apparently the people making the film were very inconsistent because several scenes that were spliced together had the actresses switching places or wearing different or less clothing/jewelry.  I was amazed that this movie has even been compared to HSM because all Bratz tries to do is copy HSM, which it did a horrible job of.  Maybe little kids would like this movie because they don't care about the inconsistencies, but let's face it.  Little kids aren't dumb and if they don't mention some of these things, it's not for lack of noticing.",1200960000,4,938,4.482352941176471
2988177,5,B000WOSAYC,Kids loved the movie in the theater so now they can watch it over and over! Nice movie for kids. Teaches good friendship values and team work.,1199145600,,142,4.296296296296297
2988178,5,B000WOSAYC,"I did not want to watch this movie, and I tried to get out of renting it for my daughter after I read all the reviews.  But I gave in and watched it.  And what followed really surprised me.  I am giving this movie a 5 star rating not because it is a 5 star movie - it is not, maybe just 3 stars.  I am rating this movie 5 stars because I believe that this movie was intentionally trashed by Disney as (with the exception of the songs and singing)it is better and covers exactly the same themes as High School Musical.  And I enjoyed it a lot more than High School Musical.  It is pretty obvious from the reviews that very few of the critics actually watched this movie - they just towed the line, and trashed it.  It really is not bad at all.  It does not promote commercialism or consumerism, or your daughters being ****** as all the reviews say, not at all.  So if your daughter wants to watch this - let her - she will get a positive message from it and you might be surprised how much you enjoy it.  And as for Disney, it is a shame that they feel the need to squash a movie like this to protect the HSM franchise.  But then Barbie did not see Bratz coming, and they certainly hit Barbie hard, so maybe Disney has their reasons.  But don't be bullied by Disney - watch this and enjoy!!",1197158400,3,1290,4.075396825396825
2988179,3,B000WOSAYC,"There is a pressure on filmmakers when it comes to turning an extremely lucrative toy franchise into a feature film. Sometimes filmmakers have it easy, especially when the topic is giant fighting robots that already have a mythos attached. Other times the demands are too much, case in point Batman and Robin, a film in which Joel Schumacher admits that the merchandising seemingly drove the entire narrative. One has to give director Sean McNamara credit for finding the story in Bratz, the new feature film based off a line of sexually suggestive, ghetto Barbie dolls.

While most adults will likely approach Bratz as nothing more than mind rotting fluff, McNamara manages to tackle some deeply entrenched high school quandaries, namely cliques and their destructive nature on friendships. Moving from their computer animated, straight to video releases to a live action, big screen adventure, The Bratz are tackling their biggest challenge yet: the angst ridden days of high school.

Controlled by the long arm of the Principal's spoiled daughter, Meredith, the queen bee is determined to maintain her powerful status by keeping the school populace segregated into cliques. At first the ""Best Friends Forever"" fights Meredith's stronghold, but as each member of the Bratz posse discovers their own unique talents, they are quickly pulled into separate factions. Before it's too late though, a fateful mistake by Meredith reunites the girls, joining them together to take down the student body president's tyrannical rule.

Reminiscent of many late eighties' films aimed at children, Bratz is epic in scale, spanning three years of the girls' high school careers, but underneath all the shopping, singing and dancing there are actually powerful messages. While materialism is obviously enforced by the overt product placement and fashion featured in the film, the fact that McNamara is able to clearly portray cliques in a negative light might be a hugely positive theme to expose ten-year-old girls to.

Not any more mind numbing or offensive than an overlong episode of Saved By the Bell set in the modern MTV generation, the influence of Bratz will not truly be understood for another decade, when the target audience grows up and reflects on the product with a sense of nostalgia. For adult audiences to write off the film as aggravatingly awful is not truly fair. Can you imagine being denied your favorite childhood movies, simply because the critics thought they were mindless entertainment?

While Bratz may be a torturous two hours for adults, the positive message and frantic pace and style of McNamara's film will certainly entertain, and hopefully influence its target audience.

Special Features:

With box-office prices at such a high level, Lionsgate should find that Bratz will perform much better at home, where the purchase or rental of the DVD will ease the strain on parents' wallets. Filled with features that promise to entertain audiences of all ages, the Bratz DVD will undoubtedly be a hot seller thanks to its strategically planned release right before the holidays.

While the deleted scenes and music videos should give young girls the extra Bratz fix they need, the biggest surprises on the disc are the 12 featurettes! While most films targeted at children rarely offer any substantial material, behind the scenes looks at casting, wardrobe and some of the picture's huge set pieces are a refreshing addition. McNamara's commentary is also engaging, offering great insight and personal reflection on how he approached turning Bratz into a live-action production.

Overall:

Regardless of how the doll's attitude and fashion statements have influenced children up to this point, McNamara has created a piece of cinematic fluff that will inevitably do more good than harm.

2988180,4,B000WOSAYC,"This is a nice clean movie with a good message, for preteens or young teens. It's got some great food fight scenes, and a nicely snotty anti-heroine. But my favorite is the girl in the background of the food fight who is making such a disgusting face, and the one who makes the spectacular kick in the soccer game, and the stiltwalker at the party!",1195689600,,348,4.369230769230769

It was not as flimsy as I thought it would be and it had the Bratz in real-life situations and with interesting personalities. If you love the Bratz, I would say get this. It isn't overrated. It sisn't show any cleavage and it was enjoyable for all audiences. I can't think of a movie that would do better. This was definitely better than the Spongebob movie I wasted my money on!",1189987200,9,546,4.362745098039215

2988222,5,B000WOSAYC,"Gotta admit, as a college guy today, this movie brings back a lot of good memories. I first saw this movie as a class back in 6th grade.

It's understandable that the movie doesn't have ""the best"" reviews from everyone, however that's quite obvious because it wasn't meant for people of all ages. It was specifically targeted for pre-teens. Therefore, we shouldn't be surprised that other age groups (e.g. adults) are giving the movie negative reviews.. It simply wasn't made for them.

The movie also delivers some important messages every pre-teen should understand before heading into high school (e.g. friendship is very important, how to stand up for yourself, etc.). Plus most pre-teens would enjoy this movie as many are obviously excited to head into high school and the movie gives somewhat of an insight on what high school is kind of like. And let's face it, it's nearly impossible for a movie to give a perfect insight of what high school is exactly like.

So generally speaking, anyone from grades 6-8 should enjoy the movie a lot, despite its negative reviews.",1455408000,,1074,4.8901098901098905

I'm not a big fan of the ""tough"" look of the Bratz dolls, but I gave in. I am very glad that I did. We all enjoyed the movie, which is light family fare with somewhat predictable characters competing for big success in the oh-so-fashionable world of high school. The villain is the daughter of the school principal, and is delightfully hilarious in her eventual defeat. The music is actually pretty good, and everyone enjoyed watching. If you are looking for a good flick with some good values presented, you won't go worng with Bratz!",1325894400,4,639,4.614035087719298

2988285,5,B000WOSAYC,"When I first heard of this movie I mentally checked it off as a piece of ridiculous fluff. How could the smexy, sultry, trashy, obsessed-with-bling plastic dolls who have long been rivals of Barbie produce anything worth watching? But after reading a review on Plugged In Online, I decided to give the Bratz a shot. And now I'm so glad I did!
While much of the movie is cotton candy, there's some meat to it as well. Wonderful lessons are taught--such as standing up for yourself without trashing your opressor, forgivness, friendship, selflessness, willing to do what's hard for a good cause, respect for your elders...I could go on. Unlike in so many teen movies and tween sitcoms you find on Disney or Nickelodeon, the girls all have great respect for their parents and have loving relationships with them. Cloe tells a room full of people that her mom, who selflessly and tirelessly works to provide for her daughter, is her hero. The teachers at school are not shown as clueless--apart from the principal, who is Meredith's father...but he also cares for his children and tries to encourage them. Cherish, Meredith's sister, says to him ""You're a good Dad."" A boy defends Jade's honor when another makes a rude comment. The main characters make mistakes and admit them, then apologize. The things that usually embarrass teenagers and tweens (being driven in Mom's car, being a 'nerd', making your own clothes, working and going against the flow) are embraced and glorified. A particularly memorable moment is when, amid the backlight and fog and dramatic music, the girls pull up to an event and step out in slow motion--from Cloe's mom's minivan. Absolutely pricless.
The language amounts to about 5-6 usages of God's name, but no more. A few times characters expose a little belly, and there's a few short skirts, (Meredith wears the most revealing out of all the characters) but the clothing is mostly very layered and modest--vastly different from the doll counterparts. Fashion and shopping and beauty are emphasized a little too heavily, but it's all fun, not trying to look sexy. Jade lies to her parents, but she later apologizes. Aggresive shopping is shown in a good light (do we really want to be jerking belts from other people's hands and playing tug-of-war until one person goes flying?). There is a lot of stereotyping, but even that is shown in a bad light. The mantra of the film encourages people to be themselves, hang out with who they want, and do what they are interested in, even if it contradicts the cliques and expectations. The Bratz girls are over-exuberant and a little too ditzy at times, but they act exactly the way most teenage girls act.
The disc itself is a good buy--with so much extra material, you'd think you were getting a bonus disc. There are several featurettes, behind-the-scenes, commentaries, meet-the-actresses and music videos to add a little more spice to the sugar.

Overall, this was an extremely enjoyable movie that I want to watch again and again despite myself. While there are a few mild concerns and eyeroll-inducing moments, it's a wonderful movie with bright, bubbly colors and good lessons to be learned.",1311033600,4,3169,4.901303538175046

2988289,3,B000WOSAYC,"3 of 5 stars for the teen comedy movie Bratz. Hollywood loves to remake a theme when it is successful, this movie is a remake of Mean Girls with more comedy and less ""social study"". Same basic themes. Take four high school girls each is skilled in a differnt subject. The school has its clicks of people (Nerds, Goths, Jocks, etc.). Our girls find it easy to fit into their clicks based on their skills (the smart girl fits with the nerds in the science club, etc). The problem is these clicks cause our BFF (Best Friend Forever) girls to drift apart. So our girls work to tear down the clicks and bring harmony. All is good until the spoiled-rich-girl decides she prefers the clicks to remain.

A funny and cute movie which is pretty well made. The story is more geared towards comedy than looking at the social fabric of high school students. Yes, I recommend this movie, however, if you only have time for one movie, Mean Girls is a bit better.",1261180800,,947,4.442528735632184

It is a story based off the freak dolls who live in a perfect world.  The movie trailer literally tells you how it ends.  You know they defeat the popular girl and they win the guy.  You have to be an idiot to not know how it ends.  The movie was highly unrealistic, I mean what school is ruled by cliques, and what girl has an elephant at a party?  The movie is very stupid, predictable, and the cast is basically composed of unknown stars who probably are doing nothing now.  What genius thought that it would be cool to make a movie off the stupid doll company which portrays a anorexic, skanky version of what a girl should look like.

Although the Bratz are a wonderful product line, the
movie wasn't. The story line itself is okay, but how
the director presented it wasn't all that great. The 2
songs at the end was a terrible way to close the movie.
Meredth's song was all about her being so great, and the
Bratz was about their style and how everyone loves them. What kind of lesson is that? The Bratz came off just as shallow as the bad guy.
The one part when they won't see or hardly talk to eachother over 2 years
is also kind of pointless, because when they finally do see eachother
they don't know how to react to eachother, thus causing
Meredth to make them start the food fight, another pointless
part (except for the fact it makes the girls better friends
again later). It seemed like just an excuse to have a food fight.

 On a side note, the girls don't even act their
age, and do all sorts of ""little"" girl things, IN PUBLIC!
This is just my opinion, but I'm sure many people see what I mean. I was really looking forward to this movie. I was really disappointed.",1203379200,,1077,4.2439024390243905

I'm not saying that they (the screenwriters, etc) did not stereotype a lot, and that they concentrated too much on fashion and beauty, but instead of looking at those things look at the two things it does teach: we can all learn new things, and we can work as a team.
I don't like how they made fashion and beauty such a big thing, but let's face it: the world treats beautiful people nicer. It always has.",1201651200,3,433,4.2926829268292686

What I found was a mixture of reviews that never talked about the movie but about other reviews, so I'm going to focus on the movie a little more.  I rented this movie so me and my friends could make fun of it but there was little to make fun of it was just bad.  This movie really couldn't get any worse.  Apparently the people making the film were very inconsistent because several scenes that were spliced together had the actresses switching places or wearing different or less clothing/jewelry.  I was amazed that this movie has even been compared to HSM because all Bratz tries to do is copy HSM, which it did a horrible job of.  Maybe little kids would like this movie because they don't care about the inconsistencies, but let's face it.  Little kids aren't dumb and if they don't mention some of these things, it's not for lack of noticing.",1200960000,4,938,4.482352941176471

3222675,5,B000WOSAYC,"I did not want to watch this movie, and I tried to get out of renting it for my daughter after I read all the reviews.  But I gave in and watched it.  And what followed really surprised me.  I am giving this movie a 5 star rating not because it is a 5 star movie - it is not, maybe just 3 stars.  I am rating this movie 5 stars because I believe that this movie was intentionally trashed by Disney as (with the exception of the songs and singing)it is better and covers exactly the same themes as High School Musical.  And I enjoyed it a lot more than High School Musical.  It is pretty obvious from the reviews that very few of the critics actually watched this movie - they just towed the line, and trashed it.  It really is not bad at all.  It does not promote commercialism or consumerism, or your daughters being ****** as all the reviews say, not at all.  So if your daughter wants to watch this - let her - she will get a positive message from it and you might be surprised how much you enjoy it.  And as for Disney, it is a shame that they feel the need to squash a movie like this to protect the HSM franchise.  But then Barbie did not see Bratz coming, and they certainly hit Barbie hard, so maybe Disney has their reasons.  But don't be bullied by Disney - watch this and enjoy!!",1197158400,3,1290,4.075396825396825
3222676,3,B000WOSAYC,"There is a pressure on filmmakers when it comes to turning an extremely lucrative toy franchise into a feature film. Sometimes filmmakers have it easy, especially when the topic is giant fighting robots that already have a mythos attached. Other times the demands are too much, case in point Batman and Robin, a film in which Joel Schumacher admits that the merchandising seemingly drove the entire narrative. One has to give director Sean McNamara credit for finding the story in Bratz, the new feature film based off a line of sexually suggestive, ghetto Barbie dolls.

While most adults will likely approach Bratz as nothing more than mind rotting fluff, McNamara manages to tackle some deeply entrenched high school quandaries, namely cliques and their destructive nature on friendships. Moving from their computer animated, straight to video releases to a live action, big screen adventure, The Bratz are tackling their biggest challenge yet: the angst ridden days of high school.

Controlled by the long arm of the Principal's spoiled daughter, Meredith, the queen bee is determined to maintain her powerful status by keeping the school populace segregated into cliques. At first the ""Best Friends Forever"" fights Meredith's stronghold, but as each member of the Bratz posse discovers their own unique talents, they are quickly pulled into separate factions. Before it's too late though, a fateful mistake by Meredith reunites the girls, joining them together to take down the student body president's tyrannical rule.

Reminiscent of many late eighties' films aimed at children, Bratz is epic in scale, spanning three years of the girls' high school careers, but underneath all the shopping, singing and dancing there are actually powerful messages. While materialism is obviously enforced by the overt product placement and fashion featured in the film, the fact that McNamara is able to clearly portray cliques in a negative light might be a hugely positive theme to expose ten-year-old girls to.

Not any more mind numbing or offensive than an overlong episode of Saved By the Bell set in the modern MTV generation, the influence of Bratz will not truly be understood for another decade, when the target audience grows up and reflects on the product with a sense of nostalgia. For adult audiences to write off the film as aggravatingly awful is not truly fair. Can you imagine being denied your favorite childhood movies, simply because the critics thought they were mindless entertainment?

While Bratz may be a torturous two hours for adults, the positive message and frantic pace and style of McNamara's film will certainly entertain, and hopefully influence its target audience.

Special Features:

With box-office prices at such a high level, Lionsgate should find that Bratz will perform much better at home, where the purchase or rental of the DVD will ease the strain on parents' wallets. Filled with features that promise to entertain audiences of all ages, the Bratz DVD will undoubtedly be a hot seller thanks to its strategically planned release right before the holidays.

While the deleted scenes and music videos should give young girls the extra Bratz fix they need, the biggest surprises on the disc are the 12 featurettes! While most films targeted at children rarely offer any substantial material, behind the scenes looks at casting, wardrobe and some of the picture's huge set pieces are a refreshing addition. McNamara's commentary is also engaging, offering great insight and personal reflection on how he approached turning Bratz into a live-action production.

Overall:

Regardless of how the doll's attitude and fashion statements have influenced children up to this point, McNamara has created a piece of cinematic fluff that will inevitably do more good than harm.

3222719,5,B000WOSAYC,"Gotta admit, as a college guy today, this movie brings back a lot of good memories. I first saw this movie as a class back in 6th grade.

It's understandable that the movie doesn't have ""the best"" reviews from everyone, however that's quite obvious because it wasn't meant for people of all ages. It was specifically targeted for pre-teens. Therefore, we shouldn't be surprised that other age groups (e.g. adults) are giving the movie negative reviews.. It simply wasn't made for them.

The movie also delivers some important messages every pre-teen should understand before heading into high school (e.g. friendship is very important, how to stand up for yourself, etc.). Plus most pre-teens would enjoy this movie as many are obviously excited to head into high school and the movie gives somewhat of an insight on what high school is kind of like. And let's face it, it's nearly impossible for a movie to give a perfect insight of what high school is exactly like.

So generally speaking, anyone from grades 6-8 should enjoy the movie a lot, despite its negative reviews.",1455408000,,1074,4.8901098901098905

3222782,5,B000WOSAYC,"When I first heard of this movie I mentally checked it off as a piece of ridiculous fluff. How could the smexy, sultry, trashy, obsessed-with-bling plastic dolls who have long been rivals of Barbie produce anything worth watching? But after reading a review on Plugged In Online, I decided to give the Bratz a shot. And now I'm so glad I did!
While much of the movie is cotton candy, there's some meat to it as well. Wonderful lessons are taught--such as standing up for yourself without trashing your opressor, forgivness, friendship, selflessness, willing to do what's hard for a good cause, respect for your elders...I could go on. Unlike in so many teen movies and tween sitcoms you find on Disney or Nickelodeon, the girls all have great respect for their parents and have loving relationships with them. Cloe tells a room full of people that her mom, who selflessly and tirelessly works to provide for her daughter, is her hero. The teachers at school are not shown as clueless--apart from the principal, who is Meredith's father...but he also cares for his children and tries to encourage them. Cherish, Meredith's sister, says to him ""You're a good Dad."" A boy defends Jade's honor when another makes a rude comment. The main characters make mistakes and admit them, then apologize. The things that usually embarrass teenagers and tweens (being driven in Mom's car, being a 'nerd', making your own clothes, working and going against the flow) are embraced and glorified. A particularly memorable moment is when, amid the backlight and fog and dramatic music, the girls pull up to an event and step out in slow motion--from Cloe's mom's minivan. Absolutely pricless.
The language amounts to about 5-6 usages of God's name, but no more. A few times characters expose a little belly, and there's a few short skirts, (Meredith wears the most revealing out of all the characters) but the clothing is mostly very layered and modest--vastly different from the doll counterparts. Fashion and shopping and beauty are emphasized a little too heavily, but it's all fun, not trying to look sexy. Jade lies to her parents, but she later apologizes. Aggresive shopping is shown in a good light (do we really want to be jerking belts from other people's hands and playing tug-of-war until one person goes flying?). There is a lot of stereotyping, but even that is shown in a bad light. The mantra of the film encourages people to be themselves, hang out with who they want, and do what they are interested in, even if it contradicts the cliques and expectations. The Bratz girls are over-exuberant and a little too ditzy at times, but they act exactly the way most teenage girls act.
The disc itself is a good buy--with so much extra material, you'd think you were getting a bonus disc. There are several featurettes, behind-the-scenes, commentaries, meet-the-actresses and music videos to add a little more spice to the sugar.

Overall, this was an extremely enjoyable movie that I want to watch again and again despite myself. While there are a few mild concerns and eyeroll-inducing moments, it's a wonderful movie with bright, bubbly colors and good lessons to be learned.",1311033600,4,3169,4.901303538175046

3222786,3,B000WOSAYC,"3 of 5 stars for the teen comedy movie Bratz. Hollywood loves to remake a theme when it is successful, this movie is a remake of Mean Girls with more comedy and less ""social study"". Same basic themes. Take four high school girls each is skilled in a differnt subject. The school has its clicks of people (Nerds, Goths, Jocks, etc.). Our girls find it easy to fit into their clicks based on their skills (the smart girl fits with the nerds in the science club, etc). The problem is these clicks cause our BFF (Best Friend Forever) girls to drift apart. So our girls work to tear down the clicks and bring harmony. All is good until the spoiled-rich-girl decides she prefers the clicks to remain.

A funny and cute movie which is pretty well made. The story is more geared towards comedy than looking at the social fabric of high school students. Yes, I recommend this movie, however, if you only have time for one movie, Mean Girls is a bit better.",1261180800,,947,4.442528735632184

This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  Ever.  And I've seen the Pam Anderson/Tommy Lee sex tape.",1223251200,7,587,4.715686274509804

3222821,2,B000WOSAYC,"Written by my 12 year old and me:

Although the Bratz are a wonderful product line, the
movie wasn't. The story line itself is okay, but how
the director presented it wasn't all that great. The 2
songs at the end was a terrible way to close the movie.
Meredth's song was all about her being so great, and the
Bratz was about their style and how everyone loves them. What kind of lesson is that? The Bratz came off just as shallow as the bad guy.
The one part when they won't see or hardly talk to eachother over 2 years
is also kind of pointless, because when they finally do see eachother
they don't know how to react to eachother, thus causing
Meredth to make them start the food fight, another pointless
part (except for the fact it makes the girls better friends
again later). It seemed like just an excuse to have a food fight.

 On a side note, the girls don't even act their
age, and do all sorts of ""little"" girl things, IN PUBLIC!
This is just my opinion, but I'm sure many people see what I mean. I was really looking forward to this movie. I was really disappointed.",1203379200,,1077,4.2439024390243905
3222822,3,B000WOSAYC,"I really liked this movie. I'm not saying that they (the screenwriters, etc) did not stereotype a lot, and that they concentrated too much on fashion and beauty, but instead of looking at those things look at the two things it does teach: we can all learn new things, and we can work as a team.
I don't like how they made fashion and beauty such a big thing, but let's face it: the world treats beautiful people nicer. It always has.",1201651200,3,433,4.2926829268292686
