8021974,1,B0002475J8,"Amazon is advertising the US NTSC format version of working, but sent me (and at least one other person it seems, from reading these reviews) the PAL format DVD. Unplayable and useless in any Region 1 players. I am now waiting for a US replacement. I'll update when I get it and hope this time it's the right one.",1376352000,,313,4.322033898305085

8021978,5,B0002475J8,"This musical was shown on PBS many years ago.  It is still relevant in its reflection on work.  The pace is fast, and the music is delightful.  It is a celebration of work and also makes a bow to its challenges and difficulties.  Best of all, it moves one beyond just doing a job and made me think about ""the daily grind"" as somewhat hopeful and redemptive.",1325808000,,357,4.2835820895522385
8021979,3,B0002475J8,"The video is old and obscure - not the original Broadway cast, but an excellent one, just the same. A PBS TV version of the musical.",1264809600,2,132,4.115384615384615
