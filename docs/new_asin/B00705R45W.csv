5045970,5,B00705R45W,"I think this is a first class piece of work.

It is clearly shot in HD, easy to view, the examples are clear, logical and relevant, and will help those who pay attention to understand the why of what we do, and how to better serve the music.  While ostensibly a jazz drum set video, what it has to say about playing the music applies in a broader sense to any idiom.

In my view, this is a new benchmark for drum set instructional video.  Many  videos cover the mechanics of getting around the kit, or nuances of a given style; few treat, as deeply or meaningfully as this, what the music asks us to do.  It's really about using the instrument to make the music come alive.

Aside from being a world class musician who plays the heck out of the drums (and trumpet) Ralph is also a superb communicator and teacher.  This is a rare mix, in my experience.  His examples are consistently articulate, clear, Socratic, and often tinged with a bit of humor.

If you don't have the opportunity to study with him privately, this is a good start.  Warning: it may lead to pilgrimages to Boston, however, from which you will return smarter than  when you left, and more aware of how much more there is yet to do.",1327104000,2,1201,4.336322869955157
5045971,5,B00705R45W,"Ralph Peterson taking the time to explains things correctly?!?! This can't be true. Well, IT IS.  I'm a rock drummer for many years who is now studying jazz. This is an AMAZING resource! It's Ralph Peterson, one of the greatest jazz drummers of our time, providing a thorough and understandable method for working towards mastery. I bought it after seeing some clips of it on youtube and I freaked out. My experience with many drum videos has been that they lack a cohesive program. This is totally different. It's very well thought out and logically sequenced. Ralph provides a great understanding about playing from the mechanics to being able to play in context. Like the great drum books (Chapin, Reed, etc.) this video is the real deal. I'm looking forward to spending lots of time working through this.",1327104000,4,808,4.855072463768116

8507529,1,B00705R45W,"I bought this product based on other people's review. People were writing that this guy is not only a well known jazz drummer, but he really breaks down what he is doing. Well, first of all, he plays everything super fast, playing all these rudiments that I've never heard of, and there's not even any drum charts. Every free video on youtube give you a chart to look at. When he went on about drag paradiddle, I had to go to a free website which had the drum charts in order to understand what he was talking about. Overall, it taught me nothing about playing jazz drumming. I guess that I cannot return this product because I already opened it and watched it, but I don't think I'll ever watch it again. He says that studying rudiments are important, but then he doesn't ever really explain the rudiments. He just plays fast, and says, I hope you heard that rudiment I just played. He doesn't break anything down.

After this product I realized how meaningless positive reviews are since it's a known fact that some companies pays people to put fake reviews with 5 stars.",1400803200,3,1073,4.5025641025641026
8507530,5,B00705R45W,Mr. Peterson is a heel of a drummer and teacher.  He is tradition and he teaches with clarity and motivation.  One of the best Dvds on jazz that I have ever seen.  Great from minute one!,1392163200,,186,4.111111111111111

Ralph Peterson partilha neste DVD, a sua perspectiva e abordagem na arte de aprender a tocar este estilo, focando todos os pontos chave.
Numa era em que vivemos com o excesso de informao, este DVD  simplesmente inspirador e um guia de trabalho!",1343692800,,358,4.868852459016393
8507532,5,B00705R45W,"I purchased the first three available drum DVDs from Jazzheaven (Harland, Hoenig, Peterson). This is a niche market and these videos are really unique -- please support their work! Of the three, this video feels most like a one-on-one lesson, and while it obviously can't replace a teacher's observations, Peterson has done a wonderful job selecting and illuminating the material. Worth repeated viewings.",1343520000,2,405,5.444444444444445
8507533,5,B00705R45W,"I have always been disappointed with the lackluster content of jazz drumming DVDs that have ""creativity"" or ""musicality"" in their title. Seems lots of good players cannot adequately and clearly convey what they do or why they do it. Ralph Peterson is one of those rare individuals whose ability to concisely articulate the hows and whys of jazz drumming is equal to his fantastic playing. This DVD is so loaded with educated, experienced, and practical insights on general and specicic levels across the complete spectrum of this art, it may take several repeated viewings to really take home everything he has to convey. Most of the time watching a DVD feels like watching a DVD. Ralph Peterson's personality and communicative ability come across so well it almost feels like he's in the room with the viewer. He provides some important insight on the styles of many of the greats such as Art Blakey, Philly Joe Jones, Tony Williams, and Elvin Jones. There are ensemble playing examples where he will walk the viewer through parts of the song and explain what he's playing, why he's playing it, and the relationship between what he's playing and what is being played by the other musicians in the ensemble. There is much more as described by other reviewers, but suffice to say that this is a great DVD for drummers looking to develop musicality in both accompaniment and solos.",1336867200,7,1379,4.872340425531915
8507534,5,B00705R45W,"Ce dvd est un sommet de pdagogie et de musique pour les amateurs de jazz !!!
Ralph Peterson a une approche base sur la tradition et l'histoire. C'est une mine d'information sur les origines et le dveloppement du phras et du positionnement du batteur !
Les moments de musique sont incroyables eux aussi !
Voici un dvd parmi les meilleures vidos pdagogiques disponibles sur le march, le contenu est vraiment gnreux en plus.",1328140800,3,421,4.780821917808219
8507535,5,B00705R45W,Ralph Peterson!  This guy is so studied.  He really breaks concepts down.. really articulate teacher.  He has studied with the best.  Much of Alan Dawson's approach is made very clear and approachable.  This dvd is definitely a gem,1327276800,2,231,4.973684210526316
8507536,5,B00705R45W,"Ralph Peterson is one of the most respected drummers in jazz; and ""Jazz Drumming Demystified"" proves he's as good a teacher as he is a drummer. Previous reviews, posted above, speak of the chapter breakdowns. I'll mention that Ralph's video is not only instructive, but entertaining. I almost fell over laughing when he hauled out an ostrich feather and floated it down onto the floor tom to illustrate ""feathering"" on the bass drum. Ralph has a quartet of good jazz musicians who help illustrate jazz drumming in a musical setting. Ralph also emphasizes the importance of ""Learning the Tunes,"" which is critical to any serious jazz musician of any instrument. You have to know the canon of jazz standards to play jazz effectively. Ralph teaches a course at the Berklee College of Music where the students learn to play 50 jazz standards. Right on, Ralph. His section on playing uptempo bebop tunes is worth the price of admission for just that chapter.

Ralph is a real jazz drummer, not a former rock star who began playing jazz after making his millions. He's got the proper amount of ""slop"" in his technique, which lends his style the soulfulness heard in the recordings of the the truly great jazz drummers, men like Elvin Jones and Art Blakey and Philly Joe Jones, drummers whose styles Peterson demonstrates throughout ""Jazz Drumming DeMystified. Jazz drumming used to involve a mysterious process of learning, by frequenting the jazz clubs, getting to know the established drummers. The digital age now permits students of this music to gather much of the information it took musicians of earlier days years to gather. Drummers get a huge chunk of hard-won players knowledge in ""Jazz Drumming Demystified."" Right on, Ralph!",1327276800,5,1731,4.989619377162629
8507537,5,B00705R45W,"Ralph Peterson breaks it down!  Not all the great players are great teachers but Ralph Peterson is a master all the way around!  Lots of cool concepts, tips, and wisdom.  Amazing demonstrations.  Really inspiring!",1327190400,2,213,5.176470588235294
