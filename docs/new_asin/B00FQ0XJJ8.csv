8617910,5,B00FQ0XJJ8,"This was the 2013 offering from Moerbisch, <i>""Das grte Operettenfestival der Welt am Neusiedler See im sterreichischen Burgenland""</i> set in in Poland of 1704, as the show itself tells us.  I see that Moerbisch have their own ballet company now, as well as their own choir and orchestra -- up with the NY Met. So they obviously deserve the fulsome description of them that I have just given.  It was a performance of the popular <i>Bettelstudent</i> by Carl Millcker.  It was the first performance at Moerbisch with Dagmar Schellenberger as <i>Intendantin</i>.  She got that job as from 1. September 2012.  She was of course delighted to be so honoured. <i>""Ich freue mich wahnsinnig""</i>, she said in her exuberant way when her appointment was announced.

I note that she is described as KS Dagmar Schellenberger. I do know what that stands for:  <i>Kammersngerin</i> -- chamber singer.  I even spelled it right first time.  She is now formally referred to as <i>Frau KS Dagmar Schellenberger</i>.  It is an honorific title given to very distinguished singers of operas or operetta but I am not sure by whom it was awarded.  Dagmar certainly deserves it at any event.  I know that the Austrian culture minister awards the title in Austria so maybe culture ministers in the various German states also award it.  With her many performances throughout the German lands, Schellenberger could have got the title from various sources.  She SHOULD have got it from her native Saxony but as the Bible tells us, ""A prophet hath no honour in his own country"" (John 4:44) -- so maybe it was left to Austria to do the honours.

The performance had a lot in common with Gilbert & Sullivan.  About the first third of it was quite madcap.  I could have done without the wigs and absurd gowns but that was of course part of the comic setting.  The plot was typical operetta nonsense, complete with with deceptions and misunderstandings.  There was even TWO purloined letters.  No valuable pocket watches this time though.  So the plot lived up to expectations -- with some good twists towards the end

And the expected romance was also there -- though only in the second half. And the resolution of all difficulties at the end was also the expected operetta ending, but with a twist.  Instead of the lovers getting married, they were already married by that time!

A good show.  I  see that it has been performed over 5,000 times since 1882.",1436313600,,2428,4.804347826086956
8617911,3,B00FQ0XJJ8,"This issue is a bit of a disappointment.  The score is pretty undistinguished, the libretto cumbersome.  The Morbisch people give it their all, but the sum total is not up to the highest level that the company here routinely achieves.  It's not bad, but I'd say it's for people who want every operetta available.",1433203200,,312,4.7407407407407405
8617912,5,B00FQ0XJJ8,"Der Bettelstudent is Millocker's most famous operetta and is fairly popular in Austria and Germany.  Its music is quite pleasant, but does not have quite the sparkle of Strauss or Lehar.  Watching it on DVD leads to its strengths for it is clever, stage worthy, and, in this production very entertaining.  I have quite a few DVDs from the Morbisch Festival.  This is one of the best.  If you are familiar with Morbisch, you will know what to expect.  Singing, acting, sets and costumes are all excellent. Picture and sound on the DVD are also and you get a better view of the production than those sitting in the presumably high priced seats by the water.",1399852800,5,655,4.603448275862069
