2471791,5,B000CRR3CY,"The past 14 baseball seasons have put this Pittsburgh Pirates fan into a funky malaise, as year after year my Buccos rack up more loses than victories, and continue to stock their team with raw green youths and stop-gap, over the hill rent-a-players. So finding the 1979 World Series in this nicely packaged DVD format was just the remedy I needed to pull me out of my perennial baseball blues. What better way to escape from the melancholy gloom that is the Pirates present than to immerse oneself in their glorious past?

Watching this great World Series was like a wonderful family reunion. Everyone was there - Pops, Cobra, Teke, Scrap Iron, Mad Dog, Otter, Antelope, Candy Man, Sangy, Crazy Horse, Hammer, Rook, and on and on - the whole family. To once again see Willie Stargell windmill his bat and hit a majestic home run, or Kent Tekulve use that goofy side arm delivery to retire batters, erased for a moment the pain of the present and took me back to the days of my youth when the Pirates used ""lumber and lightning"" to dominate baseball, and their driving disco theme song ""We Are Fam-a-lee"" became a joyous anthem that lifted the hearts of every Pirates fan.

Even after putting aside my partisan preference, the 1979 World Series was a gem. It matched up two expert and colorful managers in Chuck Tanner and the cunning Earl Weaver, as well as the two powerful teams that included three future Hall of Famers (Willie Stargell, Eddie Murray, and Jim Palmer). The Pirates came back from being down three games to one to win the series on the power of an outstanding performance by Willie Stargell, who not only was named MVP of the series, but won baseball's MVP award that year in his final great season. Two games really stand out in my mind. Game two, when a late inning pinch hit by Manny Sanguillen (once the Pirates' star catcher, but relegated to the bench in the twilight of his career) provided the game winning RBI is the first. (Sanguillen later dedicated his hit to his late, great teammate, Roberto Clemente.) Game five is the other, perhaps the greatest in the series. Pittsburgh faced elimination after loosing two straight games at home, and Tanner, in a surprise move, gave the ball to an aging Jim Rooker, whose lousy season that year was a sign that his effective years were behind him. Rooker rose to the challenge and pitched like a champion, winning the game as the last hurrah of his career, and sending the series back to Baltimore.

As others have mentioned, the picture and sound quality vary from disc to disc, but nothing that can distract from the joy of seeing this great team win it all once again. The packaging is first rate - each game disc having its own case which displays its box score and details from the game. If you are a Pirates fans, you can't afford not to include this wonderful reminder of past glory in your collection, to watch whenever the gloom of our perpetual season of discontent gets you down.

2471792,5,B000CRR3CY,"I can honestly say that for about 15 years I've wanted to own this series. Now that I own it, I have not been disappointed in the least. If you are a Pirates fan, especially of the late 70's era, you will be in heaven! This edition comes complete with a separate casing for each DVD (7 in all), and liner stats included for each game (with inning by inning pbp). You can watch each game in its entirety, or skip to any half-inning.

Here are some notes to be aware of:

- The announcers from the original broadcast are included, making you feel like you've gone back in time.

- The games vary in quality, and I'm guessing that there might have been more than one original source when A&E tracked each game down. With that said, however, they are ALL better than I expected and easily watchable. Game 3 is the best quality, and Game 5 the worst.

- As someone said earlier, many of the graphics from games 2, 3, and 4 are simply missing. I believe these three games were taken from a different source as the others, as their screen quality is slightly superior.

- All the ""extras"" are placed on the last DVD with game 7. I especially liked Don Robinson's interviews. He sounded very sentimental. Dave Parker's 2 bullets (assists) during the '79 All-Star game are priceless.

- Every Pirate on the roster played at least once except pitcher Joe Coleman. Thus, you get a live look at nearly every player. Even Matt Alexander, who basically only pinch ran throughout the season, played in game 2 and spent an inning in the outfield.

- This is Parker's last great season with the Pirates ('80 was good, but not great - he would reemerge later with the Reds). Ironically, this is Stargell's last great season as well.

- Tekulve bounced back after a horrific game 4 (losing the game) and held off the O's in games 6 and 7.

- Those uniforms still hold a special place for me.

All in all, you can't go wrong with this. The quality is excellent for the time, and the games do not disappoint. Buy it NOW!!!",1148169600,28,2001,4.383783783783784
2471793,5,B000CRR3CY,"As someone who loves original broadcast footage of sporting events from the 1970's, it was with great aanticipation that I have waited for the 1979 World Series DVD collection. The 1979 World Series was a 7 game classic between two of the most succesful franchises of the 70's. Seeing the original ABC broadcast of these games with DVD quality is a real treat and brings back a lot of memories, even for a Cubs fan. The only negatives would be the following minor issues:

1. For some reason, the quality of Game 5 is not the best, particularly the last 5 innings.

2. Games 2,3, and 4 do not have most of the graphics from the original ABC broadcast.

Overall, it is very enjoyable to watch each game and the extras (including the 9th inning of Game 3 of the NLCS) and I would highly recommend it.

I'm now looking forward to the 1975 Red Sox-Reds World Series Release.

2471794,5,B000CRR3CY,"With a current record of 11-27, the 2006 Pittsburgh Pirates have given this fan of 18 years very little to cheer about. In fact, with the exception of the 97 season, the Pirates have done almost nothing since the heart breaking 92 NLCS and haven't produced a winning season since. With this DVD we can all go back in time and watch the 79 World Series where they didn't depend on one player, as in Stargell, to do everything for them. The 79 team had every player on the team contribute. Even the first game, a loss for the Pirates had plenty of decent play by the entire team after the 1st inning. Chuck Tanner uses his bullpen wisely and there's never a sense of doom and gloom the recent years has given us. These are not the Pirates I have gotten used to seeing the last decade and that's a good thing.",1147737600,6,806,4.2745098039215685
2471795,5,B000CRR3CY,This is vintage hard to find stuff of the '79 series. This is when the Pirates were a class organization. Back when a Pirates fan had something more to look forward to than the start of football season. This dvd set is most the Pirates fans have to look forward to since 1992.,1147478400,5,276,4.226415094339623
2471816,5,B000CRR3CY,"Re-live history.  I watched these games over 30 years ago, and to watch them again.... i am reliving those days.  i am caught up in this series.  if you are a pirate fan, and don't own this, you should.  it is fact.  it is history.  the last world series they were in, and probably ever will be for years and decades to come, and they won!  that is history.  and it happened.  they did a very nice job presenting this.  i am very impressed.  the entire world series, every play, play by play, as if you were watching it in 1979.  minus the commercials... even better.  when one inning is over, you go right to the next.  job well done!  It is refreshing to watch Willey Stargell hit home runs again!  I cant say enough good about this series on dvd.  each game is on its own dvd.",1384560000,,779,4.155405405405405
2471817,4,B000CRR3CY,"I'm neither a Pirate or Oriole fan, but I do recall brief memories of this series. It was nice to be able to travel back to this series and watch each individual game as if I were there. This was a time when I was finishing up Electronics school in Detroit at the age of 33, and getting ready to leave the factory for a job in electronics, which would eventually get me into broadcasting as an engineer. What a series it was for Willie Stargell and also for the Pirates, coming back from a 3 games to 1 deficit. A lot of nice features and a good price make this a valuable edition to my baseball collection.",1370736000,2,607,4.1525423728813555
2471818,4,B000CRR3CY,"I'm a longtime Pittsburgh fan and I have fond memories of the 1979 Pirates team and the World Series, so I was excited when I found this item. However, I must have misunderstood what I was ordering because I thought I'd be getting one or two DVDs with a synopsis of the series and interviews with players and commentary, etc. Instead, it's seven DVDs -- one of each game, and not much more at all. That's kind of disappointing to me. Don't get me wrong -- it's been great to watch these old players, my favorites, but I had hoped this would be like the NFL Films DVDs with commentary and interviews. Still, it's worth getting if you're a fan. Fabulous to relive.",1366502400,,662,4.390243902439025
2471819,5,B000CRR3CY,"We were at the three games in Pittsburgh in 1979 and have wanted a complete set of the games to re-watch and refresh our memories. (we did NOT forget how cold it was!) Also that fifth game all the fans seemed to realize at the same time that we WERE going to ""go all the way""!

This is a ""must buy"" for Pirate fans that want to remember the team that played baseball as it was meant to be played and with the basics
down pat!  This is the team that made believers out of many who doubted early in the season!

The seller sent it fast and well wrapped--it arrived in perfect condition and the product is exactly what I had hoped for.

I would recommend this to anyone and everyone!",1360195200,,680,4.128787878787879
2471820,5,B000CRR3CY,"I didn't expect to like this one the most, let alone at all, I bought it on a fluke, but wow.

This is the greatest comeback, probably in WS history, winning the final three games, the final two on the road, w/o the benefit of bad umpiring decisions.  They came back the old fashioned way.

Besides these points, the series offers an interesting view of life in the major leagues in this era.  Baseball lives on the crumbs that football leaves behind, playing in football arenas in Pitt, and in a chewed up field in Balt.  The uniforms, particularly the Bucs, are raucous.  Never was there so much color (unless perhaps the Astros).

Nevertheless, the field feels natural in Balt. It isn't an over manicured garden.  It feels like a day at the park.

The announcers have an interesting rapport, Drysdale's dry wit, Cosell's sometimes prescient calls, and Al Michaels in the middle.  There's more conversation than there is these days w Joe Buck's son (who sounds grim).

So in closing, I don't think a baseball fan can go wrong w this series.  A great series, great players.  I wish they'd release more from the 70s, such as 78, 73, 70....",1357689600,,1139,4.606965174129353
2471821,5,B000CRR3CY,"30+ years later, and I still harbor sickening feelings about being up 3 games to 1 and still blowing it; with the last 2 games being played in Baltimore, and we STILL couldn't clinch.  And of all people, Jim Rooker surviving Game 5 to keep Pittsburgh alive.

1971 was bad enough, but to go through this was especially painful.

I guess if you're a Pirate's fan, buy the entire package.  But if you're on O's fan, you'd welcome a set with just Games 1 through 4.",1352851200,,461,4.325581395348837
2471822,4,B000CRR3CY,"As a die-hard Pirate fan, there is not much to fall back on recently, but the history is rich, and reached it's pinnacle(to this point) in 1979. This amazing World series would be an excellent purchase for any baseball fan (much like the 1985 Royals-Cards DVD set) but if you are a fan of the Pirates then it is a must have.

Being able to see Willie Stargell, Dave Parker, Omar Mareno, and of course Kent Tekulve among many others including the great stars if the Orioles of the time is awesome, not to mention the commentary from Howard Cosell. There will never be another Howard Cosell!

The fact that this is the Pirates vs the Orioles in the World Series is also cool because niether team has been relevant in a while.

The series itself is very dramatic with alot of highs and lows for both teams, and even though I knew the outcome, I found myself on edge at times.

The picture quality varies between games but is watchable (remember this is 1979) and unfortunately the first few games are missing the screen graphics, but this is my only gripe on the games themselves.

Now the only reason I gave this a four and not a five is the extras. There are alot of them but they are all short and there is no season review. But the ones that are here are cool none the less. I would just like more, a longer post game celebration, more interviews, and again I was really surprised there was no season review!

All in all, a very good set, and I would like to see a 1971 series set if the games still exist. The game 7 1960 DVD is very cool also, but I will post that review later.",1337126400,,1581,4.253333333333333
2471823,5,B000CRR3CY,"The 1979 Pirates were a team that was reminiscent of another Pirate team:  the 1960 Pirates.  Both were World Series champions; and both made dramatic, come-from-behind victories seem almost habitual.

Unlike the 1960 Pirates, I was able to follow the 1979 Pirates from the first pitch of the season to the final out of this World Series.  And this video series is a wonderful way to re-live that memory.  Or educate young Pirate fans about the lessons that can be learned from one of the greatest teams in their franchise's history:  teamwork, facing adversity -- and just how to have some fun!

The NL East title was not even close to a run-away for the 1979 Pirates; they had to scrap it out until the final day of the season to earn their first post-season appearance in four years.  And many of their victories throughout the season were last-at-bat, come-from-behind victories.  After sweeping the Reds in the NLCS, they faced the favored Orioles in the 1979 World Series.  Following victories by each team in Baltimore, the Series moved to Pittsburgh, where the Pirates quickly found themselves deep inside of a precarious hole -- one loss away from defeat in the Series.

Moved by the passing of Skipper Chuck Tanner's mother on the morning of Game 5 (and perhaps reminded of past Pirate dramatics, with the ceremonial first pitch that day thrown out by Bill Mazeroski), the Pirates found new life in what had now become, for them, a do-or-die Series.  And they battled back to become world champions -- as well as the first MLB team to win a second World Series after having been down 3-games-to-1 (the first Pirate -- and MLB -- team to win a World Series in this fashion was the 1925 Pirates).",1310947200,,1704,4.700336700336701
2471824,5,B000CRR3CY,"I was pleasantly surprised upon reviewing the 1979 World Series DVD set. Although the technology from 1979 cannot compare, obviously, to that which we have today, most of the DVD videos were masterful reproductions. When I first bought the set, I questioned the sharpness and quality of the picture; would it at least be worth watching? Would I at least have 80 to 85% quality? To my surprise it is almost like watching the games live. As a Pirate fan waiting for the glory days to return it was fun looking back on some of successful Pirate history. This is an excellent buy for anyone that is a World Series history fan.",1301961600,,622,4.5625
2471825,5,B000CRR3CY,This is a great 7 game World Series between the two best teams in baseball that year.  Equally matched series unlike the World Series that happen today.  This is a must have for any person who remembers what great baseball was like.,1266710400,,232,4.5
2471836,5,B000CRR3CY,I am so pleased with the coverage. Not missing a pitch is great. I hope they come out with the 1971 series soon.,1240531200,,112,3.9130434782608696
2471837,4,B000CRR3CY,"Although I am an Orioles fan, and they lost this world series I enjoyed watching it in its entirety for the first time in almost 30 years.  This was my favorite Orioles team. The quality of this product was excellent until the final two games, when the video had several problems.  I was disappointed in the broadcast quality of game 7.  Other than that, I highly recommend this product.",1232323200,,387,4.579710144927536
2471838,5,B000CRR3CY,"This set is for any Pittsburgh Pirates fan who wants to remember what it was like when their favorite team was not a disgrace to sports. Personally, I loved the black and gold mix and match uniforms of the seventies so that was half the reason for getting this set. But the other half was to see this great baseball team in all it's glory. The Pirates and Orioles were dominant teams throughout the decade and they wrapped up the seventies in style. The Pirates became one of the few teams to come back from a 3 games to 1 deficit to win a World Series title.
As far as the video is concerned, I think that it is good overall. There are variances in video and sound at times, but they do not detract from the enjoyment of watching these games. I love putting a disc in at anytime and watching a few innings, or a whole game. Hearing Howard Cosell and Don Drysdale brings back good memories as well as the action on the field does.
I highly endorse this dvd set for any Pirates fan.",1229126400,,981,4.223404255319149
2471839,5,B000CRR3CY,"To make this short and sweet, even if you're not a Pirates fan, you'll appreciate this journey back in time with so many great characters like Pops and his windmilling, Eddie Murray's afro, Skinny Kent Tekulve and his glasses, Don Stanhouse's red afro, Tim Foli and his ultra-chokeup stance, Scrappy Garner, Nimble Omar Moreno and the list goes on and on. 70's baseball has gotten to a point where it has finally aged like a fine wine, and this series is a perfect example of that. One of the great games in this set is Game 4, a day game in Pittsburgh. Seeing the players play in the sun during the 70's is a real treat for any baseball fan. Also, the bonus material which includes a blend of old footage and recent interviews is wonderful stuff to watch. This Series and the '75 Series set are easily worth owning for the player/characters of their day.",1195430400,,855,4.487179487179487
2471840,5,B000CRR3CY,My boyfriend bought me the White Sox series and hinted that he wanted the Pirate's one. I got it for him for Valentine's Day and he was so happy. Thank you. This was a great gift!,1178928000,,179,4.0
2471841,4,B000CRR3CY,"In my opinion, NBC did a better job with baseball coverage in the '70's than ABC.  That said, ABC's coverage is in no way bad.  The announcing for the series is as follows: Keith Jackson, Don Drysdale, and Howard Cosell handle it in Baltimore, while in Pittsburgh Al Michaels replaces Jackson (Keith was working that weekend's Texas-Oklahoma game).  They do a good job on the broadcasts.  Jackson is of course, at the top of his game.  Drysdale provides good analysis and does a credible job on play-by-play, too.  Michaels does a nice job as well.  ABC probably felt they had to have Cosell on the World Series broadcasts since he was their most recognizable announcer.  While I certainly understand that some found him annoying, I thought he was alright.  Having said that, he has one of the phoniest-sounding laughs I've ever heard.

The video and audio quality vary on these discs.  Game 7's VQ is especially bad.  Also as previously mentioned, in three games ABC's original graphics have been removed for some reason.  The extras are good, with my favorite being the final half-inning of the NLCS clincher.

Overall, this is a very good set and a recommended purchase for baseball fans.  It's just not as good as it could have been.",1175299200,4,1237,4.768867924528302
2471842,5,B000CRR3CY,"Not just for Pirate fans. Even George Will has noted that about 2/3 of this team was of african or latin descent. You just don't see baseball like this anymore, it is worth the price of the dvd just to see Stargell whip his bat through the strike zone or watch the way Parker goes into second base. Today's baseball is tame and boring by comparison to these guys. Watch what happens after the 7th game when a Baltimore fan tries to get a souvenier from Steve Nicoscia.",1172361600,2,468,4.329545454545454
2471843,5,B000CRR3CY,"This is a must have for all die-hard Pirate fans. The video quality is very sharp, especially considering the games were played almost 30 years ago. I fully recommend this item",1168128000,,176,4.709677419354839
2471844,5,B000CRR3CY,"This set is absolutely incredible!  Every single pitch of the '79 World Series is here.  I was 12 when I last saw these games, and viewing them again has brought back so many memories.  From Stargell's dingers and Teke's funky deliver, to that weird rainbow head guy behind the plate in Baltimore.  It all came back to me the instant I saw it again.  Unlike today, all the players seemed to be enjoying themselves immensely, even when they were playing hurt.  And the comradarie between the two teams is refreshingly evident.  If you're interested in baseball (even a little bit), I highly recommend this.  If you're like Howard Cosell, who seemed more interested in arguing with Drysdale and checking out the player's wives, you won't be disappointed either.  These DVD's will get me through at least 2 or 3 more sub .500 Pirates seasons.",1159401600,11,839,4.770833333333333
2471845,5,B000CRR3CY,"I love watching old sporting events as they were originally broadcast.  That said, one thing that can make or break an old game for me is who is calling the action.  In this set, you can't go wrong as the great Keith Jackson does the play-by-play along with Don Drysdale and Howard Cosell in games 1, 2, 6, & 7.  Al Michaels fills in for games 3-5 while Jackson was away for the Texas/Oklahoma football game.  For those too young to remember him, Howard was a polarizing figure in sports journalism.  However, after watching games on FOX where we are constantly being bombarded by goofy special effects and screens polluted with every conceivable bit of information, Howard comes off as rather innocuous and insightful.  This is a great trip down memory lane.

The series itself is a great time capsule of baseball history featuring Hall of Famers Jim Palmer, Eddie Murray, Willie Stargell, and Bert Blyleven.  The games themselves are pretty exciting despite some of the worst defense you'll ever see in a World Series, and some pretty bad playing conditions for the first 4 games.  In games 1 & 2, Memorial Stadium is a mess with cold weather, rain, and two huge patches of mud in the outfield.  In games 3 & 4, the weather is also bad with garbage blowing all over the field, particularly in game 4.  The graphics are missing in games 3 & 4, but the quality of the audio and video is acceptable considering these games were played in 1979.  All in all, these are some fun games to relive.  Oh yeah, these are also some of the longest World Series games ever played so don't start watching a game if you don't have time to finish it.",1156377600,4,1635,4.520408163265306
8101221,5,B000CRR3CY,"This DVD got me completely back into baseball. I was a casual fan of the Mets at the time, but learning the story of the Pirates made this a must-have item. With a legendary collection of players and staff on both teams, this is seven games of some of the most dramatic baseball you'll see. The storyline of Chuck Tanner's mother dying during the series makes it all the more gripping when the Pirates march back from a 3-1 deficit in the series. Highly, highly recommended for even a casual baseball fan just due to the roster of hall of fame-level players present.",1492128000,,566,4.504854368932039
