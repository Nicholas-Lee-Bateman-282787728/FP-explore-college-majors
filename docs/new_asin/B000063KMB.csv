7959524,5,B000063KMB,"This is a tv series from the 70's in Britain, about a father and two teenage daughters. He is divorced and is a writer. The girls nanny lives with them. The stories are tame and sweet. Someone always gets the wrong end of the stick at the beginning and everything turns out okay at the end, with the viewer having a chuckle. You will need to have a multiregional dvd player to watch this in the USA as it is region 2.",1239840000,,417,4.097560975609756
