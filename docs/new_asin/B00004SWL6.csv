7922139,5,B00004SWL6,This video was checked out at the library by my 2 sons (5 and 2 yrs).  Our children's librarian asked me to 'test' it out on my kids.  It had been recommened that she purchase it for the library.  My kids LOVED the video.  It has great songs that aren't too irritating.  Original lyrics and kids get to watch an adult being goofy!  I give this an A+ rating.,1023840000,,357,4.101449275362318
