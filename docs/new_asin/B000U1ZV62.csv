2914123,4,B000U1ZV62,"I personally love to collect awful B movies like Over The Top and Tango & Cash.  The only one in this collection not worth watching is The specialist but I assure you Demolition Man, Over The Top and T&C are gems.  If you want you like ROBERT LOGGIA, the bad guy from Scarface, Frank, then you'll will laugh out loud during the arm-wrestling movie starring Stallone in Over The Top.",1222646400,,382,4.442857142857143

2914125,2,B000U1ZV62,"While Demolition Man, The Specialist, and even Over the Top are in the 16:9 format for widescreen TVs, Tango & Cash is not.  The video quality is pretty lousy as well. I feel like I'm watching this movie on VHS.",1213142400,9,211,4.275
2914126,2,B000U1ZV62,"Nothing wrong with the movie, just my copy had full narration throughout the whole movie from the director and producer, hopeless.",1210204800,4,130,5.238095238095238

2914128,4,B000U1ZV62,"Okay let's be brief:

If you want to kick-start a Stallone collection, this set is a good way to do it. You get one simple keepcase with a leaf inside that holds two double-sided discs. Each movie is exactly as they were released back in the late 90's/early 2000's on DVD, there's nothing new here. But this time they pressed each's anamorphic widescreen side ignoring the fullframe that was originally offered separately. All the movies in this set are single-layer, so don't expect a high bit rate, even though each film looks pretty darn good for standard DVD definition. It's well worth the $10 I paid for it.

Personally, I bought it to finally have a copy of Demolition Man, probably the best film here. But the others, especially if you're a Stallone fan to begin with, aren't too bad either. Warner Bros did a good job thinking up a new 4 Film Favorites line, and here's to hoping they do a ""Stallone Collection II"" in the future!

NOTE:I've heard that ""Tango & Cash"" isn't anamorphic like the box stated, but the others are (remember what I said, each of these are EXACTLY as they were originally released, and T&C was first released non-anamorphic). Still, it's a great bargain, it's up to you.",1195689600,25,1204,4.643192488262911
2914129,2,B000U1ZV62,"all the other films look good for what its worth as advertised except for one.  and of course that would be my favorite.

Tango and Cash is NOT in 16x9 anamorphic format as stated on the back of the DVD.  this is the same dirty print that was so shoddy in it's first presentation. let's hope Warner Bros does the right thing is replace the bad disc or issue a special edition of sorts",1194912000,11,384,4.162162162162162

2914295,5,B000U1ZV62,"I will be buying this set.

I must start off, though, by refuting ""JT""'s review.  For the longest time, I absolutely did not like Stallone at all.  Not a fan of Rambo, had not even seen Rocky.

And then a new Kurt Russell film came out that happened to also star Sylvester Stallone--Tango and Cash.  I absolutely loved it!  And I saw Demolition Man.

These two are still two of my favorite action films.  But, yes, because of those two movies, I have also become a fan of Stallone and have now eagerly seen many of his films.  And now I see films because he's in them.  Love the Expendables series!

So I will buy this set for Tango and Cash and Demolition Man.  Two long time favorites.",1440547200,,687,4.28125

Over the top I loved that movie all what a father did to be with his kid, how he won the respect and love even though the odds were against him.

For the life of me I cannot find out how to turn it off, there are no options for that. When I watch it on any other media player such as my Sony Blu Ray player it is not an issue.

2914427,4,B000U1ZV62,"This is only a review of the product itself, namely the tech specs and A/V quality.  This set contains two flipper discs, one movie on each side.  Even though most of the movies start automatically, you do have the menu screens available.

First off, a couple reviewers have said that Demolition Man only has the audio commentary track and you can't disable it.  Either there's something wrong with their DVD players or Warner went back and re-authored the discs after fixing the problem and those two unfortunately got the bad version.  My copy had three audio tracks for DM:  regular English 5.1, Spanish 5.1, and commentary.

There IS however one big problem that annoys me:  Tango & Cash is NOT in anamorphic widescreen as the back of the case leads you to believe.  It's a de-zoomed 2.35:1 frame with bars on all four sides.  So you're either stuck with that or you can use the zoom on your TV but that  shows off the degraded resolution all the more.

Audio on the first three films is Dolby 5.1 @ 384 kbps, while Over The Top is Dolby 2.0 @ 192 kbps.  Also of note is that Over The Top has the modern WB logo overlaying the intro of the film's score.

Video bitrates are a respectable ~5 Mbps on the first three films, and Over The Top levels out in the 6-7 Mbps range, making that a nice compensation for the lower resolution audio.",1405555200,5,1340,4.438524590163935

2914487,4,B000U1ZV62,".........and your lines cheesy, and your violence deadly, then look no further! How is this collection NOT already in your library!

Tango & Cash - your textbook, almost superhero, prime of life, Anglo males taking on corrupt baddies who, apparently, can only function if these TWO cops are taken off the scene. And by taken off the scene I mean (spoiler alert) sent to jail and then snuffed out. Jack Palance plays a villain which is his bread and butter. I can't even imagine him not being a bad guy on film. Perfect film from that era.

The Specialist - Incredibly generic film, but minus the fun, or the (over) acting that makes Tango pop. Not bad, but not that great either.

Over The Top - Single father, looking to stay connected with his son. Robert Loggia as the jerk father in law. And, EVERYONE'S first glimpse into the very much a real thing world of professional arm wrestling. An utterly perfect film.

Demolition Man - I understand why this movie didn't blow people away. Looking back on it, though, it should've. Snipes absolutely slays as the film's antagonist. Doesn't have a wasted line in the entire film, and is scarily accurate in his execution. Stallone is Stallone, no more no less. Bullock plays a loveable......plays a likeable character as a new age police officer with a thirst for (old school) action.

2914489,3,B000U1ZV62,I wish I had known this before purchasing this dvd that Demolition Man is COMMENTATED throughout the movies by the directors.  I am a big Sly fan and this is VERY disappointing!  This would have been a five star review.,1355097600,,219,4.45
2914490,5,B000U1ZV62,"Outside the Rocky movies, the best era for Sly Stallone was the late 80's - 90's! And, this set of DVDs captures him, at what I believe, is at his best. Highly recommend, you won't regret adding these to your DVD collection!",1349740800,,224,4.357142857142857
2914491,4,B000U1ZV62,"I had the same problem with Demolitian Man until I read another review that stated how to fix the problem and it worked for me.  To turn off the audio commentary go to Special Features.  Then look under the Languages menu option. Now to turn it off you have to select English from the first column of options, which then causes the subtitles to be turned on. So now you have to go back to the same menu, Languages, and this time move to the second column, subtitles, and select off.",1343433600,36,482,4.285714285714286

2914493,4,B000U1ZV62,"Always loved a good action flick or two. Grew up watching Sly, Arnie & Bruce so this was a get little collection of some of Sly's films. Great for a lazy weekend spent in front of the TV",1309132800,,186,3.9210526315789473
2914526,3,B000U1ZV62,"The quality is good. I gave it a 3 because it comes with 2 movies on one side, so you have to flip it to play the next movie, and the writing is so fine, you can hardly see it",1307664000,,175,3.4
2914527,4,B000U1ZV62,"I have had quite a bit of dissappointments with online purchases of movie titles, especially onces that come in ""sets"" of multiple titles set on one or more discs.

This one, however, was not too soft to hear, it did not have fuzzy images and had no visible or audible blemishes of any kind.  I was pleasantly surprised.",1298160000,,320,4.5
2914528,2,B000U1ZV62,"When I think of my favorite Sylvester Stallone films, I think of ROCKY, FIRST BLOOD, NIGHTHAWKS, not ANY of these films. I'd pick ROCKY IV over OVER THE TOP, RAMBO II instead of THE SPECIALIST. This is just a pile of mediocre Stallone films in an attempt to actually SELL them.

DEMOLITION MAN is probably the best of the bunch (however some reviewers are claiming that you can't turn off the director's commentary, so beware). Unlike the other action films Stallone or several others have been in, this film has a clever sense of humor, thanks in part to some hilarious banter from Wesley Snipes. Stallone is the perfect straight man, but the role of the comic foil is handed to Sandra Bullock. Quite simply, she isn't funny. After a funny setup of the pacifist future San Angeles, and Stallone and Snipes a pair of 90s rivals doing battle in the future, the film gets bogged down by typical action boredom. Do check out the foreshadowing of Arnold Schwarzenegger's political career as Sly and Bullock discuss ""President Scharzenegger,"" funniest moment in the movie.

TANGO & CASH has its moments. Kirt Russel and Sly turn out to be a well-matched comedic pair, but the story is so one-dimensional, and there really is no payoff at the end. Better than COBRA, but still not worth it.

THE SPECIALIST is incredibly boring. I couldn't even sit through the whole movie, falling asleep within 30 minutes of the film.

OVER THE TOP is probably the worst here, although I enjoyed it more than THE SPECIALIST. At least the title perfectly describes the film: OVER THE TOP. I think Norm MacDonald really outlined this movie perfectly: ""It combines the emotional drama of a child custody battle with... ARM WRESTLING!"" And that's basically, the whole movie. How Sly could have possibly though Arm Wrestling would be an interesting sport is beyond me, however the final match does leave you on the edge of your seat. The big problem is Stallone's son, who is unbearably annoying as is the whole premise to this stupid plot involving his grandfather. However, if you are an avid Stallone fan, than you have to watch this!

If you're not much of a Stallone fan, I highly recommend ROCKY, which is simply one of the best movies of all time. Some of the sequels, II, III and ROCKY BALBOA are good too. His best action movie? Probably RAMBO, although I think FIRST BLOOD is much higher quality film in terms of plot, execution, and political statement. Get those movies before checking out this ""Film Favorites"" and you'll see it is improperly titled.",1297296000,,2537,4.756818181818182
2914529,5,B000U1ZV62,"Bought this for Demolition Man but Tango & Cash/The Specialist are great movies too!  As for Over the Top, never say it the first time probably will never see it now that I own it!!!",1297296000,,182,4.2

I ordered this DVD for Tango & Cash, & Demolition Man. T&C plays fine, but Demolition Man has the stupid Director audio commentery throughout the whole thing, & it cannot be turned off. Sure enough I checked the reviews
more thoroughly & found other warned of this same thing. So buyer Beware!!!",1267401600,21,434,4.576923076923077
2914532,4,B000U1ZV62,"Great to find such a movie collection in one set.  The 4 movies are contained on 2 double-sided dvds, brand new.  I ordered 3 copies so I could share with family.  The 3 copies were ordered together but I was charged shipping and handling for all 3 copies and each was mailed in its own package (all showed up together the same day).

2914534,3,B000U1ZV62,"This was a great idea to put all four movies together, and if you are a Stallone fan, its a great deal. Thing is, they  rip you off with the Demolition man movie. Throughout the ENTIRE movie, the directors, producers are all talking through it about the scenes, etc. Really pissed me off because that was probably the best movie out of all four, maybe the Specialist can compete with it w/e. All in all it was still a pretty sweet deal even with the rip off Demolition man on the back side of the dvd. Id buy it again.",1240617600,2,518,4.18
2914535,4,B000U1ZV62,"My two absolute favorites in this set are on the flip-side of each other: Demolition Man and Tango & Cash. They're action-packed and have touches of humor.

One being Kurt Russell dressed as a woman and wearing spike heels in Tango & Cash. The combination of Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell was right on the money. They play well off of each other. Their characters are direct opposites but both are good and effective cops. In fact, too effective because they're both set up by the same criminal whose business they keep busting up. They both get jail sentences and are supposed to go to a minimum security facility but the crime boss works it so they go to a grungy maximum security prison where he owns the guards and where there are a lot of guys that Tango and Cash have put away. They escape and do their own investigating and clear their names while getting ""the gov'nor"" who set them up.

Stallone as the good ""mad man"" going after the bad ""mad man"" Wesley Snipes in Demolition Man was a good hate-hate relationship and led to many great action fights and pursuits. It takes place in the future where society is devoid of violence and people have ""joy-joy"" feelings above ground where anything deemed not good for you is outlawed - like salt on food. But, the people who choose to live with all the unhealthy things are living underground and have to forage for their food. Jesse Ventura has a small part as one of Snipes' thawed-out criminals.

The Specialist has a lot of explosive action with a bit of romance between the assassin Stallone and the calculating, vengeful Sharon Stone. The two share a very hot shower scene.

Over The Top is not as action-packed but it's a good story about a disconnected father and son who are put together after the wealthy mother dies and it's her last wish that the trucker/arm wrestler father get to know his son, so they go on the road together. It took some time for them to get along because the son was a spoiled rich kid whose grandfather did not like his father and greatly objected to the father (Stallone) having anything to do with his own son. The son's knowledge of his father was greatly influenced by his grandfather's viewpoint. But, in the end, the father/son become a duo as the grandfather pushes a little too hard against Stallone, in addition to under-estimating the bond that occurred by the two being together.",1223510400,9,2383,4.6
