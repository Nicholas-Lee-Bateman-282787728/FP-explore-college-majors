7909478,4,B00000I1KR,The Outcast (Fortune Hunter) is a very stunning story of life in the American West. The story went a little slow for me...but had a good ending. I recommend this movie to those who have an interest in western films.,1393891200,,215,4.4
7909479,5,B00000I1KR,"You never know what you're getting from some of these manufacturers, but this Jubal Classics release of the color Republic western THE OUTCAST is very nice.  It will, however, require an all-region DVD player.",1364860800,,209,5.147058823529412

However what I am really interested in would be a DVD version of that movie which would be playable in the United States.  There are foreign versions available but not playable in the USA.",1349049600,,258,4.48936170212766
7909481,4,B00000I1KR,"The Outcast is set in 1880s Colorado about a man who rides into town with a gang of hired gunmen to reclaim his inheritance. But the man opposing him is none other than his uncle, who will not give up the ranch, and all that goes with it, without a fight.

A truly pleasant surprise to me this one was. Too many times I care to mention when I have sat down for a B movie Western and cringed at the banality on show. Directed by prolific B helmer William Witney and coming out of the mightily solid Republic Pictures house, The Outcast {AKA The Fortune Hunter} uses a standard story premise and expands it further with a multitude of interesting character arcs. There is so much going on in this part of Colorado, the film never has time to become boring or twee in its execution. Each character serves a purpose, if they have screen time then they are functional to the plot{s} in hand. We have feuding families, hired thugs, a pugilist blacksmith, reams of gun play, fist fights on horseback {fine stunt work here} and pretty gals pulling the male protagonists emotions left and right! All set against a lovely rolling location backdrop {sadly not able to find where at the time of writing} and filmed in the safer cheaper colour aspect of Trucolor, which looks nicer now in this day and age of HD TV.

The cast are led by John Derek (All the King's Men) and an assortment of stoic and professional Western players fill out the roll call. It does look to be either largely unseen or consigned wrongly to the B movie bin. But it's certainly a must for the Western genre fan, and definitely a film to prove that Republic Pictures did have good films in their locker. So do check it out if you get the chance 7/10",1318204800,2,1711,4.394321766561514
