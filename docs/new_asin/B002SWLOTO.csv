8379695,5,B002SWLOTO,"This production provides some rarely seen insight into the trip along the former Southern Pacfic line between Mount Hermon and Santa Cruz. There is very little narration, and you get to see places that are otherwise not accessible without hiking on the tracks (which is illegal). If you like unusual perspectives on scenic rails, this is a great DVD.",1502323200,,350,4.9491525423728815
8379696,2,B002SWLOTO,"This DVD was nothing much at all, just a real let down I thought. Dont waste your time, and money with it. There wasn't anything to see dueing that short train trip. And the overall picture was not very clear.",1381363200,,209,4.25
