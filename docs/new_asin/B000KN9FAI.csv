8158293,5,B000KN9FAI,"""Hardwood Dreams 1 and 2,"" What wonderful stories of 5 High School Students at Morningside High School. I enjoyed following them and learning about their personal stories. 1, Sean, 2, Dwight, 3, Domonic, 4, Stais and 5, Corey  were all outstanding basketball players. Their Team was called, ""The Monarch."" You must have ""Harwood Dreams 2"" as well to find out what happened to each of them 10 years later. These 2 movies were Narrated By Wesley Snipes, My Favorite Actor of all time. His voice is unique and so distinguished. These 2 DVDs are worth having because they are very Heart Warming and Heart Felt. 5 Stars Plus Plus!",1345420800,,625,4.73394495412844
8158294,4,B000KN9FAI,"I liked this movie, but I wish there was more basketball footage and a little more singling out of the players as they played. The personal sides were fine, but I thought there needed to be a little more balance of the basketball side of it. I really enjoyed part 2 because it put a lot of things in perspective on where basketball did and didn't take them. I thought there was a lot better basketball coverage on part 2, and maybe that's because they had 10 years to make a better effort. I wouldn't mind seeing something like this done again.

Part 2 is a great watch for ballers who are doing the ""all or nothing"" thing with basketball. The life side of 10 years later was very interesting. Most of the kids I teach watch for the basketball side of things, so they might lose interest in this feature, so I would recommend it for a more open audience.",1240185600,,854,4.304347826086956
