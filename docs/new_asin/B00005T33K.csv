When I first started I had a significant amount of weight on me and I was able to do the videos.  I recommended it highly for people who can not bounce around but want to lose weight.  You get a really good fat burning workout!
The music is corny & there are some mistakes in the video, but other than that you will lose weight with these videos and they are not difficult.",1010534400,18,524,4.0

This really works!  I have lost weight and inches already!  These workouts are easy, but they WORK!  I have cut back on junk food, so I am not doing a major life changing diet, yet its still working.  I am a clutz and get very tired easy, I have no coordination, but I can do these!  :)
There is no jumping around and you need very little room, which is a plus.  I find Leslie very easy to follow and I don't feel lost with whats going on like with Richard Simmons tapes.",1008201600,508,729,3.952054794520548

I wanted to get Leslie Sansone's DVD as I am a Christian and was concerned about the ""spiritual"" aspect of the yoga practices.  Knowing she is a Christian also, I knew there would be no meditation or chants which I would appreciate.  However, there is not that much ""yoga"".  It's probably great for an introduction or for somebody that has never done any other yoga session.  I do like the mile walk which finishes with the yoga stretches.  I do rotate my routines/DVDs so I am using this weekly.  Hope this helps.",1504483200,4,594,4.336363636363636

1658888,4,B00005T33K,"...that seemed to be for an entirely different workout, I ordered this anyway and I'm glad I did.  It is older (previously released) stuff, so if you have a lot of Leslie workouts you might want to check first.

There are two workouts:

YOGA WALK is a one mile walk with Leslie (and two other walkers) followed by 10-15 minutes of yoga and stretching.  It perfect when you want a little exercise but don't want to break much of a sweat.  The walking moves are easy and familiar and the yoga ones are not difficult.

YOGA BASICS is entirely yoga, featuring Leslie only.  The first 15 minutes or so she goes through each pose, then she does all the poses as a 25 minute yoga workout.  She's much more subdued than usual, but still a little too chatty at times (personal preference, I don't like chatty during yoga).  The yoga poses are pretty basic, definitely beginner friendly, and she does show modification by using blocks a few times.

I did the yoga walk followed by the 25 minute yoga workout this morning and I felt great afterward.  Got a little cardio in and my whole body felt stretched afterward.",1480636800,4,1106,4.507537688442211

1658900,1,B00005T33K,"Shame on Gaiam and Leslie! I feel cheated - I was so excited to see this DVD! Her ""You Can Do Yoga"" DVD is great so I thought this was a new one with other great workouts of yoga. I am very disappointed - this is a re-release of a previous DVD. This should be clearly stated somewhere, in the posting, in the publicity. . .
Gaiam/Leslie may have sold a DVD, but I am hesitant to purchase any more from her from Amazon - I will have to see the DVD in person so I can inspect it for ""previously released"" notice. I shouldn't have to do research to find out if a DVD is original or re-released.
I may not even buy any more of her DVD's - I don't like tricks being played on the buying public. There are plenty of other great work outs on the market - Debbie Rocker, just to name one, has a great series of work out with walking DVD's.",1480118400,2,831,3.9523809523809526

Her DVDs keep me in shape and keep my weight down. Since I have the attention span of a gnat, I need variety in my workouts. Therefore I have a dozen of her workouts because some days I want cardio, some days I want strength training with the resistance band or dumbbells, other days I choose a workout based on how many miles I have time to do or feel like doing. I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoy this older DVD of hers. The Walk Strong has very good strength training intervals (I use 5# dumbbells), the Walk & Kick is loads of fun and I worked up a good sweat, and the Walk & Jog has four 2-minute intervals of jogging that gets your heart pounding! If you are used to the newer workouts, you'll have to get past the boring background and completely unresponsive cast but I don't care. I'm doing the workouts to stay in shape.

This is just exercising at its best. And I love using weights in the various exercises. Great Leslie. Start going back to your original ways. Get rid of all the young babes. Stick with gals or guys your age because I bet the majority of your viewers are over 45 yrs old. There are plenty of presenters that cater to the youth so let them.",1465344000,3,665,4.203125

It is primarily a video teaching you various yoga positions (not necessarily an exercise). It says that in the description, but I assumed it would be at least a minimal workout during the tutorial. No. Very slow. Very boring. I am apparently not a Yoga person. There is a short walk at the end followed by a short Yoga routine, but not worth it in my opinion.

1658950,3,B00005T33K,"The workouts are easy and fun, but there isn't a lot of variety, so they can become pretty repetitive. Plus, Leslie won't tolerate even a moment of silence, so she talks throughout every workout, and the sound of her constant chattering can get on your nerves. If you need a quick walking workout to do a couple times a week (or preferably just when it's not nice enough weather to walk outdoors), this is great.

It also includes the 30 minute upper-body workout where she uses a chair and arm weights from her DVD ""Leslie Sansone: Walk Away The Pounds - 7-Day Calorie Blast"".

Muscle Mile One is my all time favorite Leslie walk, so the DVD is worth it to me for that one alone.  I also like the 30 Minute walk as well.  I have not tried Walk Strong yet, and I don't see myself getting a lot of usage out of the Walk Diet or Pilates workout.  I tend to use other instructors for pilates primarily.

This DVD includes, Walk & Jog, Walk & Kick, Walk Strong and Power Mile.  Power Mile and Walk & Kick are my favorites from this set, I find Walk & Jog to be too manic in spots mainly because I don't care for jogging.  There is a modifier that will sub walking moves in place of the jogging but I find it a little hard to keep up.  Walk Strong is a nice little workout that alternates walking with weight toning segments.  I haven't used this workout much though as I have many other weight ones that I reach for instead.  Length wise, Power Mile is a shorter fast paced one mile workout, where the other three are all two miles.

Overall, I am glad to have picked this one up, as this one includes her older workouts which I tend to prefer.  I give this one 4 stars.",1451692800,,890,4.255952380952381
1658968,5,B00005T33K,"I am very pleased that this workout was released and pounced on it immediately.  It is a compilation of two of Leslie's older workouts, the Morning Mile and the Evening Mile.  It should be noted though that the original Morning Mile workout also had an ab section, and the Evening Mile workout had a legs section.  These two added toning sections are NOT included in this compilation.  These are the walking workouts only, and they are each a mile.  The Morning Mile is more faster paced, where the Evening Mile is slowed down.

Leslie has a boatload of walking videos, I find that I prefer her older offerings more than her current ones.  She has many compilation DVDs and it is nice to see these two workouts offered for a change.  I have only seen the Evening Mile on one of the compilation DVDs, and this is the first I have seen of the Morning Mile on a compilation set.

I only have a few of Leslie's compilation DVDs but find that I use them quite a bit.  I fully plan to do lots of walking with Leslie in 2016.

1658974,5,B00005T33K,I LOVE this dvd set!! I used it faithfully last winter to get a work out in. It is perfect for the beginner who isn't confident enough to get in the gym. I worked my way up from the 1 mile to the 3 mile and with the weights added it is a full body workout. I recommend everyone has this as a go to or back up workout. I can't say enough good things about it.,1445472000,24,358,3.6623376623376624

1658979,5,B00005T33K,This is my favorite Leslie Sansone video. Especially the 2 mile. But she sure picks on that poor lady. The lady looks like she wants to go to fist city with her.

I am in a wheelchair now, but I homeschooled four children in Middle and High School years. Her workouts were the one thing I required them to do every day before we started book work. I would recommend these to any one at any age. The workouts are very balanced and if there is a specific area that needs targeting or a longer work out is needed, there is a DVD for them.",1434067200,4,518,4.038834951456311

My favorite is the 20min Power Mile with weights. When I have little time, I can STILL get in my exercising with this one and the weights are great upper body builders. Sometimes I will do part w/ 3# weights and the more strenuous elements w/ 2# weights. 2nd favorite is the Power Mile. This alternates walking with weight training. Again, I will use different weights for different exercises and enjoy that she shows different 'levels' depending on your ability. And the fact that you get FOUR workouts on one DVD is great value plus I don't have to keep changing from one DVD to another.",1427500800,,734,4.485074626865671

I love that if I get bored with one workout there are two more to do.  I read some of the reviews that complained that there was nothing new on this video.

I have many of Leslie's videos and the thing I liked about this one compared to newer ones is there is less flash but very basic workouts that are effective,  I like to combine workouts and I like being able to combine an aerobic with strength training.  Her Walk Strong Express on this video did this well and the Pilates workout was just right to do after one of the walking videos.  She is very good at basic floor work.  I like that she doesn't get up and down from floor or try to do some contorted drill to make an impression.  She is encouraging and if you consistently do her workouts, you will see results without injury.",1426809600,,796,4.273333333333333

But for most people, you don't need this or any other gimmick to enjoy a good life.  You'll do all right if you get a reasonable amount of exercise and eat real food, including lots of fruit and vegetables.  Learn to cook if you do already know how.

I use this for a low impact aerobic exercise for days when I can not get out. Good cardio exercise with peppy variety and music. I also like that the people with her are normal looking and not overly thin. There are a couple of people that are obviously over 40. She also emphasizes adapting exercise to your own needs.
I have a set of 1 pound weights that I use instead of her work out balls. Watching the same people do the same exercises on a regular basis can get boring so I just ordered her Walk Blasters video.
I do not plan to use this daily, probably once a week or so along with other workouts (I like variety).

As I write this review, I've slowly increased the ""stars"" because I realize that I use this CD when I really don't want to work out.  It's simple, a one mile walk and then some elementary yoga poses.  It serves the purpose of my being able to say ""At least I did this"" which, of course, is better than nothing.  But it also offers me the opportunity later in the day to use either of my two favorite Leslie workouts:  Walk off even more weight (which comes with a weighted waist band) and Punch up your walk (comes with weighted wrist gloves).",1406764800,16,688,4.3023255813953485

Many people underestimate it because they think a walking DVD won't give them a great workout.  Not the case,  you can choose from 3 workouts, One mile, Two mile, and the 3 mile workout. I know a lot of people who bought the water weights had issues.  I still had my original weighted balls with sand and they have held up for a long time.

1659221,5,B00005T33K,I love all of leslie sansone's dvds.  This one is a particularly good value because it's a consolidation of 5 workouts.  It prevents boredom.  Leslie demonstrates that you don't have to kill yourself to get an honest workout.,1395014400,2,225,4.868421052631579
1659222,5,B00005T33K,"I just got this DVD last week, the 3rd one that I have from Leslie Sansone. I'm really impressed by what's included in this DVD.

Yesterday, I tried the  Muscle Mile One segment, using 3 lb. dumbbells and it was wonderful. The mile breezed by and at the end, in spite of how quickly I was finished, I still felt like I had had a good workout. Adding the weight really does 'bump up' the workout, in a significant but easy way.

I also reviewed the other 2 segments and am looking forward to trying both of them very soon.

I like Leslie's enthusiastic and happy attitude, the moves, the music....everything!

The only thing I didn't find was the distance of the Walk and Jog segment, but someone has kindly mentioned here that it's 2.5 Miles, so now I know. I always like to know how much distance I cover in any walking workout, that info. should be added if this package is re-issued.

This will be a DVD that I will be using, again and again. Recommended!",1394928000,5,958,4.353932584269663

1659224,5,B00005T33K,I am truly a Leslie Sansone junkie as probably Amazon could attest to. I have 25 of her DVDs so I have enjoed working out with her for many years. She is always very upbeat as most evryone would agree and she just makes working out easy and fun and it is easy to get in shape with her DVDs. I love the variety of workouts I have of hers so it is easy to always look forward to working out everyday! This particular DVD is back from the old days with her instructors who I feel I know. And it has been very enjoyable doing this DVD. Leslie is a fabulous workout inspiration!,1392681600,,573,4.035087719298246
1659240,5,B00005T33K,I thought I was pretty out of shape but I could do the 2-mile right out of the gate.  I have an old fracture and some arthritis in my right big toe and ball of my foot.  It can hurt pretty bad when I walk too much.  This program is more 'marching' than walking so I'm not rolling on to the part of my foot that is injured.  It works great.,1392249600,3,339,3.732394366197183
1659241,4,B00005T33K,"If you are looking for some variety in your workouts this might be a good choice. This DVD has four fat-burning workouts. The first workout is interesting because you use weights through the entire workout. I used three-pound weights and it was great. It does however require a lot of coordination as you will be doing lots of lower body exercises at the same time you are doing upper body exercises.

The second workout is called Walk Strong because you will again be using weights. Leslie alternates walking with weigh lifting. This requires a lot of balance and the weight lifting makes your heart work faster. I'm guessing this is her most intense workout. At least I thought it was more intense than any of her other workouts I've ever tried.

The third workout is called Walk and Jog. Leslie alternates walking and jogging to get the heart rate up in a moderate way. If you don't want to jog there are alternatives.

The fourth workout is all about kick boxing. I'm not a huge fan of this type of workout but I actually did enjoy it. Mostly it is walking moves interspersed with boxing and small kicks.

I did all the workouts in one day and that was maybe a bit much. You also have to select each workout they don't all run together. I felt this mostly in my core!

1659242,5,B00005T33K,"Very happy with the price and quick delivery. I have many Leslie Sansone DVDs. Even though this is one of her older DVDs, it is my favorite; I especially like the ""Walk & Jog"" routine. One day I do it exactly as Leslie does, then the next day I incorporate other moves into it from some of her other DVDs. I exercise almost daily and never tire of any of her routines. I cannot imagine myself starting a day without Leslie!! If I am pressed for time, I will at least get in the ""Muscle Mile One"" routine.  If time permits and I want to do something different, the ""Super Challenge"" works! Exercising with Leslie is the best way I have found to stay in shape. Along with a healthy diet and Leslie, it is unbelievable how toned my ""senior"" body is! This was purchased as a gift for my sister and she is enjoying it as well.",1391299200,5,821,4.19620253164557
1659243,5,B00005T33K,"I love these videos. They are the absolute best for people just starting to work out because you can really tailor it to your ability. You also don't need much space and if you choose - just a simple set of hand weights. Even for those in decent shape you can make these harder by squating lower and raising your legs higher. This will never be a P90x, but I will never be able to or want to do a P90x. lol.  I also find these are great for those days where you are hurting or don't feel like exercising. It gets you moving and although it may not be your best workout you still move and it's easy to talk yourself into a walk versus a hard areobic or weight video. On some days I will also use the first 10-20 minutes as a warm-up for some other exercise.  These will always be a staple in my video library.",1388620800,2,808,4.04375

She gets you up off the couch, onto the floor and makes you Walk, Walk Walk away those pounds.  This is a good DVD to buy if you are like me and feel that you don't have a lot of rhythm.  Leslie uses the same four basic moves but  bumps up the speed to get the heart rate up so you can burn those calories.  Before starting to walk with Leslie Sansone everyday in the privacy of my home, I was weighing 207 pounds.  I am now down to 154 almost at my goal of 140.

I really find the Walk Strong and the Walk and Jog to be so much better for me. I get my heart rate up, and I really feel like it's a full aerobic work out. I feel much better physically in the couple weeks I've been incorporating this into my routine. I try to do one of these two 30 minute programs 3 times a week. It's manageable, and I feel so much better. The bonus has been losing some pounds, which was the reason I wanted to get exercising again. I can't run anymore (knee problems) but I don't find the jogging too crazy. You can adjust to your own needs. It's just a really intense, fun workout, and I feel I get pretty good results in not a lot of time.

1659297,5,B00005T33K,"In my opinion, this DVD is not really in miles. Maybe the first part is, but not the rest. Leslie has said quite a few times that its NOT sissy stuff and this DVD will prove it. When I first did the this workout, I was kind of detached. But I did it again today and now it's one of my favorites.

I am 26 years old, 158-7 pounds and she has helped me lose 15 pounds. My BMI is 27.1 I was able to catch up and do the entire workout at one time. From my heart monitor I burned 637 calories! I did this workout DVD twice and came out around the 600 calorie count every time. So again, this is an intense workout and if you want a challenge, this is it. Now, if you do it just one or two levels a day, it may not be so tough, but all levels in one day...yea, the 637 will burn.

**Menu Options**
1) Power Mile
2) Walk Strong
3) Walk & Jog
4) Walk & Kick

The power Mile is between medium and high movements. About halfway into the workout she'll introduce some sculpting, which I think was pretty good for the arms. And it's not just for 1 or 2 minutes. She'll stick it in there for a good while. I'd suggest you use 2 pound weights becuase there's one move she did that was too hard for 5 pound weights. This workout lasts about 20 minutes.

The Walk Strong section introduces excellent sculpting. She'll do this pattern about four times. There is also some lunges and squatting with the weight-lifting. This workout is about 33 minutes. And I think that adds up to two miles.

Walk & Jog was the section where I was getting short of breath. I mean WHOOOO! It's very brisk! You'll jog for 2-minute intervals four times. This includes the regular jog, boosted kicks and leg swings. Ladies you also want to put on a good sports bra for this level. There's a lot of bouncing. This Workout is about 33 minutes as well.

The Walk & Kick level is pretty calm. She'll have you do four intervals of light kickboxing. I haven't seen her do double knee-lifts in the other sections but this one...I hate double-knee lifts! This is about 33 minutes too.

***Pros***
1) Leslie demeanor is VERY calm. And I mean CALM CALM CALM. She has the smile stuck on her face all day, but if you're used to her more current workout DVDs you can tell the difference. It's almost as if she's a different person.

2) Her key in executing between different moves is about 4.8/5. So she won't screw you up or confuse you a lot. But remember, she is talking throughout the exercise. So, that may be difficult for her.

3) The workouts really get the job done. You will sweat and you will feel your heart pounding greatly. When I did this twice, my body ached a lot! And it was somewhat hard to move around the house. So, I'd recommend doing this DVD just once a week if you're going to all of it at one time. And remember, this is almost TWO HOURS worth of stuff. So, make sure you have the time and plenty of water.

4) She's with four other women; all who are a bit older with different both types. I don't like when she's alone. It makes her look too lonely. Plus I tend to observe that when she's with other people, she's happier. I like a more motivated, hyper, and encouraging Leslie.

***Cons***
1) There is no timer or mile bar at the bottom to help you keep progress.

2) The music was really weak. You can't really hear it all that well.

***Netural***
1) You may not feel so connected with the area she's in. The first mile setting was pretty cheesy and it was a bit bright. She's not really in a studio or room, but it looks like she's in some kind of outside hallway or breezeway. Again, if you're used to her more current workouts, this workout will make you feel like you went back in time like into the 90's at least.

2) When you're done with each workout, it will bring you back to the menu each time. So, if you're like me and tend to do the entire workout and just want it to keep going, you'll have to keep that remote nearby.

3) The DVD came with a stretch band and I'm not sure why becuase she had no exercises concentrated for that. If you're looking for a good stretch Resistance band workout, buy her 'Five Really Big Miles'. She has two miles dedicated to that. But on this DVD it encouraged us to boost your strength with it.

Having neck and back issues (bulging discs), I can not do high impact. I felt I got a good aerobic workout without hurting myself, and the use of 1-2 lb weights is good for my osteopenia.

All of Leslie's Walk videos use the same 4 basic steps so you don't have a complicated series of moves to learn and this really is low impact so just about anyone can do it. When I first tried the Leslie Sansone Walk Away the Pounds I weighed 350 pounds and was recovering from a stroke. I had to put a chair on either side of me (like a walker) and one behind me in case I fell but I was able to do a 2 mile walk. In 1 year I lost 80 pounds and today you can't tell I ever had a stroke.

1659425,5,B00005T33K,"After having my second baby I ordered these dvd's. The 1-mile walk was a GREAT way to get started after having let myself gain too much weight with no exercise in years. Leslie gives great tips throughout the video (you don't have to use weights or do a full motion) and she has a couple of the other people in the video doing modified versions of the routine all the way through.

The best thing about this set is that you can work UP. The one-mile is sufficiently challenging for those of us who were / are out of shape and the three mile walk is a fantastic cardio workout and is something you will be proud of accomplishing if you've been away from exercising for awhile. The moves Leslie uses will never leave you frustrated (unlike other routines like Tae Bo or Zumba or even regular cardio videos). This was important to me - I hate feeling frustrated during a workout, and frustration during a workout sometimes means that I stop working out altogether.

The ONLY negative about this set is Leslie's chattiness with the other people in the video (but do NOT let this deter you from buying the set!). The dialogue drives me crazy sometimes but to be fair, the chattiness didn't get on my nerves until I'd done the routines for quite awhile.",1330128000,2,1247,4.488986784140969

Also, I started Weight Watchers the same time I began the Leslie Sansone workouts.  As of February 1, 2012, I have lost 10 lbs.  I have to admit though, the workouts can be boring and repetitous, BUT you do see a difference IF you eat healthy and workout everyday.  Good thing about this video as well, you don't have to do sit-ups, no jumping, and no complicated steps.  And there are 4 videos in one disc.

There's nothing more frustrating than having to stop a workout to fast forward through chapters to go from the warm up to the work out to the cool down. Other reviewers have provided detailed descriptions of each workout, so I won't duplicate that.

1659453,5,B00005T33K,"It took me ages to decide which Leslie Sansone compilation to buy - I'm so glad I chose this one.  I already had Walk and Jog, but the other three in the collection make it still worthwhile. What I like is that two of the workouts are strength training (Power Mile and Walk Strong)  and two are more cardio (Walk Strong and Walk and Kick).  I like to combine two of the workouts together, like Walk and Jog with Walk Strong to get a 60 min workout with both strength training and cardio. segments.  Power Mile isn't terribly strenuous  and I think you're cooling down after about 13 minutes, so I tend to combine that one with another 3 mile walk on another DVD.  Note : there's another Walk Strong DVD which, judging by the video previews I've seen, uses the stretchie. This Walk Strong uses dumbbells.

Walk and Kick -for the  last year I was avidly doing kickboxing dvds - they are my favourite form of fitness. I particularly love Jeanette Jenkins, Kimberley Spreen, Turbo Jam and the 10 minute Solutions kickboxing workouts.  Towards the end of the year, I sustained a severe abdominal wall injury (totally unrelated to exercise) that required surgery and now kickboxing is definitely out.  So I have to avoid anything that even vaguely requires rotational movements like cross or hook punches or roundhouse kicks.  The kickboxing component of Walk and Kick is pretty gentle and it sure feels good to get back into some of those movements, albeit with major modifications.

At the moment I'm only able to do Leslie's walking dvds as anything else causes major pain. But her routines are effective and do get your heartrate up - I'm sure I'll still be doing Leslie dvds when things improve.",1303948800,3,1694,4.666666666666667

I've watched the DVD while she works out to it.  Leslie has a down home style and is easy to listen to.  She gives encouraging pep talk the whole time.

1659474,5,B00005T33K,"As a previous reviewer pointed out, this DVD is actually a set of four distinct tapes previously made and sold individually. It's kind of like ""The Best of Walk Away the Pounds"" the series. A Stretchie resistance band comes with the DVD but I am not sure why. There are two places where free weights are used (POWER MILE and WALK STRONG) but I used my weighted 2-lb weighted balls (similar to Leslie Sansone's Walk-Away Weights) or a set of 5-lb dumbbells.

The first taped segment is POWER MILE which is a fast and powerful one mile walk. Leslie walks with two of her brisk walking exercisers and uses the weighted balls.

WALK STRONG is, I believe, the most important segment of the four and is the one I like the most. Early on Leslie identifies the ""four steps of all in home walking"" which she states is walking in place, side steps, kicks and knee lifts. She declares that if you can do these movements you can do any of the program as designed. Here she combines fast walking and weight training. She tells you that you can use 1-lb, 2-lbs, 3-lbs or no weights at all. She herself employs a set of 5 lb weights which she admits is for the advanced walker. This is an excellent segment where Leslie does such multimuscular exercises as bicep curls and lunges, tricep kickbacks and lunges, squats and upright rows, squats and tricep presses and squats and bicep curls. She does one phenomonal exercise where she combines squats, bicep curls and shoulder presses all at the same time. She insists that the tape is done briskly enough, however, to make sure you get the training effect. I agree with her that the addition of strength training really challenges the body. She tells you that ""you're going to continue to burn a lot of calories especially after strength training and walking together"" because you really have a metabolism boost that is superior. This segment, Leslie tells you at the end, is the equivalent of walking two miles.

The third segment is WALK & JOG which to me is the precursor of some of two of my favorite Leslie Sansone tapes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leslie-Sansone-Walk-Slim-Fast-and-Firm-4-Really-Big-Miles/dp/B0010V60XY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leslie Sansone Walk Slim: Fast and Firm 4 Really Big Miles</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leslie-Sansone-s-Walk-Slim-4-Fast-Miles-2-Disc-Set/dp/B000OYCMMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leslie Sansone's Walk Slim - 4 Fast Miles  (2-Disc Set)</a>&nbsp;although she is not yet calling the gentle jogging ""boosted walking"". There is interval training of sorts where speedwalking for three minutes alternates with gentle jogging for two minutes. Also she demonstrates (maybe for the first time) leg swings.

The final segment is WALK & KICK and here intervals of brisk walking alternate with kickboxing which I had not experienced before doing this tape. I really found this segment to be enjoyable.

This has to be the first of Leslie's segmented DVD's which I really, really like.  I don't generally favor a segmented DVD such as this one preferring to exercise with the SAME group of brisk walkers for a 45-minute plus session.

My only complaint is that the DVD comes in a cardboard sleeve and after just a few uses it started skipping.  However, lucky it only skips on one section and hasn't gotten worse and is still usuable.

I've been doing mostly the 2-mile walk for about 5 months now, 3 times a week, and haven't lost a pound because I never do when I exercise (only when I diet). BUT...no more cellulite on the hips. I was mainly trying to get a good aerobic workout, but surprise bonus - somehow my hips and thighs got smaller and turned from flab to muscle. And my endurance improved. The arms part of the workout is good, too, with the weights. I have been gradually incorporating more of the arms action than she does within the 2-mile. It's easy to add more without going to the 3-mile workout, which of course takes longer. A 2-mile, half-hour workout is easy to squeeze into the day. It's also great for improving overall energy level, as any aerobic exercise is. But the big advantage is no getting in the car and driving to the gym; you can do it any time you want. So, guess what? You actually do it. Go Leslie. I'm going to buy more of your videos. I guess you're not likely to change the name to ""Walk Away the Cellulite"" any time soon.

'Muscle Mile One' is your basic one mile. '30 Minute Walk' (also on '5-Day Fit Walk') is good. When I need a fairly gentle workout and want a cast of very real people (not Leslie's fellow instructors or a group of the familiar faces) 'Walk Diet One Mile' suffices (no production value here). 'Walk Strong Express' is my fave on this DVD. Challenging and makes for a nice change with the interval training (and the participants using different kinds of weights).

In search of variety and options beyond the basic four LS moves I was interested in 'You Can Do Pilates.' I'm not familiar with her solo offering by the same name, which has a slightly longer run time, so it may afford more in the way of instruction. Were it not for the fact I have some knowledge of Pilates this would be way too confusing. It lacks detailed breathing and body positioning cues, and, in my opinion, presumes the participant has an intermediate skill level.(As a Boomer, my Pilates faves are Carol Argo's 'Anti-Aging Method' and Maggie Rhoades' 'Pilates Complete for Inflexible People.')

As with some of the other 'collections' the music of these older workouts....upon which I rely to keep me moving and in sync with the workout...is weak much of the time. The sound quality from one workout to another lacks consistency, as well. Given my other LS workout options, this one is rarely in the rotation.",1272067200,3,1603,4.800724637681159

The do the one mile with (light) weights when I'm in a time crunch and on the days a want a stronger boost and have the time I add the 2 miles with medium weights to that and I love that. If you're in your 20's or early 30's and are in good shape, this will probably bore you, but I feel this is good for over 40 and slightly overweight. My only wish is that Leslie would put out a video with music from the 70's. I know soooo many people that would love that. All of my girlfriends, even those in their 30's said they would love that. There is something about the disco beats that will get you moving. That's why that guy that has people sweating and there is ""oldies"" music is so successful with the video.

I'm a busy mom, so on days that I'm having a hard time fitting in a workout, I do the one mile.  When I have more time, I do 2 or 3 miles.

1659632,5,B00005T33K,"Leslie,

Several years ago our rural public library contacted you and requested permission to use your videos in a fitness program at the library.  You generously granted permission and I wanted to let you know that we are still going strong.  I recently added your two newest DVD's, Walk-away the Pounds Fat Burning Miles and Walk away the Pounds - Burning your Belly Flat to our growing collection.  Occasionally we stray from your videos to try a bit of yoga or pilates, but we always come back to Walk away the Pounds.  As a group of active, mature women, we find your upbeat nature and encouraging tone infectious. Walk away the Pounds just works for us!  I'd like to be able to say that we are all as slim as the women in your videos, but while we are not, every one of us would credit these work outs with increased energy, better strength and stamina, and an improved posture and body image.

Do I have a critique? Fat Burning Miles has three separate miles with a slow down and stretch at the end.  You can choose to do 1, 2 or 3 miles, but then have to forward to the end for the cooldown.  This works best for those choosing to do all three miles, as some of us might drop out after one or two.
Burning your Belly Flat is a great addition to your collection.  I like the increased focus on giving a bit of anatomical information and incorporating moves which engage the abdominals.
Thank you, again, Leslie.  For a small, rural community whose main access to exercise is outdoor activities, this set of DVD's is a blessing to those of us who want to keep moving rain or shine.",1258416000,16,1587,4.382252559726963

1659688,5,B00005T33K,"I really love this workout. I have a large collection of Leslie's most recent dvds (I have all but one of the walk at home series) and this is my first WATP purchase.

I liked seeing the younger Lynn, Mary, and Jo. They were so pretty back then and they all still look pretty and healthy now-- check out the latest dvd, ""The Big Burn- 2 miles"" work out; all three cast members are there. ANd of course, Leslie looks fabulous. I don't know how old she was back then, but I hope I will look svelte like Leslie when I become that age.

I am in my early 20's and I fractured my foot and my knees start to ache for days if I try to do more intense cardio and strength training work outs. I prefer Leslie's work outs with out boosted walking options ( like this dvd) over the ones that do have it. I feel a little bad if I don't do the boosted walking in the other work outs because I feel like I haven't really did a mile. This work out is definitely safe and easy on my knees and fractured foot.

Parts of her miles have faster walking moments like in ""Leslie Sansone's 5 Mile Fat Burning Walk"" dvd. But unlike the ""Fat Burning Walk"" dvd, ""WATP for ABS"" start with a slow and steady warm up and I feel like I could walk more smoothly and effectively. ""Leslie's Fast & Firm: 4 Really Big Miles"" have a warm up too but it is pretty fast for a warm up, in my opinion, and even Leslie mentioned that the warm up is ""a little peppy.""

I use 1.5 or 2 lb hand weights because I don't have the walking belt. I think the hand weights do just fine and are a good substitute to the walking belt. The weights make my ab muscles to adjust and stabilize themselves so it helps with tightening up the ab muscles. The work outs do a lot arm movements with the belt while walking so you are forced to use your core automatically. If you don't have the walking belt, make sure to remember to tuck in your tummy because the walking belt is said to do the tummy tucking for you.

I like to do the 3 mile work out twice if I have the time and I always work up a sweat. The 2 mile work out is fun too. I keep forgetting to time the 3 mile work out but I timed the 2-mile workout and it is 28 minutes of warm up and walking with the last 2 minutes of the 30 minute work out used for cool down.",1247356800,14,2266,3.960526315789474

Go Leslie!",1243814400,,415,4.073170731707317
1659691,4,B00005T33K,"In my opinion, these are the best DVDs for couch potatoes. I haven't worked out in years and it shows. I have close to 75lbs to lose before I am at a healthy weight. I have been doing these DVDs for a little over 2 weeks and am down 8lbs and 2 inches from my waistline already. I HAVE altered my eating as well but I know that working out has contributed a lot because usually I gain when I start eating less.

I have only done the 1 mile a couple of times, it doesn't seem to really get my heart rate up and going. If I was short on time and/or couldn't shower after working out, it would be great for just doing SOMETHING that day.

The 2 mile is very easy to do. It goes by quickly but makes me feel like I am really doing something because I'm breathing heavily and sweating during the workout. This is my usual workout because I have to fit it in during my baby's nap and still be able to shower before he gets up. Leslie is upbeat and fun during this workout, but it gets more annoying the more I do them, which anything you watched almost every day would. Once you get the hang of the moves you can turn the volume down and just do the steps with your own music.

I have done the 3 mile a few times and it really works me out. I am starting to alternate this with the 2 mile to get more of a workout. The only thing that I don't like about the 3 mile, and this is the reason that I'm leaving off a star, is that Leslie gets off beat and LOT in this, and forgets what directions she gave in one spot. It's confusing, and not being on beat makes the workout choppy. Also, she and her ""posse"" are super sugary, plugging the workouts over and over. It gets irritating because it's like they're trying to sell the workout even though you've already bought it. But like the 2 mile, once you get the steps you could just mute the TV and turn on the radio.

I would advise anyone looking to buy the weights to go along with these DVDs not to do it. They are just balls that you fill with water. I got some Wellness Gear 1 lb weighted balls and they've been great so far, better than the soup cans that I was using at first!

The bottom line is that yes, Leslie and her crew can get a bit irritating, but if you want an easy and effective workout, these really can't be beat.",1243296000,5,2273,4.008830022075055

I complain about not being able to lose weight even when watching what I eat, knowing full well that I must exercise to lose the extra 50 pounds I have packed on over the years.  I started the walk DVDs at a weight of 195, down to 190 after just using it a week, and incredibly I actually look forward to the walks!!  That is amazing in itself.  I can already tell the difference in how my clothes fit and that with the weight loss will keep me motivated.  Eventually, I think I will get to the point where I will still watch the DVD but put on my own music, but right now I need to feel like I'm really at the session with the other gals!  For a 52 year old woman who hasn't exercised in years, this works for me!  I would recommend it to others who, like me, have been yo-yo dieting and not exercising.  This is something that is finally working for me!!  It is more than just walking which is what makes it work, but yet you don't get lost with fancy foot work.  Good luck.

1659696,5,B00005T33K,"I ordered these DVDs several years ago and never used them. Recently I had a health scare that made me realize I needed to exercise. I started walking on the treadmill and developed plantar faciitis. I needed to keep exercising without making my foot worse and remembered the WATP DVDs. I started with the 1 mile walk which was pretty simple and best of all it didn't aggravate PF. The next day I used the 2 mile and did that every day for a week. Today I did the 3 mile walk. It was difficult but I made it through.

I like this program a lot. First of all I am really uncoordinated and so aerobics and jazzercize would be really hard. I didn't want to spend time learning new ""routines"". This program consists of 4 moves...even I can do these! I can exercise without worrying about weather and can do it anytime I want. I don't have the exercise balls, but I already had some 2# weights and I just use them and I would assume it works pretty much the same.

Leslie Sansone and her ""posse"" kind of get on my nerves but I can tolerate it as long as I am seeing progress...and I am. Once I have the routine down a little better I'll just mute her.

I have ordered the 5 Day Slim Down DVD and after I am comfortable with the 3 miles will move on to that one. All in all I think this is a really good program. I would recommend it.",1242000000,,1328,4.1

I have been using it for 3 weeks, 5 days a week and have yet to feel bored. Though there are 1, 2 and 3 mile routines, I just alternate between the 2 mile (about a 1/2 hr.) and 3 mile (about 45 min.)routines . The water weight balls are really nice to work with and give my arms a total workout while increasing the heartrate while walking...keeps life nicely simple. The walks are a combo of walking in place, side-steps, forward leg kicks, knee lifts, backward knee lifts and some variations on some of these to make them more intense. The pace starts out slower, picks up for a while and then slows down with a bit of stretching at the end. Some folks have mentioned having a hard time filling the water weight balls; I did also until I reread the directions and realized I had done it wrong. Filled as full as I could get them they weigh about 1.10 lbs. each. I am looking for more of her dvds to challenge me further and to keep in shape.

She doesn't always use the weighted balls; but she enjoys Leslie's easy going style--""...do what you are able to do at your own pace, just keep moving!""

Low-impact and unthreatening movements with an intelligent and energetic Leslie Sanson has become the thing I look forward to doing every day. Her ""mileage markers"" make me feel good, as if I've achieved something, which I have -- making it that far! The workout with the weights is terrific because you can can really feel the burn. Before my accident, I would have laughed at doing this video. Now, I think everyone should do it. It is so healthy, so easy, so energizing, and so much fun. It is far easier to walk with Leslie at home rather than putting on boots, packing up all of my workout gear, and crunching through slippery ice and freezing winds to the nearest health club.

If you are a beginner or are older or must start slowly due to an injury that requires low-impact workouts, then use this! I cannot recommend this enough. I have already been telling all of my friends that I am a WATP addict. Cannot wait until I've gotten healthy enough to move on to the next level!",1231459200,,1114,4.46078431372549

I tried the 2 mile workout for the first time today and worked up a sweat but didn't think it was as strenuous as the 2 mile workout on her ""Walk Away Your Waistline'.  Leslie and her workout partners were all pleasant and the music is good.  It was nice to see normal people working out for a change.

I tried to fill the balls and sprayed more water on the walls and myself than it was worth.  I never did get them full.  I used them, but thought they were hard to hold on to and threw them away after that.

I do feel that using light weights with these workouts is very beneficial, but would recommend using cans of soup or something purchased at the store.",1230854400,2,762,4.178082191780822

1659791,5,B00005T33K,"First, I must say, the price for the entire WATP system here on Amazon is WONDERFUL! I purchased this original system on VHS when it was released through an infomercial about eight years ago for much more. I had never heard of Leslie before purchasing WATP; however, I'm now a huge fan! I own over a dozen of her workouts now.

I think these videos have the best ""group of walkers"" over many of the other Walk at Home videos. It's a energetic, diverse group. One thing I love about Leslie's videos is that she has ""normal"" people walking with her: not everyone is a size 0 and perfectly toned. The majority of the women have curves and appear healthy, not stick thin. This factor is very encouraging to me.

I am a college student, but I have a difficult time with high impact exercise because of low arches in my feet. These videos get my heart rate up and make me sweat. I normally wear a heart rate monitor and burn 500-750 calories per workout with Leslie's videos. I've always seen awesome weight loss results. When I lost the majority of my weight several years ago, Leslie's videos were the key for me. I was amazed at how easy the choreography was, yet how great the results were. I weighed close to 165 pounds before using the WATP videos. I now range somewhere between 140-145 lbs.

I'm a regular exerciser, but when I feel I need to lose those few extra pounds that have crept up on me, Leslie's videos ALWAYS do the job. There may be no true ""quick fix"" to weight loss, but the WATP videos are certainly close, in my opinion!

--The Mile 1 video is very basic and extremely low impact. It introduces the four basic Walk at Home moves: walking (or marching) in place, kickbacks (hamstring curls), knee lifts, and side steps. The 1 Mile lasts approximately 20 minutes. It's great for beginners or for an extra ""evening exercise"" boost for the regular, intermediate exerciser. Sometimes I use a 1 mile workout later in the day, after I've done my longer workout in the morning. The mile 1 workout really doesn't make me work up a sweat but does get the edorphins flying.

--The Mile 2 video lasts approximately 30 minutes. Great for a more intense workout in a short amount of time. You'll definitely dig into fat burning with this workout.

--The Mile 3 workout is 45-50 minutes. It's a definitely a calorie burner. Leslie uses weights for a longer period in this video, as well, which really ups the intensity.

Each video features a ""mile meter"" at the bottom of the screen which indicates how far along you are in 1/2 mile increments.

If you choose to purchase the workout separately, there's no need to worry about purchasing the Walk Away Weighted Balls; you can simply use 1-3 pound hand weights.

This is a wonderful system for all ages and fitness stages. If you are new to Leslie's Walk at Home programs, this system is a great place to start!",1228348800,15,2863,4.511583011583012

1659822,5,B00005T33K,"I have been trying to lose weight ever since right after I got married. At my wedding I was a loose size eight, two months later I was a size ten, and I am absolutely positive that it was due to taking birth control pills. If anyone tells you birth control doesn't cause weight gain, WATCH OUT! They're just trying to sell you pills.

Anyway, I've been doing Tae-Bo for seven years with no results. Billy Blanks is cool and all, but the workout wasn't for me. I tried Leslie's program, and within two months I lost eleven pounds. Since then, I've been averaging a pound lost per week. I know this sounds slow, but most medical personnel say this speed is ideal for keeping weight off. The workout feels great, pure and simple, and you're not wiped out afterwards. It's also fun, because Leslie and the rest of the people on the DVD talk you through it and keep you motivated. I like how Leslie emphasises long lines and good posture, which is nice because it keeps the muscles from getting clumped-up looking.

The only problem I have is whenever I use the weights, my one-year-old wants to hold them. I try to placate him with a couple of tennis balls, which doesn't always work. My son is too smart for that, I think. :-)

Bottom line: there is no magic weight loss system. You just have to find what works for you, and Leslie's program has been effective for me. She's very positive and nice, too, which is a bonus.",1221696000,5,1418,4.404580152671755

Mine lose water after a while (I don't know if it evaporates or what), but I have a bad shoulder, and the weights do help me keep it moving and building it up.

1659825,5,B00005T33K,"I bought this DVD (the three workouts are on one disc) because I wanted to try out Leslie Sansone's in-home workouts to see if they might be suitable for my mother, who is in her fifties and not very active.

I worked my way through the 1-mile, 2-mile and 3-mile workouts using weights (I didn't use the weights that were included, since I had my own)and I found the 1- and 2-mile workouts to be good, gentle workouts for someone who is still healthy, even if she is not very active (I'm talking about myself here). They raised my heart rate, and helped me to raise a good sweat, but they weren't so difficult that I couldn't complete the workout, or that I felt terrible afterwards.

The 3-mile workout is definitely a little more strenuous, but you can work your way up to it, do it without the weights first, and/or modifty your movements so that they aren't as vigorous. The movements in these workouts aren't difficult, and the level of activity is, I think, attainable for almost everyone.

That said, I am not sure that the 3-mile workout, with weights, is entirely suitable for my mother, just because she has never been the vigorous exercise/sweat a lot kind of person. I'm going to see if Leslie Sansone has anything specifically geared toward less active individuals.",1221091200,,1278,4.646017699115045

The DVD offers a 15-minute one mile walk which is suggested if you don't have the time for a longer work out. The two mile walk is just like the one mile, but it is longer and more intense because you use the weights for a longer period. We have not yet attempted the 3-mile walk. We will build up to it.

Guys, you can do this workout, too.  There is a man in the back row, with snow on the roof, and he looks very good. I'm no spring chicken, so if I can do this workout, anyone can.

1659887,5,B00005T33K,"I bought the Complete Workout DVD system of Walk Away the Pounds with weighted balls. I found an old exercise tape of the 2 mile walk in a thrift store and bought it to try it. I was amazed and I loved it. The workout is great and easy to follow! I hate to exercise and even walking was nasty because I live out in the country and walked on dusty roads. Really bad on allergies! This is the only workout that I found I would really do and keep at it. It's easy for us non exercise people. I get bored easily but this workout keeps me going like going to Curves did. It's less expensive and I don't have to burn gas to get there.
  My daughter got one at the same time and she loves it too. She is an exercise person!  She says it's a great workout. She's does the 2 mile regularly and the 3 mile once a week. She only has time for that much or she would do more. I am still on the 1 mile, but it's great for a get up and go for us non exercise people. I'm about ready to go on to the 2 mile walk. Yea me! I can't believe I'm sticking with this. I'm a 57 year old grandma and my daughter is 30 and active.
  The weighted balls are hard to fill and one of mine is larger than the other and slushes around but that's Ok. If you can't handle that get some dumbells.",1208476800,2,1261,3.8346153846153848

I have found her video accessible and yet challenging, especially as I have worked up to the 3 mile workout.

I like the fact that you don't have to be a dance major to do the workout. I also like that there are 3 different workouts on the one dvd which allows you to fit it into my day depending on the time that I have available.

One of my co-workers started joining me and she is getting her own copy now for at home.",1207958400,,652,4.0625
1659899,4,B00005T33K,"The dvd with this product is great even for a begin-again exerciser like me. It has several options for the length of walk desired and the walk can be done with just a few feet of space available.
The weight balls included with the dvd are a joke. The user is suppose to fill them with water to inflate them. Much easier said than done. I am usually pretty good at following directions and putting things together. I've even built furniture and sewn curtains and clothing but I couldn't get passed step one with those things.
The good news is that you don't really need them to do the workout. You can either skip the weights altogether or buy a set of light hand held weights to use.
In my opinion they should just sell the dvd without the added ""bonus"" of the weight balls.",1207612800,,775,4.3517241379310345

My husband and 13 year old twins do the DVD with me and we had to buy more weights at almost $[...] a pair so I think the weighted balls that came with the DVD are a great deal.  They work really well for me.  Also, I don't know why someone is complaining about the little sleeve the DVD came in.  Who cares if they get a plastic case or not?  It just makes DVD's cost more and takes up more room on the shelf.  I think this is a great product and we all love doing the workouts.

The weights do kind of suck, I filled them up with some difficulty and they work OK but I've been looking around my house for my regular 2 lb weights because I would rather use those. I really like this system. I have only had the DVD a little over a week and my favorite now is the 2 mile. I've already done the 3 mile once, it is definitely tough but I think if I get really good at the 2 mile I will not have problems with the 3 mile. The 1 mile workout is definitely an introduction. It is good too if you are really crunched for time on a particular day. So far I'm loving this and I plan on getting another video from her soon.",1205712000,2,727,3.9523809523809526

I have other Leslie Sansone videos but I don't enjoy them as much as the three workouts in this set.

Despite the poor weights, the workout is really good. There are a lot of options for workouts on this DVD. You can choose a quick 1 mile, intense 2 mile and and even more intense 3 mile. Then, you can play all three together for 6 miles. I have combined various workouts to get more mileage in. I am a little bit of a beginner, but I think that intermediate and maybe even more advance exercisers can get a lot out of this DVD. I got it for about 13 bucks, so even if I didn't get the weights with it, I think it is worth the purchase.",1200441600,11,747,3.888888888888889

After about half an hour of wrestling with them and my faucet, not to mention soaking myself and my kitchen counter, I managed to get one ball filled up to the 2-lb. capacity, but have given up on the other one (can only get it filled to maybe 1 1/2 lb.)

I've done the 1-mile, 2-mile, and the 3-mile, and I have to say that I enjoy them very much.  I like the way that Leslie keeps you motivated throughout each video.  She's very upbeat.  Yes, she is talkative, but I like that.  It's been said that you should be able to hold a conversation while working out, and Leslie provides you with a way to monitor yourself.  Just repeat the steps with her and this will tell you if you are slightly overdoing it.  I believe this set is good for any level of fitness.  Great for a beginner because the steps are so easy to learn.  Also, I like the ""stretchie"" band.  It's nice to get some toning into the workout as well.  This was my first experience with Leslie Sansone. I am very pleased with her workouts that I am purchasing more of them.  All I can is, I don't hesitate to exercise anymore.  In fact, I look forward to it.  Leslie doesn't make it seem like a workout.  The time goes by extremely fast.  You work up a good sweat.  I can't say enough about her videos.

Each segment uses weights which enhance and intensifies the walk.  The pace is good and challenges you as you use the weights.  She always has someone to modify the workout if you are a beginner.

The 1 mile is fairly simple but still a good way to get started. I did the mile 2 right after I completed the mile 1 session and I was feelin really good after that. I had gotten my heart rate up and I felt great. Today I did the 3 mile walk and let me tell you, it got me sweatin! By the end of the work out I felt like I had left the gym. I have a gym membership but this work out felt just as good if not better than when I drive all the way out to the gym and I didn't even have to leave my home. Leslie is great and very simple to follow yet, believe me your still getting your heart rate up and working hard. Ive done other work out videos where the moves were to hard to follow and just made me mad so I'd give up. I actully enjoy working up a sweat with this series. I highly recommend this work out if you are sick of the videos that are just to complicated. I also recommend this to people with limited mobility. My mother has back and leg problems and I know even she could do this. You won't be dissapointed with this series.

I can do it, I can see the results, and for the first time ever I look forward to exercise.  The system is simple, easy to follow and challenging enough if you are not athletic kind of person.  You don't have to be a dancer or super fit to start.  A lot of reviewers comment on the music and the chatter, most of those comments are accurate, however, I normally do my routine very early in the morning, before my wife and kid are up, so I keep the volume down to where I can barely hear a thing, so that's not an issue for me.  So, if you are looking for a way to start doing some kind of exercise this is the place to start.  You will be able to do it, stick with it and reap the benefits.  It also will give you the confidence to do other things.  My suggestion, get a pedometer, use the dvd daily and get walking throughout the day.

Leslie Sansone is upbeat and encouraging, and her entourage seem happy and excited.  She uses small ball weights in the video, but I use small dumbbells and they work just fine.  There is a gradual warm up period in all the walks, and for each walk she re-introduces each of the four steps you'll be doing.  After the first few times you've done the video, you probably don't need to listen anymore and can just watch for them to change their activities.

You couldn't ask for anything more in a workout.  I have to do low impact aerobics because I have a herniated disk in my back and sudden movements can be dangerous for me.

I've tried so many diet and exercise programs, but this one is the first that has really shown results and it's something I can stick with. It's now part of my daily routine. Of course, you have to watch your diet too, but the program has been so successful for me that it has given me a reason to stick to a healthy diet as well. I like having 3 choices of routines too, since some days are more hectic than others and I don't always feel like doing the 2 or 3 mile programs.

I've gotten back on track and have started doing them again, and after about two weeks, my stomach is flatter, my thighs are slimming down, my arms don't jiggle quite as much.  The best part is that the tapes are just easy to do and they are not at all intimidating.  I have done some other tapes and you just feel discouraged and nervous because they go too fast and you are wondering if you are doing the moves right, rather than getting any real workout.  Leslie has a nice mix of older, younger, and slightly overweight folks in the video as well, so you know if a 72 year old man can do this workout, anyone 71 years and younger should be able to handle it!  I also like that Leslie does the whole walk with you, she doesn't do two or three steps then walk around and point to other people (hello, Denise Austin)instead of working out. The on screen 1/2 mile, 1 mile markers are great. It is true that if you do these tapes at least five days a week, you will lose weight, even if you are not following a strict diet.

It just seemed like this dvd was thrown together.  The banter between the exercisers was awful and distracting.  The music wasn't loud enough and Leslie looked horrible.

But don't be fooled - you still get a terrific workout.  It's also wonderful to have the choice of 1, 2 or 3 miles.  I love my set.",1152835200,,398,3.925

1660022,5,B00005T33K,"I've purchased many items from Amazon, but this is my first review.  This DVD has been wonderful for me!  I'm 48 and fairly active, but had gained a lot of weight over the last 4 years.  I've never done aerobic workouts because I am completely uncoordinated when it comes to performing organized aerobic or dance step sequences.  I truly just can't do it and I'm sure there are others like me.  But I can do this aerobic workout & I actually like it!  The steps are basic & easy to learn and instead of changing steps every few repeats, you continue to repeat the same moves for minutes at a time in this workout.  May be boring for the talented movers, but perfect for those of us who can't do any fancy footwork.  And it's a good workout that gets your heartrate up.  I've lost about 15 pounds over the 2 months I've been doing these workouts and I never do more than 2 miles at a time, 5 times a week.  And I have not been dieting!  I reduced my fat intake somewhat by going to lite mayo & margarine, but that's all.  I highly recommend this DVD for beginning & intermediate exercisers.",1150588800,11,1089,4.284313725490196
1660023,5,B00005T33K,"First off if you get bored with repetative movement this is not the workout for you.  I love to walk and use the treadmill but this takes walking to a whole new level.  By using just four basic movements and adding arms and direction the three mile walk goes by very quickly and I definatly work up a sweat.

I also appreciate the fact that if I am short on time I can just choose the one or two mile walk for a much quicker workout.  Leslie uses 2 pound water weights which you can purchase for $9.95 with a coupon inside the dvd, I just use my 3 pound weights and find them to work great.  I like the fact that after doing this workout my muscles are a little sore each day, not like with some other workouts that make you so sore you have to skip doing it for two days.

All in all I think this program works great, keeps my attention focused, and did I mention I lost 3.5lbs the first week I started doing it, even though I had been walking briskly 3-4 miles daily for 4 weeks previous.  (it really mixes things up).  So my advice to you is order it and use it!!!",1147219200,37,1067,4.023696682464455

I am a Diabetes Educator so I even recommend these tapes to my clients to help them improve their blood sugar control.  Leslie's program is fabulous!",1144972800,5,462,4.146067415730337

I pick the workout based on how much time I have. The 1 mile workout takes 15 minutes, 2 mile takes 30 minutes and the 3 mile takes 45 minutes.

I have worn a heart rate monitor and the best workout is the 3 mile. Doing the workout with 2 pound weight gets the heart rate up.

If you want a heavy duty workout, this is not the DVD for you. Go to the gym!!! I use this DVD to break up my day. I work at home on the computer all day and even the 1 mile 3 separate times throughout the day has it's benefits. Enjoy.....",1142899200,10,659,3.6666666666666665

1660027,5,B00005T33K,"This collection of three different walking workouts has helped me lose 25 pounds so far!  Granted, it's taken me about 5 months to do it, and I've been eating healthier foods, but I credit a lot of my success to these workouts!  I'm a former dancer and long distance runner who gained a lot of weight when I went away to college, and I had been searching for a DVD that I felt really comfortable with that gave me a good workout.  This is fabulous - the 1 mile is great for starting out, and after 5 months has become a great warm-up and way to start the day.  The two mile is invigorating and gets you breathing pretty hard - I think it's a good aerobic workout.  The three mile is still challenging, because it keeps you at a very brisk pace, keeping your heart rate up for quite a while.

I've seen a significant difference in my strength, thanks to the use of weights (despite their low weight of 2-3 pounds, they're effective) and the different leg movements used - side steps, kicks, knee lifts.  My legs are stronger and thinner - especially my thighs!!!  That's reason enough to do this workout!

As a former dancer, I'm pretty coordinated.  My mom, however, is not, and she is definitely able to do these workouts with no problem - she loves them because they don't have complex choreography (she finds the steps in Denise Austin's cardio workouts too confusing, so that's a good way to measure the difficulty of these steps).

I recommend this three-in-one DVD with all my heart - Leslie's personality is inspiring without being annoying, and it has helped me get close to my goal, which is my pre-college weight, and I'm sure that I'll get there soon if I keep doing this - only 10 more pounds to go!!!!",1141084800,26,1714,4.444089456869009
1660048,5,B00005T33K,"I have used Leslie's videotapes once in a while with my sister, who adores Leslie. After my 30th birthday, I decided that it was time for me to get serious and get the DVD for myself. Since the first of the year, I have exercised to this DVD six times a week. It allows for those days when I don't really have a lot of time I just do the 2 mile and when I'm feeling a little more energetic and have more time, I'd do the 3 mile. I no longer have to squueeeeze into my jeans and I feel great.",1140739200,10,491,3.823529411764706
1660049,5,B00005T33K,"I bought this same set of three workouts in a 2-DVD pack (also available on Amazon) for about the same price as the 3-in-1 DVD shown here.  I'm guessing this DVD is the better buy, since the 2-pack costs about the same but is twice the size (and size counts when you don't have a lot of room to store DVDs).  It can be hard to tell these workouts apart, so I thought I'd mention it.

But on to the workouts: I LOVE them!

I'm not a coordinated person.  My best friend used to do Tae Bo DVDs religiously, and occasionally she could con me into doing them with her.  My take on Tae Bo was usually flailing my arms and legs all over and bumping into my friend. (That's dangerous.)  But I can do Leslie's workouts!  They're really, really easy to follow.  Although Leslie sometimes does make mistakes (e.g.: she says ""We're going to do knee-lifts!"" and then starts doing kickbacks), she's very good about telling you ahead of time which movement you will be doing next, and that helps you to keep up.

It's totally silly, but I do love the people who walk behind Leslie during the workouts.  They're all obviously in great shape, and they don't break even the tiniest of sweats, but the whole time they say things like ""WHOO! I think I'm going to make it through this second mile!"" or ""I'm going to put my weights down and conserve energy so I can make it to the end!""  It makes you feel better about how well you are doing.  But, really, deep inside, you know that they are full of it.  I mean, they're not even sweating!  So, for me, the workouts are more enjoyable because I keep laughing.

Aside from walking in place, there are four basic movements in each workout: knee-lifts, side-steps, kick-backs, and simple kicks.  Leslie changes each one a little with arm movements or forward and backward steps.  So you might do knee-lifts and move your arms in an arc through the air, or you might do knee-lifts while stepping forward.  Unless you have a serious limit to your mobility, you can probably do these steps, even if it means that you have to go more slowly or use modified movements.  During each workout Beth--one of the walkers--shows how to do modified versions of each movement.

During each workout, there is a segment that involves using weights.  YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE WEIGHTS!  You will get a workout without them.  You could even use something else, like two blocks of cheese or something.  Don't wait to buy this DVD because you don't have weights!  The movements are the same whether you have weights or not.

Leslie's ""Walk-Away Weights"" are essentially 2-lb balls, and you carry one in each hand.  Any other light weight will work, but you want to make sure that it's easy to hold onto and won't break your foot if you drop it.  I have four 1-lb wrist weights that I got in packs of two from a dollar store. I wear two of them on each hand (not on each wrist, or my hands would turn blue).

I only like to buy exercise and yoga DVDs if they have more than one workout, because sometimes you don't have time or energy for longer programs, and sometimes you want a really good, extended workout.  This DVD is perfect for that, because of the three different lengths.  The one-mile program is 18 minutes; the two-mile program is a half-hour; and the three-mile program is 45 minutes.  Great!  Having 3 workouts also helps to prevent getting sick of watching the same thing over and over.

There are only a few drawbacks to this DVD, and those won't be considerations for everyone.
1) The exercises in this DVD won't be challenging to athletes and/or people who regularly use advanced cardio exercise videos or programs.
2) People who need constant variety probably won't be able to use this DVD for very long, because there are only four movements (even if there are a lot of variations).
3) If you have a lot of knee, hip, or joint pain, this style of exercise could be painful.
4) In at least one workout, Leslie does talk about how God made human beings to move, and God is smart, and so on, and that will be a turn-off for some people (although I'm not making any judgments either way).
5) If you live upstairs in an apartment, your downstairs neighbors might slowly begin to hate you.

All-in-all, I say ""Buy it!""",1140220800,166,4235,4.46875

This is a good workout because it is low impact, very easy, and you don't have to use the weights. Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, Leslie is very upbeat and friendly. The people exercising with her are all ages and walks of life. There is one man, too. Also, a chart comes up every so often to tell you how far you have walked. The miles start right away, and there is a small cool down after you finish. The only complaint I would have is that the music kinda sucks!

I don't think this workout is challenging enough for the avid excerciser, it's more for someone who is just starting a workout program. I skipped right to the three mile walk and it was pleasantly challenging, but found that I needed to increase the intensity in order to feel like I've really worked. I like  adding ankle weights. The 2-mile is a good, enjoyable walk though not terribly challenging.  The 1-mile is great for when I don't have a lot of time, but want to get in some aerobic exercise during the day.  Leslie is somewhat annoying---ok, VERY annoying, with all her chattering and laughing at her own jokes, so I turn the volume all the way down and put on my own music.  My favorite thing about these videos is that I don't have to be a contortionist or in any way coordinated to feel like I've gotten a decent workout, like I felt with pilates and yoga.
These workout tapes are a great way to work off daily stress, when I don't have a lot of time to spend taking care of myself.

Leslie's program does not require a lot of room to complete and she is very motivating without being ""overkill."" I also love the fact that she has different types of people doing the workout (older and younger, great shape and not so great shape).
The only negative I really have is that I find the weights that are supplied to be a bit annoying. I didn't realize you have to fill them with water, which takes a LONG time. I thought they were going to be already filled. I use my regular two pound hand-weights with the program and they are just fine.

1660116,5,B00005T33K,"I am 82 years old and have been using these videos since April, with unexpectedly great results. I live in a retirement community where they provide exercises for us, but I wanted something more vigorous that would tone me up and help me lose weight. I appreciate being able to walk without going outside in the heat  or cold and I have lost about 10 lbs since April. Better than that, I have lost inches in my waist and abdomen. My friends tell me that I look much thinner, though I haven't lost that many pounds. I think it is the fact that my body is better proportioned (if that is a valid description!). I certainly feel much stronger, my balance is far better, and I have much more energy.
I heartily recommend these tapes to any older person who, with their doctor's approval, is willing to work up a sweat every day and see results.
I started the 1 mile walk in April, soon graduated to the 2 mile, which I did daily for 2 months, and am now going on to the 3 mile. I have the version of the tapes using the Stretchie Band, and notice a great improvement in my upper body strength, though in my case that is still nothing spectacular!
Recently I was on a visit to friends who have no TV, so I recorded the sound from the video on audio tape and continued to do my walk daily. The beat of the music is very helpful, and Leslie is so encouraging and supportive. A really great exercise video, and I have tried more than a few..",1059177600,30,1433,4.2299270072992705

1660157,5,B00005T33K,"Leslie is the ""Queen of In-Home Walking."" This is different than walking on a treadmill, but seems equally effective. You can also walk any day of the year, rain or shine, day or night. There are no limits.

Leslie travels all over the world promoting fitness and holds six certificates from the American College of Sports Medicine. She also owns Club Fitness and makes appearances on the QVC Home Shopping Channel.

After trying a few of Leslie Sansone's workouts, this has been my favorite workout set. I like the way you can choose between walking 1, 2 or 3 miles. If you start with the 1 mile walk, you know you can do the second and then the third video.

The Three Videos:

Get Up and Get Started - 1 Mile. This video shows you all the basics for a brisk walk. You start slow and work up to a nice pace, then there is a cool-down and stretch.

High Calorie Burn - 2 Miles. You will be so proud of yourself when you make it to the second mile. This workout has a new level of intensity to incinerate those calories. There is a warm-up and cool-down section. This workout helps you create a smaller, tighter waistline, builds strong muscles and bones, intensifies weight loss and works the legs, chest, back and arms. (30 minutes)

Super Fat Burning - 3 Mile. I loved this workout. It took me to new places because after this workout, I really saw some good results in the stomach area. I had to keep looking in the mirror to make sure it was true. This workout firms the upper and lower body, improves coordination and balance and boosts cardio strength. (47 minutes)

Since I'm not the queen of coordination, these workouts are nice and easy although let me tell you, the third video is going to really work you out! If you can stand in one place and move forward, back and put your arms up and down, you can do this! Therefore, this is really for anyone!

I highly recommend this set to anyone starting a new workout program or for anyone who just wants to have a little fun with their workouts. You just become one of the group and Leslie creates a very friendly, accepting environment.

The use of weights really takes these videos to a new level.

At first I thought Leslie was just a little ball of energy and her happiness level was pretty intense. But the more I did the videos the more I realized how good it made me feel to be in the presence of some positive energy, plus it gave me an added boost of ""I can do this."" The music also just keeps you moving!

If you have a 5 x 7 space anywhere near a TV, these are perfect. You don't need a lot of room like many aerobic videos require.
Once you get used to the two and three mile workouts, you can pass along the one mile to a friend and get them interested in workout out too. I just send the one-mile workout to my aunt.

After using these tapes, I lost two pounds in the last week and my husband thought I lost 10. Thank you Leslie! These workouts really do tighten and tone you all over.

Workouts that add a smiley burst of energy to your day. If you are on your couch, you better be looking out for Leslie Sansone cause she is going to ""come over and get you"" off that couch! At least that is what she says in the video! ;)

1660158,5,B00005T33K,"I learned about these tapes at a Weight Watchers meeting.  A woman who had lost over 100 lbs recommended them.  I thought that if she could do it, so could I!
I have been using these tapes for 4 weeks now.  I can already see a difference in my arms, calves, and thighs.  I skipped the one mile tape and started with the two mile.  It is VERY easy to follow.  I am unco-ordinated and hate excersize videos where the routines are so complicated I feel like I get nothing out of them (by the time I get the step its onto another step).
There are four basic steps besides walking-all easy and simple. Leslie switches between the steps constantly so you are not getting bored doing one for too long.  She also adds various arm movements (easy) to keep your interest.  The weighted balls definitely add to the intensity of the workout.
Leslie has real people doing the excersizes with her.  She always has one person doing half movements so if you are not ready for a full extension, you can follow this person.  She also has one person who is not using weights, so if you choose to skip the weights you can follow that person.
The tapes are conversational and move right along.  I was very surprised by how fast the three mile goes by.  I was reluctant to move from the 2 mile to the 3 mile, but was glad I did.  I alternate the tapes with walking outside.
I highly recommend this workout series.  I hate to excerisize, but feel these tapes are something I will stick with.  The hardest part of this program is filling the weights with water.  However, you do this once and never again!

I have at least 10 workout videos at home...none of which I've used more than 5 times. I received these videos two weeks ago and I've been using them 5-6 times a week! I skipped over the 1-mile and am now using the 2-mile or 3-mile when I have more time. I'm not able to finish the 3-mile with the weights...but Leslie has one of her group members drop the weights just when I'm starting to burn out on them. Perfect!
I took step classes for two years while in college and never could get the moves down! This video only asks for 4 SIMPLE steps besides walking: side steps, knee lifts, kicks, and back-kicks.
Some people have complained about the trouble they had filling the weighted balls with water. I have a tip...make sure the opening is completely covered with running water. Then, slowly pull apart the sides of the ball. The suction will pull in the water!",1056585600,12,1139,4.3023255813953485

I really enjoy the 2 mile more than the 3 mile. I think it's more fun and challenging. I look forward to doing these workouts. There is no jumping around, who'd have thought that walking would get your heart pumping and the calories buring? Only a small amout of space is needed, and no complicated moves.

Finally got up to the 2 mile walk with weights every other day, and today, I actually did the 3 mile walk (without the weights).
The 3 mile walk tape is the walk your doctor told you about, fast paced 45 min. brisk walk.  Tomorrow I'll do the two mile walk with the weights, this progam is so customizable.
Between these tapes, and changing to a soy based vegetarian diet, I've been able to bring my insulin intake down 20 units a day (from 80 units to 60 units) - I'm very interested to find what will happen as the pounds start really walking away.
I wish Leslie would make a tape with just streching.  I love the real people in her crew too.  ::::::waving at Randy::::::  and there's even a woman who is close to my age.

What I truly love is the fact that I get better all over toning than I would just walking on a treadmill for 1,2,or 3 + miles because with this program, I use all of my major muscle groups.  It actually saves me time because at the gym, I usually spend the first 20 minutes on strength training before waiting in line to use the treadmill or bicycle.  With this program, I do it all at once! I love the weights.  They're perfect for sculpting.  I also love the fact that I can do this in the privacy of my bedroom, it doesn't take a large amount of space and the time it takes to complete whatever session I choose goes so fast!
It also gives me the option  to do a shorter program (1 mile session) when I just ""don't have time""!!
I was introduced to this by  my Mother-in-Law and I was skeptical because I used to use various aerobic videos at home and always got so bored with them. I've since introduced this program to my Mom and she also finds it wonderful!
I totally recommend this product!

I had  eight broken ribs that never healed. The ribs over lap and are diplaced so that  means I cant do sit ups for my abs. So I developed a what I thought was going to be a permanent blubber ring around my waist, but the walk away the pounds is helping me whittle it off. Also I couldn't do lateral raises with  nautilus equipment, but  with the stretch cords  on the belt I can raise my arms with ease and no discomfort. I use my walk a way the pounds everyday and have noticed abig differance in how I feel . Its hard getting older and with this I now can do it gracefully as planned .

My favorite is her 3 miler, but the others are good also. I do it every day, 7 days a week, it's said that anything done for 21 days becomes a habit, part of your daily duties so to speak. I'm so glad I made it through those first 21 days, thanks to Leslie's tape, I'm no longer in pain once I get into the exercise. My FMS and other syndromes have not gone away, but I can definitely tell the difference in the pain levels and fatigue. I'm still limited in many ways, but because of Leslie's tapes I feel like I'm making progress, and am grateful for the pain reduction, IF YOU ONLY KNEW....ask anyone with fibromyalgia. Leslie will be my exercise Guru as long as I can walk.",1039305600,25,1283,4.35
1660230,5,B00005T33K,This is an excellent set of video's for the folks that really have a hard time to do a good work out. I have done the 2 mile workout for about 7 weeks now and it is only 30 minutes of my time and a great workout. I walk 2 miles doing the video in 30 minutes verse 1 to 1 and half miles on a treadmill. Great workout for a beginner.,1036022400,6,331,3.611111111111111
1660241,5,B00005T33K,"I purchased the ""Walk Away the Pounds"" w/""Weighted Balls"" set about 10 months ago at the recommendation of my healthcare provider.  It was the best thing I could have done.
I use the tapes at least 4 days a week and so far have lost almost 70 pounds and have gone from a size 24/26 to a size 18. I have more energy and I feel sooo much better; not only physically, but emotionally. I do the 1 mile tapes when I am crunched for time. I usually do the 2 mile. I do 3 mile tape when I've skipped a day. When I'm feeling really energetic, I do the 1 mile and the 3 mile tapes.
The movements in these tapes are well thought out and easy to follow; not like many of the other fitness tapes I own.  I like that she tells/shows you what you are going to be doing before she does it; not after she starts the new step.
My kids, ages 8, 9, & 11, also enjoy walking along with Leslie.  They have used some of my other tapes such as Gospel Aerobics, Richard Simmon's Sweatin to the Oldies and Groovin in the House. Walk Away the Pounds is their favorite as well.
Leslie's 1, 2 & 3 mile tapes are wonderful.  The music is great. Her walking mates are energetic and really seem to be enjoying themselves.  They are appropriately dressed as well.
I would recommend this set of inhome walking videos to any and everyone.  In fact, I have.",1030752000,33,1322,4.124513618677042
1660242,5,B00005T33K,"I have done the 1 mile and 2 mile, and I think they are good workouts, really more like low impact aerobics than walking.  There are a variety of moves besides walking, and Leslie gets the arms involved with movements and weights.  Now if I could only do the 3 miler!!",1028332800,6,268,4.235294117647059
1660243,5,B00005T33K,I have the Walk away the pounds with Leslie Sansone which is very good. It's not hard and you do build a sweat with 2 and 3 mile tapes. Leslie is quite easy going and I personally like the gang. It gives the tape a personal flair. It's a great workout for days that you don't have much time to spend exercising. I give it a 5 star rating for the quality.,1024963200,9,354,3.9305555555555554
1660244,5,B00005T33K,"This really works! I am temporarily living in a very confined space, and yet I can exercise to the tapes every day, and get a good workout.  There is some poor editing, and I think Leslie should say more about correct breathing and target heart rate.  However, I really look forward to my tapes and get a sense of accomplishment from them that I could never get in a fitness class. The one mile tape takes less than 20 minutes and is a real mood booster on a busy and stressful day.",1023580800,9,482,4.228260869565218
1660245,5,B00005T33K,"I have tried every product out there with no success. I have the deluxe set with the sanded weights. I just started the program 3 days ago. I feel this is a workable program for me. I can do this early in the morning before work. It is easy to follow and the weights do make a difference. My arms are already feeling it. I know I will be a success with this product. I will keep you posted with my success. Thanks Leslie for making it possible for out of shape, middle aged ladies to get in better shape.",1023321600,10,504,4.05
1660246,5,B00005T33K,Take this article seriously this is an awesome collection the 1 mile is good if you don't think you can fit much more time in to walk during the day I was able to do the 2 mile the next day then the day after that I did the 3 mile wow it is INTENSE but worth every minute of the time you are spending doing it this is an excersize you won't dread it is fun and quick she is very good at instructing and she really knows what she is doing and talking about I know when I first got the set I saw the walk away weights I said to myself how strange. but NO they are great and very effictive they make a difference it is amazing how this walking workout affects all of your body you are toning everything. Please if you are serious about taking care of your body purchase these tapes I went to my local store and saw the video set and never heard of such thing I got the set and I am absolutly greatful and you will be too. Thank you Leslie,1021766400,21,935,3.875
1660247,5,B00005T33K,"I own the set that comes with four tapes--the tone-up, 1 mile, 2 mile, 3 mile and two weighted balls plus a diet plan and energizer pills. I started I wore a 18 almost 20 and over 200 pounds. If you are or have been this big or bigger you know you can't jump and put your legs over your head around like most videos want you to. This one is so simple if you can walk in your home, I promise this will make a huge difference in the way you look and feel even if you only do the 1 mile.  Leslie makes it fun and reminds you do what YOU can and the biggest thing is just stay moving. I've lost 25 lbs and into a loose 16. I had lots have fat and lots more to go. But I know I'll get there with these videos.  I have not used her diet plan nor the pills.  But I do eat a little better but we all know that we don't want to eat junk food after we just had to work out, Right?  I hope that anyone with a weight problem gets these tapes.  There are wonderful. Best of luck I know it's hard but worth every drop of sweat.",1021593600,25,1013,3.7149532710280373
1660248,5,B00005T33K,"I love walking and I love aerobics - Walking Away the Pounds combines these two things perfectly for me!  It is actually a much more intense workout than I was expecting because of the weights and arm work.  I am improving my muscular tone in both my upper and lower body, and I also feel as though my posture has improved.  It's just a lot of fun, and the workouts go sooo fast - even the three-miler.  Now I have no excuse not to walk in inclement weather or during the short days of winter.",1017878400,5,493,4.157894736842105
1660249,2,B00005T33K,"During the just walking segments the participants have no arm movements - just hanging arms, and lots of casual chatting, so that kind of annoys me.  Also the frequent mentions of how wonderful the balls are and benefits of walking make it seem like I'm working out to an infomercial.  I just bought her variety pack set (from Collage) and so far just tried the Jog Walk video from that, and I really REALY like it! (hint) It also comes with Jog Kick, and Jog Yoga (these I haven't tried yet)",1015286400,4,492,4.395604395604396
