1175928,5,6304744536,"Shaolin and Wu Tang is truly a classic of the kungfu genre, and a very well made film. I found this film to be slightly different from many other kungfu films because it seemed heavily influenced by wuxia films, or swordplay dramas, and the film generally flowed better and had better acting that most kungfu movies. The story was also very interesting, and the fight scenes were always part of the plot, they were not put in randomly as they are in some kungfu movies. The film was very well produced and directed (by Gordon Liu), which made the film interesting even for those who do not like the traditional style of kungfu movies.
The story of this film was good and contained many interesting points. Here is a simplified synopsis of the plot: Two friends (Gordon Liu & Adam Cheng) who are students of the Shaolin and Wu Tang (WuDang) kungfu styles, are turned against each other by the Manchurian villian (Wang Lung-Wei). The villian does this because he is threatened by the power of these styles of kungfu, and he wants both schools destroyed, so he turns the two rival schools against each other.
The choreography in this film stands out-- it is very fast and fluid, and the moves flow together and match perfectly. This film is one of Wang Lung-Wei's best, his kungfu in this film is very solid. Idy Chan was also very good, I have not seen her in any other films, but she certainly matches Gordon Liu and Adam Cheng is both acting and kungfu. I found the acting by all the stars in this film to better and more subtle than in their other films, and better than most films in the genre. Overall this film was very well made and has all the elements of a good film as well as a good kungfu film.",1042329600,,1704,4.429936305732484

I like the training part of the movie but that is all that is good about this movie.  I thought that there would be a great martial arts fight on the end but I was wrong. The movie end up like it got started, a secondary demonstration of martial arts.  Gordon Liu and Adam Cheng was never able to demonstrate their martial arts skill because in order for them to demonstrate their art they have to create another plot than what they have created.  I would not recomend this movie, it is a total lost of money.  Gordon Liu should stay away from directing and just stick on acting.",986342400,2,737,4.297101449275362

1175944,5,6304744536,"This in the bottom line. The story is long and rather boring. Almost identical to ""Martial Club"". But, it has one of the best Shaw Brothers opening credit scenes, this is the first film that was directed by Gordon Liu, and the fight scenes are excellent.
However, there are only two versions out there to date. One is full screen and English dubbed. The other is letterbox and in Mandarin with English option subtitles ( we are getting closer...) but the picture on both is at the bottom.
I rate my dvd's like this. First, is Dragon Dyanasty versions. The Most brilliant, non-blu-ray, out to date. Then we have others that are movie theatre quality, then, t.v. quality and finally a bootleg of a dvd.
Both are of this quality....Avoid until it is remastered.
This is my 4th favorite movie out of all the Shaw Brothers 850 movies. And it is also my 4th favorite Gordon Liu film.
But, I will not buy a 3rd copy until completely remastered. If you don't own it, wait.... its great, but, the picture is soooo bad, you will not appreciate it or watch it alot.

1175945,4,6304744536,A good old-school martial arts film which doesn't tread the tired and well-worn paths so many of these films did. Outstanding martial arts segments as well.,1325462400,,156,5.038461538461538
1175946,4,6304744536,"It is said that Wu-tang originated from Shaolin, that he who founded the Wu-tang discipline was first a student of Shaolin but was expelled for his overbearing pride. Since then, Wu-tang and Shaolin have endured a sustained and heated rivalry. In SHAOLIN VS. WU-TANG, it once more comes to a head, but this time orchestrated by a manipulative Manchu lord.

This film presents one of the most often used plot devices in martial arts cinema, that of someone seeking to unearth the secrets of one school's martial arts. Except that this Manchu prince is a really greedy mother. He yearns for the secret fighting techniques of TWO schools: The Chin Kang Fist of Shaolin! The eight-divine Sword of Wu-tang! He doesn't shy from applying unscrupulous methods.

Demonstrating that friendship can bridge traditional enmities, two young students, Hung Jun-kit from the Shaolin school (Gordon Liu) and Chao Fung-wu of the Wu-tang clan (Adam Cheng) have fostered a longstanding comradeship. But the B.F.F. status is put to the test when the Manchu prince works his machinations. An amicable chess match between the prince and Chao Fung-wu's Wu-tang sifu leads to the sifu's being poisoned with tainted wine, of which act the prince promptly accuses Shaolin. The prince doesn't neglect to ensure that the Shaolin faction also suffers a devastating loss, with Hung Jun-kit coming to blame Wu-tang.

The former friends are so incensed that they ascend to higher levels of mastery within their respective disciplines (which then gives us more of those classic training montages which would cripple a normal man). You can't help but think that part of their motivation has to do with a sneaky earlier sub-plot which had compelled each of them to divulge his school's secret fighting technique. Can Jun-kit and Fung-wu overcome old grudges to face their true enemy? Can they settle their dispute without fighting to the death in the Shaolin/Wu-tang tournament the vile prince had demanded?

SHAOLIN VS. WU-TANG rides on the strength of its fight scenes - which are freakin' dynamic. The prologue sequence, that of one defiant martial artist challenging a group of Shaolin monks, pretty much establishes the birth of Wu-tang. Gordon Liu, who also directs this film, doesn't hog the spotlight. He allows his co-star Adam Cheng to show off his Wu-tang goods. And, as we learn, although Cheng's sword skills are the sauce, he also throws down wicked good in the field of unarmed combat. I won't even go into what Gordon Liu brings to the table. I'm assuming you know how iconic this bald dude is.

I advise you to go with the flow, to not question the lapses in logic. I don't know why Chao Fung-wu would be imprisoned in an insane asylum for women, but it does give us a neat sequence in which Jun-kit, in order to spring him, teaches Shaolin kung fu to one of the mental patients. Having said that, there are many scenes in the asylum in which the lighting is so bad (and so absent) that I couldn't make out much of what 's going on. But it's probably more to do with the DVD's quality... which is wanting.

This DVD's running time is 87 minutes, although the movie itself lasts only 77 minutes, followed by ten minutes of deleted or expanded scenes. If you're a fan of the rap group, Wu-tang Clan, then there's the added thrill of hearing those bits of dialogue that they'd sampled in their debut album ""Enter the Wu Tang (36 Chambers).""",1315612800,,3418,4.834188034188034
1175947,3,6304744536,"Gordon Liu has another hit, this time the story is how the Wu Tang Clan came about from the Shaolin Kung Fu. I like how they keep the two Arts as friendly as possible and complimented each others styles. The plot was good I thought it would be killing each other styles but no each schools. Instead there was class and friendship and respect for each others art. The Bad guy wanted both to kill each other so he would be number one, but no the two arts, through a contest, became great friends and good respect for each others schools.

1175948,2,6304744536,"This movie is indeed awesome.  It seems that the company that made it recorded it from tv or something and then packaged it as a dvd.  there are no credits at the end and the movie literally ends and there is a bunch of static (like you would get at the end of a VHS).  The movie was supposed to be widescreen and it was fullscreen and becausae of this, you cant read any of the subtitles (not that i need them) and you cant take them away.  This company sucks and no one should buy this dvd from the company, look elsewhere to find a better quality video if you care about that sort of thing.

1175954,3,6304744536,"If you like movies like ""8 Diagram Pole Fighter"" and ""36 Chambers"" you are probably going to like this film. It is the story of two friends who fight using different Kung Fu techniques--one Shaolin, the other Wu-Tang Sword. I'll admit, I mainly wanted to know something about Wu-Tang because I like the rap group, and if that is why you're reading this, go for it. The movie is easily 88 minutes of fun, but don't expect the Gordon Liu of those other films. He's good (when isn't he) but the story lacks some of dynamics of those other films.

1175956,3,6304744536,"Now I finally know where all those old-school quotes from the first Wu-Tang Clan album came from, a film that was written/amalgamated from elements of other, superior Gordon Liu flicks.  There are some inevitable comparisons with ""Instructors of Death"" and ""The 36th Chamber of Shaolin"".  This one has lots of well-choreographed fights.  The opening credits are amazing.  Unfortunately, the rest of the film fails to outdo said credits.  That's a bummer, and in my opinion, should never happen.

Gordon Liu directed and plays a Shaolin student who is good friends with Adam Cheng, a Wu-Tang student.  Their masters are kind of snooty with one another, and talk about sparring, but never do it.  Some obligatory Manchu jerk (Johnny Wang) wants to learn the secrets of their styles, but the respective masters will not reveal them.  Angry, Mr. Wang poisons the Wu-Tang leader to blackmail him into giving him their manual.  When it doesn't work, Adam Cheng takes the fall for the master's death and goes to prison with a bunch of psychotic ladies who always bogart his share of the rice.  Gordon and his sister break him out.  Soon after, his sister is killed by the Manchus as the dudes from Wu-Tang are taking away Adam Cheng to punish him for the death of the master.  There are no Manchus at the death scene and Gordo assumes it was Wu-Tang who killed his sister.  Then Johnny Wang orders that the two schools have a competition in the hopes of further dividing them and learning their techniques.

This version from Xenon says ""Digitally Remastered"" but I'm a little skeptical.  Perhaps they lack the equipment that Celestial has.  The picture quality is not bad and more than watchable, but some of the night shots will have you squinting to see the action.  The movie is still pretty good and I would have to recommend it to old-schoolers.  Just because the story is silly and the fights never get better than the opening sequence doesn't mean the rest of the film ain't worth watching.  English dubbed only and full-screen.

1175957,4,6304744536,"Great movie !  I absolutely enjoyed the martial arts, especially by Gordon Liu and Adam Cheng.  The different styles were cool to watch of Gordon's Shaolin and Adam's Wu-Tang.  The ending fight scence is very cool, but I wish there was more!  I wanted to see an all-out battle, but I guess you can't always get what you want.  And the final ending was, ""what?"".. Oh well!

  The basic plot is that the local Ching overlord wants to learn both the Wu-Tang and Shaolin fighting styles.  Both Masters veto him, and thus he hatches a plot with his servant to pit the Wu Tang against the Shaolin.

  As has already been mentioned, the translation of the dialogue is horrendous!  The english dubbing does not match up with the english text at the bottom of the movie.  I was laughing at the various translations, that at times were so far off.  Come on guys, get it right at least!

  I was also disappointed about the lack of extras on the DVD.  Throw on at least a couple of trailers or something.

Also the picture is grainy and the sound is mono, i don't give a sh*t about that, you can see whats going on well enough, and i actually think the old looking picture suits the movie.

so all right, what i'll talk about is this DVD release (the only reason i'm rating the film 4 stars instead of its deserved 5). well, these xenon released of classic kung fu films tend to suck pretty bad in quality, and this one really isn't an exception. the dubbing is awful (but pretty hilarious), and for some reason there are both english and chinese imbedded subtitles at the bottom of the screen. the subtitles are white and hard to read at times, and a bit of the right and left edges of the frame were cropped in the video transfer so the subtitles often get cut off too. the english subtitles are also horribly translated in relation to the english dubbing... they rarely match up at all.
(some of my favorite translation errors... dubbing says: ""they really do hurt. they went right through me. i'm really in a lot of pain."" while subtitles say: ""the arrows make me feel uncomfortable."" ......... dubbing says: ""you'll be avenged!"" while subtitles say: ""we'll be enemies forever!"" ha ha ha)
