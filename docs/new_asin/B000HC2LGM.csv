2632641,5,B000HC2LGM,"This may sound silly, but the prime reason I am pre-ordering this is because of my all-time Favorite Wile E Coyote cartoon, Operation Rabbit.  Here he introduces himself as 'Genius' and later decides he is a super-genius as he and the TNT shed blow up.  Classic stuff!  Speaking of 'controversial' cartoons, I wish 'Hare Ribbin'(un-cut of course) would make it on the next volume, instead of seeing the edited version on TV where the dog just magically drops dead?  I mean come on, what's more traumatising?  The part that the dog shoots himself and dies, or the part that he just magically winds up dead by some unseen force?  Talk about scary!

Anyway, pre-ordering this, I like the lineup of Bugs Toons on this one.",1156464000,5,718,4.696
2632642,3,B000HC2LGM,"In this volume there are only two cartoons by Bob Clampett: ""Porky's Poor Fish""(1940) + ""The Sour Puss""(1940), and no cartoons by Tex Avery. I think I'll pass on this set because of a lack of material by my 2 favorite directors. Warner Bros. has done a hell of a job with the previous sets though, and I'll be looking forward to see which cartoons make it to Vol. 5. I'd also like Warner Bros. to gain some courage and stand by their claim that these sets are indeed ""for the adult collector"" and include some of the more controversial cartoons like ""Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs.""",1156291200,7,584,4.416666666666667
2632643,5,B000HC2LGM,"I know, we all have our favorite cartoons.  And it's easy to nit-pick on the selection of 'toons in each volume.  But, with the release of Vol. 4, there are still OVER 700 LOONEY TUNES that Warner Bros. can choose from.  I think it's imperative that we fans continue supporting each release, in order to continue the Golden Collection series.

Having said that, I would prefer that they stop giving each disc a single theme.  I love these classic cartoons, but even I will have trouble sitting through 15 Speedy Gonzales cartoons in a row.  Wouldn't it be more fun for viewers to mix it up a little?  Or better yet, take a cue from the Columbia House Video Library, and give each famous cartoon director his own disc.

OK, so I'm guilty of nit-picking, too.  Vol. 4 is another treasure trove for classic animation fans, with incredible bonus materials.  So come one, Looney Tunes fans!  Grab The Golden Collection Vol. 4 so we can assure that ""That's NOT all, folks!""",1155772800,136,967,4.5964912280701755
2632644,5,B000HC2LGM,"In terms of overall quality, how do you rate this collection of shorts in the Golden Collection - Volume 4? How does Volume 4 rate compared with Volumes 1, 2, 3 ?

  Let me be the first to whine about one of my missing favorites from the first four Volumes:  The Unruly Hare (1945):

  But all whining aside, I'll be pre-ordering Volume four just like I did the previous three volumes.",1155254400,2,394,4.347222222222222

2632655,5,B000HC2LGM,"Fantastic addition to my Looney Tunes collection !!! These are some of the great old Looney Tunes cartoons. Disc 1 has lots of great Bugs cartoons: Rabbit Hood, Operation: Rabbit with Wile E. Coyote, Southern Fried Rabbit, Mississippi Hare one of my FAV, and Knighty Knight Bugs. On Disc 2 you'll find lots of Daffy and Porky and all of Disc 2 cartoons are created by Frank Tashlin.  There's lots of great bonus material on these Golden Collection's of Looney Tunes. Disc 2 has some great Private Snafu cartoon shorts, there were cartoons created for the government during wartime and have never been show to public on most parts. Disc 3 is all Speedy Gonzales cartoons. I don't believe there is any other Looney Tunes DVD or DVD collection that has this much Speedy Gonzales. Speedy was a character creation by both Robert McKimson and Friz Freleng. There is a hour long documentary on Friz Freleng on Disc 3 bonus material. Considering how rare and controversial Speedy cartoons are these days I recommend this Vol 4 Golden Collection based solely on this great content of Speedy Gonzales. Disc 4 is called Kitty Korner and is another good collection of oldie cartoons. But the best part of Disc 4 is there is a bonus called From the Vault and it has a joke reel with Porky swearing on it called ""Porky's Breakdowns"" from 1939.

2632714,5,B000HC2LGM,"Most of the reviews spotlight the cartoons that are on here but going another direction I'm going to focus on a couple of the extra's.

The Golden Collection in my opinion is a fascinating series of DVD's spotlighting the Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies series of cartoons. I own all of the volumes that were released. One of the things that I liked about the series was the extra's. I think I've played and re-played and re-re-played several of those ""Behind The Tunes"" segments on all the Volumes. The history that's presented and the comments from those who were there or those who are part of today's cartoon world are captivating (at least I think so).

The critically maligned ""Bugs Bunny: Superstar"" documentary, from 1975, is broken into two parts on Disc 1 and Disc 2. I happen to like the documentary, if for the only reason, is that I love seeing the clips of the directors/animators from a point in time where they hadn't really experienced the fame and glory that was to come as younger people became more and more fascinated with the whole body of Warner Brothers cartoons. Of course, the Warner Brothers cartoons had been airing on TV since the early '60s, but even by 1975 the cartoons had become increasingly pushed as ""children's programming"" and weren't taken as serious works of art or entertainment and their weren't any lavish praise heaped upon the Warner cartoons and those who worked on them like their is today. Why was this documentary maligned by critics? Well, it has to do with some of the commentary made by a few of the participants who either took credit for things they shouldn't have or omitted credit where credit should've been given.

Orson Welles narrates the documentary.

Each cartoon director that went through the studio and had any considerable time-span has their 'followers' even today. There's the fans of the wild, zany cartoons epitomized in the works of Tex Avery, Bob Clampett, Norm McCabe, and Robert McKimson. Frank Tashlin's cartoons have a live-action flavor. I was not familiar with Tashlin's cartoons due to how they rarely, if ever, played on TV and so I learned quite a lot about him in this Volume...he has a disc all to himself. There are a few extra features displaying sketches made by Tashlin for children's books...with animation edited in. June Foray narrates the story of ""Little Chic's Wonderful Mother"" while Stan Freberg narrates ""Tony and Clarence"".

Later, after I purchased the previous release, Volume 3, I found out even more thanks to the documentary called Tish Tash: The Animated World of Frank Tashlin.

It should be pointed out that I didn't purchase these Golden Collections in numerical order.

Friz Freleng and Chuck Jones are the two directors from the studio that garner the most acclaim and attention. A lot of that has to do with their longevity with the studio but also because their cartoons were often aired on television the most for 3 decades. It should also be noted that Freleng's cartoons won the most Academy Awards for Warner Brothers, a total of 4: Tweetie Pie, Speedy Gonzales, Knighty Knight Bugs, and Birds Anonymous.

Friz Freleng gets spotlighted on a documentary called ""Friz on Film"". It's a wonderfully done salute to arguably the best director from the Golden Age of Warner Brothers Animation in terms of stats, accolades, and total body of work. Freleng directed just about all the Warner cartoon characters at some point or another with a large percentage of his work concerning Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety and Sylvester, Yosemite Sam, and Speedy Gonzales.

Speedy was created by Robert McKimson (who directed the character's debut and some later cartoons from the studio's final years) but Freleng directed the ones considered by historians to be the most popular. In this documentary, as well as in other extra features that elaborate on Freleng, the creation of Yosemite Sam is almost always discussed. His peers and colleagues routinely state that the character is a complete duplication of the real-life Friz Freleng. His daughter remarks that Friz had red hair in his younger days and that he had a temper and several animators affectionately recall Friz being impatient, fuming, pacing a lot, and anxious during the animation process.

Friz himself, in archive footage, laughs about his tyrannical reputation during the production of the cartoons but remarks that he obtained that reputation due to his perfectionism and insisting that the cartoons come across exactly as he envisioned. The character of Sam, by the way, was created as a replacement for Elmer Fudd.

Chuck Jones, in addition to his many contributions to Warner Brothers cartoons, did a lot of mostly seasonal animation projects and specials away from Warner Brothers from the early '60s through the early '70s that often play on cable television annually to this day and that's probably a big reason why his name is much more recognizable by those outside the audiences of Warner cartoons. He did critically acclaimed work for MGM. The crowning achievement away from Warner Brothers, in hindsight, would be his adaptation of ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"", a story from Dr. Seuss, that plays every year. Jones returned to Warner Brothers in the late '70s and remained a pivotal figure in keeping the public remembering the classic Warner Brothers characters as well as providing newer animation projects utilizing the classic characters.

Jones introduced the world to the Duck Season/Rabbit Season routine and changed the personality of Daffy from being a free-for-all, zany, looney character into a gigantic egomaniac forever jealous of the popularity enjoyed by Bugs Bunny. The fans who love this depiction have Chuck Jones to thank.

The funny thing is that this characterization of Daffy remained constant...being picked up by the other directors...and today Daffy is known as a greedy, vain, egotistical braggart. In his memorable role as Duck Dodgers, Daffy plays the part of the know-it-all hero scolding and blaming his associates for his own incompetence. This is not the Daffy that intrigued movie audiences of the '30s and '40s...but it's a comical stroke of genius all the same.

Jones directed three cartoons that are in the National Film Registry: Duck Amuck, One Froggy Evening, and What's Opera, Doc?. Ironically, those three cartoons didn't win any awards during their original releases, but decades of showings on television and the viewer response to those three in particular elevated them above the other cartoons. Three of his theatrical cartoons did win Academy Awards: For Scent-imental Reasons, So Much For So Little, and The Dot and the Line. Jones won an Honorary Academy Award in 1996 for career/lifetime achievement.

One of the things about these Golden Collections is that the work of the directors are on full display and you're able to enjoy the various styles and characterizations associated with specific animators and directors. Until these collections started being released it was next to impossible to see cartoons from Frank Tashlin, for example, or see Norm McCabe's earliest work for the studio.

The four disc's, like the 4 disc's in the previous collections, all follow a specific theme:

1. Bugs Bunny Favorites
2. A Dash of Tashlin
3. Speedy Gonzales in a Flash
4. Kitty Korner

The ""Behind the Tunes"" segments are exceptional. There are 8 altogether:

1. The Art of the Gag
2. Looney Tunes: A Cast of Thousands
3. One-Hit Wonders
4. Sing-a-Song of Looney Tunes
5. Wild Lines: The Art of Voice Acting
6. Twilight in Tunes: The Music of Raymond Scott

2632723,4,B000HC2LGM,"Volume 4 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection boxed sets is a top quality set. Just like every other set, this one contains four discs. Disc one is all Bugs Bunny, but they're some of the more rare ones. Some of my favorites include Rabbit Hood, the Chuck Jones short Knight-Mare Hare, and the Friz Freleng short Southern Fried Rabbit. Disc two is mostly Porky Pig while nearly every cartoon is directed by Frank Tashlin. Favorites include Plane Daffy, I Got Plenty of Mutton, and The Stupid Cupid. Disc three is all Speedy Gonzales. Did you know there were that many Speedy shorts? I didn't. The lame thing is how similar each short is. The same plot, characters, gags, and jokes are recycled and reused in each Speedy cartoon. I was happy when his shorts were pulled from the air. Not because I was offended by them or anything, but because of how boring the character really is. Disc four is a disc full of cat related cartoons by the likes of Chuck Jones, Robert McKimson, and Bob Clampett. Conrad the Sailor, The Sour Puss, and Go Fly a Kit are a few favorites. Some of the extras really make these sets worth owning. Bugs Bunny Superstar and Friz on Film included in this set are some of them. Documentaries that span 60-90 minutes that usually include a handful of cartoons while giving background information on directors of your favorite Looney Tunes. Friz on Film was included on disc three with the Speedy shorts, which really made up for those 15 cartoons I had to force myself to watch. The thing about these Looney Tunes sets is that they usually contain a lot of your favorites, whether you've loved them for years or they're recently discovered, but they're buried within a lot of mediocrity. So even though they're excellently packaged and the digital restoration is amazing, there are only so many Porky or Speedy shorts you can watch in a row before you get antsy. The first and last disc of this set are fantastic while the middle two just feel like filler.

Just because something about me or someone else is the brunt of the humor makes it no less funny. If we can not laugh at ourselves than why should we be able to laugh at anything? The raters use to say that Bugs, Daffy, Foghorn, Speedy, Sylvester, Porky and the rest of the bunch were offensive to minorities and dangerous to children. What a lie. The political climate today is fueled by manipulative pacification and ridiculous accusations. These are just cartoons and some may think that this is not the place to express such concerns, but the censorship that has occurred in the last 20 or so years makes this the place to say the truth about how the political left is ruining American society.",1241654400,7,805,4.558620689655172
2632733,5,B000HC2LGM,"Growing up on Looney toons as a child, I remember cartoons, the old fashioned ones we used to watch on Sat morning in the 70's. They were just pure hysterical gut-busting entertainment, and Bugs Bunny poked fun at everyone. He teaches us to laugh at ourselves, our differences and our alikenesses. It is sad they view him as ""non-PC"" these days (note the disclaimer at the beginning of the DVD's). But, everyone was fair game to him. And, I don't think being humorous is wrong, but it is a product of its time, and we cannot deny it happened. When ""racial or ethnic"" references are made, the humor shows that the one making the reference is just as ridiculous as the one being referred to. So, it was social commentary.

These days, the kids are watching mind numbing, PC to the point of exclusion, educational cartoons at every turn. The fail to show humor, they fail to show it is ok to laugh at ourselves and to embrace our differences that make us who we are. They fail to show just plain old humor, and human nature. And, when a child goes out into the world, they do not know how to handle other people's differences when they encounter those situations. Bugs Bunny makes it all good.

My husband and I were commenting on this one day. How the cartoons are not the same as they used to be. We discovered that both of our favorite episode was the one with Yosemite Sam and his ""stupid"" dragon. We went on a search of this episode which brought us to this purchase. We now have two Looney Tunes anthologies. And, our kids love them, it is a great family time to share. There are historical and literary references that I also feel teach them. But, most of all it is the healing laughter we all enjoy. Plus, we have to explain to our children the meaning behind some of those references, and how society has come to deal with it.

We love this Collection, and will undoubtedly be back for more.",1238716800,4,1897,4.414285714285715
2632734,5,B000HC2LGM,"Having grown up on these cartoons, I jumped at the chance to get the first four volumes, with the first three together as a package, at a nice discount, then this volume alone.
I was definitely NOT disappointed!
There were also some extras, such as isolated soundtracks, alternate takes, and occasional documentaries.
Classic is a very overused term these days, but these wonderful old cartoons exemplify classic in every way, from the wonderful animation, instantly recognized sound effects, truly funny story lines, and (possibly most of all) the voice of the legendary, late and very great Mel Blanc.
If you grew up watching these, you already know what I am talking about.
If you haven't had the pleasure of watching cartoons the way they were MEANT to be, I must urge you to buy at least one volume, and I bet you will be hooked.
I will sound like one of those old fogies when I say it, but Spongebob Squarepants simply pales in comparison to these.

Unfortunately, the Bugs Bunny selections are a mixed bag, with ""Operation: Rabbit"" and the Oscar-winning ""Knighty Knight Bugs"" among the few highlights. Despite the generous amount of special features (including the 1975 ""Bugs Bunny Superstar"" documentary and three Private Snafu shorts), Volume Four lacks a well-rounded display of Warner Bros. cartoon madness.",1224979200,,651,5.269230769230769

2632740,4,B000HC2LGM,"Volume four is a slight improvement over volume three in the Looney Tunes Collection. It's a four disc collection with fifteen shorts per disc for a total of sixty cartoons. As in previous sets each disc has a theme. Disc one is ""Bugs Bunny Favorites""; Bugs Bunny has been the lead off set in every edition thus far. Disc two is ""A Dash of Tashlin"" that features Porky Pig. Disc three is ""Speedy Gonzalez in a Flash"" which features ""the fastest mouse in all Mexico"". Disc four is ""Kitty Korner"", a set that features different cats including Sylvester.

As in the other Golden Collections disc one, featuring Bugs Bunny, is the best disc in the set. Many of these are classic Bugs which includes the Academy Award winning ""Knighty Knight Bugs"".

Disc two which features Porky Pig is the weakest disc in the set. Though Warner Bros. didn't dig into their vaults quite as much in this collection, they have, once again, pulled out some old one for Porky Pig. There are several on the disc that are b&w only.

Speedy Gonzalez is the star of disc three. Speedy was one of Warner Bros. later creations that fared well. Two of the shorts were nominated for Academy Awards but no winners. One short, ""The Wild Chase"", has Speedy, Sylvester, Road Runner & Wile E. Coyote. There are several shorts from this disc that actually come from the sixties.

Several different cats are featured on disc four. Most of these are Chuck Jones creations; some feature the ""cute kitten"" which includes the ferocious bulldog who becomes his caretaker.

Warner Bros. hasn't been skimpy with these Golden Collections. The remastering is nothing short of perfect, the bonus features abound & there are some ""rare"" cartoons that surface in the ""From the Vaults"" featurettes. One of the primary features is ""Bugs Bunny Superstar"" which is presented in two parts. It's a good thing that Warner Bros. has given so much attention to these sets because they are expensive. I miss not having more Daffy Duck in a set though & the set of Speedy is just a little too much of him in one shot. I've never been a big fan of Porky Pig either, so disc two is a little too much of Porky for my tastes. All the special features are entertaining, some give very good background information. This is good, not great, collection of Looney Tunes that can be enjoyed by young & old, alike.

But I do have one request for Warner Bros.: Is it possible to have TWO releases a year instead of only one? I know it's good marketing strategy but these cartoons are almost impossible to see anymore unless one has the granddaddy of satellite or cable packages.

ARTWORK ON THE DISCS THEMSELVES
Volume 1--It's stupendous! It's colossal!....
Volume 2--Not bad...
Volume 4--Just OK
I guess they ran out of steam (or money).
PICTURE/SOUND QUALITY--Fabulous.
BONUS FEATURES
A fantastic array of goodies on all volumes...
HOWEVER.....On Volume 2, Disc 4 is listed as having ""Sinkin' in the Bathtub"". On the disc, I can't find it. Was it in an Easter egg I missed?
And in Volume 4, Disc 2, there's a SNAFU cartoon called ""The Goldbrick"". Warner cartoons zip and sparkle at the industry standard film speed of 24 frames per second.  Warner Bros. DVD has very lovingly transferred this gem at the wrong film speed of 18 frames per second! The soundtrack slogs along through the mud, and the animation looks jerky. To the meatball at Warner's who made the executive decision to pull this little stunt, I say, ""You're dethpicable!""
THE MEANING OF ""RESTORED AND REMASTERED""
I cringe every time I see these words on DVDs of classic animation, because they mean whatever the manufacturer chooses, NOT Daniel Webster.
On Disc 4 of Volume 2, two of my all-time favorites ""Hollywood Steps Out"" and ""Have You Got Any Castles"" challenge the definition of ""restored"".
The beginning and ending of ""Castles"" includes scenes which were cut from the laser disc edition. As the camera pans over to a town crier, 2 BIG, THICK vertical scratches run through, marking the start and end of the part to be edited. My God! I hope this isn't the original negative!  But not to worry. Nowadays, digital cut-and-paste technology allows frame-by-frame restoration of such defacing on any computer. But Warner's did NOT restore this. It's a jarring, disturbing experience. Way to go!
In ""Hollywood"", there is a scene of The Three Stooges, and HERE is where the Warner's digital computer wizardry was used. On each and every frame, Moe's hair has been beautifully painted PURPLE.  So, instead of using the computer to restore ""Castles"", they spent endless hours at the computer, frame by frame, giving us purple hair on Moe, which nobody ever wanted anyway. Imagine the guy at Warner's who came up with THAT bright idea. What a maroon.
I'm a little bit wary to watch more of these cartoons, afraid of whatever other ""improvements"" I may unearth. In any case, every time I encounter this digital fiddling, I can't help but think ""This is no way to run a railroad"".",1200528000,,2583,4.826185101580135

I was especially a fan of Bugs Bunny; and in Kindergarden I would kid after school that I was Bugs and pretend I was smoking a carrot! Then I have seen some of these on sattelite and an independant tv station that I watched. I know in college, my last year and things did not seem so great, I could pick up a half hour of these cartoons in the afternoon when I was back from school. Now I realize that Bugs has a New York City accent!
We have two cats-one homeless from the street and one from the animal shelter. I could watch them romp around and wresle for hours if I could. I noticed that there is even a natural humor in animals and how they play. So, I thought of these Warner Brothers cartoons!
Some of them had to be WWII era nostalgia-like the one about Matta Hari. And the one about the army inducting a rabbit-Bugs Bunny. And the one about the slacker who inadvertantly helps Tojo by his goldbricking.
The Southern ones were hillarious. My mom comes from the South and my dad from Germany. And the cultural clashes in our home were humorous to me. I know I drank Dr. Pepper in high school because mom said she drank it in Kentucky when she was younger.
Wiley Coyote and the Rood Runner. I have a hard time imagining anyone putting on his business card WILEY COYOTE, GENIUS! I belonged to Mensa so I got a real kick out of that!
There is nothing dirty or occultic in these cartoons. And alot of the puns in the cartoon dialogue must have been put there for the adults entertainment, too!",1199577600,,1566,4.276094276094276

The Speedy Gonzales disc includes a film with Slowpoke Rodriguez, who was a rare, but fun, character in Looney Tunes.

The Bugs Bunny disc was excellent, but I agree with some reviewers that these ancient cartoons from the thirties and early forties don't do anything for me at all. I would definitely prefer more frome the late forties onward, and I (personally) would like to see more of Yosemite Sam and Foghorn Leghorn in future sets.  I also am getting a bit tired of the politically overcorrect disclaimers included evidently to appease the thought police who view anything they don't approve of as evil and wrong, and it would be appreciated (at least by me), if Warner Bros. would worry a little less about placating the fit pitchers and more about releasing more of the most popular cartoons that everyone is waiting for, regardless of whether they meet today's politically overcorrect standards.

2632770,4,B000HC2LGM,"I have to agree with another reviewer about the packaging: disc removal is awkward at best. We're starting to see some redundancy in information contained in the featurettes (bonus features) with respect to other features on previous collection discs, which is a bit annoying. Also, on a couple of menus (disc 4) we see some rather sloppy (rushed?) design work in menus, like K-9 and Marvin the Martian, who don't even appear in this set. Certainly the effort was all put into the animation restoration, but a little more care in the packaging and presentation would help keep these volumes consistent.

While all of the original cartoons deserve to be released, we seem to be getting more of the, shall we say, not quite as well crafted pieces, while some real gems are still unreleased. This could be due to something like the difficulty in finding uncut, well preserved prints, etc. But I'm most fearful that by rationing out the best works, sales will slip and Warner will just stop releasing them.

To be clear, my complaints are minor. These still represent some of the greatest cartoons of the 20th century, and most are yet to be outdone. If you don't own any of the Golden Collection volumes, I might not start with this one (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Looney-Tunes-Golden-Collection-Volume-One/dp/B0000AYJXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Looney Tunes - Golden Collection, Volume One</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Looney-Tunes-Golden-Collection-Volume-Two/dp/B00020SK1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Looney Tunes - Golden Collection, Volume Two</a>&nbsp;are stronger IMHO).

This contains most of the Looney Tunes that people over the age of about 21 today hold dear to their hearts. One thing in watching this set makes you realize that even though the titles may not ring a bell, once you see these cartoons you know them and realize how much of them have been ingrained into your subconscious, as they appeared constantly on movie and television screens from the 1930s until about ten years ago thanks to those no good tutti-fruity Politically correct killjoys who push the likes of Barney and the Teletubbies down kids throats, but I digress.

The 1970s documentary BUGS BUNNY SUPERSTAR is quite interesting. Some good stuff with Bugs and co. mixed with interviews of the men who created them. Educational and interesting-these guys were as crazy as their creations. However, Bugs fans born between 1950 and 1980 will have warm hearts over the inclusion of the theme from the Bugs Bunny television show ON WITH THE SHOW in the extras.

Regarding political incorrectness. As an African-American child, I was never bothered by Bugs dressing up as a Black person to outwit Yosemite Sam in SOUTHERN FRIED RABBIT, as Bugs didn't exactly wear minstrel makeup or the simian-like black caricatures all too common in cartoons of that time that I admittedly despised then as well as now. To say that Speedy Gonzales is embarrassing today is foolish! He almost always outwitted the ""gringo"" characters. But as for the wartime characterizations of the Japanese, I could see how that would casue some concern.

It's more of an shame that we adults have to suffer from the lack of these classic cartoons as well!!

Well these DVDs have changed all that!!

In my book each of these DVD collections have been excellent and Volume 4 is no exception!!

I was really excited to finally get a lot of Speedy Gonzalez cartoons collected for the first time on DVD as well as the first meeting of Wile E Coyote and Bugs Bunny (being that Wile E Coyote is my favorite Looney Tunes character).

The thing that always makes these collections wonderful is the extras, and there is no shortage on extras in this newest collection. We get more Private Snafu military shorts, biographies, lost cartoons, openings, and much more!!

Here's hoping that Warner Brothers CONTINUES to release ALL there Looney Tunes and Merry Melodies cartoons for all of us to see!!!

The third volume wasn't that great. The only disc I really wanted to watch was the Bugs disc. Not to mention they stuck in the tortise and the hare cartoons, which I HATE! Not to mention also, they stuck in the Birds Anonymous cartoon, which I hate even MORE than anything. That cartoon, which stars my all-time favorite duo, makes me uncomfortable, so I don't watch it. At least in this volume, there's a Speedy Gonzales disc. Screw what others say about that disc, I LOVE Speedy. I just wish that when they release these collections, they wouldn't put in the cartoons that don't have the characters I love like Bugs, Daffy, Tweety and so on and so forth. I also wish they'd come up with a Foghorn Leghorn disc. I love those cartoons, too. Hopefully, they won't have any more cartoons that I won't watch in the future, but I can't expect miracles.

Why WB feels they need to fill the tv screen at the expense of some of the action I'll never know.  It's like watching a Cinemascope movie on a tv.  Something is always missing. That said, the cartoons in this collection have been cleaned up nicely.  Lovers of Speedy Gonzales will particularly like this collection. A nice change from the last release is the omission of Whoopie Goldberg's appology for racial slurs contained in the cartoons that played automatically EVERY time you inserted the disks.  Every disk.  I found that very annoying.

2632825,5,B000HC2LGM,"A disclaimer happens on all four DVD's-however, it is just a text message, and I liked that a LOT better this time around, so that was an improvement.  The physical packaging is worse though, as you have to remove one DVD to get to the other-each DVD in the past editions had their  own insert within each boxed set.

Like the other volumes, this is a great addition for a collector, not a casual viewer who is looking for episodes that were only broadcast on television.  Disc 3 for me was not as engaging as the other discs because it's mostly made up of Speedy Gonzales versus a nemesis over and over again.  With other characters, you have more variation, although in the documentaries, Friz Freleng admits Speedy Gonzales was not his favorite character.  In this particular volume, there were many alternate memorable characters who appeared a handful of times, or maybe even once, never to be seen again, like Dodsworth and Heathcliff (NOT related to The Creators Syndicate Heathcliff).

One of the episodes, ""Porky's Poor Fish"", was slightly blurry for a few seconds, so who knows what happened with that particular episode.  The documentaries are especially good on this volume-for example, they discuss the fact that Warner Brothers originally wanted to use the cartoons to help market Warner Brothers' music they were currently selling.  However, today, when you hear those songs, people associate the songs with the cartoons and don't consciously think of the music separately-an unintended side effect in modern times.  ""Porky's Breakdown"" and seeing the Army promotional material in addition to more Private SNAFU were also great additions.  Several episodes have Daws Butler doing voice acting, which is historically significant as Daws Butler later left for Hanna Barbera and did everything from Mr. Jinks to Quick Draw McGraw and Huckleberry Hound.

Hopefully, Warner Brothers will release a theoretical volume 5 (which will match the number of laserdisc collections) about a year from now...and several people on YouTube have uploaded some of the Private SNAFU episodes as well as the ""Censored 11"", which haven't made it into any golden collection yet.

This will allow fans of Clampett, Avery, even Jones and Freleng to further their collections.

Also, I noticed that there were no Tex Avery shorts here. Luckily they did include two early Clampett shorts, so I'm guessing the next set or two will have an Avery disc, especially when they did a Tashlin disc this time. That shows you how out of touch whoever is compiling these discs are with the audience buying them. Tashlin was never that popular a toon director, even with diehard fans. Specifically not enough to sell a set. Avery and Clampett should already have had a disc by now with that logic, so I figure they are saving them so that when they run low on good toons and they have a set with a disc of Kool Kat toons, they'll throw a Clampett disc together or an Avery disc to sell it.

2632828,3,B000HC2LGM,"Of all the Looney Tunes Golden Collection releases, this is easily the least of the four. In order:

The Bugs Bunny disc is the best of the four, at least as far as laughs go. A few of my favorites are on this disc, but for the most part they're just alright. Friz Freleng has never been my favorite Looney tunes director (that honor goes to Bob Clampett) and there's a good amount of his cartoons on this disc, so I give this one lower marks than I normally would. That's not to say that his cartoons are bad - far from it - but the sum of the parts is almost always greater than the whole with his cartoons. Every director has his share of dogs, of course (like when Chuck Jones tried to duplicate the brilliant DUCK AMUCK with the same thing happening to Bugs Bunny at the hands of Elmer Fudd - I don't enjoy seeing someone get the better of Bugs), but Freleng's cartoons seem to have a higher hit-or-miss ratio than the others. The ones with Wile E. Coyote aren't favorites, either - Wile E. is at his best when he doesn't speak.

Disc Two is given completely over to the cartoons of Frank Tashlin, and while a lot of his later cartoons were genious, his early ones that featured Porky when he was the only star in the house are interesting (to me, anyway) more as curios than anything else. They don't really seem to go anywhere when compared to later output. I keep in mind that the studio was still finding its way when these were made, and that when viewed from an historical perspective, they're interesting, but to me that's all they are. PLANE DAFFY and THE STUPID CUPID are the best examples of Tashlin's work present.

Giving Disc Three completely over to Speedy Gonzales was not a good idea in my opinion. Those cartoons are really only rehashes of the Tweety/Sylvester series and the only one I really enjoy is the first one, where Speedy looks more like a peon than the more streamlined version he ended up as. Again, the sum of the parts is greater than the whole with these cartoons.

I like what they did with disc four and think they should continue to do what they did here, which is to feature the one-shot or limited run cartoons the studio created that don't feature the studio's ""stars"". There are a lot of good cartoons on this disc, although one of my favorites, FAIR AND WORM-ER, still hasn't made the cut.

A rather disappointing collection this time.",1167436800,10,2380,4.412300683371298
2632829,3,B000HC2LGM,"Main complaints I have with these cartoon collections is that they are a little on the pricey side and it would be better if the volumes were put in chronological order that they were made. The Tashlin ones were my favorite. Some of the ones with Porky and ""Puss and Booty"" I had seen before only in color. Turns out that most of the Porky and Daffy Looney Tunes produced from 1936 to 1943 in black and white were colorized by WB/Seven Arts in 1967. And from my findings, Puss and Booty was the very last black and white Looney Tunes made.

The Speedy Gonzales collection is lacking as well and could have been more, but they make up by putting the ones from the 1960's with him and Daffy Duck.

I'm still waiting on Foghorn Leghorn cartoons for release and to my knowledge, none of them have been released yet.",1166313600,2,811,4.364238410596027
2632850,5,B000HC2LGM,"If you've got the others, grab this set as well. Looney Tunes have never looked better.

This time around, the box set is smaller and much more efficient. The previous sets had one disc per fold-out, which left extra space on the opposite side to fill up with dumb quotes from the shorts. Now the layout is much better.

The cover art however, could've been much better. It looks so much like the first volume - why couldn't they do something different? Volume 3's cover was refreshing, volume 4's looks bland. The gloss and emboss is nice, though.

I love the black and white shorts - the sense of humour in the early 30's shorts is totally different from later years. The characters would always make objects do things they weren't supposed to - like grabbing another character's body and turning it into a musical instrument; or opening the bartender's mouth like a cash register and his tongue provides the change. Great creative stuff that is totally different from the slapstick jokes of later shorts. Not better, just different.

Compared to the previous collections, this one seems a little rushed. Every collection is top-notch, however this one is a bit lacking in extras. The menu comes straight up, there's no menu intro like the previous discs. This is nice because it saves time, but I get the feeling they didn't have the time to do it. Whoopee is gone, which is good - I had no problem with her, but her intro took up time when loading the disc.

It also seems they're starting to scrape the barrel trying to find bonus features:

""New 2006 Short Porky and Daffy in The William Tell Overture"" - this is really lame. They grabbed art and gags from previous shorts and threw them in this new short. The fact that they used all old sound effects and purposely lowered the quality of the music was interesting, but the short was painful. The magic is gone guys, stop trying to make new Tunes (especially Macromedia Flash Looney Tunes).

""Powerhouse in Pictures"" and ""Bugs Bunny in 3 1/2 Minutes"" - Filler material. Both of these go nowhere. Anyone can slap this stuff together.

The Private SNAFU shorts are somewhat interesting, though you need to know more about the history of Looney Tunes in order to understand where they're coming from. I'm not sure if there's been a feature in a past collection on why the SNAFU shorts were created, or the fact that so many references in Looney Tunes are war-related. I'd love to see a feature dedicated to WWII's influence on Looney Tunes, and explaining many of the references - like ""A"" Cards, ""Is this trip really necessary?"", etc.

Overall, a great collection! A few small issues are a little disappointing, but that's only because we've been so spoiled with the last sets. Well done WB.

Overall: 5 stars

Compared to previous collections: 4 stars (bonus features lacking, cover art is nothing new)

(whoa mule, whoa camel, whoa dragon) disc two ""dash of tashin"" are straight up generic cartoons. nice, cutezy, squirrels singing, birds chirping, you will watch it once and that will be that. disc three is speedy gonzalez a character i never cared for and a disc that may not even be watched once. disc four is dedicated to cats. i have three cats so its not as though i don't appreciate them, (the animals not the toons) its just that basically you have another disc of mostly less then memorable generic cartoons. i hate to be the one that dissents from all the other glowing five star reviews but its not like these sets come out all that frequently and they don't come cheap and if i may, i never cared for these ""theme things"" i would greatly prefer chronologic order. colombia does this theme stuff with its three stooges shorts and it drives me nuts. each disc comes with a written disclaimer bemoaning the hurtful and wrong images blah, blah, blah. there are a boat load of special features that you watch once or maybe not at all. another reviewer noted some edits and i also noted one in rabbit hood i remember robin hood says something in the end of the cartoon that appears to be edited here. okay, so i read my own review and it sounds so down, but honestly i thought volume four would be much much better. there are dozens and dozens of great toons sitting in some vault somewhere till who knows when?",1164758400,129,1727,4.383177570093458

Each disk has a theme, as described above. I found the Speedy Gonzales sequence to be a bit much, but I like the idea on the whole. I also like the fact that the editors weren't slavish about the disk themes - a few Roadrunner cartoons slipped in, and were very welcome. The extras are good, too, at least the ones I've seen. Private Snafu may be my favorite among them. He's a WWII artifact, a series of training films on topics of military importance. Since the series was aimed at soldiers, the cartoonists added some racier elements to address the audience in terms of its own interests. The pinups and such are G-rated by today's standards, but created a different ambience than seen in the usual kids' cartoons.

Although the collection is very enjoyable as a whole, it doesn't contain any that I'd call major classics. Even so, the combination of old favorites, new friends (including the flying cat!), and informative commentary is a winner.

2632853,5,B000HC2LGM,"I've been buying these collections as son as they've become affordable (i.e. used). I have to say on behalf of Warners that while there are plenty of classic cartoons that haven't been released yet, there's a reason, and it's a simple one: if ALL the really great shorts were on Volume One, there'd be nothing left to look forward to in the later releases. Better to save some of the great stuff so there's a good reason to keep buying them. They're not stupid. Be patient, this collection has plenty in it to look forward to and enjoy! The Bugs Bunny lineup in Vol. 4 is especially delectable, and disc three will delight the Speedy Gonzales fans. Sure there are some great cartoons I'm waiting for myself. They'll be along in future installments of this series. Until then...enjoy, Doc!",1164585600,4,788,4.676258992805756
2632854,5,B000HC2LGM,"This, the fourth volume of Warner's remastered Looney Tunes DVD series, is the best one since the first (at least as far as Bugs Bunny goes). Like on the previous three sets, each disc is themed and kicks off with a Bugs Bunny disc. This disc alone is worth the price of the set, and is arguably the best Bugs collection yet. Unlike the previous two collections, we are not swamped with the Ted-Turner owned pre-1948 cartoons, but rather with the classic post-1948 films. Fans who grew up with the BUGS BUNNY/ROAD RUNNER SHOW on CBS (such as myself) will find many memories here: ""Roman Legion-Hare,"" ""Rabbit Hood"", ""Mississippi Hare,"" ""Sahara Hare"" etc.

I was less thrilled about the Frank Tashlin disc, but it is interesting to have original black-and-white Porky Pigs, instead of the redrawn, colorized W7 prints that flooded TV during the late sixties. There are some funny cartoons on this set. I particularly like ""I Got Plenty of Mutton"" and ""The Stupid Cupid""

Speedy Gonzales is not my favorite character, but it is nice to have an entire disc devoted to the mouse. It is my hope that Foghorn Leghorn and Pepe Le Pew will receive similar treatment on future volumes.

The weakest disc is the fourth, devoted to obscure cats. Still, many of the cartoons are funny, and when looked at as part of a bigger collection, it's good to have them.

The commentaries are nice, but nothing to rave about. The feature, BUGS BUNNY SUPERSTAR is a nice addition, but the combined use of dubbed, remastered, and old prints makes it seem uneven. The extra FRIZ ON FILM was excellent, and essential. As always, the BUGS BUNNY SHOW segments are good to have. Also the disclaimer is much better this time (no more Whoopee thank GOD).

The packaging sucks and represents the lowest point reached by Warners thus far. I solved the problem by buying new DVD cases.

2632855,5,B000HC2LGM,"First let me say that the restoration of these cartoons makes them look better that they have ever been seen!

Disc #1 contains all complete uncut cartoons.

But Disc #2 contains some edits & re-issue film prints, if you see a ""Blue Ribbon"" Merry Melodies title card, it is not the original title card but a re-issue.  In at least one case, 'YOURE AN EDUCATION"", the re-issue cartoon has been edited for its theatrical re-issue some time in the 1940's;

""YOURE AN EDUCATION"" edits:

@ 01:09  =  The ""Sunny California"" joke has been removed (pause on the fade-in and you will catch some frames of this missing joke).

@ 02:11  =  The ""Gota Canal"" joke has been removed (pause on the fade-out and you will catch some frames of the missing joke).

Commentator Daniel Goldmark either doesn't notice this, of chooses not to comment on it.

""STUPID CUPID"" edits:

At the end of the cartoon the picture abruptly fades out as if the final punchline has been removed.  This could have been done by the 1944 censors just prior to the films theatrical release, or it could have been done for the re-issue as this is a ""Blue Ribbon"" re-issue film print. This print also looks grainier than the others.

Commentator Eddie Fitzgerald makes mention of this edit.

In both cases, original uncut prints & negatives seem to be non-existant.

2632856,4,B000HC2LGM,"I was quite excited to see that a fourth installment of the Golden Collection was coming out, and put in an order as soon as I heard about it.

A couple days ago I got the discs in the mail, and popped them in, waiting to see what great cartoons they contained. Instead I was immediately hit with a politically correct statement about the humor which these discs contain. Why was this necessary? Are we at a point in society that we are so scared of offending someone that everything needs to come with a disclaimer?

Is it ok to posit today's viewpoints on art that was drawn 60 and 70 years ago? These cartoons are more than just animation put in a series of photographs run at 24 frames per second. They are a part of American history that reflect more than adequately their time in America. Growing up and watching these cartoons on television, I never thought of Speedy Gonzalez as part of a stereotype. I saw him as a really fast mouse that was a hero to all the other mice. Pepe Lepew was simply a love-lorn loser. Who cares if he is a French skunk?

That disclaimer I think does more harm than good. Children who think highly of these characters may have their views of them distorted into something they were never intended to be.

If people have such a problem with this, and I honestly doubt many do, then they should come to their own conclusions instead of being told what to think about these cartoons.

Fortunately my opinions and perceptions are pretty well in place, and despite the attempt on telling me what to think about the cartoons, I still find them funny. And no I am not a racist. Despite the disclaimer, I can still give this a high rating. Come to your own conclusion about these cartoons, these pieces of art that are Americana. If you find them offensive, send them back.

Possibly,Turner will reconsider. These shorts contained situations found offensive by African-Americans and Orientals,respectively.

2632871,4,B000HC2LGM,"These days, with all the hype around animation on televsion, is it sometimes just too easy to really forget about the classics in animation. While so many youngsters are definitely more interestd in cartoon gems like Spongebob Squarepants, Jimmy Neutron, and Fairly Odd Parents, many people don't seem to remember about those days where the classic animation was organic and fresh. That is why the Looney Tunes have still been a essential part of animation today. With Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig and others, their classic era in animation has long been forgotten by so many. Thankfully, the success of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection, many are rediscovering those wonderful Warner Brothers gems of the 40's and 50's. Now, the fourth edition has come around, and it definitely delivers.

The Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 4, continues to reflect on the classic era of Warner's greatest animated classics. The DVD set features 60 delightful shorts that are still fun and entertaining. Disc 1, like the previous DVD editions of the golden collection is all about Bugs Bunny himself. This editon features so many great hare-brained classics that some of them even haven't been on home video before. There are just a lot of delightful classics from the only Bugs Oscar-winning short Knighty Knight Bugs, and other middle aged set cartoons like Chuck Jones' classic Knight-Mare Hare which was set as a parody of Mark Twain's A Conneticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, and Rabbit Hood. There are also other great gems from To Hare Is Human, Rabbit Romeo, and The Grey Hounded Hare where Bugs falls for a robotic rabbit at a greyhound dog race.

Disc 2: Highlights the era of legendary unsung hero Frank Tashlin, or as some of the classic cartoon historians called him, Tish Tash. The cartoons that are highlighted in this volume are mostly from the 30's, and 40's. Some of the cartoons here have influenced later characters like I've Got Plenty Of Mutton, which later influenced characters Ralph Wolf and Sam Sheepdog, and The Case Of The Stuttering Pig, which was one of the very few cartoons that featured Petunia, Porky's significant other, and gems like The Stupid Cupid where Cupid Elmer tries to make Daffy fall in love with a hen, and it backfires on him.

Disc 3: to myself is considered the actual crown jewel of all the discs in this collection. This volume features Speedy Gonzales, and it has really been long overdue that a volume has featured him. These past few years, when Looney Tunes cartoons were featured on Cartoon Network, all of Speedy's classics were sadly blacklisted, with fears of discriminating Mexican-Americans. This however is the first time since 1985 a Speedy feature has been placed on home video. This edition features a lot of great follies from the Fastest Mouse in All Mexico!! The episodes here not just highlight Speedy and his bouts against Sylvester, but also some of the cartoons after Warner Brothers Termite Terrace era, facing Daffy Duck too. This disc features greats like Speedy's debut in Cat-Tails For Two, and Speedy Oscar-nominated classics The Pied Piper Of Guadalupe by Friz Freleng, and Tobasco Road, Speedy's 3rd cartoon. Other greats here highlighted are Pancho's Hideaway, the only time Speedy is paired off against a Bandito who looks and acts similar too Yosemite Sam, and The Wild Chase, where the answer is decided who is the fastest Speedy Gonzales or Chuck Jones' favorite speed demon, The Road Runner. The actual only disadvantage with this disc is that the classic self-titled Speedy Gonzales wasn't highlighted here. That was featured on the first volume of the Golden Collection.

The fourth disc is really a compilation of kitty kat-tastrophy. This disc features some of the best in Warner's lesser-known cat characters from Claude Cat in The Aristo-Cat, the kitten Pussyfoot, which pairs off with dog Marc Anthony in two cartoons Kiss Me Cat, where the dog tries to mak sure Pussyfoot stays in their happy home and keeps the mischief and the mouse away, and Cat Feud. There are also more funnies from Sylvester here too, including Mouse and Garden where Sylvester and his friend Sam spend the night in a abandoned shaft on the pier, trying to fight over a single mouse in the house, andThe Unexpected Pest where Sylvester make a slave into a mouse, just to keep his stay in his home.

All in all, the shorts have all been restored and remastered to the best quality, and just still as funny and exciting to watch. There are also a lot of great extras here too, highlighting moments around Speedy, and how he became the mouse we all know of today, and the documentary Bugs Bunny Superstar, and the short of 50 years in 3 1/2 minutes, which was featured as part of Happy Birthday Bugs: 50 Looney Years primetime special from 1990.

If there is one DVD boxed set I definitely recommend, this happens to be that one. I still enjoy the Looney Tunes shorts today, because they are fun to watch, and filled with laughter and promise. If you're a die hard fan of these laughable cartoons, I definitely recommend this as an addition to your DVD collection. If you haven't seen these cartoons before, you absolutely don't even know what you are truly missing. I hope there is another great volume of these delights that comes up again soon. That is really all folks!!!

2632873,4,B000HC2LGM,"I've been a major fan of the WB cartoons since I was a kid, and even set up a 35mm projector so I could show them in my home whenever one came along. So I've been deighted with the release of these classics on DVD. But I have a few complaints (or whines, if you want to be nasty about it). First one is, the picture on volumes 1,2, and 3 is cropped! If you compare the image on the screen (both small-screen TV and projection) with the originals in 35mm, it's clear that information on all sides of the image has been lost. I'd estimate that the loss amounts to 15% of the total image. Why is this? If the studio is going to go to all the trouble to restore these films, why not put the entire picture on the disc? Has anyone else noticed this? The originals never had the tops of the heads cut, or the feet of the characters at the very bottom of the screen. Or characters partially out of the frame. I hope that WB will remedy this in future releases.

Another thing is, enough with the Whoopi Goldberg apology already! If they want to give her somethng to really apologize for, put ""Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs"" on the disc. Otherwise, give the audience some credit for common sense.

Finally, please, please, NO Depatie-Freling 1960s cheapo unfunny cartoons. We need more Tex Avery & Bob Clampett from the 40s and 50s, not stuff from the years when Termite Terrace was a poor shadow of its former creative self, without even a decent orchestra to pump things up.

2632874,5,B000HC2LGM,"I'm going to be frank here.  First, and foremost, I am grateful for the Looney Tunes Collections.

There are three camps out there regarding the animation of these cartoons: Black and White 1930's, Color classics 1940's and 1950's, and the color demise cartoons in the 60's.

We all have our favorite era and that's fine.

In reading these posts there is a history of these cartoons!

Cartoons in the WB case, were simply additional entertainment before a feature movie at the nickelodeon or the bijou or the movie theatre.

When was the last time you saw a cartoon like the WB's at a movie theatre in this day and age?

All of the cartoons we enjoy from the WB collection are the works of talented individuals to create a lightened atmosphere given thier interpretation of life, history and just plain fun!

The demise was television and other venues of entertainment that killed them.  That and cost. WB only has the film shot, not the original cells, because they were washed clean from the mylars and then re-used for the next cartoon!  Disney saved everything.

But what the WB cartoons gave us were fresh, funny and goofy situations, whose comedy was geared for adults...even the animators said the creations were for 'them' and not the general public....they could care less.... working away in the termite trailer!

All of the WB cartoons are important.  The selfless work of the individuals working away at restoring some 1200 gems of the animators who have gone before them is extremely important to recognize, reflect and respect those few decades of hard work.  And for that, I am grateful.

The focus of these collections is to support and THANK those that work tireless hours to use the ratted old films they have, and bring them to life again for generations to come.

My only reservation is the need to keep them original and uncut.

I remember in the 70's the idiot group that came along thinking these cartoons were making children act out what they saw in them.  What a fallacy.

Then, we have to suffer Whoopie Goldberg teaching us about how bad these cartoons were in stereotypes and how we must remember that was a different time and that although this happened, she still laughed at them.  What the heck does that mean...Be policitically correct and if you have to laugh, by god, it better not be out loud displaying that you are a racist or an idiot because you did not properly respond in the politiclly correct venue?

If we have to have Whoopie then fine.  If that's the disclaimer to keep the cartoons original....okay.  I'll just hit 'next' on my dvd remote.

Lastly, I would caution you parents regarding viewing these cartoons with your children... they may light dynamite, they might set a deadfall of a rock on a roadrunner...they might go against slow poke Rodriguez...and god forbid...paint thier backs to look like a skunk!",1163030400,18,2859,4.764227642276423

This volume has its hits - the Pussyfoot shorts, Bugs vs Wile E, the bonus Private Snafu shorts - but also has rather a lot of misses - namely Speedy Gonzales.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those 'PC' people who frowns on Speedy's supposed racial stereotyping. I think that his cartoons are great in moderation. Volume 2 was critised for a large chunk of Roadrunner cartoons - Speedy is just as difficult to take in a large dose. The other problem is that we are now starting to get De Patie-Freling Looney Tunes coming through - surely not necessary at this point. To include The Wild Race, a badly done composite cartoon (admitedly with a great concept) is unforgivable when there is a huge vein of black and white shorts yet to be mined. These DVDs are always marketed as 'for collectors' so B&W cartoons should not be an issue. it does seem that Warners are trying to please two camps and not pleasing either.

As I say, this is a minor criticism really as I have enough patience to wait until all of the Looney Tunes shorts are released through these collections (a long way to go yet!). I'm just rather disappointed to see that there are no real stand-out shorts in this particular volume.

Whenever you see text on the screen, it is obvious that the original image has been cropped and enlarged to fill the screen. Check out 'Rebel Rabbit' in vol. 3. What is up with that?? I am going to buy vol 4 right now, and I will be watching for this.

  I also have to agree with a previous reviewer and state that the WORST of the looney tunes are better than 99+% of cartoons being produced today. What has happened to this art form?

  If you ask me, the strength in older shows and cartoons always seems to come from the plot. TV writers these days seem to be severely lacking in creativity - modern cartoons make absolutely no sense and modern TV is just about sex (yawn).

  The Bugs Bunny shorts included on this set are easily some of the best yet out of all the 4 volumes. I can't wait, especially for Southern Fried Rabbit'!

  My only complaint would be that Foghorn Leghorn and Marvin the Martian are conspicuosly absent from the collections. What's up with that? The 'Marvin' episodes were my mother's all time favorites.

2632879,5,B000HC2LGM,"As a fan of the the stylized UPA look of the 1950's Warners cartoons, I am excited about this DVD set--particularly the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  There really are quite a few hidden gems here.

Perhaps Speedy Gonzales isn't for everyone, but Cat Tails for Two is among the funniest Looney Tunes ever made (""P-E-T-R-O-L....that sure is a funny way to spell 'water'....""  ""where did you go at, George?""  ""I love Mexican food, George.  It gives me the heartburn and I LOVE it..."")

Likewise, I like the selection of Bugs cartoons here, as I love the way he evolved, artistically and as a character during the 1950's, when most of these cartoons were released.  Though it was censored for years because of violence (the revolver exploding in Nasty Canasta's face), Barbary Coast Bunny is a true classic (""of course you realize, this is not going to go unchallenged..."").  Bugs' ""tel-e-o-phone"" prank makes me laugh out loud every time I see it.  He had the range to play Brunehilda at one end of the spectrum AND a simply country rube at the other.  What talent!

And who can forget Bugs' confrontations with Yosemite Sam in Roman Legion Hare and Knighty-Knight Bugs  (""Dragons is soooo stupid"")

Of course we all have our favorites, but there's plenty here to enjoy.  There WERE no bad Looney Tunes!

That said, cast another vote for Ali Baba Bunny (""consequences, shmonsequences...I'm a happy miser..."")  for the next collection.  And  a vote for the sadly overlooked Hare-less Wolf, featuring none other than the dimwit Charles M. Wolf!  (""Now, let's see, what WAS I chasin'?  A hippopotamus?  No, no...not a hippopotamus..."")",1162425600,9,1621,4.907749077490775

-Stupor Duck, Daffy goes Superman and saves things that don't need it.

-From Hare To Heir, Yosemite Sam has to be nice to Bugs to get money. Dirty rackin frackin rabbit!

One of the worst characters to become popular was Speedy Gonzales. Every episode plot was the same--think Casper or Baby Huey cartoons. Volume Four seems to be a dumping zone for every Speedy Gonzales episode ever made. There are a few rare jems such as...

Rabbit Hood - 1949

8 Ball Bunny - 1950

Mississippi Hare - 1949

Southern Fried Rabbit - 1953

Kiss Me Cat - 1953

Plane Daffy - 1944

The Grey Hounded Hare - 1949

Hurdy-Gurdy Hare - 1950

Now that would be the worst thing that could happen. What would we have to look forward to in the next release? I think it's fine.

I understand everyone's frustration with too much or too little variety in these box sets. But volume four, just like any of the other volumes, on it's own is not the entire collection. Once all ten box sets are released (as they announced they'll release), we'll then have the whole collection. Like a disc is part of the box set, here the box set is part of the collection.

For this reason, I believe the themed discs and packaging are perfect the way that they are. It takes so much time to digitally restore each of these cartoons, months in fact, that it's taking the studio years to do it. But once all of it comes together in the end, I believe this will be one of the greatest DVD collections of all time. Just give it time and the whole picture will come together.

Who decided a Tashlin disc without ""Nasty Quacks"" and ""Unruly Hare"" was a great idea?!?  There was plenty of dead wood on this disc that could have been cleared away to make room for those two gems.

2632928,4,B000HC2LGM,"Bugs Bunny was recently overheard saying on the Warner Brothers lot....

America is a great country, ain't it, Doc? Where else do people pay for a product that they really only want 25% of?

It's Bug's you really want. Alright, alright...perhaps dat ain't fair. Daffy, Porky and the rest of the gang have their moments. And some of the lesser known classics that feature none of the popular characters are ""nice to have"", but ain't ""need to have"", Doc.

But the Bugs Bunny shorts in this collection make it woith the dough and woith the 4 star rating. HIT THE BUY BUTTON, for sure, Doc.

It sure would be nice to be giving 5 stars to an all Bugs Bunny collection though. I mean why couldn't they sell the individual character collections separately. Rhetorical question, really. The answer is good old American capitalism. And us marooooons keep buyin' 'em, so no point in complaining anymore, Doc.

If they release one collection on its own it should be the ""banned"" collection. This way those who might be offended don't have to purchase it. Here's the list of what us collectors would like to see that haven't been released...please Mr. Warner, let us see 'em again:

Bushy Hare - Featuring the stereotypical Aborigine ""Nature Boy"",...""UNGA BUNGA BUNGA INGA BINGA BINGA BUNGA!!!! What'd I say?! What'd I say?!""

Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt - Featuring a stereotypical Elmer Fudd trying to catch Bugs.

Bunker Hill Bunny - Bug's says, ""Your brother blows bubble gum.""

All This and Rabbit Stew - The only Bugs cartoon on the Censored Eleven, featuring a stereotype trying to catch Bugs.

Any Bonds Today? - Bugs Bunny and friends promote war bonds, with Bugs doing a Jolson impression.

Fresh Hare - A firing squad that turns ""into a stereotype"" at the end to sing along to Bugs' last wish of being in Dixie. Elmer and Bugs jump into snow drifts leaving silhouettes...one of Bug's silhouettes is a shapely woman.

Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips - One of the most infamous Bugs Bunny cartoons, with Bugs fighting stereotypes during World War II.

Herr Meets Hare - Bugs and Hitler in the Black Forest.

Which is Witch? - A stereotypical witch doctor needs Bugs as an ingredient.

Horse Hare - Yosemite Sam leads Indian stereotypes to invade Bugs' fort.

A Feather In His Hare - Another American Indian stereotype trying to catch Bugs.",1158192000,,2324,4.7725
2632929,3,B000HC2LGM,"I suppose that sooner or later Speedy Gonzales was bound to dominate an entire ""Golden Collection,"" but I was definitely hoping that it was going to be Volume XXIV and not this one. Two or three of Speedy's shorts would be tolerable, but it appears as if his entire oeuvre has been collected on this set.  As was the case with so many of Robert McKimson's post 1960's cartoons, many of these are totally forgettable and I suspect I'll be skipping around like crazy as I did when presented with more than three Tweety or Road Runner cartoons in a row on the earlier collections. On the other hand, I was shocked to see how few Daffy Duck cartoons were included in this set.  Where are the great late 1940's Daffy cartoons such as ""Riff Raffy Daffy,"" ""The Stupor Salesman,"" or the side-splitting ""Daffy Dilly?"" The Duck just don't get no respect!

I have to say that I was incensed to see the inclusion of a few of the post-1964 absolutely worthless DePatie-Freleng cartoons as well. These should be buried forever and never included on any subsequent collections.  I remember watching some of those on TV as a kid and thinking ""how the heck did Daffy Duck end up being second banana to a Mexican rodent?""  The bottom line is that they just aren't funny. It was nice, however, to see at least a few 1930's cartoons, although how long will it be until ""The Major Lied Till Dawn,"" ""Jeepers Creepers,"" and Tex Avery's art deco opus ""Miss Glory"" see the light of day?

After the absolutely worthless disclaimers from Whoopie Goldberg on the GCV3, I thought that perhaps this set would include some of the fantastically funny (albeit controversial and perhaps a bit racist) cartoons such as ""Coal Black and De Sebben Dwarves,""

""Sunday Go To Meetin' Time,"" ""Clean Pastures,"" ""Uncle Tom's Bungalow,"" ""Goin' To Heaven on a Mule,"" and all the fabulously surreal and totally unseen by anyone under the age of 45 Inki and the Mynah Bird cartoons.  It appears as if WB is still equivocating about those, but if enough people let them know that we're now adults and can handle the content, perhaps they'll relent.  Yeah, right.  Is the most delectable heroine in cartoondom, So White, any more stereotypical than Speedy Gonzales?  Let's try to force this issue with an unrelenting

internet attack!

I understand the economics of releasing these collections so as not to compete with one another, but like the ""Complete Peanuts""

book collections, I worry that at age 53, I might not be around to enjoy the last volume.  Can't the pace be picked up just a little bit to maybe two collections a year with 120 cartoons being represented?  Maybe I'm just a crazy dreamer...

Like everyone else, I'm going to be purchasing each volume of the ""Golden Collection"" as soon as it's available, but I wish they would leave out some of the more forgettable Bugs Bunny

cartoons (""Rabbit Romeo???""  What were they thinking?  That's the absolute worst Bugs short ever!) and delve a bit into some of the more obscure gems among the 750+ cartoons that are still awaiting discovery.  Despite these cavils, when each ""Golden Collection"" volume shows up in my mailbox, I always feel the way I did on Christmas morning when I was a child.  Any complaints I may have are forgotten 8 hours later when I return to the real world, blurry-eyed but definitely better for all the laughter and memories that are kindled by watching the greatest cartoons ever produced.",1157241600,27,3427,4.714765100671141
