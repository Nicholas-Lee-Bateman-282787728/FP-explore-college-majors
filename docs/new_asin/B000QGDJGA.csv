2838022,2,B000QGDJGA,"My almost 3 year old loves Thomas. The only thing is that she prefers the newer, fully animated Thomas movies/episodes as opposed to those where nothing moves or is animated or where only their mouths change position. From looking at the cover of this Thomas movie, I thought that this would be a fully animated one but it isn't. So be forewarned that if your child is like mine and you are trying to buy animated shows, this isn't one of them.",1366675200,,444,4.426829268292683

2838041,5,B000QGDJGA,"You can't go wrong with this video.  Loaded with lots of Thomas's friends, cute sing along songs, short stories, long stories, and interactive guessing games (just like the TV show).  My son is 21 months and loves Thomas & Friends as seen on PBS, but since it is only on a few days a week, we purchased a few videos.  He loved this one.  Not a single complaint.  Another great feature of HIT programing is that you don't have to press play several times to get the vidoe to begin - it begins the program automatically...great for when your tot is in a hurry for Thomas, or you need to calm him/her quickly with no time to spare fussing with the remote over and over or waste time watching a bunch of comercials or pre-movie garbage.  GREAT BUY!

By the way, if your little one is like mine and can't get enough Thomas, visit their website [...].  There is so much to do there:  games, videos, songs, printable coloring pictures and more.  My son loves it!",1205020800,11,955,4.375
2838042,5,B000QGDJGA,"My 2 year old daughter loves Thomas and Friends!  I really enjoy watching too, and this DVD is one of my favorites.  The familiar engines (Thomas, Percy, James, Gordon, Edward, Henry, Emily, and Toby) make appearances, and several newer characters are introduced or featured, such as Rosie, Rocky, and Sir Handel.  Here is a list of episodes on the Carnival Capers DVD and the special features in between episodes.  I've also included the engines that appear in each episode.

Percy And The Carnival - The engines getting ready for the carnival, but Percy is jealous because he only gets to deliver coal.  (Thomas, Edward, Henry, Gordon, Toby, James, Emily, and the Chinese Dragon appear in this episode)

  Which engine is hidden under the coal dust?

Thomas And The Birthday Mail - This story introduces Rosie, a new engine, for the first time.  Rosie wants to be just like Thomas, but Thomas gets really annoyed that Rosie is always following him around.  (Harold makes a brief appearance)

  Which job can Rosie do?

A Smooth Ride - Sir Handel is an older engine who has been known as one of the smoothest engines on the Narrow Gage Controller's railway.  However, Sir Handel has trouble going up hills.  There's only one problem... the Narrow Gage Controller keeps sending him to do jobs where he has to go up hills!  (Thomas, Peter Sam, Duncan, and Mighty Mac make brief appearances)

  A song about the newer engines.

The Green Controller - Sir Topham Hatt has lost his voice, so Lady Hatt comes to Tidmouth Sheds and puts Percy in charge.  Percy is excited about being in charge, but gets confused when giving Gordon, James, and Toby their jobs.  (Thomas also appears)

  Thomas and his friends play a game: which engine is in which shed?

Edward Strikes Out - Edward meets the big new crane named Rocky.  Edward doesn't think Rocky can be very useful since he doesn't have his own engine and would have to be pulled by another engine.  (Thomas, Percy, Gordon, Harvey, and Emily appear)

  A story about Harvey and Rocky and which jobs they are suited for.

Thomas's Frosty Friend - Thomas gets annoyed by a snowman that follows him around... but he doesn't know the snowman is a balloon that has gotten caught on his buffers.  (Percy, Gordon, James, and Emily appear)

  Thomas and Friends theme song.",1201824000,34,2311,4.73989898989899
