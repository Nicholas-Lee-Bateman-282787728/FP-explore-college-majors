4 Episodes:

Freddie the Fruit Bat Saves Halloween:  Diego & Alicia in full Halloween costume are setting up Halloween trick-or-treat stands for all the animals.  But the llamas have all the candy and need help.  Diego and Freddy the Fruit Bat go to save them.  Freddy is one of the more engaging helper animals and the obstacles along the way--including picture drawing spiders--are really fun.  This is one of my 2 year old's favorite episodes.  A note on the spiders--they are completely un-scary--even to an aracnaphobe like me!

Diego and Dora Help Baby Monarch Get to the Festival:  Diego's cousin is Dora the Explorer (who has her own TV series aimed at slightly younger kids).  Dora and Diego help a baby Monarch Butterfly who's just emerged to from her cocoon.

Alicia Saves the Crocodile:  This episode is one of the few where Alicia, Diego's older sister, takes center stage.  For the longest time this was my son's absolute favorite episode and he still loves to talk about how Crocdile eyes shine red.

Manatee's Mermaid Rescue:  Diego and Manatee jump into a storybook to save Mermaid City.  Not my or my son's favorite episode, but the mermaids might really appeal to a little girl.

This and the Diego's Artic Rescue DVD contain my toddler's favorite episodes and are two DVDs I can handle seeing over and over (and over and over) again.",1257552000,2,1402,4.819327731092437
