Half assed low budget animation is accompanied by bad music and voice overs. both light hearted and seriousness is the tone thats deployed...which people nowadays think thats a good idea in anime (in reality its creaters lack of scope and understanding of either). Plot suprisingly is almost work-man like and slightly better than usual for this kind of thing, although the sell is saying ""more plot,to acompany the sex"".It generally though never atemtps to find a happy balance, the drama and plot never take off, and the sex never explict enough. This anime isn't completely rapped around fan service or hentai autopilot,it just as a whole its bad, and at 60 minutes character development is silm to none, theres no vision or scope or even taste to recomend this flat liner. as if it were souly designed for the bargain bin",1139616000,2,971,4.7514792899408285
7889597,5,630546751X,"The reason is really simple. Ok, about a year ago, I got this in the store. I wondered why the sound was so low and everything and parts where the sound completely changed from one part to another (hence, during the first sex scene, notice how the girl says ""and are they uhh..good looking?""..it changes quickly afterwards). The whole reason is even though this is hentai, ( i learned the hard way ), it is the General Release version. Total uncut and unedited hentai is not available in stores nor (sorry to say) on this site. I got my friend to buy me this video uncut on a different site. I noticed the difference (other than the cover being totally changed) that they had to lower the sound because of objectional dialogue they say. The quality of the uncut version is perfect and the sound is made so you can hear everything. Other than that, they readded the two scenes you couldn't see in this version...END",981936000,2,914,4.5120481927710845
7889598,3,630546751X,"Midnight Panther is nothing if not interesting.  It has a decent plot that carries the story without allowing itself to get lost in the violence and sexuality.  However, there are some glaring inconsistencies that detract  from the overall enjoyment of the film.
First, two of the three main  female characters are very well done, but the one who should be the best  (the panther changling) is a total ditz and comes across as the worst.  Second, the sound is poorly done, including several sequences in which the  voice track drops out completely.  Avoid the dubbed version like the  plague; it is HORRIBLE!  Even the Japanese language track doesn't match the  facial movements of the characters.
The animation is an odd combination  of first generation and third generation anime.  In many places, it  strongly resembles the style of the Tolkien classic ""The  Hobbit"".
Fans of anime will probably enjoy this video; however, it  is not a good choice for someone new to the genre.  Additionally, this is  most decidedly NOT a children's title!  It contains strong language,  graphic violence and explicit sexual content.  Like the title says, the  Panthers are best viewed at Midnight!",964569600,,1185,5.0310880829015545
