3166714,5,B00171FPOC,"It's hard to review the episode list of this dvd. But it seems like each dvd release is a season one greater than the one on the box. For example, if you get the fourth season, you're watching the fifth season.... or so according to the episode lists that I google'd. Anyway, I followed the episode list based on the DVDs I have, and the previous releases had episode listed in one season above the one posted on the DVD box. So according to my research, if I am correct, this would be the sixth season, really. I am using TV.com for my information.

Here's a list of the current episodes for this DVD release, I believe:

The Fighting McLains - Walker seeks justice for slain undercover agents.

Iceman - Walker goes undercover to jail to uncover criminals.

Lucas (1) - Walker helps an child with AIDs. Great episode, I remember this one. Did you ever notice walker has his shirt unbuttoned whenever he talks with children.... hmmm...

Lucas (2) - The conclusion to the AIDs episode

Forgotten People - Walker and Trivette hot on the trail of an abusive nursing home. I'm going to watch this episode first. Looks like fun: old people, round house kicks to the face, and jello.

Last of a Breed (1) - Walker tells about the legendary Hayes Cooper. Some of these are really good, especially in the final season.

Last of a Breed (2) - Conclusion of Walker's legendary Hayes Cooper.

Brainchild - Walker helps a child with high IQ find his mother. Seems decent. Probably resembles that episode with the Hindu child.

Mr. Justice - Walker vs a Senator who believes his idea of a ""boot camp"" is not tough enough.

Rainbow's End - Horses, tracks, and Walker. Excellant combination that's going to end with a round house kick to the face and Walker coming out number 1 at the race track while everyone falls in last place.

A Woman's Place - Women complaining about unsafe construction jobs. Sure to have many innunedos with Walker and Trivette even though someone's head just got crushed like a melon.

Small Blessings - Walker saves people who agrees to give testimonies.

Tribe - Greedy oil people kill some Indian dude... big mistake. This reminds me of an episode when Walker went undercover at an oil rig. Sure to have an explosive ending.

Saving Grace - Some just-escaped prisoner hold Nuns hostage instead of running away like what a normal person would do.

Money Talks - A episode with CD and his investigation about a murder. Love to see a fat guy run out of breath? Well this is the episode to watch.

Crusader - Walker helps an ex-wife who hides after witnessing a murder. Probably will have a lot of Walker coming to the rescue at the right moment while the woman get slapped, hard and for no reason.

In God's Hands - Trivette shot a child. Probably Trivette acting unrealistically like in previous episodes where he got in trouble for something he hasn't done. More than likely, Walker will come to the rescue while Trivette starts punching things for no reason.

Undercover - Walker and a drug murder investigation. Like other episodes, this one will probably have a ""new"" drug. Thugs in Dallas doesn't just sell drugs, they make them with their own Chemist who probably has a phd.

Everyday Heroes - Some wife beater and drugs. Probably going to have Walker busting down doors that in real life would nullify everything about an investigation.

Warriors - A crazy group of people will kidnap a geneticit to make super soliders. Gangs in Texas just don't do drive bys, they do genetic super soldiers who can crap heads and pick cars up. That's how they roll in Texas.

Angel - Trivette and his former girlfriend who visits him right out of the blue at his office. Sure to have rediculious events that would never happen, ever.

The Soul of Winter - Some racist decides to take out a minister.

Circle of Life - Walker uncovers some plot by a paroled ex-con who no one will believe.

Test of Faith - Gangs recruit middle-schoolers.

The Wedding (1) - I believe this is the first episode where Walker and Alex gets married. Sure to have ex-boyfriends. If I was going to get married to Alex, my first question would be, ""Did every single one of your boyfriends beat the living crap out of you? What the heck?!?!?""",1213488000,30,4223,4.597333333333333
3166715,5,B00171FPOC,I must be the number one fan of these programs. I have already preordered series number five. Walker is a great insperation for our young people.

In real life, Chuck Norris is a 6-time UNDEFEATED world champion, and he brings that same spirit to Walker, Texas Ranger. Portraying a larger-than-life action hero, Walker kicks butt every step of the way, yet finds time to help those in need. He proves again and again that the finest virtues of the human spirit are alive and well in all of us, and that if reach out to that, there's nothing we cannot do. Chuck Norris really portrays the very best in all of us when he stands up for truth, justice, and the American way, one round kick at a time!",1320451200,,617,4.421052631578948

3166945,5,B00171FPOC,I really like Walker Texas Ranger.  I like to see that he beats the daylights out of the bad ones.  Now days everything is so politically correct that the bad and the wicked get away when the innocent have to put up with it all. It seems that today the law breakers have more rights than the law abiding citizens. It is nice to see justice take place even if it is only in the movies.,1216684800,,384,4.0394736842105265
3166946,5,B00171FPOC,"I agree with previous posters that Walker is great. Walker and Trivette are greatest team since Tonto and Lone Ranger. Trivette is awesome. Watching episodes of Walker Texas Ranger with my (now) 16 year old sons is a high point of family TV enjoyement. Good does triumph over Evil. Crime does not pay. However I must disagree with the lady who said there is never any sex in Walker. There are not a few scenes inside of strip clubs with scantily clad young women swinging on poles, etc. Some seasons more so than others I guess... but you need to have the remote close by to zip though some scenes every now and then.",1215043200,,617,4.421052631578948
3401211,5,B00171FPOC,"It's hard to review the episode list of this dvd. But it seems like each dvd release is a season one greater than the one on the box. For example, if you get the fourth season, you're watching the fifth season.... or so according to the episode lists that I google'd. Anyway, I followed the episode list based on the DVDs I have, and the previous releases had episode listed in one season above the one posted on the DVD box. So according to my research, if I am correct, this would be the sixth season, really. I am using TV.com for my information.

Here's a list of the current episodes for this DVD release, I believe:

The Fighting McLains - Walker seeks justice for slain undercover agents.

Iceman - Walker goes undercover to jail to uncover criminals.

Lucas (1) - Walker helps an child with AIDs. Great episode, I remember this one. Did you ever notice walker has his shirt unbuttoned whenever he talks with children.... hmmm...

Lucas (2) - The conclusion to the AIDs episode

Forgotten People - Walker and Trivette hot on the trail of an abusive nursing home. I'm going to watch this episode first. Looks like fun: old people, round house kicks to the face, and jello.

Last of a Breed (1) - Walker tells about the legendary Hayes Cooper. Some of these are really good, especially in the final season.

Last of a Breed (2) - Conclusion of Walker's legendary Hayes Cooper.

Brainchild - Walker helps a child with high IQ find his mother. Seems decent. Probably resembles that episode with the Hindu child.

Mr. Justice - Walker vs a Senator who believes his idea of a ""boot camp"" is not tough enough.

Rainbow's End - Horses, tracks, and Walker. Excellant combination that's going to end with a round house kick to the face and Walker coming out number 1 at the race track while everyone falls in last place.

A Woman's Place - Women complaining about unsafe construction jobs. Sure to have many innunedos with Walker and Trivette even though someone's head just got crushed like a melon.

Small Blessings - Walker saves people who agrees to give testimonies.

Tribe - Greedy oil people kill some Indian dude... big mistake. This reminds me of an episode when Walker went undercover at an oil rig. Sure to have an explosive ending.

Saving Grace - Some just-escaped prisoner hold Nuns hostage instead of running away like what a normal person would do.

Money Talks - A episode with CD and his investigation about a murder. Love to see a fat guy run out of breath? Well this is the episode to watch.

Crusader - Walker helps an ex-wife who hides after witnessing a murder. Probably will have a lot of Walker coming to the rescue at the right moment while the woman get slapped, hard and for no reason.

In God's Hands - Trivette shot a child. Probably Trivette acting unrealistically like in previous episodes where he got in trouble for something he hasn't done. More than likely, Walker will come to the rescue while Trivette starts punching things for no reason.

Undercover - Walker and a drug murder investigation. Like other episodes, this one will probably have a ""new"" drug. Thugs in Dallas doesn't just sell drugs, they make them with their own Chemist who probably has a phd.

Everyday Heroes - Some wife beater and drugs. Probably going to have Walker busting down doors that in real life would nullify everything about an investigation.

Warriors - A crazy group of people will kidnap a geneticit to make super soliders. Gangs in Texas just don't do drive bys, they do genetic super soldiers who can crap heads and pick cars up. That's how they roll in Texas.

Angel - Trivette and his former girlfriend who visits him right out of the blue at his office. Sure to have rediculious events that would never happen, ever.

The Soul of Winter - Some racist decides to take out a minister.

Circle of Life - Walker uncovers some plot by a paroled ex-con who no one will believe.

Test of Faith - Gangs recruit middle-schoolers.

The Wedding (1) - I believe this is the first episode where Walker and Alex gets married. Sure to have ex-boyfriends. If I was going to get married to Alex, my first question would be, ""Did every single one of your boyfriends beat the living crap out of you? What the heck?!?!?""",1213488000,30,4223,4.597333333333333
3401212,5,B00171FPOC,I must be the number one fan of these programs. I have already preordered series number five. Walker is a great insperation for our young people. There are never any bad words or sex in them. I just love watching him fight the bad guys. Good always wins over evil. I am collecting all of the series. This is one show the whole family can watch.,1211068800,6,344,4.2272727272727275

In real life, Chuck Norris is a 6-time UNDEFEATED world champion, and he brings that same spirit to Walker, Texas Ranger.

He proves again and again that the finest virtues of the human spirit are alive and well in all of us, and that if reach out to that, there's nothing we cannot do. Chuck Norris really portrays the very best in all of us when he stands up for truth, justice, and the American way, one round kick at a time!",1320451200,,617,4.421052631578948

Watching episodes of Walker Texas Ranger with my (now) 16 year old sons is a high point of family TV enjoyement. Good does triumph over Evil. Crime does not pay. However I must disagree with the lady who said there is never any sex in Walker. There are not a few scenes inside of strip clubs with scantily clad young women swinging on poles, etc. Some seasons more so than others I guess... but you need to have the remote close by to zip though some scenes every now and then.",1215043200,,617,4.421052631578948

Not a mixup with Amazon's shipping by grabbing the wrong product for my order but a mixup with whoever actually made the DVD set in the first place.
