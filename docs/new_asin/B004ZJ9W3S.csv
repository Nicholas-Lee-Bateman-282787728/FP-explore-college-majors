4509046,3,B004ZJ9W3S,this is fair movie i mean it is not great it the kind of movies you see in drive- in cause the indoor theater would not touch it all and all it is ok but don't look for great,1332288000,,174,3.4871794871794872
4509047,3,B004ZJ9W3S,Good value for the money for 12 movies in all. A look back at some rare movies that will probaly may not be seen on TV anymore but are an interesting insight of that era and the stars that appeared in them in there youth.,1316304000,19,221,3.933333333333333
4509048,3,B004ZJ9W3S,"I know this pack hasn't been released yet, but I do know what you're going to find when buying this pack. From the 12 films there are only 5 films that hadn't been released earlier, the other 7 films were all released before by Millcreek entertainment on their ""32 Drive-In Cult Classics"" a movie pack that is still available.

Perhaps, the quality of the 12 films here is improved since it's just two movies for each DVD side as opposed from the 32 drive-in pack which had from 2 to 4 films per side making quality poorer at times.

Worht buying? I don't know, unless you're a collector you will probably find it interesting to add this pack to your personal library, but  if you're only interested in the 5 films released for the first time it might also be worthy, since Millcreek packs are the cheapest around you won't miss much of your precious benjamins.

I as a B movie fan & collector, expect to get the 12 movies on great image & audio quality as most of the 12 movie packs released earlier by Millcreek.

The 5 movies that are first timers here are: The Virgin Queen of ST Francis High, Sextette, French Quarter, Yellow Har: Fortress of Gold and Noon Sunday.",1310428800,59,1169,4.44392523364486

8449881,4,B004ZJ9W3S,"Dangerous Babes is another ""Themed"" 12 pack of movies by the ever popular Mill Creek Entertainment.  This one, like their Big Screen Bombshells film set, is centered around low budget, woman oriented films.  And most aren't that bad.  I do recommend this one.  If only just because many of these are pretty good for Low Budget",1405123200,,326,4.767857142857143
8449882,3,B004ZJ9W3S,"Massive collection of bad movies (but some that you can get a kick out of) that are in very good shape, although the aspect ratios are all over the place.

At its bargain-basement price it's hard to go wrong, but I already owned a lot of these on other collections.

""Blue Money"" is to me the best of the dozen films collected here. It's genuinely an interesting little film about the early days of the pornography industry and it's  well-acted. I was impressed and it held my attention, unlike many of the others.

""Click: The Calendar Girl Killer"" is a strange stalker flick pretty typical of the genre, although its inconsistencies are at times laughable. Attractive chicks, that's a plus.

""French Quarter"" is about a cute stripper who travels through time, or something like that. The strippers in this film don't show it all, and the acting is pretty terrible.

""Hot Target"" feels older than it's 1985 release date and involves a rich wife's infidelity with a bad guy.

""Night Club"" is just a weird, weird movie--the weirdest of the lot (and that includes ""Sextette""). A guy opens his own night club, gets tangled with some baddies, invents an affair with a hot fantasy girl (or is she real?) while he tries to hold things together with his wife (or is she real?). I didn't get it, but I did enjoy the too-infrequent nudity.

""Noon Sunday"" is an action pic with lots of fights and explosions,  and one full-frontal scene with a hot assassin chick.

""Separate Ways"" is a pretty forgettable pic about a couple's unraveling marriage.

""Sextette"" stars Mae West, playing a sex symbol as usual, only by the time of release she was 85 years old and couldn't see or hear well enough to portray a piece of furniture, even if she did have the same skin and shape as one. It's a disastrous musical comedy but had a lot of big names--Dom DeLuise,  George Hamilton, Regis Philbin, Ringo Starr, a very young Timothy Dalton and on and on.

""The Sister-in-Law"" is the second best film of the collection and probably the hottest, with ample amounts of sex and nudity. It  will keep your attention with its interesting storyline about two brothers (the title is terrible and misleading), the younger who is a free spirit and the older who is  a writer of some acclaim who ends up getting himself mixed up in drug smuggling. The older one is married to a hot chick who pursues and then bangs the younger one; the older is openly having an affair  with a hot chick who also  ends up banging the younger one. Lucky guy.

""The  Virgin Queen of St. Francis High"" is in the vein of other '80s teen sex comedies except this one has no sex and pretty much no comedy. Low marks for this one.

""Weekend With the Babysitter"" will make you squirm a bit with the May-December romance between a much, much older man and a much, much younger woman. She's kind of hot; he's pretty gross.

""Yellow Hair and the  Fortress of Gold"" is the worst of this lot, an R-rated movie that is R-rated for no discernible reason.  And it's really hard to figure out because it's dated 1984 but looks more like it was shot in 1974, and also opens with some weird stuff that makes it appear as though kids are watching a matinee at a movie theater. Another bizarre inclusion.",1391558400,2,3231,4.542314335060449
