Also not as exciting or dramatic as I hoped when purchased the movie 2 weeks ago.",1406764800,,114,4.2272727272727275
5379569,4,B00A2UUWT2,"Unbelievable as it might sound, this one has a plot. SS camp commandant's obsession towards one female prisoner lead to his own downfall. Plenty of young naked women along the way. The actresses are very pretty in the 1970's all natural kind of way & the movie is quite beautifully filmed for its budget. The interrogation scenes & sex scenes are very tame compare to other movies of its kind from the same period. You'll get more action by watching Basic Instinct. Full Moon's DVD release has clear & sharp picture in widescreen format which is a surprise for B movie like this one. Not to mention this is not a DVD-R at a rather low price. Although not a movie for everyone, all in all it's a good Full Moon DVD release. 4.5 Stars for the quality of the DVD & 3 Stars for the movie itself.",1382659200,4,791,4.351351351351352
5379570,1,B00A2UUWT2,"What a waste of time, and money. First the picture: no one can tell if it is black and white, or color movie, because the entire movie is so dark, shaky, and awful unclear. And it was the most stupid movie I ever seen. All women are ugly, except for two female officers they were just average. There are some nudity but because the movie is so dark, and unclear like some one soaked it in bleach before putting it on a disk, you can hardly see anything. And in my personal opinion if I brought any homeless man from the street to direct this movie, he will do a better job than the stupid Italian director, and the same for photographer ( what an idiot).Second the location: There were only about three locations to photo this movie and they were all in underground basement with any sacrifice to put any light so we can see the movie. Third: the acting, there did not have any talent, jut people standing like statues, and saying what they been told to say.  Finally if you like to have nerve break down, and feel so stupid. then buy this movie, and you will curse Amazon, and you will wish that you can sue them not for your money, but for the aggravation you will get from watching this major stupidity.",1380326400,,1206,4.312775330396476

8546328,4,B00A2UUWT2,"A Full Moons Grindhouse release of Rino di Silvestros 1976, Le deportate della sezione speciale SS or SS Special Section Women (video title). As you might guess, this movie fits the overall sexploitation genre, yet it remains a relatively original (for the time) combination of WIP (Women in Prison) and nazi-sexploitation sub-genres. Please, take my words with caution; however, this is likely one of the most well achieved sexploitation entrances when it comes to the main characters and script. The story is simple, and where women in Nazi-occupied countries are packed onto a train and shipped off to a prison camp, where the sadistic commandant (starred by John Steiner) takes the very best and uses them as rewards for his lesbian guards and perverted and deviate troops. The twist here comes here with the commandant who gets obsessed (in love?) with one of the inmates (played by Lina Polito), something that causes his downfall. The movie still has some nasty scenes, a good dose of naked women, but overall it falls short in sex and gore, so be warned those who expect some more along these issues.

Technically, this is a full-screen enhanced for widescreen TVs DVD presentation. The movie is region free (0), offered with English audio, but no subtitles. Extras include a Grindhouse Featurette of interest to fans of these flicks. Contrary to what Amazon lists associated to this title, the movie runs for 91 (not 98) minutes approximately. Given that IMDB informs a total feature length of 98 minutes, I assume this is not the original totally uncut version. In fact, the 91 min length on this current version matches the version sold in Spain entitled as Las deportadas, so that is not an alternative to get a more complete version.",1454457600,9,1746,4.938775510204081
8546329,4,B00A2UUWT2,"One of the better of the Nazisploitation genre... Not a lot of depraved violence as in several of the films that were made during this period... Plenty of nudity, and lesbian encounters... even, God forbid, a brief homosexual encounter... The acting is pretty decent, even being dubbed in English... the picture quality and cinematography is a bit dark at times, but that just adds to the mystique of the grindhouse experience... If you are expecting a masterpiece film, you are looking in the wrong place... this is for those who are into the cult/grindhouse genre that are favorites of filmmakers like Tarantino and Rob Zombie...

Deported Women is a 1976 erotic-drama film directed by Rino Di Silvestro. The film is considered the first Italian nazisploitation film, after the ""auteur"" progenitors such as Liliana Cavani's art film The Night Porter and Tinto Brass' exploitation film Salon Kitty.

In Nazi Germany, a group of female prisoners are transported by train to an SS concentration camp and subjected to torture and sexual depravity by the camp commandant (John Steiner) and his guards.",1449964800,2,1098,5.128491620111732
8546330,4,B00A2UUWT2,"I believe the title alone should set appropriate expectations for the viewers of this film. Given the genre this film is up to ""B"" movie, Nazi exploitation film standards. Lots of quality shower scenes with attractive women, a paper-thin plot and the always reliably repulsive Nazi bad guys to supply the evil intentions. Thumbs up for me.",1439078400,2,339,4.964912280701754
8546331,4,B00A2UUWT2,"This film is allot of fun, the story is silly and just gets sillier as the film goes on but I love it. I don't know if they intended to make fun of the SS as much as they did but by having a really effiminent corporal in charge and of course loads of lesbian sex its just funny. And the camp, man i wish it went like this the prison seemed to be really easily to escape from its silly grind house fun with lots of girl on girl and nudity some gore and silly situations. Hell if the real camps were like this hardly anyone would of died in the real WW2. One odd thing was that the prisinors didn't have the star of david on there shirts like they did in the real hollicaust but they all had the pink triangle",1435190400,3,707,3.9166666666666665
