This is the best of the Chekhov filmed plays, though i think AC only really works in the theatre. But it's still well worth having,

With Chekhov pulling the strings and Max Adrian, Fay Compton, Rosemary Harris, Laurence Olivier, Joan Plowright, Michael Redgrave and Sybil Thorndike acting the roles, you will never see, never hear, never feel, never endure a better Chekhov production than this. Never.

THE GUARDIAN, 5/18/15
MICHAEL BILLINGTON:

Laurence Olivier wasn't exactly famous for his generosity towards rival actors. But even he was moved to write in his autobiography that Michael Redgraves Uncle Vanya was the best performance Ive ever seen in anything. Olivier may, of course, have been swayed by the fact that he himself directed this renowned Chekhov production at Chichester in 1962-63 and played alongside Redgrave in the role of Astrov. But Im tempted to agree with Oliviers verdict, and anyone who wants to make up their own mind can catch Redgraves performance in the production on DVD.

I had been fascinated by Redgrave long before his Uncle Vanya. I had seen him play Hamlet, Antony and Benedick on stage, and been mesmerised by him on screen in movies such as The Browning Version and Dead of Night. No actor was better at portraying divided souls whose intellect and emotion always seemed to be engaged in furious conflict. Only years later, when reading Alan Strachans marvellous biography of Redgrave, did I realise how much the actors capacity to play tormented figures was connected to his own bisexual nature.

Even with Uncle Vanya, a 47-year-old hopelessly in love with the beautiful Yelena, Redgrave brought out the characters split personality. With his floppy hair and absurdly large cravat, Redgrave looked like a tousled adolescent waking up in middle age to the fact that life has passed him by. Redgrave also captured the key fact about Vanya (and many other Chekhov characters): that it is possible to be comic outside and tragic inside.

There was something ridiculous about Redgraves moony infatuation with Yelena, yet the moment he caught her in a passionate embrace with Oliviers Astrov and offered her a bouquet of exquisite, mournful roses was enough to break the heart.

The high point of Redgraves performance, however, came in the great scene where Vanya explodes with rage at the Professors plan to sell the estate and makes to shoot him. Redgrave was brilliantly reduced to babbling incoherence as, contemplating his wasted life, he cried: I could have been a Schopenhauer, a Dostoevsky. Yet the despair elided into farce as he took a pot shot at the Professor and missed. It is all there in Chekhovs writing, but what Redgrave caught sublimely was the violent oscillation of Vanyas mood swings, and his recognition of his own futility.

Ive been lucky to see many fine performances of the role, including Simon Russell Beales at the Donmar Warehouse and Roger Allams more recently at the Minerva, Chichester. But if Redgraves remains the benchmark, it is because he caught to perfection the essential Chekhov quality of what-might-have-been.",1432944000,10,3120,5.105882352941176
8590512,1,B00D80GLI4,I should have known not to get this. I've never liked the works of Chekhov. But Sir Laurence Olivier enticed me to buy it. I found the movie to be true Chekhov. The acting was very good.  A group of dysfunctional people thrash around bit and form two groups of dysfunctional people. If there were any redeeming changes they were too subtle for me.,1421971200,,347,4.421875
