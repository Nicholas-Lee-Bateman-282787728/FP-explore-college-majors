Be aware that this movie has no English subtitles. But if you're using it as a Japanese study tool, it's worth noting the Japanese subtitles have hiragana guides written above the kanji, which is nice!",1512691200,,281,4.62

8198252,5,B000R17JKQ,"Yes, the movie is from Japan, so it is entirely in Japanese. Having studied Japanese though, it wasn't that big a problem for me, as I could mostly follow the plot. There are no English subtitles but again, this is directly from Japan, not America, and in Japan English is a second language. That said, you will also need either a region-free DVD player, or a Japanese DVD player to watch this. It was not released in America due to the smaller popularity of the franchise here versus Japan where it has a much larger fanbase. If you love Animal Crossing, this is the series that would become it. It started off as Animal Forest (doubutsu no mori), and this movie is based off what at the time was the most recent- oideyo (come here), which is known as Wild World in America. Crazy cute storyline between Ai, Bouke, and Sally who all become friends, and set out on an adventure together. Ai first meets them while working for Tanukichi, after setting off on her new life in Animal Village. If you know Japanese, and love Animal Crossing, this is totally for you.",1445990400,,1062,4.507772020725389
8198253,4,B000R17JKQ,"This movie is really cute (considering I'm an avid Animal Crossing player lol)! Unfortunately, it doesn't have any English subtitles (I'm learning Japanese, so I obviously don't know enough to fully understand what they are saying). Luckily I heard that there are a few online with subtitles, and I'll be watching it there.

Another thing is that it wouldn't play in any of my DVD players at my house or at my friend's apartment, but it did work on her laptop (that's how we found out about no subtitles).",1431993600,,505,4.674157303370786

8198255,5,B000R17JKQ,I recomend For hardcore Animal Crossing Fans. (WARNING: Movie In Only Japanese Language),1407715200,,88,5.846153846153846
8198256,5,B000R17JKQ,"This movie is very cute! I'm sad that it wasn't popular enough to be released in America, so when you watch it, you can't have English subtitles. Also it requires a ""Region Free"" DVD player.  Other than those few obstacles, this DVD is amazing and i'd definitely recommend it to any Animal Crossing/Nintendo fan!",1392768000,,312,4.777777777777778
8198257,4,B000R17JKQ,"I expected this item to have English subtitles, but it didn't. My friend and I found a version online with the subtitles to watch first. We still love it because we're huge Animal Crossing fans (we've been playing the game since GameCube's version hit the USA) and we plan on watching it when we have Animal  Crossing days together.

The story line is really cute and we fell in love with it. Definitely will watch over and over.

The company I ordered from was very quick to ship. They told me it would be 4-6 weeks to get to my house and it got here in 3, so I'm very satisfied with them.",1391126400,,590,4.20353982300885
8198258,5,B000R17JKQ,"I've always been a fan of Animal Crossing and this movie is a wonderful representation of the game! It's extremely endearing.
Plus, with my order, I got a small pouch for my DS/3DS. It's so cute!! I really couldn't be more happy that I bought this!",1390953600,,248,4.413043478260869
