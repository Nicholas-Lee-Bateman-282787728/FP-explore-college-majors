8166111,5,B0000Z0I5W,this movie is a bonus video included in the Last Detective Complete Collection.  I thought this movie was better than the series.,1481587200,,129,4.863636363636363
8166112,5,B0000Z0I5W,"Leslie Thomas proves that you can create a telemovie that sticks to the original story and still produce something that retains its atmosphere and the characters, something that the later series doesn't quite manage.
The choice of Bernard Cribbins and Bill Maynard as Dangerous and Mod is spot on and the supporting cast are just as good. The script did not detract from the humour and pathos, the suspense and the levity that make Thomas's portrayal of his flawed hero and those around him so interesting, including his love/hate relationship with his dog. Location shooting in the novel's setting added to the atmosphere of the time and place to create a believable film.",1305763200,3,673,4.964601769911504
