8703542,5,B00TZE3WEI,"The Gaiam yoga for athletes series is fantastic! Only 20 minutes a workout, I don't feel like the Tin Woman anymore and look forward to a gentle day. It would be a good idea to know some of the basic yoga moves like downward dog, cobra, warriors, and triangle. Kent's voice and instruction are soothing and clear. And I love all the athletes! I've been doing these almost daily for 6 months and am over 55. I often modify the pose, so as not to injure myself. Highly recommended!",1518566400,,479,4.393258426966292
8703543,5,B00TZE3WEI,This video is a hit with me and my son. We are able to do these exercises together and have fun doing them. The fact that it is a professional athlete doing the exercises helps my son to want to do it more often. All blocks of exercises are basically 20 minutes which is rather easy to do morning or night. It provides a good workout in a short time.,1515801600,,350,4.014285714285714
8703544,5,B00TZE3WEI,"I'm a yoga newbie but I know what I like. These routines are challenging and well taught at a good pace for someone who is athletic but has limited experience with yoga. The instructor walks the athlete through the poses and corrects when necessary.

I have tried others in the series such as with Jones, and George. This one seems to be the most challenging in terms of strength and flexibility required.

As an aside it also makes you realize how big these ball players are. Stanton almost dwarfs Kent.",1499472000,,504,4.588888888888889

8703546,1,B00TZE3WEI,Very boring.  This was purchased for my 11-yr old son because he LOVES baseball.  Giancarlo Stanton rarely speaks in the video and nothing is explained as to why they are doing these exercises.,1476748800,,193,4.818181818181818
