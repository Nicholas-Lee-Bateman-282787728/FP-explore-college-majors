7800649,5,1629972290,"I homeschool my kids and I have a few pre teens that I purchased this for. The lessons are short but efficient. The little booklet that serves as a text book is also concise. This really helps keep the kids interested in learning. They don't work well on their own, but they're perfect to supplement existing coursework. This particular course is pretty interesting and it covers different information from all genres and subjects. That is why it won't work on its own. If you have existing courses and you're organized, you can easily pull up the menu and hit play for whatever subject you want to cover. For example, in our computer class we discussed binary briefly - then we watched the segment on the dvd. Very neat.

He is always trying to get the family to watch his documentaries and shows but we always get bored half way through. This dvd was very informative and kept my family interested. My husband LOVED it. Awesome thanks!!

The Professor has a excellent way of making the lectures entertaining and easy to understand. The book that comes with this goes more in depth and explains the theories, has a glossary of terms and charts to explain how things work.
I am very pleased and it's fun to see my husband truly enjoy and learn more about things he enjoys.
This is a 4 dvd set of lectures and would be awesome for kids and adults alike to dive more into the sciences. I think it would be nice for teachers as well to have on hand.
Good job Professor on making such an interesting and understandable lecture for anyone.
