8093265,1,B000BVM24A,This is one of the worst insults to gay movies that I have ever seen.  Never mind the swishy stereotypes and white trash stereotypes and machismo stereotypes.....Believe the one and two star reviews here.  This film is horrible...with some of the worst acting I've ever seen...particularly the stupid lady who plays the host of the TV show.  Just horrible.,1264291200,,356,5.0
8093266,4,B000BVM24A,"I'm not a fan of reality television.  And here's a movie that takes the reality television concept and twists it into an enjoyable experience.  I think when reality TV has run it's course, and I hope it won't be too long, people will look back and think what the heck was that all about?  This film will stand the test of time and we'll look back and say, not everyone got caught up in that crap.  I loved the costumes, I don't know where they could have found those clothes.  The characters are wacky and funny.  I loved Malcolm's practically catatonic mother.  She was probably the only sane character trying to come to grips with a world gone mad.  I couldn't take my eyes off of her.  In conclusion if you hate reality TV you will like this film.",1195862400,,750,4.338129496402877
8093267,1,B000BVM24A,"This film encases a plot that is absolute genius......... had they been serious about it. Instead the retards that wrote this manage to insult gays, straights, family, reality tv, society in general, the President and even Jesus, in about the sickest way possible. Furthermore, they thought it would be funny. Well in all seriousness it would have been a funny, dramatic production had they made a serious movie about a straight guy pretending to be gay and marry a gay man in order to win a million dollars. That's the whole concept around which they promoted this production. What you REALLY get is a stupid, off the wall, sarcastic, skit very similar to something you would find on Saturday Night Live, on a bad night. I would LOVE to see someone with ability take this concept and DO IT RIGHT! If you've read the descriptions of this film, what you read is awesome. It is not what you get. This thing makes Lucy and Ethel look serious and dramatic. Rick Federman is hot and would have been perfect (with a well written plot) for the part of the straight man. In fact, Sandon Berg would have been good as the gay guy in a serious dramatic role without all the hideous nerdy, flaming queen overkill. Picture quality and sound were good, casting was good considering the roles being cast. This film was a cheap shot at anyone and everyone, including the viewer for being stupid enough to be duped into watching it. I was not at all impressed but highly challenge someone REPUTABLE to remake this film into the masterpiece it could have been. I am so very disappointed!",1160697600,2,1569,4.627240143369176
8093268,1,B000BVM24A,"I loved ""Gone, but not forgotten"" and couldn't wait for the next Michael Akers film.  But this film, ""Matrimonium""  is just plain awful.  The idea is great, the execution of it was unimaginable.  The host of the reality show was wooden, the ""gay guy"" is the steriotypical gay guy (lisp,flighty. The gay guys family are rednecks, they cooked possum for dinner!  This movie insults the south, the gays, the straights, and somehow they even insulted the reality shows.  This movie is not funny and it actually took two tries to get through the bad acting to finish seeing this movie.  Don't waste your money.",1149206400,,605,4.759615384615385
8093269,2,B000BVM24A,"""Matrimonium"" is one of the most obnoxious and campy films I have seen. The storyline could have been very creative and entertaining with major adjustments and recasting. First a new TV Show Hostess who was much more believable and realistic would have been required. Deven Green as Andre, TV Show Hostess, lacked substance and appeal. Joel Bryant as Bradley DuBois, best friend of Malcolm Caufield (the straight guy desperately searching for a quick buck) was my favorite character and the most believable. A good concept gone sour!",1141603200,2,533,5.137931034482759
8093270,2,B000BVM24A,Looks like someone shot this with a home video camera. I got through the first 5 minutes only. I don't have a problem with low budget but this was beyond any means of that.,1138492800,,172,4.088235294117647
8093271,2,B000BVM24A,"I am not sure if the cheesy overall quality of the movie 'Matrimonium' was intentional or not.  The dreadful, over exaggerated hosting by Deven Green as Andre, the TV show hostess, and the unrealistic gay lisp of Shandon Berg as Spencer made the characters not all that funny or believable.  If the film was intended to be tongue-in-cheek then I might, and that's a big might, understand why the movie was created and released for actual viewing.  I was not impressed, yet as corny as it was, the better acting ability and good looks of actors Joel Bryant as Bradley, and Rick Federman as Malcom, kept me watching.  The idea for this film, spoofing reality TV shows which the film strongly resembled aspects of television's 'My Big Fat Obnoxious Fianc' with a gay twist, was a great idea.  I really wanted to like this film.  'Matrimonium' could have been extremely funny if some of the writing had been better, the directing and editing a little more like real television in certain scenes and the acting, on the part of a few, more believable.  Regardless, I imagine all the people involved in making 'Matrimonium' must of had a fantastic and funny time creating the film.  This is just one guy's opinion.  I support independent film makers, so go and watch 'Matrimonium' yourself, you might really enjoy it.",1135900800,2,1310,4.761061946902655
8093272,4,B000BVM24A,"I saw this film at the Philadelphia Gay & Lesbian Film Festival this summer, and it was a great big hit.  I really don't think it's a gay-interest film, however.  Instead, it's a 'general audiences' film that happens to have a gay element, like ""My Best Friend's Wedding"", and many other recent films.

It's a take-off on the reality TV rage that's taken over television.  Even the format of the film is drawn for TV, because the film unfolds in half-hour 'episodes', complete with intros and outros...it's just like watching the complete season of a TV show on DVD, one episode after another.  Anyway, the cast is bizarre and odd, and just right.  Sandon Berg delivers an endearing performance as the center of the mayhem, and hunky Rick Federman succeeds opposite him.  There's a surprise twist at the end which I won't divulge, but it comes from a surprising person, and provides a nice reality check.

Michael Akers' direction is smooth and brisk, as it should be for this type of lark.  Kudos to United Gay Network for producing a film that strives beyond the narrow market of 'gay interest'.",1134000000,10,1097,4.731578947368421
