3441035,5,B0019MFY3G,I have been waiting for this DVD ever since the series aired over 20 years ago on PBS.  I have been shocked that there have been no re-runs on PBS of this series portraying the contributions of Robert Oppenheimer to the development of the A bomb and his political punishment for working against the Hydrogen bomb.  Oppenheimer is one of the most remarkable people of the 20th century and this DVD demonstrates the political price he paid for opposing Ed Teller and the other war mongers after 1945.  I can't wait to see this again.  I believe that this was Waterston's finest role and makes his appearances on Law and Order pale in comparison.,1212883200,10,643,4.614035087719298
3441036,5,B0019MFY3G,"I saw this in high school, and was thrilled when it came out on DVD. Long unavailable it has been released for a new generation to view.

It is as strong as I remember it being, and the trials of the father of the atomic bomb were disturbing.

The politics of the bomb and its controversial use are explained. It is a drama, and shows how the government used and discarded Oppenheimer and the witch hunt of the McCarthy era. In one scene they say, ""If you were a British citizen, they would have given you a knighthood."" Well, the U.K. may well have destroyed Oppenheimer also. They certainly did a number on the man most responsible for defeating the Enigma machine, Alan Turing.

But it does show the rise and fall of Oppenheimer, and his redemption of his scientific career.",1158105600,,777,4.49645390070922

3441064,4,B0019MFY3G,"Fascinating story, well-depicted. Generally follows the path of documented research and is all the more fascinating for it. Have always enjoyed Waterston and this is probably his earliest work that I've seen. He doesn't disappoint.

This series is available on youtube, but the video quality is pretty bad (to say nothing of the ethical/moral issue from watching a freebie version of this copyrighted work.)",1414972800,,407,5.359375

3441066,5,B0019MFY3G,"great movie; they just skip the really interesting stuff like Oppenheimer being a full blown nut job. He tried to kill a teacher at Cambridge (Mommy and Daddy bought his way out of that one; as they were super rich) and later a guy he had a homo crush on.  I always wanted to know who really put Oppenheimer in that job. Whoever did it was a commie and very powerful. ""Oppie"" should have been hung as a Moscow agent; but he lived out his life in splendor as his type always does. His picture hangs in a KGB museum as one of the great atom spies.",1411948800,,545,4.093457943925234

3441069,2,B0019MFY3G,"I guess it's a good story... I don't really know yet, as I can't stand to watch most of it.

The movie started out ok, but then came the long segments of that greenish, low-light, crappy 'videotape' stuff.  I've never seen a mix like this, and I found it extremely distracting.  I thought I was watching an episode of Dr Who.  Does someone actually think the viewer can't tell the difference between real ""film"" and videotape? ( or whatever that stuff is).  Is this art, or just cheap?  I mean, what's the point of doing it that way?

The cinematography is as important as the story.  I've never seen a mix of styles like this, and I didn't like it. When I calm down, perhaps I'll get my $50 worth.",1402963200,,698,4.315384615384615
3441070,4,B0019MFY3G,"This is an old production made for TV depicting the career of the great scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer.  Considering when it was made the production at times is pretty sketchy.  It almost feels like watching a show produced in the 1950's.  I first saw this on, I believe, WUAB TV in cleveland OH in the early 80's.  As an engineering student at the time, I found it intruguing.  Now 30 years later I had been wanting to see it again and have searched for it for at least 5 years to find it at an economical price.

Waterston definitely carries the series.  There is decent acting by others.  After watching it again as an adult, I have to question the authenticity of the portrayal of characters.  The series made General Leslie Groves as a Buffoonish man who felt intimidated by the Genius surrounding him.  This General however was in charge of the project and it was completed in a timely manner.  He also was in charge of building the pentagon.  No small feat and I highly doubt either project was completed ""in spite"" of him.  I would guess he had his skills that the director of this series chose to ignor and had his insecurutues he chose to show.

Also, the depiction of the rivalry between Teller and Oppie is questionable.

All in all it was a good story with some question as to the real story.  A must see for anyone interested in the history of the A-Bomb.",1391212800,3,1370,4.4417670682730925

3441089,4,B0019MFY3G,"The British have a knack for making interesting play-like movies.  This is one of their best.  The horror of what these scientists are working on doesn't seem to dawn on them until it's too late.  They were so caught up in the discovery and science of everything, they seemed to not realize what it was they were actually creating.  Their reactions--especially Oppenheimer's--is very telling.  And then, of course, the good ol' U.S. government turns on them--damn politicians!  Lives and careers are destroyed but what's done is done and there's no turning back.  Regrets abound.

3441090,5,B0019MFY3G,"Sam Waterston and the rest of the cast of this mini-series give a riveting dramatization of the race to develop the Atom Bomb.  Full of personal and interpersonal emotion and intrigue, this series takes us inside the life of a remarkable man -- Robert Oppenheimer.  A haunting musical score contributes to the dramatic effect and sense of foreboding.",1359676800,,350,5.017241379310345
3441091,5,B0019MFY3G,"I can hardly hope to improve on the other reviews of this wonderful series, which is intelligently written and brilliantly acted. Sam Waterston is ideally cast as the complex, conflicted -- and ultimately tragic -- J. Robert Oppenheimer, who was a man of culture as well as of science.

A couple of examples: ""Oppy"" learned Sanskrit so he could read the Bhagavad-Gita in the original, and when he saw the first atomic explosion he thought of words from it: ""I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."" And he named the project Trinity after reading John Donne.

And the key to the man? Perhaps it was spoken by General Groves: ""Oppy's just a normal, ambitious guy like anyone else. But he's an intellectual. He has to have it sugar-coated.""

I saw this series recently for the first time in many years, and was again so overwhelmed that I scarcely know how to express my admiration for it. To give it only five stars is totally inadequate. If you've never seen it, do so. If you have, no more needs to be said.",1338336000,,1011,4.543956043956044
3441092,4,B0019MFY3G,"The other reviewers have pointed out the various strong points of this series, including Sam Waterstons' fine performance and the fact that they did give the viewer at least some idea of the technical challenges that had to be overcome, so I would like to bring forth some criticisms of this otherwise excellent production:
(1) Although the story takes place in America and deals with Americans, the fact that the production was made by the BBC brings forth the old anti-American stereotypes and Left-wing ""political correctness"" which are seen in so many British productions of the past decades. These include viewing Americans as being stupid (except for Oppie and his close, Left-wing friends), military and FBI people are ignorant and occasionally made to look like fat pigs, and the eventual dropping of the bomb is implied to be more directed at the Russians than at ending the war against Japan as soon as possible saving many JAPANESE lives in addition to those of the Allies.
(2)  Richard Rhodes in his excellent book on the development of the Atomic Bomb points out that Oppenheimer had a difficult childhood and as a young adult showed signs of mental illness, including a violent assault on a good friend of his and a need for psychiatric treatment.  I think that this should have been pointed out in the program becuase it sheds light on his later reckless behavior.
(3)  Although it must be pointed out that the series does show that Oppenheimer gave a lot of ammunition to his enemies, it is still implied that the anti-Communist concerns of those investigating were due primarily to ""hysteria"" and not to real worries about Communist infiltration. Subsequent to the making of the series, the Communist bloc collapsed and a lot of new information came out which proved that Julius Rosenberg was indeed a Soviet agent, as was Alger Hiss, and that the USSR did mount a massive effort to infiltrate American government and the military, so it was not just ""paranoia"" on the part of the spy-hunters that was motivating them.  However Isidore Rabi's point that the US had built up a large arsenal of atomic weapons under Oppenheimer's direction would seem to indicate beyond a shadow of a doubt that he was NOT a traitor, as even his biggest rival, Edward Teller testified, in spite of his supporting removing his security clearance.

My favorite scene in the series occus in the final episode where the hearing is being conducted on whether to remove Oppie's security clearance. Brilliant physicist and Oppie's close colleague Hans Bethe is called to be a character witness. He says something to the effect that ""Oppie is the most loyal American I have ever seen"".  Attorney Robb who is acting as the prosecution (even though this was not supposed to be a trial, but rather a hearing) then takes the floor and asks Bethe how many different departments there were at Los Alamos during the war. He answers and then Robb asks ""which department did (Soviet spy) Klaus Fuchs work in?"". Bethe answers ""mine"". Robb says ""no further questions"" and then you can see Bethe's jaw figuratively drop to the floor. Touche!",1313280000,,3119,4.875471698113207
3441093,4,B0019MFY3G,"I have just watched this series on DVD: although over thirty years have passed since I saw it on TV and I have read a lot of physics and history since then, I am still impressed. Not only a beautifully controlled story allowed to develop at a pace that lets us explore the characters in depth, fine acting and excellent location filming, but also an appreciation of both Oppenheimer and his milieu that is true to later research, up to and including Bird and Sherwin's ""American Prometheus"".",1298764800,,491,4.655172413793103
3441094,5,B0019MFY3G,"One of the better and longer movie series made on JR Oppenheimer's life and career. The seven hour series covers 'Oppies' life from teaching theoretic physics at Cal-Berkeley in the late thirties, through loss of his AEC clearance and position in the 1950's. His participation in the Manhattan project (Atomic bomb) was well covered.

This BBC production is not a Hollywood version of events and his life, it is a more intimate view of Oppies personalty and relationships. The technical side of the A-bomb development is covered with just enough detail to understand his role in its success, not dominating the biography.

This epic was enjoyed more by reading ""American Prometheus"", Bird and Sherwin's Oppenheimer biography.  The books details all of his life and validates the movies portrayal of factual events. A fuller epic would have covered his youth, troubled and phenomenal genius.

Sam Waterstons physical likeness to Oppie made his characterization a joy to watch. BBC productions have a talent for creating historic atmospheres and the 40's were presented as authentic and believable. The movie was enjoyable as biography and history of a great American scientist persecuted for having a conscious, redeemed at last as a hero.",1255478400,2,1238,5.237373737373737
3441125,4,B0019MFY3G,"Circumstances led security forces to suspect Oppenheimer as the source of the breach. They were looking in the wrong place. The video series gives a good representation of this compelling story of the creation of the first atomic bombs. Consider for further study the following:
book and film: 'Enola Gay;' book: 'Making of the Bomb,' Roades; movie: 'Day One,' which follows Roades' story. A recent book: 'War's End' by Gen Chuck Sweeney gives the story from the point of view of the pilot who delivered the second bomb.",1252886400,,520,4.920454545454546
3441126,5,B0019MFY3G,"President Harry S. Truman once said that the only thing new in the world is the history you don't know.

Seven years before Richard Rhodes' superb Pulitzer Prize-winning ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"", the BBC produced a seven-part miniseries, ""Oppenheimer"", that was a character study of the people who designed and built the weapon that ushered in the Atomic Age, permanently joining science and technology to the state (and, in particular, the military), not merely making history, but changing the world forever.

The production is impeccable, the casting nothing short of miraculous; not only the main characters, but even secondary characters bear uncanny resemblances to the persons portrayed.  In particular are Sam Waterston in the title role of American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, scientific director of the Manhattan Project, who was based at the Los Alamos, NM, laboratory (the site for which he personally chose); Manning Redwood as General Leslie R. Groves, who oversaw the entire Manhattan Engineering District (the project's formal name); David Suchet as physicist, and ultimate nemesis of Oppenheimer, Edward Teller (who, nearly forty years later, whispered into Ronald Reagan's ear and brought us the Strategic Defense Initiative - ""Star Wars"") and Jana Sheldon as Kitty Oppenheimer.  The attention to detail is uniformly excellent throughout.

Part thriller, part love story - and ultimately a tragedy, this series faithfully recreates a chapter in world history - and that of science - that we dare not forget.  Highest recommendation.

(NOTE: Viewers who enjoy this series will also enjoy Jacob Bronowski's
13-part series ""The Ascent of Man"" and the BBC film of Michael Frayn's
play ""Copenhagen"".)",1232582400,3,1725,5.438202247191011
3441127,5,B0019MFY3G,"I found the movie very exciting. It involved a combination of scientific, political and emotional factors that were portrayed in a realistic manner during the years of the atomic bomb development.

The backlash of special interests was portrayed toward the end of the movie when his opponents conjured up a scheme to undermine his loyalty to the United States because of a technical error on his part. He opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb. These hearings occured during the post World War II era when McArtheyism ruled over the United States.",1227571200,,553,5.010869565217392
3441128,5,B0019MFY3G,"It certainly took long enough to get this wonderful program on DVD, but it was worth waiting for. The casting of Sam Waterston in the miniseries was brilliant, and his performance was the best I've ever seen him give. The supporting cast of mostly unknowns added to the performance quality. This DVD is one of the top five in my collection.",1227398400,,340,4.590163934426229
3441129,5,B0019MFY3G,"I am a chemistry teacher and have been wanting to show this series to my classes FOR YEARS. Finally, I can. It gives wonderful insight into the minds, egos, politics and brilliance of the men and women at Los Alamos. Sam Waterston does a hell of a job as the mercurial Oppenheimer. The story also gives insight into the strained relationship between the military and the civilian scientists imprisoned on a mesa in New Mexico.

3441130,5,B0019MFY3G,"The first time I saw this miniseries was so long ago that I recorded it on beta tape. When the beta machine finally was on its last leg I transfered it to VHS at an appreciable loss of video quality. For years I looked for a release on DVD and finally got on the wait list here at Amazon a couple of years back. Well, the wait was finally over and it was well worth waiting for. I have the book Oppenheimner and the miniseries follows it nicely. The acting is excellent, the settings are very well done (typical BBC) and the quality of the DVD production is great. It is definitely a great addition to my video library. I highly recommend this video to anyone who is interested in Oppenheimer, the period of history surrounding the development of the atomic bomb and the politics associated throughout this period.",1224547200,,814,4.469798657718121
3441131,5,B0019MFY3G,"A great, detailed and fascinating retelling of how a maligned genius was able to lead and focus some of the greatest applied physicists into building two completely different atomic bombs. Oppenheimer is sometimes dismissed by some circles as not really the father of the atomic bomb. Surely, there were others in the group of scientists who were higher order of geniuses (David Bohm, Leo Szilard, Eugene Wigner, Otto Frisch, Rudolf Peierls, Felix Bloch, Niels Bohr, Emilio Segre, James Franck, Enrico Fermi, Klaus Fuchs [Soviet spy] and Edward Teller [father of the fusion bomb]). However, how many of them could corral these brains and focus them like a laser beam into creating workable bombs (material and ignition). You really feel for the period as well including all the commie bashing (rightfully in some cases but pure red menace scare in many others).",1223164800,,861,5.113475177304965
3441132,5,B0019MFY3G,"2004 marked the Centennial of Oppenheimer's birth. The release of this title on DVD is long overdue, and will provide a complement to the recent publication of the first 3 full length biographies of Oppenheimer, by a spectrum of recognized authorities in the field

J Robert Oppenheimer: A Life by the physicist Abraham Pais, who has previously done books on Einstein and Bohr,
J Robert Oppenheimer and the American Century by the historian of science David Cassidy who has done a biography of Werner Heisenberg,
American Prometheus by 2 prominent historians of the Bomb and the Cold War, Martin Sherwin and Kai Bird.
The science writer Jeremy Bernstein has a new book, Oppenheimer, Portrait of an Enigma, which was a previously unpublished, extended magazine profile.
The Cold War historian Gregg Herken has also contributed a volume on the Brotherhood of the Bomb( Oppenheimer, Lawrence and Teller).

  Lastly, the papers presented at the Oppenheimer Centennial Conference held at UC Berkeley in May of 2004 have been collected and published, as have several more recent analyses of the Oppenheimer security hearing(by Richard Polenberg and Priscilla MacMillan,respectively.
A play, In the Matter of J Robert Oppenheimer( also the title of the actual published transcripts of the security hearing) based upon the hearings, originally performed in the 1960's, is being revived off Broadway this year.

  With all of the aforementioned renewed interest in this brilliant, complex, and controversial scientist, who ushered in the atomic age, and later became one its most important philosophers, we now have a long awaited DVD issue of this dramatic series, based upon the book( or perhaps vice versa) of Peter Goodchild: J Robert Oppenheimer: Shatterer of Worlds. This was a joint production of the BBC/WGBH ( fitting, as was the Manhattan Project a joint American/British effort ), starring Sam Waterston as JRO. Although the script took some liberties with dialogue, it was for the most part accurate, both historically, and, insofar as was possible, in that it was dealing with a subject based upon still classified material, scientifically. It alludes to a large FBI file on Oppenheimer, which I believe was becoming more available at the time of production, and an invaluable source for historians.
The 7 episodes follow Oppenheimer from his Berkeley days to Los Alamos where the bomb was built and tested, to Princeton and Washington,where he held court after the War, as the director of the Institute of Advanced Studies( where he was Einstein's boss)and a consultant to the AEC as the nation's premier advisor on atomic energy, through the beginning of his exile following the stripping of his security clearance. The drama is especially good on both the deliberations of the Interim Committee, which discussed the possible uses of the bomb once it was to be finished, as well as the Security Hearing which led to the stripping of Oppenheimer's clearance. Notable performances are given by both Sam Waterston, as Oppenheimer, and Manning Redwood as Groves. David Suchet is also memorable as Edward Teller.
I trust that Amazon will be dying for you all to run out and buy the books mentioned above, as well a other videos associated with this topic:

The Day After Trinity: a documentary history of Oppenheimer and the Bomb
Hiroshima: Why the Bomb was Dropped an ABC News Documentary very well done by Peter Jennings
Lifting the Fog: The Bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki

These feature the contributions of prominent historians/biographers such as John Dower, Gar Alperovitz, Samuel Walker,William Lanouette, and perhaps the world's foremost historian on the Atomic Bomb, Barton Bernstein of Stanford, who's lectures were a model of precision, clarity,nuance, comprehensiveness,and expertise, which captivated me during my senior year in college, and still do to this day.

There is also a forthcoming documentary from the BBC. Hiroshima

Hiroshima: a 3 hour dramatic film which is Japanese production focusing on both the historical events as well as the American and Japanese deliberations from the death of Roosevelt to the Japanese surrender in the wake of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Day One: a TV movie based upon the book of the same name by Peter Wyden. It begins with Leo Szilard taking the last train out of Berlin and shortly thereafter conceiving the idea of nuclear fission/chain reaction while watching light signals change as he crosses a London street, and ends with Oppenheimer addressing his colleagues about the necessity of post war control of atomic energy, and the dangers of nuclear proliferation. This is currently unavailable, but I can recommend it as worthy of being issued. Particularly good for the reactions of Chief of Staff Admiral William Leahy and Supreme Allied Commander Dwight Eisenhower to the bombings, even though these later writings or interviews are moved into the context of the immediate aftermath of the bombings.

I would recommend these outstanding sources of information and commentary especially in the wake of the shameful episode involving the cancellation of the proposed Enola Gay exhibit at the Smithsonian in 1995. What was intended to be a thoughtful exploration of the questions, issues, and events concerning the end of the war and the atomic bombings of Japan, which degenerated into a one sided, grotesque shouting match directed at the historical advisory committee to the exhibit, by the Air Force Association, a lobbying group which purported to represent the sensibilities of WWII veterans who they claimed thought the exhibit to be disrespectful to the memory of their service. One can make up one's own mind on this question by reading the proposed scripts of the exhibit( which the AFA demanded be suppressed), as well as a history of the controversy written by it's curator in the following:

3441133,5,B0019MFY3G,"I was lucky enough to see ""Oppenheimer"" when it was first broadcast on PBS, and have been checking Amazon literally for years, patiently waiting for it to be released on DVD (I think I pre-ordered it five years ago).  Now the wait is over, for one of the great film dramas is about to hit the shelves... and I'm sure it will fly off the shelves as it should.  The question is:  Why has it taken so long for this amazing production to be released on video?  Where has it been all these years?  Well produced and exacting in detail, accuracy and drama, this story of the ""father of the atomic bomb"" is grips the viewer from the first few minutes to the last episode. Of course, we've all seen the famous footage of the Trinity test (over and over), but this film tells Robert Oppenheimer's story so well, it looks like the test footage was made for this film, rather than the other way around.  The final episodes of the film well illustrates the heartbreaking and tragic end of the great physicist's career.  Public television should have rebroadcast this wonderful program long ago.  Let's be thankful it is finally available to the general public on DVD.  Kudos to the producers and to Sam Waterston - for turning in the finest performance of his career.",1214179200,7,1255,4.542222222222223
3441134,5,B0019MFY3G,"The recent release of the 1976 Adams Chronicles on DVD left only the release of Oppenheimer to complete the bifecta of the two finest dramatic miniseries ever broadcast on PBS. This seven part series was originally filmed in 1980 as a joint BBC and WGBH (Boston) production and was shown over seven consecutive weeks beginning May 11, 1982 as part of the PBS program American Playhouse. It depicts 15 years in the turbulent life of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who died in 1967, at the age of 62, but whose life and career remain controversial to this day. The story begins in 1938, when Dr. Oppenheimer was already recognized as a brilliant theorist in both particle physics and astrophysics (he was co-author of a prescient paper, along with graduate student Hartland S. Snyder, developing equations based on Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, demonstrating the possibility of a star collapsing in upon itself and forming a black hole). Together with Dr. Ernest Lawrence, Oppenheimer had turned the University of California at Berkeley into a renowned center for teaching physics. Sharply played by a distracted, self-absorbed and often edgy Sam Waterston, Dr. Oppenheimer is portrayed as a somewhat vain and preening professor, surrounding himself with an adoring clique of occasionally shallow yet brilliant students. He almost unconciously flits through 1930's left-wing circles, never seeming to land anywhere. Fascism is on the rise in Europe and Japan, and the Communist Party is in the vanguard of what the script labels - somewhat ironically given Stalin's immanent pact with Hitler -  as 'uncompromising opposition'.

This period will prove to be the source of his later difficulties, especially his troubled affair with the Communist Party member Jean Tatlock, as well as the left-wing affiliation of his brother and sister-in-law. Oppenheimer always refused to join the party, expressing doubts about life in the Soviet Union. Oppenheimer eventually heads the Manhattan Project, the crash program to develop an atomic bomb, which was successfully exploded in the New Mexico desert in July 1945. After the war, Oppenheimer was a chief advisor to the newly created United States Atomic Energy Commission, using the position to lobby for international control of atomic energy and to avert a nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union. He angered many politicians with his outspoken political opinions during the McCarthy era. Eventually, he had his security clearance revoked in a much-publicized and heavily politicized hearing in 1954. In that hearing, the lukewarm endorsement of Dr. Edward Teller, developer of the Hydrogen bomb, proved especially damaging to Oppenheimer. Teller's relationship with many colleagues was damaged, as well.

Waterston's performance as Oppenheimer is stunning: revealing subtle aspects of the physicist's personality that only a wonderfully realized performance can provide. His large supporting cast, playing the famous scientists surrounding Oppenheimer, is equally superb. Especially noteworthy is David Suchet (Poirot) as the complex, enigmatic Edward Teller, carefully avoiding portraying the 'heavy' or malign presence he might easily have become. Edward Hardwicke is Enrico Fermi, playing his brilliance with a touch of humor. Kate Harper is a poignant Jean Tatlock. Manning Redwood is Gen. Leslie Groves, the military leader of the project, in charge of a group of unruly scientists he regards as flakes, prima donnas and security risks. The entire ensemble cast is magnificent.

This seven hour series is one of the finest ever shown on American television. Our world was created out of these events, they are impossible to overdramatize. From science to world affairs, this series has it all. The events depicted here are enthralling. Most strongly recommended.

8274579,5,B0019MFY3G,Saw this when originally aired in early 80s.  Waterston is fantastic as Oppie and the rest of the cast is wonderful.  Great film to whet you appetite about the building of the bomb and its aftermath.  When you are ready to delve in deeper check out Herken's Brotherhood of the Bomb.,1501459200,,282,4.490196078431373

8274581,5,B0019MFY3G,"Excellent acting by all principals. Sam Waterston does an Oscar-worthy job of portraying an American scientific icon.  As philosopher/historian George Santayana said, ""Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.""  Would that more citizens of our country were aware of the political situation  before, during and after World War II, as told by this film.  Perhaps they wouldn't feel so powerless and express their dissatisfaction so violently as they do now.  Some of us need to help temper the vitriol that characterizes our times.  Recommended most highly..",1457654400,,577,5.355555555555555

8274583,5,B0019MFY3G,"An outstanding 7 part miniseries production done by PBS back in the 1980's.  Based on Peter Goodchild's book ""J. Robert Oppenheimer: Shatterer of Worlds"". Waterston's portrayal of Oppenheimer is riveting, some of his best work.  While a few historical liberties were taken, the overall story sticks close to the history of the Manhatten Project, as well as Oppenheimer's trials in the 1950's.  Oppenheimer was a complex man and this is reflected in the portrayal.  This production is from the era in which PBS produced quality dramas and shows (e.g. Carl Sagan's Cosmos) before it became the pale shadow it is currently.",1449792000,2,620,5.108910891089109
