8708214,3,B00USWVTTQ,"I agree with the previous reviewer. It is cheesy, campy fun. Bruce Li is fun to watch. And the music is laughable.",1466035200,,114,4.2272727272727275
8708215,5,B00USWVTTQ,Excellent and campy seventies Bruce Lee exploitation movie!!! All the Bruce Lee imitators are in it although Bruce Li will always be the best!! Picture wasn't too good but that's perfect because it adds to the fun grindhouse effect which works with it plus it was free so what can you expect?,1464566400,,292,4.634615384615385
