2599478,5,B000G27FEG,"I have watched this movie over 10 times over different media and finally, I decided I want this movie for my home collection. Its a very soft dignified romantic comedy, reminds me of lucknow and that soft romance UP style.
Extremly well written, directed and acted on by all players, its one of the best movie I have ever watched.",1294963200,2,330,4.516666666666667
2599479,5,B000G27FEG,"This is a very funny movie that can be seen by both hindi and non-hindi speakers as the movie works pretty well with english subtitles. It is a great movie to show to non Indian people as well because it shows a realistic version of India and it's humor is cross cultural. Very nicely done and well acted (which is not a typical feature of regular bollywood fare).  It is not slapstick but it is basically the neurosis of a simple man with a stunningly beautiful girl to deal with. It brings to mind the old song, ""When you're in love with a beautiful woman"" by Dr. Hook.",1157241600,,571,4.287037037037037

2599555,5,B000G27FEG,"This movie while very simple and something that we have seen many many times before in Bollywood movies wherein a short yet qualified middle aged man named 'Mithilesh' played by actor Rajpal Yadav who I remember most as this funny character from the movie ""Malamaal Weekly""and in this movie it shows his insecurities about his height and personality when he gets married to 'Veena' played by Rituparna Sengupta who is portrayed as beautiful wife in this movie who is slightly taller and superior in all respects. The movie takes a twist when she reunites with a handsome friend from her childhood makes him feel jealous and starts to doubt about his wife's behavior. Again the plot which we have seen so many times before in Bollywood movies. What distinguishes this movie from all other Bollywood movies of similar nature is excellent acting and presentation from the cast. The movie is well presented and enjoyable to watch. Rajpal's realistic portrayal of an insecure and self-conscious person is commendable. Five stars! This movie has English subtitles and a very nice movie to watch.",1449619200,2,1089,5.0220994475138125

8128773,1,B000G27FEG,"This movie is basically about a super petty, jealous middle aged man who marries really, really well. His wife is more educated, more beautiful, taller and overall could have done extremely better. Much, much better. But she settled because he treated her as a person, rather than just a trophy. Same damn trope. Overall his acting as a crazy, possessive, jealous man is super good- he does all the actions that a borderline abusive, controlling husband do. The plot here didn't really go anywhere, all you really see is this beautiful girl stuck with an unattractive older man who can't handle how good, how beautiful his wife is. He then isolates her from any men he views as possible threats, and tries to keep her as secluded from everyone that he can, including her childhood friend. Overall this movie is a mess. A total fail for women.",1471737600,,842,4.73469387755102
