The scenes that show the real fighting are very short and also one-sided. The majority of the scenes show something that are not directly related to the battles at all. For example, people in the factories producing war stuff. Another scene shows people cut down trees to build defensive lines.

You won't learn anything from this DVD. It's much better to read a book on this subject such as ""An Army At Dawn"" by Rick Atkinson.

I'm glad I borrowed it from the local library instead of purchasing it.",1342569600,,672,4.591666666666667
8327016,4,B001NH4CHQ,"Well made British documentary with healthy balance between re-enactment and documentary.  I would rate it much better than similar US-made documentaries (like Vicory at Sea), where re-enactments cget flat out annoying.  I like the details explained  and very appropriate footage.  Among the minuses... for some reason, parts of the movie  are pitch black.  Black where you can see nothing.  Yes, I understand everyhting about black and white documentary fils of WWII vitage, but I bet that this was some sort of unsucsessful night scene re-enactment that can be probably cut out.  I do rewcommend this movie to anyone interested in WWII history!",1315353600,6,645,5.254901960784314
