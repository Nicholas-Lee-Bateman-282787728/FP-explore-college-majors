2864691,5,B000REJO3S,"I own both of the TV Jukebox dvds by Tony Helsloot at World Nature Video.  Great variety of scenes.  There are 9 scenes to choose from with quality sound and video on all.  Very high quality and colorful.  Everything from aquariums, ocean, waterfall,  to a crackling fire in the fireplace.  I have numerous nature and relaxation dvds by many companies.  These are by far my favorites.  Their products are high quality and professionally done.  I highly recommend any of their dvds.  This one is a nice way to sample their high quality in many scenes for one low price.
Another feature is that after ten minutes they will loop and play continuous or all can be played continuously.",1383177600,3,680,4.686440677966102
2864692,4,B000REJO3S,"""Wish"" there was a fourth sound mode - Silence without having to turn the equipment sound off.  ""Wish"" the fire had rustic ""logs"" instead of manicured firewood.  But Ambient Jukebox 2 is well worth the money and is totally adequate ...",1371859200,,235,4.7073170731707314

8200037,3,B000REJO3S,Gave this DVD to my sis as stocking stuffer and she really loves it the only thing that we would have preferred was different music with each scene and choice to shuffle the music as I don't think anyone sits around all day watching it. It would be nice if that were possible.,1419897600,,276,4.226415094339623

8200040,5,B000REJO3S,"I love the different scenes in this DVD - it's such a variety and it really is enjoyable. As usual, the photography is excellent. From sunsets to waterfalls to aquariums with beautiful coral to a soft burning candle which is extremely peaceful, this DVD is great all the way through. I prefer the natural sounds, but the music is very good too. There's enough different films (9) to keep you interested and relaxed. I get these videos to decompress my stress and they do a very good job. I'll keep watching.",1414540800,3,507,4.582417582417582
8200041,5,B000REJO3S,"I am enjoying this DVD.  There are 9 different themed scenes to choose from and all of them are so beautiful.  I usually play all on loop function so every time I go into that particular room, a different scene is there for me to admire.  It is a great DVD to buy if you want multiple themes to choose from on one disc.",1414022400,2,319,3.953125
