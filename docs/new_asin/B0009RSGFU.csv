8065775,4,B0009RSGFU,"It  was a treat to actually view it ( this 2nd part ) despite the further confusion of the described contents of the movie were listed as Chapters 7 - 12. The initial confusion was caused by first watching the FIRST DVD , also called ""The Three Musketeers"" ( but that was NO indication mentioned that this was a ""part 1"", and NO warning mention of that was INCOMPLETE of that movie, and that it was ONLY Chapters 1 through 4 (ONLY ). I still am confused that was/is still NO explanation, if any exists, where and/or are chapters # 5 & # 6...  I agree with a number of reviewer-purchasers, about the marketed DVD #1, as that one was deceptively and described ( in the labeling ) when it was initially marketed. DVD #2 went a long way towards finally ""eventually acquire a complete movie"", to combine both DVDs.

It was a great way to view finally, an action-packed, and also containing wry humor passages, of an early year film submission, and see a couple of now-famous cast members too ( i.e. Lon Chaney , and Noah Berry, Jr ) listed too. Not a ""Classic"", per se, but still was a treat to watch it.",1389916800,,1099,4.325242718446602
8065776,4,B0009RSGFU,"Everything that you would expect in a western--the bragging, the shootouts, the fistfights, the outstanding horsemanship, etc., can be seen here. However, the setting is not the American West, but Algeria. Originally filmed in the 1930's, it features a young John Wayne. He is caught up within an Arab plot, the French Foreign Legion, and El Shaitan--a mysterious figure. Wayne is falsely accused of murder and gun-running, and is placed before the firing squad. The guns go off before the reprieve can be delivered. Is Wayne dead? See it and find out.",1214697600,2,552,5.010869565217392
8065777,4,B0009RSGFU,"If you have not seen the first DVD, with chapters 1-4, do not watch this one yet. It will make even less sense than it already does. This film is funny but confusing. Good guys act like bad guys, bad guys act like good guys, the heroine persists in running off into danger and getting captured over and over, the hero gets shot several times, and the end is surprising. Watch for the part where the food-loving German musketeer bops an enemy on the head with his sausage. It's got laughs, suspense, and adventure. This is a nice Friday night film. If you have three hours, watch both DVDs. Very entertaing!",1118448000,2,606,4.468468468468468
