This film has helped to highlight the movement witn examples and straight forward explanations. I have found it, when coupled with an understandingmof Ceznne's inventions,
most illuminating.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cezanne-and-Beyond-Philadelphia-Museum-of-Art/dp/0300141068/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cezanne and Beyond (Philadelphia Museum of Art)</a>",1308182400,,540,7.725806451612903
7908652,3,B00000G02X,"It is a segment of an 8-part series The Museum Without Walls presenting selected artistic and architectural achievements of the last 4,000 years on VHS and DVD. The Cubist Epoch is based on an excellent book with the same title, and it is narrated basically like a slide show with addition of period clips including the introduction, and with clips presenting critics speaking their analyses. The quality of picture is not great, and the sound is even worse, since the series was made in the early 1970s.
The very unique and only 54 min. long segment made in 1971 was filmed at the Cubist Epoch exhibitions in Los Angeles County Museum of Art held Dec. 15, '70 - Feb. 21, '71, and in The Metropolitan Museum of New York held Apr. 7 - Jun. 7, '71, and it depicts the art and artists of Cubism from its beginning early in 20th century. Cubism - for the first time - presented objects in an abstract form after an analysis and mental deconstruction - a significant achievement of art.
The Cubist Epoch segment - by Universal Education and Visual Arts - has the following three parts:
* The Beginning Years 1907-1910 (Picasso, Cezanne, Braque);
* Cubism Becomes a Movement 1910-1912 (Salon d'Automne - Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, Henri Le Fauconnier, Leger,  Delaunay, Andr&eacute; Lhote, Francis Picabia, Roger de la Fresnaye, Marcel Duchamp, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Chagall, Jacques Villon, Apollinaire, Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carr&agrave;, Klee, Franz Marc, Lyonel Feininger, Bohumil Kubista, Kasimir Malevich, Lyubov Popova, Piet Mondrian, Stanton MacDonald-Wright, Max Weber);
* Late Cubism 1912-1921 (Juan Gris, Jacques Lipchitz, Henry Laurens, Diego Rivera, Gino Severini, Johannes Itten).
The other 7 segments of the series are: Giotto and the Pre-Renaissance; The Greek Temple; Goya; Germany-Dada; Le Corbusier; Picasso: War, Peace, Love; and Crete and Mycenae.

Narrated by Barry Sullivan
Between the years of 1906-07, young Pablo Picasso abandoned his once melancholy style to produce a work so outrageous that one critic likened it to a field of broken glass. Picasso's striking interpretation of a temptation scene in a Barcelona brothel, Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, marked the onset of the Cubist movement.
By the end of the decade, a new generation of adventurous young artists had emerged to follow in the footsteps of Picasso and his Cubist compatriot, Georges Braque. Echoing their society's newfound obsession with science and technology, the Cubists presented their world in a manner that had never been seen before.
This motion picture, based on an exhibition originally shown at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, studies with rare sensitivity the works of Picasso, Braque, Gris, Leger, Gleizes, Villon, Delaunay and their followers.
Underscored with commentary by authorities on the artists and their work, it offers a comprehensive survey of almost all of the significant art of this important movement, shedding a fascinating new light on the short but turbulent Cubist Epoch.
Museum Without Walls has been called a ""splendid art course for art majors, artists, or just those who would like an introduction to the great world of art."" Each film in this fascinating series examines its subject from a perspective found only beyond the walls of a museum.
Other films in this series include: Picasso: War, Peace, Love; Goya; Crete and Mycenae; Le Corbusier; The Greek Temple; Giotto and the Pre-Renaissance; and Germany-Dada.",1194048000,2,3493,5.24865831842576
