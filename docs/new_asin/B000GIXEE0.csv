I found the movie to be little slow but for the first time directing I have to give some credit to Jason Yee.
I also found the actress who plays his girlfriend ""Gina""(Yuisa Perez)  to be a hidden gem and a extreamly hot chick. I think she shold be mentioned more in the plot.

I would advise to view the movie but for the hot chick and not the plot.

8133134,3,B000GIXEE0,"I have a great deal of respect for Jason Yee--not only for his hard storied martial arts career, but also for him having the guts to make his dream into a reality.  All too many times, we hear of the 'next big thing/martial arts star/action hero' but how often does a guy do it the hard way--literally making his/her own film!!  Jason made this film for 80,000 dollars--and it looks pretty darn good!  Good fight scenes, decent acting, and an appearance by Cung Le and Tony Todd('The Candy Man'). Great martial arts film on a budget.",1238457600,,533,4.53125
8133135,4,B000GIXEE0,"I just finished watching Dark Assassin and I was horribly dissapointed.  I was expecting a bit more, the cover is so cool I really thought it would be more action less plot.

I'll be honest, I am not happy with the majority of the fight scenes, and I didn't like the plot at all.  But what won me over was the speical features and learning how they made the movie and the effort they put in.  Jason Yee seemed like a really cool guy and very talented.  With more production time and cheorgraphy, it could of been amazing.  I give it 4/5, I would like to give it 5/5 based on work effort and budget alone, but I think 4/5 will reflect my full opinion more.

Warning.  If you find nothing respectible about other peoples hard work and effort to make a movie, and simply want to be entertained, I do not think this movie is for you.  As mentioned, until I saw the special features, I was not a happy panda.",1215129600,2,903,4.203488372093023
8133136,1,B000GIXEE0,"Jason Yee may be a great martial artist, but he is a horrible actor, writer and director.  The dialogue is dull and wooden.  The plot is almost nonexistent.  Even the fight scenes are poorly filmed.  This may be the worst move I've ever seen.",1172620800,2,242,4.431818181818182

for 80k$, which is like ""one promo"" for Hollywood movies this has

to be considered ""good"" considering/budget/and the cost of a average film.",1159228800,,201,4.882352941176471
8133138,4,B000GIXEE0,"I heard about this movie for a long time in the indie circuit and was happy to see it finally out. Jason Yee is one of my heroes in the martial arts world - he was champion of many international wu shu and kickboxing competitions.

For an indie action film that he produced on his own dime with his students, it was surprisingly good.  I love the guy's charisma and presence.  Wonder what a polished studio film could do for him...",1158278400,,431,4.296296296296297
8133139,1,B000GIXEE0,"Combine a Bruce Lee look-alike, cheesy rap music, strained dialog and kickboxing and you have a recipe for a rank martial arts movie you can't sit through.  It's nothing you haven't seen before and it's definitely not something you want to see again.  I rented this for free and I still feel cheated.  Gah!",1158019200,2,306,4.62962962962963
8133140,1,B000GIXEE0,This movie was stupid the story sucked and it was to slow paced for me. The acting is by far terrible no actor (if they call themselves that) here gave an effort to at least try. The action could have been good but Jason Yee held back alot in his fight sequence. If you've seen Ong-Bak and Tom youm goon you will not enjoy this film. Those film took action to a new level this movie took 20 steps backwards. And the sword fighting is stupid because I guess they decided to use real swords so they moved really slow when they came at each other. Please if you have any taste in movies what so ever do not I say again do not see this movie.,1157414400,,638,4.031496062992126
