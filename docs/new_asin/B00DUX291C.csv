5857020,4,B00DUX291C,"American Experience: JFK is, overall, a well-written, comprehensive, and poignant documentary of a President whose life and (especially) death have been heavily shrouded by myth and conjecture. President Kennedy is given a relatively evenhanded assessment, with an emphasis on the debilitating physical illnesses that he began suffering from an early age  Kennedy's struggles with illnesses and family tragedy only make his achievements as President that much more remarkable.  Rather than simply glamorize JFK, American Experience portrays him as a complex person who was both actively engaged in, but at the same time held hostage to, the turbulent political events of the Cold War and Civil Rights Movement.
  The end of this show however - and quite unusually for an American Experience show - leaves viewers with more questions than answers about Kennedy's death and legacy.  Perhaps this is the most sensitive way to handle President Kennedy's assasination, especially for a certain generation of viewers who remain haunted by the sudden death of a beloved President.  But to another, much younger, generation of viewers who may not be familiar with President Kennedy beyond the enduring myths, such an abrupt ending may seem somewhat confusing and even a little disappointing.  We may never know exactly what happened on that terrible November day in Dallas, Texas.  But that should not stop us, and especially such an esteemed show as American Experience, from
trying to offer some kind of clarity to those events.  For with clarity comes closure.",1384300800,35,1555,5.340163934426229
5857021,5,B00DUX291C,"I found it straightforward, fair, and balanced.

An American President, unfulfilled.

Clearly could have had a second term.

What if he had consulted Dwight Eisenhower, 1961:  ""So General, tell me about assaulting a beach ... "" Duh ...

Eisenhower, who knew something about invading hostile beaches ...

The program documented JFK's extensive drug addiction.  A president taking Nembutal, and amphetamines, and telling his private doctor give it to me because it feels good-- yes that is good reporting. We should know that.

I have watched the Reagan, TR Roosevelt, Nixon, Clinton, and other American Experience PBS the Presidents series.

With Nixon, 3 of the 4 hours was Watergate.

With Clinton, 3 of the 4 hours was Monica Lewinski.

I dreaded that 3 of the 4 hours of the JFK program would be devoted to idiotic theories about the assassination.  But only about 10 minutes of the 4 hours were on that tragic event.  It was very sensitively handled.

Those of us who watched it live that day, will see in this program, Jackie's red hat and coat, and remember that day.  We were spared further maudlin agony over that day.

Five Stars.",1384214400,37,1139,4.854166666666667
5857022,1,B00DUX291C,"This supposed documentary has a largely anti-JFK editorial bias. It includes a tremendous amount of criticism and even ridicule of Kennedy, and many conclusory accusations and characterizations by persons without firsthand knowledge, without specification as to their source. Some positivity is thrown in to give the bare appearance of fairhandedness, but it's obvious from the choice of words in the narration and by many of the commentators that the goal is to present a negative portrait of JFK. (E.g. ""Kennedy refused..."" ""Kennedy was unwilling,"" ""Kennedy finally..."", ""He probably wasn't as great as he appeared to be, but he sure felt that way."" etc. etc. throughout.)

The gist of the documentary is that Kennedy was an amoral, conceited, bumbling, gullible ignoramus who achieved almost no worthwhile accomplishments and whose positive aspects were entirely superficial. I would have greatly preferred something objective and unbiased, and a great deal more commentary from persons who actually knew Kennedy well (It's always telling to note who is chosen to speak THE MOST in a documentary -- If it's mainly persons who have no firsthand experience of the subject and who editorialize a lot, that's a sure sign of lack of objectivity.).This is unfortunately perhaps symptomatic of the heavy corporate influence over PBS.

Of course, Kennedy did not live to write memoirs or defend his Presidency, but some who would not dream of attacking the memory of any other veteran or person who died in the service of his country have no compunction whatsoever about attacking Kennedy with vague unsubstantiated statements or even outright fabrications (Or shoddily researched books and documentaries with nefarious agendas). The only thing more tragic than the cold blooded assassination of our President is the continued persistent assassination of his memory after his death. One wonders whether Kennedy would be the subject of such persistent attacks if, unlike some other leaders born to wealth, he had not devoted much of his energies towards peace and helping those who were not rich or powerful.",1384214400,23,2102,5.347432024169184

Joe Sr.'s sordid past is alluded to but not made clear.  There's not one line about Jackie's profound influence on the arts during JFK's time in the White House.  The Kennedy's shabby treatment of LBJ (Yes, he was uncouth and corrupt but JFK could have vastly benefitted from Johnson's decades of experience in, and influence with innumerable members of Congress.)

5857094,5,B00DUX291C,"Just caught this again last nite on PBS. `JFK' is a first-rate documentary, and to its credit, avoids conspiracy theories, partisan political debate, or the nuances of policy. Instead the program focuses on the man and his life, and gives a goodly amount of attention to his never-ending health issues. All this is only just: as the presentation points out, Kennedy represented a new trend of presidential candidate who is elected for personal appeal and qualities, not for abstract ideas or through the machinations of local party bosses. It's a trend that continues to this day. While 'JFK' doesn't whitewash the flaws in the man or the politician, it still must be considered a sympathetic portrait. There's not a lot that's new here, but there's not a lot that's wrong, either. It'll be catnip for fans of JFK and fascinating, if familiar territory, for history buffs.",1424131200,,872,4.97945205479452

Perhaps this was an editorial choice (to leave the viewer feeling much as the country did when he was killed), but I would have liked a bit more about the impact on the nation at the time (and, the impact overseas; there's some footage from Paris, but I would have liked to see more), as well as a deeper exploration of his legacy.

As someone who has watched a lot about the Presidents and their lives, I figured there was very little I could be shown that I had not already had some prior exposure to. Well, I am glad to say I was wrong about this particular work. In JFK, a lot of pain was obviously taken to really go in-depth with the Kennedy Family and how their respective family rose to such prominence in the political arena. It went in-depth with the father-figurehead Kennedy Sr. and this was actually refreshing to see how his persona had a critical role in his son's persona. Strangely enough, one interesting piece of information was left out-JFK's interesting dalliances with a famous starlet-but I guess the creators of the docu-seies figured it was ""old hat."" For me in particular, I found the explicit details of JFK's relationship with prominent civil rights leaders and the overall civil rights movement for blacks refreshingly honest. I never held JFK out to be Pro-Civil Rights (given the era) and this docu-series framed his interactions with MLK and the civil rights movement in honest perspective. (I would share more but I don't like spoilers in reviews.)",1417392000,,1243,4.786046511627907
5857101,2,B00DUX291C,"I've gotten tired of submitting my reviews to pbs.org because they apparently don't post anything that's at all disapproving or negative. This documentary is based on ancient misinformation that has been solidly replaced with a completely different story, and it's really a shame that pbs seems to be towing the same antiquated line without any nod at all to the 5 million pages of updated material released after the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992.

We now know that the CIA as well as the US Military orchestrated the Bay of Pigs invasion without the President's authority, in fact against his will, and hoped to create a ""justifiable"" excuse to launch an all-out nuclear war on Cuba and the Soviet Union, a war they were convinced the US could win. The CIA alone was responsible for the insidious plans to murder Castro using biological weapons as well as standard means. It is also now known that the CIA also attempted dozens of times to undermine JFK's attempts to secure a nuclear test ban treaty, and an arms reduction agreement with Khrushchev.

In fact JFK's presidency in the the end became a constant battle against the CIA, which was created by Harry Truman to have no congressional, presidential, or popular oversight whatsoever, and who ran amock around the globe with their personal agendas of terror. No wonder that Truman later listed the creation of the national security agency which became the CIA as his ""greatest mistake"" as President. Without oversight, that agency, now transmogrified into the NSA, is the all-powerful governmental force that actually runs the country...and no number of public votes at the polls are able to change that reality.

Very strange that PBS, once dedicated to supplying the American public with accurate and truthful information, now that it accepts paid advertising, has become just another media outlet subject to the censure and oversight of the uncontrollable governmental forces that call all the shots, whether we like them or not.

This production provides an entertaining substitute for reality, and for the many of us who would prefer not to have to face the truth, gives us good reason to go about our business unaware of where it is exactly that we are headed, and empowers us to marginalize anyone who doesn't go with the mindless flow.",1417392000,4,2342,4.9974358974358974

2. ""Nothing new""? I saw many wonderful films and photos of JFK which I had never seen. This is a rich visual collection.
That said, of course there are distortions and omissions. No documentary is a glimpse of untainted reality. All of them are a point of view telling. If you are too lazy to read and or/view many sources and to formulate your own point of view on a given subject then you may as well only seek out material which reinforces your own biases.
This film on JFK is a wonderful and flawed telling of a great story about a courageous man who exercised rigorous independence of thought; a man who raced with time to truly lead, inspire and make his mark on history. A perfect man? Hardly. I personally view JFK as the last president who truly lead this country in an independent style and against dangerous opposing forces. What other president in memory has actually come forward and accepted full responsibility for his mistakes? We have seen nothing but ""damage control"" since JFK was cruelly taken away from us. What others may view as reasons to dislike JFK I view as wonderful testaments to a fully human being, shaped by his own background and circumstance. His peccadilloes did not compromise his leadership. His wit, humor, personal drive, vision, courage and extreme intelligence are well documented here. His ability to sublimate his physical pain to his vision for himself and his country is amazing and to my knowledge unique to our presidency. Yes, he studied methods to project his desired image via the emerging medium of television. Though perfected since no other has used it to project such a powerful image of a real man/woman. I used to greatly admire JFK. This film helped me to love the man. Well done.",1415059200,5,1853,4.704615384615384

Ultimately, this documentary---which started out so well in Part 1---disappoints in many ways in Part 2, and in the final analysis, it is a cop-out, and a whitewash of the true back-story to the entire JFK Presidency: JFK's ""war"" with his own national security establishment.

First, the history of JFK's involvement in Vietnam presented in Part 2 is severely, and I believe intentionally, distorted.  While accurately stating that the size of the U.S. advisory force in South Vietnam increased four-fold in 1962, it did not state the alternate choice JFK was confronted with by his national security establishment in 1961.  The Pentagon, JFK's own national security council, and the hawks in the State Department insisted throughout 1961 that JFK commit combat troops to SVN; ultimately, in November of 1961, he refused, and instead decided to greatly increase the number of U.S. military advisors assigned to SVN.  The narrator stated at one point that the number of American deaths in SVN dramatically increased during JFK's administration, but DID NOT state the more important fact that the total number of U.S. deaths in Vietnam at the time of JFK's assassination was LESS THAN 100 MEN.  And most egregiously, the documentary did not even mention NSAM 263, issued by the Kennedy administration on October 11, 1963, which ORDERED that 1,000 of the 16,000 U.S. advisors be withdrawn by the end of 1963---and that ALL U.S. troops be withdrawn from South Vietnam by the end of 1965.  This document was declassified decades ago, so I can only presume that the writer's blindness was willful.  Furthermore, the ARRB, for which I worked from 1995-1998, located and declassified the full 213-page meeting minutes from the 8th SECDEF conference on Vietnam held in Honolulu in May of 1963, in which Robert McNamara ordered, and discussed in detail, the impending withdrawal of 1,000 troops by the end of the year, and the requirement to speed up existing withdrawal plans so that all U.S. forces would be out by the end of 1965.  This key meeting telegraphed JFK's revised policy on Vietnam to everyone in his government, and the signing of NSAM 263 on October 11, 1963 (by JFK's national security advisor, McGeorge Bundy) simply formalized what had already been ordered by the Secretary of Defense in May of 1963.  To summarize, the writer and the producers seem to have been intent from the beginning on reinforcing the tired, old, and inaccurate media assessment of the late 1960s and early 1970s---that JFK was responsible for our quagmire in Vietnam---rather than presenting any of the more recent scholarship of the past 22 years (such as that in John Newman's ""JFK and Vietnam"").  Lyndon Johnson (and Robert McNamara) were responsible for our quagmire in Vietnam, not Jack Kennedy, who rejected the strong and unremitting pressure to send in combat troops in late 1961, and who ordered the eventual withdrawal of all U.S. forces in October of 1963, just over one month prior to his murder.

Second, there were omissions and distortions in the coverage of the Cuban Missile Crisis in Part 2 of the program.  It was implied that JFK approved the dangerous (and unauthorized) escalation in the midst of the crisis when the Commander of the Strategic Air Command, General Thomas Power, placed all of SAC at DEFCON-2 without the approval of President Kennedy.  (DEFCON-2 was one step short of nuclear war, and JFK had only placed the U.S. armed forces at DEFCON-3, not DEFCON-2.  Power took this provocative step unilaterally, by transmitting 2 messages in the clear---unencrypted---which he hoped would provoke the USSR to take countermeasures which would have justified a preemptive nuclear first strike by SAC.)  In fact, the documentary did not even mention this dangerous action by the SAC Commander at all, but the narrator did say that JFK placed the Air Force on a higher state of alert, which was close to telling a lie, for to anyone at all familiar with the history of the crisis it implied that Kennedy had ordered the escalation in SAC's DEFCON, which most certainly was not true.  In actuality, JFK was furious about this unauthorized action by SAC, because it signaled escalation to the Soviets at a time when he was attempting to manage the crisis through diplomacy, and a blockade (in lieu of bombing and invading Cuba).

Additionally, although the program did play a couple of lines of Curtis LeMay's strong advice to JFK to take strong military action immediately to resolve the crisis, the most provocative lines spoken by LeMay---comparing JFK's blockade of Cuba and his use of diplomacy to the ""appeasement at Munich"" in 1938, and telling JFK he was ""in a hell of a fix""---were not played.  It seems the writer did not want to admit the serious level of friction that existed between JFK and the Pentagon during the Cuban Missile Crisis.  A significant part of this untold story was the post-Missile Crisis meeting JFK had with his Joint Chiefs, in order to thank them for their advice the previous 13 days.  Instead of accepting his thanks, the Joint Chiefs---CNO Anderson and USAF Chief of Staff LeMay in particular---churlishly raged against the President and insulted him: Admiral Anderson blurted out ""We've been had!"" and LeMay ejaculated ""This is the greatest defeat in our history.  We should go in and wipe them out today!""  But obviously, to relate these events would have been to admit that JFK really was ""at war"" with his national security establishment for almost his entire term (ever since the Bay of Pigs fiasco).

The narrator even seemed to provide an excuse for the bad advice the Joint Chiefs gave JFK prior to the Bay of Pigs (namely, that it had ""a fair chance of success""), by saying that they were just giving the CIA's operation a pass.  The narrator should have explained that when the JCS said ""fair chance of success,"" what they really meant was that the CIA's operation only had a 30 per cent chance of success.  In other words, they lied to the President in their evaluation.  Furthermore, JCS Chairman Lemnitzer had in his hands prior to the exile invasion an assessment that there would be NO internal uprising in Cuba after the invasion began, but he withheld this information from the President.

There was no discussion of the crucial Operation Northwoods documents (from the spring of 1962) located and declassified by the ARRB, which recorded the recommendations of the Pentagon's Joint Staff---heartily endorsed by the Joint Chiefs---that the United States employ PRETEXTS (i.e., official lies and provocations) to justify a massive military invasion of Cuba by U.S. forces.  JFK rejected the Northwoods concept in late March 1962, when JCS Chairman Lyman Lemnitzer attempted to resurrect the subject at an NSC meeting on Cuba.  The JCS response to JFK's rejection of Northwoods?  Their response was to write a blistering tutorial to SECDEF McNamara on April 10, 1962 demanding that the U.S. immediately invade Cuba, WITHOUT the use of any pretexts.  JFK's refusal of these two strong Pentagon recommendations to invade Cuba before the Missile Crisis, and his subsequent refusal to invade during the Missile Crisis itself, permanently fractured his relationship with the Pentagon and was surely ""the"" proximate cause of JFK's assassination.

His decision to pull out of Vietnam in 1963---telegraphed in May and formalized in October---angered the CIA as much as the Pentagon.

Nor did the narrator mention the account in Khruschev's memoirs that when JFK sent his brother, RFK, to see Soviet ambassador Dobrynin on Saturday night, October 27th, at the height of the Missile Crisis, that RFK told Dobrynin that there was increasing pressure to invade Cuba from the American military leadership, and that if the USSR did not agree to remove the missiles immediately, JFK might be overthrown by a military coup.  To mention this fact would have been to admit that there was serious friction between JFK and the Pentagon.

The narrator even mislead the audience about the U.S. Jupiter missiles in Turkey, which JFK secretly bartered in order to help persuade Khruschev to remove the Soviet missiles in Cuba.  First, the narrator said ""they had become operational.""  That is not true.  JFK recognized them as ""junk,"" i.e., unreliable and obsolete technology, and had previously ordered them removed.  No one had acted.  At the time of the Missile Crisis, only ONE of the FIFTEEN Jupiters in Turkey had become operational.  JFK did not remove them until about 6 months later, and did so ONLY AFTER a U.S. Polaris submarine with even greater striking power had been deployed to the Eastern Mediterranean.  There there was no strategic loss in that regard, at all.

Furthermore, the narrator never mentioned that the U.S. had a 17 to 1 advantage in nuclear weapons against the USSR at the time of the crisis, and an even greater advantage in long-range delivery systems (bombers and ICBMS)---and that JFK's biggest problem was in restraining the U.S. military, which wanted to invade Cuba and obliterate the USSR with a nuclear first strike.

One more example of an intentional omission by the writer was his failure to quote the most famous line of JFK's Peace Speech, namely, that the U.S. did not want ""a Pax Americana, enforced by American weapons of war.""  This line in JFK's speech was a direct response to an earlier statement made by Curtis LeMay in one of his own speeches, in which LeMay bragged that his bombers had created a ""Pax Atomica"" by frightening the hell out of the USSR.

Ultimately, though, the biggest failure of the entire documentary was its failure to deal with the assassination in any meaningful way.  At the very end of the program, it was simply stated that JFK was shot dead in Dallas, and everyone was sad, and grieved.  That was it!  there was no discussion of how he died (namely, in a hail of bullets fired at him in a military-style ambush in Dealey Plaza---the very definition of a conspiracy) or of the fact that there was a massive medical coverup of the details of his death by the U.S. government.

And the medical cover-up is a fact: many autopsy photographs known to have been taken are missing; 2 skull x-rays are missing; the three surviving skull x-rays are altered copy films (not originals); the first draft of the autopsy report, and the first signed version, are missing; JFK's brain is missing; and the brain photographs in the Archives today are not pictures of JFK's brain (for they have been disowned by the official photographer and one of the FBI agents present at the autopsy).  Instead, they are photos of a substitute brain, with an entirely different pattern of damage than that seen in Dallas.  The fraudulent brain photos in the Archives support the official cover story of a ""lone malcontent shooting JFK from above and behind.""

The simple fact is that JFK's life cannot be adequately assessed without discussing his assassination, and the ensuing cover-up by the U.S. government.  His death was not divorced from the policies he was pursuing---indeed, it was caused by the severe reaction of the national security establishment to the policies he was pursuing.  If re-elected to a second term, the changes JFK was implementing to U.S. foreign policy at the height of the Cold War would have become permanent---in fact, by the end of his second term the Cold War would have been moving toward an end.  JFK wanted to end the Cold War, and the national security establishment insisted on winning it.  They considered JFK a weak and misguided President, and feared the changes he was bringing about, and therefore cast a veto on his life.

By whitewashing and ignoring JFK's serious friction with the Pentagon and CIA, and the civilian hawks in government councils---by refusing to discuss his assassination and the ensuing cover-up, and the direct connection between JFK's policies and his death---the makers of this documentary have produced bad history.

I feel like this documentary does not fall into the trap of becoming a hagiography. However, I have to withhold one star because of the abrupt ending. The assassination is basically stated, then they declare that he could've been great, but we'll never know, and that was it. Lee Harvey Oswald's name wasn't even mentioned. Nor were we taken to Jackie's response, LBJ's (both the Civil Rights Act and Vietnam), or Robert Kennedy's.

Everyone should remember that the world could have been much different had a nuclear exchange occurred.  It didn't because Kennedy and Khrushchev were able to agree to remove the missiles despite both being advised to fire on the other by the respective military commanders.  Next, Kennedy called for the Mission to place an American on the moon.  While this occurred after his assassination and with, Congress funded because he convince us as Americans we could accomplish it If we set out to.  A lot of the technology we have today including the ability to type reviews on this website came from computer advances brought on by the Space program.  The Peace Corps and its creation also came from his leadership.  This film asserts idea that he didn't care about civil rights. As a matter of fact, Mr.  Kennedy gave a speech before his death which called for an end to discrimination on the basis of Race.  He also placed a personal phone call to Mrs.  King.

Something wonderful ended on November 22nd 1963, not only Jack Kennedy's life, but our sweet optimism. My generation still has faded memories of that America, but we were so young that it seems to us now as a ghost-like dream, a mental daguerreotype. By the time we came of age a decade or so later, this place was damaged - cynical and jaded. Maybe one day the United States will recover from what happened on November 22nd 1963, but I suppose it won't be until the last survivor with a conscious memory of those four dark days passes from the scene.

2013 has been a year filled with so many half-century milestones that it is difficult to keep track of them all. 1963 was indeed a year of historical landmarks - beautiful and not-so-beautiful. You know you're starting to get up there in years when you can clearly recall events from fifty years ago. I would only come to appreciate what a historical year 1963 was as I got older. From Civil Rights on earth, to the exploration of the heavens, President Kennedy's murder on the streets of Dallas, Texas fifty-years-ago today was merely the curtain closing on one of the most monumental years of the American Century. Wasn't that a time?

He still matters fifty years later. Jack Kennedy refuses to go gently into that good night.

Although the documentary repeatedly mentioned that JFK was not great by the standards that usually are used to measure Presidential greatness,  and this perhaps because his Presidency was cut short,  I think JFK,  although flawed, and despite the fact that his Presidency was cut short,  was a better President than many other Presidents we have had,  better than some Presidents whom the makers of this documentary would deem ""great.""

This documentary does everyone a service by covering the facts concerning the civil rights movement at that time,  including the fact that Martin Luther King,  Jr.,  and most other blacks were Republicans before Kennedy spoke up in their defense.  King and most other blacks became Democrats only because Kennedy,  a Democrat,  defended them when Nixon kept quiet and would not get involved.  (Also, the Ku Klux Klan was Democrat--perhaps most people don't know this.)  These facts are enlightening,  and should remind everyone to not put party over principle.  One of the things I most admire about John F. Kennedy was that he did not follow party lines just to follow party lines.  Very often he sided with the Republicans on issues.  He followed his conscience in those matters,  in spite of the fact that it infuriated Johnson and others in his party.

President Kennedy was more conservative than his party is today--perhaps more so than the Establishment Republicans of today, also.

I loved the way the documentary spoke of his health problems.  The man has my great admiration and sympathy for the way that he thought and worked in spite of this tremendous hardship.  Excellent documentary.  Heart-wrenching tragedy that he died.",1384732800,35,1749,5.049122807017544
5857152,2,B00DUX291C,"I was highly disappointed after viewing this on PBS the past 2 days.  The ending was a joke: first, he's in Dallas, riding in the motorcade, the VERY next scene is people hearing of his death on the radio.  I kid you not-- there's NOTHING here with any footage, audio, or even description of the shooting . . . NOR even a radio or TV interruption to say the president has been shot. Much less taken to a hospital.  Seriously!  Like they cut out a lot of footage with an ax to fit this into 4 hours.  Just 1) in a motorcade, then 2) dead. NOTHING in between!

That aside, more flaws: the experts were not very expert, instead they all had constant criticisms of JFK, two men in particular; and one woman calls the president ""Jack"" throughout, though she's a writer who appears not to have been born while JFK was alive.  They mention the death in a plane of his sister Kathleen (""Kick""), failing to mention her marriage to the Duke of Devonshire (which upset her parents on religious grounds) and that he was on the plane, too (all 4 occupants died instantly)-- just, ""his sister died in a plane crash.""  Why not mention these details over a period of say, oh, 5 seconds, and breathe some life and familiarity into JFK's sister?

The part on the Cuban Missile Crisis was poor, never mentioning a crucial detail occurring when the Soviets appeared to renege on what had appeared to be an acceptable offer to resolve the entire, mega-dangerous situation: how at RFK's suggestion, JFK agreed to the terms of the first (acceptable) letter from the Kremlin and ignored the second, much less cooperative, letter (that appeared to be written by Soviet hard-liners).  This omission was weak, very weak.  Again, how long would this have taken to include, 10-15 seconds?  Here again, it would have both made RFK more vivid and his relationship with JFK more clear, which wholly informs a biography of JFK.

I virtually always LOVE PBS documentaries, but this one was very weak, which would be particularly clear to people who have seen good programs on JFK previously.  Someone who knows little about Kennedy will like it, and will find it awash in detail, but there's just way too much that's missing for the informed viewer.  And it's poorly balanced.

A FAR better PBS production, from the 1990s, called ""American Experience: The Kennedys,"" is one of the most brilliant documentaries ever put together on any subject, in my view.  It covers JFK-- alone-- better than this one, much better, and covers the other brothers and the parents as well, again brilliantly.  I recommend that one most highly.  And INSTEAD OF this one.

This one, besides being horribly edited, is NOT an educational piece so much as a biased piece with a point to make: that JFK was a poor president who learned as he went along (don't they ALL, where's the news in that?), was a womanizer to the extreme (fine, but it didn't need to be stated every 10 minutes), who was pumped with drugs every day (again, fine to include, but repeated to death throughout), and whom the ""experts"" on the show (I've heard of NONE of them before except for one) either knew little about or needed to trash.  They had his SISTER, Jean Kennedy Smith on this program . . . and I believe they had her speak all of TWICE, or little more, in four hours.

This should not be anyone's intro to this president, nor does it handle any aspect of his presidency or upbringing in a way that adds to the body of knowledge of those of us who know something about the subject, which a 4-hour show should do; it's forever short on details.  And there's ZIP on the assassination-- by far the most examined murder in history, and one of the saddest and most shocking days in all of US history.  But to THESE film makers, apparently, merely a minute or two of at least the news coverage THAT DAY, Nov. 22, 1963 (with, say, Cronkite sadly announcing that the news was official and the president has died, or ANYTHING of this ilk) was not worthy of this program!  Seriously?  Material on the assassination just seems to me to have been, in all likelihood, inserted but then chopped out--TOTALLY, that's 100%--by a seriously unqualified editor.  Not asking for ANYTHING on conspiracy theories here or resolving the case; just please cover a few moments from the report of bullets fired at the president's motorcade, please.

I'd add, finally, that the anti-JFK bias of this program was very unusual for me to see in a PBS production.  Significant, clear bias either way would have been disappointing to me in a PBS documentary, and this had it.  For maybe the first time that I'd ever seen on PBS.  Then, a few days later, I viewed a 2010 PBS documentary, ""Nixon's The One: The '68 Election and How It Changed America.""  Sadly, the narration by Dick Cavett on that (presumably reading a script) was very biased against Nixon and was even--so unprofessionally--sarcastic, and though I'm not a Nixon fan, obvious bias makes a viewer wonder about the accuracy of such ""documentaries.""  Hence, my problem with the JFK program, which I'd guess dwelt on several negatives to provide the appearance of balance-- in lieu of being another loving tribute to JFK-- but which, to me, went overboard on the negatives.

-- UPDATE a day later -- I see that, already, two people have given this review a thumbs-down.  Since this review is detailed, heavy on facts about the program, and obviously would help ANY shopper considering this product-- whatever their political stripe, and whether one agrees with my opinions-- clearly this review has been voted down by some only because I like JFK, the person, and have pointed out why this broadcast is an overtly negative ""unbiased documentary"".  Hey, folks, if the review can help shoppers, you shouldn't knock it merely because it disagrees with your own like/dislike of the product, or your political beliefs. Lots of product info is included here, even if you disagree with my overall dissatisfaction.

In sum: a weak JFK documentary, and poorly edited.  Not recommended.  If there wasn't an abundance of better material on JFK out there already, I'd recommend this as opposed to nothing.  In fact, it's worth a viewing, I suppose, but I sure wouldn't buy it (intending to view it multiple times in the future, as if it's a key resource).

8598073,5,B00DUX291C,"This has to be one of the best documentary projects on Television that I have ever watched in regards to the entire life of President Kennedy.  I have seen others but some concentrate on details of his life outside of politics that give only a glancing looking into the political aspect.  Other, just the opposite, showing more politics than what the man was like in growing up.  This was delightful to watch, all four hours of these 4 episodes.  It covered everything in the life of this young president and I learned a lot about this man in seeing the complete aspect of his life and political career and how one affected the other.  Set to video tape footage, the sound track of this series was nicely composed as well.  The angles presented by Susan Bellow for American Experience were spot on I feel.  I can't say enough good things about this series.  I think that all Americans, especially in this day and age with the shape of this nation's political upheaval that we are experiencing should watch this series.  I found myself several times sitting here and saying to myself....my, what has this nation lost since President Kennedy was in office?  The fact that this man was one that compromised by having Conservatives in his office and taking heat from Progressives speaks volumes of what this man was willing to try to have compromise, real compromise.  And as the series concluded, I was left feeling like I had met the man and had come to know him.  Seeing the funeral footage stirred something in me and I was never more understanding of how good this series was to watch as an American.  Great Series, wonderfully directed and produced.  One of the better American Experience series.  Well Done.",1508716800,2,1710,4.691275167785235
