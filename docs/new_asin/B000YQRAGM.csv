8233831,2,B000YQRAGM,"Even though the show was about 10 yrs old, it's way too outdated. The info given in this DVD about what teens say and do is no surprise to any parent or kid watching it. The phones they show in the DVD are not the smart phones we are used to. The ""online chat rooms"" they show are no longer being used.",1502668800,,302,3.8870967741935485
8233832,5,B000YQRAGM,"I bought this hoping to be able to show my middle school students.  Although it was a great video, it was not appropriate for middle school children.  Perhaps it would work for high school.",1497571200,,189,4.529411764705882

8233834,5,B000YQRAGM,"Highly informative and engaging.  My students learned a lot. They especially enjoyed the skit involving random ordinary teens, which escalates into drama. Something they experience firsthand.",1400803200,,191,6.346153846153846
8233835,5,B000YQRAGM,Interesting coverage and very informative. I find it very fascinating finding out other people's reactions and actions as to whether they would involve themselves or keep to themselves.,1352678400,,185,5.642857142857143
8233836,5,B000YQRAGM,"This dvd shows how the internet, texting, messaging and other technologies can be used to bully others.  The main feature of this dvd is a controlled situation involving three groups meant to recreate some of the conditions in which cyberbullying takes place.  Though everyone participating in this ""experiment"" know that it is not real, the interaction between the groups and the hurt that occurs become very real.",1326844800,4,415,5.17910447761194

8233838,1,B000YQRAGM,"Way, WAY, WAY too much is being made of bullying lately. Back in my day (mid 90's) when we had issues with someone bullying us, we settled it after class. Settled it in the halls, on the playground, in front of school...whatever. We said our piece, made threats, sometimes we fought. We didn't need to shoot each other, we didn't kill ourselves because we were too emotionally weak to handle it. There is no nice way to put it...this generation is soft...plain and simple. The sooner shows like this that coddle the weak minded stop getting made, the better off you'll all be. Just deal with it.",1320364800,3,595,4.570093457943925
8233839,5,B000YQRAGM,"I am going to recommend this movie to our youth leader at our church.  This movie made such a loud and bold statement!  Emily did such a real performance here (totally got her out of the Hannah Montana mold!!!)  The makers of this movie told it exactly the way it is and left nothing for the imagination.  It is a heartbreaking story that makes you want to jump through the TV, it makes you cry, and it makes you open your eyes to the realness of this issue.",1311292800,11,458,4.170454545454546
8233840,5,B000YQRAGM,"Most all of us are aware of how bullying affects the people who bully others and even how people who are bullied react.  Cyberbulling takes bullying to a whole different level.  Where bullying is localized, cyberbullying is allowing the world to see its results.  It is one thing to experience the shame of being bullied in your own area, quite another when it is not only sent to cyberspace but commented on from the world at large.  It was amazing to see how the (apparently well rounded, popular, secure in their identity) teenagers contributed to cyberbullying via use of computers and cell phones.  If someone you know is not familiar with cyberbullying, this is a must see.",1298592000,7,679,4.769230769230769
