I don't usually write these reviews, but these four 3-D DVDs released from the Drive-In Classics 3-D collection are very special and deserve to be praised. Usually when people release 3-D stuff on video, its a gimmick to get you to buy it or it doesnt work very good. But the entire movie, the whole hour and a half on each of the movies in this collection are in complete 3-D, and the 3-D glasses included are really nice and classy, not the cheap kind found in other 3-D releases. I own all four of them, and I am going to write this review for all four of them, because they are my top 4 favorite 3-D DVD's that I own. Thank You Drive-In Classics!",1104883200,,709,4.107913669064748
