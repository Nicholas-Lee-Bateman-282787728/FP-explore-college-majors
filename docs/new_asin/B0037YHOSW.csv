8390866,5,B0037YHOSW,I am a long time fan of Baywatch. I love all the episodes. This set of Season 6 was great. But I had to buy a Multi Region DVD Player to watch it. Because it was not available for region 1.,1356912000,2,189,3.6341463414634148
8390867,4,B0037YHOSW,"I HAVE WARNED CUSTOMERS ABOUT BUYING FROM SOME OF THESE OTHER MERCHANDISERS. SOMETIMES WHAT THEY ARE OFFERING ARE SERIES RECORDED FROM SOME TELEVISION STATION WITH THE COMMERCIALS EDITED OUT. IF YOU ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO AT LEAST GET WHAT YOU THOUGHT YOU ORDERED, THE QUALITY WILL BE SO BAD: POOR PICTURE QUALITY, POOR AUDIO, MISSING OR CUT OFF CREDITS AT THE BEGINNING, MISSING OR CUT OFF CREDITS AT THE END. THERE ISN'T ANY LABELING, SO YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT/WHICH EPISODE YOU'RE WATCHING. SOME OF THE EPISODES ARE CUT OFF AT THE BEGINNING, OR AT THE END. SOME OF THE PICTURES ARE SO BRIGHT YOU CAN NOT SEE THEM. SOME OF THEM ARE SO DARK YOU CAN NOT SEE THEM. SOME OF THE EPISODES WON'T PLAY. THE PACKAGING AND ARTWORK IS AWFUL. AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON. HOW DO I KNOW THIS?! LAST YEAR I BOUGHT WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THE ENTIRE DYNASTY SERIES FROM ONE OF THESE BUSINESSES. AND WHAT I MENTIONED ABOVE IS JUST WHAT I GOT. THAT WAS THE WORSE $100 I EVERY SPENT. I STILL, TO THIS DAY, HAVE NOT VIEWED ALL OF THE EPISODES. THEY ARE JUST HORRIBLE. IF WHAT YOU ARE BUYING IS NOT BEING OFFERED BY AMAZON, THEN CAVEAT EMPTOR-LET THE BUYER BEWARE. AND THIS IS FOR ALL OF THE MOVIE LOVERS WHO ARE TRYING TO FIND THEIR FAVORITE MOVIES ON DVD: IF YOU ARE TRYING TO BUY A MOVIE ON DVD, BE CAREFUL. SOME OF THESE PEOPLE RECORD THE MOVIE FROM TELEVISION OR FROM VHS ONTO DISC AND SELL IT UNDER THE PRETENSE THAT IT WAS ALREADY MANUFACTURED ON DISC AND THEY HAVE ONE TO SELL. SURE, THEY HAVE ONE TO SELL, A BOOTLEG COPY. IF YOU CAN FIND NO MANUFACTURED SOURCE TO SAY THAT IT WAS AVAILABLE ON DVD, DON'T BUY IT, OR BUY IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. ONCE AGAIN, CAVEAT EMPTOR. THE STARS ARE FOR THE STORIES ON BAYWATCH. THIS WAS A PRETTY DECENT SHOW.",1311379200,6,1741,4.231231231231231
