By appealing to experts, Captivated builds a compelling case for why America needs less media. The video quality is excellent and complements the film's message.

4987665,2,B006GS7R1K,"I gave this film a couple stars for bringing up the important issue of how the media can be manipulative; but it falls short when it comes to assigning blame.
It's important to recognize that the so-called ""liberal"" media is actually a corporate media.  Most of our tv channels, radio stations and other outlets are big businesses and are sponsored by other big businesses.

4987670,5,B006GS7R1K,"The subject matter in this documentary is important for people of all ages, not just for our youth.  It is especially relevant for parents who are trying to navigate and regulate their children in the murky media waters that they are wading through on a daily basis.

This documentary examines electronic social media, the internet, video games, television, etc., and how all of it is impacting culture, social experiences and relationships, especially of our youth.  The perspectives and insights offered in the documentary are grounded in a Christian worldview, and echo many of my own concerns about this rapidly-evolving spiritual battleground.

Our battle is not against flesh and blood, but rather a struggle with the powers and principalities of this world.  In this day and age, perhaps now more than ever before, wisdom and discernment are necessary in order to be ""in"" the world but not ""of"" the world.",1350345600,3,912,5.093959731543624

I wish every Christian household would be able to see this film.",1332028800,29,452,4.8076923076923075
4987672,5,B006GS7R1K,"This documentary is excellent.  Videography was great and the overall quality of production was better than most produced by alternative media outlets.  I like that they had a wide range of interviews, from medical doctors, PhD social scientists and church pastors, to every day working folk, moms and dads.  The scenes for each interview were different, from academic office spaces to rural farmland.  This was great because many documentaries, in trying to come off as authoritative on the subject at hand, only interview people sitting in front of bookshelves full of books.

I was aware of books that went into the evils of TV--Plug in Drug (1988), Living Without the Screen (2008), to name a few.  Similarly, there is literally an endless amount of articles in scientific peer-reviewed journals that show why owning a TV is bad for your physical, mental and spiritual health.  But until I stumbled across Captivated last week, I was not aware of a documentary that did.  The only thing that came close was Alex Jone's, Fall of the Republic (2009), which devoted 15 minutes to how the government uses TV to propagandize its citizens.

The first half of Captivated--along with most of the extended interviews in the bonus features-- show how using TV, the Internet, ipods and smart phones dumb down the population.  Being hooked on these devices has turned Americans into a bunch of obese people with short attention spans.  Take a look around you: Americans no longer command their native English language, choosing instead to utter short phrases that they exchange in SMS, IMS or Facebook comments; no longer associate with neighbors or any other community, choosing instead to walk around with earbuds plugged into their ipods while they type meaningless messages on their smart phones.  Simply walk through a mall or ride a city bus and see how many people actually make eye contact with you or say ""hello.""

The second half of Captivated shows the Christian side of the producers.  Being that I am a born-again Christian, I thought this was great.  The producers showed why media and programming is bad for Christians, and that Christians need to moderate and filter through the bad media.  When compared to the first half, the second half of the film was not nearly as hard-hitting.  So while the first half of the movie made it very clear that using TV and all these gadgets is bad for your physical and emotional well being, the second half conveyed that it is okay for Christians to use these things, so long as they use them for good or wholesome purposes.  I fear this for two reasons.  First, there is little good use for these technologies.  Yes, using computers for work is fine, but as the doctors and scientists in Captivated demonstrated, people need to limit these things as much as possible from their lives.  I agree with these professionals, and from my own research, this means eliminating their use as entertainment devices.  Second, it is impossible for the Christian to find ""wholesome"" media programing.  My fear is that the Christian will see Captivated, and throw away their R-rated movies and exchange them for PG-13, PG or Disney.  But none of these are wholesome or good for the Christian!  Even PG and Disney will show fornication, adultery, relations between unmarried people, foul mouths, violence, children back-talking their parents, etc.  Being that 99% of entertainment is made by anti-Christians in Hollywood, CA and Orlando, FL, the Christian has to expect these things in all media programing.

My wife and I have been married for four years and during this time have not owned a TV, gone to the movie theater, used cell phones for personal use, or taken the ipod out of the house and car.  Most of the time we also had no Internet of our own.  During this time we managed to raise a son without a babysitter and daycare, work full time jobs, attend 2-3 church services a week, play outdoors, read countless books, exercise, and put her through medical school and me through undergraduate and now graduate school.  If you throw your TV in the trash, you will be amazed at what you can accomplish.  When people find out we do not own a TV, they respond, ""what do you do then?""  I find this question hysterical because my response to those that watch TV is: How on earth do you even find time to watch TV?

Lastly, buy this movie!  Watch it.  Throw away your TV and gadgets.  Read your Bible through at least once before you die.  Actually pay attention to your children.",1328745600,73,4513,4.80674448767834
4987673,5,B006GS7R1K,"I found Captivated to be extremely well done technically in terms of videography and audio qualities.  The story is well thought out and the premises made are laid out intelligently and very coherent.

While you may not agree with everything said, it will motivate you to think about and consider the important issue of media influence on ourselves and our families.  In particular, our children.  The producers lay out a convincing case that we are suffering from dogma out of Hollywood and that the damage to our lives are much more serious than we normally would think...as we glide through out lives without contemplation of the messages within those propagandistic media and their influence on us long term.

I highly recommend this film to anyone with mature thinking and contemplative of our existence and what helps to make the world a better place to live...or not.",1327795200,40,874,4.958904109589041

I certainly if I had children of my own as oppossed to the number loaners I had a long the way wouldn't be opposed to having them play a game of Grand Theft Auto than say actually commiting the act . This doc does play very well for all audiences and might speak to many on the Tech/Geek audience but also to a Christian Audience . If you fall into both catagories then this is a must see . If you are just one or the other however meh . Not entirely a waste of time but what exsactly are you doing on Amazon Prime anyway ?. Again I am now more than ever a spectator in the sport of the cyber arena due to unfortunate mishaps or intent and reviews and critiques are the most of my public cyber presence as I have dropped Social Media previous to viewing and more than likely due to ""dangers that were overtly made by media about the  usage of cyber and mobile and the paranoia it creates"".

Follywood is known for every kind of decadence in the world and the productions that they vomit out is nothing more than a mirrored reflection of what they have allowed themselves to become - which is EVIL. So plain and simple, this is a war between good and evil.  Who but devoted servants of God know more about Evil penetrating our world and interweaving its claws into lives, minds, votes and emotions of our children and most adults?  The unreasonable and the one's who don't know the things of God ALWAYS BLAME but everyone and everything else but themselves for not doing the right thing.  You have to be among the deaf and blind not to agree with the things discussed in this doc because they are PROVEN for generations to be true its just that no one stands up and does anything about it.  Contact Amazon and demand that they STOP buying the porn, filth, rape, murder, kidnapping dvd's that they have been forcing down our throats.

We miss out on real life relationships too. Just go in to any restaurant and look around. A majority of the tables have people all on their phones with no conversation being held.

4987717,1,B006GS7R1K,"People seem to be tripping over this thing, and while it makes many good points, I think most of it is nonsense. Before ""screens"" it was books, and before that it was drinking or a host of other things. The bible is full of warnings about idleness. The question then becomes, is it really the format that's wrong? Reading ""20,000 Leagues Under The Sea"" is good, but watching the movie is bad? Or does such a conversation merely cloud the issue? Could the real issue instead be peoples unwillingness to display self control? There is much to tempt us in this world, and if you totally cut out ""media"" are you now free and clear of vise? There will always be something! This is so silly. How can we expect our children to overcome their weaknesses if we keep rescuing kids from them? ""But solid food is for the mature, who by CONSTANT USE have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil."" Hebrews 5:14. If we can teach our children to use moderation not because we order it, but because our goal in life should be mastering our bodies (1 Cor 9:27), then we can truly help their future. Otherwise, these ideas are simply, ""Rules taught by men"" Matt 15:9. As soon as the kids move out, or the parents die, these issues will simply come back, in this form or another. If you warn someone of a trap, you save them one time; if you teach them to look for traps you save them forever.",1422403200,13,1382,4.40234375

If it were possible, a film like this should be given out at every baby shower in America because it alerts parents to the dangers, indoctrination, propaganda, and deception that awaits their children.  Some of the most profound and eye-opening observations come near the middle of the film when they discuss MTV and share quotes from MTV producers blatantly bragging about their mind control over children and teenagers.  I would also highly recommend you watch this WITH your family together and pause the movie throughout for discussion.  'Captivated' is one definitely for your library.

Note:  It doesn't stop at kids as you'll see in the film.  It clearly shows how adults are being manipulated by the rectangular box in the corner of the room as well.",1404691200,4,852,5.042857142857143

I was blown away by the facts presented in this DVD on how media is affecting our society negatively.  Prior to watching this DVD I had many negative feelings on the use (esp. over use) of media in my home and with my children whether it was for pure entertainment or educational purposes.  Watching this just confirmed my beliefs with documented facts that I had been on the right track all along.  I also was encouraged to read the book they mentioned in the movie ""Amusing Ourselves to Death"".  While I do not agree with this authors liberal beliefs he does present a clear case of how our society has been dumbed down in our communication skills specifically due to increased entertainment we immerse ourselves in by way of screens... T.V. to be specific.  I think every American esp. those that call themselves educators should be required to watch this.  I also believe every born again believer should watch this.  In the end it begs an answer to the question of what truly does captivate you and how do we preserve a society that is educated in truth and wisdom instead of just pleasure.",1399420800,8,1197,4.55607476635514

Pity, as (deliberate?) TV & video-game mind-programming of modern children, to turn them into entranced zombies, could be a much more interesting subject of a documentary.

My closest friend, yet I find it hard to go over his house and hang out because all he focuses on is the TV and the Xbox. Married and in our mid 30's, is this how we carry the torch of our forebears?

The film has excellent camerawork and caters to a Bible-literate audience (my non-Christian friends still enjoyed it).

My wife, teenage daughter and I found it to be an exceptionally well crafted film that reaffirmed and articulated our belief in the need to curtail our viewing experience.  To date we have done this and as a consequence redeemed the once occupied time in family, health and spiritually focused activities that has brought tangible positive changes to our lives.  By no means am I claiming that this documentary has solely brought about a familial transformation but rather it made an important contribution in generating the impetus to make the holistic changes needed to have a more free and enriching life.",1386115200,6,726,5.084033613445378

8497794,3,B006GS7R1K,"This program has some very good information, particularly in the first 20 minutes or so. The Christian slant, which becomes more fundamentalist and rigid in its message about thought-policing and judgments about what sort of ideas are ""righteous"" or ""godly"" for an adult to expose herself to as the program goes on, however, spoiled it for me. The problem of media overload, media addiction, and the impact of media content on the human nervous system, particularly that of the developing child, is very real and concerning--whether a person is a ""godly"" Christian, a Buddhist, a Muslim, a humanist, irreligious, atheist, whatever. There was no need to beat people over the head with the Bible to present a legitimate case in this program. There is also a difference between thought-provoking theatrical content and gratuitous or exploitative low-brow content. This program makes no distinction between the two and ultimately becomes a sermon by and for fundamentalist Christians who need to shield themselves from the big bad world. That said, I myself stopped owning and watching a TV years ago.
