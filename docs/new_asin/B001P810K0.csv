8332423,4,B001P810K0,"I discovered this title while looking up films of Allene Ray, serial movie queen of the silent era, whose career abruptly ended when her voice didn't work well with talking pictures.  I was surprised to find she was listed in a film from from 1949 but less surprised that the overacting, poor dubbing and stiff dialogue suggest an early sound-era effort, and that's what most of it is, started in 1930 but the money ran out.  The other three films written and directed by Jack Irwin were released in 1931, and while ""lost"" appear to have been low-budget ""poverty row"" westerns.

The plot has an unscrupulous and politically-powerful ship owner, Fredrick Winthrop, Sr. (John Ince), involved in gun running and in need of a replacement crew and captain over a disagreement as to whether his ship is seaworthy.  His son, Frederick Jr. (Robert Frazer) knows a recently commissioned captain, Jim Parker (Rex Lease) who is eager for experience.  Asked what might happen should Parker find out what was in the cargo, young Fred tells his father that as First Mate he could deal with the situation.  The crew is a miserable bunch that get along with neither the captain nor each other, and to make matters worse Parker's fianc&eacute;e, Helen (Allene Ray) gets on board, badly disguised as a boy assisting the cook (Gilbert Holmes), intended as comic relief.  And as might be expected, the crew mutinies, the ship gets caught in a storm and is sinking fast at the point where the finances did likewise.

Several years later the film was prepared for release by adding stock footage and some new scenes.  The MPPDA certificate, number 7209 would have been issued in 1941, but demand for the film was not sufficient until television became popular in 1949.  To complete the fragment that had been filmed, the story is told as a ""flashback"" with new footage having Parker trying to get his captain's credentials restored at a hearing of the Board of Inquiry, the chairman played by William Farnum, examining allegations of the former First Mate.  This was doubtless filmed around 1940, given Rex Lease's significantly increased girth.  Additional scenes were filmed to conclude the story, mixed with footage of the sleazy casino from the 1930 feature ""Hell Harbor"" that had previously been used in the Weiss serial ""The Black Coin.""  There are a few unusual plot twists and filler along the way, including one of Parker's companions at the casino (Smith Ballew) intoning ""I Dream of Jeannie with the Light Brown Hair"" (two stanzas!) in a place of such ill repute.

Sinister Cinema's release, from a 16mm print according to their catalog, is on a DVD-R, single-layer which should work on most players.  While Sinister does little in the way of ""restoration"" the image is fairly clean, with only a couple splices and adequate gray scale.  The sound is clear enough for something from 1930, and Allene Ray's voice seems to have recorded reasonably well, though it might not have worked on the sound systems used by theatres in the early 1930's.  The film will be of interest mostly to fans of ""poverty row"" films and the actors involved; it has some hilarious moments of badness, but isn't as haphazard as the westerns of Victor Adamson (who appears in a minor role) or Robert Horner.  Still, the strange plot twists and mismatched stock footage keep up the interest for its 49 minute length.",1386547200,,3378,4.855400696864112
