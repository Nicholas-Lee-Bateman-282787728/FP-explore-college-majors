8622196,3,B00GCVWU4U,"This seemed like a great idea: filming Britten's atmospheric, brooding Peter Grimes on the beach, in the sea-side environment at Aldeburgh for which it was written. The sea, sky and beach, combined with some brilliant computer-generated images, indeed give this film some swirling, scintillating sea-swept views, especially during the interludes (although these visions can be almost too brilliant, with too much an air of artifice). Still, you can practically smell the sea. With a stellar cast, led by an inward, Peter Pears-like Alan Oke as Grimes, and superb conducting from Britten specialist Steuart Bedford, this set seems most tantalizing. And the live performances at Aldeburgh Beach seemed to have wowed audiences.

But in spite of all these attractions, too much of significance is missing. One of the main features of the opera is the angry public, the mob of vindictive Borough citizens that makes the introvert Grimes feel even more the outcast, the pariah. Here, whether it is the lack of variety in the setting - a small boat turned on its side on a wharf-like structure along the beach - or the lack of texture in the placing, the movement of the townspeople, they do not give off nearly the unbridled contempt they should for Grimes. DVDs with John Graham Hall (as Grimes) at La Scala, Peter Pears with Britten, Jon Vickers with Colin Davis, and Philip Langridge with David Atherton, all convey the necessary nastiness of the mob. There the sense of fear is palpable; you can feel it in your gut. Here it is flat, a one-dimensional portrait of the townspeople, like a reading of the libretto, in spite of good acting.

The problems have to do with the medium and the staging. There is a strong theatricality to Peter Grimes that can come across effectively in a well staged production, which does not take place often enough here. For instance, Grimes's hut here is his upturned boat present during almost the entire opera. When the hut finally appears, it is fairly late in the opera (act two). The hut thus lacks a sense of surprise, of mystery and dread that it should have when the boat is seemingly always present.

Some of the problem is indeed, the setting. When you're always on the water, the scenes that are not on the water don't work very well. Director Tim Albery tries his best but is too constrained by being tethered to the sea. There is not enough variety in the settings to persuade in several scenes. The scene at the pub - on the wharf-like promenade - lacks conviction in its far from pub-like atmosphere. The Sunday morning church service - with a background of a black sky - simply does not work in the dark. I cannot suspend my sense of disbelief enough to be convinced. With much that is real here - lead by the forces of nature - this jarring juxtaposition of reality right next to unreality is too much to convince. This happens too often for credibility.

This DVD/blu ray lies in a middle ground, a no-man's land of mediocrity, concerning both worlds of opera filming. It has neither enough of the theatrical, dramatic sense of a staged production nor the realism of a good filmed version, the sense that this is taking part in the realm of everyday life. If it were filmed on the sea and in the town, it could have been far more persuasive. Too many scenes come off as flat, unconvincing. After one finely conceived event, the bubble of artistic persuasion can pop in the next scene with a notable lack of conviction.

Furthermore, the outwardly visible microphones on each character get in the way of establishing the brooding tragedy of the work. When such mics are used on the numerous Morbisch DVDs of operetta, this lighter fare seems to somehow withstand the mic look far better.

The filming, clarity of sound (the excellent orchestra was pre-recorded) and picture here are first rate. The 1940s look of the characters is compelling and atmospheric. Oke's Grimes has a plaintive, inner quality that is most convincing, and lends a major strength, even visually, to the performance. Giselle Allen's Ellen Orford and David Kempster's Balstrode are compelling. As an audio-only version, this would be outstanding. But for viewing, I will certainly return to the above-mentioned performances, all with outstanding portrayals of Grimes, before I will turn to this. Maybe you had to be at Aldeburgh to really enjoy it.",1441670400,3,4367,4.831550802139038
8622197,1,B00GCVWU4U,"I sat through the whole thing, hoping it would get better.  The star is Aldeburgh Beach.  Way too many long shots with -- oddly, for something filmed on a beach -- no sense of the ocean that pervades Britten's music, particularly the interludes.  The production lacked the two things the piece is about:  the vastness of external nature and the complexity of human nature.  Also, it was difficult to distinguish individual characters.  Even though it's sung in English, you really had to know the story inside and out to figure out what was going on.  I'm not a malcontent.  This is the first negative review I've ever posted.",1441411200,2,626,4.731481481481482

and moving rendition of Peter Grimes.",1441152000,,118,5.611111111111111
8622199,5,B00GCVWU4U,"Recorded live at Aldeburgh beach, it works amazingly well, and is the most powerful Grimes I've ever seen. Simply mesmerizing. Singers are miked, so the sound is natural and after a while you don't notice the head mikes at all. Everyone was excellent in their roles.

If you are a Grimes fan and have ever made the pilgrimage to Aldeburgh, you know what the experience does for your appreciation of Britten. If you haven't visited Aldeburgh yet, this performance will bring you close to it.",1416528000,8,490,4.764705882352941
8622200,5,B00GCVWU4U,"I have the original recording of Peter Grimes by Britten and Peter Pears.  It is the gold standard.  I own and listen to John Vicker's Grimes.  But this performance is absolutely riveting!  Obviously the staging is excellent, but the production's ability to bring this opera into my listening room is uncanny.  The video is without equal and the pre-recorded orchestra and amplified singers voices somehow work well.  The artistic content is served better than anything I've very heard.  There are no weakness in the cast.  Alan Oke's portrayal of Grimes most effectively reveals the complexity of his character and the sheer intensity of his role.  I found certain scenes to be absolutely frightening, which I am sure was Britten's intent.  In fact, as I went through this the first time, I wondered what Britten would have thought of this performance and production on Aldeburgh Beach.  I believe, like me, he would have given it an A+++.  I love this opera and it's a privilege to own a recording of this production.  My only regret is that I didn't know of the performance as it was given live.  I would have flown to England to be there!",1400112000,12,1142,4.760204081632653
