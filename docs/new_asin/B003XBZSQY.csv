8407918,3,B003XBZSQY,"Actually, two and a half would be more accurate.  I always enjoy Anna Neagle and Anton Walbrook, but this version of the Queen's life was too inaccurate: for example, it totally omitted seven of her nine children.",1466467200,2,213,4.756756756756757
8407919,4,B003XBZSQY,"This movie stars one of my favorite actors, Anton Walbrook, who plays a smart, sensitive and determined Prince Albert to Anna Neagle's bossy, little Victoria.  The movie is a homage to Victoria.  It was made in 1937, probably to cheer up the Brits in a darker decade and remind them of their empire and how it developed under Victoria. The production values are good and the filming took place in the actual palace settings.  This is an interesting movie, especially if you're an Anglophile.",1312761600,6,491,4.821428571428571
