Today I live within 4 blocks of a trauma center in Minneapolis and when I hear the medical chopper coming, I still get the same rush.

i didn't know alot about the vietnam war, but now i want to know more about all the heros that served in it.

This show should be shown in every school in this nation! Our children should know the price that was paid by these men and women.

If you are a veteran i want to say ""thank you""

If you are a vietnam veteran i want to say ""thank you and welcome home"".",1171238400,10,490,3.9693877551020407
2552899,5,B000F60KAE,"I would still be calling this the best documetnary I have ever seen - even if I had not been a part of the crew that took this old Huey helicopter (Aircraft 091 from the 173rd Assault Helicopter Company) across country almost 11,000 miles. Movie director and producer, Patrick Fries and his talented team, created one of the most sensitive documentaries ever made about the Vietnam War. It gives you insights on the war by focusing on the ""old wariors"" who were there. They tell their own stories and enrich this film in ways that old war footage could never do. The grunts, the pilots, the crew-chiefs, the medics, nurses, Donut Dollies, Marines, sailors etc. He has it all; award winning editing and great music makes it an inspiring and entertaining experience.

The movie captures the emotions and the feelings of this spiritual journey aross America. This is a high energy film and the music will inspire you as you soar and fly above the American South and Southwestern states on a mission to pay tribute to veterans from that war. The movie far exceeds any expectations that you might have.

The DVD cut is much more moving and emotionally alive than The Military Channel's version that has been shown nation wide so many times. This version is the driectors vision and it will capture your heart.

I was on this special aircraft and the the sacredness of that mission is fully represented in Arrowhead's wonderful DVD. I highly recomend this for all veterans and families of veterans. This film has been a healing experience for many who have watched it. The DVD is as close to having had taken the actual flight across country with us. You will feel like you are flying over the beaches of Florida and up the Mississippi River just feet above the water. You will see America open its heart to this crew and its Huey at so many landing zones - each filled with veterans and their families standing in awe of this old war bird!

The ending at Angel Fire, New Mexico - where our Huey was blessed in the morning sunrise - is great filming and a wonderful viewing experience. I recommend that you buy several copies and give them away as gifts to all the veterans you know or have in your life.

In the movie there are several playings of the song ""Amazing Grace"". There is no more sacred song; it fits this journey well. This recorded DVD has already brought healing for so many of the men and women that it has touched already.

God speed 091 and its crew ...and God bless all those who come to view this special movie.

Note: The Huey used for this film is now on display in Washington DC at the Smithsonian where it still is inspiring people.",1159315200,12,2650,4.5429769392033545
2552900,5,B000F60KAE,"This is the most moving show I have seen regarding Vietnam.  What makes this so unique is that it focuses on the individual veteran, or family of a veteran, now, 30-something years later, and how seeing the Huey again, helps them to heal. Telling their stories is so enlightening to those of us who stayed behind.  Even if you didn't have any family in Vietnam, the film is worth seeing.  Then you will realize that the Vietnam Veteran is a human being, just like all other soldiers who have gone to war for their country.  They are a loving bunch of guys who deserve our respect and our welcome home!!!

2552901,5,B000F60KAE,"Hello to all.

My name is John A. Adams. I flew for the 173rd AHC in '67&'68. The aircraft that you will see flying the 'wonderful healing mission' of ITSOTB is a genuine Robinhood . She is zero niner one. We lived in canvas tents on an old French rubber tree plantation 'out in the toolies'...and were known as the Robinhood's of Sherwood Forest. I flew third platoon 'gun's'. I am Crossbow three niner.

I am one of those Vietnam Veterans that did not do well after I came home from my tour. I was seriously injured, and got off to a bad start by a long hospitalized recovery period. I am not using this forum to speak of myself, but rather for this documentary In the Shadow of the Blade. You 'grunt's' know just what I mean. ""Your not gettin' out'a hear until you hear the sound of those blades"".

I walked my entire adult life not speaking of Vietnam. We Vietnam Veterans, on the most part, have difficulty relating our experience of trying to get back into 'the real world'. That is how we referred to leaving country to head home. The real world.

I flew with some of the people that you will see in this 'adventure'. I was thrilled at again seeing some of the guy's that crewed for me after all these many years. They are reverently referred to as GIB's. The guy's in back. Door gunners. And I can tell you first hand...they were marvelously NUTS.

The film speaks volumes for itself, through the mouths and tears of the Veterans that served. Parents, relatives, or friend to someone that you love - you will come to terms with your own issues about the Vietnam War, and her Veterans. In the Shadow of the Blade offers you an inside glimpse of the comraderie that we  share.

God Bless.

8117838,5,B000F60KAE,"I purchased this documentary when it first came out.  A friend recommended it, he was one of the pilots in the documentary.  This is by far the best documentary I have ever watched.  I had tears in my eyes virtually the entire time.  Some tears of joy and some tears of sadness and pain.  I highly recommend this DVD.  I loaned my DVD to a friend and it was misplaced.  I am buying another so I will always have it to remind me of how much our people sacrifice every time our country goes to war, and how poorly we treat our vets upon their return.  If you believe in a conflict or not, our soldiers deserve our respect and our thanks!",1511308800,,635,4.147540983606557

Like the sound of a .50 Cal firing, the sound of a Huey becomes indelibly inscribed on one's memory if (s)he were there. For those who flew in Hueys, whether up front driving them, as crew, or along for the ride, I think this is a great tribute and hopefully source of closure for my brother and sister vets who found themselves in the war zone for that conflict of dubious value.",1420761600,,527,4.28
