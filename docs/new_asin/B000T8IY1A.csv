8208059,4,B000T8IY1A,"The only drawback to the authoring is that despite the provision of commercial breaks, there is only one chapter on this DVD-R and no menu.

As of Jan. 2014, this DVD was still directly available from NBC.",1391126400,,205,4.54054054054054
8208060,5,B000T8IY1A,"Thought this was a super nerdy moment for me, but I loved every single second. Wish they would do this for every airline.",1382659200,,121,4.304347826086956
8208061,5,B000T8IY1A,"Saw this documentary on CNBC last year, 2009. Learn about the Ins and outs about the way American Airlines functions. Interesting and educative documentary. Learn about their business model and the way they are functioning under this lagging economy.",1290038400,,250,5.435897435897436
8208062,5,B000T8IY1A,"Wonderful DVD that takes you behind the scenes at American in all facets of the company....Ground Service, Mechanics, Agents, Flight Attendants, Cockpit Crew, Office Personnel, Upper Management right to the CEO and other departments. Saw it on TV and wanted to view it again without the commercials. I would recommend it to any airline buff or collector...well worth purchasing!",1253318400,,378,5.423728813559322
8208063,5,B000T8IY1A,"Well put together - covered quite a few aspects and included some great behind the scenes footage at AA. Parts of it felt like union ""propaganda"" but that didn't detract from the show. The best part is when Arpey (CEO) squirms and when asked about AAdvantage miles being hard to redeem, he laugs and says ""even my friends hate how hard it is to get tickets sometimes"" - that right there says a lot about what's wrong with AA.

I highly recommend getting this for yourself as an aviation enthusiast (why else would you be here?) as well as to open the eyes of those who aren't really ""in"" to airlines and such about what all it takes to get you from Des Moines to Delhi... For example, it helped my friends understand why overbooking is intentional and serves a purpose...before they just thought the airline couldn't count correctly!",1219708800,2,833,4.590604026845638
