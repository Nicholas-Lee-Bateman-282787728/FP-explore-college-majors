8412316,2,B0014FAISO,Such a good story wasted by director and producers. Movie is awful and totally inconsistent with the book. Quality of DVD is a disgrace.,1416700800,,136,4.708333333333333

8412318,2,B0014FAISO,"This 1978 movie, filmed on the Isle of Man, has heretofore only been available as a dark, murky, fuzzy, hard-to-see movie on VHS tape.  With this DVD release, we now have a dark, murky, fuzzy, hard-to-see movie on DVD.

In all fairness, I have to say that the DVD is an improvement over the VHS tape.  But it's not much of an improvement.  The DVD producers should have remastered the DVD from the original negatives.  Alas, they did not.

It could have been so much better.",1209772800,4,474,4.453488372093023
