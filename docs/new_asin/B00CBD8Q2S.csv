5711173,4,B00CBD8Q2S,"This is a completely cheesy 50's sci-fi film about a rather staid bunch of folks discovering a lost world in Antarctica. The dinosaur effects are mostly laughable, utilizing live-action lizards in some scenes, and an actor lumbering within an awkwardly-constructed tyrannosaurus costume in another (recalling the 1948 flick Unknown Island only not as fun). The plesiosaur in the lake creeped me out as a small child, though now it's mildly suspenseful as the toothy creature moves slower than a Viking longboat. The helicopter model shots are great, and I like the visual designs of the lost world itself. The actors in this film tend to be less-than-dramatic- Shirley Patterson (the only woman in the story) was probably seen as lovely in her time but she is downright expressionless in most scenes despite all the threatening goings-on, although she's a capable screamer (as was required in these sorts of films in those days). Jock Mahoney looks right in the part of Commander Hal Roberts. Henry Brandon as Dr. Carl Hunter, who was left stranded in Dino Land, is the most interesting character, having gone a little batty as a survivalist (and having facial hair and a dirty face). And being a film made in the 50's, most all the men act like awkward schoolboys around 'the woman who doesn't blink'. But at least there's some romantic aspect to this film that makes it a product of its time.

I still think The Land Unknown has one of the greatest movie posters of all time (which is printed not-too-well on the dvd cover). It also has the enjoyable feel of older films dealing with the search for and exploration of lost worlds which had been pioneered in King Kong. But in the 50's, any movie about dinosaurs (without Ray Harryhaysen's golden stop motion effects) had severe limits. It is odd that such a film was released in 1957, when science fiction seemed to be changing somewhat- The Land Unknown seems like a film that might have been produced ten years earlier. Yet it's still a hoot to watch (though MST3K never got hold of this film for lampooning).

Being a Universal Vault Series title, this film has no extras, not even a trailer let alone a menu, but that's no problem- once the film ends, it immediately reloops to play again. The film looks great in widescreen, and the epic film score by a number of uncredited composers, including a young Henry Mancini and Herman Stein, has been nicely mastered to Dolby Digital 2.0 mono.

For those of you who yearn for the old films such as this goofy adventure, by all means purchase it while it's still available.",1391126400,8,2573,4.751677852348993
5711174,5,B00CBD8Q2S,"Made in 1957 and in black & white. The land unknown is a movie about 4 people in a helicopter who crash land in what appear to be prehistoric times, complete with terrifying plants that attack you and a t-rex amonst other dinosaurs. The 4 people meet another man who was stranded there years ago, they battle with the dinosaurs, in the end they are rescued - its a happy ending. Picture and sound are excellent, at 78 mins it's not overly long this is a decent little movie, with decent special effects. The sets are great, This is my type of movie and i'd never seen it before.  Manufactured on demand release at 10 it's quite expensive, but with great picture & sound, and the rarity factor, i think it's a good buy, you won't hear any swearing, or any smut.

5711180,2,B00CBD8Q2S,"The Land Unknown, 1957 film

It begins with a view of Washington DC. A military officer talks of the investigation of the Antarctic. There may be valuable minerals there. A woman reporter arrives, she will be part of the expedition. The ship arrives in icy waters, the Ross ice pack. A helicopter flies away in 40 below weather. This area was once tropical in temperature. Bad weather forces a return through fog. Something happens, the helicopter loses altitude! It gets warmer outside. Can they repair the damage? No, the magnesium alloy rod breaks. They send a maidez call. They hear a scream. There is no climactic change, its like the Mesozoic Age. Can they be rescued by the Navy? If they drop a replacement part the helicopter can be repaired and fly away. They need fresh water. Then a huge lizard appears! The people run to the helicopter for refuge.

An unknown man grabs Maggie and carries her away in a boat. He speaks to her and says he is the lone survivor of an earlier expedition. He is the fittest to survive because of his intelligence. Dr. Hunter meets the others and offers them a deal. Will the lizards attack? Can a Colt .45 drive the huge lizard away? Maggie rows a boat on the water. Will she be threatened by a sea monster? (Does it look like the Loch Ness monster?) Can Dr. Hunter drive it away and rescue Maggie? Will one of the military try to rescue Maggie? Will they learn about the escape route? The men find wreckage and a replacement part. Can they take off before that huge monster lizard approaches? Can they rescue Maggie? What will happen to Dr. Hunter? It takes a good guy with a flare gun to stop that bad monster lizard. The helicopter flies back and lands on the ship; all are rescued. They plan to return next year. What will change?

This would have been a better movie with a better story to compensate for its low budget. Conan Doyles story of The Lost World must have inspired this story. This also appeared with the title Land of the Unknown.",1479600000,,1989,4.50415512465374

5711182,3,B00CBD8Q2S,"The 1957 sci-fi motion picture The Land Unknown is an archetypal mid-1950s black and white formula production from Universal.  A small group of explorers gets lost in a dinosaur infested world after their helicopter crash lands in the South Pole region.  Yep, the South Pole has an area where tropical plants and massive beasties thrive.  Dont try to analyze it or you will ruin the fun of the movie.

As always, the female lead (and the only female in the film) is drop dead lovely and the male lead  as well as his supporting actors  are hunks.  The male star is Jack Mahoney and the female lead is Shirley Patterson (billed as Shawn Smith).  Now, these folks are 1950s good looking, not 21st century good looking.  To me the girl couldn't look any better, but to young eyes she will probably look plump.  Hollywood of 1957 still liked women with hips  thank God.  The guys are actually buffed up for 1950, but appear un-muscled by todays standards.  No steroids.

In the typical sci-fi formula of the era, and not much different today, the group must be small, a few will die gruesome deaths, the people must become isolated, the threat needs to be otherworldly (dinos will do for otherworldly), a romantic interest must be established (no husband-wife) but unconsummated, and time has to become a critical factor.  The Land Unknown delivers on all counts.

The black and white filming is excellent.  By the mid-1950s Hollywood had perfected b&w film and it shows in this movie.

Keeping it kind, the special effects are not spectacular.  The T. Rex is appalling, the flying lizards don't flap their wings much, and the other dinosaurs are plastic looking  or worse  but its just part of the fantasy.  The writing isn't much better.  The addition of the crash survivor from years before as a foil to endanger the heroin was nuts.  His instant transformation from evil to OK guy adds to the insanity.  But, we started out in a tropical world in Antarctica so how much worse can it get?

Most of the acting is sub-par (D to C-) except for Ms. Patterson.  When she is supposed to be frightened she looks it.  As she falls for Mahoney her gaze changes from somewhat harsh or uncaring to concerned and finally loving.  Even her voice shows her changing emotions.  She did a good job (B+)

To the horror of feminist, in the last scene of the movie Ms Patterson tells Mahoney that she cant come on the next expedition because she will be home taking care of the baby.  Wow!  A woman wanting a baby from the man she loves.  Just awful.  Of course, I liked it.

Overall, this is a motion picture worth watching.  Jurassic Park realism alone doesnt equal a great film.  The Land Unknown is stilted, especially for our 21st Century eyes, but fun and entertaining nonetheless. Thats what movies are supposed to be.  Fun.  The Land Unknown comes through on that score.

5711196,3,B00CBD8Q2S,"THE LAND UNKNOWN (1957) takes place in a U.S. Navy briefing room, on naval ships on their way to Antarctica, and in a helicopter flying from a naval ship to the ""polar oasis,"" and inside the polar oasis.  Most of the time in this 1 hour, 18 minute movie takes place in the polar oasis.  The polar oasis takes the form of a swamp located at the bottom of a canyon with steep walls.  The walls are too steep for any person to climb.

THE CAST.  Shirley Patterson, billed in this movie as ""Shawn Smith,"" plays Maggie.  Maggie is a reporter for a newspaper called, Oceanic Press.  She is generically pretty, and a blonde, and her character is an intelligent one.  Commander Roberts (born 1919) is played by Jock Mahoney.  He is the handsome, older one of the ensemble.  Lieutenant Jack Carmen (born 1931) is the helicopter pilot.  He is played by William Reynolds, who is boyishly handsome, and who resembles Leonard Dicaprio.  Steve is a machinist who plays a character who is sometimes impulsive and eager to fight.  Steve is played by actor Phil Harvey, who also appeared in THE MONOLITH MONSTERS (1957) and THE DEADLY MANTIS (1957).

THE SCENERY.  The scenery in the polar oasis steals the show.  Apparently, the entire polar oasis resides in a sound studio.  Distant mountains are obviously paintings.  At times, scenes in the polar oasis are obscured by thick fog, made by a fog machine.  The set designers did an incredibly excellent job at recreating a prehistoric swamp.  Parts of the set reminded me of CONGAREE SWAMP NATIONAL PARK in South Carolina.  On a couple of occasions, a carnivorous plant with thin octopus tentacles reaches out to grab actress Shirley Patterson.  The swamp also includes large monsters, including a tyrannosaurus rex, a plesiosaur, and a pterodactyl.  These are played by excellent full-scale models.  The T-Rex plods its way through the heavily forested dry parts of the swamp, and manages to keep its balance, despite being about 20 feet tall.  I am not sure what makes it walk.  It much to big to be operated by a man inside it. (One of the other Amazon.com reviewers states that a man is inside the T-Rex.  This could be.  But to me, the T-Rex really looks 20 feet tall, as it walks through the swamp and towers over the exploring party.)  Also, there are two large monitor lizards.  These are real, live monitor lizards, and there is a splendid fighting scene.  (In my opinion, the monitor lizards should have been fitted with false teeth, since there are not as threatening as they could be in this movie, since no teeth are visible.)  I marveled at the reconstructed prehistoric swamp all during this movie.

THE PLOT.  Early in the movie, the foursome (three men and the lady) are in their helicopter, but bad weather forces it down.  Unexpectedly, when the helicopter is attempting to land it turns out that land is a couple of thousand feet below sea level. During the landing, a pterodactyl flies by and clips part of the rotor, and damages it slightly.  After landing in the swamp, called the ""polar oasis,"" the group ponder their fate.  Now and then, the film highlights Shirley Patterson's femininity, but any romance or physical contact is essentially non-existent in the script.  The Commander keeps track of the time using sticks in a stump as a calendar, and as the weeks go by, Shirley Patterson's garb becomes more scanty, and there are plenty of scenes showing the marvelous morphology of her gams.  As if the foursome were not already in enough danger, the group encounters a hermit by the name of Dr. Hunter, who had been stranded during an earlier expedition which had used the same type of helicopter.  Dr. Hunter's three exploring partners had died in the polar oasis, leaving him alone.  Dr. Hunter has learned to defend himself by way of a conch, which he blows, and which effectively makes the dinosaurs lose interest in him.  Also, Dr. Hunter effectively makes use of flaming torches, to deflect the plesiosaur.  Eventually, the group succeeds in persuading Dr. Hunter to talk, and he reveals that his crashed helicopter has a spare part that can be used to fix the foursome's helicopter.  The general thrust of the last third of this movie, is to persuade Dr. Hunter to reveal the location of the crashed helicopter, so that the foursome can scavenge the needed part, and also to persuade Dr. Hunter that he should desire to return to civilization (and stop being a hermit in the polar oasis).

HUMOR.  There are small amounts of humor in this movie.  In the helicopter ride over Antarctica at the beginning of the movie, Maggie sees two seals romping together.  ""MAN AND WIFE,"" she proclaims.  But the commander adds, ""No, they're both male.""  A minute later, also from the helicopter, Maggie sees a bunch of penguins and she exclaims, ""LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE ALL WEARING TUXEDOS.""  But the commander corrects her and says, ""No, they're all female.""

TURNING POINT.  The turning point in this movie occurs at one hour and two minutes.  The commander says: ""We're not going to dig our way out of here through human flesh.  Not Maggie's, not even yours.""  He is giving a lecture to the misanthropic Dr. Hunter.  Hunter replies, ""No one asked you to come here.""  Maggie chimes in, ""We're here to help you.""  Hunter scoffs at them and says, ""I don't need your help or your pity.""  The commander replies with, ""We all need pity and we all need help.""  At this point, Dr. Hunter changes his mind, and provides a map that shows the location of the helicopter.  The commander gives a little speech, ""It's true that you can't live among beasts without becoming one, but its just as true that you can't live among human beings without becoming affected by their humanity.""  Hunter listens intently to this little speech, and the viewer realizes that the speech has changed his mind about being a hermit.

CONCLUSION.  Don't worry, I will not give away the ending of this movie.  Regarding the script, there are moments that almost seem inspirational. The screenplay is workman-like.  This is not a great movie.  But it is a better than average B movie.  The following provides some perspective.  The very best of the monster movies and science fiction movies from this era include the following.  The following movies are not in any way B-movies.  In my opinion, they are rock-solid icons of American culture.  These movies include: SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD produced by Ray Harryhausen and written by Kenneth Kolb, IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA by  Ray Harryhausen, VALLEY OF GWANGI produced by Ray Harryhausen and written by William Bast and others, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL directed by Robert Wise and written by Edmund North.  Now regarding THE LAND UNKNOWN, it is a better than average B movie.",1401148800,4,6753,4.767702936096718
