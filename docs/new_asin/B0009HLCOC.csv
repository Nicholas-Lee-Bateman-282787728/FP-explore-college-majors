8061020,4,B0009HLCOC,"A collection of three bawdy British sex comedies from the early 70's - first up is 'Can You Keep It Up For A Week?' a comment a girl asks her boyfriend, but she's referring to him holding down a job, something this slacker finds impossible until he's 'servicing' the cute crumpets employing him.

Then there's 'The Au Pair Girls', four seductive micro-mini clad vixens who get caught in compromising positions while working as Au Pairs (apparently, this was synonymous with shagging young chicks from foreign lands back then). Some of these cherubs are mouth watering and require a drool-cup while watching.

Last is 'Sex And The Other Woman', a cautionary tale about four weak-willed husbands tempted by busty beauties with irresistible allure and the ensuing comedic consequences.

 Randy humor permeates these lightweight vehicles that seem dated today, yet hold some endearing charm for those of us who were around back then, or folks just seeking a retro-laugh along the lines of 'Love, American Style' with copious amounts of skin. It'll help you keep a Stiff Upper Lip, Mate!",1284076800,,1082,5.061797752808989
8061021,3,B0009HLCOC,"In watching two of the three DVDs in this collection (one would not play) I was bemused and even bored at times. SEX AND THE OTHER WOMAN gives four scenarios of weak-willed men and their reactions to the delightful allure
of sex. The last episode tells of a man with a beautiful, passionate wife who also has an exciting lover with an astoningly proportioned body which would make Playboy girls drool. He can to go from one to another though at one time when his wife wants lively sex, there is some limpness.

Then the wife finds out about the lover and goes to visit her. Here the results are quite the opposite of what one might expect. The two ladies do not show jealousy: Quite the obvious.  The wife invites the mistress to live with them. He can sleep each night with either and there is no jealousy. Her mother feels the wife is insane. Yet she feels having the mistress there eliminates all chances of further stray. How delightful if a US film make could duplicate this?

In AU PAIR, lovely ladies from Russia are hired by an agency to be maids. They are told to do whatever the hiring couple wants. At the same time most have their own sexual needs and want to frequently show their full
nudity. The virgin is taken to a bar, dressed very sexy, is deflowered by a callous drunk rock star while her partner remains intertwined in the
body of her lover. She is dissatisfied. Another lusty lady is introduced to the precious young son, a fabulous pianist who plays real hide and seek
not ever having seen nudity or experienced sex. She seduces him and they
enjoy making love, but there is also some disillusion.  A third breaks
the employer's rules by staying out all night when she is supposed to be home by 11 pm.

While partying, somehow she is stolen away by a rich shiek and taken to his huge castle,surrounded by lovely lasses prancing nude focusing on satisfying his every need. Continually showing full nudity, when shown the master budoir this au pair starts jumping on the mattress like it is a trampoline. The shiek gets excited too. She loves the new life and returns to the agency to express delight. But there she sees the other au pairs back there disillusioned and ready to return home.

Alas something happens and they join her in starting a new exciting life where all their needs can be fulfilled.  I do not want to give the end fully away.  Note: I could not get the one of the three dvds, CAN YOU KEEP IT FOR A WEEK to play. But the two were ample.

I got to see lots of full female nudity while the male was hidden most often. This is soft or semi-hard porn presented in an artistic humorous manner.  Those who love seeing beautiful nudes prance will revel in the
collection. Others looking for more substance can be amused but will not call the set ""a keeper.""  My exterminator, a much older man familiar with British humor wanted to buy the set from me on the spot, desiring to replay many scenes over and over. Will you? I was turned off by the traditional views of wimpish cowered British men.  Try it and see. The price being asked is low. I have paid more for much less joy.",1218240000,8,3110,4.4178321678321675
8061022,4,B0009HLCOC,"Even if you are a prude you still may enjoy these three tame, but eye filling movies made in and around London in the 1970s.  This was before the era of hard-core porn in theaters and VCRs.  The movies now seem innocent and that's what makes them delightful in their own way.  There are plenty of fully naked beautiful young ladies running around in all three films.  This was always worth the price of admission.  The stories and situations are for the most part fun, many familiar actors of the era appear in them.  Production values are good and all three movies are in color.",1168819200,5,579,4.466666666666667
8061023,2,B0009HLCOC,"The ""Naughty Britain"" collection is typical of the ""soft-core"" girlie flicks that were produced in Britain during the 1970's. Outright hardcore was still illegal, but imagine this trio of sexy delights as a next step in the style pioneered by the saucy ""Carry-On"" films and ""Benny Hill"" TV shows. The girls are totally naked and the men are -well lets just say they don't get too aroused in all the simulated sex scenes. What makes this dvd collection somewhat arousing though, is the fact that so much British comedic talent were featured in them. It was a sign of the times that British cinema was reduced to this level back then. Even veteran directors like Val Guest, were desperate enough to take this kind of work. Of course it's all so dated and tame by today's ""in your face"" standards, but then it helps to be British to appreciate them at all.

I remember these skin epics actually playing at the same high street theatres that once showed the likes of ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" and ""2001"". Towards the late 1970's even a pre-Dynasty Joan Collins went willingly to star in ""The Bitch"" and ""The Stud"". The titles tell it all and tease you with what you might hope to find. However, if you prefer to read about this titilating chapter of British cinema history, check out Simon Sheridan and Johnny Vegas' ""Keeping The British End Up -Four Decades of Saucy Cinema"" on Amazon.",1166918400,5,1377,4.666666666666667
