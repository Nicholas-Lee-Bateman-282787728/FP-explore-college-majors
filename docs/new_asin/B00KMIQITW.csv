8660048,1,B00KMIQITW,"There's only one impressive aspect of this film, and that is the fact that it was made by a group of school kids around the age of seventeen. I didn't know this until after I'd sat through all sixty-two minutes of the film. Knowing that it was a labor of love for fledgling filmmakers answers a lot of questions, but -- unlike many of the other reviewers I've read on other sites -- I still don't feel compelled to give the film extra stars on the basis of its creators' ages. I'm assuming this was primarily a learning experience for them anyways, so why coddle things?

The story takes place in a future where teleportation has replaced regular transportation, and schools have been replaced by knowledge chips that you can just plug into your wrists. In the midst of this techno-topia, three billion people suddenly just disappear. Simultaneously, a young boy named Ian is accidentally sent into an alternate dimension when he discovers in his pocket a suicide note from his 5 year-old brother. Ian must now get back to his own dimension in time to stop his brother from killing himself, and hopefully he'll stumble across the secret for the missing population as well.

For a movie with such a small budget, the story is ambitious beyond belief. Also, beyond the makers ability to tell it clearly. Most of the script is a confusing mess, and its a constant strain to figure out exactly what's going on. This is made worse by dialogue that is heavy-handed when it isn't aimless, spacy, or laden with cliche. That is, when I could hear it. The sound levels are way out of balance here, and a lot of the dialogue -- already made mushy by actors that are obviously uncomfortable with English -- is buried underneath the soundtrack.

The special effects are decent, and the general camerawork is serviceably competent, which is something I never would've written had I not known the director was a teenager. Really though, that's about the only thing the film has going for it. As well-framed and -colored as it is, the acting is still atrocious across the board. By the time I figured out what was going on, I found it very difficult to understand why I should care. Our lead, Ian, is set up as an impossibly nice person (Screenwriting Rule #1: your protagonist should never be flawless), and his suicidal brother is meant to be like the equivalent of an emotional nicotine patch for the film to make sure he never loses the audience's sympathies. But it's so openly manipulative (the brother's depression is never adequately explained; he just wants to kill himself) that it is more annoying than anything else.

The product of kids with obvious camera talent, this film's creators still have quite a bit to learn when it comes to actually writing and telling a story.",1403568000,,2769,4.703092783505155
