7900987,5,8373919279,"Hitchcock's 1946 ""romantic"" thriller stars Ingrid Bergman as the daughter of a Nazi spy living in the United States convicted of treason. Bergman an amorous and promiscuous playgirl who is reluctantly conscripted by an enigmatic American espionage agent Cary Grant, finds herself in more peril than she bargained for on her assignment in Brazil. This has always been considered one of Hitchcock's better thrillers, however personally I never found it that intriguing even though I am a Hitchcock enthusiast. I even watched this film again before I wrote this review. For me it seems a bit out of step from his other films. In a strange way it jumps ahead to a style Hitchcock employed in 1969's TOPAZ. For me it lacks romanticism. There are love scenes just as there are in TOPAZ. Equally as in TOPAZ the actors just seem to be going through the motions in these passionate scenes. However, there is no lack of acting talent in either film. Hitchcock's intent of the histrionics is for his actors to give as realistic performances as possible and downplay the dramatics. The characters in both films are spies and live their lives from day to day never knowing if this one will be their last. People leading such lives must learn to go on with detached indifference and suppress any feelings of emotion and love. Both Bergman and Grant turn in excellent performances. This is not the same Cary Grant audiences were used to seeing. He let none of his own personality surface and just played the character as written. He remains always distant and aloof in his scenes with Bergman. We can only read the disgust on his face when Bergman is off camera of his true feelings for her. Bergman playing off his aloofness also suppresses her love for him when both are on camera together. So there is a romantic theme in the film but it is not visually provocative as in other Hitchcock films because of the constraints of the film's plot. That is what makes it look so different from his other films. We also see shades of PSYCHO present in this film. Claude Rains as the aristocratic Nazi Alexander Sebastian has a similar quixotic relationship with his mother as Norman Bates has or had with his. One highlight of the film is underrated composer Roy Webb's beautifully written theme. From a technical standpoint Hitchcock once again pulls off an impressive and notable camera shot, somewhat similar to a shot he later used in MARNIE. Hitchcock brings the camera from the top of a stairway overlooking a huge cocktail party in Claude Rains' sprawling mansion and slowly moves through the guests right up to the ""key"" that is in Bergman 's hand. The close up of the ""key"" is a crucial one for that ""key"" physically and symbolically unlocks the secret disguised in Claude Rains' mysterious wine cellar. This film is Hitchcock's most underplayed and seductively sensuous. It is never overtly romantic yet remains absorbing and suspenseful. However I still do not think it looks like your typical Alfred Hitchcock film.",1194998400,,3007,4.818181818181818
