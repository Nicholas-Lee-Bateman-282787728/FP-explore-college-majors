4933724,4,B0062QHZJU,"A bit of harmless fluff with plenty of eye candy. Advertising man is frustrated with his job and his relationship, so he uses a dating service that beats Siri on the latest iPhone. He meets several possibilities only to realize that new is not necessarily better. Morgan Fairchild plays an amusing cameo. The cast are young, good looking, frequently shirtless, and actually display some acting talent. A pleasant enough way to kill a couple hours.",1337385600,,447,4.973333333333334

And, yes, let me get it right out there and up front:  This is a well-done production (Calciano is very good at surrounding himself with capable cinematography and sound folks---there's little to fault).  Obviously, his casting personnel have done their best to provide us with cute and hunky co-leads, as well as a fun group of major supporting actors (mention of some, below).  It was a rare moment when their character arcs didn't ring true (obviously, the writing helped here).  As to Storyline, it's as much one of ""today's world"" as it could possibly be....giving us an enjoyable ride and any number of lessons to be learned.

BUT having said all that, a large reservation remains for me....and it involves the Romantic angle of a story like this.  So let me be the Bad Guy in this group and explain my last statement in the following way:

Some pre-release photo shots and a preview trailer led this Fan to believe, or hope, that our Good Director Calciano had perhaps read and paid attention to a past review of mine (""Is It Just Me?""), in which I took he and other Gay Romance film directors to task for NOT providing realistic kissing scenes.  About his last film's attempts, I basically stated:  ""Blink and you'll miss 'em.""  ....And STILL, in this latest work, it seems if you ""double-blink,"" you'll miss 'em.  Maybe that's because our two ""eCupid"" lead actors give little more than quick pecks on the lips or cheek (surely not a case of:  ""Folks will think I'm Gay""!?).  Though I must concede that Frat-Boy Dawson was really ""persistent"".....and fellow worker, Keith (Matt Lewis, in an exciting performance) gave his lip-lock a really good shot.

Other main supporting actors of note include Andy Anderson (Chris 1).....and of course, the inestimable Morgan Fairchild, as the Divinity Drive-In's Mother Confessor....and Guru of Love (she probably even out-angels Gabriel in this film).

Now, let's hope there is some ""learning"" being derived from reviews put out there by nonprofessional guys such as you and I.  Let's also hope for better film productions in future.  (Still and all, I'd buy another of this Director's films.)

By George...I think I've got it!  I believe I'll just close out these comments with my parting review words re: our Director's last film:

""So, how to end all this? Let me do it by asking: Is it fun and cute and attention-holding? Well, yes....for the most part. But that doesn't mean it couldn't have been better....and my rating reflects that. (And yes, yes, yes....I have watched it more than once before butting in).""",1337299200,4,2605,4.888382687927107
4933726,5,B0062QHZJU,"As Marshall approaches his 30th birthday, he grows increasingly concerned that his 7-year relationship with his boyfriend, Gabe, may have gotten too comfortable for him to realize that they have become bored with each other, and increasingly seem to find reasons not to spend quality time together.  While surfing the internet, he stumbles across an ad for a new ""app"" called ""eCupid,"" which is ""guaranteed"" to find your true love.  He downloads it, but, when the screen blanks out, assumes it didn't work.  He soon finds out that eCupid is at work, significantly more intrusive and controlling of his life than he ever imagined it could be.  But, perhaps, that could be what he needs?

It's a cute idea, working as a gay dating fantasy, as well as a tongue-in-cheek satire about how Smartphone ""apps"" and chronic texting have taken over some people's lives.  More than anything else, it celebrates the value of relationships, and is an excellent film to show to mixed gay/straight audiences. The musical score is refreshingly good, and it features a talented young cast, and you may glimpse a couple of familiar faces, including a gay member of ""The Real World: DC"" cast and the hunky Irish guy on ""TMZ on TV.""  There's also Morgan Fairchild, in a scene-stealing role as a coffee shop waitress.

From the writer-director who gave us the entertaining ""Is It Just Me?"" and the amusing web series ""Steamroom Stories.""  The DVD extras include actor interviews and auditions, outtakes and a music video. Also available streaming and on-demand on many services. Not perfect, but I can't justify giving it less than five stars out of five.",1336348800,,1633,4.930656934306569
4933727,5,B0062QHZJU,"My first thought when I heard the title ""eCupid"" was this was some sort of Apple Co. title knockoff similar to iTouch, iTunes, etc. I was pleasantly surprised to find a gay romantic story brought into the modern world of high tech gadgetry. It also made me think how similar heterosexual relationships were to homosexual ones, the only difference being obvious.

Marshall (Houston Rhines) is an arrogant young man working for a ruthless and unappreciative boss. The relationship he has with Gabe (Noah Schuffman) has become rather routine and dull. He feels as if has to move on in his life and find someone or something else to keep his interests alive. When he eventually goes online, he runs across a mysterious app titled ""eCupid"" that supposedly is the Holy Grail to seeking true love. From the instant that he downloads it, his world starts to unravel. He soon discovers that the app becomes overwhelming by sending messages about sexy guys to his phone. Each one of the men comes with a promise of meeting the man of his dreams. Sooner, rather than later, Marshall discovers that all of the attention that eCupid has been responsible for is way more than he had envisioned.

Enter the eerily mysterious diner waitress, played by Morgan Fairchild, who convinces Marshall to just follow his heart and eventually he'll come to the conclusion of what really matters in life. Morgan Fairchild is absolutely amazing in her role. It was amazing to see her again knowing that she has a decades long history in the entertainment field. I believe time has stood still in her case.

JC Calciano has written a beautiful, yet thought provoking script dealing with everyday life, be it gay or straight. His interweaving of a romantic tale with today's modern technologies was very unique and amusing ... and it works!",1333065600,,1810,4.851132686084142
4933728,5,B0062QHZJU,"If you're looking for a heart warming, fun, laugh out loud romantic comedy, then eCupid is the movie for you! Fast paced, and filled with colorful characters, eCupid draws you in from the beginning and keeps you entertained until the last scene. eCupid is a unique movie that easily captures audiences from every walk of life and whether you're gay, straight or indifferent, you'll definitely enjoy this magical ride.

I give eCupid two thumbs up!",1332892800,2,447,4.96
4933729,5,B0062QHZJU,"I loved this movie. It told a universal story of how it can take a long crazy journey to find the love that is right in front of you. All of that with a modern tech twist (an app that throws Marshall's wilting relationship with his boyfriend Gabe into turmoil in order to help him understand that his true love for Gabe was there all the time). It made a classic story seem fresh and interesting. And the performances of the leads were subtle and the chemistry was unmistakable. The supporting ""cupids"" were cute, funny, and witty, and Morgan was wonderful as Venus herself.

It was great to have a movie that showed that gay relationships have the same problems as straight ones. Share this movie with someone you love!",1332547200,22,720,4.538461538461538

4933731,5,B0062QHZJU,"In a complex, over stimulated, fast paced world I found this movie to be light hearted yet meaningful. There is so much drama in our everyday lives that ecupid is a breath of fresh air!!! In addition it addresses a modern day situation of cell phones and the temptations that they bring to our lives.
The movie has humor that appeals to everyone. I saw the movie in mixed company and everyone was enjoying it. Laughing is a wonderful common denominator for all.
The characters are extremely likable. We all either have been in that situation or are familiar with it and can relate on some level!
See the movie; enjoy it for its charm and humor!!!",1332374400,3,646,4.52991452991453
4933732,5,B0062QHZJU,"I really enjoyed eCupid for its realistic take on the complications of
a relationship. There is a broad range of characters that all drive
this story forward.

I found the characters (Marshall and Gabe) very likable and easy to
relate to and it was nice to see them grow in the end.

eCupid really is for everyone.

As in life its hard to find what your looking for, and in a
relationship you don't know what you have until its gone.

After seeing the movie you really appreciate the love you have in your
own life even more.",1332374400,16,525,4.326530612244898
4933733,5,B0062QHZJU,"Writer/Director JC Calciano's previous film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Is-It-Just-Me/dp/B004CJ76Z2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Is It Just Me?</a>, is one of my favorites, so this film had a high bar to meet. I'm happy to say that it does. eCupid is a romantic fantasy in the style of 80s flicks like Splash and Big. It's a breezy and charming story brought to life by a talented and good-looking cast. The fantastical element that runs through eCupid is clever and smart. I really like the way the film explores the evolving role that technology plays in our lives...as a force for both good and bad.

Marshall (adorable Houston Rhines) is turning 30 and his life is stuck in a rut. He's in a stale relationship and a dead-end job (soap star John Callahan plays his boss). Looking for help, Marshall downloads an app to help him find love...and it turns his life completely upside down. Morgan Fairchild makes a great cameo as a mysterious and wise waitress. High marks across the board for this funny, sweet comedy. A must see!",1332374400,17,1076,5.255813953488372

I can only include that as he is ""unknown talent"" he came cheap and hence got that part. Worse yet, there is zero chemistry between any of the actors and the semi sex scenes make you chuckle.

4933767,3,B0062QHZJU,"The core premise of this movie relies on whether or not you believe in eCupid being not just intelligent but also manipulative and practically clairvoyant. I know it's meant to be cute and funny but you can only go so far from reality before the whole thing falls apart. And to have Marshall allow himself to be essentially bullied by an app just seems a little too weird for me. If he really was that shallow, then who would actually to be in a relationship with that kind of a guy?

The acting was a little flat, admittedly, with many of the supposedly comedic scenes somehow not playing how quite right from a timing perspective. It's hard to say precisely if it's all because of acting being less that what was needed or if they somehow lacked direction - it was probably an odd mix of both.

For many queer fans, the real gem of the movie was the involvement of Morgan Fairchild who was both the voice of eCupid and another character later on - I won't tell you who. Oh yes, we love our icons and to be fair, she still looks quite stunning regardless of your sexual orientation. And in a way, her involvement in this movie seemed as ethereal and magical as eCupid itself.

On the whole, the movie still has a decent message even though it has a somewhat roundabout way of telling it. Then again, if you've watched enough romantic comedies in your life, then you can pretty much predict the movie's almost fairy tale ending.

eCupid could have been so much more, I feel, but it's still better than most of the mindless pink flicks that come out. Instead of promoting a life of promiscuity and recklessness, at least the movie still aspires to promote the value of true love.",1390176000,,1678,4.456026058631922

The movie covers the social issues of phone apps, infidelity, relationship, and how middle age in the gay community is looked down upon. The movie rounds itself out with the concept that young and lustfull is not always a good thing. Sometimes love, respect, understanding, appreciation, and communication can mean a lot more than how many frat boys can you line up in a week. It talks about what is comfortable and stable can sometimes mean that people and relationships are being taken for granted. The film does keep it light hearted, and the guys are all drop dead gorgeous. So enjoy and read as deep or as shallow as you want.

The other most promentary point is that relationships are hard work and that both persons have to be willing to work and, yes, compromise if necessary.  This is a film that you and the one you love and care about, should view it together.  The theme of this flix is very, most inordinately, purposeful.

The test comes when one of the partners, after being bored of his parnter; decides to fill out a online profile for E-Cupid online Profile service.

Its so true what they say ""You don't know what you got till its gone"", and this movie definitely gives the EXTREME version of that phrase.  It takes you up to the party life, and down the valley of ultimate heart break in its own right.
The clincher is what all people face in a relationship.  Sometimes we get too comfortable and don't see what we really have.  This movie definitely takes a hard look at a couple who are still deeply in love, just needs to be reminded of it.

In turn, A total win in my enjoyment!  Gay and lesbian movies are totally getting deep!  I encourage anyone who believes in parntership and LTR to buy this movie, share it with your partner.

All the technical pieces such as sets, lighting, camera work are well done - the production values are beyond your typical indie.  It is a very white and male world these characters live in, though the forced in politically correct character might be worse.  The biggest weak point is the script.

Because of that it helped me remove my previous assumptions of how a relationship would be, if I was in one that is, with another man. Thus it also makes this whole ""coming out"" thing for me feel less awkward and lonesome. This was the first gay film that I saw and at first I was quite skeptical. And I had good reason to be too. Some of the scenes are cheesy and pretty flat. But I won't lie... eCupid has its golden scenes that justify it as a well made film that will make you-- well, it made me at least :)-- laugh and feel great inside.

And the premise that we believe an app could prevent emails, text messages and behave like a demonic robot to prevent these men from keeping their relationship was a huge stretch. I kept hoping the lead would just screw his co-worker. I seriously did not have any emotional attachment to either, and felt they were poorly developed and wished they just went ahead and did something nasty to their hookups. Boring. Sorry. Hate to say that, but that whole, you don't appreciate what ya got til you lose it, just didn't ring true. There was no chemistry between the two leads and to be honest, I simply didn't care.

And how in the world would the application know Grant's destination? The inclusion of Morgan Fairchild's character made even less sense. (Though it's wonderful to see Morgan Fairchild looking as radiant as always.) And would Marshall REALLY have purchased Gabe's diner when he wouldn't have known whether Gabe would even take him back? And if Marshall got fired, how could he afford the financing? After all, he was only 30 & was just starting out on his own! This movie is just a well-intentioned mess.

I was expecting another awful low budget indie such as ""Finding Mr. Wright"", but thankfully 'eCupid' raises the bar for the gay movie audiences. There is no such thing as a perfect movie so I justify my 5 star rating in relation to the slew of similarly themed movies which pale in comparison.

For instance, I didn't feel anything in the kissing between the two male leads - it was like dry pecks on your grandmother's cheek. If it was meant to be a celebration of love, especially the love between two men, my take is that the portrayals of the two lead characters could have been more physically energetic because that's how men, generally, express love - with a big dash of lust thrown in. In the end, the film didn't take me on a celebratory high so, it was a little disappointing from that perspective.",1345420800,,764,4.708955223880597

4933829,4,B0062QHZJU,"Yes another gay rom com and if that is your bag then this sort of delivers. The plot is that Marshall (Houston Rhines) is approaching 30 and a mid life crisis with equal tenacity. This is not helped by his boyfriend of seven years Gabriel (Noah Scuffman) who is working so hard at his cafe that all he wants to do is come home and go to bed, to sleep that is. Marshall is a semi unsuccessful advertising exec and starts to hate his job along with his situation, his boss though gets some of the best one liners, that would get him in an employment suit as quick as you can say `outdated bigot' - brilliant.

So with no bed time activity other than snoring on the menu, Marshall plays with his mobile phone, and gets to download a free app. This is eCupid, where love is guaranteed. Then stuff starts to happen and he goes from being terminally frustrated to the centre of the gay universe pretty much over night.

This has a fair few laughs and a big moralistic tale written all over its assured face. From director J.C. Calcianno (`Is it just me?') this is well acted and directed and has some very easy on the eye moments, mind you we do get two of the most lack lustre gogo boys ever, but I can forgive them that as it is supposed to be lunchtime (where is this bar?). It does come across as predictable, but also very warm, I wish there really was such an app and I'd be down the Smart phone shop quicker than a prize winning thorough bred. We also have a shoe horned cameo from Morgan Fairchild and bless her for adding some down at heart glamour as Venus the waitress who oozes old world charm and homely advice.

4933840,5,B0062QHZJU,"eCupid is fun, light, sweet and very romantic. I had already enjoyed the previous movie by J.C. Calciano, Is It Just Me?, but I have to admit it was a little low budget and you could see it. In eCupid this perception is almost nada, and almost everything is perfect, from the chosen cast to the setting to the music. True, there are some gay stereotypes, the frat boy, the party boy, the twink, the buddy friend, but no one of them is exaggerated, or depicts in a way that is offensive, it's more a way for the main character to realize he is in love with his boyfriend, and that he has to do everything he can to mend the break between them.

Gabe has few to do on his side, since, from how I see it, he only tried to not overcome his lover with his trouble, when he knew Marshall had few of his own. Gabe is sweet and kind, and really the perfect boyfriend. Marshall is simply having a 7 years scratch itch, and with the intervention of a very useful Apps, eCupid, he will understand how stupid he has been.

Houston Rhines, in the role of Marshall, is perfect, if not a little ""couch potato"", meaning that he is waiting for the solution to come to him and not viceversa. He is not that bad, but he has to grow a back bone ;-) said that he is cute, and he really doesn't do anything to alienate his sweet boyfriend, and so he has the right to have him back.

Noah Schuffman as Gabe is more than cute, and he is also sweet and kind, and yes, sexy, way sexier than all the other men Marshall will meet. He is the right catch, and rightly, once he is ""temporarily"" free, he will have the line in front of him.

4933842,1,B0062QHZJU,"another addition to the canon of crap gay cinema. i was particularly excited about this one. a contemporary gay romance that deals with technology and social networking, sounds promising. unfortunately the acting is a joke and the script is utterly boring. the dialogue falls flat in every scene and it somehow manages to be predictable and unbelievable at the same time. the character development is non-existent. you never really get to know who these people are and what motivates them beyond the surface level. there is no depth to the plot and a photo-montage at the beginning is not nearly enough back-story to adequately convey the connection the two main characters are supposed to have with each other. this film is a waste of time and money. just don't even bother.",1338163200,8,775,4.923664122137405
4933843,2,B0062QHZJU,"What a horrible little film. Perhaps 'horrible' is a little harsh (but only a little), but it is in response to the overwhelming positive reviews. If you look at other websites, this film is general DISliked. Also notice that the single largest place of origin of these positive reviewers in Los Angeles. Also notice how one reviewer encourages you to ""check out this director's other works"". I'm all for dissenting reviews, but this is just fishy.

Either way, this film does not work. We are supposed to feel bad for Gabriel when his boyfriend, Marshall, has reservations about their 7-year relationship. Who wouldn't have reservations? Gabriel is whiny, rude, and sardonic. He doesn't put-out despite the main characters repeated attempts at intimacy. On a more superficial note, Gabriel isn't particularly attractive, either. Furthermore, Gabriel leaves their home when Marshall's feelings are revealed.

The film ends with the main character admitting that he is selfish, emotionally unavailable, etc. That may have been the screenplay's intent, but the film didn't show that at all. It shows the opposite. As previously stated the main character is much more amicable and mature than his boyfriend which directly contradicts the plot.

The only things going for the film is that some of the characters are well played and attractive, and the premise is good.

If you are looking for a new gay-themed film, go watch ""You Should Meet My Son!"" or ""Is It Just Me"" (though not quite as new).",1338076800,,1492,5.077551020408163

My only complaints: sound could have been so much better and some of the background score/music was a little too muzak-like. Loved the story and kind of scary what technology might be able to do.,1509408000,,281,4.755102040816326
