8534172,2,B0091ICZ8C,"I am a private therapist. I hoped this would be helpful for court ordered parenting participants but instead I found the information VERY uninformative. Very slow moving. The filming and editing was nice, but the content was nothing interesting, original or educational. I went with another video ""Raising children of divorce"" a practical help for parents. It is specific and very helpful with much much better content.",1421971200,,419,5.268656716417911

8534174,5,B0091ICZ8C,"This educational DVD discussing divorce and its impact on teenagers is the best I've ever viewed!

Learn more about the better and worse paths through the divorce transition and how parents and teens can move successfully through their family divorce.",1351728000,,370,5.362068965517241
8534175,5,B0091ICZ8C,This is a must see for teens and their families who are divorcing or who are divorced.  Divorce is not only about the two people divorcing but the entire family.

8534176,5,B0091ICZ8C,Dr. Kristine Turner's video provides a useful discussion on a painful and challenging issue. Hearing about the areas most troubling from a teen's point of view certainly sheds light for any parent stressing over the lingering effects divorce may have on their kids. The expertise from a lifelong psychologist obviously shines through the honest characterization of a difficult subject expressed in this worthwhile DVD.,1347494400,2,418,5.546875
