8441170,2,B004U3O1C6,"I am having a hard time getting my toddler to eat ""people food"" so I took a chance and bought this video. I'm going to admit that I haven't used this video exactly how the producer(s) recommend. The idea is, you give your child some mac and cheese, or some pizza, or a PB&J, or whatever other food is featured on this video, and have your child sit down and watch other children eat the same thing. Maybe if I followed these instructions exactly and my child ate the food after seeing the children on the video eat the food I would feel differently about this video. BUT, as far as the video standing on its own, the entertainment value is TERRIBLE. A child is shown for several minutes trudging through the task of eating one form of food, say a PB&J, while occasionally these cartoon characters come out and say a few things (this borders on a little creepy, by the way). But that's not the worse of it. I could probably deal with that but what I really have a hard time dealing with is the SAME SONG playing OVER and OVER. Could the producer(s) not mix it up a little bit and at least throw in a few different songs? It would make the viewing of it SO much more tolerable and would probably hold the child's interest better also. I know it would mine ;) But since I paid for it and have to deal with it playing in the background I am allowed to have my opinion. Thank you, Amazon, for allowing me to post it!",1393632000,,1411,4.210332103321033
8441171,1,B004U3O1C6,"This is a video of one child at a time, sitting a room alone with a plate of food and eating.  My child was interested in it for about 2 minutes!  It's painfully boring and honestly, I don't know why anyone would even think of making a video like this.  I should've bought the Seasme Street one!  There's these annoying little characters that pop up every now and then and in a boring monotone voice say something...kind of creepy.",1366156800,,431,4.417721518987341
8441172,3,B004U3O1C6,"This video is definitely the right idea, but it only contains foods that most kids already like.  I will say that I have two VERY picky eaters, and they wanted to try macaroni and cheese after watching this.  They eat it all the time now, and sometimes still request to watch the video while they are eating (they are 2 years old).  However, I am looking for something that teaches them to eat foods they don't already like...green beans, carrots, other veggies, mixed foods, etc.  I have searched and searched for something similar to this with the same idea, but have found nothing.",1312329600,,584,4.640776699029126
8441173,4,B004U3O1C6,"My 2-1/2 year old son likes the DVD.  The first couple of times he watched it, he didn't care for it so I thought it wasn't going to work on him.  But now, I estimate that the program works between 60% and 70% of the time depending on his mood.  I wish it works 100% of time, but I'll take what I can get.  I'm just happy that he shows some improvement.  It doesn't work as well for my brother's daughter who is only 13 months old - so it may be an age thing.  I read another parent's review on Amazon that it doesn't work on her baby who only drinks milk.  This company has a website and a video on the website that explains how this video is supposed to work and who it is intended for, and I don't think it was meant for babies that only drink milk.  After all, this video shows foods like chicken nuggets and pizza and I don't think a baby who drinks only milk can jump straight to those kinds of foods.  I'm satisfied.",1306800000,,923,4.0
8441174,1,B004U3O1C6,"I was very happy knowing there is a DVD to help my 15-month baby to eat (she still only likes to drink milk) until I watched the DVD with my daughter. It's VERY BORING! An animated monkey & a little girl came out to say: ""my name is... Let's eat!"". Each chapter, you'll see 1 child sitting at a table eating 1 of the plates mentioned in the DVD (Macaroni & cheese, Chicken nuggets, Pizza, fish sticks, Spaghetti, Peanut butter & jelly sandwich). As the chapters will show kids to eat 6 plates, you'll see the kids sit at the same table eating slowly the food in their plates until it's done or almost done! While the child is eating, either the monkey or the animated girl will come out to say ""yummy!"" or ""good job"" then disappeared.

By looking at the way those children eat, you can tell it's NOT FUN to eat even though sometimes, the kids ... pretended to lick their lips. That makes things very unnatural! I can't believe how boring it is to watch those kids sitting at the same table ALONE eating the plate in front of them! The idea of the DVD is good but the way they made it into a DVD isn't!

Baby signing time DVDs can help much more because you can see more babies eating or drinking & they're really little babies, not big ones like in this DVD (maybe 2 in the DVDs are small ones)... My daughter cried when I tried to make her watch it even I put her on my lap & pointed at the DVD to make her feel it's interesting but it couldn't help! I don't know how it can help other kids to eat by watching this DVD!",1305417600,,1520,4.131756756756757
8441175,4,B004U3O1C6,"I like this video because as a single dad, any help I can get is good.  My daughter has been watching this for a few days now, and she's still not the best eater, but she eats better when I play the video for her.  I think it was worth the money because its saved me a lot of aggravation.",1304208000,,288,3.783333333333333
