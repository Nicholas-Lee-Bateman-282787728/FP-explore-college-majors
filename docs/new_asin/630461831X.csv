I am especially appalled at the knife defense. Should anymore, let alone a woman attempt to defend herself against a knife attack the way it is shown, she will die. I say this as I have studied the art of knife fighting and knife defense for the past 12 years. The basic information is okay, and if someone is buying this tape for the statistics and information only, then its okay. However if anyone feels that these techniques will save them against an aggressive attacker, then they are living on a myth. Mr. DeHook may have been a police trainer, but never in teaching officers how to defend themselves. If you want to buy a tape on self-defense for women, get Mellissa Soalt's Fierce and Female. She is at least credible!",1079740800,13,939,4.562130177514793
