8625730,5,B00GOWI6L8,"I am batting two for two with this second import starring Kirk Douglas. Again a great 1:85 transfer although this time is Eastman Color. Strong direction by Robert Aldrich and excellent support from Rock Hudson, Dorothy Malone, Joseph Cotten and Carol Lynley. Finely wrought script from Dalton Trumbo. Now if this label would release THE LIST OF ADRIAN MESSENGER on blu I would consider the achievement to be the equivalent of a hat trick.",1452643200,,439,4.945945945945946
