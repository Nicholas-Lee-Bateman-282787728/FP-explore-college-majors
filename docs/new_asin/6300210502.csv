7807872,5,6300210502,"I've been trying to get this film for many years, so accepted a pretty good condition ex-rental VHS copy as it's not available on DVD.
Firstly, I must praise the seller of this VHS copy. It was clearly described as good condition ex-rental, so exactly as described. It is certainly in very watchable condition and quality, all things considered. The item was also very well wrapped and protected and arrived entirely undamaged. I'm very pleased that I bought this copy and would certainly buy again from this seller.

The film is a very atmospheric 1970's TV movie remake of Clouzot's Les Diaboliques. Directed by John Badham, it has a classy cast including Tuesday Weld, Joan Hackett and Sam Waterstone. The look, cinematography and setting combine perfectly to support the eerie, beautiful atmosphere of this spooky film, which is slightly reminiscent of 'Child's Play', made a couple of years earlier. This film, however, looks better with the constant drizzle of rain, puddles, gentle grey skies and wet leaves contributing to the feel of the film and the plot. The excellent cast play their parts perfectly: Sam Waterstone is convincingly nasty and brutish; Joan Hackett is intelligently, touchingly vulnerable with a touch of eccentricity; Tuesday Weld is cool, calculating, determined. The unsentimental script is well written, with dialogue above that which you would expect from a TV movie. The music is an adaptation of Bach by Billy Goldenberg, who wrote many excellent TV soundtracks in the 70's, including Columbo and Kojak. Everything works together to support the whole. A modern gothic, moody, atmospheric thriller.",1420243200,2,1631,5.2251908396946565
7807873,5,6300210502,"I love this movie. I'm a big fan of the late Joan Hackett, and Sam Waterston. I think it an improvement on the 1955 French film ""Diabolique."" Seems Hackett did a string of films in the 1970's in which she was ""killed off."" She did it exceptionally well.",1417910400,,253,4.291666666666667
7807874,5,6300210502,"This is a remake of an earlier French movie, but I like this remake so much better.  It kept me on the seat of my chair, and it has so many twists and turns.  This movie held my attention and I was sorry it wasn't another two hours longer.",1396310400,,239,3.857142857142857
7807875,5,6300210502,"Don't get me wrong: the original, ""Diabolique"", is a truly great film. No disputing that. However...

""Reflections of Murder"" was filmed in my hometown, Seattle, in the early '70s which, for me, is a really cool period for the city. (Other films in this mini-genre include ""McQ"" with John Wayne, ""The Parallax View"" with Warren Beatty and, one of my personal favorites, ""99 & 44/100% Dead!"" with Richard Harris.) That skyscraper-less skyline, the urban decay, the rain-drenched dreariness and all that dark, dark wood...ahhh, childhood bliss.

And that's not even to mention this film's own many charms, not the least of which are the two female leads (especially the under-utilized Tuesday Weld), who are in top form; and Sam Waterston is truly repellant as the abusive husband. Also, look for a young Lance Kerwin in an early role.

Rain, rain, don't go away...",1344124800,5,863,5.020979020979021
