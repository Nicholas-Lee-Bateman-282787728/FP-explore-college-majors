7890142,4,6305473404,"I am a huge fan of Terrance Hill and Bud Spencer, and this is a great movie.  I understand these are sellers and not amazon marking up the price.  My question is to these sellers, why such a high price?  Yes, its a great movie and rare, but its a movie!  There is no way I'd pay a hundred bucks for a movie!!  In fact, I don't know anyone who would.  I would love to own this movie.  However, unless the price drops to a very reasonable rate, say forty bucks or under, I can live without it!  Stop price gouging!  Its a great movie.....but its a movie, not a car!!",1184198400,4,564,4.009009009009009
7890143,5,6305473404,"It's wonderful to see Terrence and Bud back again! I've been a fan of Hill and Spencer's work in the Trinity movies for decades. They are one of my favorite comedy teams of all time. I was thrilled when I found out about Troublemakers! I couldn't wait to see it! I was even more thrilled as I watched the movie! Troublemakers is a blast! This is a super treat for fans of Terrence and Bud! This one should have been called Trinity 3.

Fans of the Trinity movies will be very pleased! I loved it!",1113350400,8,495,4.2105263157894735

  This is a 1994 film and much an improvement over the old Italian western films.  After a nine year absence, Terence Hill and Bud Spencer team up again.  Terence Hill is ""Uncle Travis"".  He is looking for his big bear of a brother, ""Moses"".  Travis likes to save a man from a hanging along the way.  Moses has many children who all have bad habits like him. Together Travis and Moses have to trap a Mr. Stone.  These good men even help a boy from a snake bite.  And of course, plenty of beans in this film.  Directed by Terence Hill and shot entirly in New Mexico, USA.  Ruth Buzzi is also in the film.
  DVD contains no extras.  Starts right in to the film or chapter selection with ""Feature Start"".
  For a really good western film and made in America with Terence Hill at his best,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Name-Is-Nobody/dp/B0007M21Z8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Name Is Nobody</a>&nbsp;(1973).

  Note: Bud Spencer said, ""Show me the money first"", in 1994 before the catch- phrase monotonously caught on from the film, Jerry Magire (1996).",1092614400,11,1142,5.108695652173913
7890145,4,6305473404,"I have been a big fan of Terence hill and Bud Spencer since i was in my teens. Being half Italian and English i have seen all of there films over 100 times and never once did i not stop laughing. They bring something on screen together,classic humour and a good buddy buddy movie. Trouble Makers is a third instalment from THEY CALL ME TRINITY saga,they have aged in time and shows it to. Maybe it was better for them not to have made this movie. Terence plays (Travis) the fastest gun in the west,who like always is trying to go after his brother big Bud. Bud who plays (Moses) has now become a family man and doesn't wish to see or know Travis any more. And has one thing on his mind to capture a outlaw by the name of Sam Stone who has a reward of $5,000 on his head. Travis has been ordered by his mother to bring Moses and his children to spend one last Christmas together. It's not that easy when Moses doesn't wish to hear a word from Travis,so sneaky Travis uses his old tricks in the book to persuade Moses in working together so they can capture Sam Stone. This film brings back memories from the duo a lot of shooting and eating beans with a good punch up. If you are a big fan of Terence and Bud then look no further add this to your inventory. The picture quality is very poor in some areas and the sound not to bad,i think the studio must have rushed it. As for the actors i only hope they could have still done more,but age is against them. Nowadays we are missing the good comedy western.",962496000,28,1504,4.154109589041096
