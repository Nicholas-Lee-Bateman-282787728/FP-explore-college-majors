3801561,5,B001UIY5HA,"The show is essentially like Joe Schmo and Joe Schmo 2, but on a much larger scale, with excellent results.  Putting an entire town through the practical joke of staging a movie is such a fun premise, and it was so well done.
I strongly recommend it.",1326844800,3,250,4.319148936170213
3801562,3,B001UIY5HA,"I expected more humor, but it seemed to me to be just kind of a weird experiment. People will do a lot to get a part in the movies. Yep.",1318032000,,136,3.566666666666667
3801563,5,B001UIY5HA,"William Shatner is one of the great actors of the past half century and has worked for me on numerous occassion's with the likes of Katharine Hepburn, Kirk Douglas, Michael Caine, John Hurt,etc. When he does something, he does it brilliantly. This DVD will endear him to you. The show is a rare gem in an age when television has gone straight to hell. I highly recommend this for everyone, not merely Bill's millions of fans.",1311206400,2,425,4.605263157894737
3801564,4,B001UIY5HA,"This DVD is the TV version in that every 45 minutes you have a recap of the previous 45 minutes; they just cut out the TV ads.
Would have been better if it was the movie version like they had on the sci-fi channel.

5 people watched this tape and all 5 were really interested and pleased with it.",1287878400,3,296,4.016949152542373
3801565,5,B001UIY5HA,"This video is a great buy.  I have been unable to find it in most stores, other than the actual museum store in Riverside Iowa, and it was much higher priced.
If you are a fan of William Shatner,or reality TV, you should own this.  It is hilarious and at times touching.  I won't get into what it is about, since anyone can read that in the description section, but I do think this video is an important addition to your video collection.",1279929600,3,438,4.253012048192771
3801566,4,B001UIY5HA,"I found this to be extremely funny, especially being from Iowa.  It is a little on the cheesy side, but for the most part, just good fun.  It was even emotionally touching at times.  It really exposes the kind hearts and hospitality of Iowans.",1253232000,7,243,4.4772727272727275
3801567,4,B001UIY5HA,"Riverside, Iowa is purported to be the town where in the future, James T. Kirk will be born.  It seemed inevitable that William Shatner would show up there sooner or later.  But only Shatner could have pulled off this stunt.  Pretending to be making a sci-fi film using locals, Shatner and his eccentric entourage (improvisational actors playing his dim-witted nephew, buxom ditzy costar, and new age guru) descend on Riverside and commence the wackiest production imaginable.

Spoilers:

Most of the townsfolk seem only too happy to work on the production and indulge Shatner's eccentricities, which include eating off other people's plates, plugging his own brand of berets, and covering for another star's kleptomania.  A younger local suspects very early on that this is a Reality TV gimmick, and he promptly disappears from the production.

Shatner is game throughout, bonding with the people of Riverside and displaying none of the aloofness that some of his Trek costars have accused him of.  He befriends an older man named Don at the local diner (even consenting to having his forehead ""blessed"" by Don's good luck charm which is made from a raccoon's...anatomy).  When they go to visit Don's wife's grave, Shatner, a widower himself, seems genuinely moved.  During the course of his visit, the entourage gets the local townsfolk to open up and discuss their hopes and dreams.  And when the hoax is revealed, most of the locals are relieved that it's a Reality TV stunt, because the ""movie"" they're working on is obviously horrible.  Shatner nearly breaks down in tears as he presents gifts to his new friends, especially the local cue-card holder who is trying to adopt her grandchild.

There are parts midway through the series that drag a bit.  On the whole, however, it's worth sticking with Invasion Iowa for the payoff.  The final episode shows the finished movie, which is so incredibly bad it's hilarious.",1248134400,16,1922,5.037974683544304
3801568,5,B001UIY5HA,"I first saw this when it aired on Spike TV several years ago and kept it on my TIVO for TWO YEARS until I had to switch to DirecTV and sorrowfully lost it.

Why do I love this reality TV sendup so much? (1) William Shatner is a sweetheart. I thought he'd be snarky but instead he (like all of us viewers) falls hard for the people of Riverside, Iowa. (2) Yes, the show manipulates situations for shock value but there's no cruelty or exploitation of the locals who are taken in by the premise (3) William Shatner is the first to laugh at himself and the comedy of his life as Kirk... which gives us license to do so, too and (4) The show is FREAKING HILARIOUS. I live in a multi-story home. My husband works in an office three stories above the TV room. While I watched this show, he had to come down and ask me why in hell I was laughing so hard.",1242691200,36,847,4.07185628742515
3801569,4,B001UIY5HA,"This rating is only relevant for either Trekkies (that's me) or Bill Shatner fans (he has some from Boston Legal apparently).  If you are not in either of those categories you might enjoy the DVD but you probably wouldn't give it four stars.
I really liked all of the people in this - the actors and the townspeople, once I got to know them.  At first I thought I'd be watching a lot of typical Americans doing typically American TV things.  My first impressions were way out.  I loved the way the viewer really gets to know the townspeople. I particularly misjudged Scotty, who I thought was your typical rednecked macho man.  He's actually a caring, sensitive, wonderful man.  The series surely must have boosted tourism to this small town.
I love the juxtaposition of reality and fantasy, especially the fact that this town advertises itself as the future birthplace of Captain James T Kirk.",1393459200,,894,4.735483870967742
3801570,2,B001UIY5HA,"This is probably the worst film Shatner ever made, Watching it is like watching paint dry. I live just a few miles from Riverside Iowa and even though I know quite a few people in the film it still sucks.",1392681600,,204,4.125
3801571,5,B001UIY5HA,william shatner comes to riverside iowa to make a fake film but the relationship they have with the people turns into love as they give the stars in the movie money for their dreams and money is given to the town.,1388793600,,213,4.219512195121951
3801572,5,B001UIY5HA,I love watching everything that William Shatner does.  It was very funny and it is great how he pokes fun at himself.,1388793600,,117,4.318181818181818
3801573,5,B001UIY5HA,"If you're a Shatner/Star Trek fan you will really love this. This is not belly laughs but plenty of fun and Shatner's humanity shines through nicely. He may have an ego but he has a sense of humor about himself and he really cares about people which is clearly evident in this short reality series. He makes it clear he doesn't want to make the town look stupid and they don't. Really what Shatner's improv acting troupe does is make themselves look foolish and catch the town's reaction to these crazy Hollywood types.

If you don't like Shatner or bad sci fi movies this is not for you.",1384646400,,588,4.444444444444445
3801574,4,B001UIY5HA,"Interesting feature which ties Shatner & Kirk to Iowa, the conical birthplace of James T. Kirk.  However,
Roswell has the main focus of ET invasions.",1369180800,,149,4.96
3801575,4,B001UIY5HA,"The product shipped quickly and was good quality.

Had The Joe Schmo Show 1 not existed, this would have easily earned 5 stars.  But every reality show with a mark always has to be compared to Joe Schmo.  I love these types of shows and wish there were more, but understand the difficulties in producing them.

I have a feeling that after the reveal to the ""actors"" they decided to edit it differently so as not to portray the town as rubes, not that I think they are rubes.  In fact every person in the ""movie"" and the townspeople shown all come off as lovable.",1361059200,,562,4.314285714285714
3801576,3,B001UIY5HA,This is for people who love Shatner. It's reality television so you've seen all these types of tricks and people before but it is fun to watch him preen and poke fun at himself. Sometimes people call him Kirk by mistake,1357344000,,219,4.365853658536586
3801577,1,B001UIY5HA,"Not what I expected- more of a documentary of tricking the town than showing making a movie & then showing the blow off  that it was fake. Still viewing the last disc. Creative tricks pulled on the towns folk.
No subtitles- hard to hear. Subtitles would have made it easier to follow.",1353974400,2,284,4.461538461538462
3801578,4,B001UIY5HA,"As with most other reviewers here, I think that INVASION IOWA is fun to watch, and is often warm and touching too. The 2 DVDs contain 10 episodes, each 30 minutes long. I first watched this with a group of people, and we agreed that the show went where none of us had gone before on TV, with me the one exception since I had seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Joe-Schmo-Show-Season-One-Uncensored/dp/B0001XAODO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Joe Schmo Show - Season One Uncensored</a>&nbsp;that was similar in setting up a fake film production. As you've probably read already, INVASION IOWA involves William Shatner and his cohorts from Hollywood ""invading"" the small town of Riverside, Iowa, supposedly to film a science fiction movie, yet the movie is actually fake and the whole purpose is to film a reality TV show ABOUT the townspeople thinking they are making a movie. It's interesting to see how the people of Riverside react to the situation, and most of them are very warm, welcoming, and excited to be the setting for a movie. Also, several people from the town are cast in the ""movie."" Shatner clearly drives the proceedings with his humor and his ability to bond with the townspeople.

There's a good deal of comedy in this, but as William Shatner pointed out in the commentary (which he does with 2 producers on 2 episodes) and in his book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Up-Till-Now-The-Autobiography/dp/B0031MA8P6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Up Till Now: The Autobiography</a>, the original plan was to derive most of the humor from making the townspeople look foolish. But Shatner and others making the show decided that was too mean-spirited, so they decided instead to make THEMSELVES look foolish and thus make the show a spoof on Hollywood. The plan worked well, with one of the funniest running jokes being a guy repeatedly phoning in and impersonating Sean Connery, who supposedly was going to appear in the movie. This fake Connery was very difficult to please and foul-mouthed, but the townspeople were still excited at the thought of the great Sean Connery coming to Riverside. Another funny gag was Shatner's doofus body double who continually messed up the production. And since I mentioned THE JOE SCHMO SHOW earlier, I'll note that it and INVASION IOWA were made by the same production company. I think INVASION IOWA is the better of the two programs, partly because SCHMO was fooling only one guy, whereas IOWA is fooling a whole town, and also because SCHMO got into these drawn-out interpersonal conflicts that were not even real because everybody but Joe was a fake character, whereas IOWA keeps a lot more variety going.

INVASION IOWA drags a bit around the middle as the humor wanes, so a couple of episodes get rather tedious. Sometimes INVASION IOWA gets bogged down in showing the process of making their ""movie."" And I think the segments with the actress Desi Lydic describing her children's book to the townspeople don't work very well. Why didn't they just have her strut around more in her eye-popping alien outfit? Yum Yum!! However, toward the end INVASION IOWA picks up steam again, culminating in an episode where Shatner spills the beans to the townspeople that all this is just a fake. The tenth and final episode is the fake movie they had been making.

All in all, INVASION IOWA is a fun and interesting mini-series that I do recommend, not just to William Shatner fans, but to anyone who enjoys reality TV.",1327276800,3,3550,5.2027972027972025
8343885,5,B001UIY5HA,"This is the most hilarious video I've ever seen. William Shatner goes to the Iowa town where Captain Kirk was born and makes a sci-fi movie with the townspeople. It turns out that...well, you'll have to see it yourself to see how it turns out.",1525392000,,243,4.4222222222222225
8343886,4,B001UIY5HA,"William Shatner's INVASION IOWA is a lot of fun. There are only 10 episodes, so the series never overstays its welcome. I'm so thankful that Mr. Shatner and his crew decided to get the laughs at THEIR expense, rather than the good folks of Riverside. Instead of being cruel and mean-spirited, the show comes off as lighthearted, funny and, at times, quite poignant. Try and watch the ninth episode (the big reveal) and not get a lump in your throat. The emotion shown by Mr. Shatner and his actors is real.

Speaking of emotion, it was really nice to see William Shatner's warmth and humanity on full display. He pokes fun at his image throughout the series, but never at the townspeople. When he escorts an elderly resident to the cemetery to visit the grave of the man's wife, Mr. Shatner is genuinely moved. His kind words resonate deeply with the elderly man -- and the audience.

William Shatner's INVASION IOWA isn't for everyone, particularly in today's post-modern world of ""punking"". But if you're looking for a fun, poignant slice of middle America, give it a try.",1504051200,,1074,4.737967914438503

8343891,5,B001UIY5HA,"I am guessing not many are aware of this because it only aired once... appropriately on April Fool's Day weekend. This is more than a reality tv show. This is William Shatner at his most endearing, joking, and wicked sense of humor. It's amazing what was probably planned out ahead of time for this practical joke to last a full week of episodes. The gimmick is that Bill has come with made-for-tv rate production crew to film a sci-fi movie in Iowa. Nobody knows it has practical jokes. The whole thing is a stunt. What I love is that this ""stunt"" has wonderful fun poked at Hollywood industry cliches. There's a flaky actress, a new-age guru, and a stern executive, to name a few. I very much wish this had bonus features explaining how they put this practical joke together. I shouldn't overdo the practical joke aspect of it because you get to see what this Iowa town is like. You become familiar with the locals as fun people to meet. Warm-hearted, inside-humor.",1431475200,,967,4.595375722543353
