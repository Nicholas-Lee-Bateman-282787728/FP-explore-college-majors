I had watched anime series like Wolf's Rain, Chrono Crusade, Fullmetal Alchemist, Hellsing, Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex Committee, and the obnoxious Inuyasa.  But after watching Ragnarok in Japanese on YouTube, I think to myself. Couldn't there had been more to this anime? But than again, this anime was a rip-off the Role Playing Online Game. Being so, I guess the series couldn't be that long, but come on, at least we can have some better fighting scenes, or more dramatic moments?
For example, when Iruga (Or Iluga, however you wish to spell it) fights with his two Katars, he attacks once or maybe even twice, and all we see is him jumping towards his enemy than suddenly falls over and clutches his side in pain, you don't even see the action of him cutting into his opponent or any detailed cuts that he might had sustained. I keep on thinking, isn't he an assassin? Couldn't he just be a little bit faster, or a little more deadly? Maybe I'm just being too picky? Could we at least see them slashing at each other?
Basically, the dramatic scenes weren't that dramatic to me, maybe because I was watching them talk in Japanese, and reading the text took away that. But basically, if you want to watch a nice, short series of medieval adventures, which includes a swordsman, a acolyte,  a sorceress, a merchant, an assassin and his lover hunter, than you will like Ragnarok. Not that I didn`t like it, I wouldn`t have given it 4 stars. But like I pointed out, this series could had been touched up in a few places.
Anyway, this series is all based around six characters who are trying to stop the Dark Lord from rising again. The Dark Lord must gather the seven ambitions of humankind which sealed him away long ago. The three people who work under him that are killing a being that has one of the seven ambitions in him in order to arise him, is a half human/half demon, a corrupted, hateful knight and a mad wizard who seeks the truth. Than there is the baphomet, a huge goat-like monster who seems to be working for evil but really isn't, he only seeks to bring down the Dark Lord. Than there is Melopsum, a shape-shifting witch who also seeks the same goal, and helps Roan, the swordsman, achieve his goal of being able to protect Yufa throughout his quest.
Roan is the main character of this series, he is a swordsman, is deeply in-love with Yufa and just wants to gain her attention. Before he came to be with the rest of the six adventures of this series, he traveled with his childhood friend, Yufa, the acolyte and her brother Keough, and his best friend Iruga. After Keough was supposedly killed by one of the Dark Lord's minions in Glast Heim, a quest Iruga and Keough were sent on to investigate the place, Iruga got Yufa and Roan out of danger and shut the gate so the evil couldn't escape. Than they split up, Yufa going with Roan and Iruga venturing off into the Lost Forest alone.
Than Roan and Yufa meet up with Takius, a blindfolded sorceress who seeks the ""ultimate truth,"" bestrode on her by her mad master, Zephyr. She is soon followed by Maya, the lighthearted, greedy merchant and her little pink friend, Poy Poy. And last Iruga and Judia join them and the party of six ventures off to save Keough and stop the Dark Lord from rising.
This series reminded me of Chrono Crusade and Inuyasa, so if you enjoyed ether one, than you should enjoy this anime series, which has 26 episodes.",1211760000,2,3513,4.522012578616352
8228566,4,B000XJD3ES,"I first saw Ragnarok on IGN when they were previewing it shortly before its release.  When I first saw this anime, the story immediately reminded me of the Tales games and I was in for a great experience.  I bought the first volume and watched all nine episodes and came to a conclusion that it was not as engaging as I had first thought.  It is still a great story with memorable characters and great action, drama, and comedy but it is slow coming along and the villains have barely been shown.  I believe the next volume will fix this and I hope the animation is a little bit clearer.  Anyone interested in a great anime story will be guaranteed lots of action and romance should check this out right away! Oh and I thought it was kinda neat they put nine episodes in each volume.  I only wish they would do that with more anime.",1204416000,,832,4.301282051282051
