7972240,4,B00006LSEK,"This volume has some wonderful episodes on it.
""Shock, Horror"" - The weakest episode on the disc, but still wonderful. Ollie is ill and George keeps popping home to see how he is during rescues, finally being tracked there by a reporter who thinks Janet is having an affair with Thermoman, then that Ollie is an illegitimate child, then that Thermoman and George are having an affair.
Best Moment: Probably discovering that Piers tweaked his A-Levels in medical school, after using examples that makes Janet thinks he dislikes her hair and her cooking.
""Little Green Man"" - Arnie shares carrot cake with Janet, therefore breaking the protocols of Tallitos and making George so jealous that he literally turns green.
Best Moment: George pretending to be jealous. ""Oh, Tyler this, Tyler that! You'll break my heart!""
""Mine's A Double"" - George gets a double called Hilary who is nothing but trouble, flirting with Ella, sneaking into the shower with Janet, and then framing George for stealing a bike, causing him to lose his powers.
Best Moment: George feeling pain when he loses his powers, even when Janet simply kisses him. ""Ouch! I think you've bruised my lips.""
""A Little Learning"" - When George is excluded from Ella and Stanley's Ruby Wedding party, George uses pork scratchings which causes Ultrons to know everything, now showing himself as the most knowledgeable person, liked by everyone except his family.
Best Moment: George, trying to make new friends, innocently invites prostitutes over.
""A Day To Remember"" - George erases his own memory, forgetting he is Thermoman, and a meteor is heading towards Earth, ready to obliterate everyone.
Best Moment: Mrs Raven's T-shirt ""We're all gonna die in the morning"".
Overall, a great playlist of episodes.",1394582400,,1761,5.075862068965518
7972241,5,B00006LSEK,"This is simply the best season in the series.  ""Pet Rescue,"" about the conversations between George and that little dog are absolutely hilarious.  I live in the US (so I do not have a PAL format DVD player), but I was able to play this DVD perfectly in my notebook computer.  I mention that so other American fans of this show will be able to watch it in the PAL format since it was never released for the USA.  The packaging and shipping were superb.  I got the DVD in perfect condition and in record time.",1359936000,4,507,4.239583333333333
7972242,5,B00006LSEK,"Oh, those Brits and their whimsical humor. One of my favorite sitcoms is BBC's MY HERO, a half-hour series that comically explores the domestic misadventures of Thermoman (Ardal O'Hanlon), dimwit alien superhero from the planet Ultron. When not performing feats of world-saving import, Thermoman, in his guise as mild-mannered shop owner George Sunday, strives to live the humdrum life of the average British subject. Series 3, with its ten madcap episodes, ushers in the new addition to the Sunday household: George and his wife Janet's baby boy. Episode One deals with, among other things, the baby's as yet undetermined name: Will it be ""Pontius Ulrich Sunday"" or ""Benjamin""? (It's actually Ollie, short for Apollo 11.) George and Janet (particulary Janet) find themselves at wit's end coping with young Ollie's precocious ways, what with his having taken after his da. One day after his birth, and Ollie is already conversing with the 'rents and zooming around the room. On the plus side, his poo does smell like strawberries and cream.

I'm amazed but glad that the U.S. hadn't picked up MY HERO to bastardize. As ever, Irish comedian Ardal O'Hanlon is fantastic, but, really, so is the rest of the cast. You'll be glad to hear that O'Hanlon's Thermoman enters new realms of obliviousness as he's still suffering from a serious case of culture clash. It's not that he's a simpleton, really. Thermoman is, in fact, innately very intelligent. It's just that he just can't seem to get a firm grip on Earthly customs, and his goof-ups are then perceived as stupidity. Thermoman is so very literal, and his lack of tact keeps landing him in hot water and often results in demented plot situations.

The lovely Emily Joyce, playing the long-suffering, understanding Janet, continues her run as the show's unsung heroine. But the secret weapon is Geraldine McNulty as the miserable receptionist Mrs. Raven. The zingers are wicked fun and constant, with the diabolical Mrs. Raven and George hogging the most choice one-liners. And the baby shifts the group dynamics and adds new dimensions of humor. He's very cute, and it tickles me each time fully constructed sentences come out of his mouth. And, yes, young Ollie does demonstrate that he's more worldly than his da.

Although Series One and Two are available on DVD, in Region 1 format, Series 3 - broken up into two volumes - is still only available in Region 2, so you'll need an All Region (or is it Regions Free?) DVD player. Especially since rumor has it that Series 4, 5, and 6 will be released sometime later on this year. MY HERO Series 3, Vol. 2 contains the final five episodes of Series 3:

- Episode 6 - ""Shock, Horror!"" - Concern over the baby's high temperature takes a toll on George's superheroing. One fallout: a sleazy tabloid newspaperman captures a photo of Thermoman caught in George and Janet's home. Oh, the escalating headlines, as George feverishly tries to salvage the situation.

- Episode 7 - ""Little Green Man"" - When Arnie shares his cake with Janet, thus inadvertently breaking a sacred convention of Ultron marriage, George literally turns green with envy.

- Episode 8 - ""Mine's A Double"" - Scheduled to attend an Ultron superhero function, George introduces Janet to his replacement double.

- Episode 9 - ""A Little Learning"" - George's unending social blunders compel him to fly back to Ultron for a remedy. He returns to Earth knowing everything about everything and, as a result, is now more polished in his casual conversations with humans. But, and we saw this coming, the remedy has nasty side effects.

- Episode 10 - ""A Day to Remember"" - George loses his memory just as a hurtling meteor threatens to annihilate all life on Earth. Or is he just pretending so he can get out of changing the baby's nappies?
