If you loved ""Jab we Met,"" than you will surely love this film too. Yes, it's a simple love story between a couple of college kids, but I also liked the fact that most Hindi films are based on family values, which in today's society happens to be almost non existent in certain parts of the world. What's wrong with just a sweet, simple love story? Check out the two new main characters, Akshay Oberoi and Sandepa Dhar. Not only are they great to look at, but their acting skills were amazing! I would have never known they were new to the film industry, their acting was so polished, but never boring.  The musical numbers were fantastic, so much so, that you'll find yourself humming the tunes, even after the movie is over. The scenes where they used the play as parts of the movie were not overplayed and they fit in perfectly. The whole cast was wonderful and that special appearance by Salman Khan.(always looking great)!!! Wow, what more can I say! See this movie!!!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Isi-Life-Mein-Hindi-Film-Bollywood-Movie-Indian-Cinema-DVD/dp/B004PZI02G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Isi Life Mein (Hindi Film / Bollywood Movie / Indian Cinema DVD)</a>",1350777600,2,1355,5.187214611872146
