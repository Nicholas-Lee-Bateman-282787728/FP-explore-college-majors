I know that he is using techniques that have been around for thousands of years, but the way he presents them, makes it easy to learn and master in mere hours. I was very excited to receive the Rapid Assault Tactics (R.A.T.) DVD in the mail, and it was everything that I thought it would be. I believe that this system as well as anything else created by Mr. Vunak will serve us very well in this post-9/11 world.",1264032000,2,450,4.244186046511628
8177751,5,B000NHZ7JO,"Great presentation of some very practical techniques for street fighting and the interactive mode for training the defensive moves and counters is a fantastic training tool.  It will definitely train your nervous system well to have sharper reflexes.  I trained with Paul Vunak personally back in 2001 and we trained in these techniques, as well as some others.  It was great to do private training with him as he is truly one of those very committed teachers.  This video is a really great tool for practice on your own and with a partner.  There are sections that are good for both.",1254096000,4,584,4.742574257425742
