4066249,1,B00342ANSK,What are u kidding me?  This is definetly a home made movie.  The acting is horrible and is nothing like an 80's horror movie.  Even the actors in the 80's can act better than this.,1364256000,2,181,4.114285714285714
4066250,1,B00342ANSK,"This Movie is a total waste of time and Money. Theres no meaning or plot to this, very poor scenery, and very bad acting",1358985600,,120,4.041666666666667
4066251,1,B00342ANSK,Poor excuse for a horror film. Low or maybe no budget. I threw it away after watching it.,1284508800,3,89,4.0
4066252,4,B00342ANSK,This movie was not available to put in my Neflix queue yet and I really wanted to see it so I purchased a copy here on amazon. I'm glad I did. There are so many B rated horror movies that are pure junk and total waste of money but this one actually keeps you entertained throughout the whole thing. I have seen a lot of movies and I always enjoy more suspense than I do gore and while this movie has some gore- it is heavy on suspense. It is very low budget but it works for this movie really well with the grainy feel to it.  The idea is very original- there are two killers in this movie so there is really no down time at all LOL I have to say this is  probably one of the first horror movies where you are on the edge of your seat but then laughing at the same time.  This movie is definitely worth the money but if you are not sure- rent it first and then you can purchase one because you will want to watch this one again.  This one was a lot of fun. I really enjoyed it. 4.5/5,1272585600,9,983,3.8756218905472637
4066253,5,B00342ANSK,"This movie was awesome! This movie reminds me of the movies I grew up with and I love slasher movies from the 80's. There were so many parts, that were good. The scream at the beginning just sets the whole mood for the movie. That guy Warren wilcox is super freaky looking. The kids are relatable, it makes you think this could really happen. I never knew what to expect, it's not the typical Jason with machete kinda movie! The ending is good, again not what you would expect, I would definitely recommend this movie!",1267488000,10,518,4.463157894736842
8388164,1,B00342ANSK,wow....what a terrible movie.  I tried to skip through a lot of it and eventually just turned it off.,1494547200,,101,4.315789473684211

8388168,2,B00342ANSK,"The Terror Factor was a big disappointment. I waited forever this film to be released, seems the wait was a waste. Not worth your time to watch.",1396483200,,144,4.37037037037037
8388169,5,B00342ANSK,"Fun indie film filmed by locals.  Lots of humor, blood, and guts.  Old school slasher film style make this a must watch. Cheesy acting makes it all that much better to watch.",1385251200,,174,4.40625
8388170,1,B00342ANSK,its good that the movie was free because I don't think I would pay to see it and no one else I know would,1377820800,,105,3.4166666666666665
8388171,1,B00342ANSK,"Is there a zero star or a negative star?

I canceled my Netflix subscription because of the abundance of no-name amateur movies there.

It appears that Amazon takes a page from Netflix.

Is this thing a movie or some redneck home video?

Some advice to the entrepreneurs that want to profit from this idiotic media gold rush:

Do not shoot your movie in dark.

Make sure your budget actor do not smile on the job.",1370995200,2,413,4.44
8388172,3,B00342ANSK,"Not too bad for a low budget horror flick.  I love horror so I'll watch almost anything, so if you are like me, you will like it enough to watch the whole movie...:)",1368748800,6,165,4.0
