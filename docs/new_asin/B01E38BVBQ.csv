8757572,2,B01E38BVBQ,"Morris (Tony Curran) lives on the Moors. He owns a wrecker and has a nefarious watch collection. As he is about to add to his collection, his daughter (Diana Vickers) interrupts him and Jake (Rupert Hill) becomes a house guest in what comes initially as a farmer's daughter joke. Jake's desire to leave meets with resistance from Morris who operates a profitable business.
