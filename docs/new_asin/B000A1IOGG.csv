2350137,4,B000A1IOGG,"While not exactly a 'part 2' kind of sequel to Welcome to the Dollhouse, Palindromes is more than a film just set in the same universe. Several characters from Dollhouse are featured and many references are made to events in said previous movie. It's best to be familiar with Dollhouse first before watching Palindromes.

Dawn Weiner, our lovely protagonist from Dollhouse, is dead. She committed suicide after getting pregnant from a date-rape. And even in death people cannot hold back on talking trash about her. Her 12-year-old cousin Aviva (she IS 12, a lot of people are mentioning various ages, she only turns 13 at the end) is so affecting by her tragic life that she vows to never turn out like her.

Her mum (Ellen Barkin who appears to have had some dodgy face-lift) promises that will never happen as she loves Aviva more than Dawn's family loved her. Which could not be further than the truth. As soon as she becomes pregnant to some horny boy Aviva's mum shows her true colors. She is selfish, ignorant and downright cruel. Her dad also. They may well be angry but that's no excuse for the pressure they put her under.

Aviva is forced into having an abortion. But it goes wrong and she ends up having an emergency hysterectomy. Thinking only of the effect it has upon herself, Aviva's mum keeps this part secret from her. Obviously devastated at the lost of her unborn child, Aviva takes off on a journey to find a new lover and make a new baby, unaware that she never will.

Upon this journey Aviva is played by many different actresses, all of whom portray her with the same facial expressions and mannerisms. She meets a variety of characters, including her cousin Mark (Dawn's older brother), a trucker who isn't a pedo but loves her anyway and family of disabled Jesus loving Christians who secretly fund abortionist assassinations.

It's bizarre and sometimes outrageous journey full of some typical Todd Solondz moments; scenes where the far-fetched becomes very believable because human-nature often stretches beyond normality when no one is looking. It was sad to see that Mark Weiner's life ruined in the way that it is. But he came through as a more mature and sympathetic character than the bully older brother he was before. And he did have some good scenes.

Now, about the whole pre-teen sexuality thing. I do not have a problem with this but I know a lot of people do. I don't find anything offensive about it but this is the third time Solondz has tackled the subject. Is he into it? Is he against it? Does he find it humorous? Or does he just use it as an easy way to rile us up and make us react? While it's integral to the story, it's not anything a fan of Solondz hasn't seen before.

Palindromes more than about a girl who's name is the spelled forwards as backwards. It's a film about how life goes around in circles and no one really ever changes or goes anywhere. It sounds like a pointless journey when I put it that way. But it's worth it.",1130284800,3,2981,4.581613508442777
2350138,4,B000A1IOGG,"""Palindrome"" is a provocative film, not because of its subject matter, but because of writer-director Todd Solondz's conceit.  The story is about Aviva, a 12-year-old girl, who becomes pregnant.  The conceit is that Aviva is played by eight different people, one of who is male, one of whom is a lot younger than 12, and one of whom is obviously a lot older since she is played by Jennifer Jason Lee.  Some of the Avivas are white and some are black.  By playing with the variables of age, race, gender, and even body type, Solondz forces viewers to ask themselves what different they make in our feelings towards the character.  If a grown woman gets pregnant the human calculus is decided different than if it is a little girl gets pregnant, and Solondz blatantly throws these variables into the face of his viewers.  He assumes that your sympathies change as he alters the variables, and ultimately the big question is what makes them change and how much?

Given this sort of psychological assault by Solodnz it is probably not surprising that I was drawn to the Aviva who said nothing.  But I was also aware that there were a couple of Avivas that I considered to be more ""real"" than others.  I think I have convinced myself because those were the ones that seemed most appropriate to the situation as that of a young girl who fancies the idea of having a baby the way she would have thought about playing with dolls only a few years earlier.  Of course, judging the different Avivas by a personal standard is exactly the inevitable response to this 2004 film that Solondz expects, and that invites self-examination as to why you are thinking what you are thinking.  This is obviously not a film designed to make you comfortable, which is certainly something I can support, but in the end I am not sure what we do once we recognize our peculiar responses.  Being aware that the fact we judge human beings by such variables does not stop us from continuing to do so.  Then again, since these are hard questions there is no reason to expect anything close to easy answers, and more than a few viewers will simply not want to play this little game.

I have to add that I really did not think that ""Palindrome"" was a film about abortion.  If you are talking about a young girl becoming pregnant I would think abortion is an inevitable part of the discussion that follows, whether it is immediately embraced or instantly rejected.  On this score it seems to me that Solondz is pretty even handed, since I was as offended by Joyce's attempts to cajole her daughter into having one as I was by Peter Paul finding aborted fetuses to show her in the dump.  I read what happens at the end with Joe/Earl/Bob in New Jersey at the end of the film as being more about what is essentially a botched abortion rather than for the idea of abortion, but I fully understand that others will see that as being on point with regards to that topic.  That divergent opinion simply speaks to how ""Palindrome"" is a cinematic Rorschach test and that beyond provoking his audience Solondz does not have a specific agenda.",1130198400,,3097,4.569620253164557
2350139,3,B000A1IOGG,"It seemed like this movie tried to come off and bold, shocking and controvercial but came off as perverse. I am a big fan of ""Happiness"" and enjoyed ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" and "" Storytelling"", other movies by this director. This movie was a bit weak for me and dragged along. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it was fresh and had a couple of good lines. I don't think I would get anything from repeated viewings so I wouldn't suggest to buy this movie, rent it instead.",1130025600,2,495,4.276595744680851
2350140,4,B000A1IOGG,"The other reviewers have written generously on this movie, so I will just add a few of my own thoughts:

Aviva is a girl bound to failure and misery at every turn.  Her first time (or, so we think) is with a semi-misanthropic young man who clumsily inseminates her.  The resulting pregnancy drives her unhappy mother to drag her to get an abortion, which ends with the doctor revealing that a hysterectomy had to be performed.  To add to the tragedy, the cowardly parents lie to her, and say she is just fine.  With her deep desire for children, Aviva continues trying to get pregnant, not knowing that it's all in vain.  The kicker is that the sex act itself isn't even worth it, since she winds up with losers like the Joe/Earl/Bob character, a dumpy man who couldn't get a date with a real woman to save his life.

Not all of the Avivas get an equal turn at bat.  The Aviva who gets an abortion enjoys plenty of camera time, while the Huckleberry Aviva gets just a brief scene with no lines.

Some reviewers say that the Mama Sunshine sequence tips the abortion argument in favor of the pro-life movement. If we just met and heard Mama Sunshine, maybe this would be a valid point.  The ugly part comes when the loser Earl, Mama Sunshine's husband Beau, and Dr. Dan are in the basement.  Dr. Dan, who examined Aviva without her consent when she was out cold, reveals her to be a ""child whore."" Beau declares that he has never had a ""slut"" in his house before.  Little do they know that Aviva is hiding out in the basement, listening to their every word.  Suddenly, her momentary sense of respite and belonging is shattered, because of a couple of comments by some bigoted, patriarchal extremists.  Even as she gets ready to run away, she says goodbye to a boy who whispers ""harlot"" in his sleep.

The point that I'm trying to make is that as much of a selfish you-know-what that Aviva's mother is, the Sunshine clan is more sinister, hiding their ugly prejudices behind a veneer of happiness and acceptance.

The rest of the movie finds Aviva constantly being used, let down, lectured to, and deceived.  She runs into Judah again, the boy who impregnated her, and now calls himself Otto.  After a drive in the woods, he has sex with her, and ruins the act by cursing his premature ejaculation.  Aviva morphs into different versions of herself during the sex act, and afterwards becomes the little black girl from the beginning, who breaks your heart by uttering a positive, self-affirmating statement.",1129507200,8,2503,4.584269662921348
2350141,4,B000A1IOGG,"Solondz excels at making films which mesmerize. Along with ""Happiness"" and ""Storytelling"", this one just commands your total attention because you simply do not know what's coming, kept in thrall. The dinner table scene is so strange, so eminently bizarre. I just cannot get over how freakish a scene it is, how everyone is directed, how oddly it is edited together. That's Solondz for you; a director for whom each new work is eagerly anticipated. I loved this film. You won't find any extras here - and that's not a bad thing in this instance. You watch a film like this, and you almost don't want to know much about it's production. I don't want to know where the kids came from. I don't want to know about who did this or that. It's just this small gem you appreciate as is, no backstory. There is an insert inside the case featuring some of Solondz' thoughts. The film isn't captioned or subtitled. It IS anamorphic (thankfully).",1127520000,5,934,4.632530120481928
2350142,4,B000A1IOGG,"Solondz has not reached the heights of success he enjoyed with Happiness, Welcome to the Dollhouse, and Story Telling. However, there is a lot to recommend in Palindromes. The story is simple enough. A teenage girl, desperate for love and repelled by her selfish parents, runs away and meets all variety of mentally sick people on the way. As in most Solendz films, characters assert a facade of overdone piety and sanctimony that quickly dissolves and reveals a virulent selfishness, helplessness, and rage. Solendz has a theme, which is voiced by one of the characters, Mark Weiner, the older brother of Dawn Weiner, both of whom were featured in Welcome to the Dollhouse. Mark says we are all helpless, overtaken by our biology, completely absent of free will, completely powerless to change our lives. This helplessness is strongly articulated in the film but it is also the film's weakness: Watching helpless characters flailing in agony with no hope of change eliminates any kind of tension or narrative power, of which this film has little or none. The characters are shrill, self-pitying, effete, whining waifs who indulge in lugubrious melodrama. At times, their indulgences, their delusions, and their tantrums are so over the top that the film achieves a certain type of slapstick comedy. But the level of mental derangement coupled with helpless characters could be off-putting for many viewers.

Final comment: There is a section, my favorite part, where a dozen handicapped children are under the care of a Mrs. Sunshine, a religious fanatic matriarch. Their talk of being in a loving, happy family is scripted. They come across as happy-talk androids. Mrs. Sunshine is a desperate, lonely women. It appears this section of the film had to be inspired by the award-winning documentary My Flesh and Blood, about a lonely single mother who adopts handicapped children.

Strange film indeed. If you're a Solendz fan, then for sure you'll enjoy much in Palindromes. Just don't expect it to be as good as his best.",1126915200,8,2023,5.053892215568863
2350143,5,B000A1IOGG,Todd Solondz has to be one of my favorite film directors out there. not like one of his movies are my favorite movie of all time or anything. but every movie he does has something i want to see in it or something that appeals to me people that I can relate too. in this story you see young children not only having sex but wanting to have their own children. by the end of the movie i was confused about what todd was really saying. is it pro life or pro choice. now I asumme it is about both. it really is a pretty simple story as it goes along but todd really draws you in with the the diffrent people that play his female lead. my very favorite part in the whole movie is at the end where the little girl says I think I am going to be a mom. this might noit be the best movie in the world but it kept my interest for an hour and 40 mins.,1126915200,2,840,3.8333333333333335
2350144,2,B000A1IOGG,"If I give only two stars to 'Palindromes,' that's not because the hot subject matters it deals with, like abortion and religion.  I really liked Solondz's 'Happiness,' which is probably his best film so far, and it included child molester and tellephone stalker.  No, I am very disappointed with the way the film's story was told.

The story is told in a mock fairy tale style.  It's about a girl named Aviva, who after being pregnant and experiencing terrible things after that (and her parents would not listen to her), she runs away from her home, and finds another family in the community in which children (many of whom are handicapped) read the Bible, sing religious songs, and pray for the God.  But you know, this is only the beginning of more shocking incidents that follow.

[EIGHT 'AVIVA' ACTORS] Solondz thought of curious idea, which is, as previous reviewer says, that Aviva should be played by eight actors (and one of them is a boy).  It doesn't work.  I imagine he wanted to give the character of Aviva kind of everywoman quality, but the results are only irritating.

Because of this strange decision, 'Aviva' is a detached, cold presence that few viewers can relate to, and that's a big problem because the success of Solondz's films like 'Happiness' clearly lies in Solondz's convincing characters. In 'Happiness' they do or suffer terrible things, but we are invited to share their viewpoints.  In 'Palindromes' the central character becomes a cypher.  Some viewers would be either impressed or shocked, even offended to see his satire about social issues like abortion represented by two portraits of 'American' family.  To me, however, the most unpleasant thing about the film is to watch Solondz, who created good characters in the past, is getting more and more self-indulgent like in 'Storytelling.'

[HAVE TO WAIT LONG TO SEE JENNIFER JASON LEIGH] But this problem could be solved by casting good actors in the role.  No, sorry to say this, but few of the eight actors are good, and poor acting doesn't help when Aviva must look like a woman who desperately seeks for love.  Real pro gives some help when Jennifer Jason Leigh appears as Aviva, but too late (she is the last Aviva, and stays in the film very briefly).  Ellen Barkin as Aviva's mother is excellent, and other supports are all good.  And for Aviva, we need someone who can act, like Jane Adams, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Dylan Baker (all fantastic in 'Happiness') or Heather Matarazzo (yes, the poor girl in 'Welcome to the Dollhouse').

And ... Dawn is dead.  I don't know why, but in 'Parindromes' Solondz killed his own character Dawn, heroine of his praised 'Wellcome to the Dollhouse.'  (Actually, Aviva is her relative).  But why did he do that?  Like this unnecessary move (and some would take it as real sin), sometimes it seems as if Solondz just doesn't know what he is doing in 'Palindrome' when his success is due to his talent to create convincing characters, not kill them.",1126742400,3,2976,4.816929133858268
2350145,4,B000A1IOGG,"Aviva is a 13 year old girl who wants to get pregnant, and will go to any length to achieve her goal. Solondz's newest movie is disturbing, covering taboo subjects as pedophilia, abortion and religion fundamentalism. Using 7 different actors for Aviva is an interesting spin for the movie. Solondz covers hard topics with some black humor and a lot of intelligence.",1126656000,,365,4.903225806451613
2350146,5,B000A1IOGG,Todd Solondz has done it again - perhaps with a greater ferver and sharpness than his previous film Happiness. Why is this film wrong? Well it challenges you on your moral outlook on life - it does so by taking the issue of abortion. Most people fit into the pro life ot pro choice camps but what this film does is takes you to the extreme on both sides and makes you feel uncomfortable that you can't side with either. The film has scenes that will make you very uneasy. A masterpiece of film making that is bound to offend everyone who sees it and then make them think again about their views again.,1123545600,4,601,4.280701754385965
2350157,3,B000A1IOGG,"This movie wasn't good, nor was it bad. I actually had no idea how many stars to give it so I rated it somewhere in the middle. This movie is only watchable because I've never seen a movie like it. It wasn't exactly offensive or shocking to me, except the scenes where a grown man has sex with a child. What bothered me throughout the movie is how in the sex scenes, each girl is completely emotionless like nothing is even happening. Not a sound, not a movement, no facial expression....you can say ""blah blah shes desensitized to the situation and cold inside"", but come on, so unrealistic. And it was painful to watch a CLEARLY 30-something year old actress (the obese black one) try to act 12 years old. I enjoyed the scenes where the hitman kills that abortionist, it seemed really believable to me how freaked out he was....good acting in that scene. I REALLY disliked that little black girl in the beginning and ending of the film...yeah, shes cute, but can she talk anymore robotic? Like she is reading from cue cards, and why can't she keep her weird tongue in her mouth while she talks? It's creepy. This movie isn't very interesting or filled with much emotion, but I wanted to see what would happen next. I would recommend seeing it only because I'm sure you've never seen a movie like it.",1251417600,,1301,4.516949152542373
2350158,3,B000A1IOGG,"This was a hard movie for me to review. . .
I am a big fan of Todd Solondz and I am only giving this movie three stars instead of two because it is him.

Well, first off, I was under the impression that this was to be a take off of Welcome to the Dollhouse.  Other than mentioning some of the characters and some cameos (although, Mark has a fairly sizable role)there is not much resemblance.

I did watch the movie twice just to see if I was ""missing something"".  It was a little bit better the second time I watched it.  The first time it was really hard to wrap my mind around the concept of the character shifts.  Once I figured out thats what they were doing, I watched it again keeping that in mind and it was easier to follow.  I will not argue with the reviews that says it is ""powerful"".  It was a powerful piece that dealt with rough subject matter.  It had very good acting for the most part.  I did love Mama Sunshine and Dr. Dan (I think he is the jump to conclusions guy in office space)

I really like the non mainstream movies that make you think and I wanted to love this movie, but it just didn't do it for me.",1228694400,,1128,4.036036036036036
2350159,2,B000A1IOGG,"It might be beneficial to read the whole wiki plot summary before watching Palindromes for two reasons; some vital plot points which i have no idea how anyone even figured out and so you can not be distracted so much by the shock tactics which even involve the recent horror movie convention of the post-production enhanced impossibly loud bang to make you jump. If you've been wondering about the writer/director's intent with his previous films there's nothing here to clarify anything and a few of the expected ""oh my god why would you want to film that"" moments. It's still tempting to write it all off as shock value or nihilism but there's still an anthropological inquisitiveness fueling it however hard that may be to reconcile with how unexplored the characters motives remain in spite of their extreme actions. Maybe that's the intent, to have characters act extreme with little or no explanation and yet get a sympathetic response from an audience. The Dr Dan song was pretty awesome, like something out of Tim And Eric Awesome Show Great Job. I remain agnostic on the question of wtf is Todd Solondz's problem but as long as he keeps producing cultural artifacts like this one i'll keep asking.",1214438400,2,1206,4.830917874396135

He places American suburbia in the ugliest frame possible but manages to find some very dark humor within all the twisted sadness he portrays.  He takes people we normally don't want to know and examines them intimately enough that we must chose wether we like them or hate them more than we could ever imagine.  His latest film was 2004's Palindromes, and it is no exception to his style.  Solondz does more of the same but it almost seems that with Palindromes he wanted to explore his themes and style with even more depth.  Some viewers may think this means Palindromes is likely to be more disturbing, but really it is his style and his unrestrained creative madness that is more on display than the kind of content within his films that often justify his troubling reputation.  Although, like Happiness, Solondz explores child molestation and sexual deviance further than anyone, and many will not want to join him on this ride.

Aviva (played by 8 different actors, including Jennifer Jason Leigh) is a thirteen year old girl that is profoundly sad and who has only one motivation in her life.  She wishes to have a child so she may be loved by someone for the rest of her life.  She decides that in order to have a child she will have sex with an unsavory family friend named Judah.  Aviva's mother (Ellen Barkin) is devastated to find that Aviva is pregnant and orders her to get an abortion.  The doctor informs Aviva's parents that she is no longer capable of having children after the procedure, but her parents never actually inform Aviva of this complication.  She soon runs away from home to continue her quest to have a child.  She has sex with a pedofile truck driver who then abandons her.  Aviva's travels then bring her to a Christian fundamentalist group who cares for misfits kids without a home.  The head of this group is also involved in organizing the assassinations of doctors at abortion clinics, and one of his associates is the same pedofile truck driver who Aviva had relations with earlier in the film.  She is of course drawn to him again.  The truck driver, whose name is eventually revealed to be Bob, despite his constant need to use aliases and try to change what he is and what he is perceived as, is assigned to kill the doctor who completed Aviva's procedure.  Aviva goes with him and Bob accidently murders the doctor's young daughter in addition to killing the doctor.  He feels terrible for this and expresses how stupid it was for him to think that actions like that could change what he is.  By the film's end Aviva reunites with Judah, who now calls him self Otto. She has sex with him again, completely oblivious to the fact that she cannot have a child.

There are a few different reasons I think Solondz decided to use seven actresses and one young actor to portray Aviva.  For one, the obvious stand against convention is a Solondz trademark. The diversity of the group that plays Aviva is also wide and perhaps more provoking for that alone.  So each actor was probably cast without regard for visuals and more for their performance in their particular scenes.  The primary reason I think Solondz did this though was to show that no matter what you look like on the outside you can't change what you are. Aviva will always be Aviva no matter what she looks like on the surface.  Even if you spell her name backwards she will always be Aviva and Aviva will always want a child to call her mom.",1201651200,7,3848,4.937888198757764
2350163,4,B000A1IOGG,"This has got to be one of the most powerful, depressing films ever made. Todd Solondz has issues, but his films are always thought provoking, not to mention emotionally draining. This time around, he focuses on a thirteen year old girl named Aviva. Aviva's main goal in life is to become pregnant and be a mother, and so she sets off on a quest to make her dream a reality...with disastrous, often disturbing results. It should be noted that several different actors play the character of Aviva in each segment of the film. If it throws you off at first, stick with it. Not as complicated as you would think, and I thought it was a nice touch.

On her journey, she encounters many odd characters including a family of pro-life, extremist Christian zealots -- it's hard to tell whether this is just satire, or flat out mockery -- we don't all act like this, just so you know...Aviva also befriends a pedophile named Bob, who takes advantage of her early on in the film at a nasty hotel, and then abandons her. Extremely unsettling stuff, and Solondz never lets up either.

Aside from the sketchy subject matter, there are some beautiful moments in the film. One of my favorites was a segment entitled ""Huckleberry"". Simply amazing. The music in the film is also very, very nice. With that being said, I should mention that this is NOT for the average moviegoer. If your idea of a good movie is ""Roadhouse"", please do not watch this. There are several elements and subplots in this film that will unnerve, maybe even horrify some viewers in all of their raw power. However, if you are in the mood for a challenging film that will bring about strong emotions and give you some food for thought, by all means, see it. Just don't expect to be extremely happy once it's over. No, after this film, you're going to need to watch something lite...like ""Bambi"" lite...for there is no hope to be found in ""Palindromes"". In this world, your life is heading straight for disaster and there is nothing, absolutely nothing, that you can do about it.

One of the characters it's completely obvious that they are not a young teen. They look in their late thirties and has been smoking all her life. Overall I think this movie doesnt really have any point to it other than the world is perverted and that teenage girls are seriously demented sometimes.

2350165,4,B000A1IOGG,"Most parents cherish the idea of someday becoming grandparents.  But usually not when their daughter is only 13 years old!  Director Todd Solondz(Happiness, Welcome to the Dollhouse, Storytelling) once again grabs taboo around the neck and chokes out all our expectations.
This is a demented tale about the destruction of innocence.  A young girl named Aviva has one big dream--have a baby any way possible.  She falls just short of holding up a big sign on the corner saying ""PLEASE KNOCK ME UP!"".  Her parents understandably try to dissuade her efforts, so she runs away.  Needless to say her trip will evoke all kinds of reactions.

The character Aviva is played by seven or eight different girls, all of them unique--differing in age, size, and race.  This is an odd element to the story, since Aviva's appearance changes frequently.  This could have been done to illustrate different emotions or attitudes in the young girl.  But really I think it points out that the actual character doesn't really matter, it could be the story of any young girl.
Another interesting point the movie makes is the idea that people don't really ever change.  Despite your weight, age, financial status, plastic surgery, sex change, whatever...you are essentially the same person no matter what.  We are robots programmed arbitrarily by nature's genetic code.  I found that an interesting point, but hopefully there is no truth to that.

I strongly recommend that you check out any of Todd Solondz work.  This movie pretty much ends where Welcome to the Dollhouse leaves off, but is not important to watch it first.  All of Todd's films may seem brash and provocative, but underneath the surface they all harness an unbridled sense of compassion and sensitivity.

The film left me with the feeling that life isn't black and white or cut and dry. It made me question whether good and evil really exist, and whether the feeling of uniqueness that most of us seem to feel is valid.",1195171200,,372,4.485294117647059

People who liked the film have placed it in the context of the director's other work. There may be a place for it there, but for the 'newbie', it could use some keywords. Here are a few:

DRAMA, depictions of underage sex and sex between an adult and a minor; pornography; strong sexual thematic elements [such as pedophilia]; frank discussions about and depictions surrounding the topic of abortion; strong language.

2350168,4,B000A1IOGG,"Solondz is known for making tough and unpopular choices.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Happiness/dp/B00000IC7G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Happiness</a>&nbsp;and the first half of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Storytelling/dp/B00005JKJG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Storytelling</a>, specifically, are like mind-rapes, so soulfully brutal that it's easy to wonder if the guy isn't just shocking for shock's sake.

His films may be hard pills to swallow, but that doesn't make them any less medicinal.  His points, in fact, are surface-level, but their simplicity makes them easy to miss.  His scripts don't wink and smirk at the audience; they stare straight back at you with bloodshot and unblinking eyes.

""Palindromes"" has Solondz's bravado written all over it.  The story is about a girl named Aviva who, in spite of her emotionally flat-lined spirit, desperately wants to get pregnant.  She wants the unconditional love of another person, viewing a child like a sort of soul-transfusion.  Maybe the dependence and adoration of a baby will give life meaning, or comfort, or make her a person of worth.  In any case, it's clear that the ticks of her biological clock don't inform her decision: she's 13.

Her parents (Richard Masur and Ellen Barkin in complex, love-em-hate-em roles) are perturbed by her decision, and they do what they can to stop her, but, like many teenage girls, Aviva is a willful sort, and she ends up running away from home, setting off on a spiritual journey of self-discovery.  Yeah, that's right.  I just wrote ""a spiritual journey of self-discovery.""

In the course of her travels, Aviva meets pedophilic truck drivers, militant anti-abortionists, and a Christian singing group composed of handicapped and lethally cheerful children.  It's a tableau of Solondz's usual mordancy, off-putting quirkiness directed with a half-shrug of innocence.  In mid-journey, Aviva comes across a river, on the banks of which leans a fanciful children's boat, a large plastic toy that looks like it was designed by Playskool.  Dusk bleeds out over the horizon as she climbs aboard, expressionless, and drifts out over the unruffled currents.  It's a bittersweet symbol of poignance that pretends to be ironic.

In a way, that symbol represents everything about ""Palindromes"" that works (and the few things that don't).  Solondz's films usually operate like harsh mental exercises that force audiences to make tough decisions (like a mother being asked, ""If you only had enough time to save one of your children from a burning building, which one would it be?"").  This film is far less hands-on.  Aviva is portrayed by eight different actors and actresses, removing the physical element from the equation, forcing the audience to think less about Aviva and more about what she represents.  Even Aviva's personality is so muted, it's hard to imagine her as anything more than the yen of all people who feel like something is missing inside of them.

Still.  Even though the movie deals with child molestation, the horrors of both abortion and anti-abortionists, unconditional love versus radical spiritualism, ""Palindromes"" makes very few decisions, and Aviva never really changes much.  The title, the names of the key characters, the story arc, the movie's central point: it all reads the same backwards and forwards.  And though it's clever, it's also a little self-inflated.  Like a snake eating it's own tail, or a really, really intense Buddhist, this movie almost disappears straight into its own navel.

Although it delves into some fanciful mushiness, it's easy to respect its steadfast refusal to do anything else.  In any other case, the flick could be pigeonholed into a pro-life or pro-choice camp.  Like all of Solondz's other works, this movie doesn't operate under a banner you could wave with abandon on Pennsylvania Avenue.  I have the urge to give it a label (pro-people? anti-regret?), but its far too slippery for that, and that, in the end, makes it a movie worth watching.  In spite of a few pointless scenes (the party with Jennifer Jason Leigh, where Solondz almost tatoos his central thesis across the screen), ""Palindromes"" does quite well what it wants to.  It prompts consideration, debate, and buries (in even the serest of minds) the seeds of thought.  It may not be Solondz's most powerful film, but it is his most soulful.",1181433600,3,4455,5.438136826783115
2350169,3,B000A1IOGG,"The 13 years old Aviva Victor is a heroine of Todd Solondz's film ""Palindromes"". She is the only daughter of the loving parents but she is not happy and the only thing she passionately wants - to become a mother and to have a lot of babies. She gets pregnant at 13 and forced by her mother goes through an abortion. As the result of the procedure gone wrong, she will never be pregnant again. Aviva runs from home and enters the world populated by very strange, often dangerous but always multi-layered characters. What makes this movie rather unusual, Solondz chose eight different actresses (in age, color, and shape) to play Aviva. The writer/director explains the experiment by his desire to make as many women and girls as possible identify themselves with the girl in the search for love and understanding. Aviva is not a real girl, really, she is an archetype of a woman who longs for love and tenderness and who is absolutely innocent in her search for them, often in the wrong places with the wrong strangers.

As for the title, -- a palindrome is a word, phrase, verse, or sentence that reads the same backward or forward. In the way, it is a metaphor for life. The word dies just after been born when it reads letter by letter backwards. It is self destruction. The same applies to Aviva (her name is a palindrome, BTW) - she and the world around her are static, she is in the vicious circle and she can't break it. You can not move on if you just walk in circles. Even if it seems that the world around Aviva and she always change (that's why she's got so many different faces), she is still the same - no matter if she is a little girl, an awkward teenager, a heavy black woman or frightfully youthful Jennifer Jason Leigh.

Even though, I respect Solontz's decision to tell the parable rather than the story of one particular girl, I think that choosing eight actresses was one of the ""Palindromes'"" weaknesses. The idea was interesting but not all of the performers were up to the task and the constant switching of the actresses was rather distracting.

I admire Solondz for his fierce uncompromising bravery - he knows that his films will never be the crowd pleasers - but he keeps making them.. I am not sure if I like ""Palindromes"" but I keep thinking about it, and I know I would - for long time.",1175040000,3,2316,4.483412322274882
2350170,4,B000A1IOGG,"Solodnz breeches in Aviva the social and cultural expectations and burdens of young girls, showing that when Aviva embodies these expectations (albeit blindly) she's met with criticism and controlling adults with their own agendas.  The adults are all incredibly morally ambiguous, which very much plays into Aviva's lack of center or clue about the workings of the world.  Several different actresses play Aviva, their diverse appearances indicating her thoughts of herself, wishing she could be different, have a different life...  all tying back to the palindrome:  deconstruct a thing however you like, at core it doesn't change.  In a surreal way this tactic alone demonstrates a certain absolutism about the treatment of and perspective on 13 year old girls of any race, ethnicity or culture.  In the end Aviva withstands a wild experience, yet goes right back to her nature, the adults around her still oblivious.  The message is powerfully conveyed more visually rather than through dialogue.  To me though, more than illustrating a palindrome, it seemed that Aviva had no identity at all.

This film touches on virtually all levels of child exploitation, from the Britney self-possessed-teen-sexuality variety, the perspective of pedophiliac intrigue and impulse, the Jackson 5 stage parent variety, all of which are in their own way socially condoned. Certainly buttons are pushed by the situations in the film, indicating both sides of the abortion issue, what constitutes a pedophile, moreover, what constitutes a 13 year old girl.  Disturbingly achieved,  Solodnz makes it easy to see yourself in every character.  Again, showing these diverse views brings up sensitive boundaries and liberties, revealing the flaws and truths of moral relativism.

Quirky at best, though its message is powerful this film requires a lot of quick processing from its viewers to make sense.  I enjoyed Solodnz's film.  His commentary hits hard and without apology, which is most likely not going to appeal to most American palates.",1171497600,3,2026,5.347003154574132
2350171,2,B000A1IOGG,"You may need to double the strength of your Prozac prescription after watching ""Palindromes,"" Todd Solondz' relentlessly grim and depressing look into the dark underbelly of Middle America.  And if you happen to be looking for a movie that makes even a smidgen of sense, this largely incoherent and wholly pretentious ""art house"" offering may not be the work for you.  However, if you happen to enjoy solving a puzzle that comes with distressingly few clues to help you piece it all together, this just might be the movie you've been pining for.  Good luck.

The disjointedly episodic screenplay focuses on several seemingly unrelated teenage girls whose stories all involve pregnancy and/or abortion in one form or another.  Or are they really all the same girl in different guises, since they each share the palindromic name Aviva and keep taking one another`s places at key moments throughout the movie?  And if all this sounds more than slightly incomprehensible, welcome to the inscrutable world that is  ""Palindromes.""  All three girls are equally inarticulate and cloddish and suffer from aggravated cases of poor self-image, so I suppose they COULD all be the same person, though, in all honesty, I haven't the foggiest notion who anybody in this movie was supposed to be or how they happened to be related to one another.  Eventually, I just threw up my hands in stupefied resignation and - not being the world's greatest gamesman to begin with - gave up trying to figure any of it out at all.

In an effort to paint American society in the worst light possible, Solondz has populated his film with endless caricatures of religious right extremists and in-bred country bumpkins.

Solondz, who made a far more compelling and coherent movie named ""Storytelling"" a few years back, at least earns kudos for casting relatively ""unattractive"" actors in the key roles, thereby vaccinating his film against the Beautiful People virus that afflicts even the most ""independent ""of independent features these days.  But with ""Palindromes,"" the director may have erred too much in the other direction, producing a film that sees nothing but the bad side of life and expecting us to wallow in all the ugliness right along with him.

Watching ""Palindromes"" is like throwing the pieces from three separate jigsaw puzzles into a giant pile, then attempting to put them together from the jumble that's been created.  It might ultimately be possible, but it really doesn't seem like the most productive or entertaining way to go about doing it.",1165881600,3,2535,5.01909307875895

I love Solondz's films because at the end I'm always troubled, thinking, and reevaluating my perceptions of the world. Solondz is a genius at turning themes and ideas in on themselves again and again. Pro-Lifers are overzelous; however, they step up to the plate when it comes to helping children no one else would. The Pro-Choice parents want the best for their daughter's future, but overlook her desires and hinder her future by forcing her into a decision. As mentioned in another review, one of the main points in Palindromes is that we end where we begin. The monologue about this point is ingenious and very convincing in the film. Solondz pokes fun at himself by having this monologue delivered by a character from one of his first films, and the discussion of ""Dawn"" from Welcome to the Dollhouse. Solondz acknowledges that even he is a self contained human being who has not changed from Welcome to the Dollhouse to Palindromes. If you are the type of person who has to be entertained by dancing bears throughout the movie, then this is not the film for you.

Storytelling was overwrought with boundary pushing, and Palindromes ambled along in one too many directions. I appreciate ambiguity, although I wonder if Dawn's death was just a tool to keep Welcome To The Dollhouse fans interested.

Happiness was squirm worthy, & smart, not just shocking for the sake of it. I will admit though, when I read the screenplay, as opposed to watching the film, I wanted to take a shower.  Dirty! Dirty!

I also thought that there was some interesting statements made in the movie like portraying the steriotyped nutty religious family as also a haven for the dispossessed, and putting the girl in the middle of the cultural tug of war for and against abortion, portraying both sides as cruel and shallow.",1141257600,3,721,4.82258064516129
2350180,5,B000A1IOGG,"I cannot get enough of Todd Solondz, he is one of the most daring and provocative of the new wave of hipster filmmakers (Sofia Coppola, Wes Anderson etc.).  Again like his other works Palindromes is a tale of suburban angst, in fact this takes place in the same universe as Welcome to the Dollhouse as evidenced by the mention of Dawn Weiner and the appearance of her brother Mark Weiner.

This film is a little girl's odyssey of sorts both physical, and emotional, a young misguided girl who doesn't seem to love herself all that much and wants to have a baby.  That is me making this all simplified so as not to give to much away.

If you are turned off by Happiness and maybe even offended or disturbed by Storytelling, this one should be a little bit easier to handle, however it does deal with issues of abortion, child abuse, and religious fanatics.  All of these things are done well however.

This film has strong artistic merits as well, continuing the creative trend which I feel started with Storytelling.  In this case we have seven different people play the lead character of Aviva.  She is played by people of all ages, size, race, and even a boy at one point.

If you do not like to think during your film viewing or be left wanting to have a discussion I suggest you pass on this one.

Palindromes is one of the most underrated and slept on films of 2005, and regardless of all of that one of the best hands down.

Simply a series of haphazard events which were strewn together, with the central role played by as many actors as they are different, Palindromes ultimately lacks direction or meaning.

Palindromes marks a noticeable departure in Solondz's vitriolic hate as he begins to enter the realm of the political, taking on the issue of abortion. He devotes approximately 1/3 of the film to discrediting extreme and irresponsible pro-choice people, which he demonstrates by including a monologue from a suburban mother who explains to her daughter the value of aborting a child when it has become an inconvenience. Another third is devoted to demonstrating the absurdity of the extreme Christian pro-life individuals (whom Solondz clearly despises even more), as he reveals a house run by Christian fanatics as they take in abandoned children and feed them with violent anti-abortion polemics. Clearly Solondz has many problems with organized religion, and many problems with suburban American life; however, he also seems to have a problem with humanity. He is unable to see anything redeeming in the human race, and all his characters exhibit weakness, evil, disability, stupidity, and deep-seeded depravity. This is a cruel and narrow vision of humanity and Solondz knows it, his films are simply a gathering of scenarios which are intended to shock and horrify, nothing more.

2350185,4,B000A1IOGG,"""Palindromes"" is writer/director Todd Solondz's latest audacious, satirical journey into bourgeois America. The narratives are becoming more far-fetched and contrived, but somehow without losing their black humor, recognizable characterizations, and watchability. ""Palindromes"" returns to familiar territory. It's main character, Aviva Victor, is the cousin of ""Welcome to the Doll House""'s ultimate middle child Dawn Wiener. Actor Matthew Faber reprises his role as Dawn's brother Mark. Aviva is 13 years old and desperately wants to have a baby. But her blunt, tenacious mother (Ellen Barkin) stands in her way. So Aviva runs away from home where she hopes to get pregnant and have a child undeterred. Instead, she encounters a strange bunch of ideologues whom she could easily have reason to hate or to embrace, as they could her.

There are 2 major themes at work in ""Palindromes"". One is an exercise in manipulating audience sympathies. Aviva is played by 8 different actors, including a large black woman and a pubescent boy, in order to draw attention to the role that appearances (age, race, sex) play in audience reaction. Oddly, the changes in Aviva's appearance don't derail the narrative. I quickly got used to it and came to identify Aviva with her mousy, barely audible voice instead of with a particular appearance. The only viva  incarnation that I didn't buy into is the 6-year-old girl, and that was because her manner of speaking was different. I'm not sure what this says about how an audience identifies with a character. Aviva's various appearances were not chosen randomly. They make a certain amount of sense. But it amazes me that Todd Solondz gets away with this kind of in-your-face manipulation without coming off as intolerably self-indulgent. Chalk it up to good writing, I guess.

Aviva's name is a palindrome, like the title says. I assume this alludes to the film's second theme, which is people's inability to change. People are what they are, no matter how you look at them. And they have a certain worldview, no matter how they look at it. ""Palindromes"" presents Aviva's mother Joyce in fairly harsh light, but Ellen Barkin's funny, earnest, domineering delivery is the film's stand-out performance. Joyce is caring and generous toward her child, but not as ""liberal"" as she would like to think. She probably does the right thing for the wrong reason. She's selfish. And her concept of family clashes with her daughter's equally selfish concept of family. Jennifer Jason Leigh embodies Aviva at one point, and her middle-aged face and girlish physique fit the bill perfectly.

Woody Allen tackled the question Is Life a Comedy or a Tragedy? in ""Melinda and Melinda"" earlier this year. It was an interesting question but a dull film. ""Palindromes"" is a better exploration of that idea. Some will find Aviva's experiences horrific; others will find the whole thing absurdly hilarious. It's probably good that it's never clear how seriously Todd Solondz wants us to take his films. But for Solondz fans, ""Palindromes"" is another provocative, darkly funny look at families though the experiences of a young protagonist. Just as a note: there is some confusion over Aviva's age. The film's web site says she is 12 years old, apparently in error. She is referred to as being 13 in the film, the press kit, and in statements by the director.

2350186,5,B000A1IOGG,"Once again Tod Solondz brings us a film that shakes us out of our liberal moral complacencies, providing an experience that is disturbing and yet touching, and in this case deeply philosophical. On the surface an examination of the abortion debate, in fact Solondz uses the fanatically held yet muddled convictions of proponents on both sides as a means to explore deeper questions of who we are and how we can find meaning in life.

Both liberal pro-choicers and Christian pro-lifers share the conviction that human individuals have the power to choose who to be and how to act.
For the Christian, individuals have the power to choose between good and evil. God has granted us the power to define our very souls and to be granted everlasting heaven or hell. Homosexuals can be 'saved'. Even paedophiles like the character Earl can be born again.
For the liberal on the other hand, the only thing constraining choice is that of unfavourable power relationships. Society may determine the choices that women want to make i.e. wishing to have children, or deny them the choice at all.

Solondz presents the journey of Aviva as a darkly grim fairytale that reveals a different kind of truth about human nature. People don't change. They might get a facelift, lose weight, spend dollars on breast enlargement, in other words change their appearance and gain acceptance in society, but they always stay the same. The need to believe in free will, the ability to change and to control your destiny is fundamental to almost all creeds and dogmas and indeed across the American political spectrum. It is essential to our notions of morality, to praise and blame, reward and punishment, to who we are and to what we may become.

But there is no free will. In the end we finish up the same people we were at the beginning. Despite her many weird experiences, at the end of her journey Aviva is a lot older and wiser, but still the same child she was at the beginning, still needing love and acceptance and still needing to fulfil those needs through having children.

In the end we are the same collection of cells, the same genetic blueprint for life and potential that we were as a fetes, a fetes that Avivas mother describes as 'just a tumour'. The same human fetus that is somehow imagined by Christians to be a unique human soul (even those that 'lack fingers and toes, brains and hearts') and yet has its uniqueness defined by a power of choice it does not yet have, if it ever will.

The acting is superb throughout, with all the actresses playing Aviva performing admirably and a couple excelling.

The DVD lacks extras, but is certainly worth purchasing as it is a film that deserves many viewings and that repays careful study. It does come with a detailed and informative interview with Director/Writer Tod Solondz.",1130803200,4,2816,4.736734693877551

It is a little bit stark, depressing philosophically, but it raises good questions about morality and Christianity and how our extreme religious positions can cause us to do terrible things to one another.  I ended up getting the DVD because I needed to watch it again a few times.  I turn back to it every few years.",1522627200,,458,4.416666666666667

8072295,5,B000A1IOGG,"What a long strange trip This movie is the follow-up to Welcome to the Dollhouse which I really liked. Dawn Weiner she never could win in life or death. The movie picks up at Dawns funeral and although she is talked about throughout Heather Matarazzo does not appear in this movie and that is a shame, but I digress. This film is set on a character whose name is s palindrome and that is Aviva. She is the daughter of Ellen Barkin and Richard Masur . Without blowing the whole storyline Aviva is a troubled girl with a troubled life and it only gets worse as the story progresses. The movie does not have a happy ending much like its predecessor, is the film worth watching? Yes it is. If you haven't watched the first movie you might not get the all the Dawn references, but you muddle through If you are watching for Jennifer Jason Leigh her screen time is minimal and disappointing.",1431734400,,885,4.402439024390244

1) the lead actress ALWAYS changes.

2) it has MURDER in it.

3) it uses the word PALINDROMES.",1397174400,,142,4.384615384615385
8072298,5,B000A1IOGG,"A very precise, bold and engaging film, I must say. I didn't have any major expectations from the film, but oh wow! the film did move me. What an overwhelming experience it was. Witnessing some genuine situations of genuine people around. Pedophilia is not just the subject highlightened here, its mostly about humanity, self honesty, friendship and much more. The film is full of surprises, it has a lot to offer to the viewer. Witness some real amazing adventures here and much more.",1267228800,,485,4.855421686746988
8072299,1,B000A1IOGG,"It seems that regardless of what people feel about this film, there is never a complete positive acknowledgement of it being great. Although most people seem to want to point out the genious of many of the people involved with and/or in this film, I think that a few morsels of interest doesn't qualify this flick for genious status.

Personally, I dislike feeling as though I am in the middle of a Christian Cult Gathering or finding myself witnessing a political debate over the pros and cons of abortion.

I'm afraid that I am not part of the Director's Fan Club.  I think he is stringing together a variety of related (or non-related) events, deliberatly meant to make the viewer somewhat confused, in order to disguise bad work and make viewers praise the work, rather than say it was boring, beating a dead horse and just plain awful.

In many of the reviews, the submitters have suggested ""thinking about the film.""  I am going to spend my energy trying to forget it.",1261094400,2,974,4.6395348837209305
8072300,4,B000A1IOGG,"Well...I liked it. You won't see Spielberg or any of the other ""great"" filmmakers take on such a difficult subject without making it a maudlin melodrama. Very good script writing and directing (after all most of these people in the film are not polished professional actors). This movie will make you have a talk with your kids, at least it should. But what I enjoyed mostly about the film is that is amoral. All the players are realistically represented. Watch for yourself if you like movies that don't hold your hand as you watch it.",1252972800,,536,4.652631578947369
