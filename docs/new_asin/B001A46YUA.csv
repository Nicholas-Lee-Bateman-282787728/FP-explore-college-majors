8275994,3,B001A46YUA,I would of liked to give this sequel 5 stars but I feel like waiting soooo long after making the 1st one to make the 2nd one really hurt the series/movie or what it could of been. Part of what made the 1st one so good was the cast. Granted we get I believe the same old stamp collector guy and as an extra one the original actors but all grown up but that just isn't the same. The boy they got to play Tommy Tricker wasn't bad in this sequel and maybe had this been the 1st movie not the 2nd maybe could of liked it more Idk. It just didn't have the magic the first one had. Its still a nice kids movie and I did enjoy it and the updated version of the Rufus Wainwright song but ya I just couldn't give this movie more than 3-3.5 stars.,1373760000,,736,3.880794701986755
8275995,1,B001A46YUA,"CAN SEE THAT THE WRITERS OF THIS MOVIE, DID WISH TO TAKE OFF WHERE THE ORIGINAL MOVIE STOPPED, BUT FOR SOME REASON I DID NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE AS I DID THE ORIGINAL. MAY HAVE BEEN THE ACTOR OR THE OTHER ACTORS/ACTRESSES IN THE MOVIE, BUT MY SINCERE GUESS IS THAT THE WRITER JUST DID NOT CATCH MY ATTENTION THE WAY THE FIRST MOVIE DID.  MY SUGGESTION, DONT EVEN BOTHER BUYING THIS MOVIE, NO MATTER WHAT THE PRICE.",1338163200,,410,4.256410256410256
