8244339,4,B00127BYOG,"I owned the ""P-40"" and ""P-51"" Roaring Glory videos on VHS years ago, and they were a significant part of my decision to become a professional pilot.  Now, twenty years later, it is wonderful to be able to own these stirring, beautiful programs on DVD.

The ""P-40 Warhawk"" disk may very well be the single finest program about an airplane ever created.  You can just feel Jeff Ethell's boylike thrill at being able to fly the National Warbird Museum's P-40 off of the grass strip in Geneseo, New York on a fine summer day.  He roars down the runway, climbs out in a storm of Allison V-12 engine noise, and plays with puffy white clouds at 300 mph while doing rolls and steep turns.  All the while, his narration brings you right into the cockpit with him, and by the time you're done, you really do feel like you've gone along for a ride in an airplane that all real pilots would give anything to fly, and that only a lucky, elect few ever will.

The ""P-51"" is equally good, including a loop this time and some fantastic in-cockpit footage.  The ""P-47"" video is a bit more sedate; possibly the owner didn't want the airplane wrung out too much, and who could blame him?  At this point, every single one of these machines is the ultimate odds-cheater.  Not only did today's flying warbirds managed to escape the breaker and the scrap pile at the end of WWII, but they've found owners that have both the passion and the very, very deep pockets necessary to keep them in the air.

Jeff Ethell's passion at bringing them to us (in all their Roaring Glory) is what makes the first four programs in this collection worth their weight in gold.  They are glimpses into a time in aviation history when leather jackets and fur-lined flying helmets combined with near transonic speeds (in dives) and with an era of machine-gun-based dogfighting that was as short-lived as it was terrifying and exhilarating.

And unfortunately, as most of us who love warbirds know, Jeff Ethell didn't cheat the odds long enough to complete this series.  Shortly after filming the ""P-38 Lightning"" disk, he ran his engines out of fuel in that airplane and crashed while trying to get it to a runway, tragically dying in sight of his veteran fighter pilot father, whose grief and anguish can't possibly be imagined, only regretted.

Famous air racer Steve Hinton picks up Ethell's fallen banner and carries it forward, bringing us a disk on the Corsair, Hellcat and a number of other airplanes; but there was only one Jeff Ethell and Hinton comes across as if he's doing us a favor, or maybe just fulfilling a contract.  He may love warbirds, but his narration style is as deadpan and detached as Ethell's was passionate and engaging.  It wasn't Hinton's fault.  He was in the position of a man being asked to pick up Glenn Miller's baton and somehow carry on.

I don't know if that P-40 is still based out there at the National Warbird Museum in Geneseo, New York; or if that museum or that airplane even exist anymore.  Museums have a way of closing, and old airplanes have a way of crashing.  But as long as I live, there will be a young man inside of me, standing in awe in the summer heat next to those cornfields, watching wide-eyed through my Ray Ban Aviators as Jeff Ethell roars overhead with those white shark teeth flashing in the sun, with that V-12 Allison roaring and singing.  He didn't just fly an airplane for us, he flew our souls to a place that no aviation film had ever taken us before; and for the gift that he gave to my soul, I will be eternally grateful.",1285286400,10,3549,4.531347962382445
