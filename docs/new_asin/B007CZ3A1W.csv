This was the UFCs first time back in Japan since UFC 29 in 2000 so this was a big deal. There were so many fights I was looking forward to on this card. There were a lot of guys on this card that I am a huge fan of so this was a big event for me. I was looking forward to seeing Edgar lose the Lightweight title to Ben Henderson, but there was a guy I loved in every fight so this was going to be great.

Spoilers

1. ANTHONY PETTIS VS JOE LAUZON-I was looking forward to this fight because I knew both of these guys come to fight. Joe is one of the most skilled guys out there and Pettis is a killer. It turns out I was right as both guys go straight into it and it does not last a round. After trading for most of the time Pettis lands a huge kick to Joes head and drops him. He finishes it with punches and gets the win that set him on his path to the Lightweight title.

2. HATSU HIOKI VS BART PALASZEWSKI-the first round here is dominated by Hioki as he dropped Bart early and then got him to the ground. He spends the rest of the round on top and goes for some close submissions. The second round was all on the feet with both guys landing every now and then. The final round looked much like the first with Hioki getting the fight to the ground and dominating. Towards the end he gets Barts back but is unable to finish, he wins by UD.

3. TIM BOETSCH VS YUSHIN OKAMI-this was another fight I was looking forward to since I am a huge fan of Okami. I wanted him to beat Anderson Silva in his fight before this but he fell short on that one. This was the rebound fight and Okami took the first round with the crisper strikes. Boetsch does hold his own and land some good shots as well though. The next round was another one for Thunder as he landed the cleaner strikes. There was one point in which Boetsch tried to sink in a guillotine choke but Okami fought out of it and dominated on top. He landed big shots and threatened with a kimura. Going into the third Boetsch knew he was down two rounds and had to go for broke, and that is exactly what he did. He came out throwing some big shots with hooks and head kicks, but once on the cage he lands some HUGE uppercuts that end the fight. Watching it live I was very upset but Boetsch is a cool dude, great fight.

4. JAKE SHIELDS VS YOSHIHIRO AKIYAMA-I am a huge fan of both of these guys so this one was going to hurt me regardless. My girl on the other hand although she is a fan of Akiyama she LOVES Jake Shields. Shields is a top level Jiu-Jitsu guy and Akiyama is an elite Judo guy so this fight was going to be good. This was Akiyamas Welterweight debut and he looked excellent. The first round was great as both guys landed and Akiyama got off some great trips. The second round was another great one with Shields and Akiyama traded shots throughout the round. Akiyama landed a huge throw towards the end making that the biggest moment of the round. The final round is another good one with Shields finally getting that takedown. He would end the round on Akiyamas back and ends up getting the UD.

5. MARK HUNT VS CHEICK KONGO-my brothers main guy Mark Hunt was going against big Kongo here. I am also a huge fan of Hunt so I was excited about this one. This fight showcases how great of a kick boxer that Hunt is, he is a K-1 champion. His strikes are so pin point it is amazing, there is a left that is so well timed and drops Kongo. It is shortly thereafter that Hunt lands some BIG rights that put Cheick out, we loved it.

6. QUINTON JACKSON VS RYAN BADER-the story going into this fight was that Rampage missed weight and this was one of the last fights on his contract with the UFC. Rampage came out to the Pride theme that this crowd remember him for from those days. With that we all thought for sure this fight was going to be fireworks. But the first round was mostly a feeling out thing and battles for position. The second round has one of the scariest looking moments ever. Jackson goes vintage Rampage and SLAMS Bader and Ryan lands so awkward on his neck and arm, looking like both might have been broken. But Bader fights back and ends up getting the takedown and controlling the rest of the round. The final round is mostly Bader as he gets the takedown and stays on top. Bader gets the UD here in a fight that upset us all since Quinton lost.

7. BEN ENDERSON VS FRANKIE EDGAR-this was the fight for the Lightweight title and based on these guys styles we knew it would be a good one. Of course all of us were behind our boy from the WEC Benson Henderson. The first round is great with both guys constantly moving and striking. Edgar does well catching Hendersons kicks which leads to a cool looking moment. This was a close round but Edgar got a few takedowns. The second round keeps the fast pace with Edgar ending up on top on Ben. The big moment of the round is when Edgar stands Ben lands a nasty up kick to end the round that bloodies Edgar. The third round sees both guys going at it fast again and constantly moving. It would be Henderson that gets the first takedown this time but Edgar answers with one of his own at the end. We follow that with another fast pace go round with Ben almost sinking in a guillotine choke here. Edgar battles out of it and the round ends close again. The final round is just as close with both guys keeping that crazy pace. Ben gets dropped here but comes back at the end to almost finish Frankie, in the end my pick became the new champ. Ben Henderson gets the belt and defeats Edgar for the first of two times.

DISC 2

1. TIEQUAN ZHANG VS ISSEI TAMURA-this opening fight of the night was a great one especially for Tamura. He controlled the first round with relative ease as he landed some big shots and also controlled from the top when it went to the ground. The second round lasts only 32 seconds as Tamura blasts Zhang with a right that knocks him out cold.

2. TAKEYA MIZUGAKI VS CHRIS CARIASO-one of the fights I was looking forward to since I am a big fan of Mizugaki. The opening round was a great one with both guys looking good but I think Mizugaki took the round getting the takedown and controlling a bit more. The second round sees both men come out hard but it is Mizugaki who gets the takedown again and keeps it there until Chris is able to reverse it but Mizugaki gets right back up after spinning out. The third round was a completive one with Chris looking a little better here but Mizugaki still ends up on top. This one ends with Chris getting the decision although I still feel Mizugaki won this.

3. RIKI FUKUDA VS STEVE CANTWELL-we get a great first round with both men landing some great shots and Fukuda getting a takedown and letting loose some ground and pound.  We follow that up with a great second round with Fukuda getting put in a guillotine as he went for the takedown. Once on the feet they both land some good shots but Cantwell takes the harder ones there. He ends the round on Fukudas back. The final round was mostly Fukuda as he let loose some bombs on Cantwell. He hit him with some sick body kicks, he takes the UD.

4. NORIFUMI YAMAMOTO VS VAUGHAN LEE-Kid Yamamoto is a heavy hitter and was expected to take this fight in spectacular fashion. It turns out that no one told that to his opponent and this turned into one of the best fights on the card. The legend in Kid came to fight and rocked his opponent but that was given back to him as Lee nailed him right back. This led to Kid taking him down only to get trapped in an armbar after Lee transitioned to that from a triangle. This was an excellent fight although it lasted only one round.

5. TAKANORI GOMI VS EIJI MITSUOKA-Gomi is absolutely one of my all time favorite fighters so you know who I was behind here. This like the last was a great fight and very competitive as it was back and forth. Mitsuoka who is also a great fighter started to land more as it went on and even had a mounted triangle from the back on Gomi to end the round. The second round is all Gomi as he rushes in and just starts swinging and landing knees. He ends up getting the TKO victory after finishing the very tough Mitsuoka on the ground.

This was a great event full of some great fights and it was cool to see the UFC back in Japan. With this DVD you get behind the scenes, weigh-ins and of course the Countdown show. This is an excellent DVD and worth the purchase.",1384732800,3,8385,4.178836633663367

8514832,1,B007CZ3A1W,"I have been hired to condemn the distribution of yet another watered-down UFC Dvd.

Apparently, this is the only job for which I am suited.

...I am beset by the ironies of my life.

The Pride events in Japan were a rare thing. You could spend your life looking for one, and it would not be a wasted life. Instead of honoring the rich history of the glorious Pride Fighting Championship by putting together real fights between real fighters willing to throw down and give the fans what they paid for, we were subjected to yet another example of why the UFC is dying a slow, wrestler-heavy, point-fighting infected death.

Where was the pageantry?

Where was the showmanship?

Where was the PASSION?

They say Pride was made by a sword. They say the MMA gods dipped a coral blade into the ocean, and when they pulled it out four perfect drops fell back into the sea, and those drops became the legendary events of Pride. I say, Pride was made by a handful of brave men. Warriors, willing to give their lives for what seems to have become a forgotten word: honor.

Pride fighters were an intriguing people. From the moment they woke they devoted themselves to the perfection of the art of real fighting. I have never seen such discipline. I am surprised to learn that the word Ray Jackson means, ""to troll"", and that Mr. Jackson believes his rebellion to be in the service of mixed martial arts.

There was once a battle at a place called Trollmopylae, where three hundred brave Pride nuthuggers held off a Zuffa army of a million shills. They're overconfident, we can use that. We take away the advantage of their Affliction t-shirts and their Ariel Helwanis and we can lure them in close...close enough for a troll.

Someone once asked me if I believe a man can change his destiny.

I believe a man does what he can.

...until his destiny is revealed.",1334102400,2,1851,4.5589123867069485
8514833,5,B007CZ3A1W,"The UFC hasn't been to Japan since UFC 29 back in December of 2000.  Not only was the card stacked with a lot of native fighters (natural for oversea events) but it came with some of the most intriguing fights of any event thus far this year.  Also, the main event card came with a whopping seven fights.

To start things off Anthony Pettis and Joe Lauzon look to take one more step up in the rankings of the lightweight division by taking each other out.  December of 2010 Pettis made waves in the MMA world with a kick heard round the world, which solidified his victory in becoming the last WEC lightweight champion.  Initially looking to challenge for the UFC lightweight title right away his shot was pushed back by the scheduled rematch of Edgar/Maynard III after last year's post New Year's epic of Edgar/Maynard II.  Instead he fought Clay Guida in losing effort during a contender eliminator bout.  Since then he beat Jeremy Stephens by way of split decision so in order to keep his title dreams alive he would have to destroy Lauzon in devastating fashion, which many have tried and failed.  Most recently Lauzon defeated Melvin Guillard, another brutally powerful striker, who had looked to knockout Lauzon but instead was chocked out by the underdog.  Lauzon looked to repeat his performance by finishing Pettis in his bout.  Little under a minute and a half in the opening round we would given out answer of who would walk away on step closer to a title shot with a quick and pronounced finish.

Bart Palaszewski left an impression in his debut match in the UFC by soundly finishing Tyson Griffin.  Next up on the chopping block was home country favorite Hatsu Hioki.  Hioki was touted as the inevitable challenger to Jose Aldo's crown but looked very unimpressive in his split decision victory over George Roop in his debut match.  Looking to shuffle off the rumors Hioki came into this match looking to put Palaszewski away in convincing fashion.  As it went the fight was pretty one-sided with one fighter able to implement his game plan in dominating fashion.  Although not the strongest outing it definitely showed that one fighter was working his way towards a title shot by putting away a tough opponent.

In his last fight Yushin Okami was unable to dethrone long time middleweight king, Anderson Silva.  Looking to get back on the winning track the ""dark horse"" of the middleweight division would have to put away Tim Boetsch.  Since moving to the middleweight division Boetsch has had two successful victories and looked to ring out a third one by defeating the latest victim of the Spider.  For two rounds one fighter puts on an absolute clinic on the other; beating him up, mounting him, and what at times looked like a fight that would end any second before going into the third.  Then, in the third round, the best comeback of the year thus far occurs with a devastating flurry of uppercuts to end one fighter's dreams of victory.

Both Jake Shields and Yoshihiro Akiyama are coming off of respective losses.  Shields in his fight prior was blitzed by Jake Shields in only 53 seconds of the opening round following his loss to current champion GSP.  Akiyama had suffered three losses in a row at middleweight and is attempting to try his luck at welterweight.  With a lot to loss this was a crucial fight in the careers of both fighters.  While it's not the most exciting fight of the night it was an interesting game to see whose strength would play out more, the Jiu-Jitsu of Shields or Judo and power of Akiyama.  In a fight that goes to the judges it leaves a lot of lingering questions for the loser while not showcasing the victor too well.

At heavyweight it's given that just about anyone can knockout their opponent.  Lightweights are known for their non-stop cardio and energy and on the other end you've got the heavyweights with their absolutely destructive power.  Mark Hunt has recently come off of his victory over Ben Rothwell which was a hard hitting fight and looked to finish off his next opponent in Cheick Kongo.  Kongo has always been a dangerous striker, having only been stopped by some of the best of the division.  These two started off decently enough, not pressing the action too hard but before long one of these heavyweights got caught by one big shot which eventually led to flurry of heavy handed shots in first half of the opening round.

Quinton Rampage Jackson had been pushing a long time for an event in Japan.  If it happened he was gonna do everything within his power to be on that card, since his last time in front of a Japanese crowd was during his days in PRIDE back in 2006.  Being the country in which he made a name for himself Jackson was looking to give a spectacular showing against Ryan Bader.  Bader entered the UFC as an Ultimate Fighter winner and was undefeated until he ran into a roadblock known has Jon Jones.  He then suffered another loss against Tito Ortiz before getting back in the win column with a knockout of  Jason Brilz last November.  A victory would go a long way for both fighters, either personal gain or professional.  A goose-bump worthy moment of mention before the fight is Jackon's entrance into the arena.  For those who might not know he chose the PRIDE theme to enter and the crowd went nuts.  The fight itself was a bit different than what you might expect from two heavy hitters.  While big shots were thrown a majority of the fight revolved around control along the fence and the ground.  It eventually boiled down to the takedowns the victor was able to get and control he was able to exhibit.

Frankie Edgar came out of 2011 with two of the best fights of the year, with the second solidifying his place as champion by finally putting away Gray Maynard.  Unfortunately for him the lightweight division is a shark tank full of dangerous contenders around every corner.  That's where Ben Henderson comes in.  Coming off his victory over Clay Guida (in what was one of the best matches of the year) he gained number one contendership for Edgar's title.  Having soundly beaten Jim Miller and Mark Bocek as well Henderson was riding a lot of momentum coming into the fight.  Not sure what it is but put Edgar into a title fight (with the exception of the BJ Penn fights) fans are treated to fireworks, and that's only boosted by the fact that Henderson's style of fighting puts on fight of the year candidates as well (let's not forget about his fight of the year against Donald Cerrone in 2009).  Simply put, the champion fight was everything this event needed to cap off an already successful event, with what was one of the best fights of the years.  Like Machida/Shogun I, Edgar/Maynard II, and Condit/Diaz this fight is a close one.  Watch it with close friends, casual fans, or just about anyone who's willing to follow along and score the fight.  I've gotten different views from my friends, although a majority of us agreed about the victor.  Definitely not a fight to be missed.

Overall, the UFC made an extremely successful return to Japan.  While the atmosphere of the night was a bit different than the usual American crowd, more quiet than the typical rowdy booing that comes associated with lulls in action, the Japanese crowd was extremely respectful and gave great energy.  It comes highly recommended that you should view this event as it stands to be the best event so far this year.",1331596800,9,7409,4.651037663335895
