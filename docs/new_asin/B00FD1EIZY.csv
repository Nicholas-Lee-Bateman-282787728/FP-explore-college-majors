8614470,4,B00FD1EIZY,"The episode Jonah starts when Joy gets to witness her classmate Sharon Myers steals a bike. She reports to the school principal what happens. But she becomes surprised when Principal Travis takes the incident lightly and does not intend to punish Myers. After Joy's discussion with the principal,she together with Chris and Gizmo are taken back in time by Superbook in the ship where Jonah is located.

The trio - Chris,Joy and Gizmo - meet with the prophet Jonah,who is running away from God. The prophet blames himself for the storm in the middle of the sea that the ship is currently experiencing. When the other passengers learn about it,they throw the trio and Jonah into the sea and all end up in the big fish's belly.

After staying inside for three days,Jonah and the trio were thrown by the fish on Nineveh. Upon reaching the major city,Jonah calls upon them to repent from their evil ways. He warns them that God is prepared to destroy the place after 40 days if they continue on their evil ways. When the king heard of this news,he ordered his people to turn from their evil ways. The people in Nineveh followed the king promptly and decided to renew themselves by turning away from their sins. After they have become better people,they escaped God's wrath and the city was not destroyed.

When Chris,Joy and Gizmo went back to the present time,they learned valuable lessons about love,mercy and forgiveness. Joy met with Sharon Myers and Principal Travis at the conclusion with Myers returning the bike that she stole in the morning and the principal not punishing her for it.

It was a nice episode about Jonah. Too bad that humor was somehow missing unlike in the classic series. It would have been a better one if there were some comedic moments especially if applied on Jonah's character. Also,I felt that the lesson of change was somewhat overlooked. It would also have been better if Sharon Myers realized that stealing is a bad action and promising the Principal Travis to reform her ways instead of just returning the bike that she stole would have made a better impact since reformation is what the people of Nineveh did upon hearing Jonah.",1444608000,2,2161,4.754666666666667
