7987696,2,B00008WJDT,"I don't mean to bum anyone out right at the beginning of a review, but this is a pretty sucky movie. Sucky on the point of being dreadful. Produced during that period in the early 2000s when the Nu Image studio couldn't make a good movie for neither love nor money, its an annoying exercise in mundanity. Nearing the end of his career as an action hero, lead star Bryan Genesse does what little he can to make this one stand out but only manages to save it from a rock-bottom rating.

The story: When a gang of arrested thieves (led by Bentley Mitchum,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ruby-in-Paradise/dp/B000AMCBI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ruby in Paradise</a>) takes over the train transporting them to prison and makes hostages of the passengers, its up to their captor (Genesse,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Street-Justice/dp/B000JCE3N4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Street Justice</a>) to end the crisis.

The film was probably made under very limited means, as evidenced by the frequent use of stock footage. The exterior shots of the train are taken from a movie shot in British Columbia, and seeing the filmmakers try to pass off this landscape as the Mexican countryside is kinda goofy. So is the casting: like many Nu Image flicks, this ones supporting roles are predominantly played by Bulgarian performers, and if you think its been interesting listening to East Europeans fake English dialogue, just wait til you hear em speaking Spanish. Before long, it seems too much to take for even the producers, who end up dubbing most of the Spanish. Disappointingly, they did not dub Bentley Mitchums lines. Mitchum is a fair character actor but his performance here is atrocious. The screenplay is clearly going the crazy dangerous route with its villain, but this comes across as irredeemably annoying, with Mitchum spewing adolescent threats and insults while largely failing at being intimidating.

Even though the movie makes a point of focusing on various hostages who don't actually affect the story too much, one guy who doesnt get much of a personality at all is the hero. When he first appeared, I thought Bryan Genesse was a side character because of his lack of charisma, and he never gains any throughout the runtime. Genesse was apparently on board with the movie, performing his own stunts while running across and hopping about the moving train, but hes just so generic here that the role could have been played by anybody. This homogeny carries over to the action content, which is comprised mainly of shootouts and a few explosions. Genesse only has two fight scenes, and while the brawl with Mitchum came as a surprise for being anything other than dismal, they're not worth talking about.

Death Train doesnt bear thinking about too much: I get grumpy about having wasted my money and want to rate it even lower. I cant recommend it to anyone, and hope that it only finds its way into the hands of its particular niche audience  whoever that may include.",1458518400,,3067,5.251020408163265
7987697,5,B00008WJDT,"Not the greatest of acting from the main character, the supporting actors did a better job. Good story line, but Bentley Mitchum was great as the psycho inmate.  Though it is a B movies it is very entertaining If you liked con air you will like Death Train",1387929600,,256,4.333333333333333
7987698,2,B00008WJDT,"Filled with every cliche imaginable, DEATH TRAIN is one of those films shot in Bulgaria that tries to emulate both the US and Mexico.  Action star Bryan Genessee is starting to rival Stephen Baldwin in his low key, somewhat soporific performances.  Bentley Mitchum fares somewhat better as the truly psychotic madman who is holding a trainload of caricatures hostage.  We have the asthmatic priest; the pregnant lady; the crippled boy; the young newlyweds, etc.  The henchmen are just as bad as Mitchum including the requisite female who is just as dangerous as her male counterparts.  The action sequences are tired and unimaginative; and the director uses several of the same scenes over and over in trying to fill the movie's extended length.  Few movies have ever made walking on top of a moving train look so easy.  Avoid unless you have nothing else to watch.",1124668800,2,865,4.924137931034482
7987699,1,B00008WJDT,"This was a dumb movie.  All I remember was something about a ""pit-bull puppy.""  This was a dumb movie.  We watched it in San Jose Costa Rica and laughed the whole time.  The director and the actors should be shot for filming this movie.",1096502400,,236,4.295454545454546
7987700,4,B00008WJDT,Bryan Genesse from TV's Street Justice Stars in Grade B Actioner about a group of deranged criminals take over a train whith a renagade CIA Operative on Board. Usual action no big surprises but the viewer gets to see some great action sequences on and off the Train. The Only problem i have with the film is the ending was too incoherent It seemed like the director wanted the movie to end in a lame way. The film's strong point is Bentley Mitchum the villian of the film took great relish in portraying a psycho mouthy killer with a meanstreak who gets what he derserves. Not a bad film i have seen much worse in the past. At least this film can hold my attention.,1086652800,,665,4.328
7987701,4,B00008WJDT,"This film is a great b-movie action flick; far superior than Van Damme's ""Derailed"" from a year earlier.  The main character in this movie is also one of the stars from my favorite movie ever, Operation Delta Force 3.  But in this movie, Brian Genesse is alone as he tackles the ruthless terrorists one at a time, in the tradition of Steven Seagal and Bruce Willis.  It was also nice to see Genesse's natural fighting abilities when he was battling the bad guy boss at the end of the film.  Without any obvious stuntman, Genesse handles himself quite well.
The final scene of the movie is awesome as his Mexican Federale friend hands him the Tequila bottle for the second time and poor Brian is still out of breath after his first swig.  A wide eyed Brian mutters ""My turn?"", as he grabs the bottle from his friend, not quite ready to take another gulp of the potent liquor.
Nice action movie.  After seeing it, I am going to buy it.",1064880000,3,933,4.426900584795321
