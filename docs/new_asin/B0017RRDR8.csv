8266999,3,B0017RRDR8,"OK 1960's British, rather tepid, thriller.  I call it a thriller because there is not much of a mystery here.  A mercenary amoral woman, with her artist lover, plan to do away with her wealthy, blind composer husband.  They try but the husband is only blind, not stupid.  There is an unexpected (to me) surprise near the end.  I viewed the RetroFlix DVD-R and the quality is pretty good.",1453507200,,387,4.550724637681159
8267000,4,B0017RRDR8,"I am mainly writing about this purchase because it was listed as all region. It was sent from England. It did not play in my USA DVD player. Fortunately, it did play in my computer drive. It seems to be a good transfer according to my computer screen. I am a Barbara Shelley fan. I had not seen this early film with her in it. Usually she plays a proper English woman who is victimized by some evil being or person. In this film, she is the villain. She conspires to kill her husband for his money. This story would be standard fare for a Hitchcock film. Any one who likes murder mysteries would like it. The cast all give excellent performances. I just wanted potential buyers to know that this may not play in a US or Canada DVD player. Make sure you know what types of DVDs your player will play before spending your money on it.",1371945600,2,832,4.238993710691824
