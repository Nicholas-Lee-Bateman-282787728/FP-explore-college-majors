8761870,3,B01FZ8IFRQ,"This is a strange story and contradicts itself repeatedly, centers on magic with non-binding and incompatible actions, but, in spite of that, still manages to be more or less entertaining.  If you like magic, swordplay, and unrealistic combat, you will likely love this series.

The one thing it seems to have to set it apart is merging of technological items, like cars or guns, with magical power and behavior, and then blends in monsters, both good and bad, and just whip the broth.",1532563200,,485,4.831325301204819

8761877,5,B01FZ8IFRQ,"I originally purchased ""Chaika"" wholly sight unseen style - I knew almost nothing about it save for the title.

Now here at the end of the 2nd season, I can easily say it was TRULY superb...and even better over the second season / wrap to the series. So few anime get an actual (or closed) ending anymore. We're often lift with a ton of questions, hanging out there forever unless you decide to move to the manga. Fortunately this is not the case for ""Chaika"".

I don't want to give even the slightest thing away so I'm going to use a very broad stroke for the rest: through the final season we learn a little more about the Saboteurs, some of their history, & a bit on their devotion (to a master after taking a job - AND when that job is complete), as well as a *LOT* more about Chaika, and the other Chaikas. Not to mention their father, the former Emperor Gaz.

Chaika Trabant (white Chaika) while naive to the Nth degree, constantly brings *her* A-game and works feverishly to complete her task collecting her father's remains to mourn him. I couldn't help but love her from start to finish...she's a WONDERFULLY adorable little character. We also learn some of the other Chaika's reasons for hunting the remains, specifically that everything isn't as it appears.

The English cast did a fantastic job right from jump street and never missed a beat IMO through the final uttered syllable. Kira Vincent-Davis was amazing as white Chaika, and Brittney Karbowski was just as perfect for red Chaika. Leraldo Anzaldua and Joanne Bonasso (who still to me sounds exactly like Maggie Flecknoe) brought to life Toru and Akari, respectively, perfectly. (I won't list every name and VA, but the full cast and crew deserve their kudos - everyone knocked it out of the park.)

The ending was excellent in my opinion - there are parts throughout that are happy, sad, funny, despondent, etc...and the ending was no different. It had a mixture of several emotions for me. But I can honestly say I was exceedingly pleased with the end of the series ""Chaika"" and I'm glad I purchased it. It deserves a place on every collector's shelves.",1475452800,3,2124,4.653333333333333
