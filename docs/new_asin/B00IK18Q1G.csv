8642782,4,B00IK18Q1G,"This box set includes 3 operas in their original DVD cases, housed in a thin cardboard box. The operas are:

L'ELISIR D'AMORE (3.9 stars)  2006
Heidi Grant Murphy is Adina. Paul Groves is Nemorino. Ambrogio Maestri is Dulcamara. Edward Gardner conducts the Orchestre de l'Opra national de Paris. The singing is generally excellent. Early on, Murphy is sometimes overwhelmed by the orchestra. Paul Groves has a fine voice. As an actor he makes the right movements, but his emotional involvement doesn't kick in until the end. The story is brought forward to the 20th century, making an unbelievable story even more unbelievable. What modern farmers would buy magical elixirs from a traveling quack in a truck?

DON PASQUALE (4.1 stars)  2007
Simone Alaimo is Don Pasquale. Norman Shankle is Ernesto. Parizia Ciofi is Norina. Evelino Pid conducts the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande. This modernized production is very entertaining. The singing is excellent; the acting is particularly excellent. The opera opens in a caf instead of Don Pasquale's house, which is a poor choice. Pasquale dances around annoying customers; he and his nephew talk to each other from across the room which surely annoys them more. The scenery and costumes support the story well. At the end Pasquale marries one of his servants.

LE CONVENIENZE ED INCONVENIENZE TEATRALI aka VIVA LA MAMMA  (4.4 stars)  2009
Jessica Pratt is Daria. Simon Bailey is Procolo. Christian Senn is Biscroma Strappaviscere. Marco Guidarini conducts at La Scala. This opera presents the comedic story of an opera company. Both the singing and acting are excellent. The scenery is adequate. The costumes are exaggerated in the spirit of the comedy.
