8087334,1,B000BITUUW,"I am NOT much of a cook, but am trying to learn with my young kids (ages 6 & 7) by my side.  I bought this DVD in  hopes that we would get some good general cooking information.  We got ONE recipe (muffin tin eggs - not exactly something we will do often!), along with a LOT of ""filler"" - lame jokes and so on.  I guess I had assumed we be watching them scramble, fry, hardboil, make an omelette, prep an egg casserole, get ideas for additions (cheese, ham, bell peppers, etc.).  I thought they would discuss when you use a frypan vs. the oven vs. a pot, whisk vs. spoon, spatulas, etc.  My kids don't watch much TV, so they are usually thrilled to watch anything offered, but even they didn't want to see this again.  I can't blame them - neither did I.  So I'm still on the hunt for a good cooking DVD for kids covering equipment, techniques, ingredients, etc.",1350691200,5,862,4.213414634146342
