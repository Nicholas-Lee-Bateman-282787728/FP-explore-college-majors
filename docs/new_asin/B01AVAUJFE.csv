7613595,5,B01AVAUJFE,I watched this movie on a friends recommendation and found it very interesting. It's a story of the emotion and struggle that go into competitive bodybuilding. Anyone interested in fitness and perseverance should watch the movie for a behind the scenes look into a world very few people inhabit.,1453852800,3,295,5.040816326530612
7613596,5,B01AVAUJFE,"This moive is one of go to sources for motivation for life in general, it was amazingly prouduced and has a tremendous cast!!

Rest in peace to the legendary Greg Plitt!! Legacy lives on!!",1453852800,2,188,4.529411764705882
7613597,5,B01AVAUJFE,"Saw this film when it first came out and it truly moved me. I'm not a competitor or strive to be but I live a fit lifestyle. The cast in The Perfect Physique reminded me that everyone goes through struggle but how you emerge from that smoke is what defines you. Although fitness related, the teachings in the film can be applied every single day.",1453852800,2,346,4.338461538461538
7613598,5,B01AVAUJFE,"This was an amazing documentary! It is perfect for people in as well as not in the fitness community. Each one of the guys is a true inspiration, with his own journey to tell!!!",1453852800,2,177,4.235294117647059
7613599,1,B01AVAUJFE,"Literally THE worst fitness documentary I've ever seen. Between the poor production, lack of direction, and terrible music it felt very ""adult film-like"" and cheesy. I would describe it as a polar opposite of Generation Iron (Generation Iron was fantastic). Even for someone who is very familiar with the fitness industry and Men's Physique as a division, it was hard to follow and straight up awkward. Don't waste your time.",1483488000,2,425,5.085714285714285
7613600,4,B01AVAUJFE,"This film emphasizes the endeavor behind attaining perfection. Great accomplishments require great, and in this case, Herculean effort. Seeking perfection in the human form is not just a modern undertaking. It takes Fierce determination, tenacity, and health in body, mind and spirit. I was touched by how many of these young men had chosen to combat their personal demons and life's obstacles in the gym.  This film provides an interesting look inside the world of bodybuilding and fitness modeling and personal training.",1483488000,,522,5.365853658536586
7613601,2,B01AVAUJFE,They work so hard to look hyper masculine but act like whining little girls most of the video. I'd be embarrassed. Even if you watched it with no sound you could clearly pick up on the temper tantrums.,1477440000,6,201,4.315789473684211
7613602,5,B01AVAUJFE,Ok .Genial,1475884800,,10,4.5

7613604,1,B01AVAUJFE,Terrible movie. So cheesy and fake. Everything was so scripted and ungenuine. Didn't learn anything beneficial. Actually dissuaded me from the sport. It reminded me of a reunion episode of the real world.,1474848000,7,204,5.212121212121212
7613605,2,B01AVAUJFE,"I saw this movie at a special showing.  Was pretty cheesy and yes, we all have struggles we go through, but it was made so Hollywood that it dragged on the same stories long enough that it became boring.",1473292800,,203,4.205128205128205
7613606,4,B01AVAUJFE,"So informative, motivational & inspiring! Anyone interested or already into fitness/competing should definitely watch!",1472515200,,118,7.5
7613607,4,B01AVAUJFE,"I expected more of a training video, not so much a kumbaya about the challenges in their life. It was interesting however to see their daily struggles and different insights.",1461888000,,174,4.833333333333333

I'm a big fan of this movie ",1458432000,,176,4.176470588235294
7613610,5,B01AVAUJFE,Great motivation. Very happy that there is finally a movie for physique ppl to relate to. RIP Greg Plitt.,1455753600,,105,4.578947368421052
7613611,5,B01AVAUJFE,The Perfect Physique is a very moving film that give insights into the motivations and personal struggles of the top fitness models and Men's Physique competitors. You don't have to be in the industry to be able to connect with the cast and find the motivation in your own life to not only get in better shape but to become a better person! Must see film!,1454371200,,355,4.393939393939394
7613612,4,B01AVAUJFE,"This film brings together some of the world's top fitness cover models and top IFBB physique competitors. They exchange career experiences; we see them in gruelling gym workouts as well as posing in front of the camera. Each guy gets to tell an emotional story what motivated him to enter the fitness community.

All the guys are gorgeous with amazing physiques and it seems that casting was based on looks to a great extent. Half of the guys competed in IFBB physique competitions and the rest landed magazine covers that took them to the top of the fitness community without competing. This leads to a certain rivalry but in my opinion the cover models have the winning edge when it comes to looks and charisma: The tragically deceased Greg Plitt generously shares experiences from his successful modeling career;, T. J. Hoban shows a lot of skin in a shower scene and David Kimmerle definitely has the looks of a Hollywood leading man.

However, in my opinion David Morin is the hottest man in the cast and with a sense of humour in addition to his Greek God physique. David Morin's story about entering the fitness community involves the break-up of a marriage leading to him being eager for attention. I guess attention from women comes easily these days - it's difficult to imagine a more beautiful man.

The classification ""gay interest"" is self-evident but the film could also be of interest to anyone wanting to find out the driving forces of the world's top male cover models and physique competitors.",1454112000,,1511,4.803846153846154
7613613,5,B01AVAUJFE,"This film reminds me that ""you don't know the story behind someone's glory..."" We may see these beautiful men on fitness magazines or with trophies in their  hand on Facebook after a fitness compwtition, but not know all that they went through and go through to achieve their success and maintain it. I was touched by the vulnerability and sharing in this movie and also by the passion and dedication of each of these beautiful men. I highly recommend buying and watching this movie!!!

7613614,5,B01AVAUJFE,MUST WATCH! I had no idea how intense this movie would be?!  You can really appreciate these guys in the fitness industry. The stories to this movie are raw and real. TJ Hoban is my favorite and Matts story brought me to tears. These guys are pretty rad!,1454025600,,254,4.291666666666667
7613615,5,B01AVAUJFE,This movie is the most genuine and realistic documentary about the fitness industry.  The participants in the movie are sincere and motivational.  A must watch for anyone interested in living a fitness based life.,1454025600,,213,5.235294117647059
7613616,5,B01AVAUJFE,"Being a part of this film was an honor and a blessing.  The best part of it, no doubt, was forming a brotherhood with the other guys in the film. I can't tell you how many times people send me messages or come up to me on the street and tell me how incredible the film was. It's truly an inspiring and a heartfelt story about how each of us have used fitness and bodybuilding to overcome adversity.  This movie will leave you feeling inspired and ready to train like a freak.  ",1454025600,,477,4.1521739130434785
7613617,5,B01AVAUJFE,One of the most inspirational and motivating movies that not only makes you want to train harder but grabs hold of your heart as these athletes share their intimate stories of the challenges they have had to overcome to be the top athletes in world! A must see for anyone wanting a real life changing experience!,1454025600,,312,4.589285714285714
7613618,5,B01AVAUJFE,"Awesome movie. I own the blu ray and it is a splendid transfer. Very moving stories told here, very artistically done in hi-def. Music, editing, direction and cinematography all top notch.",1453939200,2,188,5.096774193548387
8748536,5,B01AVAUJFE,Bromance at it's finest. I hope they make more.,1500508800,,47,4.333333333333333
8748537,3,B01AVAUJFE,"If you are serious about working out, you'll probably like it.  It's not a how to, but it does offer insight into the lives of those who are able to make their living with their bodies.  They are more cerebral about it than most people probably think.",1499817600,,251,4.319148936170213
8748538,1,B01AVAUJFE,"Horrible..these dudes need to get a life and quit lieing to the whole world about these supplements making them gain muscle year around.  They clearly on tren, test, IGF, growth hormone, insulin and many other things.  Narcissistic is a good name for all of them.  Most of them
Photoshop all their photos and lie to the real world.  Basically fraud",1495584000,,348,4.75
8748539,2,B01AVAUJFE,Terrible music choice. So melodramatic throughout. Weird editing choices. Good to hear their perspective but hearing that stupid music was awful.,1495411200,,145,5.9523809523809526
8748540,4,B01AVAUJFE,"I watched this ""documentary"" on Netflix because I`m a documentary junkie... This documentary feels like an infomercial at times and it was not what I was expecting but I still enjoyed most of it. The supplement company that funded this takes a gentle approach but nonetheless, when it comes to discuss supplements, they make sure to give you a good view of what exactly they sell.

The majority of the film takes place in a beautiful house where they sit around and talk on the couch, the kitchen, and hang out by the fire in the evening. I found the parts of the film where the guys share their own stories to be touching. It definitely added another dimension to the film which I appreciate.

There were several good nuggets of wisdom for anyone who is on the journey of fitness and a healthier lifestyle.

My biggest gripe with this film is that 3-4 individuals get most of the attention in the film. Even though Colin Wayne is in this, he hardly speaks and is hardly given any camera time. Definitely google him to learn about his inspirational story.",1494633600,,1055,4.571428571428571

8748542,3,B01AVAUJFE,"What an unexpected pleasure! I had no notion of what was to transpire, but I noticed that one of the performers was Greg Plitt, who was
killed in a train accident in Burbank in 2015. Greg had an impressive resume (e.g. West Point, Ranger), but is mostly remembered for his slammin body and for being one of the top fitness icons of all time. I wanted to hear him and see him and this interview and discussion of what these individuals do to compete is fascinating and moving. Yes, there's a MetRx product placement, but this film is mostly about the journey these guys have been on and how they were inspired to do what they are now doing. It is touching and inspirational. I wonder why the one black guy in the bunch wasn't interviewed? It is a glaring omission and a missed opportunity-what a shame. (BTW: I saw this on Netflix).",1486598400,,831,4.437908496732026
8748543,2,B01AVAUJFE,"Not the worst fitness/bodybuilding doc I've ever seen, but I've seen many and this one I have to put in the category of cheesy, lame and an eye-roller several times through. I have a hard time getting through the background music that seemingly plays the ENTIRE time through, it's very distracting and at one point seems to transition into the ""Broke back Mountain"" type of soundtrack, that's where I started to get scared. Count how many times the later Greg Plitt says ""man"" and you'll lose count by about 134. The crying and whining solidifies these guys as true narcissist personality disorders ""bros"" that may need some counseling because they all seem to have intense baggage.",1484179200,2,682,4.887931034482759
8748544,1,B01AVAUJFE,"I watched it on Netflix, mainly because I saw it as a recommendation and thought it might actually be about improving one's level of conditioning.  Instead I found out it was about a bunch of vapid dudes talking about how focused they are, how rough it is to be in their sport, and how evolved and superior they are to the rest of us otherwise average people.  Overall it was lame, overly dramatic (in a very contrived way) and reinforced to me the stereotype of the dumb musclehead.  The guys in this have impressive physiques but somehow come across as sniveling babies.  I much prefer the Arnold docu-drama ""Pumping Iron"" to this crap.",1483747200,3,638,4.619469026548672
8748545,1,B01AVAUJFE,Totally scripted and fake Q&As. Fake training clips. Ridiculous answers to what they take as supplements.,1483747200,,105,5.625
