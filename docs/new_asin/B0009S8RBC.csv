And no, there is not one iota of English anywhere on these DVDs: no subtitles, no alternate soundtrack, nothing, nada.  (I mean rien de tout.)  The only ways to get English are the Region-2 PAL DVDs (not good for us barbarians) and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Russian-discs/dp/B000V1S1MC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">* Russian* discs</a>&nbsp;(no region encoding), where you turn on the British subtitles (and the French soundtrack, to prevent the Russian overdubbing!).

That makes this pair of 1972 spy/romance farces most useful for high school students studying French!  I would definitely suggest giving these to any student because the broad language, and mild (comedic) sexual situations will make them sit up and take notice.  Then the physical comedy will make it possible to intuit some of the translation, even if their vocabulary is a little weak.  Say, a third-year student, more or less?  Of course it's a dated comedy, but still Pierre Richard has great slapstick timing, and Mireille Darc has outstanding... well, um, buttocks.  Jean Rochefort as Colonel Toulouse has a repetoire of vague and villanous faces appropriate for the ambiguously good-guy/bad-guy secret service role.  Any high school student will love it -- there's even a bit of delicate bathroom humor.

As to the actual plot, does it matter, really?  But you can read it on IMDB or somewhere if you wish.  I love these movies, but it's not the sort of thing you can explain in a review.  (Imagine trying to tell someone how the in-jokes, slapstick, and rudeness of a Monty Python show was actually funny.)  I would avoid the USA re-make (The Man With One Red Shoe), and especially for language students at all costs, because it would cause them to misinterpret the plot and thus make bad guesses about the French flying past their ears.",1215129600,,2070,5.211480362537764
8066041,5,B0009S8RBC,"The Grand Blond and The Retour du Grand Blond are great movies to watch. Pierre Richard is a not-so-smart violinist that is caught in the middle of an internal dispute of the French Secret Service, and used by its boss to get rid of an unloyal second-in-command. In the first film, The Grand Blond, he never knows what is going on around him, he falls in love with a female spy sent to seduce him - and who gets instead seduced by him -, and the unloyal second-in-command finally gets what he deserves. In the second movie, yet more hillarious, he already knows, and he is forced to play the great spy he is not. He is still going to prevail. A lot of fun ...",1133654400,2,659,4.238095238095238
