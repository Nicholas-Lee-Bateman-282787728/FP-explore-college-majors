4648889,5,B005BX3LWK,"As a pro drummer and educator for almost 30 years I have seen most of what is available out there as far as instructional videos/DVDs. Through everything, Steve Gadd's ""up close"" and ""in session"" remained the best, simply because of their musical content.

I have known JR for 10 years and had the pleasure of doing a duo clinic tour of Scandinavia with him back in 2004 for Yamaha as well as a couple of Yamahas Groove Nights. His non-chops focus and dedication to the groove and the music is what has kept him a hard working drummer to this day. His eyes lights up when he talks about good music and he shows an enthusiasm that is awe inspiring.

Time Machine is the DVD that I recommend to all my students and at clinics. It deals with drum tuition the way it is supposed to be, musical, practical and hands on, not trying to make you an athlete. It will give players of all levels invaluable tools and knowledge presented by a humble, dedicated living legend.",1360108800,,963,4.435028248587571

4648891,5,B005BX3LWK,Mr. Robinson's DVD is an excellent source of information about John's musical concepts and recording work. Think how much it might cost to take even one lesson from him and you'll know what an excellent buy this is.,1350172800,2,215,4.684210526315789
4648892,5,B005BX3LWK,"This video, to me, is one of the very best ever. The reason I say this is because of the inspirational value it has to me. Seldom has one made me go to my kit every time I watch it. There is tremendous relevance in what JR is presenting here. Lots of things can be practically applied to ones own playing and they are attainable! Things I haven't thought of before come up.

Many DVDs focus so much on chops and technique that the musical drumming portion gets left behind. I love JR and Steve Gadd for their absolute gift to the music they're playing.

The DVD is recorded very well and the fellow musicians that JR has with him are superb! It's worth every dollar to have this video.

I had the pleasure of meeting and talking with JR last summer (2011) and he is one marvelous man as well.",1327363200,5,792,4.231788079470198
4648893,4,B005BX3LWK,"I'm an absolute junkie for drumming DVDs collecting over 40 of 'em over the decades.  They come in different varieties.  Some are just inspirational.  You get to see and hear an excellent musician play but other than inspriation, you don't learn much.  Some are fabulous instructional videos that teach basic to advanced, obvious to subtle points.  JoJo Mayer's DVD is probably the best example.  Some include the musical ""approach"" a drummer takes to developing his part of a piece.  This DVD does some of all of this.  For the ""early intermediate"" player, this is probably a 4-5 star DVD.  For a late-intermediate to advanced player, it's more of a 3 star, so I gave it an average of 4 stars.
First, Mr Robinson delivers an incredible amount of information in this 2 DVD set.  Only JoJo Mayer's, Todd Sucherman's, and some of Tommy Igoe's DVDs can compare for shear amount of info offered.

At first glance, especially for the first of the two DVD set, it seems JR's offering will be more of the inspirational variety with lots of excellent musicians playing some tunes (featuring JR of course).  But if you watch the entire 2 DVD set, you'll see that there is much more here.

Content:  Instructinal DVDs are generally targeted at a beginning to intermediate audience.  Truly advanced players are too small and too diverse an audience for an instructional DVD to be economically successful.  Almost every aspect of intermediate-level playing is touched on, some more than others.  The exception being rudiments and fills.  No attention is given this specific element of drumming. Most of the instructional content is on the 2nd DVD shich covers:
-- tuning (better than nothing, but a bit superficial - see Bob Gatzen's offering for a more thorough approach, JR does go into different tuning approaches for jazz / rock etc)
-- hand technique (very limited but OK, but honestly after JoJo Mayer's DVD, everything else by everyone else is hollow by comparison)
-- drum micing (actually pretty good with some detail -- only Dave Weckl and Dennis Moody's DVDs meet or exceed this oft neglected topic)
-- playing with a percussionist (rarely covered by anyone and only superficially covered in this DVD, but some insightful recommendations)
-- playing with a click (JR has a NATURAL gift for timing and doesn't hiself play with a click track but suggests others do and makes a couple of suggestion how to use a click track

Overall this DVD set is a valuable hodge podge collection of info for the aspiring drummer with limited experience, but with the commitment to get to the next level.  Even the ""late-intermediate"" player will occasionally find some very interesting points presented in a slightly different way, or with an exceptional demo by JR.  These tend to be peppered throughout the two DVDs so you have to watch everthing to pick them up.  The style and approach of this DVD is similar to Todd Sucherman's offerings.  IMO, Todd's are targeted at the slightly more advanced player and he goes into a bit more detail in his explanations and recommendations.  The strength of this DVD (the breadth of material covered) is also a weakness.  None of the topics are covered in much detail.  One aggravation to me is the repeated cameos by his colleagues telling us why JR is such a good drummer.  OK.  Great, but that's not all that important to the viewer.  I mean after the Quincy Jones cameo endorsement, what (additional) good are any of the others?  The viewer get little to nothing from that, and it's the return on their time and money investment that must be served, not the ego of the author (it's doubley strange because JR seems so humble - not egotistical at all).

Delivery:  JR is an outstanding drummer, probably one of the rare breed of near-millsecond-accurate drummers like Steve Gadd and Gavin Harrison.  If he's playing the back beats 10 milliseconds late, it's because he INTENDS to play it that way, and does so on every bar.  Fantastic!  He also seems to be a fairly ""normal"" guy who clearly enjoyed making the DVD.  For most of the DVDs he has a fairly clear idea of what he wants to get across and doesn't waste too much time getting to it.  Some topics are traditionally fuzzy to present.  Hey, the term ""groove"" is one of the most used, and vague terms in drumming.  Even highly accomplished professionals can't seem to explain it or demonstrate it clearly.  I've heard more times than I care, mediocre to poor DVD authors say things like ""you have to feel/play the groove"", with no coherent explanation of what that means to them (or anyone), nor how an aspiring drummer can pursue this as a goal.  JR starts with the same recommendation, BUT goes on to explain and shows precisely what he means.  He also often (but alas not in every case) recommends how to achieve the goal for those less gifted and experienced than he.  He provides perhaps the BEST example I've seen of the ""groove"" difference between playing a simple pattern absolutely metronomically, and the ""groove"" way of playing some elements of the pattern ever-so-slightly displaced.  In his personal style, that typically means being slightly behind the beat for some of the rhythmic elements.  It's how he joins metronomic elements with slightly displaced elements that establishes the ""groove"", the lilt or swing.  Absolutely fantastic demo for this on the first DVD.  That's probably the highlight of the entire DVD set.  If you can't see and hear and feel the ""groove"" with his demo, you should probably look to another instrument -- drums are probably not the best choice for you. As an example of a more advanced concept, he points out that this drumming grove works best when the drummer is recorded with the other musicians as opposed to over-dubbing after the fact, because all the other players need to hear and respond to the drummer's groove.  It wouldn't sound quite right to overdub a swung grove on top of an otherwise stright 8th recording from the other rhythm elements (bass, piano etc).  This excellent demo of ""groove"" could be worth the price of the DVD for many viewers.  Spot on.  As an example of the instructional elements, he provides some explanations for why young drummers will often rush or drag and offers suggestions about how to prevent or fix this.

Production Quality - Audio and video are quite good.  This isn't a ""technique"" video per se, so you don't consistently get multiple video shots of all JR's 4 limbs in action.  It's mostly a heads on, or fron atop view, but the overall lighting and video production are good with fairly tight and non-distracting editing.  Audio is good.  It's not a totally dry recording for most of the DVD (some at the end of the 2nd DVD appears to be the totally dry).  You can tell there's been some processing of the drum channels etc, but it's not overerly processed.  You can still hear some snare buzz for example and each tom actually sounds different (as they should).  There were some missed opportunties. In the otherwise good section on drum micing, JR talks about the relative values of overhead versus close micing and attempts to compare them.  You can hear a difference, but he does not announce, and the uninitiated might not be able to tell, which audio example corresponds to which micing set up.  It was one of only a few instances where the ball was dropped from an orginizational/production point of view.

Summary:  For the intended audience and for those wanting a brief look at so many topics, this DVD is definitely a success and is well worth the money and time investment.",1325116800,21,7564,4.783346183500385

8464431,5,B005BX3LWK,A great buy.  John really explains a lot of things in such a short period of time.  His versatility is awesome.  I grew up listening to him play drums and he is one of my influences.  Met him in person at the Chicago Drum Show in 2012 and he is a nice guy as well.,1424131200,,264,3.7454545454545456
8464432,3,B005BX3LWK,Not what I expected.  More commercial than substance.  I did learn what a great drummer Mr Robinson is.  I wanted to know more about what would help me make a great drummer.,1391385600,,173,4.34375
8464433,5,B005BX3LWK,"This DVD is a steal.  Get it now and watch it repeatedly.  It is not only instructive at any level but empowering.  A lot of reviews tend to balk at JR's confidence level.  In this instance it is part of the lessons.  Just have a look at the first essay in Charley Wilcoxon's quaint and antiquated Snare Drum Method.  His first treatise is on the value of confidence.  Not the kind that makes you merely ""wrong and strong"" but the kind that is necessary to be a good drummer. This confidence can wear a gracious smile like Louis Bellson genuinely possessed or it can snarl like Buddy Rich. In John JR Robinson's case every word and note should be studied as I said: repeatedly. Just like the first 3 pages of Stick Control.  Also the inexpensive pricing must be an error in favor of the student!  Thats a crazy price for such a gem.
I like sharing this video with my students and love it more each time.  The comments on time and other heartfelt expressions freely given by JR's colleagues; all of which live on Mt. Olympus with the Gods of the music industry are wonderful when you think about it.  How would you like to be so beloved among your colleagues?  This should be the goal of any true musician.  This is what Earl Palmer had, what Al Harewood had, Cedar Walton, Freddie Green, Sonny Payne...these are guys who aren't in your face but they conduct electricity better than intel routes.
I studied with Saul Goodman and Roland Kohloff.  They were also in the back of the orchestra but I would truly love to have a whole DVD of them talking and playing and listening to their colleagues;  the likes of Toscanni, and Bernstein and Bartok talk about what it was like to work with ""Saul"" and Roland.  This DVD gives us a giant on a silver platter.  Get it and be grateful it exists.  So many greats like Miles and Tony didn't even get on film till it was so late.  If you are getting the impression I like this DVD you are right.  You will too.",1377043200,,1948,4.358333333333333
8464434,5,B005BX3LWK,"Hi fellow drummers!
I have to disagree with the comments of other reviews, which say that there is too much of a band performance and not enough education.
It is true that there are a lot of fusion-like band performances, that are sometimes a little too long. But the 2nd DVD is packed with tips about miking, tuning, hand and foot technique, and how to dealt with a click track. So it is a good insight into studio drummiing, and packed with a lot of good tips. One of the good drumming DVD`s",1376179200,,493,4.311827956989247
8464435,4,B005BX3LWK,I wish I got to hear more about his technique than about how everyone thinks he's such a gifted drummer.  Of course I think he's gifted!  I bought the CD didn't I?,1375747200,2,163,4.0625
8464436,5,B005BX3LWK,"This has to one of the most in-demand and recorded drummers of all time!  I had the honor of meeting him in person a couple of years ago. A talented man and a warm person. This characteristic, and monster playing, comes through on this 2 dvd set. If only they would put his studio/groove playing vhs from a few years ago on dvd!",1373414400,,328,4.2063492063492065
8464437,3,B005BX3LWK,"I'll be honest; I've watched this DVD a couple times through and was hoping the second time would change my opinion (because I really wanted it to be one of the best in my collection), but this just isn't the case. I expected it to be nothing but valuable information from a venerable studio drummer, and make no mistake, there is definitely a good bit of information to be found here for drummers who aspire to be successful in a studio setting. But here's my issue: all three hours of this DVD set are riddled with useless cameos from musicians who have worked with Mr. Robinson. Just as I was really getting into what JR was preaching, it would cut to a guy talking about how he's the greatest drummer ever. After awhile, you start thinking to yourself, ""OK, I get it. This guy is solid as a rock. But I don't need these guys reinforcing that which I am already aware."" Lets face it, if you didn't think John Robinson was a great drummer, you wouldn't have bought his DVD in the first place.

As a drummer of twelve years, I don't consider myself a beginner. If I was just starting out, I could have seen myself really enjoying this DVD. But as it stands, this is easily one of the most pretentious drum instructional videos I have ever seen. It's basically the exact polar opposite of Jeff Porcaro's DVD, which is the ultimate definition of a quality drum instructional video.

This video would have been so much better had they thrown all the cameos and a large majority of the band performances on the second disc, leaving the bread and butter instructional material on the first disc. At least then you could take in what JR has to say without distractions.

In short, this is worth the eight dollars I paid for it, but I wouldn't pay a dime more; three stars.",1370563200,2,1767,4.447530864197531
8464438,5,B005BX3LWK,JR has been one of my drumming heroes since the early 80s.  If you are serious about understanding time and feel as a drummer you have to buy this DVD.  The man is one of the greatest session masters ever and it's a wonderful opportunity to study his artistry in this presentation.  Groove on JR!!!!,1366156800,,299,4.4
