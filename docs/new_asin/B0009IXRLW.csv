2293262,5,B0009IXRLW,"After the World Series Film and ""Faith Rewarded"" I was left with the feeling that only the complete original broadcasts would fully satisfy any Red Sox fan. I never thought MLB would release all the games in one set.  This might be a one shot deal. What other team's fans would care enough about their teams to shell out $100.00 for a DVD set?  Only Sox fans commemorating the ending of the Curse of the Bambino!!I love it...I could not believe my eyes when I saw the set listed!!",1120176000,6,480,4.382022471910112

2293264,4,B0009IXRLW,"A number of other reviews in this forum berated the poor video quality of this package and other production values.  Perhaps I have a later edition, or perhaps my standards are lower, but I have no complaints about the overall quality.  It does appear that they came from an analog master (digital broadcasts still being in their relative infancy in 2004), but compared to my VHS recordings of the same games, I have no complaints.

Regarding the games themselves, my only two issues are (1) the absence of the ALDS, which to me (and many other, apparently) is inexplicable, and (2) the fact that they edited out most if not all of the pre- and post-game studio pieces, which would certainly help put each game in its context.  Fortunately, I have both these discrepancies on my own personal recordings (again, VHS, but better than nothing), so I'll probably edit together my own supplemental set.

My only complaint is regarding the Bonus DVD.  The 2004 World Series Film is about the quality you'd expect from MLB, so no problem there.  The remaining features, or really featurettes, are by and large laughable.  Let's review:

SCHILLING SPEAKS TO FANS -- a brief piece showing Schill taking a few questions in a fan forum at Fenway after the season, with very poor audio quality and equally poor editing, and dialogue (when audible) that really adds nothing to what we already knew.

CELEBRITY FANS ON THE BIG WIN -- a brief piece showing three, unidentified, supposedly celebrity Sox fans talking about their memories from the season.  One of the individuals is Denis Leary; I have no idea who the other two are (their names are on the jacket, I later realized).  Captions might have helped.  More to the point -- are these the top 3 ""celebrities"" they could dig up?  I generally consider a ""celebrity"" somebody I'd recognize without any help.

AROYO:  PITCHER BY DAY, MUSICIAN BY NIGHT -- Bronson Arroyo says a few words, walks into a studio, and we see him singing ""Dirty Water.""  This would be worthwhile if (a) he knew the words, (b) they didn't edit out the last verse, and (c) Arroyo actually could sing.  Other than that, it was pretty good...

ALCS GAME 7 POST-GAME CELEBRATION -- Interesting at first, but we've seen many of these clips in separate features already, and the editing could be a lot better.

FRANCONA TAKES OVER -- Expecting a feature on how Francona was hired and his early days at the helm, maybe getting into Spring Training, we get a 2-minute sound-bite from his press conference.  That's it.  Nothing else.  Really.

BEST OF ORTIZ WIRELESS -- Generally inaudible or unintelligible snippets of Big Papi throughout the season talking to other people.

ALCS GAME 1:  TIMLIN & EMBREE WIRELESS -- Idle comments of two relief pitchers during batting practice.  Yawn.

MILLAR SPEAKS WITH DAN SHAUGHNESSY -- Millar makes his now-famous statement ""don't let us win tonight"" prior to Game 4 of the ALCS.

DAMON SHAVES BEARD -- Yippee.

RED SOX VISIT THE WHITE HOUSE -- About what you'd expect, but marred by two incidents when the (single) cameraman inexplicably points his camera skyward during the President's remarks.  Nice clouds up there.

WORLD SERIES LOCKER ROOM CELEBRATION -- See ALCS Game 7 postgame, above.

2005 RING & BANNER CEREMONY -- This was the first one I watched, as I wanted to see if it was the same as the ""History Rings True"" DVD I already purchased.  It wasn't.  It was dreadful.  Laughably bad.  This video appears to have been shot on somebody's flip phone from the Yankees dugout.  There is no narration, just the inaudible PA announcer, and no captions, so you have no idea what's going on.  They only show some of the players, skip the most poignant moment (of Johnny Pesky getting his ring), and then show *part* of the banner raising.  Unbelievably bad.

All this to say -- buy it for the games.  Even the three games they lost are worth watching (admittedly easier today as we know the final outcome) and it's a shame these losses are omitted from the 2007 and 2013 sets.  I forced myself to watch them and was glad I did, and it's good to have them on archive.  Just don't expect much from the Bonus DVD other than the World Series Film (which to most fans won't be anything new, but it's a good production).",1393545600,,4265,4.713125845737483

2293270,3,B0009IXRLW,"Just as this set advertises, it is indeed comprehensive, including a whopping eleven baseball games for those want to go back and relive the historic 2004 post season of the Bo Sox. Personally, I would never have the patience or spare time to do so, but I did enjoy skipping to the ends of the ALCS games 4-7, in which the Sox completed their dramatic and unique comeback to advance to the World Series. But there's a catch... if you want to travel back in time to witness baseball history, be prepared to do so with a presentation that is so dated, it just might hurt your eyeballs.

It's hard to believe that HD was a luxury, and not a standard in 2004, but that's the way it was. As such, each of these games are presented in SD quality that can be rather grainy and blurry, when viewed on your HD set. Additionally, they appear in 4:3 aspect, as opposed to widescreen, which further hurts the presentation. It would be nice if this set had been offered in Blu-ray, but apparently the market did not have enough HD owners at the time.",1351468800,,1037,4.373056994818653

The only drawback:  It's a shame that this dvd collection doesn't include the Sox / Angels games from the ALDS.",1191974400,,386,4.380281690140845
2293282,5,B0009IXRLW,"This was a fantastic DVD for both Sox and baseball fans alike. The drama played out in the 2004 ALCS was something that all hardcore baseball fans would appreciate from a baseball perspective.

It has all full-length games from the original FOX broadcast (without commercials) of both the ALCS and the World Series. As well, a 2004 World Series DVD that recaps the Sox all through their triumphant run. It's narrated by Denis Leary and shows a lot of behind-the-scenes footage and player interviews. Also on that bonus DVD are clips from spring training and various player-specific cuts from batting practice - ie: Millar's ""prediction"" before game 4. There is also footage of the World Series parade as well as the Ring Ceremony held on Opening Day 2005.

If you're a baseball fan and can remember how dramatic the finishes of many of the ALCS games were, this DVD set is worth it based on that alone. If you're a Sox fan, it's a must have!

Also, check out the 2001 World Series DVD. Another great series with a lot of dramatic games/finishes.",1190764800,,1045,4.699453551912568

I thinks it's a must have for every Red Sox fan. Though it doesn't have any games from the ALDS...it has all 7 from the ALCS and the four from the WS. It also has bonus DVD's and the highlight DVD. It also has a nice option where you can pick what inning you want to watch. The picture is a little fuzzy, but is still worth it.",1185926400,,493,4.092783505154639
2293285,5,B0009IXRLW,Love having these DVDs to relive the World Series with the Red Sox.  It will get you thru many a dreary winter night.,1183766400,,117,4.086956521739131
2293286,5,B0009IXRLW,"There are roughly 3 million people in the metropolitan Boston area.  Maybe 80% of them are Red Sox fans, so there are 2.4 million or so of us, along with untold but probably similar numbers elsewhere across North America.  (Go to a Red Sox game far from Boston and you'll see almost as many Red Sox fans as there are fans for the local team -- as long as you're not in Yankee Stadium.)

If you're a member of the aptly-named Red Sox Nation, this DVD set is for you, because it's NOT just the 2004 World Series.  It's everything you really want, which probably doesn't incude the four-game sweep of the Cardinals at all.  It wisely includes the whole seven game series against the Yankees, and that's certainly why I bought it.

True citizens of Red Sox Nation find the Yankees repulsive in exact proportion to their love for the Red Sox.  (OK, the Yankees have great players, but it's still fun to find them repulsive.) So even though I saw Game 5 of teh Sox-Yanees series in person and the watched rest of the games on TV, and even though I missed seeing the last two games of the World Series due to a business trip to Italy, it's the Red Sox-Yankees games that I love to watch.

The video quality is so-so.  The 12- and 14-inning games between the Sox and the Yankees are so long that they wouldn't fit on a single DVD without a lot of compression.  But hey, who cares?  The nail-biting is all there, and it's still fun to watch and wait for the thrilling endings you know are coming.

I don't own many movie DVDs, and I don't own any other sports DVDs.  But this set is special if you're a Red Sox fan, or if you love to see the underdog triumph, or if you love to see the Red Sox beat the New York Yankees.  Buy it now, and watch it every year until the Red Sox win the Series again, in another 86 years.",1181779200,3,1809,4.205797101449275

As much as I wanted to get it, I was a little hesitant because I've been reading so many reviews from people who have said the video and audio quality was lousy, the picture isn't in HD, it's full-screen, etc., but I went ahead and plopped down $100 for the set.

Very glad I did ... this set is worth every penny. It isn't HD ... so what?!? It looks as good as it did during the original broadcast. In fact, I got so caught up in watching Game 4 (the first disc I watched) that I forgot I was watching a DVD until I realized I hadn't seen a commercial. Big Papi goes deep ... and it's on to Game 5!

Any hard-core Red Sox fan will want this for their 2004 World Series collection. The extras on the 12th disc are great, too.

I've never been more disappointed in a DVD set than I am in this one. The games are so distorted on my HDTV that I can't stand watching them. These are games to treasure and to watch over and over and over again. Unfortunately I won't be able to do that with this DVD set. Beside the quality of the recording, I was disappointed in how much the games were edited down for ""time."" Some of the games are clearly more compressed to save room on the discs than others.

I also own the ""Faith Rewarded""  DVD that is similar to the bonus DVD World Series movie.  In ways, the Faith REwarded DVD is just as good, but it does not include any of the games from start to finish.  Plus, each of the discs has special trivia and facts ont he game which are very interesting.

Its hard to spend over $100 on such a shabby product but as a die hard Red Sox fan you are compelled to turn the other cheek and shell out the money because unless you taped the games on a DVR or VCR then this is the only way your going to have some of the greatest momements in Red Sox history captured pitch for pitch.

2293298,5,B0009IXRLW,"Ok. A few whiskeys and time to accept our 2005 defeat brought me to a Friday night viewing of this DVD collection. Dave Roberts' steal and the Red Sox come-from-behind miracle cause us to lose sight of the first game -- remarkable on several levels, and a prophetic view of the entire series. Some observations on the first game with the Yankees:

1. The first hit off of Mike Messina (perfect through 6 innings) was by Mark Bellhorn, and the first RBIs for the Bosox were from Kevin Millar (oh, how the times they have been a changing'!)

2. Fox sucks! Except for quoting Bruce Springsteen correctly, Al Leiter was pathetic, and he and Tim McCarver had many, many simply wrong comments. For instance, they actually said that David Ortiz's offensive numbers (as well as Carl Yastrzemski's!!!!!) were the result of the ""green monster"" in Fenway, and Leiter claimed that Schilling had been complaining about his ankle all year!!!! (Yaz turned to an ""inside-out"" swing in his later years; for most of his career, he gained his number hitting into a shift.)

3. The Sox came back from a 8-run deficit, and David Ortiz's triple came within a foot of tying the game in the 8th inning. (Never say never!)

4. Bernie Williams' doubled off of Mike Timlin in the ninth over Manny Ramirez' outstretched reach by a matter of inches. If Ramirez catches that ball, it's a one-run game in the ninth.

In other words, we remember the 3-0 defecit, and the Red Sox comeback, but if it were not for this DVD collection, I would have completely forgotten how the Sox almost came back from eight  runs to win it in the 8th inning, and how, just as Roberts stole second by a matter of inches in game 4, this first game was decided by a few hairs.

This first game was truly a hint of what was to come in the remaining games, and this DVD collection made this reminiscence and post-year analysis possible.",1132272000,9,1882,4.566765578635015

I was happy to find out that it is the actual FOX broadcasts and not some sort of international braodcast with different announcers, which the recent superbowl DVDs use.  Also, the insides of the DVD cases are great with inning by inning breakdowns of the action and complete boxscores.  There are a few things they could have done differently to improve the set. Obviously, including the 3 games against the Angels would have greatly improved the collection.  Also, the coverage of the ring ceremony is horrendous.  They took a ceremony that lasted about an hour and cut it down to around 8 minutes.  None of the ring entrances are included, but rather it starts with Francona coming out of the dug out to get his ring.  Once the players start coming out, they only show the big names, rather than the whole roster.  Also, there's no sound, which the original broadcast lacked as well, but they also don't show the names on the jumbotron, which the original broadcast did.  Oh well, I guess that's why they're selling the entire ring ceremony on another DVD.",1125964800,,1090,4.6947368421052635

Personally, my favorite part is watching Dave Roberts steal second in Game 4 of the ALCS.  There is also a bonus-DVD with some interesting stuff on it, but it isn't anything too eye-popping.

2293312,5,B0009IXRLW,"Bad News First:  No games from the series against Anaheim (which were on ESPN rather than Fox), in which David Ortiz put on a hitting clinic--a one-disc overview would have been really nice.  Really nice. . . .  Thanks, ESPN, for helping out with copyright stuff. . . .  That knocks it down to 4 1/2 stars right there.  But the real drama came with the Yankees series, though, so I'll survive.  I don't have a good enough system to notice some of the more technical picture/color/resolution issues that have been mentioned, so I'm fine with that, too, even though some others have voiced valid criticisms.  That's pretty good for bad news. . . .

The Good News:  Everything (and I mean everything!) is on these discs.  This set of DVDs is a spectacular collection of the most important ALCS in Red Sox history, some of the most exciting baseball to be played in October, and then the World Series, which seemed terribly anti-climactic somehow after Games 4 & 5 against the Yankees and a nice partial comeback by the Cardinals in Game 1 of the World Series.  Whatever I might be missing from the Anaheim series, I get back twofold from this set--back up to 5 stars.  Easy.

The Games:  Aside from a disastrous Game 3 (which might be good to watch just to keep the comeback in even better perspective), the games were close, competitive, and dramatic.  Some pretty good drama unfolded in Games 1 & 2, despite the Red Sox losses.  Game 4 showcased a classic display of determination (by both teams) within a back-and-forth struggle, ""the steal"" by Dave Roberts, and the ultimate vintage walk-off home run by Ortiz in the bottom of the 12th inning.  Game 5 followed in those big footsteps and provided possibly even more drama, with the Red Sox tying the game in the 8th inning and the two teams playing five more scoreless innings--each team with multiple opportunities to win the game, with the dramatic finish in the bottom of the 14th.  That game went close to six hours, and we missed a great game between St. Louis and Houston, because by the time this game was over, the other game was well into the 8th inning. . . .  Games 6 & 7 seemed less ""exciting,"" simply because it seemed that the Sox had all of the momentum:  Schilling pitched great in Game 6, and Lowe pitched a one-hitter through six innings in Game 7.  Every time the Yankees made a move, the Red Sox made a bigger one in response.  All of those moments are there, however, to relive in whatever fashion you choose--watch the complete games, skip around, whatever. . . .

The Setup:  The games are all there in their entirety.  However, half-inning chapter breaks make it very easy to negotiate your way through a whole bunch of baseball (Games 4 and 5 went forever. . .) in much less time than the original games took.

The Packaging:  Beautiful.  Hitting statistics, pitching stats, box scores, and inning-by-inning summaries make it easy to find a particular at-bat or half-inning (some of our memories are failing, so this feature is particularly helpful. . .).  Trivia, attendance, weather info, umpires, quotes from players, pictures of memorabilia, and a host of other things are on the cover of each DVD, making it good reading material, as well.  It's all there.  All of it.  If you need a piece of information regarding these games that is not on the cases, then you need very professional help. . .

The Bonus Features:  Some of us love them, and this set includes one disc devoted to just ""stuff,"" most importantly the 2005 Ring & Banner Ceremony, which was not included on any of the other World Series DVDs.  Interviews, player bios/features, trip to the White House, celebrity interviews, post-game celebrations, etc. are all included.  Complete postseason batting and pitching stats are on the inside of the case, also--Nice bonus. . . !

The Price:  Can you beat it. . . ?  MLB online was offering each game, but it would have ended up costing more than this set (which I bought for less than $80 at my local Bull Moose store) and would not have had any of the nice packaging offered on this set.  I could have pictured really bare-bones discs and cases, but MLB and A&E did a tremendous job putting together a quality package for a very reasonable amount of money.

Bottom Line:  If you are a fan of baseball and, in particular, a Red Sox fan, then this set is a virtual ""must-have"" for your collection.  It is the first time that MLB has done such a project, and I hope it is successful.  Who wouldn't like to have some past great World Series and playoff series to see in their entirety?  This is an invaluable resource for future generations of Red Sox fans and for baseball fans in general--hopefully a trend has been started.  The NESN DVD (Faith Rewarded) is a great summary, with some nice local insights and perspectives.  The official MLB World Series DVD (one disc) is nice, too, if you want just a summary and a few highlights.  Neither can compare to this set, though.  Some of us want the whole enchilada, and this set provides it, with a nice salsa on the side. . . .",1123632000,98,5065,4.568257491675916
2293313,2,B0009IXRLW,"Aside from the Fox/NY logo that shows up on every game -- couldn't they have rendered this set from a network master, and not a copy owned by some Fox affiliate? -- there are definite quality issues...

ALCS Games 4 & 5 have been squeezed onto 1 DVD each. A 4+ hour game on 1 DVD? Terrible. By definition, this means that the team that made these DVD's had to compress the video, thereby lowering the overall quality. That is a disservice to anyone buying this set - especially since these 2 games are among the most likely to be watched by happy Sox fans.

Interestingly, A&E/MLB seems to have acknowledged this in a unique way. Take a look at the first 8.5 innings of Game 4. Fuzzy, murky, dark picture quality with lots of digital artifacts. Then take a look at the bottom on the 9th inning, with Boston's comeback. Suddenly the video is nice. Sharper, clearer and brighter.

What does this mean? It means that A&E/MLB decided to use different quality settings WITHIN a single game. Poor quality for the first 8.5 innings of Game 4 (to squeeze the full game onto the disc), then suddenly nice quality for those innings most likely to be watched, such as the bottom of the ninth.

I find this incredibly annoying. I feel that each game should have the same high quality throughout. If some games were too long to have consistent high quality - put the darn game on 2 discs! It is not that hard to figure out.

Aside from the inconsistent video quality within single discs, nearly all of the games are missing the Fox intro. The lone exception is World Series Game 1, where they have kept the Fox intro showing the return of the World Series to New England.

All of the other games literally start with the first batter (after hearing about the game's commercial sponsors).

I find this extremely disappointing. I think the network introduction adds some context to each game. I feel like there is something missing without seeing the opening video.

Why no games from the Angels series? Maybe there were rights issues. The Angels games were aired by ESPN. All of the ALCS and World Series games were aired by Fox. And, all of the video used for this set came from a New York Fox affiliate. Maybe it was a hassle for A&E/MLB to figure out how to do the Angels games. Who knows.

Since this box set is the only (official) way to obtain these games, we have to live with them. Well worth the price if you have no other source. However, I wish that A&E/MLB could have put a little more effort and forethought into this set. Nice set, but it could have been spectacular with the right quality and editing.",1123545600,80,2602,4.472573839662447

Irrespective of the lack of HD, Surround Sound, etc., my instantaneous immpression was that the picture resolution was perfectly acceptable, particularly given the fact that a Complete Package was actually available for this type of event for the fanatics out there. (Shades of the tremendous NASA collections of the Apollo missions...)

On further inspection -- within about a half a minute -- I noticed that although most all of the colors look good, (the green grass -- the Yankee Navy -- the colors of the walls in the parks, etc.), the Red Sox colors on the uniforms are not True. They're not even Red. They look pink -- washed out.
It's odd, in that most everything else is fairly vibrant looking.

Now I am torn over whether I will even keep this package. If I knew for certain that this will be the only release of this set, I would indeed keep it. But if it turns out that this problem is rectified in the near future, and re-released, I'll go nuts. (I hate this type of torment with a product that could be perfect, but just doesn't quite make it...)

I honestly don't expect that this will be re-issued due to spectacular sales -- or for admitted production flaws -- so I suspect that I won't pass on this package.

2293321,5,B0009IXRLW,"-Updated 8-8-2004-
As promised, I'm updating this review after I saw all the DVDS in this set. If there's one word that can describe this set-it would be ""Awesome"" You get all seven of the ALCS against the Yankees and all four world series games angaist the Cardnials-and a bonus DVD containing a bunch of goodies.

MLB spared no expense with this set. Now some are complaining that it's not in widescreen, or HD or 5.1. The majority of us don't have HD-and as for 5.1-it was not originaly broadcast in 5.1. No matter, This set is a dream come true. The way the Red sox came from behind to beat the yankees 4 times in a row is a truly remarkable feat-and for a team that had bad luck after bad luck time and time again in the past. The Red sox broke the so-called curse!

As for the World series, I would say that Game three was the defining game. The baserunning blunder that Cardnial pitcher Jeff Soupon made at 3rd base was a real shocker. He should have ran home to score a run-I think 2 runs could have been scored-but for some reason he ran back to third and was called out and Jeff soupon robbed the cardnials at least a run-maybe more. This kind of thing just doesn't happen in the majors.

I'm glad the Red sox Won the world series-Fans had enough heartbreak over the years-now it's our turn to celebrate!",1122854400,,1314,4.3117408906882595
2293322,3,B0009IXRLW,"Well, I am glad I have them, but they were not worth the price for the quality.  The specs show they are not in widescreen, but it gets worse.  It's not even in surround sound.  They don't even put the Dolby Surround encoded track on there, just plain stereo.  And even worse, on my 60-inch TV at 13 feet or so, I can clearly see digital compression artifacts all over the place.

And on at least of the DVDs, there's a ""Fox 5 NY"" logo in the bottom right of the picture.

The quality is basically about as good as if someone gave you a videotape with the commercials cut out.  The audio (with no surround sound) and video (with significant compression artifacts) quality both are worse than what I recorded off DirecTV onto my DirecTiVo at the time.

This should be Dolby Digital 5.1, anamorphic widescreen, with a very crisp picture.  Is that asking too much for something that I want to last a long time, watch over and over, and that costs this much?

To me, the Red Soxs most glorious moment came in 2004 when they won their first World Series in 86 years.

I own the 2004 World Series Collectors Edition DVD set, and I recently started watching it again. All of the gut-wrenching action from both the World Series, and especially the American League Championship Series (ALCS), is contained in this 12-disc set. Whenever I watch it, I find myself cringing as the Sox lose their first three ALCS games against the hated New York Yankees; but then I cheer as they come back to sweep the next four games (becoming the first team in any American professional sport to do so), and punch their ticket to the World Series. The '04 World Series itself is actually anticlimactic, but I still love watching my beloved Sox breeze to their somewhat unexpected four-game sweep of the National League champion St. Louis Cardinals.

Unfortunately, the 2004 World Series Collectors Edition DVD set is seriously marred by poor technical quality. Even though the Fox Network originally broadcast these games in High Definition, with its 16:9 aspect ratio, the games as recorded on these discs are compressed backwards into Standard Definition video quality with its 4:3 aspect ratio. As a result, Im treated to those hideous black bars on both sides of the video presentation on my HDTV. The video quality is very poor: fuzzy, lacking detail, and with washed out colors. I almost get the feeling Im watching these games on my old-fashioned clunker of a TV set from the 1980s

Its a shame that producers A&E/MLB opted to mangle this important and exciting playoff series in this way. I think I understand why they did, however. It was probably the only way they were able to include all eleven of these incredible games in an affordable package for consumers. I still treasure my 2004 World Series Collectors Edition, despite its many technical flaws.  Recommended.",1460937600,,2172,4.8621621621621625

8061490,5,B0009IXRLW,The description tells everything you get its all included. All the discs work there are some quality issues here and there I counted about three of them for the 12 discs which isn't too bad. The issues are very minor and didn't really bother me. The picture is not in HD but I didn't care. I have heard some people complain about the bonus features but to them I say we could have gotten nothing so just be grateful. I just wish I would have waited for the price to go down could have saved about $80 oh well. Overall I'm pleased with this set though it has some minor issues. So if that is going to bother you then I guess don't buy it. This set is a must have for any real Red Sox fan. This set shows the story of the greatest comeback and biggest collapse in sports history. I just got done watching all the games again with the bonus disc and it gives me just as much joy as the first time I saw them and that makes it all worth it.,1449014400,2,936,4.010695187165775
