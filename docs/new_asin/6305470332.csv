1039332,1,6305470332,"I had not viewed the 1937 version of AS YOU LIKE IT for many years and was appalled how poor a dvd transfer this ALPHA VIDEO is. The film appears flakey and beaten up, low contrast (blurry) with a barely audible sound track. It is a shame because this is an endearing performance of Shakespeare's masterpiece, with outstanding performances from Sir Laurence Olivier (his first Shakespeare film) and Elizabeth Bergner. The ""seven ages of man"" soliloquy is one of the greatest ever written.  J.M. Barrie, the author of PETER PAN, adapted the bard's play for the screen.  Into the waste bin this travesty goes.  I have opted to buy the HBO version (1999) and am keeping my fingers crossed (HBO typically delivers quality product and I have been delighted with their offerings in the past).",1209945600,6,786,4.807407407407408
1039333,2,6305470332,"Elisabeth Bergner as Rosalind gets top billing in this 1936 B&W film.  I love  William Shakespeare.  His mastery of language and plot is always (so far) a joy.  When I bought this, I had just seen my son as Amiens, Lord Attending Exiled Duke, and the character of Rosalind played by a very pretty, perky and sassy young actress.  After that performance, this DVD version was painful to watch and I never got through it.  Sir Laurence is good, if not entirely believable as Orlando, but the film appears to be cast as a vehicle for Elisabeth Bergner though for the life of me I can't imagine why.  Born in the Ukraine, and having first appeared in the Berlin silent film ""Der Evangelimann"" in 1923, Elisabeth Bergner acts like a silent actress, and ""As You Like It"" appears to be her first English-speaking role.  Still, as Shakespeare goes, this is a funny and thoroughly enjoyable story with several clever twists.  It's a Shakespeare play that cries out for Kenneth Branagh.",1144713600,3,976,4.694117647058824
1039334,3,6305470332,"A charming, if prudish, version of ""As You Like It."" In this adaptation, Celia is taller than Rosalind (abiding by Le Beau's lines in I, ii of the First Folio and disregarding Rosalind's line in I, iii about being ""more than common tall"" - which is cut here). Felix Ayimer is excellent as Duke Frederick but many other characters are marginalized as the script, reduced to about half its full length, focuses on Orlando and Rosalind. I miss some of the racy passages and the rants of Jacques and Touchstone that have been excised. Elisabeth Bergner's performance is affected and histrionic, but an interesting dynamic develops (whether intentionally or unintentionally) between her Ganymede and Olivier's Orlando. I suspect that Olivier's Orlando knows from the moment he meets Ganymede that he is, indeed, Rosalind. He plays it with such subtlety, though, as if the director wasn't in on the choice. Bergner's Rosalind seems to be mentally unstable, just a bit off. Olivier's Orlando is attracted to her capriciousness and exuberance. Overall, I enjoyed the film more than I enjoyed Sir Peter Hall's puzzling production (2005 at BAM) with his daughter Rebecca as Rosalind (she was the weak link in a superb cast). I viewed the film on VHS and the sound quality was awful. Maybe they improved it for the DVD.",1107043200,6,1308,4.95
1039335,3,6305470332,"""As You like It"" Should be as light and lively as the recent version of ""A Midsummer Nights Dream."" Considering the age of the film, the sets and costumes are wonderful. Crowd scenes actually have a reasonable number of people. The production is movie - not stage play.

With that in mind, too much of the play is missing. Too many lines have been deleted, some for no reason. Often, the actors stand for a long silent shot, when the director easily could have had the missing line spoke in the same time. Many of the long passages are reduced to the first and last couple of lines. This hinders the character development and the pacing. It also makes the long speeches left, stand out to much, as if the director is saying ""now wait, this part is important."" Elisabeth Bergner as ""Rosalind"" is the worst offender. Many of her lnes are skipped, the worst of it is in the epilogue. Also missing - almost completely is act five.

The film transfer is okay, the sound is lacking high end compared to modern films. This may be due to the limitations of filming at the time. What was jarring, until I got use to it, was silence. When the actors aren't talking, there is no background - no music, no foley, just quiet. Something modern films should try once in a while.

As the only film of ""As You Like It"" on DVD, it will have to do until something better comes along. At the bargin price, it is a good film to fill the slot on the Shakesphere shelf. I lay in bed after watching it, trying to figure out who should play Rosalind in a new version. . .",1097193600,33,1546,4.305841924398625
1039336,4,6305470332,"This version of ""As You Like It"" has not aged well.  The modern approach to Shakespeare, with more natural dialog and realistic costuming,  has left the tight-wearing overly theatrical players of old looking a bit foolish.  They strut around the stage with obvious gusto and verve, but they just never connect.
With that in mind, ""As You Like It"" can be fun.  The play itself is a bit silly, and the actors even sillier.  The director made no attempt to  disguise the feminine status of Elizabeth Bergener.  She remains a pretty girl in boys clothes with a screeching soprano voice.  To his credit, Olivier plays it as straight as an oak, and never for a minute doubts her ill-conceived charade.  Jacques is in full motley, making his presence in Arden forest even more absurd.
Lacking any other version on DVD, ""As You Like It"" contains a certain charm.  Just be prepared.  Your ""willful suspension of disbelief"" has never been so sorely tested.",1023148800,16,946,4.777777777777778
1039337,5,6305470332,"I have always enjoyed this movie even though the VHS version has very poor sound and picture quality.  The DVD is much improved in both areas and is worth the additional investment (don't expect digital quality though).  I love Olivier (young and handsome here) and considered him the star of this film, but the DVD keep box has about three ""pages"" of film history that set me straight.  It explains that at the time this film was produced Elizabeth Bergener was the big star and Laurence Olivier a struggling young hopeful.  Bergener insisted on him as Orlando.  Her husband was the director of this and many other of her films.  Also, I found her voice shrill, but hear it a bit differently now that I know that English is not her first language (she came to England as a fleeing Germany where she was already an international star).

1039339,4,6305470332,"This is my favorite Shakespeare play, and I've often wondered why no one has ever made another movie version in all this time. This adaption is dated  but generally well done, with an actively moving camera and some  scattered attempts at making it more than merely a ""filmed play.""  If you've seen it on TV then you probably remember the sound as awful and  the picture pretty blurry (like many public domain movies, awful prints are  everywhere). So know that this dvd is from an excellent print, with the  sound much clearer, (though still not great) and the picture 10 times  better than I have seen. So if you are wondering if this dvd is worth  getting even if only to replace your inaudible old VHS copy, then let me  assure you Arden has never looked better, nor Elisabeth Bergner's shrill  voice more effortlessly deciphered. I would not change it.",959472000,48,857,4.653333333333333
1039431,2,6305470332,"Loving Shakespeare as I do, I was so willing to give this a try and remain open-minded, but I'm sorry to say it's appallingly bad!  The least critical thing I can say is that it's boring and uncomfortable, mostly because Bergner (who plays Rosalind) and Olivier (as Orlando) have no on-screen chemistry whatsoever and it's the passion and tension between the two lovers that is the key to a successful play. There's none of that here. Olivier seems to be putting up with his silly co-star, anxious to please the producers no doubt.  Bergner seems to have been a silent-movie actress, because her gestures and facial expressions are highly exaggerated.  When she does speak, it's with a strong accent and she throws out her voice as if she is projecting from a stage to the back seats, carefully biting off each word slowly, one at a time.  Since English is her second language, one wonders if she didn't take speech lessons and her acting coach was accustomed to the theater, not the soundstage.  What a difference when Olivier speaks!  He is polished, relaxed, and his comfort with performing Shakespeare makes his lines sound natural and conversational.  The one thing positive I can say about this film is that the incredible sets are worth taking a look: a sumptuous palace with huge, ornately-furnished rooms, then a large forest, complete with a massive waterfall.  An entire flock of sheep, a herd of goats, and a barn with a cow are all brought in to make a convincing rural life seem to be taking place.  Otherwise, don't waste your time.  There are other films of this play that are much more satisfying.",1416700800,2,1614,4.752688172043011
1039432,3,6305470332,"The 1936 version has some interesting pieces of history connected with it (in many ways, more interesting than the film itself): it was the first speaking version of As You Like It filmed. It was also the first filmed Shakespearean role by Laurence Olivier, who played Orlando; and the only time that he performed Shakespeare in a theatrical release for which he wasn't nominated for an Academy Award. The director, Paul Czinner, and his wife, Elisabeth Bergner, who played Rosalind, were both Austrian Jews who had fled their native countries to escape persecution. For them, the concept of the Forest of Arden was less and idyllic pastoral setting, and more of a metaphor for escape and flight. The films treatment (or screenplay outline) was written by J.M. Barrie, the author behind Peter Pan, and the films editor was future great director David Lean (of Lawrence of Arabia fame).

As for the film itself well, its from the 30s, so its pretty stagey, and extremely edited (down to just over an hour and a half). And the editing wasn't just for time. As the Hayes Production Code was beginning strict enforcement in Hollywood, theres an interesting change in dialogue. In the play, when Celia asks Rosalind if she is upset over her father (following the wrestling match), Rosalind responds, No my childs father. Pretty risque, eh? Obviously too risque for 1936, as the line was amended to No, my fathers child... which of course, renders Celias playful use of wrestling tems in her following speech nonsensical at best.

Olivier is one handsome dude, and Bergner is winning, even with her inexplicable German accent. And her Rosalind is certainly having a blast as a man, and their scenes together are the best part of the film. Certainly better than the Jaques sections, which are pretty stiff; seemingly, the filmmakers felt this as well, as much of his storyline is cut.

At the end, the messenger who arrives to tell of Duke Fredericks conversion is not Jaques de Boys, but rather just a knight, and the melancholy Jaques, doesnt depart the camp. The Epilogue begins stagey, but is surprisingly cinematic: Rosalind begins the speech, but then her image dissolves to that of her in her Ganymede dress (as he addresses the women in the audience), then back to Rosalind (when she addresses the men, and closes the speech).

All in all, not a bad production just nothing to get too excited about. Check it out if you're a completist or want to check out a young and handsome Olivier.",1410739200,,2487,4.830985915492958

It would be hard to watch if you are an aspiring actress. Bergner is so inspired and if only Shakespeare could have seen this film himself, no doubt he would have been amazed.

1039530,4,6305470332,"This is an old 1937 black and white production and Laurence Olivier's first foray into Shakespeare on film. It was also only the second time that Shakespeare had been filmed by Hollywood, the first being A Midsummer Night's Dream, just two years earlier. Whilst Paul Czinner's production had nothing else to guide it or to measure up to, it still became a successful film for that generation. Moreover, some modern Shakespearian enthusiasts like this early work.
As the production is 75 years old one must make allowances for dated film and sound quality. Perhaps I am less fussy than most, but I was not put off by these limitations.
Olivier plays a starry eyed Orlando with great aplomb. However, his friend and sometimes arch rival, John Gielgud felt that `he overdid it a little'. Over the decades that style of acting has dated and passed on, proving Gielgud correct. Despite this, Olivier was considered very successful at the time, and is still a great performance to watch. Only nine years later Olivier made a magnificent transformation with Henry V followed by Hamlet in 1948 and became the greatest ever Shakespearian film actor.
Elisabeth Bergner gave a goodish performance, although some scholars dislike her end-piece when she talked about the duties of `vomen'. Most other actors did acceptably well in tights, strutting around England's medieval Forest of Arden surrounded by lions and sheep. Even so, the play is a rustic romp comedy where we must `suspend our disbelief' to get the best from the film.
I believe that this production of `As You Like It' has survived, despite ageing, and I prefer it to most other versions made since.

Question: Do you like the colour green?.. What a very odd question you may ask yourself, but before you press the, (ta ta) button, let assure you that there is relevance in my question, and it is this....
This (BBC Shakespeare) play of, (As You Like It), directed by, (Basil Coleman) and produced by, (Cedric Messina) is set in the most beautiful green fields, and woodland that I have ever seen on the TV screen.. It is a breath of fresh air, and quite intoxicating....
In this play the two principle characters, (Rosalind) and (Orlando) are played by, (Helen Mirren) and (Brian Stirner)... In her role the young, (Helen Mirren) handles this demanding part very well, (even if troubled by the occational flying insect).. She also plays her alter-ego part of the young man nicely as well.. In fact, I think that dressed as a boy she looks rather cute... The young, (Brian Stirner) playing, (Orlando) also carries his role very well....
This production also benefits by having a distinguished supporting cast that absolutely oozes years of thespian experience, including, (Angharad Rees), (Richard Pasco), and (James Bolan) as the convivial, (Touchstone)... All this wonderful action, and faithful dialogue takes place in the afor mentioned luscious, green countryside....
If you are not familiar with this Shakespeare comedy, this cast of accumplished players makes following the plot less demanding, especially as this product is equipped with sub-titles....
To my mind (BBC Shakespeare) is a (by-word) for tele-visual excellence, and I thoroughly recomend this product to any one....

happy viewing.... Chris Stayt",1291593600,,1694,5.186131386861314
1039533,1,6305470332,"Let me add a hearty endorsement of the reviewer who complained about Elisabeth Bergner.  Aside from the fact that her Rosalind seems a little slow in the head and one is mystified at how Orlando could possibly be swept off his feet by her, her horrible pronunciation and accent absolutely mutilates the poetry.  Nobody watches Shakespeare for the story alone.  Heck, hardly any of his stories are even original.  The most important thing about Shakespeare is, obviously, THE LANGUAGE.  Listening to Bergner speak Shakespeare is like listening to a Mozart piano concerto through a kazoo.  It is painful and at times incomprehensible.  The transformation into Ganymede is absurd, as well.  I mean, at least lose the lipstick.

While Olivier is fun as Orlando, the rest of the cast is lackluster.  Many seem to just be reciting lines.  The edits are poorly chosen, with some of them completely marring essential themes of the play (for example the interaction surrounding the famous Jaques speech is critical in setting up the play's opposition to Jaques's cynical world view, but it's all missing here and you come away thinking that the exiled Duke actually agrees with Jaques as if he's some sort of wise sage).  The directing is awful, as well.  Whose idea was it to film Rosalind & Celia racing through the woods when they first learn of Orlando being nearby?  Why can't Rosalind STOP HUGGING CELIA for more than 2 seconds at a time?  The costuming, while meant to be authentic, is actually very distracting.  It almost becomes a game of ""what kind of crazy hat will we see next""?

All in all the historical interest in seeing a very young Olivier is not enough to make this worth buying.  Maybe borrow it from the library or put it low on your NetFlix queue.  And feel free to skip past any of the scenes without Olivier.

I still can't believe Bergner headlines this movie.  She may have been great in other roles, but to put her in a Shakespeare play . . . I hope whoever the casting director was for this was fired.  He did Ms. Bergner and anyone who has had to sit through this movie a disservice.",1290729600,5,2104,4.6603260869565215

1039535,5,6305470332,"This is one of the best comedies by Shakespeare because it contains all the tragic drama at the beginning that is necessary to make the end endlessly happy. A false Duke, title-less brother of a real Duke, usurps in some way the fief and title of the real Duke, and the false Duke is thus a fake. But he banishes his rival not to be in anyway challenged in his usurpation. Then from the city, the castle, the seat of this Dukedom we move to the refuge of the banned in some Forest of Arden. They live there like more or less shepherds, with shepherds, waiting for better days. Shakespeare creates a character, Jaques, who is needed to bring to that refuge some sad wit that both reflects the situation and reflects on the situation. The second element of a good comedy by Shakespeare is the happy ending. And in this comedy Shakespeare pushes the happy ending to perfection. Four weddings presided by Juno and her envoy Hymen, four women and four men married on the same day at the same time in the same place. Nothing can be more sacred than that bringing together of the passion of Christ and his resurrection. A wedding is in a way the end and death of a life of superficial freedom to give way to a resurrection of deep emotional realization till death them parts. And Shakespeare doubles up this happy occasion with the conversion, Christian conversion mind you, of the fake Duke to the reclusion of the monk he thus becomes when on his way to a vengeance or murder he will never fulfill. And yet Jaques will then retire to the cave of the exiles because he does not have the heart to go back to civil life, waiting as he is for the seventh age of man, the one just before the lethal liberation. But Shakespeare is also a born comedian and he has to set at the very center of his fable an element that makes any moment full of double entendre and innuendo. The daughter of the banished Duke, Rosalind, who is banished in her turn, decides to live her banishment as a boy. The disguise is today obvious. It was absolutely hilarious in Shakespeare's time since then women were played by male teenagers. The double-entendre became in those days ambiguously clear. And Orlando, who is in love with Rosalind, is more or less defied by Ganymede, who is no one else but Rosalind in disguise, to practice his courting of Rosalind on him Ganymede, who is in fact Rosalind. This situation becomes a grand comedy of transvestite jest and fun. On the surface a boy courts a woman in the person of a boy who lends his person for that game. In the 16th century under the surface a boy courts a boy who is supposed to be a girl who plays the part of a boy lending himself to the game of being the girl he is supposed to be and who the other boy loves. Slightly complex, isn't it? In modern times the girl is disguised as a boy who lends her/his disguised boyhood to virtually be the girl he/she really is. Every word then becomes ambiguous in all possible ways and funny at the same time, including in the field of sexual love, especially when a shepherdess falls in love with Ganymede who is in fact Rosalind, a boy actor in the old days, a girl nowadays. The best part of the play is that it could have become a farce and Shakespeare very skillfully avoids the Commedia dell arte, and leads the comedy to some kind of moral tale about love, power, ambition, property and life. This production is enhanced by young actors and actresses and by an excellent music.

The Alpha Video film didn't even feature the Twentieth Century fanfare opening (""Da da da da - da da da da DA..."" you know it) which is included on the superior Blackhawk Films collection transfer.
The long and short is this is the best DVD of AS YOU LIKE IT on the market. Yes, you'll pay a premium for it, but I was thrilled by the quality of the film and the superb performances of Olivier and Elisabeth Bergner shine through. This was the first Olivier Shakespeare production, and from a historic perspective it demonstrates the genesis of his craft.  Elisabeth Bergner's rendition is nothing short of ethereal and can never be duplicated. If you are a fan of this age old classic do your self a favor and buy this version.  Although not perfect, I consider it to be one of Shakespeare's best film adaptations ever and, by gosh, shouldn't you be able to enjoy the play without having to be distracted by poor technical considerations? Enough said.",1214611200,6,1146,4.580487804878048

7890573,2,6305470332,"This (the Prime Video version) is a terrible copy of the film, first of all. It's so distorted that you can hardly recognize the faces. Most of the detail is lost. Each frame looks like an old photocopy of a photocopy of a black and white photo, videotaped from across the room and then enlarged for the screen. This made it difficult to appreciate the film as a cinematic specimen, which is its primary value; as a production of Shakespeare's comedy, it's only okay. See a different early talkie for your Old Hollywood fix, and then go watch a live performance of ""As You Like It"" at your local theatre. Support the arts!",1472428800,,622,4.513274336283186

7890575,2,6305470332,It is interesting to see the young Laurence Olivier in his first screen Shakespeare role and it's not a bad version of the play. But the poor print quality and Elizabeth's Bergner's thick accent (at least we have subtitles) makes it a bit of a slog.,1461024000,,249,4.434782608695652
7890576,3,6305470332,"This old movie was a vehicle for--wait for it--a German actress of the 1930's named Elizabeth Bergner.  A German actress of the 1930's starring in an English production?  There's got to be a story there.  Anyway, she delayed making this picture until her German accent was (mostly) trained out of her voice, and that delay gave us the most valuable aspect of the production:  a young Laurence Olivier in his first movie.  Most interestingly, he filmed during the day and performed Romeo on stage in the evenings!  There's a good scattering of some other future stars of Britain as well, but if you want Shakespeare in the 1930's try A Midsummer Night's Dream as directed by Max Rheinhardt.  Yes--another German in the 1930's.  It all worked out eventually.",1445817600,,756,4.8515625

7890578,4,6305470332,"I really enjoyed the majority of the cast in this version. The quality of the recording is not the best, but based on when it was made I did not really think that detail was that big of a deal. I used this to help me get through the written play for a college class, and it follows the text relatively consistently. Some lines have been removed, I am assuming that this is for the purpose of time, and the story itself is still easy to follow along with in the text. Rosalind is played by a woman in this version, and the film made an interesting choice based on this for the epilogue. Overall, decent copy, easy to follow along with if using a text copy of the play. Best of As You Like It on Amazon Prime to get a clear understanding of the plot and characters.",1424995200,,763,4.12751677852349
7890579,4,6305470332,"If you appreciate a dash of screwball comedy doyenne as Rosalind, then you're ready for this 1936 version. Laurence Olivier is, as always, an actor meant to say William Shakespeare's words as though it were regular speech pattern. This is vintage Hollywood movie magic - and serves well as a time capsule of the era's approach to classic works.",1420329600,,344,4.8474576271186445
