8574567,2,B00BVPTQEY,"I just love this man Tom Lehman and everything he stands for, and how he leads his life. Not many are as good a human beings and role models as Tom, but someone talked him into doing a crummy video that is simply the same old repeat of every golf instruction out here, and that's GRIP....STANCE, ALIGNMENT AND FOLLOW THROUGH.
SAME OLD JUNK OVER AND OVER. We get tired of spending our hard earned money for the same old speech time and time again.
I had hope this would be different. To add to my disappointment....Tom never even HITS a frigging golf ball in the entire video, much less any slow-mo or stop action or anything that would actually help us. A key item that NO ONE want's to talk about is release, and this too is totally omitted or even mentioned!!!!!!

And I don't want to hear a word about the importance of fundamentals because we've all heard that a thousand times already. If that was the answer, we'd all be scratch players.

Tom is such a beautiful human being, and I have so much respect for him that I tried hard to find a biography of his life as a way for me to become a better human being, but couldn't find it, and bought this to make me a better player at least. Instead, I got neither, and feel cheated that I got this same old lame mumbo-jumbo that we all know. Of course not many ""DO"" these things, but telling them again and again doesn't work does it, so stop charging everyone for the same old speech.
I'm a 4 handi-cap and thought I was going to get some good info here and didn't get anything but up-set.
Tom didn't write or direct this video I bet, but he should have simply said ""NO""...,go re-write this and give them something new and something good for their money.
I still love the guy, but sad that this wasn't up to ""par"" in my view.
Please don't make a video of something that can be done in a e-mail, like this video that is all talking about the same old thing again and again.",1374710400,,1922,4.248633879781421
