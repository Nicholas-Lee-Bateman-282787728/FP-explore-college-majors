3924559,5,B002G1X2WE,"Just finished this..and its a good size meal,  over 2 hours!! So many ""concert"" DVDs end up being  truncated highlight affairs so this is a breath of fresh air. It was a pretty magical night and the boys traced much of their ""Tap"" history as well as ""Mighty Wind"" era in good voice and instrumentation but more  than that in good spirit and a bassfull of  humor! Over the course of 35 chapters they cover every quality tune from their catalog and rarely falter and the film itself is sharp , well directed and the sound is jumping out at me. The venue is beautiful and there is just enough audience interaction to give the feeling of being part of this wonderful event.

I  can not recommend this strongly enough...the mix of music, humor and good cheer is such a pleasure. The BEST thing I can ever say about a concert film/DVD is that it makes me kick myself for passing on the show when it came through town and I certainly do. I've seen both Spinal Tap and the full Mighty Wind concerts (one of the few benefits of being near Los Angeles) and figured this wouldn't measure up....well I was wrong ...this DVD will be enjoyed for years!!",1251763200,21,1139,4.4
3924560,5,B002G1X2WE,"I attended the Atlanta show, it was an amazing performance. I thought it would be fun, but it ended up being one of the best concerts seen in a while. These songs are actually really good songs, and they are good musicians. Christopher Guest is a good guitarist and mandonlin player,  Harry Shearer is a good, very under-rated bassist (playing electric and stand-up bass), and Micheal Mckean is a good guitarist and singer as well. Anybody that says they aren't good musicians doesnt know anything. On this tour, they were joined onstage by Elvis Costello and Bela Fleck, at the recent Glastonbury ""wigged"" concert, Jarvis Cocker sat in, at the Wembley concert, Keith Emerson sat in. Thru the years they have had many great musicians join them onstage, including Joe Satriani and even Rob Halford, and if they are good enough to share the stage with all those guys, they are good enough for anyone, and thier musicianship comes across really well in this presentation of their music. About half the songs they played were from A Mighty Wind, the other half Spinal Tap, and theres a few other goodies too. I liked the Mighty Wind songs alot better after seeing that concert, it even made me like the Spinal Tap songs better too. You get to really hear what the Spinal Tap songs are really made of, and in some ways it's a much better presentation of the Spinal Tap material, you'll know what I mean when you buy this DVD. I was taken to a land of demons and banshees when they played Stonehenge, it was amazing, it was everything a rock and roll fantasy could be.",1251417600,6,1562,4.598566308243727
3924561,4,B002G1X2WE,"I attended the Nashville show on this tour.  Very funny and very entertaining.

They cover material from ""This is Spinal Tap"", Chris Guest's mockumentaries including ""A Mighty Wind"", and assorted other tidbits.  McKean's wife Annette O'Toole performs two songs with the group, and Harry Shearer's wife Judith Owen performs a song from ""Waiting for Guffman"" along with Guest (in character as Corky St. Clair).  The band takes a break during the set for some Q&A from the audience, and you'll laugh at some of the answers.

The guys are funny, the material is good, and the price is right.  A no-brainer.",1250726400,3,602,4.910891089108911
3924562,5,B002G1X2WE,"I was in the 3rd row for this show in Milwaukee and it was spectacular! A few of the songs were duds (Harry Shearer's parody of Elvis was the low point and the song from Waiting for Guffman was not necessary) but the Tap and Wind songs were exceptional and very entertaining!!!

I'm surprised that there is no additional material for this release and I assume most of the banter with the crowd during the Q&A will be cut out...but the songs alone are worth the price and I will definitely add this to my collection.

On a scale of 1-10, I rate the concert an 11.
I will probably rate the DVD as an 8 due to the lack of extra material (some Q&A interviews or performances from The Tonight Show, for example, would be a nice touch).",1250035200,3,730,4.244604316546763
3924573,5,B002G1X2WE,These guys have come back to give another great performance sans the long hair and hot electric guitars. They still can entertain with their sincere singing and playing.,1349308800,,169,5.071428571428571
3924574,5,B002G1X2WE,"Unwigged & Unplugged is an awesome showcase of talent from the men behind This Is Spinal Tap, A Mighty Wind, and Waiting For Guffman, among others.  Featuring acoustic versions of the songs that made these movies a pleasure.  Well worth the purchase.",1315440000,,250,4.928571428571429
3924575,5,B002G1X2WE,I am a huge Christopher Guest fan so when I hear about this tour I had to go. I was so excited to relive the night with this wonderful DVD. I highly recommend it!,1299196800,,162,3.7941176470588234
3924576,4,B002G1X2WE,"Hearing the old classics, some of wholich in a new light, mixed with comedy and crowd interaction makes this a great purchase for any fan of the Christopher Guest movies.",1286841600,3,170,4.7
3924577,5,B002G1X2WE,"I am a big fan of these guys.  I have really enjoyed their videos, ""This is Spinal Tap"", ""Waiting on Guffman"", ""A Mighty Wind"", and ""Best in Show"".  These are some truly amazing talented individuals. You can see in this video, which is recorded at one of their Unwigged and Unplugged concerts, what a cult following they have.  I felt like I had the best seat in the audience as they did all the favorite songs for everyone.  The acappella song done at the beginning and end of the DVD showcases some of their great talent. I highly recommend this DVD.  If you were not a fan before, you will become one after watching this.",1280880000,2,624,4.391304347826087
3924578,5,B002G1X2WE,I'm a big fan of all things Spinal Tap and Christopher Guest so it is great to hear the guys in this type of setting doing all of their songs unplugged. What I didn't expect was how good they sound both vocally and instrumentally. They've grown some serious chops over the years.,1270425600,4,279,4.384615384615385
3924579,5,B002G1X2WE,"I saw the show live last year and was eager to relive that epic time in all its unplugged glory. And I caught a few more subtle bits of dialog that had been drowned out by the crowd at my live viewing. Well worth watching.

And this seller got it to me quickly with no issue, it was a stellar transaction",1269648000,,304,3.9836065573770494
3924580,5,B002G1X2WE,"I've always been a fan of Tap and Mighty Wind. As a singer/songwriter myself, I admire a good song no matter what the genre. And I admire showmanship. The effortless ease and good humor with which McKean, Shearer and Guest present their songs (with worthy additions from others) make for a rich listening and viewing experience. They may have skimped on the costumes and wigs, but they are plugged in in a big way! I highly recommend this DVD to anyone. It's fun for the whole family!",1259539200,11,484,4.574712643678161
3924581,4,B002G1X2WE,"This is a great DVD.  It's not perfect, but it's close.  The music is my favorite part of each world they create and it's all lovingly re-created here.",1257292800,3,151,4.357142857142857
3924582,5,B002G1X2WE,"I have to admit, I haven't watched this DVD, BUT.....I was at the show it was filmed at. So, if you like Spinal Tap, you're going to like this DVD.  Their renditions of ""Start Me Up"" and ""Big Bottom"" were fantastic!  And amidst all the music was some great banter and storytelling from the guys.  I recommend it, it was a great show.",1253577600,4,333,4.253968253968254
8369632,5,B002G1X2WE,"We heard complaints of holes in the centers being missed in some of these DVDs!  Unfortuantely, we received one of these but once we placed a hole into the DVD we were able to have a good time.",1501459200,,193,4.078947368421052

8369634,5,B002G1X2WE,"Any fan of Spinal Tap, The Folksmen, or honestly Christopher Guest and all of his work, needs to get this DVD 
My husband and I were able to catch their show live so I am tickled pink to have the DVD to remember everything :D",1468972800,,225,4.0
8369635,5,B002G1X2WE,loved seeing the show in Chicago and am happy to watch it over... and over... and over,1444348800,,86,4.117647058823529
8369636,5,B002G1X2WE,"Hubby and I were lucky enough to see the boys perform live a few years back in Rhode Island, and this is a great souvenir of the experience as cameras weren't allowed at our venue.  These three have definite comic chemistry,and are fabulous musicians, to boot.  Their heydey may be over, but the band rocks on -- long may their twisted flag wave!",1423785600,,346,4.476190476190476
8369637,5,B002G1X2WE,I was at one of these shows and now I have a keepsake of the event.  GREAT DVD!,1420588800,,79,3.388888888888889
8369638,4,B002G1X2WE,"Just a wonderful DVD if you love Spinal Tap, A Mighty Wind, or their other projects.  Too bad they didn't do any Lenny and the Sqigtones songs.  :)",1412553600,,147,4.214285714285714
8369639,5,B002G1X2WE,"I saw these guys @ the Florida Theater in Jacksonville - they were amazing.  It was like seeing Spinal Tap, The Folksmen, Mighty Wind, etc. all in one!  Not to mention the guest appearance by Annette O'Toole.

For three guys who are actors pretending to be musicians .... they can really rock!",1399420800,,293,4.596153846153846
8369640,4,B002G1X2WE,"This was a really fun concert, and very similar to the Oakland show we attended at the Paramount Theater.

I echo all the wonderful comments about this show. Just wanted to mention for the hearing impaired viewers (like me), there's no closed captioning on this DVD.

Not a complaint; for some of us, this is important. Too many years of the amps turned up to 11, I guess.",1357776000,2,372,4.455882352941177
8369641,5,B002G1X2WE,"Excellent video & audio quality. A very entertaining & fun performance that was enhanced by the excellent guest keyboard player. The solo dancer for ""Big Bottom"" complemented the jazzy tone of that song remix.",1353369600,,209,5.176470588235294
