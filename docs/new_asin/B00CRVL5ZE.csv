5735929,5,B00CRVL5ZE,"If you love "" What is out there "" you will love this set it is awesome. I have been a huge X-Files fan since it first came out now I have all of the seasons and movies. LOVE",1381536000,4,173,3.4615384615384617
5735930,5,B00CRVL5ZE,"I got this set on the Daily Deals for $89.99, which I think is an amazing price. You get all nine seasons plus the two full length movies. Buyers should be mindful of the fact that the season's come in the ""thin"" version, so there may be some extra features that are not included. Also, the DVDs come shrink-wrapped together, so if you wanting the full box-sets you may want to purchase the ""Complete Seasons 1-9,"" but it will cost you more than double the money.",1381536000,4,463,4.395348837209302
5735931,5,B00CRVL5ZE,I have been searching for the entire collection for quite a few years.  I was glad to have purchased it at a big discount.,1381536000,,122,4.083333333333333
5735932,4,B00CRVL5ZE,"You can get series reviews everywhere. I write this to clarify what exactly this set consists of; I purchased the day of the Gold Box deal. I previously owned only three of the 'original' editions because they were SO honking expensive. The special features, on those sets, are to me not worth the extra hundred dollars, and I have not noticed any quality difference as far as this set's mastering/picture. I'm pretty sure it's the same data, just crammed into a smaller box and missing the 'bonus' disc.

This particular set did not come in a display box, as the official 'complete' release did. This is just a copy of each season and each movie packing-taped together and shrink-wrapped after the fact (each set within is still individually factory shrink-wrapped).
Don't flip out when you see seasons 1-4 are labeled fullscreen and 5-9 widescreen. They didn't gyp you; that's how they were aired and if fullscreen REALLY bugs you, wait for the rumored Blu-Ray release, because they will likely be widescreen. (The show was shot in wide from day 1, it simply wasn't aired that way because no one had widescreen TVs in 1993).

The sets are 'slimpacked' and each one has plastic 'pages' inside that two or three of the discs will snap into. They are not paper-sleeved as I have heard said of the slimline sets in the past (maybe they were when originally released?) It seems to be just fine for scratch protection and wear.

Overall, even at this current price, it's still a fair deal considering how many seasons there are and that each one is multiple discs, plus two movies, and we d not know for a fact there will BE a Blu-Ray release anytime soon. I would say,having seen both the slim and collector's editions, that it's NOT worth hunting older editions down individually for the bonus materials, though IF you find them individually for some insanely low price, go for it. Be aware, if you never saw the original box sets, you'll need a whole shelf. Some seasons, the box is three inches wide yet only houses one additional disc over these. Crazy.
When/if Blu-Ray finally appears, they will likely release everything they did with the 'collector' editions plus whatever new interviews they can drum up, PLUS all nine seasons in widescreen and with HD special effects (obviously they were originally mastered in SD). I don't need widescreen so much that I'll happily pay the several hundred dollars Blu-Ray will probably cost.
If this set goes on sale again, and you are on a budget, pick it up. There is no quality trade-off from previous releases.",1381104000,300,2555,4.762979683972912
5735933,5,B00CRVL5ZE,Its great gold box deal 89 bucks cant beat the price for the whole collection. 10 dollars a season plus the two movies for free or 8.18 for each but who wants to get tech!!! Anyways this set is not the collectors edition but so what it doesnt matter you get all the seasons with a few extras. If you want more do not get the collectors editions just wait for the blu-ray edition to release rumored to be later this year! IMO!,1380931200,,425,4.132530120481928
5735934,5,B00CRVL5ZE,"The X Files was one of those rare shows that you only see once in a lifetime. The price is really good too, and I would recommend this show to everybody!!!!! One of my most favorite tv shows of the nineties( although it scared me quite a bit when I was little)",1380844800,,260,4.019230769230769
5735935,5,B00CRVL5ZE,"The listing appears to show covers for 9 seasons plus two movies. The listing for Season 8 has the same cover here and in the individual listing for that season which contains 6 disks. So, the set probably contains 56 disks (9 seasons x 6 disks/season + 2 movies). Enjoy the collection, ""X-Files"" fans; it seems like a good deal considering that others offer the same set for over $200 on Amazon.

(FYI: I'll remove this comment after the Goldbox Deal ends because it's not really a review of the set and because my 5-star rating is not actually a quality rating. I placed my estimate here simply so people would find it while the sale is on and nobody had posted a realistic estimate regarding the number of DVDs [the listing indicates ""1"" disk].)",1380585600,35,748,4.54074074074074
5735936,4,B00CRVL5ZE,"If you know and love the x files than you know if you do or don't want this set. This set is the thinpack release and will have far fewer special features.

This is an amazon shrink wrap grouping if sets the have lying around. This is something they se to do to clear stock. One might assume from rumors that this means it is true that a new set with blu ray might be coming out. Either way this is a fantastic set at an unbeatable price.

At one time the prices for these seasons were unbelievable. In 2005 season 6 cost 150 dollars alone. If bought as a grouping today the seasons and movies together could have cost hundreds. This deal is a really fantastic price. Most of the seasons sell for 17-23 brand new.

This is a great deal. The only drawbacks are that there still isn't a blu ray release. The only other slight issue that might make you want to hold off is that prime customers can stream every episode ever for free.  The only other small disappointment is that you will have to live with a set that has reduced set if special features, especially for the early seasons.

The bottom line is that if you only care about possessing every episode ever with minimal frills then this is an unbeatable deal.",1380585600,89,1215,4.31140350877193
5735937,5,B00CRVL5ZE,"What a wonderful TV series full of suspense, mystery, action, adventure, even comedy.  All together, yes, it takes time and money, and we could criticize everyone and everything and say, ""Go to the library"" and rent this for free, but perhaps libraries don't have it.  Perhaps you're way too paranoid the government will blacklist you for checking it out.  Anyway, if you have such fond memories of this series as me as a boy, do it.  What a ride it is!  I wanted to be Fox Mulder when I was a 15-year-old Life Scout up for Eagle.  That was one of my long-range ambitions.  Spooky?  You bet!",1491350400,,591,4.457943925233645

5735941,2,B00CRVL5ZE,I really have enjoyed the impact of the X-Files over the years. Its a very thought provoking series and my 14 year old son loves it and we are progressing through each episode as time allows. I gave it 2 stars based on the DVDs rather than the content. If I were rating strictly on content it would easily be five stars. The thing I really don't appreciate is the cut in the beginning of each episode. Im not sure why it s like that and each of the DVDs we have watched thus far have been like that. Very disappointing.,1486512000,2,519,4.148514851485149

5735957,4,B00CRVL5ZE,"A series that lasts nine years has to cross many fields and terrains and meet many challenges if they are not terminating dangers or potentials. The general idea is in itself submitted to such eventualities, either Fox Mulder is menaced in  his integrity, in his life or in his FBI position and we end a season on a cliffhanger that is uncomfortable and then tricky to solve.

This very long series correspond to the strangest period in the history of the USA  and a little bit, a very little bit the world often reduced to Russia. It is the period covering Bill Clintons presidency and the first two years of George W. Bushs own presidency, hence up to the campaign against Afghanistan and Iraq, the lies in the United Nations and the perverted objectives and ambitions that have set the world upside down. The conspiracy, if conspiracy there was or might have been, could no longer be seen as coming from inside the US government, the unseen dark aisles behind and under the Pentagon and the State Department. So it had to go back to an older fear, and that was extraterrestrials, the War of the Worlds and other Martians story but on the bleak side. No Encounters of any third type. Just plain hostile and warlike.

The general idea is that some obscure committee composed of a camarilla of obscure biggies in the world came together just after the Second World War  we are of course speaking of the West as opposed to the Communist block reduced to being the USSR often called Russia or Siberia in this later period  to face a danger of a new type: the famous extraterrestrials that landed in Roswell. The general idea is that humanity as such is of extraterrestrial origin  note this forgets to answer about the origin of this intelligent life that was able to roam in the cosmos some millions or billions of years ago, making God the Creator an extraterrestrial himself  and those in 1946-47 started plans with some humans to prepare some mix of human and extraterrestrial genes to produce the people who will be needed to take over the planet again when ready, or to produce super soldiers in another shade of the tale.

This nostalgic comeback, nostalgic on the side of the extraterrestrials but also on the side of the aficionados of the war of the world and Orson Welles, is modified from time to time with the principle that an extraterrestrial virus is being spread in the world via bees, corn or whatever, after a great number of humans had been abducted to be implanted with a controlling capsule, and even by the hypothesis that it won't work anyway and it is better to plan the termination of the human race. The gist of the problem is that the  truth is out there which means it is not in us, the humans. Yet out there has many meanings. It can be out there in the cosmos with the extraterrestrials, or out there in the black, dark and inscrutable alleys and aisles of the federal government buildings where some monsters may be roaming. To make them dark plotters allied to extraterrestrials look bad all means are used: a major one is a chain smoker. The others are either obese or on the very fat side, and they have heavy non-American including British accents, etc.

The whole story then is that of a plot of some humans with extraterrestrials for these extraterrestrials to recuperate their extraterrestrial investment on earth by re-conquering earth, and these plotters use all means to control as many people in the state apparatus as possible. What is not explained is why the FBI, part of the innermost circle of power, decided to create a special department with only two agents but with great powers, to study all paranormal phenomena, and of course first of all the most paranormal if not the most abnormal phenomena having to do with extraterrestrials. It will never be clear if it was some guilt covering decision, or if it was some real anxiety of what may happen if it were true, or even if it was a way to sidetrack some agents and to satisfy the career-minded social climbing of some unscrupulous agents. Probably a little of all and many other motivations all around.

What makes the series strange and fascinating is the fact that they deal with phenomena that really look at first sight banal. It is always dealing with some strange death or unexplained disappearance and/or abduction. Instead of solving the crimes in the good CSI line, or instead of clearing the plate in the good Supernatural tradition, it always has the bias of an obscure shady plot from inside the government of the US always having to do with extraterrestrials and only paralleled to the same but a lot more obscure dealings of the Russians in Siberia. The systematic victimization of the two main agents and their substitutes in the last season is also a hallmark of the attraction of the series. Just think of all the marginal political movements that have invoked in a way or another an unredeemably bad plot from the military forces, the police, the capitalists, corporations, high-tech companies, the you-name-them-you-have-them muddy and deeply egotistic groups.

It is always such an idea that is behind all the protest groups in the world. At times it is rather realistic but in many other cases it is the sign of the paranoia or the schizophrenia of a vast number of people in our world. In older centuries that kind of ideology was covered by the street corner preachers announcing the end of the world or the apocalypse. Nowadays it is easier to mobilize at times big mass of people, at times a majority in elections or a referendum, against a supposed plot from any one establishment you may think of.

On the entertaining side this series is a perfect example of this fantasized world of politics. And you can be sure there is no truth in it all, since truth is out there so it cannot be here in the stories. All religions started the same way: the truth was over there on Mount Olympus, or on Mount Sinai, or simply in the vast cosmos where God himself, and his spirit, lived over there on the other side of the divide between life and fantasy. Nothing has changed, except the medium transporting this new religious delirium: television it is, and this medium makes it extremely entertaining though little mesmerizing, or at least not at all in any kind of religious meaning. Mulder might be a Fox, but he sure is not a Messiah, and Scully is certainly not a Holy Virgin.

Enjoy the trip.

All six or so discs per season fit in a regular sized DVD case that holds them into thier own slot. No scratching or those cheaper cloth insets. Each disc is also conveniently labeled of its episodes and nicely pictured as well. Each season is cellophaned wrapped and labeled 1-9, etc.. I like the way all six discs fit in a single DVD case. I don't like that when playing a disc, it doesn't have play all on the menu, so one has to start each new episode. So I can't put it in a bedtime and let all episodes on that disc play a marathon. I tried it in another player, and it the discs. They are not meant to keep playing. I took a star off for that reason only because definitely like to binge watch.

5736004,3,B00CRVL5ZE,"While I know The X files was a big hit with many and 9 seasons to prove it, It is not for everyone. I consider myself a strong SF fan having purchased all of the Star Trek series, Stargate SG1, and most of the super heroes videos. I had never watched an entire X-file episode before purchasing the entire series special. Thus far I have watched the first six episodes and none have grabbed hold of my interest. My rating is only 5 of ten. My guess is, X-files appeals more to those who enjoy horror films than those that enjoy good Sic-Fi.
My suggestion is you purchase only if it is on special and can waste an hour or two.",1443484800,,624,4.1652892561983474

5736008,5,B00CRVL5ZE,It is amazing to watch The X Files today I remember watching them with my mom my late mom as each episode unfolded it was a special time to watch TV. This is an excellent total package of the xfile experience at a fair price. I cannot wait for the new episodes and it was the best way to get ready for the new episodes by having the entire set to reacquaint oneself with the entire experience. The show has aged well.,1442620800,,417,4.097560975609756

5736013,1,B00CRVL5ZE,"It takes a while to watch an entire series.  Unfortunately, one of the dvd's was bad (Season 3 Disk 5).  After I found this dvd to be defective, I went through the rest of the collection to determine whether any others were bad.  This was the only one.
Unfortunately, the return policy is such that I'm out of luck -- no returns now allowed.  If I had known that I would have to buy another dvd to replace any that were defective I would not have purchased the collection.
Come on, Amazon! Don't you think you should take care of your Prime Members by replacing defective collections of dvds that could easily take a year to view once?",1442016000,4,635,4.3559322033898304

5736016,3,B00CRVL5ZE,"A few good episodes mixed in with a lot of nonsense. I can see why so many people like the series, it feeds American paranoia about the government keeping secrets about aliens, and attempts to disprove science and prove the paranormal that doesn't exist.

5736018,3,B00CRVL5ZE,"This collection does indeed contain all the episodes PLUS the two feature films released in the theater. As a ""deal"" purchase, it's a good bargain. All 9 seasons are on standard Definition DVD. There are no Blu-Rays herein. The first four seasons are all ""full screen"" while the rest are letterbox.
There is also no special box...actually, no box at all. The DVDs are all just shrink wrapped together.
Since it was purchased as a ""deal,"" I was only slightly disappointed. Had I gone the full  nine and dropped two bills, I would have been extremely disappointed.
Part of the reason fans buy entire series is not just for the content but because it comes neatly wrapped in a cool box or tin that sits on the shelf, like my Millennium, Star Trek and Tron collections.
Even at $80, I would have expected a simple box at least! Get it just shrink wrapped made me feel like I bought it from the bargain bin at the grocery store where it sat next to used copies of XXX: State of the Union, Indian Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and Transporter 2.

True collectors, will want to seek out the Boxes collections like ""The X-Files Complete Collection."" Bargain hunters will be fine with it the way it is...""at least I have the entire collection on DVD so my viewing can be on my terms and not subject to the whims of streaming contracts or internet connections.",1440979200,,1363,4.51417004048583

Those of us that followed the series,when it was airing, know
about the strange, and questionable topics the show covered.
And the fact that the Government, indeed does have ""X-Files"",
and of course ""Area 51"", makes this series, all that much darker.

Many of the discs are messed up such that you have to skip ahead chapters to get past the bad sections on the discs and end up missing most of the show. This happened on multiples discs. Some discs even the menu would not load so you couldn't skip ahead to later chapters. We did some research and many people reported the same problem. When they contacted the manufacturer, the manufacturer would not replace the discs or even when they did, the new discs had the same problem. So there was a problem with the making of the discs. Not a problem with Amazon so I don't blame them. Even if we had requested an exchange from Amazon, the new set would have had the same problem.

But! When Season 6 production shifted to California, something shifted. Chris Carter's writing seemed to suffer and/or his directing skills. Duchovny didn't seem to be into the show and his acting faltered. Anderson, Dana, well, she is as she was, altho' it appeared that she definately got more solo screen time. And, of course, when Duchovny departed and was ""replaced"" by Robert Patrick in Season 8, the X-Files were toast.

All in all, a great deal thru Amazon. Fast delivery and great price. Now, I just have to get 'The Lone Gunman' series to round it all off.",1409961600,,606,4.7075471698113205

5736125,2,B00CRVL5ZE,"Thought I would sit back and enjoy a marathon of X-Files episodes - what I got was a marathan of bad production discs.  Opened Season One, of the 24 episodes on this disc I was unable to complete watching 5 of them due to bad sector errors and glitches.  I thought, okay, open Season Two and see how that works.  The first two episodes were filled with data skips and starts, at one point the sound quit completely and then restarted out of sync with the characters mouths.  Wow - okay - let me try the X-File Movies.  Opened the first movie - ""Fight the Future.""  Same situation as with the episode Discs 1 and 2.  The first 20 minutes of the movie took almost 40 minutes to watch due to the data skips and problems.

Maybe this was just a bad production run and the package received was chock full of bad discs.  I did not even bother opening Seasons 3 thru 9, or the second movie.  Just went and ordered another set hoping it would be in better condition than this one.

The episodes I was able to watch were as creepy as I remember and were enjoyable.  Look forward to reviewing Seasons 2-9, and the movies on the new set of discs.

5736190,5,B00CRVL5ZE,"I found the show on my Prime Instant Video on my iPad one day. I watched a few episodes and knew I had to get the entire series and couldn't resist buying it.

Keep in mind this isn't a specialized collection. That is it doesn't come in a huge box like you'd find with other collections. Instead it's just seasons 1 through 9 and the two movies wrapped up into a collection. You don't get a special box that you can keep on your movie stand. That is one thing I'd like to clear out. Then again I never was a fan of boxes so just having the show is perfect.

The series is 100% complete in that you follow Mulder and Scully from season 1 through the end. I never really had any liking to Robert Patrick starring in it and really haven't started watching that part of the show yet.

I remember as a kid coming home everyday and watching XFiles among other great shows. I think I forgotten most of the shows and everytime I see it pop up, either by accident or through browsing, I have to check if there's a complete season pack for it or not. I'm very glad this is out on dvd and now I can watch it hopefully forever.

So what makes XFiles so great? Well the reason is rather interesting. The show deals with what I would like to consider two types of episodes. The majority of the episodes centers around some sort of investigation into the supernatural. Mulder is typically interested and much more believable to ufos, mass government conspiracies, super natural beings, and other things of that nature. Scully acts as the skeptic in these episodes. She is more of the audience citing scientific reasons. I think it kind of gets annoying eventually when each episode falls into this pattern where Scully is skeptical, never believing and Mulder is the only one seemingly able to piece things together. However, the show does have a nice way to make it not so annoying but in all the show centers around this theme.

The second type of episodes are generally the connecting episodes, if I can word that right. It centers around a greater plot that Mulder and Scully are in. The episodes loosely connects to one another overall in that some events Mulder and Scully take part in are brought up or connected in other episodes down the line. However, one consistent theme that generates some episodes is the greater conspiracy that Mulder and Scully are in where they fight against an unknown government cover up and they are left to solve it. These episodes sort of pan out throughout the season. One big theme is centered around Mulder and his sister who Mulder believes was abducted by aliens when they were young children. Throughout the seasons, Mulder experiences many explanations and findings about his missing sister. There is one episode that ""concludes"" it but brings up a lot more question and I don't think it really brings justice to the overall plot they were trying to show.

XFiles have many funny episodes featuring Mulder and Scully. Some of my favorites include a Cop parody where Mulder and Scully unknowingly volunteered themselves to be on the hit TV show Cops. Other funny episodes include where Mulder and Scully go undercover to be husbands and wives in some crazy gated community with a weird home owners association and rules.

The show gets into nearly every imaginable supernatural and conspiracy theories that you can think of. From basic witchcrafting all the way up to super government ufo coverups, the show really never left out anything.

Overall the show is excellent. I think the show sort of had its niche in TV shows. For me, the show has made me read some books and such about the supernatural, ufos, mass government cover up, and so on. The odd thing is that in modern times, I think xfiles would prove excellent with all the recent events that took place mainly after the show ended. I wonder what xfiles would be like if it aired today? Probably more of a documentary than a hit tv show.

My opinion is that everyone should get this dvd if you grew up in the 90s. This is probably one of the best series that ran during the 90s and I really can't imagine anyone not having this in their collection.",1388275200,4,4138,4.558546433378196

5736219,5,B00CRVL5ZE,"AN UNBELIEVABLE BUY!!
I was so upset about not having seen all the episodes of this wonderful series that I pushed my relationship with relatives almost to the brink of a family feud.  Now that I have the entire 9 seasons of the X Files at this incredible over-stock price (a Blu-ray version is right around the corner), I have told my wife that her Christmas shopping for me is complete and I can, hopefully, make amends with my beautiful niece, Caryn, and her husband, Danny.

Here's what happened: being big fans of the show themselves they bought the box set several years ago and binge-watched all of the 202 episodes they had missed when they aired.  So, I subtly hinted that I liked the show and they GAVE me the set.....or so I presumed.
When I recently saw them, they asked if I was finished ""borrowing"" the Files.  Who knew that they would have a precocious son, Orion, who was a brilliant science-guy and who now, at 5 years old, could identify all the countries of the world by shape as well as name the moons of all the planets in our solar system, argue the merits of declassifying Pluto as a planet and read & write in several languages, including, apparently, Japanese-American. (This last item spelled my doom as far as arguing successfully that the X-Files had been a gift to me).  I certainly convinced myself that I had my retirement to view this wonderful series.

As many people owning the box set know, the information written on some of the box-set's back cover touts, in Japanese-American gobbled-di-goop, that Bruce Willis was the star and gave credit for the wonderful movies in the ""series"", Die Hard 2, that are packaged inside!
That clinched it for my niece and nephew.  I guess Orion had also become really fluent in the written Japanese-American dialect as well: ""No, it was NOT a gift but a loan and can you send it back for our son to enjoy"".  How could I even hope to argue anything except whether First Class or Fed-Ex would be the preferred method of shipping.
I sent it back and prayed that Orion would also binge-watch all the shows, move on to Dr. Who or Mystery Science Theater 3000 and then quietly mail the Set back to one of his hoped-for, still-favorite uncles.

Now I don't have to worry: I'm watching the episodes in their 4 Arc order and it is glorious: 1. Abduction, 2. Black Oil, 3. Colonization and 4. Super Soldiers.  This way when I visit my young nephew we can argue the merits of which is the better way to enjoy this incredible show.

The TRUTH IS OUT THERE: My life and my family connections are once again in Harmony and Balance.
Thank you Amazon.

On the other hand, it's an FBI investigation of the suspected cover-up that there is.
