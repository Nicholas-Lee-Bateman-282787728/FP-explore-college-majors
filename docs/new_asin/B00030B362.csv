2155285,5,B00030B362,I love his type of comedy.  It fits right in with a lot of people's lives!  I must be a redneck because I live on a dirt road!  LOL!  A great video!,1359244800,,148,3.53125
2155286,4,B00030B362,"By this time of course you've pretty much heard all of the material in this program. Just remember though that this was recorded in the early '90s. In fact I was able to figure out that it was recorded before his release of the album ""You Might be a Red Neck If...."". Therefore you will see a number of jokes that are not as well known and you'll only find on the Laughing Hyena recording. So in all it's fun to see these things performed live and just see back to the early days.",1358380800,,480,4.117021276595745
2155287,5,B00030B362,"Like always Jeff makes me laugh. I know that some jokes are reiterated, but still love the way he said them",1355961600,,107,4.142857142857143
2155288,4,B00030B362,"Definitely for adults only and not the entire family due to many sexually explicit  references.  It is definitely not a 'clean'  funny DVD Jeff Foxworthy has made.  He did get me laughing, but  only in certain sections of his performance. I think Mr. Foxworthy  is so gifted that he could easily make jokes funny without all the sex.",1133308800,3,333,4.655172413793103

8035625,5,B00030B362,"I ordered this as a present for my mother who is in a retirement home.  I thought it would add some much needed laughter to the place.  I watched it before taking it over to her to make sure it was multi-crowd friendly.  I had heard most of the content before, but still found myself cracking up big time throughout.  Jeff is really hilarious and this is some of his best material.",1389830400,,381,4.25
