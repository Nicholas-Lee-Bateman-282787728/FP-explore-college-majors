8206095,4,B000SNUNXI,"I have many beading books, but this is my first beading DVD. Nice little beginners' training DVD for working with wire. There are 7 chapters plus an introduction.  Four of the chapters are on earrings. I just received this DVD today, and sampled every chapter. The chapters I watched all the through had one project per chapter. Two instructors who own a bead shop in Toronto teach a student how to make simple jewelry using beads, wire, and tools. They give some helpful tips that can be applied to wire beading in general. I think the title, ""Step by Step Beading"" is a little misleading, since they only use wire.  I was hoping to watch someone do samples of off-loom weaving stitches, so I didn't get what I wanted, but since I'm a novice with wire, I will use some of the info to my advantage, especially crimping. There was no Editor's info, and no one had reviewed it, but for $10, I took a chance. And I will use it in the future.  If you are brand new to using wire, like to see how things are done, and need some easy projects to further your skills, this is a good DVD for 10 bucks. I have not found a dirth of DVDs on beading; if anyone knows of a good one on weaving (right angle, peyote, brick stitches, etc.), I'd like to know!",1254787200,13,1242,4.276595744680851
