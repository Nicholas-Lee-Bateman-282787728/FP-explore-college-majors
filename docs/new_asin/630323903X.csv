The bad guys abduct Astrogirl hoping to use her to pressure Astroboy into surrendering the jewel they seek that he has in his chest cavity. Too bad for them she is not as helpless as she seems. Nevertheless, big brother comes to her rescue when he hears her cries for help. Astroboy is Great fun for the whole family. The humor in this and other tapes in this series is clean and innocent. This episode along with its sequel, ""Return of Queen Cleopatra"" (tape 9 of this series), are based upon Osamu Tezuka's Astroboy Manga comic ""Secret of the Egyptian Conspirators "" (see Darkhorse Comics translation of Astro Boy manga volume 9).
Episode 69: ""Funnel to the Future""
Astroboy, Asrogirl and Dr. Elephun pass through a portal to the future, only to find that mankind has become extinct. This is clearly modeled on H.G Welles (or is it 'Wells'?) ""The Time Machine"", for there are Oriads (Eloi) and Loki (Morlocks), and even the whole plot itself smacks of ""The Time Machine"". A really cute parody! Osamu Tezuka was truly the god of manga. Astroboy must help the effete Loki learn to stand up against the evil Oriads. Osamu Tezuka was fond of modeling his stories on classics.",1055980800,,1205,4.7156398104265405
