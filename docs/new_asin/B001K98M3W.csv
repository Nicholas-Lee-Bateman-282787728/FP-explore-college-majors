3663919,5,B001K98M3W,"Yay! The long awaited series has finally been fully released by Funimation!

Great episodes, as always. In terms of the extras they're pretty cool- such as the manga pages by Viz and the free mini calender!

My only complaint would probably be about the dub itself. In my opinion, it just sort of loses something translated into english. But that's just my opinion.

This box set is a great follow up to the previous one and would make a great addition to any shojo anime collection!",1231372800,7,483,4.593023255813954
3663920,3,B001K98M3W,"This show is genuinely good. The only problems I have with it is that it's SO MUCH MORE DIFFERENT THAN THE MANGA. The manga is so good. How could you taint that? And I absolutely can't stand how they redid the theme song from Japanese and the credits song into American. They sound like crap. And Haruhi's voice sounds like a man. I prefer the manga way over the anime, but I still really enjoy the anime.",1231372800,,405,4.2727272727272725
3663921,5,B001K98M3W,"This is the second, and last, set of Ouran High School Host Club, described as a reverse-harem story.  The set holds episodes 14 to 26.  There is still the humor, some of it in the form of slap-stick, but there is also a touch of drama as we learn the histories and backgrounds of the characters.  Also the last few episodes bring the threat that the club will be ending.  Oh, the horror.  Well, not really.  I just can't take the drama that seriously.  With such episodes as Kyoya's Reluctant Day Out and Chika's Down With Honey Declaration, which are the drama filled ones, how could you take any of this seriously?  It is funny, choking on your food funny, your drink coming out of your nose funny, but touching?  Maybe sometimes, but this is comedy and don't you forget it!
Extras include three commentaries, funny outtakes, a 2009 Host Club calendar, manga pages on the DVD and the normal trailers.",1245283200,,903,4.559006211180124
3663922,5,B001K98M3W,"There are things that just can't be described by any other phrase than ""well-made."" Anime for Ouran High School Host Club is definitely one of those things. The characters, the story, the artwork, the voice acting, the animation - there is no aspect of this anime that isn't on the positive side of the spectrum.

While the first part mainly focused on the comedy, the second does more so on the drama. Character developments through flashbacks and monologues/dialogues are constantly present, which set the rightful balance for the sake of pacing and mood.

Tamaki, the ""King,"" is supreme as usual.
Mamoru, who played the role of Light from ""Death Note"" and Zero/Ichiru Kiryu from ""Vampire Knight,"" is the perfect person for this role, no question/hands down.
Vic, whom I thought to be a little shaky in the first part, turned out to be, in my opinion, as good as any English voice actor could ever have played the part. I was glad to be able to watch the anime in both English and Japanese voice-overs without feeling too uncomfortable, and that says quite a lot about the cast at Funimation when an anime is not like Fullmetal, where all the names and terms are in English to begin with. So kudos to every member of the cast, not only to Vic, are in order.

Back to Tamaki himself, his sad childhood is revealed part by part with each episode and all things that have contributed to forming the club, due to his bizarre and wonderful personality, are delicately explained.

Haruhi continues to play her role as the indifferent heroine.
However, I must say, her significance only seemed to decrease as the series went on. Of course, the novelty of a fresh kind of character can only last so long from his/her introduction, but as the person that held everyone together ultimately turned out to be Tamaki, Haruhi was rather stuck being an accessory for jokes and the spontaneous and weird competitions. Her relationship with Tamaki is self-explanatory; with Kyouya, shedding light on his life-view and overall perspective on things is something that she'd already done.

the Hitachin twins, on the contrary, develop while remaining the same.
I have regarded the twins, in the first part, to be... well, bizarre... and weird... and ridiculous and such and such (if you can understand why) but they've played the center role when the second part came around. Although I'm not an identical twin myself--I doubt there is anyone out there who's as IDENTICAL as these twins are--to me, the social problems they were suffering were the most relatable. The concept of individuality loss is shown to the fullest using the isolated Kaoru and Hikaru. There are so many things to be said about them, but my not-so-competent English skills do not allow me to do so about their intricate mind-set.

I'd love to talk about Kyouya, Honey, and Mori, but I've got to finish this review short.

Any host in the club is likeable - at least one that suits your taste.

The story is hilarious and deep - I don't think I've seen a better balance in my life as long as the TV goes.

Along with the excellent original dub, the English one meets the standard in its own way.

The standard anime season length proved to be the most fitting, and the ending was great.

Fair amount of sound/graphic effects and, not that this series needed much of it, the animation was top notch. The fact that fights Mori/Honey had were better than some fights from Bleach or Naruto must be unbelievably embarrassing for them.

Truly an A+ Classic; couldn't recommend it to anyone high enough!",1244505600,,3550,4.74512987012987

3663926,5,B001K98M3W,"Ouran High School Host Club is my all time favorite anime/manga series. I am so happy it came out on DVD in the US, giving me an opportunity to purchase it to show my support. I had already seen the series in its original Japanese with English subtitles through BitTorrent, and it is fantastic. The English translation (by that, I mean the English voice over) loses something in translation. The twins calling Tamaki ""boss"" instead of ""lord"" or ""milord"" (as they do in even English translations of the manga)? Blasphemy! I suggest watching the DVDs in Japanese with English subtitles in order to get a better feel for the story, but overall, I am quite pleased with this DVD set.",1237075200,,679,4.666666666666667

However, the dubbed version left out a lot of the little things that make the original so good. Phrases were reworded that didn't need to be so you miss the settle nuances here and there.
I am a little bit disappointed but I am still happy with the purchase. This show however is much better subbed with the original voice actors.",1234137600,,498,4.252631578947368

Part two picks up where the first part left off, with Haruhi and the other host club members getting into crazy mishaps. The boxset includes episode 13-26, plus extras and trailers. The scene outtakes are very funny. The audio options include original japanese, with or without subtitles, and english (very good dub).

3663936,5,B001K98M3W,"Ouran High School Host Club has to be one of my favorite animes ever. Now, I know that it doesn't have the deepest plot ever, but the interaction between the hosts and their guests is always fun to watch. Plus, there's a character for everyone to love. There's Tamaki, the idiot king of the host club with the purest and kindest heart. Haruhi is the only girl of the club, but she can see the good in everyone and keep the other hosts on their toes. There's Kyouya, the club's vice president, who is cold on the outside, but will to what's right behind the scenes. The Hitachiin twins are mischevious, but they are finally opening up to others. Mori-senpai may look intimidating, but Honey-senpai softens his appearence with his cuteness.

The shows dub by Funimation dub was done very well, though Kyouya had to grow on me a little. They stayed true to the original script as much as they could and the hosts personalities were kept intact. The animation is beautiful and the music matches the scenes so perfectly, I just find it kinda funny that the person who composed the music for Ouran composed the music for Death Note as well. I will warn you. If you don't like overly pretty boys or corny dialoge at times, this show isn't for you. Of course, if you just want a show that you can relax and enjoy the ride, I think you should definately check out Ouran High School Host Club!!",1233187200,7,1384,4.470355731225297
3663937,4,B001K98M3W,I bought it for my 13 yr old granddaughter and she was so happy. She spent the day watching the whole dvd.,1232841600,,106,3.8636363636363638
3663938,4,B001K98M3W,"The second half of the animated version of Ouran is equally funny, but also adds a good dose of drama as we learn more about who the guys were before they met Haruhi and eachother.

Renge and Ranka return as supporting characters, as do the Zuka Club and Nekozawa as guest stars (the latter in the Halloween episode, of course); and the gang gets a new buddy in scary looking but gentle Yakuza (Japanese mafia) heir apparent Ritsu Kasanoda - for whom Christopher Sabat's dub job was absolutely hilarious and might turn out being my favorite performance of his - although I'm reserving judgement on that until I see what he gets to do with Kurogane if the Tsubasa OVA is licensed.  The main dub cast also continues to do a bang-up job, with J. Michael Tatum's Kyoya deserving special mention for an episode in which he tells Haruhi the story of how he met Tamaki, and Todd Haberkorn and Greg Ayres getting to do some complex and delicate work as the twins.

As for the story, the gang continues to create benevolent chaos trying to help various people out, but another tone enters as we learn about Tamaki's not-so-great home life; and the twins begin to struggle as volatile Hikaru tries to get a grip on the emotions that the twins' deepening friendship with Haruhi have stirred in him, while calmer, more perceptive Kaoru starts to realize that it's going to be he who has to start slowly nudging the twins apart slightly if Hikaru is going to start having healthy relationships with other people.

Finally, we have the issue faced by many manga-based anime.  Many have stumbled towards the finish line, as they end before the manga has completed and an ending which may not necessarily be in synch with what will eventually happen in the manga is crafted - often none so well.  To the question of whether Ouran suffers this fate, the answer is a resounding No.  The ending is exciting and emotionally fulfilling to the point that Bisco Hatori will have some work finishing the manga on as good a note.  This is one time when the ending was done just right.

Anyone who liked the first set of Ouran will like this just as well - and love it's characters even more.",1232236800,16,2166,4.561855670103093
3663939,5,B001K98M3W,"Not sure whether to review this set over or equal to the first set from Season One of Ouran High School Host Club. Either way if you own the first half just get this set since it is just some of the most comedic anime you will ever see.

I cannot recommend this anime enough since the comedy in it is so refreshing, like the flames of moe. There are a couple more random episodes that go into backstory of certain characters, which I am sure some fans really dig, where as others like me found them to be a little slow, but the point of the show is not to continue a detailed story; rather to show a collection of people and how they interact.

Some of the episodes bring in new characters and plots that will just have you bursting out laughing, and if you're not there is something wrong with your soul. For example when the gangster is introduced towards halfway point of disc 2, without going into spoilers, just imagine a gangster, cosplay, and questionable feelings for one of the host club members, classic.

For the dvd itself, same high production value with artwork, designs, music. I tend to watch all anime with japanese voiceovers, however having listened to some of the show with the english cast, they do a solid job but come up short in capturing the zaniness the japanese cast presents, but that may be due to aiming the dialogue more for American audience than anything else.",1231977600,,1393,4.4763779527559056

8314457,5,B001K98M3W,"Originally, I'd never had seen or heard of this series. Then, two of my good friends introduced me to it. I have watched specific episodes countless times, the series at least 15. It's shoujo, that girls will like, and even guys will like (hell, there were two who introduced me to it!) The story is as follows...

Japanese high school student, Haruhi Fujioka (spoiler!), a female, is mistaken for a guy by the school's ""Host Club"", a place where six young men entertain and woo the girls of the school- aka: ""Young men with too much time on their hands with young ladies who also have too much time on their hands"". Haruhi, spooked by the host club, breaks an expensive vase. From then on, the hilarity begins.

The Characters:

Haruhi Fujioka- A female host club member disguised as a male to pay off the eight million yen debut of an expensive vase. Haruhi tends to be deadpan towards Tamaki, as well as sarcastic. It makes her character all the more hilarious. Haruhi's mom, a lawyer, died when she was a mere 5 years old, and her dad is a transvestite (and a funny one at that!)Haruhi has multiple boarderline romantic moments with some of the host club, basically, shoujo.

Tamaki Suoh- The seemingly idiotic leader and founder of the host club. He's one of the best parts of the entire series, the main source of comedy, if you will. Tamaki tends to overreact (he's EXTREMELY melodramatic), daydream, and be mistaken for a pervert by Hikaru and Kaoru. He also is famous for hiding in what many fans like to call the ""Emo Corner"" or the ""Corner of Woe"". Tamaki also refers to himself as the ""Daddy"" of the Host Club, Kyouya being the ""Mommy"", Haruhi the ""daughter"", Hikaru and Karou ""the brothers"", and Honey and Mori ""the neighbors next door"".

Kyouya Ootori- Kyouya is a character you don't pay much attention to at first. I really didn't. He's just some random supporting character. The spectacles guy. But as the show goes on, you realize, he's the true chessmaster behind the club. He manages the club's finances, sells some of the host's things (without permission), and is very manipulative and cunning. Suprisingly, he is Tamaki's best friend. Later, you also find out that he's striving to follow his father's large expectations of him. And of course, in episode 8, there's the fanservice-y moment when you see him without his glasses (one of my favorite scenes, in fact).

Hikaru and Kaoru Hitachiin- Redheaded twins (think anime Fred and George, only a little different) who pretend to practice a homosexual, incestuous, relationship to generate revenue for the club. (sorry yaoi fangirls, they're not gay. and if you were expecting huge ""uber kawaiih"" ""gay smex"" scenes, I'm sorry to dissappoint.)They're tricksters who like making silly remarks, including staging a fake fight to attract more customers, and teasing Tamaki over some of his fantasies.

Honey- Yes, he's 18. Yes, he looks like he's in elementary school. Yes, he likes candy and sweets a little TOO much. But don't judge Honey by what he looks like on the exterior. Because the moment something happens to his precious stuffed bunny, Usa-chan, he will make sure that you get a serving of revenge. By kicking you in the ass.

Mori- Is extremely stoic. He often says only one line per episode. The most you see him speak is a little past a paragraph, or a little below that, and that's only once.

-----

I would highly suggest buying this. The sub is amazing. The dub is very well done. Vic as Tamaki is perfect, he's got the dramatic, pretty boy, host voice down pat. Kyouya's VA in the dub also did an amazing dub. His voice is deep, cool. Kyouya grew on me in the dub, more so than the other characters. Hikaru and Kaoru's dub actors made sure you could tell the twins voices apart, like the sub. And Honey, well, Honey, of course, sounds like a girl either way, radiating bubbly cuteness when he speaks. Mori's voice was perfect too, deep, stoic. Last but not least, we have Haruhi, who's voice manages to sound masculine, yet femenine at the same time.

I would also reccomend watching the outtakes as well. They made me laugh too much~!

Overall, Ouran is a good shoujo series for anyone over 12, and has appeal for adults as well as teenagers, and boys as well as girls.",1311206400,,4259,4.686746987951807
8314458,5,B001K98M3W,"I love this anime so, so, so much! Ouran High School Host Club is such a great anime! It has comedy and romance. Everything I pretty much look for in an anime! The romance in it makes me want more and more of Ouran. It's like a love triangle between Tamaki, Hiakru, and Haruhi! So cute.

Ouran has some famous voice too, like: Vic Mignogna (Edward Elric, Dark Mousy, Zero Kiryu), Todd Haberkorn (Allen Walker, Ling Yao, Deatht the Kid), Caitlyn Glass (Winry), J. Michael Tatum (Scar in Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood), Greg Ayres (Satoshi) Travis Willingham (Roy Mustang), Luci Christian (Risa Harada), Mike McFarland (Jean Havoc). Now that's what I call a great group of voice actors! Even in one episode Aaron Dismuke (Alphonse Elric, Ion Fortuna) shows up!

8314459,5,B001K98M3W,"You just can't keep Ouran High School Host Club down: no matter what, they always have some madcap antics to unleash. And ""Ouran High School Host Club: Season One, Part Two"" wraps up this deliciously manic, colorful little anime series in rare style -- a string of hilarious little episodes, and a dramatic yet upbeat ending.

When summer vacation rolls around, Haruhi is off to work in a small hotel in Karuizawa... only to have the Host Club descend on her. But this vacation isn't going to be relaxing for anyone, as the boys must grapple with a ""refreshment"" competition, Hikaru's disastrous date with Haruhi, and Kyoya being dragged out to a department store.

Among the other problems they have to deal with: a hostile newspaper club who wants to smear Tamaki's name, Hunny's angry younger brother Yasuchika, a Halloween fear trial, infiltrating St. Lobelia's academy with Haruhi's dad, a gangster's son who wants lessons on how to be less scary, and flashbacks to how the twins and Kyoya ended up befriending Tamaki.

But then Tamaki suddenly announces his engagement to a haughty French girl, the disbandment of the Club, and that he'll be leaving Japan after the school festival. Is this the end of the Host Club -- and of Tamaki and Haruhi?

It's a little disappointing that the anime couldn't follow the entire manga (which only recently ended in Japan), and it's just very saddening at the end to know that you can't see more of the Club's deranged antics. The ending is GOOD and upbeat, but it's kind of sad to say goodbye to Tamaki, Haruhi and their Club.

And along the way, you get some truly hilarious scenarios. The dialogue is frequently bizarre, the comedy ranges from word jokes (""Casanova?"" ""KASANODA!"" ""Bossa nova?"") to mass slapstick (Haruhi AND all the lesbian schoolgirls slip simultaneously), and insane things just... happen (a girl rises from the floor). But there are also some more dramatic episodes, such as when we find out what a calculating cold fish Kyoya used to be.

In fact, there's a lot of character development for the guys in this half-season. We see how Kyoya and Tamaki actually became friends (hint: Tamaki drove him insane), how the twins came out of their little shell, and some hints about why Tamaki is so fanatical about families. Additionally, there's a love triangle brewing between Tamaki, Haruhi and Hikaru.

 ""Ouran High School Host Club: Season One, Part Two"" is a thoroughly entertaining, satisfying second half to the anime, and the only big problem is that it ends.",1287964800,,2525,4.869463869463869
