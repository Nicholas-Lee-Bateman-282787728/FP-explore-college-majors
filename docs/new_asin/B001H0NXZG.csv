3622505,3,B001H0NXZG,"One of Doris Day's last movies, THE BALLAD OF JOSIE was a box office flop when it originally premiered in 1967.  A rousing western comedy, it was the closest that Day ever got to reprising her signature screen role of 'Calamity Jane'.

When her abusive husband is killed falling down a flight of stairs whilst trying to have his way with her, Josie Minick (Doris Day) decides to create a better life for herself and young son Luther (Teddy Quinn).  Owning a small parcel of land on the outskirts of town, she establishes a sheep farm...and comes under the wrath of neighbors who are all long-time cow farmers.  Josie (""a pretty girl, a sturdy girl, made of solid timber"", as the theme song goes), will need all her pluck and courage to achieve her dream...and not start an all-out Range War in the process!

It's a fun movie.  Doris Day looks lovely in her Jean Louis costumes and beautiful upswept 'top-knot' hairstyle.  If anything is wrong with the movie, it's probably just a fraction too long.  Day's co-stars include Peter Graves, George Kennedy, Audrey Christie and Andy Devine.

The DVD available from the United Kingdom offers a clean 2:35:1 anamorphic print but no extras.  Well worth importing for Day fans.",1243296000,4,1218,4.757142857142857

3622523,5,B001H0NXZG,"I really enjoyed this film.  I admit Doris Day with being such a fine actress should have been given better material to do, however her husband Marty Melcher signed her up for the film and she made the best of it.  It's not Doris Day's best film, but it's also not her worst.  It's cute and funny and related to feminism in the west.

After the accident death of Doris Day's (playing character Josie Minick) abusive husband, she is forced to give up to her son to her late husband's family.  You feel sad for Josie's character and you can see actual real tears in Doris' eyes.  She does end up getting her son back towards the end and there are some funny scenes towards the ending when she decides to raise sheep in a cattle community so she'll be able to support to herself in order to get her son back.  Plus, the men are very funny after seeing Josie wearing her jean outfit instead of a dress.

Actor Peter Graves plays Doris' love interest Jason in the film.... often referred to as ""Jas"".

The opening song is nice, however it would have been better if Doris herself sang the song.

No extra features on the DVD.  The movie immediately plays and there's no main menu screen.

Overall, a cute film.",1407801600,2,1204,4.373873873873874

3622541,5,B001H0NXZG,"I love Doris Day and had never seen this movie before so I ordered it and it came quickly. I found a good night to watch it and it was really good. Doris plays a widow of an abusive husband that is tried and found innocent of his death. Now she is faced with raising her son on her own in the old west when women did not traditionally support themselves. Of all things she chooses to become a sheep rancher in male dominated cattle territory. She's no quitter and inspires the women in town to support her against the men that want to shut her down and remind her of her ""place."" Great story and entertaining.

3622553,5,B001H0NXZG,Have waited for years for this movie to come out on DVD.  Am thrilled that it finally has.  I love Doris Day films and thought this was one of her greatest even though she didn't think so,1330646400,,187,4.027027027027027
3622554,2,B001H0NXZG,"This movie was a disappointment not because Doris Day is in it, because she is wonderful.  The acting is well done and the script moderately good.  I very much enjoyed it until the ending.  The ending really spoiled the movie.  Throughout most of the film, Doris' character stands her ground and does a good job of making us laugh.  Then, at the end of the movie, she completely does an abrupt about-face and gives in to what the men-folk in the town want.  That totally ruined the whole movie because there was no point to the other 5/6th of the movie if George Kennedy's character was going to get his way in the end.  So, the moral of this movie, if there is one, is that men always get their way and women are subordinate.  The script tried to ""justify"" this at the end when Doris says something like ""you cannot get TOO independent"", but I'm not sure what in the world that means.  It comes across very backward and silly to the viewer, and it would have been silly EVEN IN the 1960s when this was made.  I was left shocked and confused as to why the plot of the movie fell apart at the end of the movie and only a very lame excuse is given for that complete departure.

I did not understand why the ending was so ""sanitized"" or why Doris would ever agree to play in a movie who some might consider offensive.  Was it just because Marty Melcher had her on such a short leash, she felt she had to take whatever she could get?  This film is worth a look, but if you come away offended or disappointed, do not be surprised.",1318982400,2,1525,4.235294117647059
3622555,5,B001H0NXZG,Got this for my wife because she is a Doris Day fan and she loved it ! It always pays to make the wife happy. Thanks !!,1318377600,,119,3.4444444444444446
3622556,4,B001H0NXZG,"Firstly, please note that the one Amazon review that complains about DVD playback problems does not refer to this American DVD on demand release from Universal in the U.S.A. The customer who complained was referring to the British DVD version of this movie that was released in PAL format a few years earlier and will not play on American NTSC format DVD players.

This is one of Doris' last movies and while not one of her best, it does have many pleasant and enjoyable moments though the simple story is more in line with a television movie. However, the beautiful scenery in widescreen is a visual treat and Doris, always the pro, delivers with her usual gusto and girl-next-door appeal. Leading man co-star Peter Graves is another plus in this comedy-drama that is a warm reminder of days gone by. It's a sweet slice of nostalgia and worth a watch on a lazy afternoon. It's just a shame that Doris didn't get to sing in the movie -- or even vocalize on the film's theme song.",1311724800,,979,4.5625
3622557,5,B001H0NXZG,"I remember the first and only time I saw this film, when as kid I watched it in a pan and scan edited version on TV, and I remember thinking it looked like a dressed up TV movie of the week.
But as I love Doris Day, I just bought this DVD weather for nostalgia, or that this  was her last film, and there isn't any more, but I was so surprised seeing it after so many negative things have been written about it.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and thought that Doris had some really committed acting scenes, and the supporting cast was all 1st rate.  It has a sweetness that is gone with the 50's and 60's, and seeing it in it's original screen aspect ratio was a revelation, like taking a deep breath.  The location shots were really beautiful and the transfer to DVD was brilliant and the sound is great too.
I am happy to have this film in my collection.",1309564800,2,851,4.170731707317073
3622558,5,B001H0NXZG,"Now there  are only three Doris Day films not officially released by the studios in the USA.(Julie, Midnight Lace, Where Were You When The Lights Went Out) If they all get released from a vault series, I will be extremely happy. The quality of this film sure beats the quality of many of her films released by Warner Bros. It was like seeing it for the first time. I may be partial or perhaps a Doris Day fanatic but film wise or vocally she can do no wrong.. I read so many crtiisisms of this film or that film and I really am confused. All 39 of her films are wonderful and the reason being is simply because she is in them and makes all of them special. I often watch all 39 films in order and find each and every one of them very special because she always gave her all no matter what the script was like and this made each and every picture a gem. It's no secret she had very little control, if any, in choosing her scripts, so wether a script is bad or good doesn't affect my loving them and admiring the fact that only Doris could make a terrible script work thus making it a special film. I own every film and every single recording and I feel the same about her recording carreer. no matter the song, if Doris sang it that song was perfect. We will never see another lady like her. I especially love Storm Warning, The Winning Team, April in Paris,Lucky Me, Starlift, Caprice, The Ballad of Josie, Do Not Disturb, Where Were You When The Lights Went out?) Bad scripts? Bad Leading Men? Maybe-- but who cares. They all feature Doris Day doing her thing and for me, that makes them all great films.",1308182400,4,1605,4.245098039215686
3622559,4,B001H0NXZG,"While not one of the better Doris Day films, ""The Ballad of Josie"" does have a wonderful feminist streak that is refreshing.  This made-on-demand dvd is surprisingly excellent.  The anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) tranfer is crystal clear and without a single blemish on the print.  The mono sound is equally strong and clear as well.  I didn't have great hopes for the audio-video quality of this MOD dvd, but was thrilled to find how strong it was.  Fans of Doris and/or the film should be VERY satisfied. Now hopefully Universal will at last release Doris' ""Midnight Lace"" as well.",1307318400,11,583,4.908163265306122

I forgot David Hartman was in it until I watched it again because I don't remember seeing him in many movies except for ""The island at the top of the world"", a favorite disney movie of mine. I thought he was real good in both of these. Even though I am very thankful Universal put it on DVD. I am bit puzzled because I thought it would come out on an official DVD not a DVD-R. But I'll take this, its better than nothing. It played pretty good. The picture is sharp and clear.

3622564,3,B001H0NXZG,"On Mother's Day in 1968 as a 15 year old, I sat in the 1400 seat Capitol Theatre in Concord, New Hampshire watching ""The Ballad of Josie"". What I remember very clearly is that I was one of only about sixty people sitting in the theatre.
What was unusual about that? Generally a Doris Day film packed the movie house and less than two years earlier I had been one of over a thousand people howling with laughter at Miss Day's hit comedy, ""The Glass Bottom Boat"".
""The Ballad of Josie"" is not a bad movie although it might have worked better under one of it's working titles, ""Meanwhile Back at the Ranch"".
The cinematography is beautiful and expansive and the color is rich. The cast all try their best to make something out of a screenplay that is rather uninspiring at best.
Directed by Andrew McLaglen, the son of noted actor Victor McLaglen, Andrew had directed the hugely popular comedy-western ""McLintock"" starring John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara. One wishes that ""Josie"" was half as much fun. It's especially surprising that ""Josie"" was a Universal Pictures release since Universal had made more than 100 million dollars from half a dozen Doris Day successes. ""Josie"" seems as though it might have been made for the studio's burgeoning television division.
The story of a frontier widow with a young son who decides to take up the raising of sheep in cattle country is not especially original and much of the plot is telegraphed well in advance resulting in few surprises along the way.
That being said, Doris Day gives a lively and spirited performance and does not waver, despite a most unattractive wig on her head, in giving the role of Josie Minick the same consummate professionalism she lent to some of her best pictures. The comedy moments are rare but she makes the most of them and she brings spunk and fire to the part of a woman who is not going to be a mere fixture. You root for her and want her to succeed.
Miss Day and co-star Peter Graves have great on-screen chemistry. He's sexy and so is she, filling out a pair of jeans (designed by Jean Louis) that a woman half her age would envy. You genuinely like the pair and they are at all times believable, raising their scenes together or apart to something above-average.
The supporting cast is wonderful from George Kennedy to Andy Devine and even David Hartman who fifteen years later as host of ""Good Morning America"" interviewed Miss Day during a week-long segment honoring her.
If the film did not star Doris Day, you'd watch it, enjoy it for what it is and not have higher expectations. Because it stars a legendary actress and star who has and continues to dazzle and delight, you will come away slightly disappointed but never bored. Watching it today you'll be entertained but in it's time the expectation associated with a ""Doris Day film"" rendered it a failure to critics and audiences accustomed to something else.
An interesting side-note: When NBC broadcast ""The Ballad of Josie"" on their Monday Night at the Movies in the fall of 1969, it became the highest rated Doris Day film ever shown on network television with a viewing audiences exceeding 40 million.
Fans of Doris Day will be grateful for the opportunity to own her 37th motion picture and others will find it a painless and pleasant couple of hours.",1303862400,31,3293,4.669535283993115
