2738616,1,B000MQ5552,"I picked this up because across the front are the words 25 FULL LENGTH FEATURE FILMS.
After being bit by many edited versions, I now have 25 more. I will keep this in mind before I buy any more Passport Video items.
Most of these movies are the 54 minute edited for TV versions. A few are full length, but without the opening credits. A few on the last disk are full length but my old VHS tapes look better.
So if you want to be ripped off, get poor quality films that are hacked up then buy this as it fills the bill completely",1195776000,24,528,4.038095238095238
2738617,1,B000MQ5552,"I've been collecting western DVDs for quite some time.  I picked this up with great interest as it contains some real rarities like APACHE ROSE and HEARTS OF THE GOLDEN WEST.

This collection contains some of the worst multigenerational ""transfers"" I have ever seen of largely public domain material.  Many of the features are unwatchable and most of them seem to be missing their main title sequences!  For example, both APACHE ROSE and the rare BELLS OF SAN ANGELO begin AFTER the credits, as the cast sings an opening song.  The transfers, as I said, are unwatchable... you'd be far better suited to pick up the Platinum multi-feature Great American Western collections or the excellent quality 8 film DIAMOND DVD set.  For that matter, the rare and out of print HAPPY TRAILS THEATER discs feature wraparounds with Dale and Roy and pretty good transfers.  The Goodtimes Home Video versions are heavily edited for TV, averaging 45-48 minutes (edited down even from the original Hollywood Television Service TV prints from the 50s, which ran 53:30.  I'd also recommend the first five (and very rare) Happy Trails Theater DVDs, on the ""Hollywood's Attic"" label, which contained complete and restored versions of BELLS OF SAN ANGELO, SUNSET SERENADE, SONG OF UTAH, SAGA OF DEATH VALLEY and SAN FERNANDO VALLEY.  BELLS OF SAN ANGELO, in particular, is a great disc, running over 90 minutes and boasting William Witney guest hosting with Roy and Dale, lots of on-set stories and behind-the-scenes home movies of the film in production.  But to recap, avoid THE ULTIMATE ROY ROGERS COLLECTION like the plague.",1186358400,54,1605,5.022641509433963

Roy was a top box office draw for Republic Pictures...when you went to see him on the big screen, you got exactly what the marquee said...plenty of thrills, action and hard riding with a song or two thrown in for good measure...Roy was a member of several music groups named the Hollywood Hillbillies, Rocky Mountaineers, Texas Outlaws, and his own group, the International Cowboys...then came 1934 he formed a group with Bob Nolan and Tim Spencer called the 'Sons of the Pioneers'...he was known as Leonard Slye, then Dick Weston, and finally Roy Rogers...in 1937 Roy went solo and made his first starring film in ""Under Western Stars"" (1938), featuring Smiley Burnette (Gene Autry's old sidekick), Earle Dwire, Jack Rockwell, Earle Hodgins, Jack Ingram and of course Trigger the smartest horse in the movies...Roy appeared in almost 100 films...then came television with ""The Roy Rogers Show""(1951) ran on CBS television network from October 1951 through September 1964.

Hats off and thanks to Les Adams (collector/guideslines for character identification), Chuck Anderson (Webmaster: The Old Corral/B-Westerns. Com), Boyd Magers (Western Clippings), Bobby J. Copeland (author of ""Trail Talk""), Rhonda Lemons (Empire Publishing Inc), Bob Nareau (author of ""The Real Bob Steele"") and Trevor Scott (Down Under Com) as they have rekindled my interest once again for Film Noir, B-Westerns and Serials --- looking forward to more high quality releases from the vintage serial era of the '20s, '30s & '40s and B-Westerns ... order your copy now from Amazon where there are plenty of copies available on VHS, stay tuned once again for top notch action mixed with deadly adventure --- if you enjoyed this title, why not check out Passport Entertainment --- all my heroes have been cowboys!

8170786,4,B000MQ5552,"This set contains 27 Roy Rogers movies and 1 Gene Autry movie featuring Roy along with his fellow members of The Sons of the Pioneers.

 I bought this set mostly because of the claim that the movies were fully uncut and digitally restored. However, like a lot of Roy Rogers sets, this is not true concerning the uncut part. As for the digitally restored part, they probably did some restoration but I honestly can't see that much of a difference.

 Most of the movies are good to fair quality. Keep in mind that I'm comparing this to other (mostly online public domain) Roy Rogers movies that I've watched. Obviously if you were comparing them to today's standards they would be rather poor quality. A few of them (Idaho, My Pal Trigger, and Song of Arizona) have some night scenes where it can be hard to tell what's going on. I also noticed that the sound quality of Bells of San Angelo is not quite as good as compared to the other movies which have good sound quality.

There are no watermarks on any of the movies.

 Overall, considering the price, this is a pretty good set of movies to get if you don't have these titles on DVD as most of them are uncut. I just wish they hadn't put the claim of fully uncut movies on the box.

 I've listed the length of each movie below so as you can tell which ones are uncut or not.
