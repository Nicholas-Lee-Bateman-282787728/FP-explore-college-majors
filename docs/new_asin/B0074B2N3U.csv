8509707,4,B0074B2N3U,These were informative even for us adults.  Fun and informative.,1453420800,,64,5.4
8509708,5,B0074B2N3U,"Our 7 year old boy and 2 year old daughter are really enjoying these!  Our daughter asks for them regularly.  We are using this series as part of our Bible study curriculum (free) at home (Bible Road Trip by Danika Cooley).  This is one of the resources she suggests and I am very thankful we made the purchase!  Very different than Veggie Tales, although we like those too.",1353542400,,374,4.455882352941177
8509709,5,B0074B2N3U,"I can't tell everyone enough how thrilled we have been with this video series. Every episode is brilliantly produced and extremely entertaining. Most importantly, this series has caused our children to have a deep love for the Scriptures and their conversation is now FILLED with discussion of Godly concepts biblical stories. (I will also note that we are not currently in a church setting, so this has been their sole source of inspiration in this area - besides dad and mom, of course.) It really warms our hearts to see our children so enthralled with the Bible and so eager to learn more.

These videos have made providing our children spiritual nourishment EASY! (Now, if only getting them to eat their vegetables were as simple!) :-)",1348704000,,740,4.873015873015873
8509710,2,B0074B2N3U,"I don't know what I expected!! The reviews about accuracy, and my experience with Veggie Tales, hightened my expections. I truly appreciate any effort to interest little ones in the scriptures. However,.... I could not get past the first video... THE BIG BANG!!! You've got to be kidding. Darwin's theory of evolution, in my opinion, has no place in the story of creation.  It's bad enough that our kids get that in science class.  WOW! Darwin is not mentioned in the video but ""THE BIG BANG"", used twice, implies that God used that THEORY in creation, I ordered video volumes 1-6 but do not have the heart to open another volume .. Just thought you should know. The intelligence shown in creation could not have have been the result of ""The BIG BANG""!!!",1344470400,6,754,4.661654135338346
8509711,5,B0074B2N3U,"I got these videos for some road trips, intending to have the children use head phones.  However, the characters are funny and the videos  are frankly pretty hilarious listening ( I have only briefly seen the images) and keep all 3 of my children (8,7,&2 years old) captivated.  I've listened to volumes 1-6 and they seem to do a very nice job of summarizing the themes of the Bible sections covered.  They also do a nice job with providing some simple but meaningful explanaitions to some 'tough' questions that commonly arise when studying these books.",1341187200,,554,4.8
8509712,4,B0074B2N3U,I bought this series after hearing an interview with the creator of the series on Focus on the Family radio program. I am very pleased. My 7 & 9 yr old absolutely love it! It answers questions & teaches them details about the bible as they are enjoying the cartoon. Even my husband was caught up in the story line & sat down to watch. This series definitely is worth every penny spent on it.,1338854400,4,391,4.226666666666667
8509713,4,B0074B2N3U,"My son seems to remember things he learns via a story, so I thought this would be a great compliment to our bible studies. They can watch them in the car, in the RV and for a treat at home, and they are remembering so much because the stories/videos are exciting and in context. We are Veggie Tales fans for that reason, and I'm so thrilled to have this new set.",1333065600,6,362,4.112676056338028
