196288,5,1577422821,"""Final Shot"" is an inspiring, but heart-wrenching film based on the true life of the famed basketball player, Hank Gathers, whose life was, tragically shortened by unexpected health issues.  We were able to watch this well-done film with our two young daughters and enjoy (and learn from) its inspiring, but sad message.  Hank Gathers was a young, gifted athlete who, through hard work, perserverence and support, was able to achieve great success at a very young age.  He overcame great obstacles, having made his way successfully out of a ghetto-surrounded, impoverished beginning, having been raised by an honest, hard-working single mother--played by  actress Nell Carter--who only strove for the highest ideals for her beloved son.  George Kennedy plays a dedicated priest and close friend and mentor of the family, who also lends his support to Hank's phenomenal success.
  There were so many talented actors in this film.  We wondered at the begining of the film, when the younger Hank Gathers and his fellow basketball players were being shown,  what was the name of the handsome young actor who played No. 50 and names of any of his other films?",1400457600,2,1154,5.063492063492063
