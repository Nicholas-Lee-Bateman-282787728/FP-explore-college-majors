7816421,5,6301899946,"Inspiration to study the life of Nelson Mandela was a direct result of watching this video provided in my local library.  I cried tears through the whole thing and was quite amazed at Mr. Mandela's responses and his keen ability to stay on target!  He was quite witty and very capable of handling the opposition that managed to express themselves,rather arrogantly I might add, in the questioning period of the video.  Excellent video!!",973296000,,436,4.945205479452055
