8492994,5,B0064WDXTI,"Have only done the bike part of this workout,  and its quite easy, but it sure gets me sweating and is a good Hiit type of workout.",1399507200,,131,3.8518518518518516
8492995,4,B0064WDXTI,"I love Mindy's cycling videos and this is a great hybrid.  Makes me work harder than anything else out there,
 and I burn more calories than P90X plyoX (with 10 min less time) or any Jillian Michaels video  - and I love those workouts.  Super hard workout, good total body focus, and getting on and off the bike keeps it interesting.  Hoping Mindy comes out with more!",1367625600,2,368,4.432835820895522
8492996,3,B0064WDXTI,"I've been doing Tabata workouts for approx. 8 months now and was excited to find a new one on the market.  This one will definitely make you work and sweat but..

Pros: - gets the heart pumping and the legs burning
  - instructor is upbeat(but not annoying) w/ good cueing

Cons: - rather boring, can't imagine doing it more than once
  a week
  - very little upper body work, not full body as claims

Bottom line, I would strongly recommend Supreme 90 days Tabata workout over this one, but still better than Amy Dixon's. I'll continue using it on occasion until something better comes along.",1326326400,3,593,4.561904761904762
