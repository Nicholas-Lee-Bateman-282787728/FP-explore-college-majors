8711395,3,B00VV4BXCS,"If you are a collector of 1950s SciFi ""B"" movies then you'll want to own Destination Space. If you're not, and just mildly curious, then watch George Pal's Conquest of Space instead. All the special effects scenes (complete with their accompanying music) that are featured in Destination Space were lifted from Pal's big-budget Technicolor movie -- even the space suits and a few of the set pieces used. Paramount Pictures felt they could recoup some of the money they'd lost on that flick by making Destination Space, a short pilot film for a proposed TV series. The space race was just beginning in the U.S. and there was huge interest in rockets and moon shots. CBS, however, passed on the series and instead went with a show called Men Into Space. But the failed pilot has a few things to offer the collector beyond recycled special effects originally shot in color but reused In black and white. First off, the film tries to realistically depict the actual political and budgetary problems facing the space program. Concerning this aspect of the film, there's a great deal of slow-moving talk, arguments, and more talk. But if you choose to pay attention, there's a great speech in defense of space exploration, delivered by the film's star, Harry Towne, to a Senate subcommittee. Harry Towne, by the way, appeared in numerous SF and horror shows throughout the 60s, including Thriller and Twilight Zone. His acting in Destination Space is fine indeed, but he's upstaged by the great character actor Cecil Kellaway. Charles Aidman (who narrated the 80s reboot of Twilight Zone) is also on hand as a rocket jockey, along with several other fine character actors many will recognize. And they all do a good job here, but again, things drag for the first 75% of the approximately 55 minute film. Towards the end the viewer's patience is finally rewarded with a modicum of suspense that works well even by today's standards. There's a couple plot threads left hanging at the end, and it would have been interesting to see how the show might have resolved them. Oh well.
The Alpha Video edition offers an adequate transfer. Not great, but far better than most public domain offerings. The image isn't as crisp as most of us are used to, but it's easy to watch (no washouts, abrupt film splices or scenes that jitter) -- and the sound is excellent. No subtitles on this budget DVD, and no extras except a totally forgettable 2nd feature called The Yesterday Machine: bad dialogue, no special effects, padded scenes, and acting (if you can call it that) from people who mouth their lines like robots. This movie is just plain bad, but not in a ""so bad it's good"" way. It's just bad filmmaking with not much to offer. There's one scene that drags on for about 5 minutes while the ""mad scientist"" explains -- but not very well -- his theory of the space-time continuum. The character he's talking to in the movie actually looks like his eyes are glazing over. I frequently used the fast-forward while watching this clunker, stopping wherever I thought things were about to get interesting, or amusing. Nope. Nada. I finished this ""extra"" in about 5 minutes.
If you want a decent copy of Destination Space, though, you won't go wrong with this inexpensive Alpha Video edition.",1466380800,3,3271,4.791150442477876
