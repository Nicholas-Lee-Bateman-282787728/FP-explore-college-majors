8060176,5,B0009G3BVK,"This is one DELIRIOUS/POETIC/INTENSE movie. Richard Lynch is in it, so there's that. It ranked a chapter (!) in Stephen Thrower's epic ""Nightmare USA"" book, and coupled with the allure of discomfort Mr. Lynch always brings to his screen performances, that made it a must-see for me.

I was not disappointed in the least, and in fact, I was delighted in the most.

Full of subtle nuances (the poetic), there is an abrupt appearance (for instance) of a child's pet turtle that brought me to tears (it does not get hurt thank goodness, but the segment just reflected ""innocence in turmoil"" during a particularily emotionally-charged scene in a way I hadn't expected).

This also stars Sharon Farrell and Jeff Corey who both bring additional substance to the suspenseful plot.

Overall, this film also has a number of psychologically grueling sequences and won't be for all audiences, but those who like odd seventies cinema that slipped through the cracks may find a poor person's treasure here like I did.",1519603200,,1003,4.9523809523809526

8060178,2,B0009G3BVK,The best thing about this movie was the title.  We have watched movies for years and years and are not picky.  But this one was flat and too hard to try to watch,1372550400,3,161,3.8484848484848486
8060179,3,B0009G3BVK,"I saw this film when it first aired back in the old days.  When I saw that Mr. Lynch died, I had to revist and find out the  name of the flick. I must say that if you are NOT afraid of clowns you will be after you see this movie.  He was so scary and gross--I thought that was make up but I find out today that he was actually scarred after setting himself on fire during an LSD trip in the 60's.  I only give it three stars because it was so repulsive to me.  He was like a extra twisted pedophile (all pedophiles are twisted but he took it to a really slimy sleazy level--nothing charismatic or friendly about him! Not a seemingly friendly Gacy type or a handsome Ted Bundy, and before you say Bundy was not a pedophile, he raped and killed a pre-teen!) But I digress, that is the way it seemed to me, rather it was intentional or not. So it grossed me out.  BUT the film was very suspenseful and as I recall well acted (I could never watch it again)and probably someone who has a stronger constitution  could watch it and even enjoy it to the degree that such films are enjoyable.",1340236800,5,1083,4.104265402843602
8060180,4,B0009G3BVK,"Psychic phenomena and ESP was all the rage in the mid-70's, and became a plot-point of many forgettable thrillers and TV shows before it wore out it's welcome. The Premonition is definitely one of the better of the bunch, and might have been totally forgotten were it not for the handful of us that remember fondly from it's ""Late Show"" airings.

Director, Robert Allen Schnitzer orchestrated a highly atmospheric and offbeat little horror-oddity, on a meager budget, and amidst some decidedly no-frills locations. Though a little rough around the edges at times, The Premonition delivers the same eerie, sustained mood of a film like ""Don't Look Now"", but with a fraction of the resources. I think most fans of obscure, 70's horror with a somewhat ""artistic"" flair will find this one pretty enjoyable.

This Media Blasters DVD looks and sounds good; or I should say about as good as low-budget 70's film that was probably shot on fast, grainy film stock is going to look.  It's also probably the only release this film is going to see, so if it intrigues you at all, I'd snap it up before it goes out of print.",1154131200,13,1111,4.716494845360825
