Whether you agree with his conclusions or not, Ehrlich is indisputably a top-notch scholar who has conducted his work with rigor and careful attention to detail.

8296480,1,B001E52V9I,"The Green Movement is being herded like cattle and sheep. Guided blindly and controlled by a new, new ""TERROR"". As science has become a new religion with new priests wearing coats of white.

""So long as the rulers are comfortable, what reason have they to improve the lot of their serfs?""- [3rd Earl] Lord Bertrand Russell, 1952 (p61) ""The Impact of Science on Society"" on how 'the scientific technique' is used on the world's populations then, now and in the future. Dr. Ehrlich's views are those of apathy v. empathy,  degradation and demoralization v. natural moral rightness. He and his books also promotes a philosophy of public dis-approval v. public approval. Hence the 'Scientific Technique'. In his guidance and/or partnership with the RIIA's and The Club of Rome's eugenics agenda based ideologies that establish themselves as 'World Policy and Law' through the UN.

This DVD is the visually grandiose and sublime aspect of the book. That is a must read in only that people must know who the author is and what his views are Dr. Erhlich's quotes from his mentor, Charles Darwin in his books. A progenitor of eugenics thought through Darwinism and Malthusian beliefs. He also quotes indirectly, Charles Galton Darwin, (The Next Million Years). The grandson of Charles Darwin and close relative of Francis Galton, an admitted racist and eugenicist. Close friends of the Famous Huxley Family including Julian Huxley, a evolutionist and trans-humanist himself and the first Director-General of UNESCO and writer of ""The Crowded World"" calling for a ""World Population Policy"".

In the beginning of Dr. Erhlich's interview on NPR, The Diane Rehm Show 7-24-08.

He proudly professes that he was sorrowfully wrong and disgruntled in predicting that more poor, hungry and sick people had not died from the Mid-1970's until now. Whilst being wrong he happily admits that HIV/AIDS and other resistant disease were however discovered. He praises his belief in a World Wide Communistic China solution to all our problems. This man is an American, Right?.
His foundation backed opinions are very frightening! His theories and suggestion follow the mainstream thought of global warming as being caused by man but never mentioning that amongst the main causes. Which I believe are cyclical and effected by the greediness of the world's richest individuals and sometimes purposefully as the weather can be controlled effectively and efficiently in today's world by many nation's but its this looming concocted notion and concept that the blame and cause is the ordinary person.

These ordinary persons would have been more than willing to use alternative methods of energy production long ago. Which have been around for many decades but oil is their favorite flavor. It's revenues generate bloodshed, war, power and ultimate control and possibly in the end the destiny of mankind itself. The overtone this book and his previous book ""The Population Bomb"" will give a glimpse into the mind of those whom say they would rather save a tree or cat than a human soul.

Educated Mankind has become too many, too fast, too soon for the wealthy's comfort. Larger numbers of ordinary individuals are becoming more aware that our predicament is anything but happenstance and natural. A chain of events beyond our control. Which when very carefully researched provides evidence to the contrary. That is that we have been, for quite a while, a long while, very insidiously and intentionally guided towards this idea of accepting population reduction.

The rich and wealthy of the world have the largest families but you will be told to believe differently. It's the poor! You know those who can barely afford food and shelter than arriving to the point of owning a car and filling it with petroleum. The Elitist plan is to rid themselves of those no longer needed. A working population that has out lived their purpose and usefulness.

Remember, we are now post-industrial. A service economy. Production in this nation alone was willing sent to China. There is but one place to go and that is tyranny to control a wiser much knowledgeable nation and world.

Read, but read objectively with an opened mind and be aware. Be very aware of his kind and their plans for YOU. Then ask yourself who funded this book and dvd project.
*** I highly suggest reading ""Foundations: Their Power and Influence"" and going to the UN's website to read and download ""AGENDA 21"" as the UN controls World Policy but its members are not elected by any citizens or the people of the Nation States Members and never will be.",1218758400,11,4582,5.0171052631578945
