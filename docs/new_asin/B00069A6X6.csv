8040514,5,B00069A6X6,"Best slice-of-life heart breaker combined with space monsters. Long episodes allow the plot to develop nicely. Lots of Hokkaido scenery porn along with how to cover up a menace to all the world. Lots of mood whiplash but it's well worth it. Rated 7+ as it lacks naughty tentacles, fan service or suggestive dialogue.",1524873600,,316,4.87037037037037
8040515,5,B00069A6X6,"The boxset is in great condition. This anime is underrated and I'm
so happy to own a better and complete copy of the full series.",1407196800,,129,4.2
8040516,4,B00069A6X6,"I have to agree with others here...

This is a true anime gem.

The relationship that is built in this story is truly remarkable.

The end is powerful and satisfying!

I find it hard to believe anyone could watch this and not be compelled to tell others about it...

I will warn though:
I didn't give it 5 stars because of the action. It is fairly canned and is purely to drive the story forward... (This isn't a bad thing) however the monsters remind me of watching old Godzilla movies (Not bad, just not the highest production quality by todays standards.)

The relationship with the two ""sisters"" will capture you and completely rip your heart out too... needless to say you will enjoy this. But I think too, you will be moved by it.",1207440000,,736,4.455223880597015
8040517,4,B00069A6X6,"Figure 17 is a bit unusual, and has not received much hype, so you may not know what to expect. Rest assured, this is a fine show, though it's not for everyone.

The core of the show is little girl Tsubasa's relationship with her new ""twin"", an alien fighting module which has somehow adopted her form. This strange situation gradually brings Tsubasa out of her shell, as she learns to trust herself in combat (with compulsory alien menaces), and starts to make friends at her new school. The setting is rural Hokkaido, and the slow pace and natural setting, and emphasis on emotional growth, give the show a character much like Miyazaki's less action-packed films.

The 45 minute length of the episodes means the show has a different kind of pacing from most anime series. There were a couple of episodes in the first half where I felt my attention wander, but generally the show maintains interest, and the format means sub-stories get a little longer to develop. Unlike a previous reviewer, I thought the colour was fine, especially in the nature scenes, although combat sequences seemed deliberately restrained visually. The music isn't memorable, but is well done and appropriate. I don't remember how the OP/ED went, but I know I enjoyed them!

So if you think you'd enjoy an anime with longer-than-usual episodes, and an unusual mix of Ghibli-esque emotion and occasional combat with alien monsters, give Figure 17 a chance to delight you.",1203552000,,1446,4.893877551020408
8040518,5,B00069A6X6,"Figure 17 is about a girl from Tokyo who moved to Japan from Hokkaido.  She left her friends and everything that she knew behind for her father to fulfill his dream.  In the first episode Tsubasa encounters an alien from space who is in a battle against a 'Magyua', who is trying to destroy him and his ship before he crash-lands on earth, in Hokkaido.

Figure 17 shows the development of a young girl, and find who she is.  She becomes a more confident person and more apt to deal with people.

On a personal note, I found this to be one of the most moving and stirring animes I have ever watched.  It has small periods of combat; enough to keep you in it.  Along with it's bloodless violence, it has a good story line.  The episodes are long and at times feel a bit drawn out.  They draw you in close to the characters so that you almost feel them emotionally.",1154044800,6,862,4.2392638036809815
8040519,5,B00069A6X6,"Based on the premise alone, I passed over the show for a year or more. Based on some trusted recommendations, I gave it a try and found the work to be sincere. Takahashi N. (Chief Director) and Yonemura S. (Screenplay) were alumni from Berserk and bring the same focus on character conflict and human development that they successfully used in Berserk. This crew spent time and effort creating Tsubasa and Hikaru and letting them grow up in fits and starts.

The 1 hour format also lends itself to deeper story telling. Despite the trailers, Figure 17 is no cheesy creature-feature of the week; it isa story of growing up with an SF component. Expect thoughtful writing & pacing from Figure 17, not alien stomping action.

The animation features beautiful renditions of rural Hokkaido. I thought that the ending and opening song were good. Overall, the production was excellent.

Figure 17 was an unexpected diamond in the rough.",1141776000,6,929,4.904458598726115
8040520,5,B00069A6X6,"This is such a beautiful show it's hard to express it in words. The relationship between Tsubasa and Hikaru is the most moving friendship I have ever seen in an anime. Figure17 is very character centered, and the pacing is fairly slow compared to other shows. The series takes its time slowly fleshing out the main characters. The show is as ""human"" as it gets, and very down to earth despite the sci-fi element. Figure17 isn't stylish at all, and at times can seem very bland. This certainly isn't a show everybody will enjoy. Either you'll like it or hate it. The character designs are very cute despite being a serious show and the colors are very dull. The soundtrack is nothing to rave about either. No wonder it's relatively unknown and underrated among anime fans! Where this show shines is through the well developed characters and their interactions. This is not a happy show in the conventional sense. Neither is it completely depressing although at times it is very very SAD. If you want to see how deeply emotional a friendship can run, watch this show. This is one show that has left an everlasting impression on me, and certainly one I will visit again.",1134864000,10,1167,4.669902912621359
8040521,5,B00069A6X6,"Moving away from Tokyo and to a much less populated area, the young quiet girl Tsubasa must cope with making new friends. That's when an alien spaceship crash lands in her backyard. With aid from a living armour called a ribers, Tsubasa transforms into a bioandroid named Figure 17 and defeats the alien creature that caused the ship to crash here. The pilot, D.D. (as best as it can be pronounced by humans) thanks the girl and explains that several more of these creatures have escaped his transport ship and now reside across Japan.",1130976000,,535,4.702127659574468
