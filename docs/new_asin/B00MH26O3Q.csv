8672196,4,B00MH26O3Q,I really enjoyed the movie with Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine was actually a story that was written by Debbie Reynold's daughter and it was her story and Shirley MacLaine plays Debbie Reynolds and Meryl Streep plays her daughter it was good. Punchline is always excellent it was a good movie Sally Fields and Tom Hanks are in it which is interesting that the later on they played mother and son in Forrest Gump they were really good together and the movie was a good movie and it really was emotional  there's an impact in this movie.,1484611200,,538,4.546391752577319
