7559256,5,B018WQBNSQ,I am so glad to finally own the entire show on DVD!! A funny show from my childhood!,1461196800,,84,3.7222222222222223
7559257,5,B018WQBNSQ,The product is excellent with dvd picture and sound quality. I enjoyed it.,1460160000,5,74,4.769230769230769
7559258,5,B018WQBNSQ,"Unlike a few other sitcoms, always a good laugh each time.",1458950400,4,58,4.363636363636363
7559259,5,B018WQBNSQ,"To describe how thrilled I am to finally have all of the seasons of THE NANNY is beyond words.  My son & I use many of The Nanny phrases in our everyday life; One phrase that I particularly adore is:  when someone tells me;  hey, you are not laughing;  I very quietly respond:  I am too, laughing. on the inside..; where its dry.  (Season 1; Episode 10:  A Plot for Nanny)

And, how fun it is to find the bloopers in the shows:  remember the cans of food that Fran won on Jeopardy?  (Season 3, ep: 2: Franny and the Professor).  In one moment the stack is NOT even, however, when she finally counts them in front of Maxwell, the stack IS even.

OK one more, mostly because I am thrilled to be the first person to review The Final Season on Amazon.  Season 5; Episode 11:  Rash to Judgment: Fran is at the hospital, getting her shot for her allergic reaction  for her terrible itching and rashes over her body,  In one scene Frans dress is simple and black;  in another scene her black dress has fancy sequence beading on the top portion.

Thank you EVERYONE for making all the seasons of The Nanny available.  And, Fran, if you are reading this, please never forget how much your Fans STILL love you.  I own every single movie that you have made.  I wish you happiness and good health.  Congratulations on your marriage to Mr. Ayyadurai.",1458777600,8,1337,4.349593495934959

7559284,5,B018WQBNSQ,"My wife finds her TV voice extremely grating, impossible to stand, but it apparently sets off some primal unevolved nerve endings in an unappreciated  part of my elderly body, maybe somewhere in my shrunken little brain or lower spinal cord, where knee-jerk autonomic reactions are triggered in a pathetic failing attempt to continue the undeserving human race.  Where for art thou Fran?  What is this?  That widow's peak and those eyes, and all the sexy costumes changes that indicate an income miles above the salary of any real nanny?  And an atomic daughter?  Wonderful butler?  No telling people's bad taste?  These are not questions for polite discussion.  I just love watching her and all of  them.  This is Entertainment with a big....  Sorry, Mom.  Your little boy IS going blind, just like you said he would if he watched such silly sitcoms and continued to play with his little.... remote.",1472947200,5,900,4.92

8743251,4,B018WQBNSQ,"The fashionably faultless Fran Drescher is back to bring the whole schmear to a close in this 6th and Final Season of this sitcom that ran on CBS, from 1993-99.
In addition to this 1998-99 Season, Fran finally marries the dashing British Broadway producer Maxwell Sheffield (Charles Shaughnessy), the former Miss Fine is a nanny no longer! But just as soon as Fran and Maxwell settle into marital bliss, they each announce a big production that will change the lives of the Sheffield family forever.

THE NANNY regulars co-stars Daniel Davis, Lauren Lane, Nicholle Tom, Benjamin Salisbury, and Madeline Zima join Drescher and Shaughnessy for this one last ride off into the sunset. Complete your Nanny-riffic collection with this hilarious Final Season collection which offers all 21 hilarious episodes, including the hour-long series finale that ended THE NANNY's 6-year run on CBS.",1502668800,,883,5.21830985915493
