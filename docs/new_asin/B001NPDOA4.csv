3721987,5,B001NPDOA4,"I started watching this show on Cartoon Network late in the season and became hooked. Couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD. Looked at buying it directly fron CN but the cost was more. Had it in my mailbox the day it was released! Awesome show, laughing my way through the episodes.",1252368000,3,284,4.277777777777778
3721988,4,B001NPDOA4,"I started watching this when I went home for the holidays.  My younger brother would watch it, so I really had no choice.  Suprise, Suprise, it turned out to be pretty decent.  The stereotypes of the characters combine nicely with the spoofing of reality shows in order to give you a good laugh at reality's expense.

A little to mature for really young children, I'd say keep it for the 10+ crowd.  And by plus, I mean waaaaaaaaaay plus.  I'm in my twenty's and still get a kick out of it.

All around, it's one of the best things CN has offered us lately",1252195200,2,556,4.288461538461538
3721989,4,B001NPDOA4,"What we have here is a classic example of censorship gone wrong. The damage is minimal, but still noticeable. CN does a good job with certain dubbed words but sometimes jokes fall flat if tampered with. Don't get me wrong this is still a excellent show. Original, funny, and delivered very well. The DVD box set is nice for a great price. But at this price we would expect it to be uncut and left alone with it's original dialogue. This is the only problem I had with the DVD. If it weren't for that, then this would be a 5 out of 5 dvd. Cartoon Network should realize nobody likes dubs, especially bad dubs.",1251158400,17,608,4.2956521739130435
3721990,4,B001NPDOA4,"I know what you're thinking.  An ANIMATED reality series ?!  Sure it sounds impossible, but it seems that it CAN be done.  ""Total Drama Island"" has become an instant hit when it first appeared last summer on Cartoon Network.  And since then, everyone has shared the drama this show had to offer.  Your charismatic - albeit egotistical - host Chris MacLean takes you deep into the Canadian wilderness and into a decrepit summer camp where 2 teams of teens must survive all the elements as well as each other in order to win the $100,000 cash prize.

The show starts with 22 assorted - if not stereotypical - teenagers such as nerdy Harold, surfer babe Bridgette, airheaded Lindsay, nonathletic Tyler, party boy Geoff, sly fox Heather, dorkface Cody, goth girl Gwen, crazy girl Izzy, uber-handsome Justin, the BFF's Katie and Sadie, and of course the obese Owen just to name a few.  No matter who you're rootin' for, these kids always try their hardest despite how tough or how ridiculous each challenge may be.  There can only be one winner and all the losers must stroll down the Dock of Shame regardless.

The frenetic four-disc set has all 26 episodes plus the special episode ""TDI Rundown"" which is a recap of all the episodes to date featuring never-before-seen audition tapes as seen on Cartoon Network Video online.  The special feature on this set is called ""Cast Interviews"", but it's really more audition tapes not shown on the Rundown special.  Personally, I thought they added the hour-long reunion episode ""Total Drama Drama Drama Drama Island"" where the original cast is on a mad dash for a million big ones !  But they didn't.

And if you think the laughs, the insanity, and the drama of this complete season is over, think again !  Currently playing on Cartoon Network, is the ""Second"" season of the show ""Total Drama Action"" where 14 (or is it 15 ?) of your fave contestants head toward an abandoned movie lot in Toronto for even more cool challenges that are more grueling than ever.  Don't miss the drama every Thursday night on ""Har Har Tharsdays"".  Also, from the dudes and dudettes that brought you ""Total Drama"", come two other shows on Thursday nights.  One is called ""6teen"" which is a series of, well, 6 teens balancing out their workforce and their social lives in the mall they hang out in.  The other, ""Stoked"", is like ""6teen"" but it takes place at a swanky beach hotel.

Also, assumingly, due to the success of ""Total Drama"", Cartoon Network has released a block of ACTUAL reality shows called ""CN Real"".  There are shows like ""Survive This"" (8 kids, one survival challenge, no way out until one says so), ""Destroy Build Destroy"" (somewhat self explanatory), ""The Othersiders"" (a teen version of Travel Channel's ""Ghost Trackers""), and ""Brainrush"" (kids answer trivia on roller coasters for big bucks).  They're cool, but it's totally deteriorating the namesake of this great channel they're aired on.

So, keep watching Cartoon Network for new episodes and maybe some new shows and movies coming soon !  And keep tuning in for more ""Total Drama Action"" on ""Har Har Tharsdays"" !",1250726400,2,3108,4.8007518796992485
3721991,5,B001NPDOA4,"Total Drama island is hands down the best show on Cartoon Network. Its a show about 22 campers who are at this camp and must compete in these challenges and the winner of the show wins $100,000. This set contains 27 sweet episodes to watch over and over again. At one point in May I thought they would release the show in voulumes of 4 or 5 episodes each just like Chowder,Flapjack, and Ben 10 Alien Force but when I heard that they would release the whole series. if you like this show watch Total Drama Action.

3721992,3,B001NPDOA4,"Ok so I am a cartoon geek, so I may like this stuff too much. But I also grew up in the 90s (I'm 21 now), the age of such classics as Tiny Toons, Batman, Rocko, Ren and stimpy, Dexter's Lab, etc. Don't forget Looney Tunes repeats.

These were shows that genuinely worked for kids and older audiences, which in the realm of animation is very rare. So while I may be a little biased towards 90s stuff, I haven't found a show that was quite up to snuff in this past decade. The rare exception is Total Drama Island.

Initially skeptical (the producers' forerunning show 6teen was HOPELESSLY generic), I warmed up to it via Cartoon Network repeats and found it surprisingly accessible and entertaining. It basically follows the exploits of various teens competing for cash money while stuck for a god forsaken summer camp in rural Northern Ontario. The basic setup lampoons Survivor with a little bit of Fear Factor mixed in there. The reality show spoofery is used to great effect. With general genre satire, cartoon slapstick, wacky yet charming  character anctics and a little bit of rude humor, the writing provides a good variety of gags and jokes.

Then there are the (purposely) sterotypical characters Jock, Hipster, 'Sista"", Valley Girl (or the Canadian variant) Dork, Goth and Delinquent, just to name a few. There were even some outside of those parameters, (such as off kilter wilderness girl Izzy). Some fare better than others, but their characters are used well and all provoke at least one chuckle from the audience. There is even some development in character relationships, again some better than others. Some genuinely suprising, all of which contributed to the genuine suspense of seeing who gets voted off the Island.

Also the serial structure made for some nice suspense, it is actually engaging seeing who will get voted off if only due to the outrageousness of the stunts, challenges and character antics. (Personal favorite character is the conniving, sadistic yet cheerful and amiacable host Chris who gleefuly hurls the hapless campers into grueling situations just for kicks!).

Visuals are decent yet unremarkable, Character designs are fairly nice overall, animation is standard flash. The voices are well cast all around.

For the discerning parent, this show is a tad more raunchy than most standard CN fare. The word ""crap"" is thrown around a few times, some fart and pee jokes, a few VEERRRY subtle homosexual jokes and there is some blurred nudity as well (Male and female). Also this being a reality show spoof, some slightly rude/dark humor comes about with the constant conniving and betrayal (It wouldn't be a reality show otherwise right?). The CN version is toned down a tad from the Canadian version but It's not Simpson's level though. Lets say maybe 8 and up.

 That don't bother me none and really is not worse than warrenting a TV-PG rating on TV (G in Canada). To me it helps with the appeal to older viewers, gives the show a little edge that was missing from cartoons for a while.

I wanted to give it 3.5 out of 5 stars. It doesn't QUITE excel, it not a classic by any means either. BUT Total Drama Island earns honorable mention for one of the best cartoons of the past decade, a rock solid comedy that is great for people (not just kids) of all ages who like seeing a good spoof.

Hearty Recommendation.

3722115,4,B001NPDOA4,"Okay. So this is a parody of a reality show, like a mix of Survivor and Fear Factor. This season, anyway. Twenty-two teenagers are dropped off at a crappy summer camp and forced to compete in challenges, with one getting voted off each night. They're divided into two teams at first, but they do merge eventually.
I'll start with the characters. Chris, the host, acts friendly, but he is incredibly sadistic. He loves watching the campers get scared or hurt. But he really does feel like a great character and a fun host. Chef Hatchet, who helps him out, is fun too, but let's get to the campers. I won't go through all of them, but I'll go through the ones that are really interesting:
The campers are stereotypes, but we love them all the more for it. A fan favourite, and the one I rooted for is Gwen, the moody creative Goth girl, who is on the team of the Screaming Gophers. She starts off cool and aloof to most campers, but soon starts to open up and she turns out to be a really nice person and a strong competitor.
Another of my favourites was someone I liked and hated at the same time: Courtney. Her team is the Killer Bass. Courtney's label is the Type A, or the Prep. She's bossy, competitive, argumentative, and makes most people want to slap her in the face with her constant cry of ""I used to be a CIT."" Although (spoiler alert) she does start to loosen up after she starts up a relationship with bad-boy Duncan, she gets voted off in the same episode. However, I still loved what screen time the couple had...although most screen time before their first kiss episode was arguing and flirting.
There are other characters I liked, like dorky Cody, musical and sensitive Trent, silly Lindsay, and insane Izzy, but the most important character to consider is Heather, her label being the Queen Bee. Every season of Total Drama has a villain, and Heather is it for this season. Later on, she would be upstaged with villains like charming but sneaky Alejandro in the third season, and pure evil Mal in the fifth, but she was the first, and a very strong one. She's mean, manipulative, competitive, sneaky, and she will do anything to win, no matter who she steps on to get it. She does everything from making an alliance and enslaving them, to breaking up Trent and Gwen. One of the fan favourite moments is when Lindsay finally sees her true colours and calls her a ""two-faced, backstabbing, lying little *bleep*"". You will honestly be worried that Heather might manage to win! Later on in the series, I actually rooted for her, but then she was up against worse, but she left her mark on the first season, and everyone remembers her for being the manipulative bitch she was here.
The humour of the season is actually very good. There are some immature jokes, mostly centred around gassy food machine Owen, but even he gets a particularly funny gay joke at the start of the series when he remarks that he's glad his cabin is only guys. Lindsay is also especially funny in her stupidity.
Finally, the story. Well, it's a reality show, but what really sells it are the characters and their relationships, be they romantic, friendshippy or the exact opposite. I personally have a soft spot for the constant argue/flirt relationship between Duncan and Courtney, and the calmer but sweet relationship between Trent and Gwen. I also enjoyed some of the friendships and the way people worked together. Most people agree that the best part for airheaded BFFs Katie and Sadie was the scene when they fought for the first time...

3722160,5,B001NPDOA4,"Let me state two things before I begin:

1. I'm 22 years old and virtually all of the animated shows that I watch are aimed at older audiences; things like South Park, Archer, and many Adult Swim shows. My choices in animation are either these or animated television shows from the 90's; things like The Simpsons, The Critic, and Batman: The Animated Series.

2. I HATE reality television!! I feel that it is a blight upon television which not only offends me with its sheer lack of redeeming features but also for slightly lowering what some people accept as good entertainment.

So, what does it say when a spoof of reality television aimed at young teenagers is one of the only cartoons released over the past 10 years that I thought was truly amazing!? How can this be? Let me explain myself.

Well, in acute irony, this show about 22 animated teenagers competing in a ""Survivor"" type show (with a delightfully cruel ""Survivor"" type host) for $100,000 has everything which real reality television sorely lacks.  Said ""everything"" being: good writing, good voice acting, good characters, and actual honest-to-God character development!  I will spend most of the remaining review by focusing on the character development because there is much more to say that's worth saying.

Firstly, as others have already stated, the characters competing are stereotypes of both of teenagers and the contestants on reality television. Others before me have already gone into the names and ""types"" of these characters so I will not.  Despite being somewhat stock characters and often just walking punch lines in the early episodes, something slowly but surely starts happening.  The at first glance generic becomes more fleshed out, more realistic, more developed.  Take note animators as this is what above all else results in a great animated show: characters that entertain AND make you feel something, some genuine emotion!

Something else to note is that this development is both Romanic and platonic.  I'll talk about an example of Romanic development very shortly but for now I'll say that every relation that develops is exactly as funny or believable as the creators intended it to be.  But more unique for a children's cartoon, there's quite a bit of real platonic development.

Beth learns to stand up to Heather. Duncan secretly helps DJ find a new pet rabbit and later sees the value of not having to always act tough with Leshawna. Cody places Gwen's happiness above his own. Gwen becomes close friends with both Bridgette and Leshawna. Geoff and Gwen have a heart-to-heart while visiting a neighboring island with Geoff honestly inviting Gwen to her first party.

As the DVD Verdict Review of Total Drama Island puts it: ""These extended dialogue scenes don't happen often in the show--or in any animated show, for that matter--but it's nicely handled when it does happen. During these few rare moments, the characters cease to be stock types or walking jokes, and instead they almost feel like real people."" I couldn't have said it any better myself.

But now I get to the thing, among many other things, that makes this show worthy of praise: the characters of Gwen, Trent, and their romance.  This was the main focus of the show and a big part of why it was a fantastic ride.  While Gwen was my favorite character, that was because she was the most 3-dimensional and the character who developed the most. Starting out an interesting but withdrawn girl with little experience or skill at social interaction, Gwen develops several true friendships and learns how to open up.  The greatest reason for this is her relationship with Trent. Despite being a Goth and a musician, the two have great chemistry and they form a bond that's as much emotional as it is Romanic.  And this is why the sabotage of their relationship by the deceptions of Heather was so powerful.  As both Gwen and Trent walk to separate sides of the island and start pounding their fists at the ground in an act of catharsis while both powerful music and the loud cries of a broken-hearted Gwen fill the air, I was actually getting teary eyed.  Where their relationship went after that point mattered because I became truly invested in their struggle.  They felt like real people, from the real world.

Don't get me wrong, there are things and features of this show that couldn't happen in the real world: things like a duck running like the Roadrunner from Looney Tunes or the campers running into a pack of giant prehistoric meat-eating beavers.  However, these moments work because they are for the most part very well done and even if they are not the characters are so grounded that it doesn't matter. Also, there are lowbrow gross-out jokes a plenty (ranging from funny to forced). But again, much of it is enjoyable and even when it isn't the characters are so good that you often don't notice it.

So, all in all, this is a show that should be looked at to understand what animated television can rise to and what makes it great: great writing, great voice acting, legitimately funny and clever jokes, being able to appeal to both kids and adults in equal measure, respecting the intelligence of the audience, and characters that one can endlessly watch and become endured to.  Being the textbook definition of ""being greater than the sum of its parts"" this show is lightning!

Sadly, it appeared for a while that Total Drama Island was lightning that only struck once.  The two seasons afterwards, Total Drama Action and Total Drama World Tour, lost the character development that compelled me to write a glowing review for this show.  Furthermore, whatever development had been established in Total Drama Island was erased in favor of contrived fan-service and, following the lead of real reality television, by going too over-the-top to the point of idiocy.  Fortunately, the current season, Total Drama Revenge of the Island, has a new cast of characters and has returned to the (comparatively speaking for a children's cartoon) grounded and believable character development.  I really hope the people working on this show don't drop the ball again because they have something truly unique and worthy of notice.",1330819200,9,6195,4.904214559386973
3722161,5,B001NPDOA4,"In this animated, slightly surreal send-up of Survivor, twenty-two Canadian teens are sent to dilapidated Camp Wawanakwa to compete for $100,000.  Who will win each challenge to claim invincibility?  Who will survive their own ineptitude and the scheming of their fellow campers to claim their marshmallow and another week of safety at the Bonfire Ceremony?  And who will be forced to walk the Dock of Shame to the Boat of Losers and depart, never to return?  Find out on Total Drama Island!

I adore this show, from the clever opening credits and catchy theme song (I wanna be famous!) to the inevitable departure scene.  It's another show that's made for kids but that adults can and do enjoy.  There's no moralising here (something I hate to see in kids' TV), just straight-out fun with lashings of comedy violence and grossness.  The characters are all stereotypes (overachiever, delinquent, cheerful fatty and so on), but when they're so funny and engaging, I don't care, and it's their personalities that drive so much of the drama.  While I have a particular fondness for nice-but-dumb Lindsay, Harold and his ""mad skills"", wise-cracking Gwen and sandwich-short-of-a-picnic Izzy, my favourite is Total Drama Island's host, the vain and sadistic Chris McLean.  He's always ready with an unsympathetic comment and another ridiculous challenge, ably abetted by the very strange Chef Hatchet.

The animation is nothing special, but I like its simple lines and bright colours.  The voice acting is excellent throughout and the music is atmospheric.  The confessional videos in the revolting camp toilet are priceless.  So are the sharks and the bear who pop up in mutiple episodes.

Overall, an excellent animated series.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the sequels, Total Drama Action and Total Drama World Tour, are even funnier!",1328054400,,1842,5.151515151515151

3722196,4,B001NPDOA4,I loved the show and when it was released on dvd i was excited . I was hoping that the dvd was uncensored but sadly it wasn't. Worst of all no reunion special. I hope they include it in total drama action,1290038400,3,204,3.880952380952381
3722197,4,B001NPDOA4,"I got hooked to this cartoon reality show when it first aired in the U.S. on Cartoon Network its uncensored form.  I was really hoping the DVD set would leave in the original dialogue, such as ""Aww crap,"" and the comical bleeps.  I was also really hoping to see the TDI special which explains how the second season came to be.  Oh well.  3 stars for the edits and exclusion of the special episode, but 5 stars for the cartoon show.",1285372800,7,431,4.283950617283951

My daughter is 8 and she loved it! She watches it over and over again.",1283644800,,233,4.2
3722199,5,B001NPDOA4,"My kids and I LOVED this show, and watched it every week.  It has all the silly slapstick humor that kids like, plus a little thrown in for adults.  Its was fun to watch who wasn't going to get the marshmallow (the only one left after Chris passed out the marshmallows without one was kicked off the island).  The person who is kicked off has to walk the ""Dock of Shame"" and catch a ride on the ""Boat of Losers"".  My favorite episode is where they catch up with the losers who have been voted off.  My favorite characters are Jeff (surfer dude), Gwen (goth chick), and Owen (big fat disgusting guy who always passes gas).  The end was a real shocker, very surprising who won the money!",1279411200,,685,4.3125
3722200,5,B001NPDOA4,"This is a cute Survivor like reality show in cartoon style.  Chris tortures a group of teenage campers and the drama abounds.  They do crazy stunts like jumping out of an airplane with bad parachutes and landing onto a couch, blind trapaze  with no net over a small pond filled with jelly fish, a blindfolded William Tell with the arrow and apple thing, all to compete for a 100,000 dollar prize.

They vote off a camper each week.  Sometimes they will conspire to get rid of a fellow camper who then walks down the ""Dock of Shame"" to the ""Boat of Losers"".

The characters go into the outhouse to do personal diaries.  It's funny and quirky.

My 10 year old daughter wanted this for her birthday.  She loves it.  Recommended for all kids under 13 or so.  And not so bad for grownups either.",1254009600,,790,4.416666666666667

8327692,4,B001NPDOA4,"Originally released in 2007, TOTAL DRAMA ISLAND is a 27-episode Canadian animated series that parodies such reality shows as SURVIOR and FEAR FACTOR.  In this instance, twenty-two teenagers are deposited on the fictional island of Wawanakwa, located somewhere in Ontario, but sporting tropical features and unexpected animal life.  The contestants are initially divided into two groups, the Screaming Gophers and the Killer Bass, and then confronted with a series of situations and challenges.  Most of these involve the possibility of death, maiming, or other serious bodily damage.  Episodes usually end with a character being voted off the island.

The characters are essentially a series of stereotypes arising from reality series and from teen stereotypes.  The host, Chris McLean, is a snarky, shallow, and amoral individual more concerned about his on-camera look than the contestants; he is supported by The Chef, a massively built black man who serves as cook and generally henchmen.  The contestants include white, black, and Asian characters, which range from the evil, manipulative girl who is willing to sell out her friends to gain an advantage (Heather) to a very fat, very pale, and very flatulent boy who is thinks the contest is unending fun (Owen.)  Nerds, the socially backward, and hotties abound, and several of the characters are surprisingly sympathetic, with goth girl Gwen and her would-be boyfriend Trent cases in point.

The series is uneven.  The animation style is deliberately flat and artificial, and while that can be fun, it can also be repetitive.  Several of the early episodes are on the dull side, and several of the later episodes contain ideas that are somewhat disturbing; once or twice I thought of the series as a cartoon version of the movie SALO: 120 DAYS OF SODOM, which is easily the most distasteful movie Ive ever seen.  Even so, the characters and the various story lines have hooks, and it is very easy to watch two, three, four episodes before you know it.

Younger children, the twelve and below group, may find it entertainingbut I wouldnt go there.  Its too violent, some of the episodes and storylines will be disturbing, and a large chunk of the show will go over their heads.  This is really a program for thirteen and up, the sort of grotesque humor tweens and teens find hilarious and which adults can latch onto as well.  Somewhat mindless, and not always successful, but unexpected watchable.
