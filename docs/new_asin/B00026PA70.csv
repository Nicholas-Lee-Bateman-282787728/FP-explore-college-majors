2064031,4,B00026PA70,"In the horror flick DEATHDREAM, director Bob Clark and screenwriter Alan Ormsby borrow the basic concept from author W.W. Jacobs' famous short story ""The Monkey's Paw"" and remold it into a low-budget but effective statement against U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. DEATHDREAM tells the story of a U.S. soldier (Richard Backus) who is killed in Vietnam but nonetheless returns home exhibiting some semblance of life. However, unbeknownst to his family--happily surprised to see him after having been informed by the Army that he was killed--he has become a vampiric zombie who must ingest human blood to maintain the pretense of being alive. The problems that his undead state causes for him and his loved ones are really intended as allegorical reflections of the devastating effects of the Vietnam War on returning vets and their families.

 As a horror film, DEATHDREAM is clearly a product of its time. In spite of the compelling plot and the presence of accomplished thespians among the cast--e.g., actor John Marley, here playing the soldier's father, made cinema history with his Oscar-nominated performance as the businessman who wakes up next to a severed horse's head after refusing Marlon Brando's offer in THE GODFATHER (1972)--the dialog is often inordinately histrionic and the acting therefore very melodramatic at times. To be fair, though, these qualities add a sense of surrealism that mostly complements rather than detracts from the film's creepiness, and such histrionics and melodrama actually comprise an aesthetic that is common to many horror greats of the '70s such as Tobe Hooper's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-TEXAS-CHAIN-SAW-MASSACRE/dp/B001APM41C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE</a>&nbsp;(1974), Larry Cohen's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/IT-S-ALIVE/dp/B000HT38B2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">IT'S ALIVE!</a>&nbsp;(1974), and Richard Donner's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-OMEN/dp/B001ARDBWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE OMEN</a>&nbsp;(1976), to name just a few. So DEATHDREAM is not really a bad film. But the fact that its primary theme revolves around the era's counter-culture attitudes towards the Vietnam War, in combination with its palpable 1970s cinematic aesthetic, make it a bit dated, and it therefore hasn't aged quite as well as its better-known contemporaries.

 Regardless of its trivial flaws, DEATHDREAM's infamously disturbing and graphically macabre climax could alone elevate the flick to its status as a minor genre classic. The unique and grisly scene is arguably as chilling as any in the history of horror cinema, and the imagery stays with the audience long after the closing credits have rolled. DEATHDREAM is also notable for marking the first professional film credit for makeup FX legend Tom Savini--just back from a tour in Vietnam himself--who would later do FX work for George Romero on the legendary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DAWN-OF-THE-DEAD/dp/B0001611DI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DAWN OF THE DEAD</a>&nbsp;(1978) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DAY-OF-THE-DEAD/dp/B00D7AM71A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DAY OF THE DEAD</a>&nbsp;(1985) in addition to many other genre classics.

 The DVD release of DEATHDREAM from Blue Underground offers a very good digital transfer, made from a recently discovered negative, in the movie's original widescreen aspect ratio (enhanced for 16x9 TVs). It has been wonderfully restored, though a few filmic artifacts and some color shift are occasionally noticeable. The film was released at various times over the years bearing several different titles, and though it was more commonly known as DEATHDREAM in the U.S. (hence the DVD title), the negative used for this transfer--which is apparently the only complete copy known to exist at this time--uses the title DEAD OF NIGHT in the opening sequence. Interestingly, DEAD OF NIGHT was the title under which the film originally premiered.

 Also on the disc are some pretty cool extras, including two feature commentaries--one with the director; one with the screenwriter--alternate opening titles, a recent interview with actor Richard Backus, a featurette profiling FX man Savini, and more. DEATHDREAM is definitely worthy of a place in the DVD collections of all serious horror fans.",1090281600,48,4503,6.33442088091354
2064032,5,B00026PA70,"Aside from another rediscovered cult classic - LEMORA, A CHILD'S TALE OF THE SUPERNATURAL - DEATHDREAM has always been my favorite horror film from the 1970's that haunted me on numerous late-night TV showings.  I've watched this cult classic countless times and have come in contact with numerous bad quality prints on VHS, complete with extremely cheesy box artwork!!!  For years I've hoped for a DVD remastering of this special film, and now, thanks to Blue Underground, we have the definitive edition.  DEATHDREAM is now in anamorphic widescreen, from a remastered negative and accompanied by juicy extras to please hardcore fans like me!  Although there are times when a bit of grain is still noticeable in a few sequences, this is THE version to own.
For the 'virgin viewer,' you're in for a treat.  DEATHDREAM is a grim, low-key, and extremely eerie film that benefits from great performances by John Marley, Lynn Carlin, and especially Richard Backus as Andy; a chilling AND moving script by Alan Ormsby; an unsettling music score by Carl Zittrer; grisly makeup effects by Orsmby and a young Tom Savini; and screw-tightening direction by Bob Clark. The overall effect is tragic and haunting.
The film was one of the first to address the cataclysmic after-effects of the Vietnam war when veterans returned to their families.  Andy plays one such veteran, a young man whose parents receive the awful news that their son has been killed in action.  The night they receive this information there's a knock at their front door.  It is Andy, although they are shocked at his pale, sunken face and expressionless demeanor.  At first they are elated by his appearance, but as Andy is encouraged by his loved ones to resume where he left off before going off to war, his family begins to realize that something isn't quite right about Andy - something's missing, both physically and emotionally.  Eventually they discover that Andy is indeed dead and has come back to them as a bloodthirsty corpse!
The film manages to move and provoke the viewer as well as frighten him/her.  There are several truly disturbing sequences, and if you are squeamish about needles (like me) I will warn you that they are Andy's prefered method of obtaining blood!  Horror films like these don't appear that often, especially in these irony-addicted times where film-makers seem incapable of taking their subject matter seriously.  Despite a low-budget, DEATHDREAM takes itself very seriously and manages to hold up well alongside scare flicks today!  Rediscover this long-lost classic ASAP.  I recommended viewing this with Bob Clark and Alan Orsmby's other gems - CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS, DERANGED and BLACK CHRISTMAS.  All are similarly atmospheric and way creepy, although DEATHDREAM, in my opinion, is their masterpiece!",1088467200,12,2821,5.1
2064033,4,B00026PA70,"This is a very low budget 1972 horror flick concerning the return of a Vietnam vet to small town America after his parents had been notified he was dead.  He acts very strange, won't eat or sleep, but has a strange craving... Bob Clark, who would become a huge cult icon with Black Christmas, Christmas Story, Porky's and Murder by Decree, cut his teeth on this low budgeter. His talent shines through.  He was lucky enough to get a young Tom Savini to do the bloody effects.  Richard Backus plays the young soldier.  He is quite restrained and very creepy!
This is one of the first anti-Vietnam War films.
You've probably only seen it on late night TV.  Now, Blue Underground releases the film in all it's glory: included are two commentaries (writer and director), an interview with Backus and a short about Savini. This is a must for early 70's horror freaks, and all others are invited to be creeped out!!",1086739200,,909,4.58641975308642
2064034,3,B00026PA70,"Bob Clark's 1974 film Deathdream is a very good try at an American horror movie with a great idea that somehow does not quite gel.  Fusing the Vietnam War with the classic tale ""The Monkey's Paw"", Clark here creates what could have been a minor masterpiece but unfortunately falls short.
The main character, Andy, is a young soldier in the Vietnam War.  One day his parents receive the tragic news that he has been killed.  They are grief-stricken, of course, but cling to the hope that somehow he may still be alive.  The mother, in fact, keeps saying to herself, ""You promised me, Andy""--to return, that is.
And one night, he does.  Naturally his parents are overjoyed.  What they don't know is that Andy has come back as, unfortunately, a walking dead man--a zombie.  At first things seem to be relatively normal, but soon enough Andy's condition starts deteriorating and he needs a lot of blood to keep things healthy, so to speak.
The film starts to fall apart as the Andy's condition itself deteriorates and it becomes basically a gorefest--which for gorehounds is fine, but for those of us who want more can be frustrating.  While the first half of the film is excellent, the second half sags and that's really too bad.
I would really have loved to give this four stars, but it's just not quite there.",1086566400,,1308,4.656521739130435

2064039,4,B00026PA70,"I remember when this movie came out...I had recently been discharged from the Army. I recall reading several reviews at the time that attributed Andy's ""return from the dead"" to a failed  Army experiment...as the Vietnam War was growing increasingly unpopular, the Army tried to find a way to hide the number of casualties by finding a way to reanimate dead soldier's corpses and then sending them back home to their unsuspecting families. This was supposedly accomplished by some type of drug that the military had developed. The possible grotesque use of drugs by the US military was also touched on in a slightly different way in the movie ""Jacob's Ladder"" (1990). Uh-oh... it would seem that the formula still had a few ""minor"" bugs that needed to be worked out!",1497139200,,766,4.847328244274809

One note:  This is an early film of make-up effects wizard Tom Savini, but he is clearly just learning the craft here- the effects are not very good.",1478563200,,421,4.0120481927710845

And I am not going to spoil the movie other than mention that it starts in the war with the guy dyeing there that's the last time they say anything about it. The rest is a proper horror movie of that time frame. Blood gore and dumb people doing things that make you yell at the screen. So don't listen to these wanta be hippies leftist trying to tie some hidden message in this low budget fun film. Veterans did not come back all skewed up in the head ready to snap and kill. It happened but it was rare not common. It was a messed up war that liberals tied the hands of our men to make a terrible place horrible. But the movie is cool.,1472601600,2,808,4.120253164556962

2064053,4,B00026PA70,"Deathdream is one of those few films that slipped through cracks of audiences and fell into obscurity when it had a very very brief run in the early 70's. In the 80's it was released by Gorgon Video on VHS. That's where I discovered it and loved it from the start but even home video couldn't bring this to the forefront of popularity. It still seemed to linger in obscurity really only finding love from the hardcore horror fans. I remember a bunch of us rented this on my recommendation during a sat night horrorthon. It was a zombie themed night so I thought it would fit in nicely as a different type of zombie film. I had already seen it twice and loved it but as it turned out I was the only one out of the 5 of us that enjoyed it. Everyone else wanted to turn it off. I didn't understand back then but I do now. It's a tuff sell to the casual horror fans that are expecting a film like Dawn Of The Dead, Fulci's Zombie or even lower budget zombie flicks like The Dead Pit. This just didn't have the gore, action and horror as those others and some argue that it really isn't a zombie flick. I can see why but it hits too many checks next to the zombie category for it to really be anything else.
The film is a simple plot. A family is told that their son died in action in Vietnam. Not long after the son shows up and the family makes the obvious assumption that the gov got it wrong. What follows is the bizarre personality change and actions the son takes on. Basically it comes down to the son is dead and in order to keep his body from rotting he has to have blood.....so he kills....but his body can never really get enough and he slowly rots away through the film.
One of things that makes this film so fun to watch is the performance of the son Andy. It's like the producers went to a mental hospital in hell and picked this guy up. His crazy stares and gazes. His mannerisms and speech and there are several scenes where he just rocks in a chair and the expression on his face is chilling. You really feel you are looking at evil.
The effects, though there are not that many, are very well done. I think this was Tom Savini's first film for effects and they are great.
The film does suffer a bit from some bad acting in spots but not enough to make this a joke or so bad it's good type. It's pretty solid for the most part. The overall look of the productions is a cheaper type film and possible to some a grindhouse look but without the grindhouse thrills.
Overall this is a decent horror film that doesn't really deserve the obscurity it's received. When it came out on DVD in 2004 I thought it would find a bigger audience and I'm sure it's been discovered by a few more, but it's still pretty much obscured. The film doesn't quite deserve a 4 star yet 3 seems to little. 3 1/2 seems more like it, but I'll give it 4 since I can't do 1/2 stars on my mobile device.
 On a side note, I notice people throwing around ""cult classic"" when looking at reviews on here. As much as I enjoy this film, it certainly can not be considered a cult classic under the definition as I know it. Iv been into the horror scene since the late 70's. Iv been to countless conventions, read all the horror mags, know hundreds of other horror fans and I can tell you this film never had a cult status. Of course the DVD packaging states it on the back, but the distribution companies and studios know that sounds cooler to horror fans and may prompt more sells from the younger unsuspecting horror fan. I mean if it's on the label, it must be true, right?",1435190400,4,3548,4.187134502923977

A little while later, Andy is hitchhiking home and soon arrives at his parents house in the 'Dead Of Night', which is the real title of this movie. What isn't explicitly said or shown but somehow is true, I think, is that the government has somehow reanimated Andy. A real prelude to 'Universal Soldier'. It must be experimental technology at the time, because Andy is certainly not acting normal at all. After a couple of killings in the area, his parents realize it's got to be him. By the end of the movie, his reanimation begins breaking down and he just turns into a homicidal, mindless zombie and no longer looks normal at all. Whatever process that has controlled his decay is now also broken down and he looks like one of the best looking zombies I've seen in any movie.

I admit it, I'm an impulse buyer when it comes to VOD horror, and the title of this one convinced me that it would be something dreamlike and psychedelic, in the vein of Visions of Suffering. Turns out the movie's ""real"" name is Dead of Night, and it's not a strobes-and-lava-lamp production but a horror movie about a Viet Nam vet named Andy who gets killed in the war...and then comes home.
Does it sound like The Monkey's Paw to you? Well, I guess it is pretty much a direct adaptation of the plot to contemporary times, although I only learned that on the internet; I've never read The Monkey's Paw. But maybe I will after seeing this.
What it reminded me of was Fred Vogel's Sella Turcica, a movie I really liked, despite its stilted acting. The acting in this one is stilted to, especially that of Andy, played by Richard Backus in a psychotic flat affect that grew on me as the film went on until I was just about busting a gut at the scene were he goes out on a double date and the three around him are all trying desperately to pretend he's normal.
This is a great slow build movie. I liked the old time production values and the video restoration or whatever is very good except early on there are a few sound flaws. The violence, when it comes, is very intense and well choreographed.
And I love the gutsy political statement. I was born at the tail end of the Nam era and am hence very curious about it. That's one reason I really enjoyed this.",1403827200,,1476,4.328519855595668

2064064,4,B00026PA70,"I first saw this anti-Vietnam movie on a local station in 1978. The quality when I first saw it was poor, but the take on Zombies was unique. It was called ""The Homecoming"" at the time. A son is reported killed in action to a distraught family only to show up at the home a few days later.

Well, you can guess what happens as he decays and seeks blood from the living. The movie was made in 1972 and the only copies came from prints. This version was made from the original negative discovered a few years back and is in 9:16 format. It comes with two commentaries, I believe the director and screenwriter, and some extra features.

Made on a low budget this movie was not bad at all. The same producer/writer also made, ""Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things."" Although, it is a bit dated if you were not around during the Vietnam War, it is a good commentary on the uselessness of war in general. The moral of the Story is a bit like ""The Monkey's Paw"" Be careful what you wish for.

Overall this official release of an old movie lost in some vault brought back memories. The price is right, but don't expect computer generated special effects. It is not your typical slash-horror for the sake of gore movie. This movie has a message as well as some frightening scenes for its time. If you're a Vietnam Veteran you may appreciate this movie. If you are a young ""Walking Dead"" fan you may be disappointed. As a Vietnam era Veteran I give this movie a thumbs up.

The texture is mediocre at best, resembling an unvaried, drudging low-budget horror piece from the 1970's, complete with too many close-ups and bad lighting. The make-up is atrocious, it looks like caked on powder in some scenes. I can not understand how it is rated so highly other than the fact that most people are gullible. One can surely understand the undercurrents and metaphors for the Nixon-era crony scandal and the Vietnam war but that is hardly enough to regulate it to horror masterpiece.

2064074,3,B00026PA70,"Deathdream (Bob Clark, 1974)

Bob Clark has made some terrible, terrible movies over the course of his career, from Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things in 1973 to the movie that killed him in Hollywood, Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 in 2004. (Clark was killed in a car accident three years later.) But among the dross of Rhinestone, Porky's II: The Next Day, and Loose Cannons were some real gems. Clark was responsible for what may be the greatest holiday film of all time, A Christmas Story (and honestly, it's one of only two Christmas-themed films I can still watch without gagging on the sweetness; it's probably not coincidence that Clark also helmed the other, Black Christmas, ten years before). The underrated teen comedy Turk 182! was Clark's doing as well. And then there is Deathdream, also released as Dead of Night (and presumably changed because, let's face it, that's one of the most overused movie titles in film history). While it's nowhere near as good as A Christmas Story, or even Black Christmas, it's an interesting exercise that takes some of the themes from Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things, tacks on an almost incoherent anti-war message, and comes out the other side looking at least presentable enough to take home to meet the folks.

As we open, the Brooks family--father Charles (The Godfather's John Marley), mother Christine (Faces' Lynn Carlin), and sister Cathy (Anya Ormsby, returning from Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things)--are waiting for news from brother Andy (Camelot's Richard Backus), who's off fighting in Vietnam. Unfortunately, they learn the truth of ""be careful what you wish for"" twice over. First off, they receive notice that he's been killed in action. Then, in response to his mother's desperate prayers that he return to them, he shows up in the middle of the night after hitching a ride with a trucker who's mysteriously found dead the next day. Needless to say, the two events are connected; Andy is a much-changed person from the one who left to go to war. In fact, he's not really a person at all any more, though what type of creature he is (vampire? zombie? ghoul? no one knows) is never stated. While it's obviously a horror film (Andy needs flesh and blood to survive, and goes about getting it about as often as the plot will allow), Deathdream spends a good deal of time focusing on the rest of the Brooks family, and the way the changes in Andy's behavior and demeanor strain the rest of the family bonds. That's not the kind of ting you really expect to see in a horror film; it's much more drama territory (think about the many Lifetime Original Movies about how the family goes on after a child's death--an obvious parallel here), but Clark pulls it off pretty nicely.

Clark was making this movie on a shoestring, and to be blunt, it shows. Save Marley, no one here is all that good an actor, and Marley seems to have been coached to overact as much as the rest of the cast was. The script, too, has a number of interesting ideas that never go anywhere; Clark and longtime screenwriting partner Alan Ormsby had some great ideas about where to start diverging from the basic concepts of Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things, but their background in exploitation film kept overtaking their desire to make what seemed to be a serious drama with an anti-war subtext. (Seriously, you can tell it wants to be there, but it never manages to get off the ground.) Still, despite them shooting themselves in the foot at every juncture, Deathdream remains interesting throughout, if perhaps less plausible than it demands to be.

Perhaps the best remake news floating around, as I write this, is that a Deathdream remake, with the working title Zero Dark Thirty, which has been floating around Hollywood for years, is finally underway with Paul Solet (Grace) directing and John Stalberg (High School) writing. I'm quite optimistic about this one, but while you're waiting for it to come out, hunt down the original; it's worth your time. ***",1299542400,,4022,4.8246376811594205
2064075,4,B00026PA70,"Bob Clark has certainly had an interesting and varied film career, and though his venture into horror only lasted three films, he certainly had a way with a horror yarn.  And he could pull it off rather inexpensively.
Deathdream is a horror film with an anti-war message, made during the Vietnam era.  In the movie, ""Andy"" is killed in Vietnam.  Back home, his parents and sister receive word of this, and don't have much time to grieve coz guess who comes a-callin' later that night?  Everyone's happy to see him, especially after the bomb that had dropped on them earlier, but Andy's not quite the same guy he was.  He seems catatonic-he says and moves very little, except when he's killing the family dog or the locals for their blood.  His dad is suspicious from the start, and his mother is so obsessed and overjoyed to have Andy back that she is oblivious to it all, even when he starts rotting away.  No concrete explanation is given as to why Andy comes back, other than his mother wanting it so badly, but it makes no difference.  It really doesn't matter.
This was obviously an attempt to present the horrors of war and the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and drug addiction(Andy injects the blood he acquires like a junkie) suffered by veterans after they returned home.  But done so in a horror movie context.  In fact, the horror angle really even wouldn't be necessary as Andy doesn't show signs of zombiedom till later in the film.  Or maybe the message is that many soldiers acted like zombies when they came back?  Either way, the film is very entertaining and creepy.  It's much better than the plot would initially suggest.  John Marley and Richard Backus are exceptionally good.  And you know with a plot as grim as this, things can't end very happily.
Younger folks who think the SAW series is what a good horror is will immediately write this movie off as bad when they get a look at the obvious low budget, lack of star power, and use of-God Forbid-pacing.  Plus, the initial message will be completely lost to them.  But that's okay, horror fans dig this film, and it's not like Deathdream is in any kind of competition with the modern greasy haired ghostly Japanese kid movies that sometimes star Sarah Michelle Gellar.
A great example of what made the horror films from the 70s so groundbreaking, original, and repeatedly ripped off and remade.
Blue Underground has once again made an acceptable DVD, giving us an interview with Backus and also an interview with Tom Savini, being his usual fake, jovial self(I say ""fake"" coz I've met the guy and he's a class A jerk).

Bob Clark(BLACK CHRISTMAS) masterfully directs this unsettling story with the less is more technique.  A family is devastated when they receive the tragic news about their son Andy, who perished in the line of duty during the Vietnam War.  Before the grief even settles in, they are awoken that night by an even greater shock.  A late-night visitor...

""They sent us a telegram.  They said my son was dead""...

""I was"".

Andy then smiles to ease some of the awkward tension, but it soon becomes evident that something just isn't right.  He doesn't eat, sleep, or hardly speak.  He just stares blankly as he sways back and forth in the family rocking chair.
We soon realize he must inject human blood into his veins in order to survive.  Or should I say, sustain his weary state of existence.

This is an extremely powerful anti-war commentary.  Of course very relevant still today, nobody can escape the effects of battle unscathed.  Deathdream slowly builds toward the frightening climax with thick doses of tension.  Tom Savini shows his superb touches here with his brilliant early special effects work.

2064078,3,B00026PA70,"Deathdream is a movie from either 1972 or 1974 depending on if you see the credits at the end of the movie or if you look at the product listing. Anyway, its a 70's movie. And its a gem from that era. The remastering on the dvd makes it look almost like the movie was made in the present day. The only way you can tell what time it was from was by the fashions and cars.

Deathdream is about a soldier returning home from the war. He actually gets killed during the war. But later we find out he is not really dead. Or is he? Once he is home we find out some strange things are going on with the soldier (Andy). He is not acting like a normal person. He is transforming into an evil entity. There is a murder that happened and Andy soon becomes a suspect.

This movie was ahead of its time. It dealt with an issue not typical in flicks back then. It is a horror movie but it was different from the norm. I loved seeing how evil Andy was becoming. Richard Backus turned in a good performance. He convinced me about what evil really is.

The make-up effects were done by a young Tom Savini. The movie was directed by Bob Clark (Black Christmas).

The disk comes with two commentaries, a 12 minute vinette with Richard Backus (it is interesting to see how much he had aged in 30-plus years), a 10 minute segment with Tom Savini, & a few other features. They did an excellent job remastering the movie like I stated earlier.

2064081,3,B00026PA70,"Deathdream/Dead of Night is very interesting when viewed in the context of the Vietnam veteran returning home.  The veteran has been changed by his experience and none of his family or friends seem to know or care.  His father and the postman claim that they went to World War II and came back fine.  His mother, near hysterics, wishes desperately for everything to be fine.  His sister invites him out on a double-date with his former girlfriend: both tell him that it'll be just like the old days and they can ""pick up where they left off.""  However, Andy is numb to all this.  The only thing that drives him is the need to inject junk into his veins; though he's out of Vietnam, he's being eaten alive...almost literally.  You see, Andy is a zombie brought back by his mother's prayer.  His flesh is rotting, and the junk he injects into his veins isn't heroin but the blood of the living.

Spotting allegorical moments like this is very fun--too bad the movie isn't great.  Andy's mom comes across as a complete loon, with Lynn Carlin overacting outrageuously.  Andy's Dad flipflops between happiness that his son is back and surliness/suspicion.  The part's not written terribly convincingly and John Marley is little help.  Andy himself sometime elicits unintentional giggles, especially when he comes down for his first date in sunglasses and leather gloves.  Only Jane Daly, as Joanne, elicits much feeling from the audience.  The direction is reasonably competant, though the film stock looks cheap, and Tom Savini's makeup work is effective.

Overall the film is still perhaps worth a recommendation, especially if you enjoy reading into films.  However, please disregard people who say that this is ""basically The Monkey's Paw.""

2064085,4,B00026PA70,"First , a few things to get out of the way, this is NOT a Zombie movie at all. I laughed at some of the reviews saying it's a zombie flick, It's not, it's more along the lines of a dramatic thriller mixed in with a supernatural twist (the undead part).

A typical vehicle of the 70's. The 70's and early 80's flicks took advantage of the attention of Vietnam to come up with these anti-war flicks (Soldiers coming home but never being the same, being either violent or suicidal and ultimately hurting themselves or others). Enter ""Deathdream"" which skims over into the crazed Vet coming home to kill phase.

Andy is allegedly killed in Vietnam. His family is devasted but Andy , however, is displaying psychotic, and violent tendecies as time goes on. He kills a truck driver, kills a dog, and then well I won't spoil.

A great acting job by Richard Backus as he shows us the detoriation of one kind man corrupted by war and violence into a crazed soldier. The performances all around are excellent but like I said, it's not a zombie movie. The only zombie twist is that the guy's dead but that can easily be put into the supernatural category.  The ending is very predictable, but this is quite an entertaining descend into madness, and social. commentary by Bob Clark. I don't think he needed the zombie twist at all but perhaps thought it was necessary to sell the film. Speaking of which includes early makeup effects by Tom Savini.

2064086,4,B00026PA70,"I had read good reports about ""Deathdream"", but I didn't expect much from this film as the opening soldiers-in-action prologue passed into the credits, and then to a humble family meal, as the atmosphere was too reminiscent of countless low budget, mid 1970's movies that used to show up on TV all the time. But to my surprise the film turned out to be far more effective and well made than I expected.

The rather cheap wartime opening served to introduce that character of Andy, although it is not handled very well at all and the characters are hard to distinguish. Luckily it's not really necessary, as the first important scene is the one that follows, in which the family meal I mentioned above is interrupted by an army officer carrying a telegram...the house visitor that every parent dreads. This important scene is handled surprisingly well, as Andy's mother, father and sister react to the news that Andy won't be coming home again. Luckily, this effective scene is not a mere one off, but just the start of what turns out to be a gruesome and thought-provoking horror/drama. Soon after the tearful telegram scene, the family's grief turns to elation as to their surprise, Andy suddenly turns up in the middle of the night seemingly alive and well...but unfortunately, he's neither.

I think a lot of the power of the film comes from the fact that the acting is all so good. With no big star names, there is still no major weak link anywhere in the film, and everyone seems to behave naturally and believably. The script has been written remarkably realistically and all of the characters act and speak like real people, without having any silly horror movie conventions to wrangle with. In fact the whole screenplay reads like a dream, as the time between Andy's arrival and the suspicions of various people that something is wrong happen about as fast as would naturally be expected. Andy's very first night at home comes at the cost of the life of a truck driver who gives him a lift, and as soon as one of the first characters outside of the main family (the doctor) actually meets him, he immediately suspects that something is wrong and decides to go the police without any hesitation. This refreshing realism does not mean of course that Andy does not get to cause some serious havoc before the end of the movie, and the highlight of his brief rampage is the drive-in movie scene in which Andy's sudden fury and hideous appearance are genuinly shocking.

As I said, the film has a low budget feel which hampers it, but the performances of Andy's mother, father and sister are all very good, and really lift the film up a level. Even the smaller roles are good, right down to the bunch of kids that visit Andy in the family back yard, or the police officers and local doctor. A special mention should also go to the actress playing Andy's former girlfriend who's re-acquaintance with him is far from the happy event she must have dreamed of. Of course it is the performance of Richard Backus as Andy that has to carry the main weight, and he is extremely effective, as he is required to present a character who is subtly not quite right, but still believeable. He's also quite convincingly evil, and the scenes of him constantly rocking back and forth in that damned creaky chair made me wish someone would just punch him!

The story is based loosely on the age-old tale of ""The Monkey's Paw"", so you don't need reminding that there is no happy ending. A vague anti-war message seems to be in the background, but the general intention seems to be just to to portray the horror of what is happening to one very ordinary family. In this the film succeeds wonderfully. A genuine little gem, rewarding and memorable to watch.",1151971200,5,3738,4.65052950075643

Apparently, the film was only released in the American south, which may explain why I've never heard of it. Anything that didn't hit the north (meaning New York) was never likely to see the UK light of day. The plot sounded hilarious. Guy comes home dead - strangles the dog so his mum packs him off to a drive-in movie with an old date. With mixed results. As it turned out the film is like one of those bad taste parody sketches. Frequently daft and directorially undistinguished, I rather admire the uncompromising last ten minutes.

The problem is if you are going to rip off 'The Monkey's Paw', it helps if you actually have the paw, or a similar McGuffin. Can be a tin whistle. How about a fluffy toy bunny? Magic spoon (wooden) or even mysterious lawn mower. But mum just muttering to herself just does not cut it. As a recent war in the Middle East will no doubt confirm, just wanting Johnny home, well, let's just say the door bell ain't gonna ring without that McGuffin. I know, how about a hedgehog? Sinister stuffed hedgehog from Bahrain. Well, they might have them. Remember producers: unless you produce the monkey, we won't give a monkey's.

Extras: Astonishingly, the only thing Tom Savani took away from the Vietnam war is the free anatomy lessons. This guiless disinterest in the political is probably why America is still blowing people apart around the globe without bothering to read road signs.

2064089,5,B00026PA70,"Director Bob Clark will always hold a special place in every horror film fan's heart thanks to ""Black Christmas,"" a terror filled slasher/suspense flick that puts the viewer on the edge of his or her seat. The movie's downbeat tone, sterile yet highly effective cinematography, fleshed out characters, and numerous twists and turns add up to one heck of a rollercoaster ride. Those horrific phone calls alone are worth the price of admission. Clark could have rested on his laurels with ""Black Christmas,"" no problem, but he pushed forward with an eclectic mix of films that find most fans of his horror films shaking their heads in wonderment. Clark made the phenomenally entertaining ""A Christmas Story,"" the Jean Sheperd adaptation that stands as one of the last successful Christmas films released by Hollywood. He also made an engaging Sherlock Holmes picture, ""Murder by Decree,"" starring the venerable Christopher Plummer as the master sleuth. I could go on and on, citing the infamous ""Porky's"" and ""Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things"" as further evidence of this director's versatility. All good things eventually pass, however, and now we see Clark helming dreck like ""Baby Geniuses"" and its vomit inducing sequel.

We can't forget about ""Deathdream,"" a picture that came out around the same time as ""Black Christmas."" It's a minor Bob Clark entry but an unforgettable experience. The film opens with Andy Brooks (Richard Backus) receiving what looks to be a fatal wound in Vietnam. Is Andy dead? It doesn't look like it since we see him hitching a ride with a trucker over here in the States shortly thereafter. He's trying to go back to see his family--father Charles (John Marley sans horse head), mother Christine (Lynn Carlin) and sister Cathy (Anya Ormsby)--in an apparent effort to fulfill his loving mother's request to ""come back home."" But something is dreadfully wrong with Andy Brooks, something the truck driver who picks him up discovers much to his everlasting detriment. Andy's kin are so happy to have him back, especially considering the military had already informed them that he perished in the war, that they don't notice anything wrong with the boy at first. Sure, he's uncommunicative, pale, and has a tendency to sit in a rocking chair for hours in his darkened room, but war does strange things to a man. It's a plausible excuse that masks for a time the bizarre behavior that now characterizes Andy Brooks's thoughts and deeds.

By the time Andy kills the family dog with his bare hands, Charles knows something is seriously wrong. His wife refuses to believe anything negative about her son: her boy came home safe and sound and that's that. Andy's sister Cathy recognizes the warning signs just as her father does, but the fact that her brother has always been her parents' favorite child seriously hampers her ability to do anything about the situation. She does enlist the aid of her boyfriend to bring Andy's girlfriend over to the house, however, hoping that the girl's presence will lift her brother out of his funk. Before that horrific reunion plays out in gory detail, Charles Brooks decides to bring in Doc Allman (Henderson Forsythe) in an effort to discover what's wrong. People can hide a lot of things from their loved ones, very personal things both mental and physical, but it's a whole different story when dealing with a physician who has taken care of you from birth. Doc Allman discovers what's ailing Andy, but he soon wishes he hadn't. By the time the authorities learn what happened to the poor doctor, Andy is heading over to the drive-in with his girlfriend, his sister, and her boyfriend. Alas, our morose soldier is about to have a meltdown in a literal and figurative sense that will claim several lives before the movie screeches to its heartbreaking denouement. ""Deathdream"" is a wrenching film.

Apparently, Bob Clark had a heckuva time finding a steady distributor for his movie. This thing came out under so many different titles that it's no wonder most people never saw it, or don't remember it if they did. The problem in getting this film out, elaborated on in the extras but apparent while watching the movie, deals with the subject matter: ""Deathdream"" is a film about the horrors of Vietnam and that war's impact on a typical family, and it came out while the war was still an extremely touchy subject with the American public. People just didn't want to see a horror movie about the conflict a mere year or so after the government yanked combat troops out of South Vietnam. That's unfortunate because ""Deathdream"" is an amazing film in spite of its relatively low budget. The performances from Backus and Marley are top notch, and Lynn Carlin will tug at your heartstrings as a mother who will go to great lengths to protect her damaged son. That final scene involving the local police, Andy, and Christine Brooks will stay with you long after the credits roll, and not because it's particularly gory. There is bloodshed and lots of shocks, though; enough that it's surprising the film received a 'PG' rating.

Someone at Blue Underground really loves this film as evidenced by the plethora of meaty extras. A commentary track with Clark and one with writer Alan Ormsby, a trailer, an extended opening sequence and alternate ending, an enlightening interview with special effect's guru Tom Savini, and a talk with Richard Backus provide more than enough information on all aspects of the film's creation and distribution difficulties. ""Deathdream"" may well rank as one of the best films you've never heard about, and you'll want to see it if you're jonesing for offbeat '70s horror flicks.",1111104000,4,5673,4.93717277486911
2064090,4,B00026PA70,"Yes, as you have already figured out this is a pretty campy, cheesy movie, but it is a very good represenative of how things were going for us at that time. I have am added fondness, as this was filmed just a block from my home. It disrupted the entire neighborhood for several months and the uproar when ""outsiders"" found out it was a horror movie was so funny. Some of us were background ""extras"" and had quite a blast. The house has finally gone up for sale after the last of the original family has gotten on in years and the younger generation doesn't want something so large, so if you're interested, and have a spare $419,000.00 you might want to look this one up.

2064091,4,B00026PA70,"I'm sure you've already read some reviews on this movie's plot so let me just cut to what I really wanted to say.

After reading so many good reviews on this movie, from Amazon and else where, I deceided to give it a shot. When I was reading all these pretty decent reviews almost every one said that this movie has virtually no gore. When I sat down to watch this, I started to think that this no gore effect would let me down, I mean it has a PG rating. Anyway I was surprised at how entertaining this movie is.

No, it's not gory at all (with the exception of one scene with very cheesy blood). But anyways this movie really doesn't need it. It really keeps you interested and I think that is one of the most important things to look for in a film. Also, the plot is pretty good as well.

Also, the movie achieves three or four ""surprise"" scares that make you jump.

The acting is decent as too. About your average for a horror. The ending isn't really anything surprising, but still good.

So, a pretty interesting little movie. Check it out if you're into good horror/exploitation.",1108080000,,1086,4.330049261083744
2064092,3,B00026PA70,"The reputation of this semi-legendary, rarely seen(until now) horror film suggests that it's much better than it actually is. Don't get me wrong: this isn't a bad movie. John Marley and Richard Backus both give strong performances and the script is scathingly critical of the Vietnam War, but ""Deathdream"" moves at a snail's pace. I found myself yawning about halfway through, and when things finally started to pick up it was just too late to redeem the film(for me, anyway). You expect this kind of pacing from 1930s and '40s films--not from something made in 1974.

The last fifteen or twenty minutes of ""Deathdream"" are compelling; the movie ends with a much-needed bang. What disappointed me the most, I suppose, was that I was expecting a lot of creepy atmosphere from this film, and it just didn't deliver on that count. Bottom line: interesting, but not great. Kudos to Alan Ormsby and Tom Savini for Backus's wonderful zombie makeup.",1101772800,,942,4.9245283018867925
2064093,5,B00026PA70,"Many of us baby-boomers remember ""Deathdream"" as a staple of late night T.V. horror flicks like ""Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things"" and ""Psychomania."" Many films in this B-Movie horror genre, when released on DVD, get the ""Budget Buy"" treatment: just the movie, no cool ""behind the scenes"" or ""Movie Trailer"" extras.

So imagine how jazzed I was to pick up this DVD expecting only the bare-bones movie, and found a cool mountain of extras including Commentary by Director Bob Clark, Commentary by screenwriter Alan Ormsby (who also wrote and starred in the abovementioned ""Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things""), a Tom Savini feature, an interview with lead man Richard Backus, not to mention the cool theatrical trailer.

Just hours after learning that Andy has been killed in Vietnam, his family is pleasantly shocked to find their lost beloved show up at their doorstep, looking very much alive, albeit a bit shell-shocked. With vampiric needs and zombie mannerisms, the horror ride begins!

Of the bonus features, I enjoyed the interview with Richard Backus the most. When I read that the interview length was 12 minutes, I thought it would be low key and trivial, but the crew wound packing a lot of cool information into that 12 minutes! Richard Backus has aged really well, and its hep to see that he has fond memories of his campy first film role. He is even good-humored enough to recreate one of his more over-the-top moments in the film! Backus went on to appear in a number of movies and several Soaps, including ""As the World Turns"" into the early 1990s.

As for the film itself, what trips me out about ""Deathdream"" is that while it has a low budget and campy feel, the performances, direction, and editing are quite exceptional. Also starring in the movie are John Marley (who is probably remembered best for waking up next to a horse's head in ""The Godfather.""), and Lynn Carlin (in my opinion, one of the most underrated actresses from the 60s & 70s. She was exceptionally good as an unstable mother in the almost forgotten 1973 film ""Baxter""). The majority of actors in this flick went on to get a healthy dose of work in the TV and movie industry, and even the folks whose only role was in ""Deathdream"" did a good job.

Aside from the horrid looking bloodbath in a doctor's office that looks more like a botched interior paint job, the make-up and effects are impressive. Andy's deteriorating appearances, be they subtle or excruciating, look cool!

For those of you who remember ""Deathdream"" from the Land of Late Night TV Past, this movie plus the extra features will be a fun trip down memory lane. If you have never seen this before and are a connoisseur of campy horror, this is essential for your collection!",1091923200,21,2744,4.7784810126582276

8022890,5,B00026PA70,"I highly recommend this movie, 8/10! (8/10 = worth buying/rewatching)

The quality of the transfer is simply amazing! While it is unfortunate that nothing can be done about the grain of the source footage if you use the correct settings on your TV it is far less noticeable.

While I haven't watched all of the extras as yet, the ones I have seen are highly informative and entertaining. They even included promotional materials INCLUDING industry promotional materials, even the press kit =^.^=! Thankfully the original choice for Andy didn't end up in the final product as his performance was abysmal (while painful to watch, I am still glad to have it).

While the box art is ugly the reverse side is better. I would like it if Blue Underground would send me the files for the box art so I could make my own as I prefer the original DVD box art as well as the earlier (VHS) box art :D.",1521158400,,888,4.503105590062112

 Aside from film geeks (yes, I confess I am one  as if you didn't know) anyone who pays some attention to the names of film directors probably only knows Bob Clark for the justifiably popular A Christmas Story. But very early in his career he helmed a trio of horror films of which this is the second (amusingly he followed it with Black Christmas, generally considered the first slasher film). Here he reteamed with Alan Orsmby, the writer/star of  Children Shouldnt Play with Dead Things, (a film every bit as quirky and kinky as the title suggests) and Ormsby crafted possibly one of the most socially relevant horror movies ever made. In a variation of The Monkeys Paw a family receives the news their son, Alan, has been killed in combat (Vietnam is never specifically mentioned). Even though we have seen him blown away at the very start of the film he shows up on their doorstep. Hes not quite himself, however; hes withdrawn and mostly sits in a rocking chair in his room, possibly the same one where wed earlier seen mom chanting her denial  has she wished him back to life? But hes more undead than alive and he requires human blood to keep going, resulting in a small-town killing spree.
 Clarkes and Ormsbys film deals with the effects of the Vietnam conflict on the home front  and is one of the earliest films to have done so. Defunct soldier Alan (Richard Backus) no longer fits in after returning from battle and has a serious addiction problem. Mom (Lynn Carlin) is in denial while dad (John Marley) cant figure out how to deal with the situation; a clearly shaky marriage is probably beyond salvaging. For all its sociological resonances Clarks film still delivers the horror goods because the message is inferred rather than stated outright. Theres a very creepy cat-and-mouse sequence in a shadowy doctors office but most of the action is staged in bright, general lighting and in actual locations. This likely reflects the tight budget but it also grants the film a sense of reality. The acting is superior for a low-budget film of the era and if Marley and Carlin have showier parts  and are surprising catches for a film of this type  it may be Backus deadpan performance that makes the film so unsettling. And this is a film thats more eerie than gory; for all their violence the moments of attack are mostly offscreen or out of frame. Tom Savini  recently returned from service in Vietnam himself  doesnt ply his famous gore effects here but rather supplies a gruesome makeup for Alan as he deteriorates. Deathdream is not nearly as famous as it should be. I hope this Blu Ray release corrects that.",1516579200,,2711,4.664570230607967

8022897,2,B00026PA70,Love the movie but this blu ray from Blue Underground should have stayed unreleased. This is one bad looking image. The old DVD looks as good. Its supposed to be a 2K restoration from the camera negative but something went wrong because the blacks are beyond noisy (how many different shades of black can there be in one frame?) to the point not being able to see anything. The colors are changing in many scenes (check out the 37:00 mark) and the detail is beyond dull and flat to the point of changing to black and white! Huge disappointment for us Bob Clark fans since we have been waiting for a decent release of this classic. Great movie but horrible release from Blu Underground.,1512000000,,685,4.532258064516129
