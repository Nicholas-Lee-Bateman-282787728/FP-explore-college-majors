7841523,5,6303196179,"The Dinosaurs is a wonderful Documentary that was by PBS and seen on television. Plus, my only son liked those episodes. Those four episodes featured one of his favorite Dinosaurs that that were brought to life by high quality Animation like the Iguanodon ""seen as a Walking Skeleton in the first episode"", the Struthiomimus, the Edmontosaurus, the Troodon, the Pachyrhinosaurus, the Apatosaurus, the Herrarosaurus, the Corythosaurus or probably the Hypacrosaurus, the Triceratops & the Tyrannosaurus Rex aka T.Rex Such as the Mother, her 3 little darling hatchlings & the dying one all skin & bone. Including 2 ancient Reptiles The Mososaurus & Saurosuchus. It's really great but there's just one problem. My only son isn't into VHSES anymore. They get crumbled up, shred into tiny pieces, break in two & get jammed aka stuck in head sets. Worse, The Picture gets fuzzy every time people rewind tapes over & over again. He as much as everyone else prefers DVDS and Blu Rays better these days. My son wish that all four episodes of The Dinosaurs ""The Monsters Emerge"", ""Flesh on the Bones"", ""The Nature of the Beast"" & ""The Death of the Dinosaurs"" to come out on DVD. Only time will tell.",1517443200,,1188,4.8861386138613865
