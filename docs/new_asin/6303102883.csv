568961,3,6303102883,I am a big Vincent Price fan but I did not like this movie at all. It is kind of stupid. Not entertaining at all. sorry,1116979200,,119,3.6153846153846154
568962,3,6303102883,"I just show the movie a couple of days ago on Fox Movie Channel. Even though Vicent Price is given top billing, it's more of a supporting role. I wasn't too crazy about it's premise (cowboys in South Africa). However, by the end of the movie, I liked it.

As previous reviewers have stated, granddaughter and grandfather (Price) try to protect gold from 5 outlaws. One of them falls for the granddaughter and decides to change his ways. Not original, but fun since it takes place in South Africa rather than the old west.  I've haven't seen the original, YELLOW SKY, so I can't comment if this film is better or worse.

As far as the length of the film is concerned, the one I saw on Fox Movie Channel had a runing time of 93 minutes. If there is a longer version, either Fox doesn't have the missing scenes or it really is only 93 minutes and the distribution company made a mistake on the running time.",1101340800,,904,4.369047619047619
568963,3,6303102883,"The technical part of this review refers to the Brentwood Home Video or BCI Eclipse version.
A western set in Africa with Vincent Price! What more could you ask for? In reality, you could ask for a bit more. Mr. Price plays a prospector who lives with his granddaughter and happens to have a ton o' gold hidden away. Along come the bad men who want to take the gold and the girl away. Mr. Price is the cunning wily old codger you'd expect him to be. After seeing him in almost exclusively horror fare, it was a pleasure to see him tackle this role. And I bet HE had a good time with it. It shows! A routine western made better with the African location.
The print used was not too bad. Scratches, splices, etc. were minimal. The color by DeLuxe has faded and can be quite noticeable in indoor settings, but not enough to detract from the story. 20th Century Fox originally released this picture, which was 105 minutes in length by all sources I could find. Some company called Rawhide Home Video must have bought the rights, took off the 20th Century Fox logo and put some cheap title card on the beginning. In the process, they must have chopped 12 minutes out of it somewhere. To be honest, I don't know where the editing took place. With such an unknown feature, this will probably be the only chance to see this movie. I wouldn't look for Fox to release a remastered, uncut version any time soon.
Brentwood/BCI does their usual job with features of 6 chapter stops, a Max Fleischer cartoon and trivia game. A decent transfer for the price. This movie is also in a 10 pack of westerns at about triple the price for this one film from Brentwood Home Video called ""The Wild West"" and is available from Amazon.com.",1079568000,7,1714,4.427215189873418
7838673,2,6303102883,"The DVD case was cracked. The film print quality is terrible. It's like a copy of a copy. The TMG logo shows up for a few minutes. And it cuts off very quickly at the end.

No special features

This 1967 T.V. movie western stars Vincent Price as a fat, slobbish, old guy who is protecting a gold mine. The setting is not the West, but Africa. Price proves his acting chops losing himself in the role. You won't find his macabre horror film persona here. Nor his usual polish and sophistication. He truly was a great actor. This would be a better film if the DVD quality was good.",1512259200,,579,4.254545454545455
7838674,5,6303102883,This is an excellent movie. Price's performance is superb showing that he always has been a versatile actor. The South African scenery is wonderful.,1430524800,,148,5.208333333333333
7838675,5,6303102883,"I've had this for a while and watched a few times and thought it was good then better and now I think it's one of his best films.
It isn't typical Vincent Price but most of his best movies are not horror! Like the other western More Dead Than Alive with Clint
Walker! and House of 7 Gables original version, Dragonwyck, Shock! and House of 1,000 Dolls are all excellent and Price is
great in all of them. This odd Australian film is well written and directed with a kinda of spaghetti western feel but not that bad!
The acting is quite good by everybody and Price gives a great performance! He didn't start out as a horror master and most of
his early movies like Laura he played the handsome playboy or boyfriend which he is great in Laura also. How he got into this
movie is a good question but he must have just wanted to do something different. How any Price fan can say this isn't good I
don't understand because Price is excellent and it's not even close to being a BAD movie! so enjoy Price in a PRICELESS role!
If you can find Price in a copy of ""Dream Job"" a TV episode and Collector's Item with Peter Lorre TV Pilot get them!!!!",1414368000,,1138,4.224770642201835
7838676,2,6303102883,"Would rate the picture/sound of this DVD as being poor VHS-like quality. That said, this rare movie probably is not available in a remastered DVD quality version so if you want to view it, this seems to be the only game in town---I have another shorter version of this movie on DVD, but this too is of low VHS quality in my opinion.",1376870400,,332,4.285714285714286
7838677,1,6303102883,"I was attracted to this film because of its South African location.  I had a hunch that it was going to be bad because South African film-making of the 1960s was not up to par with the rest of the world.  Even Vincent Price, who I enjoy as an actor, cannot redeem this movie.  The characters and the story are formulaic and standard, and the relationship between the female and male lead is not believable in the least.  Save your money and your time.  I am left wondering why any company would ever release this on DVD.",1370217600,,520,4.319587628865979
7838678,3,6303102883,"First a word about 'gray market' DVDs--
Often, transfers are not of the highest quality. The movies themselves are unrestored and rarely pristine (but still watchable), extras are non-existent and inclusion of artwork or liner notes varies by manufacturer. These niche companies can however provide a valuable outlet for movies unavailable anywhere else.

With motion picture titles, a tiny word like ""The"" can mean a huge difference. Example:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-Desperate-Hours/dp/B00008Z44E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE Desperate Hours</a>&nbsp;is a 1955 Humphrey Bogart film while&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Desperate-Hours/dp/B00005V9HX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Desperate Hours</a>&nbsp;is a 1990 Mickey Rourke rehash.

This is more apparent with THE Jackals, a 1967 South African-made movie, and Jackals, the McRaney/Brimley title that others seek. (As of 9/09, the 1986 Jackals was not available in any home video format.) They are completely unrelated.

THE JACKALS is a near-literal remake of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/YELLOW-SKY/dp/B000EHSVWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">YELLOW SKY</a>&nbsp;(1948). Its original American western ghost town is now set in equally forbidding Suid Afrikaner veldt. Vincent Price is top-billed probably for marquee value, but his is a supporting role.

Here, prospector Price and his granddaughter are beset by a robber gang. They want Vinny's gold; their leader also desires the tomboyish young lady.

7838679,1,6303102883,An awful movie from start to finish -- truly painful to watch.  Vincent Price gives the worse performance of his career and one of the worst in the film -- I can honestly say that no actor (or the sole actress) in the film was credible or even mildly entertaining.  A terrible film.,1208563200,2,282,4.30188679245283
7838680,5,6303102883,"Most Vincent Price addicts are horror film fans (like me) -- for that reason, some of his followers might not be so crazy about this film, clearly a late entry in his brilliant career. But honestly, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen starring Price.

Prospective viewers should think of this film as a western, albeit it takes place in South Africa. It's about an aged prospector (Price) and his beautiful but spunky daughter who live in a South African ghost town, the former site of a gold strike.

A band of bank-robbing scoundrels who suddenly find themselves in the harsh desert with no water drag into the town and neither Price nor the daughter want them there. Of course, the suspicions of the robbers are that the old man has made a new gold strike and is attempting to keep the treasure to himself.

Arguments break out amongst the robbers, alliances waver, and ultimately, a battle ensues for the booty. The nearby presence of a large band of African tribesmen, friendly to Price, serve to somewhat temper the robbers' all-out assault.

The cinematography of this film is first-class and the color saturation is just superb. The locations are equally great and the acting is spot-on.

I bought this film for a song (I see that it's currently still cheap, probably due to the thin cardboard packaging) thinking that it was likely just another second-rate movie.... not so! Yes, I loved Vincent Price in ""House on Haunted Hill"" a bit better than this one but, for western fans especially, this movie is clearly a secret treasure. Don't be put off by the discount packaging.",1202169600,,1593,4.736462093862816
7838681,5,6303102883,I had the same problem with this title. I hope Amazon can sort out this problem and make this fine movie available again.,1187654400,,121,4.304347826086956
7838682,4,6303102883,"I recall seeing the movie years ago.  It was a compelling story about corrupt border guards involved in smuggling illegal aliens into the United States.  Wilford Brimley actually played a secondary role; the true star (and a very nasty bad guy) was Gerald McRaney.  So I was thrilled to see it available on DVD.  Unfortunately, Amazon sent me the wrong movie--an older movie with the same title but very different story.  When they tried to correct the mistake, the movie I longed for was out-of-stock.  To add to my frustration, when I tried ordering it from another supplier on Amazon.com, the same error played out!  I would highly recommend the original movie, ""The Jackals"" starring Wilford Brimley and Gerald McRaney, but can offer no suggestions on where to buy it--I still haven't been able to get a copy!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Simon-Simon-Season-One/dp/B000GW8UAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Simon & Simon - Season One</a>",1185840000,,977,5.6506849315068495
