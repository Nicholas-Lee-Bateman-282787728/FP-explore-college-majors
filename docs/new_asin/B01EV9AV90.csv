8759615,2,B01EV9AV90,"The set up is a tiresomely familiar one. A curiously small group of teens in a very large delinquent facility wake up to find none if their adult supervisors in residence. Naturally they party hearty until the booze runs out after which they venture into town for more supplies. They soon discover that the adult population has turned into deformed, raving, homicidal maniacs due to some mysterious virus  in other words zombies in all but name. (Remember when zombies were passive walking dead, working in sugar cane factories, unless directed to malevolent purposes by their evil master?) What follows is the standard rambling about trying to find a safe-haven (that oddly doesnt include returning to the unmolested group home theyve vacated) and avoiding being offed by crazed grown-ups, their own who become affected because they're all on the verge of turning 18, and a gun-toting, trigger-happy prepubescent  who I seriously wanted to see meet a gruesome fate. No such luck on that score as this supposed horror effort is decidedly deficient in splatter. The emphasis is more on character  and well acted by a cast of young unknowns  than on carnage.
 It isn't very scary, either. Youd have to care about this collection of misfits to be concerned about what happens to them. Early on they reveal themselves to be concerned with nothing more than getting laid and getting high (flashbacks to their troubled pasts, caused by adults, don't somehow build the requisite sympathy). Once under attack their only concern is survival  presumably so they can get high and get laid. A few show signs of more mature attitudes as the film progresses, but thats also a signal they're about to turn. So is director Thierry Poiraud posing an allegory of some sort? And if so, of what precisely? Is the old Dont trust anyone over 30 now Dont trust anyone over 18? Is he  and scripter Marie Garel Weiss  saying that as we grow older we cast aside our optimistic dreams and continue to destroy our planet for future generations? I guess the case could be made for that but it appears to be just another low-budget zombie outing with a cast of unknowns (that cost an estimated 2,000,000  where did the money go?) and isn't terribly interesting. Horror completists will want to check it out but fair warning if you do: the thick regional accents are a challenge to the ear, so turn on the subtitles.",1536105600,,2385,4.825980392156863
8759616,3,B01EV9AV90,"Back in the 60s the youth in revolt had a saying, Never trust anyone over 30. The movie DONT GROW UP takes that thought, drops the age bracket down to 18 and adds zombies to the mix. What more fun could you expect than that as a premise?

A group of six teens at a juvenile detention center on an island in England, Bastian (Fergus Riordan), Pearl (Madeleine Kelly), Liam (McKell David), Shawn (Darren Evans), May (Natifa Mai) and Thomas (Diego Mendez), wake to find no adult supervisors in the building. One of them is about to turn 18 and they celebrate having fun seemingly being the only ones in charge of the place. But after a while the novelty of that wears off and they begin wondering where everyone is. To find out they leave the center and head to town.

What they discover surprises and shocks them. Something has gone terribly wrong and adults are now little more than psychotic killers driven mad by a virus that has them killing the children that they find. The only ones unaffected are young people like themselves who they find as they go through town. Deciding the safest thing to do is get off the island they head for the nearest sea port they can find.

Along the way they meet up with other survivors who are less than trusting, especially since a few of the group seem to be on the verge of becoming older and potentially infected. They also fall prey to attacks with one of them wounded early on and others taken out one by one. The question remains from the start, will any of them be able to survive and the nagging question of whether it is just the island or the entire world weighs heavy throughout.

The movie works on so many levels and for horror fans and especially those who love the zombie genre there is a lot to be enjoyed here. It also works as a metaphor for the problems teens face when confronted by adults as well as a coming of age film where reaching adulthood not only deprives you of your youth but of your sanity as well. Some adults would say that becoming an adult truly does result in loss of your mind.

For a movie like this to work you have to believe the actors in their portrayal of the situation theyve been thrown in. All involved here do an admirable job when it comes to that requirement. That some are older than the others with the potential of turning at a moments notice also works well with not only the performance on display but the threat that exists in the story as well.

The frightening aspect of an adult driven mad for whatever reason adds to the tension seen here. Adults are supposed to be the ones in charge, the protectors of the innocent. Here they are little more than killing machines seeking out the young. And these are not the lumbering zombies that weve seen in decades past but the fast running zombies that have some semblance of thought process still raging in their rabid frenzied minds. That only increases the fear factor here.

The further the group gets from town and the fewer the group dwindles down to decreases the pace of the film as it moves forward but it doesnt stop the story. Its still thought provoking and scary at moments, enough so to keep fans awake and watching. If this is the type of programming that Shudder, the streaming network responsible for the film, is presenting my guess is it will make fans of horror decide their monthly rate is worth investing in. If not at least fans can watch this film and enjoy a new twist on an old genre that is entertaining and frightening as well.",1531699200,,3494,4.424572317262831

8759619,3,B01EV9AV90,"Teens at the St. Madeline Youth center wake up and discover they have no adult supervision.  After breaking all the rules they opt to go to town only to find the streets empty...almost.  It seems adults have contracted a disease which causes them to go into a berserker mode as they kill each other.

Yes it reminded me of Star Trek ""Miri"" from the first season with Kim Darby and Michael J. Pollard.  Fergus Riordan and Madeleine Kelly  took the lead in a film with drama, killing, blood, and teen sex. In spite of all that promise, there was a desire for realism which toned down the entire film.
