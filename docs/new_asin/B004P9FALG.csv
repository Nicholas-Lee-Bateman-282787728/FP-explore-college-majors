8733084,3,B004P9FALG,"Interesting to watch, and there was a nice coverage of the trials and tribulations of launching BLAST via balloon. However, I felt the documentary lacked a clear explanation about what it was they were trying to accomplish or discover by launching BLAST, including what their results actually meant.",1530489600,,299,5.25

8733086,5,B004P9FALG,"Blast! details the six years of frustrating steps finally leading to the launch of a NASA astronomy balloon over Antarctica. (The balloon itself was meant to collect a picture of the universe in the submillimeter band, a wavelength unobtainable from earth's surface). The story follows failed launches and recoveries, equipment problems, and some of the personal interactions of the scientists. It's modern, it's fun, and it makes science ""cool"" without being ""Hollywoodized"". Excellent and highly recommended for showing to a high or middle school science class. Makes science look exciting, and very human.",1314921600,3,608,5.548387096774194
