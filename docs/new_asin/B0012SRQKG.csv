8247693,5,B0012SRQKG,"This 1998 edition of ED SULLIVAN'S ROCK-N-ROLL CLASSICS is two half-hour episodes of the syndicated best of Sullivan series. Jay Thomas narrates vintage film clip montages prior to each act.

This edition features two numbers from Elvis Presley's second Sullivan show gig and one from his third. He's shown full-figure in all his controversial hip-swinging glory for the first two. During the January '57 stint, per network censors ""E"" is seen only from the waist-up. Afterwards, Ed publicly called Elvis ""a real decent, fine boy,"" but off-mike he grumbled the expletive ""sumbtch."" Presley couldn't hear what was said and he thanked the mercurial emcee. E's manager, Col. Tom Parker made sure this demeaning telecast was the last Sullivan show appearance for his boy.

During a special r&b-flavored 1955 broadcast, Ed brought in as co-host WWRL deejay Tommy Smalls (aka ""Dr. Jive"") and he intros Bo Diddley, a performance cut short here. Fats Domino's and Jerry Lee Lewis' 2nd half songs are also edited. All others are ""live"" and full length.

Both shows feature Motown/Tamla/Gordy label stars. All segments are ""live."" The first Temptations tune is edited.

Besides having the poise and talent of a pro, Michael Jackson's hot fchsia felt hat shows that at age 11 he was already a sartorial marvel. After he and his brothers perform, Ed introduces their discoverer, Diana Ross. She acknowledges a cheering audience from her aisle seat.

During their meet-and-greet with the master of ceremonies, Four Tops lead singer Levi Stubbs tries without luck to teach Sullivan to boogaloo. Stevie Wonder wears the same bright blue jacket and tie for his 9/68 and 12/68 appearances.

In a unique on-location show, the Four Tops perform in a hospital ward for convalescing soldiers. Ed introduces the Bee Gees as three brothers from Manchester accompanied by two Aussie musicians. Steppenwolf vocalist John Kay sings live over the Top 40 record. In interviewing band members, Sullivan asks each for their favorite artists. One answers the Fgs, the strange East Village group, and Ed hears it as ""the Frogs"" and ""the Thugs.""

John Lennon forgets two lines of ""Help."" Paul and George cover for him. Because David Crosby argued with Ed's producer, this was the Byrds only Sullivan appearance. The same for the Doors, after Jim Morrison didn't change the line, ""Girl we couldn't get much higher,"" as agreed upon. The 4.5 minute Vanilla Fudge presentation may be the loudest ever Sullivan act. Carmen Appice is brilliant and although Mark Stein hams it up physically he is also flawless. The Airplane have an appropriately trippy video with lots of special effects.
