6979835,5,B00SC8KTHG,"COMEDY, drama, mystery  Preston Sturges Sullivans Travels has it all.

Joel McCrea, mostly known for Westerns like The Virginian and Ride the High Country, plays star Hollywood director John L. Sullivan. Set in the Depression, Sullivans owes his fame to comedy  and now he wants to make a film about homelessness and poverty in America. Studio heads try to talk him out of it  Sullivan has no experience with the darker side of life. So the good-hearted and, yes, nave filmmaker disguises himself as a hobo and sets out with only a dime in his pocket.

It takes Sullivan three attempts to get the experience he needs. In his first adventure, he meets a struggling starlet played by Veronica Lake. Lake is everything you've heard and more. Shes a beauty all right, but its her comic timing and chemistry with McCrea that drives the movie.

Sullivans Travels comes to us via Criterion, so we expect the best and we get it. The HD transfer and soundtrack are outstanding, if not precisely reference quality. The black-and-white film is sharp, with deep blacks, bright whites and progressive, solid gray tones. Look for a terrific use of shadow-play during a railroad scene filmed at night, where the comedy turns into a Hitchcockian thriller.

Criterion provides hours of outstanding extras, too, including a 2001 commentary by filmmakers Noah Baumback, Kenneth Bowser, Christopher Guest and Michael McKean. Ants in Your Pants of 1941, the title of one of Sullivans fictional films, is actually a new video essay from filmmaker David Cairns and director Bill Forsyth Gregorys Girl, who talk about the films energetic pace, sparkling dialogue and themes. (Sullivans proposed drama is, O Brother, Where Art Thou?  and we know who picked that up.)

Still, the 75 minute bio, Preston Sturges: The Rise and Fall of an American Dreamer made for PBS American Masters series is the best. American-born Sturges was carted off to Europe by his mother, Mary, throughout his childhood. He hated it. Mary was best friends with famed actress Isadora Duncan (she actually gave Duncan the scarf that resulted in her tragic accident) and, together, they hit all the classic theater, opera, ballet and symphony available. In the Sandy Sturges video interview with his widow, she attests that, while her husband would never listen to classical music and shunned theater arts, the background was there. He couldn't outrun his education.

Sturges is credited as the first writer to become a film director under an agreement with Paramount, paving the way for the likes of Joss Whedon, Wes Anderson and Christopher Nolan. He left the studio system to create a film company with none other than Howard Hughes  a handshake deal that soured badly, and Criterion lets us know how. We also hear the man himself, singing, reciting and doing a bit of PR with gossip columnist Hedda Hopper in archival audio selections.

Dont neglect the enclosed essay by Stuart Klawans, film critic for The Nation and author of Film Follies: The Cinema Out of Order. His analysis is dead-on, pointing out that slapstick sequences cant hold a candle to the humor of Sturges' dialogue, or that his examples of poverty, class and racial bias, and compassion teach us more than Sullivans message film ever could.

Sullivans Travels is dedicated to comedians and their art. Take the trip and find out why; you won't regret it.   Kay Reynolds",1429574400,11,3388,4.971681415929203
6979836,5,B00SC8KTHG,"I liked this 1941 drama/comedy a lot. It is deservedly considered a classic and it didn't age one bit. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

John L. Sullivan (Joel McCrea) is a director, known for light comedies. His films made him very rich, but he aspires to do something more serious. He ultimately comes with an idea for a drama about people living on the margins and in order to ""learn trouble first-hand"", disguises himself as a tramp and gets on the road, without a penny in his pocket, to the greatest despair and concern of his producer, his agent - and also his butler. In one of his first forays he meets a failed actress (Veronica Lake), who left Hollywood after some bad experience, pennyless and bitter. We never know her name - she is even credited simply as ""The Girl"". And then the film really begins.

The most important precision to give about this film is that it is definitely NOT a comedy or at least it is not only a comedy. It certainly has comic moments and there is romance and romantic comedy in it too - but there is also A LOT of drama in it, sometimes very, very tough. There is also social criticism in it, quite obviously, but also quite a lot of reflection, on poor people, rich people, on the (mis)understanding of poor people by the rich people, about the nature of poverty and also, last but not least, about arrogant pretention of highly educated intellectual progressive people who think that they understand the world better than anybody else - when in fact frequently they have not the slightest clue... In fact this film will probably enrage most of ""progressive"" left wingers...)))

Veronica Lake, one of the most beautiful women who ever lived, is at her most gorgeous in this film and she plays very well. The dialogs are strong and inetlligent, there are twists and shockers, there are adventures, there are heart-warming moments, there are moments which make us think (in fact think A LOT - especially in the last 10 minutes), there is an excellent speech with an analysis of poverty and ultimately SPOILER HERE it all ends well.

It is a very, very good film, which can be watched and re-watched. I loved it and I will definitely keep the DVD. ENJOY!",1444262400,,2219,4.610126582278481

6979844,5,B00SC8KTHG,"""Sullivan's Travel's""(1941) is considered by many film historians to be director Preston Sturges finest film. An escapist comedy about a Hollywood director known for making only lightweight comedies who now wants to make a socially responsible film about human suffering and hardship during Depression era America, holds up quite well today and contains many memorable sequences. Criterion has now released this film on Blu-ray and it's a vast improvement over the standard DVD that they released of the film in 2001. The video quality is very pleasing and Criterion has given the film a high Bitrate(35.01) which certainly improves the picture in all areas. According to the liner notes: ""This new high-definition transfer was created from a 35 mm nitrate fine-grain at Universal Studios where the film was restored"". The results of that restoration are very impressive and ""Sullivan's Travels"" has never looked better. The are no vertical lines, torn frames, dirt,  debris, etc. to the picture now that it is on Blu-ray. Blacks, whites and grays are very well balanced with a pleasing contrast throughout. Set designs, props, and costumes are very detailed now and certainly add to the viewing experience. The audio has been improved also. Again from the liner notes: ""The original monaural soundtrack was re-mastered at 24-bit from a 35 mm magnetic track made from the original 35 mm soundtrack negative"". There are no noise artifacts(hiss, pops, etc.) with dialogue and sounds being very clear. As far as the acting goes, it's easy to see how Veronica Lake became one of the biggest stars in the early Forties. Even without that ""peak-a-boo"" hairstyle of hers, anyone viewing the film even after seventy years will not be able to take their eyes off her. Although she and Joel McCrea did not get along during the filming they still make a great couple and have excellent chemistry on screen together. Paramount wanted to put the two of them in ""I Married a Witch""(1942) but McCrea rejected the idea(stating: ""Life's too short to make two films with Veronica Lake"") so they paired her with Fredric March instead.  The Sturges ""Stock Company"" of actors offer great support as they do in all of his films. ""Sullivan Travels"" is 90 minutes(Aspect Ratio: 1.37:1) and contains all of the commentaries and featurettes from the 2001 DVD including a 75 minute documentary on the life and career of Preston Sturges. Criterion has also included a six page informative booklet by film critic Stuart Klawans that tells all about the production of ""Sullivan's Travels"" and it's famous director. This is the second Preston Sturges film to be released by Criterion this year(following ""The Palm Beach Story"") and hopefully we'll get ""The Lady Eve"" sometime in the future. Until then, Criterion's new Blu-ray of ""Sullivan's Travels"" should be a welcome addition to any film library and comes highly recommended.",1429833600,12,2898,5.1118143459915615
6979845,5,B00SC8KTHG,"This new Blu-Ray transfer is a pleasant upgrade from the Criterion Collections previous DVD incarnation. While there is the occasional blemish, there is also plenty of detail with a sharp image that preserves the filmic qualities of Sullivans Travels.

Preston Sturges: The Rise and Fall of an American Dreamer is a fantastic documentary that originally aired on PBS American Masters series in 1990. It takes a look at Sturges life and career in great detail.

There is a 2001 interview with Sandy Sturges, author of Preston Sturges on Preston Sturges. She talks about the mans beginnings as a playwright and how that informed his views of Hollywood. She also touches upon his relationships with key Hollywood players, like Barbara Stanwyck and Joel McCrea.

New to this edition is a video essay entitled, Ants in Your Plants of 1941 by filmmakers David Cairns and Bill Forsyth that takes a look at the socio-political aspects of Sullivans Travels.

Also included is a short radio interview with Sturges originally broadcast in 1951.

There is a homemade recording that Sturges made of himself reciting Justin Huntly McCarthys poem, If I Were A King.

There is another homemade recording of Sturges singing My Love, which was a song he composed and appeared in two of his films, The Miracle of Morgans Creek (1944) and Hail the Conquering Hero (1944).

Finally, there is an audio commentary by filmmaker Noah Baumbach, Kenneth Bowser and actors Christopher Guest and Michael McKean, which is an amusingly affectionate appreciation of Sturges and his film.",1429574400,17,1555,5.0984251968503935

To see how things are going in the real world, he embarks on his trip as tramp in disguise only with 10 cents in his pocket. Seeing prisoners who are happily laughing at Disney animation, he finds himself in a miusunderstanding of what he has done and, eventually, becomes convinced the need of comedies he deems to be rubbish for people.

I really didn't see it coming.  Then the ""happy"" ending was a little rushed, hence the 4.5 stars instead of the full five.  Plus the two stars of the movie never got to kiss.  (Did they?  I don't think so).  And saving the best for last... Veronica Lake was HOT!  She had true sex appeal.  Speaking of which, watch carefully the scene at the pool when she's handling the brush and talking to McCrea's character.  Yeah.  That's the closest to a sex scene in the movie.  They had some strange standards back then (due to idiotic religious interference), but creativity can sometimes overcome stupidity.

8698076,5,B00SC8KTHG,"This CRITERION COLLECTION of the Preston Sturges movie SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS is about as good as it gets for movie historians and movie-viewing fans in general.  Every aspect of this release is quality; a complete edition to a 5 star rating.
The 1990 75 minute documentary The Rise and Fall of an American Dreamer (by PBS for American Masters Series) only stalls some when Preston Sturges' original comedic writing (and directing) Hollywood career crashed to an ostracized halt, leaving him stumbling around France and, eventually, the Algonquin Hotel until his sudden passing at 61.
But, getting to watch clips from other movies like Unfaithfully Yours (some believe ahead of its time; eventually remade with Dudley Moore and Nastassja Kinski!) Lady Eve (with Henry Fonda and Barb Stanwyck) as well as The Miracle at Morgan Creek has me considering another viewing (of these Preston Sturges 1940's original movies).  They should be better the second time.  There is also a 15 minute video essay with filmmaker Bill Forsyth (Gregory's Girl; Local Hero) that was more interesting than I expected.
As for watching SULLIVAN'S TRAVEL my crush on Veronica Lake is reconfirmed.  What a sassy lil' doll she was. Truly, she is someone from black-and-white era I just don't take my eyes off.  Seriously, I can't do it.  There is also a great tidbit in commentary (with Christopher Guest and Michael Mckean ... yes, from Spinal Tap fame ...) that reveals to us Veronica was 6 months pregnant during shoot and, Oh, that's why she was so heavily clothed and holding the purse et cetera and so on... Love the way they did her 'nude' showering scene, by the way.
If reading this you're probably already aware of SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS reputation but if you have not seen it yet, I would think it a safe bet any serious movie fan will agree this 1941 movie holds up well remaining a social and Hollywood satire that speaks volumes in relevancy, still, today.  SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS, really, to me, only had one screwball comedy, slapstick miss and that was the ""must Everyone get pulled into the swimming pool (gag)""?
But, SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS  is amusing even moreso with its dialogue:  ""You need me to go with you ... you don't know what you're doing, you can't even FIND trouble ... you can't even find your way OUT of Hollywood.""  Only makes real sense when Veronica Lake (simply called THE Girl) is talking to someone who is trying to live like a hobo to see how the poor live ... and is failing miserably ... right down to wannabe hobo's (Joel McCrea as Sullivan) developing a really bad head cold.
Like I said SULLIVAN""S TRAVELS is a satire on ""How the other half lives"" whether it's the poor (half) or about Hollywood's money making movie moguls making a movie ... within a (Sturges-Sullivan) movie!  It is not a mistake essays are written about the importance of SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS as well as becoming a film school viewing staple.  Smart, funny and, yes, serious to the point being made, yet, with it's simple-how-did-they-do-this-so-well with such an unpretentious message (in only 90 minutes)?
SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS O' Brother Where Art Thou references is truly one for the books.",1468454400,3,3162,4.889719626168224
8698077,5,B00SC8KTHG,"It is always interesting when the point of a film gives itself as its own example. That is the case in the film under review, premier 1930s and 1940s screwball comedy director Preston Sturgis Sullivans Travels where the final point to be made is that film, whatever else it may be, can be a vehicle to chase away an audiences blues, for a while. Then this film, not without some excess slapstick at the beginning, gives us many reasons to laugh and forget our troubles for a couple of hours. And that is these days, so you can imagine what it was like for audiences beleaguered by the seemingly never-ending Great Depression and the drums of war pounding in Europe.

Of course it takes that couple of hours to figure out that comedic films can bolster the human spirit, as surely if not better, that some social justice drama. At least it took one John L. Sullivan, a well-regarded comedy director out in the hinterlands of Hollywood played by boy-next-door Joel McCrea, that long to figure out what he had previously been doing was all for naught. A number of characters in the play from his producers lawyer to his world-weary valet try to tell Sullivan that the poor, the forgotten, the misbegotten, the fellahin of the world already know they are up against it, that the cards are stacked against them, know that short of a salutary revolution, an unlikely occurrence for a lot of reasons in America, they don't need to have their noses rubbed in that raw fact. Basically save the social concern dramas for the art houses and the intellectuals who hang there and leave the masses their moments of escape in a dark theater.

Heres how Brother Sullivan learned his lessons. Like I said John L. was sick unto death of comedy, wanted to do something meaty, that social drama mentioned earlier about the plight of the underclasses. Problem:  John L. was clueless about what made the working, and non-working poor, tick. How the scramble for necessities wore them out, made them too tired to pursue the finer things in life. Solution: John L. would hit the road, go among the brethren of the railroad jungles, breathe the same fetid air as the fellahin. New Problem: the film company knowing it has a valuable performer insisted on having him chaperoned. Not a good way to learn about the hobo life, and he bemoaned his plight for a while.
Making that plight a little easier is easy on the eyes was girl-next-door Veronica Lake as a girl (the Girl) he met in a roadside diner who had busted flat in Hollywood and was heading back to  Muncie, Lima, Buffalo or where she hailed from before she got stardust in her eyes. She decided to go on the road with him, for kicks, mainly, not knowing for a while that he that he was a famous director on the bum. One thing after another lead this pair to some serious down and out places, with plenty of poignant scenes of the life of the desperate poor, before they abandon that scene for the wilds of Hollywood.

Except as a parting gesture John L. decided he would go down to the jungle and pass out five dollar bills to the brethren. Here is what the down and out have to deal with which he had not factored into his gesture. Among the poor are the lumpen, the criminals who feed off of plight on the poor, the main daily enemy of the poor if you think about it (and a very good reason why the Paris Communards of 1871 put a sign death to thieves above their headquarters at the Hotel de Ville). So one guy bopped him on the head and took whatever dough he had, among other things, after putting him on a train going east. Showing such characters wind up with no good end the robber was run down by a train. Then things got a little dicey since one of the things he took was John L.s identification so everybody though he was dead. Worse the knock on the head left John L. punch drunk and he picked a fight with a railroad bull, not a good idea since he drew a six year sentence on the county and no good could come of that.

John L. took his lumps in the prison camp getting on the wrong side of a prison guard. But it was also there that he got religion about what comedy could do for the downtrodden after attending a movie shown at a black church. But he didn't want to make a career in the camp out of that knowledge so he got everybody riled up by saying that he had been the guy who killed John L. Sullivan. Presto all guns in Hollywood were headed east to retrieve the boy wonder, including that easy of the eyes girl. Yeah save the serious social and artistic stuff for the likes of Dalton Trumbo, Harold Clurman, John Steinbeck, and let boy wonder make people laugh. Got it.",1453680000,,4624,4.396028037383178
