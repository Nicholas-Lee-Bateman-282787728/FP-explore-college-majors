7831811,4,6302765218,"The fourth season of ""Northern Exposure"" opened with ""Northwest Passage"" (September 28, 1992), which refers to Maggie's depression over her 30th birthday as she becomes obsessed with the idea she is growing old and is missing out on life.  Joel, of course, provides no comfort whatsoever, so by way of a solution Maggie enacts an Indian ritual to put her past to rest.  Meanwhile, Maurice has commenced working on his memoirs and Marilyn has asked poor Chris to teach her how to drive.  Written by Robin Green, ""Northwest Passage"" was directed by Dean Parisot.  Nothing spectacular happens in this episode, which makes it an interesting choice for inclusion in this video collection, but it does give a nice character study of the M characters of Maggie, Maurice and Marilyn, which, obviously, is the point.  This one is for true fans of ""Northern Exposure,"" and not the casual viewer.",994204800,25,885,4.952702702702703

Meanwhile, back in Cicely, the ever pompous Maurice is driving everyone  crazy recording his memoirs and Chris ends up literally driving Marilynne  crazy as she takes driving lessons from him.  Marilyne decides to walk and  Joel saves Maggie and tenderly stays with her in the hospital with a kiss  on the forehead.  A sweet glimpse of things to come.....",957744000,19,708,4.776859504132231
