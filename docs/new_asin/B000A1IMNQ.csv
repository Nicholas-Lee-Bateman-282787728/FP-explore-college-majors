8072129,3,B000A1IMNQ,"The video quality was rather poor and my biggest complaint; everything seemed to have a reddish tint.  Very nice mix of women of ages, sizes and shapes.  Should be something for everyone.  I'd like to see more like this but maybe with a few younger ladies and demonstrations of different women's self-explorations.  Most of the women here were at least middle aged or a bit older... and maybe they could throw in a razor for the ladies to use as well.",1438300800,,451,4.530864197530864

8072131,4,B000A1IMNQ,"The bad news: this DVD appears to be a dub from VHS-quality video. The good news: it's so compelling that after the first few minutes, you won't care. Highly recommended!",1260057600,,170,4.7
8072132,4,B000A1IMNQ,"I say ""funny"" because a lot of the DVD was of several naked women laying around in a circle of the room masturbating themselves into a frenzy. This was the first time I'd seen something like this and while I don't consider myself a prude, this was a bit out there for me. BUT I think it was good in the sense of being ""outside of the box"" (lol... pun intended) and therefore helpful to see all these women being so comfortable with themselves that they can do this in the same room with those that support them. It was really quite beautiful in that way. Never felt inappropriate or twisted. Certainly not boring.

What I would have liked to see more of tho, was other ways of manually stimulating yourself other than the vibrator that they used. There was one other tool she introduced as well as a number of positions but I would have liked to see more information about the fundamentals of stimulation and the use of the finger rather than just the vibrator. She touched on breathing techniques but didn't actually incorporate them into the exercise when everyone was encouraged to explore and stimulate themselves. I think there could be much more value and exploration in that. Perhaps that is more appropriate for a one on one session??

I think she mentioned another DVD of hers that does show more one on one with several different clients... and I would be willing to shell out the money for that or at least look for it at the library.

I would recommend this DVD.",1240185600,4,1474,4.51310861423221
