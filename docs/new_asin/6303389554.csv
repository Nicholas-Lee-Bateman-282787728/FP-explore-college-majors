635598,4,6303389554,"Leni Riefenstahl, the iconic film maker, director, dancer and artist was a true and demanding artist whose work still inspires many today.  Born on 22 Aug 1902 she passed away on 8 Sept 2003 at the age of 101.  This documentary was filmed when she was 90-91 years old and gives a perspective into her life and work.  I personally found the documentary inspiring to continue pursuing my goals and continue my passion for diving and photography.  The film also reminded me how quickly people are to judge another from their perspective without taking into account the others perspective, culture, and circumstances.  My only criticism of this documentary was the commentary added, I believe by Nicole Front, as it really was not needed or useful.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in film, history, or Leni Riefenstahl.",1460678400,,828,4.963768115942029

635701,4,6303389554,"Riefenstahl was undoubtedly a brilliant filmmaker. Although Judith Thurman in her March 19, 2007 essay in ""The New Yorker"" observed that Riefenstahl relied heavily on clouds and other easy transitions, many of the scenes in ""Triumph of the Will"" and ""Olympia"" are immortal. I will put aside Thurman's other observation that these films are not composed entirely of unforgettable images, and that in those cases, the trailer was superior to the movie. Muller's film includes many examples where someone must have been filming Riefenstahl at work, common today when most big-budget Hollywood films are documented in this way, but unusual in the 1930s. We see the camera launched down a track by catapult to better follow a group of sprinters, the holes dug to film the pole vaulters, and the cameramen shooting supine from wagons for those incredible images of athletes from below, rendering them godlike. We learn of Riefenstahl's innovative use of multiple cameras, of her insistence on perfection. So from a technical and artistic standpoint, her position as ""the greatest female director"" is unassailable.

What is in doubt is her character and her responsibility for the regime she documented so exquisitely. Should we judge her more harshly than Sergei Eisenstein, whose talents served the Soviet regime? Why does Michelangelo get a pass for serving the Catholic Church during the Inquisition? Riefenstahl was no Shostakovich, fighting against evil while only pretending to acquiesce to it, at great personal cost. We are used to, or even expect, amorality among scientists - Werner von Braun was forgiven everything when he applied the knowledge he had gained in developing the V-2 to the American space program. Riefenstahl wanted to think of herself as an amoral, pure artist. She claims to be apolitical, and to never have heard of Hitler before meeting him. She says that she would have made the equivalent of ""Triumph of the Will"" for the Soviets or the Americans if she had been working in either of those countries. A patriotic German in love with the local scenery, she wants us to believe that Nazism was merely the environment within which she happened to find herself, that provided her the support she needed to realize her artistic vision. When she filmed ""Olympia"" in 1936, maybe she couldn't be faulted for not being able to predict the events of the next decade. Originally a dancer, she was clearly fascinated with the human body - the young, perfect, athletic, godlike human body.

Her initial reaction to Kristallnacht was that it could not have happened. Photographs exist showing her obviously distraught at the murder of Polish prisoners when she was a journalist during the Blitzkrieg. And she explains her gushing telegram of congratulations to Hitler upon the capture of Paris by claiming that she thought this meant the war was over and those ""terrible events"" would not be repeated.

But the war was not over then - it had barely begun. She claimed that she made ""Tiefland"" (supposedly, Hitler's favorite opera) because she could not stomach making another ""war movie."" When filming was moved to Bavaria, Roma and Sinti prisoners were brought in from a nearby concentration camp, because ""Mediterranean-looking"" extras were needed for a story taking place in Spain. Riefenstahl claimed to be unaware of this, dubious for such a perfectionist who maintained absolute control over every aspect of her filmmaking. She also claimed that all of the extras survived the war, despite some of them eventually being sent to Auschwitz. Up until the ""Tiefland"" section, I was willing to give Riefenstahl the benefit of the doubt, at least, to accuse her of nothing worse than depraved indifference. But she crossed a line in the use of slave labor. As the Earl of Oxford said in the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anonymous/dp/B0076D21O2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anonymous</a>, all art is political, otherwise, it would just be decoration. She deserved her place in the world of cinema, as the brilliant, talented, but unforgivably amoral and ultimately freakish oddity - the artist so oblivious to the implications of her work that she thought nothing of placing it in the service of ultimate evil.

She paid the price by never being allowed to make another film again, at least, not with outside financing. She went through a period of fascination with the Nuba, a relatively uncontacted tribe in southern Sudan. Her images from this period show her typical reverence for the young, athletic, godlike human body, that Susan Sontag called a ""fascist sensibility."" I'm not sure Sontag would have said that if the same images of the Nuba had been filmed by Frank Capra. Like listening to the music of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charles-Manson/dp/B0054MOULY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charles Manson</a>, the art is inseparable from the artist's notoriety.

As a documentary, Muller's presentation strikes a good balance between Riefenstahl's talking head, images from her films, and actual footage of her with Hitler, Goebbels, and the rest of that crew. Most of the film is in German, with English subtitles, but I would have preferred that the occasional and unobtrusive narration were subtitled as well. As an interviewer, Muller manages to both win his subject's confidence, while challenging her once in a while enough to get a rise out of her.

Riefenstahl's final project was underwater filming, with the assistance of her second husband Horst Kettner, 40 years her junior. To be fair, Riefenstahl was unusually well-preserved for her age - she obtained her scuba license at 70 by claiming to be 50, not hard to believe as when Muller filmed her at age 90, she looked about 70. The underwater project, filming sharks, rays, and cnidarians, is presented as her effort to escape the inevitable judgment of anything she might have done in the world of humans.

Finally, Muller asks her if she is ""sorry."" She responds that ""sorry"" is insufficient to atone for the events she was involved in, but she does express regret for ""Triumph of the Will."" She makes sure that we know she never joined the Nazi party or uttered a word of anti-Semitism. She is, in her own mind, responsible for nothing. She did not direct the crowds at the Nuremburg convention, but she did film them in such a way that no additional direction was required. In the end, her total lack of any moral sense whatsoever renders her art, however meaningful and influential, as nothing more than window-dressing on the dungheap of Nazi Germany.",1403136000,,6633,5.222535211267606
635702,4,6303389554,"The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl (Ray Muller, 1994)
[originally posted 2Nov2001]

First, let's get something straight. An artist's intentions are secondary, to say the least, to the intentions of the viewer. (That's how Jesse Helms can say ""I don't know what pornography is, but I know it when I see it,"" I can say the same thing, and both of us can be accurate despite having thoroughly different subsets of what constitutes pornography in our heads.) That said, the ""is/was Leni Riefenstahl a Nazi?"" question is quite simply irrelevant all the way around, and is hereby dispensed with.

Ray Muller, on the other hand, would have been lax in his task had he let it go so quickly. His three-hour documentary would probably have been an hour shorter, but the American obsession with the private lives of our stars wouldn't have been satisfied, and it is this prurience, in part, that makes The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl such an excellent way to spend three hours. Riefenstahl herself, who was over ninety at the time this documentary was made, is just as charming and magnetic as ever. Her deep love of filmmaking comes out in everything she does; for example, Muller takes her to a spot where we can see one of the rock faces featured prominently in her film The Magic Mountain, and she can describe shot by shot exactly how various scenes were filmed over half a century ago. It is not just the archival value that makes this worth watching, but the contagious enthusiasm Riefenstahl shows. As well, as one of a rapidly-dwindling number of people who lived through World War II, her impressions of it are often fascinating, even when (especially when?) they're at odds with the contemporary reporting of events.

All in all, a wonderfully absorbing piece of work for both Riefenstahl fans and critics alike, and even, despite the length, an excellent introduction to Riefenstahl herself. Highly recommended. ****",1396137600,,1948,4.932926829268292

And now for this production(leaving out poor Leni) It is a wonderful production and available at my friends AMAZON. The quality is excellent and it was great to see the old cameramen who had worked with Leni those many years ago. The underwater shots were terriffic,albeit leaving out the propaganda cutaways.

It is a shocking revelation to see how Hilter was perceived in 1934, not just in Germany, but by political leaders around the world. Unfortunately, the larva grew into a wasp...and the reputation of the woman who helped to document his rise to power was tarnished forever. This is an unforgettable film about an astonishingly resiliant woman. After seeing it, you will never watch TV footage of a political rally in quite the same way again.

635839,5,6303389554,"Wonderful Horrible World Of Leni Riefenstahl (1993) documentary is about an amazing woman and a great artist.

The Wonderful Horrible World Of Leni Riefenstahl (1993) documentary was filmed with actress, dancer, movie director, photographer Leni Riefenstahl's permission, participation, and help (she supplied many examples of her movies, still photos, and other important memorabilia to the producer of the movie, Ron Muller).

She was 90 years old when the movie was made in 1993, and was then in amazingly good health both physically and mentally. She dressed herself in attractive, stylish clothes and had attractively colored (ash blonde) and styled hair at a level of handsomeness never seen on most 90 year old persons of either gender. In her youth (the 1920's) she was a stage and movie actress and dancer famous for her attractive, shapely, sensuous legs.

We see those same legs displayed bare, still shapely and attractive, in a scene toward the end of this documentary where she sits on a bed with her boyfriend ""Horst"" (40 years younger than she, and by then her ""companion"" and protg of 18 years at least), watching beautiful underwater video camera-work they both did...a scene where Leni actually caresses the huge back of an unresisting Giant Manta Sting Ray with a body at least four feet in diameter, and a deadly ""sting"" tail which could easily kill any diver or other person unlucky enough to touch the tail.

Leni Riefenstahl (1903 - 2004) died at age 101 following an incredible life as a performing and photographic artist which continued literally until the year she died. She never ""retired,"" quit, or ceased her artistic activity or the promotion and publicity of that activity.

The Wonderful Horrible World Of Leni Riefenstahl (1993) documentary by Ron Muller was made with Leni's full cooperation and participation (and possibly co-ownership) and made intentionally dramatic and riveting because Riefenstahl knew the importance of publicity and keeping her name in the public eye, and examples of her work provided for mass public attention.

Much of what she did over her life was done with her own money and resources. She was an owner as well as a hired artist, and a very prosperous person thanks to her business acumen and abilities.

She owned both the famous Trimph Of The Will (1934) documentary depiction of the 1934 Nuremburg Germany Nazi Party three day outdoor rally and gathering, and also owned the Olympia (1936) documentary about the World Olympic Games For 1936 held that year in Munich, Germany.

After World War II and the defeat of Germany, she moved to insist on legal and financial control of both those important (landmark) documentary movies, and money she obtained due to her control of the two famous documentaries (and also of feature movies she acted and danced in done before 1934, both sound and silent movies of fame and great art and skill) was used to fund further artistic, photographic and underwater video projects she continued to work on through her ninth decade.

Leni Riefenstahl (1903-2004) was a remarkable woman, and this documentary portrait of her is worth screening over and over again.

She is a role model for all women, and all performing and photographic/ cinematic artists of all ages, and in all countries.

Leni R. was, according to whom you believe, Hitler's favorite film maker.  Was she also a propagandist? That's up to you to decide. French courts after WW II wouldn't convict her of anything more than being misguided fool. But Hitler and Goebbels loved her films. Just because they were well-made?
There are all these great questions that I'm sure will be debated for a long time. Was she a great artist, a film maker ahead of her time? I think there isn't that much debate on that topic. She was also an egotist (a requirement of great artists?) and had an almost pathological lying ability.  Why did she have removed the names of her Jewish collaborators from her pre-Hitler films and then say she had no problems working with Jewish artists?  It boggles the mind how she could have been so surprised by the Jewish boycotts during her mid-1930s American tour.
That's our wonderful and horrible Leni.
The video is just excellent. The viewer can see how Leni tries to take control of the film! What biographer ever had such a subject? Fascinating!",1321488000,,1209,4.693396226415095
635842,5,6303389554,"Mesmerizing documentary about controversial German filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl.  Rightly called the most famous female director of all time, she is also the most infamous of either gender.

Director Ray Muller traces her career from actress/dancer in post-World War I Germany, through the years working with Hitler and the Nazi party, up to the1990's.  Riefenstahl is an intriguing, enigmatic figure.  Time and again Muller tries to pin her down on the subject of her complicity with Hitler and the horrors of the Third Reich.  She adroitly sidesteps the issue every time, preferring to focus on her art rather than her politics.

And what art it was!  Widely viewed as one of the greatest directors of the  1930's, and indeed of all time, she created two of the most extraordinary documentaries ever made.  First is the terrible ""Triumph of the Will"", chronicling the 1934 Nazi Party Congress.  It is viewed as the greatest piece of propaganda in the history of cinema.  Far less controversial is ""Olympia"", in which she magnificently captures the athleticism of the 1936 Olympic Games, while pioneering techniques still in use in contemporary sports photography.

But most fascinating is Riefenstahl herself, arguing with Muller about how his film should be shot, and remembering with clarity how her incredible films were made, more than 50 years after she created them.

Muller maintains an ambivalent attitude toward his subject, neither condemning nor excusing her for her behavior.  Willing tool of Hitler, or opportunist using him to advance her career, Muller leaves it for the viewer to decide.",1318032000,,1603,5.2109375
635843,5,6303389554,"I was ignorant to the career of Leni Riefenstahl, and approached this 3 hour documentary about Hitler's favorite filmmaker with trepidation. Indeed, it didn't take long to figure out what was going on, and I am of the opinion that Leni Riefenstahl was an artist who was born to create, regardless of the subject; she made ""Triumph of the Will"" for the money and a breakout chance in her budding film career. It's amusing and entertaining that director Ray Mller gets pushed around and challenged, regarding art and politics, by the feisty 90 year old Leni, who's life must have been hell in her later years, forbidden to further pursue her art. Leni is powerful in these interviews, wistful about her place in the world of film, so sadly regretful about her bad decisions. (Hitler hated her ""Olympia"" film, but didn't stop her from making it). I learned a lot from this doc, and that's what qualifies it as an important piece, at least to me. I do believe that Leni was a victim, but the film explores so much more, especially her acting career, and future endeavors, minimal as they were.  It's definitely not a ""pity party"" for poor Leni; rather a controlled and concise telling of an artist who was more involved with the presentation of a subject, rather that the subject itself. Any good artist has a tale to be told. Leni's tale is simple, straightforward and without unnecessary prejudice. I admire Leni's art, and can only believe this passionate woman's belief that she did it for art. Vissi d'Arte, indeed. I especially enjoyed Leni telling Mller that his camera angles were all wrong.",1312848000,,1595,4.758122743682311
635844,5,6303389554,"I've had this on vhs and dvd, and the documentary is very good, produced about 1993 when Leni Riefenstahl was ninety years old.  Her works were villified, as was she herself, like the young woman in ""The Blue Light"".  She understood film making back then so well, that by the time she got around to Triumph of the Will, it turned out as a real masterpiece, like Olympia several years later.  Wow, when you see the documentary, you find out that she would break out in tears over things, like if someone was messing up her film schedule, or if she was really deep into a film subject and it wasn't going right.  Then there is a photo of her in tears when she went into Poland on the invasion in 1939 when she saw mistreatement of civilians, where she supposedly protested to Adolph Hitler who basically told her to leave his presence or something similar.
I don't believe she would have had a directing career or acting career in American Hollywood in the thirties if she had left Germany, she was older by then, not so pretty, and they had the 1934 film codes that forbade even woman portraying doctors or lawyers.  Its too bad she got associated with Nazi's which ruined her career, but hey, nazism and communism are so virulent that people are afraid of catching the germ of those who might have it.",1299283200,,1301,4.472573839662447
635845,5,6303389554,"Here's what I just wrote a friend after viewing this wonderful documentary:

""I highly recommend it. She was a piece of work, and the more I watch her the more I am persuaded she was probably being 90% truthful. Her consumption by artistry and fame utterly dulled her common sense at several points in the thirties -- though she used common sense to respond to some probing questions that needed better answers. A fanatic with great beauty and unbelievable energy focused somewhere out in a Wagnerian netherland. In romantic heat....for guys, lenses, mountains, anything that seemed lyrical in an odd way. Hitler fascinated her not because he was going to fix Germany, but because he was hypnotic and in his own way, lyrical -- the voice, the rhythms, the gestures. Well, she paid the price. Drove Goebbels nuts and almost broke at the same time. Not only a great artist, but one hell of a lucky manipulator, doubtless saved at times by things we don't know. Oh, and I think Susan Sontag got it wrong about her art being 'fascistic'. Bold, focus on strength and muscle yes. But to apply that characteristic to her would require it be applied to a hell of a lot that came out of Russia in those days.

If you haven't seen it, she filmed an underwater scene with some kind of huge ray fish with a tail that would have killed anything it touched. The animal was dangerous, but she manged to get  on top of it and pet it while Horst (who eventually married her when she turned 98 -- he being 40 years younger) filmed away, doubtless in terror. His gravy train on top of a ray with a squirmy tail.""

The film itself is fine. Muller is an excellent interviewer and pulls no punches as far as I can tell. Leni surely did, but at the end of the day she remains both fascinating and one of the great artists of the 20th century. To watch Olympia or Triumph of the Will is to be utterly run over by the technique, and, yes, lyricism. Good thing they never turned her loose in Red Square or North Korea with color film....Oh, and her work does give us a fantastic opportunity to get an up close and utterly terrifying look at the Nazis. I hope we can turn such a camera on the nutcase politicians making so much noise in this country now.",1297555200,,2227,4.424390243902439

This film shows that even at the age of 91 the dancer/actress/filmmaker was still a highly skilled actress . . . in her usual role as a politically naive and politically disinterested but passionate filmmaker.  The most astonishing moment of  movie is when she inadvertently slips out of character while enthusiastically discussing her filmmaking and gives us a brief glimpse of her genuine self, excitedly reminiscing about her interactions with the leaders of the Nazi party.  It is only a few seconds in a three-hour film, but it is an extraordinarily revealing few seconds!",1286841600,,710,5.094827586206897
635847,5,6303389554,"When I put this movie on, frankly, I expected to see an evil Nazi supporter who made the most successful propaganda movie of all time.  That's what the hype suggested.

But that's NOT what I saw.

What I saw was a genius, an artist, a tremendously articulate woman who was devoted to her art and got caught in a political trap like millions of others and, in the end, was vilified for basically NOT being political at all.  The filmmaker asks her ""Don't you think it's the duty of an artist to be politically aware?""  What nonsense! It was disgusting to see the filmmakers attempt to further vilify Leni with slimy trick questions like ""Have you stopped beating your wife?"".  Fortunately, they failed.  In every case, Leni's sincerity and honesty and self-examination and the way she articulated what actually went on in her mind and her immediate environment shone through as truth in the face of the obvious disrespect and manipulation of the filmmakers.

I was extremely irritated by the repeated attempts of the filmmakers to draw her into politics when it was clear that all Leni wanted to do in her life was make good, artistic films and was simply doing so in a time and a place where she would have been damned if she did and damned if she didn't.  As another reviewer points out, ""Why were the likes Richard Strauss and Karajan welcomed back into the fold and Riefenstahl wasn't? She was a woman, that's why. Haven't women always been pilloried for things that men are forgiven, excused and rehabilitated?""

The film maker tries to make a big deal out of Leni's declaration that she was NOT friendly with Goebbels and his diary entries where he claimed she was.  Anybody with a smidgen of psychological knowledge can see that Goebbels wrote his diary as a fantasy, not as fact.  As Leni pointed out, he was a master of the lie!  Leni's version has the ring of truth.  Goebbels was a disgusting little man and anyone who knows his history knows that what Leni says about him describes him accurately.

It strikes me that trying to lay responsibility for the events of Nazi Germany on Leni is just shameful.  Imagine yourself in her world, at that time and that place, and tell me truthfully that you would have done different.  You wouldn't.  Why?  Because if you aren't doing anything to resist the current Fascist takeover of the planet, which is a lot more obvious now that we have the example of the Hitler Reich to compare it to, then you have no excuse.  Leni had no such example from history that would help her to know that Hitler and all he stood for was a recipe for disaster.  Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.

As they say, hindsight is 20/20.  Leni herself says that what she learned about Hitler after the war was over has affected the whole rest of her life.  And not just because she was black-balled, but because the horror was so shocking she has never recovered from it.  She plainly says that you face either living with that knowledge or dying, and you face that choice every day.  She obviously chose to continue living, but it is obvious that it came at a great cost.  But there is no bitterness.

One other point: Leni has been vilified for making ""Triumph of the Will.""  She explains everything about this to the viewer and it all makes perfect sense considering what we now know about Nazi Germany and what we know about pathology in politics.  What Leni actually did was make a fantastic film that shows us as clearly as anything ever could exactly how  anyone and everyone can be deceived by psychopaths in power.  She didn't stage or control what was being filmed, she just recorded it and used her genius to edit the film into art. It is thanks to her that we have a record of that time and those events.  This film should be watched by everyone so that they can be aware of how pathological people in power can deceive so many people.  In fact, there is a strong resemblance between the followers of Hitler and those who supported George Bush and now, Barack Obama.  Leni's film is a lesson from history that should be taken onboard along with the reading of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Political-Ponerology-A-Science-on-the-Nature-of-Evil-Adjusted-for-Political-Purposes/dp/1897244258/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Political Ponerology (A Science on the Nature of Evil Adjusted for Political Purposes)</a>

If you want to see some really sick propaganda films, just watch American movies or fake news and lying journalism on TV every night.  Remember that Project Mockingbird was a program to place the CIA in control of journalism. In fact, I would suggest that the makers of this film were trying to create propaganda against Leni.

I'm pretty disgusted with the people making this film and their transparent efforts to corner, pigeonhole, defame Leni.  Throughout the film, her honesty and rational answers makes them look petty and pathetic and agenda driven.

If you are interested in Nazi Germany, in film making, in women's issues, this is definitely a film for you.  I give it five stars for Leni, not for the filmmakers.  She's the star and what a star she is!  This is a fascinating film simply due to her presence, her amazing self.  The world really lost a great artist for humanity when they sidelined Leni.",1275177600,,5319,4.804180418041804

Anyhow, the film is just that, a documentary on the extraordinary life of Leni Riefenstahl.  I thought the film was tremendous and really left me thinking:  what an amazing life some people end up living!  The documentary chronicles Riefenstahl's life from unknown dancer, to highly successful German actress, to photographer and filmmaker, to a Nazi 'vendor' or 'collaborator' for the truly cynical, to retiree and underwater photographer.  Truly amazing.  During the Olympic Games this past summer in Beijing I noticed that the local electronics and media store was pushing Riefenstahl's 'Olympia' film and that spurred me into looking for a Riefenstahl documentary.

635951,5,6303389554,"I had no knowledge of Leni Riefenstahl, her social/political significance in society or why she was so controversial until this aired on PBS, in 1994.  Riefenstahl, best known for directing two infamous documentaries, THE TRIUMPH OF THE WILL and OLYMPIAD, that sympathetically depicted the Nazi party.  Riefenstahl, born in Berlin, began as an interpretive dancer, a movie star, a mountain climber and then a filmmaker.

What was my perception of Len Riefenstahl?  I think that she was an incredibly charismatic individual (even at the age of 90, when the film was made).  I felt a little sick when they were discussing the Nazis, and her part in (her words) unknowingly glorifying the party's beliefs.  I am not sure if I was convinced of that at all.  However, this is a very important film that takes a look at the body of work of a very prolific, independent and fiesty woman who stood on her own two feet, up until the very end of her life.",1168732800,,945,4.6909090909090905
635952,5,6303389554,"It has always irritated me to no visible end that people, to this day, blame Ms. Riefenstahl for Nazism.  It shows how people can be so narrow minded as to lay the blame of a horrifying political movement at the feet of an artist.  Richard Wagner also gets blamed for Nazism as well, but that's another review.  Leni is one of the few female film directors who has a great visual style (which is used to great effect, and horrifying effect, in Triumph of the Will).  Her film Olympia is still amongst the greatest sports documentaries ever made.  The techinques she uses are still used by TV sports directors today.  In this film, we see a 90 year old Leni Riefenstahl, who is as tenancious, vivacious, and as combative as ever.  Leni is the most beautiful 90 year old woman I have ever seen, personally.  She talks passionately about her work, and remembers the filming of the 1936 Olymipics and the Nuremberg rally as if it was only yesterday.  I think she is a great artist, and it is ridiculously narrow minded to blame her for the Nazis.  It is always easy to blame an artist for society's ills.  This usually shows the stupidity of politicians more than anything else.  Yes, she was associated with Hitler, one of the world's most heinous dictators, but that shouldn't dismiss her contribution to cinematic art.  At the time of this film, Leni was scuba diving, engaging in underwater photography, and had a male companion/boyfriend a third of her age.  Despite her age, she was incredibly active, and I think that's fantastic.  She is a great artist, period.",1168128000,,1565,4.660583941605839
635953,5,6303389554,We'll probably never know if she was a nazi collaborator or just an artist who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  All that I know is she was quite a hotty in her silent films.,1131753600,,183,3.8157894736842106
635954,5,6303389554,"The question of 'controversy' inevitably comes up in this film. As a film maker for the Nazi Party, wasn't Riefenstahl equally guilty for the crimes of that regime? So Ray Muller tentatively asks Riefenstahl, so too do contemporary viewers of the 21st century.

This is an ahistorical attitude, typically made by people with no understanding of history (and no interest in it) and who have a simple minded view of the function of art (that it makes people do things they wouldn't ordinarily do). We have all been educated to abhor the Nazis. But this condemnation of Riefenstahl is witch hunting and itself has fascist overtones.

What was it like at the time, the 1930s in Germany? Riefenstahl effectively answers the charge. She says, correctly, that at the time she worked for Hitler the Nazi Party was seen as the saviour of Germany. Hitler was widely popular, not just in Germany but in both England and America. The discovery that he was a 'monster' and a war criminal was revealed by the Nuremberg Trials in the late 40s, and it has been promulgated ever since as anti Nazi propaganda. Riefenstahl was tried and exonerated by the Nuremberg commission, but has nevertheless been punished all her life, her right to film denied, her reputation tarnished. Courts mught need them, but public opinion has no need of proofs.

Riefenstahl impressed me in this film as a great intelligence, wiser by far than those who criticised her. Atrocities in war have been committed by all countries, and as citizens we all have moral complicity in these outrages to humanity. Does anybody remember the story about the woman taken in adultery, about those without sin throwing the first stone? (this comment a good Zen koan by the way).

Riefenstahl, most importantly, is a great film maker, one of the greatest. Seeing her and her team reminisce about how their films were made is to see people who have had an enormous influence on the lives of all who watch films today. Riefenstahl's comments and responses showed her as someone who could see around the questions in which her critics were bogged down. The film is a valuable presentation of an individual who could be correctly described as a genius. There is no denying the impressiveness of the woman, just as an interviewee. The fact that she taught herself to act, and to direct, inventing many staple technologies and techniques of the industry as she went on, puts her on a level with someone like D W Griffiths (interestingly, Griffiths has been tarred and feathered as a white supremist because he concurred in the beliefs expressed in Birth of a Nation). Denied access to film making (to the world's great loss) it is almost not surprising that Riefenstahl went on to be one of the world's greatest photographers, active till her 90s. Muller's film is an immensely valuable record of an extraordinary person.",1129248000,,2861,4.85655737704918
635955,5,6303389554,"What can you say about a woman who pretty much invented modern motion picture sports photography, made the most powerful propaganda film in history, climbed mountains in her bare feet, reinvented herself a couple of times, lied about her age in order to get SCUBA certified at 70, and lived to a feisty age of 101.

I've known about Leni Riefenstahl's films for all of my adult life, but this was all new stuff to my wife when we got married a few years ago. When I showed her this DVD, she was absolutely entranced.

Rather than get caught up in the ""was she or wasn't she"" debate over Riefenstahl's association with Hitler and the Nazi Party, my wife - a strong woman in her own right - saw Riefenstahl as a shining example of the liberated woman. Riefenstahl followed her creative passion wherever it led. For her, there were no gender barriers.

Had she emigrated to Hollywood with Marlene Dietrich, she may well have gotten lost in the constellation of American film stars. On the narrower stage of German film, she was a colossal talent as an actress and as a director.

Yes, she lent her talent and creativity to one of the most hideously evil regimes in history. How she really felt about it in her heart of hearts, we'll never know. It's clear she regretted making Triumph of the Will because it made her an outcast in the post-war film world.

The difficulty here is to separate the art from the politics. Before the war, Triumph of the Will won international acclaim, even from the French. Olympia, tinged as it is with its background of Nazi symbols, gave us sports camera techniques that haven't been improved upon since the film was made. Whenever you see footage of Jesse Owens' gold medal performances, you have Riefenstahl to thank for it.

Leni Riefenstahl, for all her bad judgment and Nazi connections, was one of the most powerful creative forces in the history of cinema.

This documentary bears repeated viewing because of the complexity of its subject and the impact of her work.",1111104000,,2003,4.657223796033994
635956,5,6303389554,"...this remains an important and gripping documentary!

It's difficult to describe the amazing power of Leni Riefenstahl's persuasive personality, yet Muller has beautifully managed to create and capture 3+ hours of intensely compelling documentary. It is beautifully preserved on this DVD, which unfortunately offers no special features.

Director and Subject are both fascinating. Since a decade has passed since the late Leni Riefenstahl was interviewed for this opus, it would be great to have had a bonus commentary track or an ""update"" featurette.

Having had the unique opportunity to correspond with both artists, I am impressed and awed by this documentary's ability to present a fair and balanced portrait of one of the most (if not THE MOST) controversial filmmakers of the 20th Century.",1099785600,,798,5.419354838709677
635957,4,6303389554,"Leni Riefenstahl was 90 years old when this documentary was made and she was more active than your average 60 year-old.  It begins with her scuba diving and shooting a film about the underseas.  The documentary mostly takes the middle ground and Leni tells the interviewers that she was never political and shot her Nazi films because she was an artist that Germany was her country.  She admits being friendly with Hitler but becomes incensed when the interviewers ask her about Goebbels.  She refuses to acknowledge any kind of relationship except to say that he came on to her and she rejected him.  The interviewers then read from Goebbel's diary that suggests a good friendship between the two.  It's an interesting moment in the film because you realize that no matter how sharp Riefenstahl is she cannot hide the whole truth.
Her best moment is when she compares her life to the lives of communist artists like Eisenstein who made pro-Soviet films.  That this contradiction isn't explored more in the documentary is a shame. Riefenstahl it could be argued helped strengthen the Nazi cause which probably led to more deaths, but the same could also be said for Eisenstein who has all but escaped such scrutiny.  You realize that the anger against her is less about the people who died because of her actions and more about the selective enforcement of morality in such circumstances.  We're supposed to hate Hitler because of the death camps, but we don't have to hate Stalin for the death camps.  Eisenstein was an idealist, but Riefenstahl was a cynic.
There are some great moments from her days as an actress and director, but even more interesting is the interspersed footage of the documentarians working to make this film and getting flak from Riefenstahl the whole way.  Like a typical Nazi she was trying to take over the production, complaining about how she should be shot and where.  You can enjoy this film as a document of history, politics or even film heritage.  If you like of those choices, you should see it.",1070496000,,2031,4.801724137931035

The film has a few unconfortable moments such as a telegram where she congratulates Hitler for his ""visit"" to France in 1940. Of course there are many questions unanswered. Maybe the worst thing that can be pointed at her is that she was blind. but... wasn't everybody?
But yet, I cannot judge her nor blame her. She did do some of the greatest films ever made. Maybe she was a nazi sympathizer... but then again... wasn't everybody then?
Seeing her talking about her films it seems clear to me that all she ever took interest for were the films. She never for a moment says anything that contradicts her passion for her work.
People accuse her aesthetic of being facist. I'm no so sure.
All that I am saying is this: History is too complex for a bipolar view. This documentary shows us her portrait through a century of the worst and the best moments. She seems to be haunted by having done her films... and being at the wrong time on the wrong place... maybe she is true.",1063756800,,1121,4.368421052631579
636049,4,6303389554,"Since Leni Riefenstahl has just turned 100, I thought it would be well worth taking a second look at her remarkable life.  Undoubtably a lot of people will be doing the same with the release of her new film (her first in nearly six decades) and the recent lawsuit filed against her by gypsy holocaust survivors.
Leni Riefenstahl was born in Berlin, Germany in 1902.  She started off her career as a dancer, and later as an actress in silent films.  She gained attention acting in mountain-adventure-type films.  The ever ambitious Riefenstahl then moved into directing.  When Hitler came to power, unlike many other people, Riefenstahl decided to stay in Germany and ""cosy up"" to Hitler and the Nazis.  Although she was never a Nazi party member herself, her work was hardly apolitical as she would like us to believe.
Riefenstahl made the infamous documentary/propaganda film ""Triumph of the Will"".  This film was a record of the Nazi Nuremberg rallies of 1934.  Thanks to Riefenstahl's stunning direction and camera angles, Riefenstahl managed to transform a regime of murderous fascists into benign saviors of Depression ravaged Germany.  To date, this film is considered to be the greatest propaganda film ever made, its techniques having influenced countless other films.  Riefenstahl followed her work with ""Olympia"", another stunning film, this time a record of the 1936 Berlin Olympics.  This film depicted the German athletes as a superior Aryan race which Riefenstahl compares to the ancient Greeks.
After World War II, Riefenstahl found herself blacklisted by the West German government and condemned by the world.  Despite loudly complaining that she was no Nazi pawn, Riefenstahl found herself, until recently, unable to direct another film.  Undaunted, she took up photography.  She also took up waterdiving where she photographs underwater marine life.
I found it fascinating and quite disturbing to listen to her account of her work for Hitler under the Third Reich.  When it comes to accusations of complicity with the Nazis, her response seems to be deny, deny, deny.  She claims that she knew about the Nazis' treatment of the Jews, but stayed in Germany to fight anti-semitism (which she never did).  She claims that because her films have no anti-semitism in them, they are not propoganda.  To me, this sounds like a pretty weak protest considering her films that glorify Nazis.  Riefenstahl also claims that she was not pro-Nazi because she was not a Nazi party member.  Another weak excuse.  I notice too that although Riefenstahl claims to be sorry that she made her films, she then immediatly demands to know what it is she has done.  The very fact that she cannot answer that question is disturbing.
I found it interesting how she responds when the director, Ray Muller, catches her in a lie.  She claims she was not close to Hitler and Goebbels.  Then, when Ray Muller presents her with evidence to the contrary (Goebbels' diary), she goes beserk.  Riefenstahl also denies using Gypsies from a local concentration camp in one of her films.  This despite the fact that the evidence is indisputable.  I'll be very interested in seeing how this lawsuit turns out.
I was also fascinated to see how she behaves when she thinks she is off-camera.  In one scene, she practically takes over directing in one shot of her in the mountains in order to assure quality.  In another scene, she criticizes her colleague for not holding the camera steady while filming underwater.  Riefenstahl displays a great deal of passion and, (dare I say it?), ruthlessness towards her craft.
Muller doesn't forget to include her post-war career as a photographer in Africa.  In this field she also excels, taking pictures of an isolated African community during a dancing ritual.  Her photographs are eerily similar to some of the shots in her films.  Her work in underwater photography is dazzling.  I'd be very interested in seeing her new film, ""Underwater Impressions"" to see how that holds up with the rest of her work.
Riefenstahl is undeniably a very talented artist and filmmaker.  Her place in history is secure.  However, her role during the Third Reich will haunt her to her grave.  Those hoping to see a glorified account of Riefenstahl's life will be disappointed, but those expecting to see a detailed unbiased look at Riefenstahl could do no better than to watch this film.",1030492800,,4389,5.0041379310344825
636050,5,6303389554,"Leni Riefenstahl, arguably the greatest film-maker yet to fully embrace the potential of medium, suffers through moronic interviews and offers us a glimpse into the mind and development of an artistic genius. One need only view ""Triumph of the Will"" and ""Olympia"" in totality to recognize that this lady set the standard for what film can be, but rarely ever is, yet she only thought herself to be a mere craftsman. Hitchcock, Kubrick and Welles should be such craftsmen and perhaps were, but this woman was the first genius of film. To see her sit at age 91 in front of a primitive editing machine and show us how she worked is worth the price of this DVD alone. It is as if we could watch Picasso show us how he painted or Mozart show us how he composed.
Forget the revisionist history about her ""Nazi sympathizing""; the world fawned over her films when they initially premiered in 1935 and 1936. The French and English gave both films their highest honor and the American critics tripped over themselves in lavishing rare and incredible praise, using such adjectives as ""brilliant"" and ""genius"". It was only after Hitler's descent into evil that we accused Reisenstahl of collaboration. We conviently forgot that in the years she made those films, we, too, were applauding the great German economic recovery.
What a life! A dancer in her teens, a film star in her twenties, the greatest film-maker of that or any time, a pariah to ease the guilt of the world which praised her, a chronicler of Nubian granduer in Africa and a brilliant underwater photographer in her nineties - Leni Reifenstahl lived a life that fiction couldn't create.
The short-comings of the interviewer aside, this is a rare oppurtunity to observe and listen to one of the two most influential women of the 20th century, the other being Lou-Andreas Salome. (Salome was the poet Rilke's lover, she jilted the philosopher Nietzche, took pyschoanalysis under Freud and became the first female pyschoanalyst.)
There is a movie being made about Leni. It will no doubt depict her a being misguided and possibly depict her as a nazi sympathizer. However, how will the movie tackle the issue of all the awards the world gave her films? Will the French, the English and the Americans who called her a genius back then also be called nazi sympathizers? And will they also be accused of not knowing better?
This is a mesmirizing film about a true genius who came along at the wrong time in the wrong place. It is as simple as that.",1024012800,,2495,4.7379310344827585
636051,5,6303389554,"This is, perhaps, the most fascinating documentary I have ever seen.  Leni Riefenstahl is a complex, controversial, and enigmatic individual.  The film very effectively raises (and ultimately does not answer) the question as to what extent artistic genius does or does not transcend political and national boundaries.  Director Ray Muller, in many ways, is not up to the task of interviewing this incredibly powerful and self-absorbed woman.  But, one must ask, who could be?  Muller carefully documents the story of her life, from her early days as a dancer and silver screen star, through the time of her involvement with the National Socialist Party, to her current life as an underwater photographer.  And the truth about anything is never quite clear.  Innovative and profound techniques abound from start to finish, contrasted with the persistent intellectual task of trying to determine just who this woman really was.  The film is long, and ultimately exhausting.  As it should be.  You will see things you have never seen before, and which you'll never forget (such as Hitler's amazing speech, and Riefenstahl's unparalleled underwater color photographs, to name just two!).  But, you're ultimately left with a question.  Was she, or wasn't she?  And, if she was or she wasn't, what is her responsibility?  Muller won't answer that for you.  My only advice is: don't ask her!  She'll just show you contempt and say, ""I did nothing wrong!""",992649600,,1447,5.145922746781116

636053,3,6303389554,"This film raises many, many provocative questions about Riefenstahl and her work. More importantly, the director also confronts her with these, and, given the nature of the accusations against her, she is less than  revealing. One wonders which of the many charges leveled at her bother the  most? Is she more bothered by the complaints that she was a Nazi  collaborator, or by the critique that her work contains a Fascistic  aesthetic.  Ultimately, this documentary comes off as an antidote to  Riefenstahl. It poses no clear answers, and often seems involved in trivia.  Watching Riefenstahl reminisce with her 'Olympiad' cameramen was  interesting, but dry. Seeing her physically shove the director of this  documentary emphasizes the frustration she feels at not being to present  her point of view.
At times, Muller's documentary could have taken some  tips from its subject: it was overlong, and seemed lacking in drama, and  seemed to get absorbed in the minutia. The presence of Muller and his crew  often seemed distracting; usually, when a documentarian appears in their  own film, I expect to see more about their own personal interest. Shots of  Riefenstahl alone in the massive settings of her documentaries were  powerful, but it seems difficult to reconcile with her busy lifestyle with  current partner.
Last week, Reuters reported that Riefenstahl, at 98,  survived a plane crash in Africa, where she was returning to visit the  Nuba. 'Triumph of the Will' seems to refer much better to Riefenstahl  herself than to her subjects.",952905600,,1547,5.161290322580645

Research  has shown that she DID use concentration camp inmates as extras in her  films. She denies this in the film, but the evidence is incontrovertible.  In any case, this is a fascinating film that tells as much about  Riefenstahl as it does about the filmmaker.

How can one not admire her talent,  her devotion to her craft, and her ability to revolutionize the industry.  Still, the ugly aspects of her life, particularly her support of Hitler  that lasted until the end of WWII, cannot be ignored.
Muller's engrossing  film leaves the viewer asking themselves ""What would I have done in  her place?"" ""Wonderful Horrible"" gets under your skin. A  must buy for WWII buffs and anyone who is interested in the power of media  and the conscience of an artist.",944352000,,761,4.8

The film explores her early career as a silent film actress to her rise as Hitlers 'go to' director all the way to her final years as an underwater filmmaker. For the casual student of WWII, there is a lot here to learn. She is an interesting study and her feelings about the films she made and why she made them may shock you.",1502668800,,422,4.3544303797468356
7845084,5,6303389554,"This documentary is a must if you want to learn more about Leni Riefenstahl. It captures her in a staunch performance of the role she chose to reinvent herself in after her association with Hitler and the Third Reich came back to bite her.

When I bought this DVD, I had heard of Riefenstahl but knew nothing about her, so I did not have any preconceived notions about her life or her work. As the documentary progressed, I got the sense that she was not being honest, particularly when professing ignorance about the actions of the Third Reich. Also, the way she defined her association with Hitler and other prominent Nazi figures sounded disingenuous. It seemed to me that the lady protests too much, and some of her explanations rang suspect, especially when you consider that at the time, she was a highly intelligent and savvy young woman, who was still sharp and alertand with an enviable memoryeven in her 90s. Clearly, forgetfulness was not the issue hererevisionism definitely was.

I found Riefenstahl to be a complex and intriguing individual and this documentary wetted my appetite for more, so I bough her autobiographyLeni Riefenstahl: A Memoir, and three other biographiesLeni: The Life and Work of (Bach), L.R: A life (Trimborn), L.R.: The Seduction of Genius (Rother), her documentariesVictory of Faith, Triumph of the Will, and Olympia, and four of her moviesThe Holy Mountain, Tiefland, The Blue Light, and White Hell of Pitz Palu. This gave me a 365 degree perspective that allowed me to relate what Riefenstahl and her biographers had to say about her acting, dancing and filmmaking skills to the actual material itself.

Im no expert, but her acting skills did not validate the hype, even less so for her interpretative modern dancing, which had novelty value back then. But were she unquestionably excelled in was her filmmaking abilities. She had an unerring eye for symbolism, composition and spectacular visualsshe was both creative and innovative, and can be rightfully credited for inventing and pioneering many techniques still used to this day.  Regardless of how she may be perceived today, no one can deny that she was ahead of her time, particularly when you consider she was a woman competing in a male-centric world. Well never know what else she would have been capable of achieving if she had made different choices. At any rate, her legacy and reputation will be forever and inextricably intertwined with Hitler and the Third Reicha sad example of be careful what you wish for.",1496188800,,2516,4.9691211401425175

7845088,4,6303389554,"Having recently watched a new film about Jesse Owens (Race), I was fascinating by the filmmaker of the 1936 Olympics, Leni Riefenstahl.  Played by Clarice van Houten (Game of Thrones) in the movie, she comes off as a polished documentarian constantly at odds with Hitlers right hand man Joseph Goebbels, minister of propaganda.  I knew of Riefenstahl and her 2 documentaries and that there was some controversy and wanted to know more.

I was surprised to discover that this 3+ hour documentary actually features a 91 year old Riefenstahl from beginning to end.  What is perhaps equally astounding is that she is surprisingly clear and cognizant and professes a great memory.  I mean how do you remember a cameras F-stop setting on a particular scene filmed nearly 60 years earlier?  Director Ray Muller and his crew follow Riefenstahl around to the various settings of her 2 famous films.  Triumph of the Will was a propaganda film showing off the rise of the Third Reich in all its glory.  The documentary of the 1936 Olympics called Olympia followed.  Both films introduced unheard of camera tricks and wonderful editing.  Film critics and historians agree that the films were technological masterpieces.

We see lengthy clips of each as Riefenstahl walks us through their development.  We don't see much of her early life but she begins her career as a dancer.  From what I saw, she wasn't a very good one either.  But she was attractive, ambitious and an adventurer.  She made the big time in her 20s as an actress in a series of German movies known as the mountain films. It is here that she got the attention of Hitler and they eventually met.  Now in her early thirties she wanted to travel and make documentaries.  Hitler and Goebbels hire her to make a series of propaganda films as Hitler was readying his storm troopers.

The controversy is addressed head on with Riefenstahl claiming ignorance of politics and a certain naivet regarding the anti-Semitism that was in full stride at the time.  Mullers film doesnt shy away from the issues and neither does Riefenstahl maintaining her innocence.  There are facts that support her and others that do not.  She was arrested after the war and appeared before the Nuremburg anti-Nazification trials.  She was not found to be guilty of anything other than a sympathizer.  Never the less, she was unable to find work in film other than self-produced ones.  She did go on to further adventures including living with African Nubian tribes and at the tail end of her life filming life under waterin her 90s!  This is an interesting, if overlong portrait of a provocative and fascinating woman and filmmaker.",1474070400,,2659,4.868596881959911
7845089,5,6303389554,"Director Ray Muller has provided a fascinating insight into the convoluted life and career of the recognized motion picture director visionary Leni Riefenstahl (1902-2003). Although her cooperative involvement in the making of this film was obviously crucial, her influence on the content must have been a directorial problem to some extent. This film was a major accomplishment for her to receive some redemption, no doubt in her view, and was probably thought by her to be the last opportunity to do so. Her dominating personality is displayed and her intelligence is clearly shown. It is interesting that she did not want to be filmed while walking and talking. And it is also noteworthy how she chose to dress herself in many scenes, in clothes that could be seen in some fashion magazines. She was certainly a master in knowing how to appear on screen. And she does not mince words when asked about controversial issues. There is doubt raised as to just how much, if any, knowledge she actually had that she was creating masterful propaganda or that her film work would be used as such. She even received a French award for her superiority in film making. And the most impressive record of her work may be her imagination and creativity in the filming of the 1936 Berlin Olympics wherein she pioneered and developed action filming techniques remaining in use today and hardly improved upon by her successors.",1472428800,,1413,4.916317991631799
7845090,5,6303389554,"Born in 1902 Germany, Leni Riefenstahl made her screen debut in the 1925 German silent film THE HOLY MOUNTAIN.  Directed by Arnold Fanck, the movie was a mountain film, a uniquely German genre that told stories of people who must struggle against nature in a mountain setting.  Fanck was strongly identified with the genre, and Riefenstahl became one of his favorite performers.  She was soon a noted actress, and in 1932 she wrote, directed, and starred in THE BLUE LIGHT, a variation in the mountain film genre.

Adolph Hitler was among Riefenstahls admirers, and she would make four films at his specific request, most notably TRIUMPH OF THE WILL (1935) and OLYMPIA (1938.)  Riefenstahl pioneered a number of cinematic effects in these films, and she and her films were widely admired at the time; with the onset of World War II, however, Riefenstahl was seen as Hitlers filmmaker and her movies less documentaries than Nazi propaganda.  Between 1941 and 1944 Riefenstahl used Nazi funds to film TIEFLAND, and in the process used Gypsy extras from concentration camps, at least some of them selected by Riefenstahl herself, visiting the camps for that express purpose.  After the war, Riefenstahl was arrested and on four occasions placed on trial for her association with the Nazi regime.  She repeatedly stated that she was essentially apolitical and unaware of Nazi crimes at the time.  Ultimately, she was described as a sympathizer and a fellow traveler, and she was never convicted of any war crime per se.

Riefenstahl spent much of the rest of her life trying to justify and explain away her association with the Nazis, and THE WONDERFUL HORRIBLE LIFE OF LENI RIEFENSTAHL spends three hours with her as she discusses her films, her relationships with Hitler and Joseph Goebbels, and her conviction that her films and activities had been grossly misunderstood.  Much of what she says seems to have tremendous veracity and to be in line with known fact, but what ultimately emerges is a portrait of an extraordinarily gifted, extraordinarily arrogant woman who seems determined to remember only what supports her own statements about her life and motives.  She is a little too facile, a little too emphatic in her statements for complete plausibility, and denial is a powerful force.

It seems unlikely that we will ever know the exact truth of Riefenstahls association with the Nazis, but having seen the documentary, I am tempted to suggest that she was an ambitious young filmmaker who was determined to use everything with her grasp to further her workbut who later found the result too terrible to admit even to herself.  The documentary concludes with an account of Riefenstahls inability to continue her career in any meaningful way after the war, a series of failed projects and partly completed works, photographs that were both celebrated and decried as intrinsically fascist, but Riefenstahl herself remains enigmatic, and fascinating, to the end.  How much was she wronged?  How much did she wrong others?  Is there a balance?  Leni Riefenstahl died at age 101 in 2003, after the completion of this film, leaving too many questions and too many half-answers behind.
