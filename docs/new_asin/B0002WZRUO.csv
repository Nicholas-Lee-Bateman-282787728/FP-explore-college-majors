2128643,5,B0002WZRUO,"This collection is amazing and a must have for any of Hockeytowns faithfull. I bought it purely for the March 26, 97 brawl with the Av's because I used to have it recorded on VHS and I lost it somewhere. I also already owned a couple of the championship DVD's but I was pleasently surprised with all of its content. I have been a Wings fanatic for my entire life and I know I will enjoy this collection for the rest of my life. If you are just a hockey fan I would buy it used to save money but any wings fan should spend the extra money and get it new. It's worth it!!! The magic moments segment is also amazing.",1127001600,3,613,4.032786885245901
2128644,5,B0002WZRUO,THIS D.V.D IS EXCELLENT.EVEN IF YOUR NOT A REDWING FAN.IT HAS GREAT GAMES FROM THE 90S.AND THE HISTROY OF THE TEAM.ITS GREAT FOR ANY HOCKEY FAN OR ANY SPORTS FAN.YOU WILL ENJOY.OVER AND OVER.,1121731200,3,191,4.647058823529412
2128645,4,B0002WZRUO,"Although I am, you don't have to be a Redwing fanatic to enjoy this set.  All three 'Hockeytown' documentaries are great to watch and reflect on their recent cups, but I especially like the fourth retrospective that chronicles the early successes through the Gordie Howe years, the frustracting 'Dead Wings' period of the 70's and 80's, and finally the rise of the Yzerman era which lead to the recent cup victories.  For those who don't know, this set had been in the making for a while and all 5 games included were indeed voted on by the fans (myself included) prior to being included, which I thought was a nice tribute to the fans of Detroit.  However, the only reason I didn't give this collection 5 stars is because I would have preferred they include the game against Montreal where they lit Patrick Roy up with 9 goals, to the triple overtime winner against Carolina in game 3.  The game in Montreal resulted in Roy leaving the Habs forever and would have been a perfect foreshadowing of him getting chased in game 7!",1113264000,,1026,4.590163934426229
2128646,5,B0002WZRUO,"This DVD contains 16 hours of highlights (to include 5 full-length games) from one of the premier franchises in the history of sports: The Detroit Red Wings.

The first disc begins with the story of the return of Lord's Stanley's Cup to its rightful place after over a 4 decade absence. The narrator tells the story of how the team had to literally have an ""extreme makeover;"" starting with the acquisition of forward Brendon Shannahan, in order to even think about toppling their mortal rivals the Colorado Avalanche.

Disc one sets the tone for the rest of the collection as you see the Red Wings quickly evolve into a physical, take-no-prisoners team with the legendary Steve Yzerman as their captain. The build-up toward their quest for their first Cup in 42 years will keep you on the edge of your seat. Action footage is punctuated with interviews w/players and Hall-of-Fame Coach Scotty Bowman in a way that makes you want to watch all 16 hours in one sitting. My 13 year-old son and I started watching at 10:00 one evening. It was very difficult to limit ourselves to just this one disc, and to finish the set in the coming days. The highlight selection and the editing at first rate.

This 4-disc set is destined to be a collectors item. It is my sincere hope that the powers-that-be at the NHL produce a set for all of the ""Original 6.""",1112054400,25,1346,4.6
2128647,5,B0002WZRUO,"I order this after Gary Bettman cancelled the season, and it's worth every penny and then some.  I've yet to watch all the games but almost cried when I watch Stevie Y blast the shot in the 96 Semi Finals against the Blues and it's almost been 9 years.

  This set is the best for any Red Wings fan.  It'll help with the season being cancelled and this upcoming long spring.  Oh and Gary Bettman sucks!!",1108944000,6,403,4.2368421052631575
2128648,4,B0002WZRUO,"It's a must have for any Wing's fans, assuming you don't already have all the games in the set.  The Stanley Cup programs ('97, '98, 2002) are all top notch, if a little cheesy.  The other extras are solid.

But I bought it for the games.  They are presented in their entirety minus the commercials and between-period breaks.  All are classics and worth the price of the set alone.  However I will say the quality is a bit disappointing.  I may be spoiled by recent Digital and HD hockey coverage, but the picture quality is very clearly video.  While you don't get the commercials, you do miss everything during the TV timeouts and on occasion come back a few seconds after the next faceoff.  They seem ripped right from the original broadcast, complete with the PASS logo. On a HD widescreen TV you MUST fix the screen aspect ratio and you'll end up with the bars along the side of the screen. Stretched out the low quality of the picture is even more pronounced.

Having said all that, they're still very watchable and whether you saw them the first time or not (who hasn't?) they're a great piece of Red Wings history. It's amazing what you forget and how much you remember re-watching them.  It's bittersweet with the current lockout, but helps scratch that itch.

4 of 5 because of the game picture quality, everything else is 5 of 5.",1108339200,2,1340,4.5375
2128649,5,B0002WZRUO,"This has everything a red wing fan would ever want in a dvd set. It covers thier 3 Stanley Cup wins in '97,'98 and '02, plus it has the top 5 games in their recent history voted by fans of the red wings. If I voted, I would probably pick these 5 games as well, they are the best with dramatic endings. Go Red Wings !!!!!!!!!",1106784000,3,324,3.9242424242424243
2128650,5,B0002WZRUO,"This set is absolutely awesome, and comes at a dark time in NHL history - just when we needed it!  If you read Carol Neumann's review, she states everything that I was going to say so I won't repeat it.  I will agree that watching these games on DVD is far superior to my old VHS tapes, I love it!",1105056000,2,297,3.933333333333333
2128651,5,B0002WZRUO,"You really have to love the DVD format. It has shown us the real meaning of special editions when talking about movies, has given us our favorite TV shows in complete seasons and now it has gone a step further and given us sports fans something very special. The best part about this set of DVD's are not the highlights and the behind the scenes interviews but the 5 full games that are included. These 5 games are without a doubt the 5 best games in recent Red Wing history. The fans who voted for these 5 games knew what they were talking about. I myself had these games taped onto VHS and have wathced them many times but the quality was pretty pathetic. Having these games on DVD is just about the greatest thing a Red Wing fan could ask for. I still get goosebumps when I watch these games and again this is a set that any Red Wing Fan must have.

In total you get 5 full games (the best 5 in recent history) + tons of extras including interviews & behind the scenes footage. I would have easily paid $100.00 for this set (20.00 per game) and the price is only around $40.00 which really is an amazing price for what you get. If your a Red Wing fan and your into DVD's then this one is a no brainer. Lets hope this trend continues as I would like to get a set like this for the Detroit Pistons as well. Anyways, enjoy this set - I know I will.",1099872000,64,1348,4.106060606060606
2128652,5,B0002WZRUO,a must have for every detroit redwings fan. I've only watched half of the dvd's so far. Really gets me revved up for hockey season...which has finally started...better late than ever.,1358640000,,183,4.935483870967742
2128653,5,B0002WZRUO,"This is a great video collection for any wings fan
 I watch and rewatch some of these games especially the avalanche beat down",1354665600,,126,4.478260869565218
2128654,5,B0002WZRUO,"If you are a Red Wings fan, or just a hockey fan in general, you NEED these games in your house. You will not be disappointed.

Also, with yet ANOTHER lockout thanks to Gary Bettman and his failed southern experiment, you will have to have some games on DVD or DVR in order to get through this lost season. The NHL Center Ice package is around $170, so the money you are saving by not buying that this year will go a long way towards packages like this one. Or, if you don't buy the Center Ice package, think of it as less than the cost of going to ONE NHL game..

Enjoy!",1353196800,,571,4.04424778761062
2128655,5,B0002WZRUO,"This is the only dvd set you need if you call yourself a Red Wings fan. The brawl, Yzerman's goal in 2ot, the Professor winning it in 3ot vs Carolina, the 7-0 elimination of the Avalanche, and the series winning game in '97.",1332806400,,224,4.232558139534884
2128656,3,B0002WZRUO,"I've owned this collection for some time but have never reviewed it.  There is a lot to like about this collection.  It's great to have the broadcast of the 1997 Cup clinching game, for instance.  The other games are a selection of various games in the 90's and early 2000's of some relevance.  Good to see them, but I'd have rather had Game 4 of 1998 (when Vladdie gets wheeled onto the ice) as well as Game 5 of 2002 (Cup clincher) as opposed to 2002's Game 3 or the 1996 Game 7 against the Blues (great game, but it's really only memorable for Yzerman's double OT goal).

The documentary portion really suffers from terrible narration which give them an amaturist presentation.  It's really a shame, since this could have been a tremendous collection if the documentaries had a ""Sports Century"" or ""America's Game"" feel to them.  The soundtrack that is used is quite annoying, and most times drowns out the conversation with the players being interviewed.

I guess it's not a bad collection for a true Red Wing fan, but it would have been great if they had concentrated on back stories such as Mike Ilitch's purchase of the team, Steve Yzerman's drafting after Pat LaFontaine (whom he Wings coveted due to his Michigan roots), Yzerman's relationship with Scotty Bowman (i.e. how Bowman wanted to trade him against Ilitch's wishes), the Russian Five, Shannahan's arrival, the Grind Line, etc, etc, etc.

NHL Productions needs to take a page from NFL Films and really think about a series similar to their ""America's Game"", even if they stick to francises vs. actual seasons.",1329782400,2,1576,4.764705882352941
2128657,2,B0002WZRUO,"Well, I was going to give this a four star, as it provided games I'd otherwise be forced to watch clips of via YouTube, but the set arrived with a Disc 1, a Disc 2, another Disc 2, and a Disc 4. Thanks for robbing me of a Disc 3 - and a copy of the 2002 game that went into triple overtime that was half the reason I bought the thing.

Fail.",1286928000,,341,3.671232876712329
2128658,5,B0002WZRUO,"This is an awesome DVD set that I will be recommending to friends and family!!!  I bought this DVD set for my husband's birthday and he LOVES it.  So do I.  The fact that it had some significant games in their entirety really peaked by interest.  I had never seen a couple of the 5 games on here but always wanted to.

That includes the 3-26-97 game against the Colorado Avalanche which was a brawl-fest when McCarty gave Claude Lemeaux a beating for hurting Kris Draper previously AND the Red Wings won 6-5 in OT to boot!  I wasn't a hockey fan at all back in 1997 before I met my husband.  After I became a Red Wings fan I really wanted to see that game that everyone still talks about.

I always wanted to see the 5-31-02 playoff game (Western Conference I think) against the Colorado Avalanche too because we didn't remember to record it. I had to unexpectedly work late that night while my husband was out of town in Chicago (which was blacked out from televising the game).  When I was driving home that night and finally got the chance to turn on the radio broadcast I couldn't believe my ears....SCORE, SCORE, SCORE.... I was using my Nextel to 2-way my husband over and over updating him on the score and my husband thought I was kidding him.  The Red Wings beat the Avs 7-0 AND Patrick Roy was pulled in the 2nd period.  I really kicked myself for not recording that game, but now we can watch it anytime we want on this DVD!

We haven't watched much of the highlights and special interviews etc yet to rate them, but I think they'll be pretty good.  I like hearing Mickey Redmond as a commentator and all the rest of the Fox Sports Detroit crew.  I think the Amazon cost ($20 + S/H) was more than worth it just for what we've seen so far.  Yesterday I saw this same item in Southwest Michigan retail stores for $35 - 40 so Amazon really has a good deal here!",1271548800,,1869,4.284900284900285
2128659,5,B0002WZRUO,"Highlights are for the casual 'fan' with limited attention span and no appreciation for the game.  MORE full broadcasts, like Sergei's five-goal game against the Caps!  C'mon NHL and Wings front office - open the vaults!",1269043200,,220,5.083333333333333
2128660,4,B0002WZRUO,"Sure, this set may be ""outdated"" now after the Red Wings' 2007-2008 championship.  But you can buy that single-disc DVD seperately for even more than this 4-disc series.  Chances are, if the NHL releases any more Red Wings DVD sets, they will not have the same content.  So for less than $20, you get DVD quality versions of the championship videos that you might already own on VHS.  Even without the full-length games included, the three titles for the 1997, 1998 and 2002 championships make this set worth the new lower price.",1235692800,,529,4.717391304347826
2128661,5,B0002WZRUO,"Disc 1, side A: Hockeytown (1996 - 1997); Side B: Return to Hockeytown (1997 - 1998)
Disc 2, Side A: Hockeytown 3 (2001 - 2002); Side B: ""Moments of Magic"" (1997)
Disc 3, Side A: 5.16.96: Game 7 conf. semi-finals vs. Blues (OT)
Disc 3, Side B: 6.8.02: Finals Game 3 vs. Hurricanes (2-1, Wings)
Disc 4, Side A: 5.31.02: Game 7 Conf. Finals Avalanche at Wings (7-0, Wings)
Disc 4, also Side A: 6.7.97: Finals Game 4 vs. Flyers (2-1, Wings)
Disc 4, Side B: 3.26.97: Avalanche at Wings (6-5 in OT, Wings)

This is an incredible set. How about that 3.26.97 game that ended 6-5? This game is a brawl-fest; less than a minute into OT Shanahan passes to McCarty for a 6-5 win. This is one of the classic games in Wings history, certainly recent history, because it proved that Detroit could not only beat Colorado, but really overpower them. The game really powered them after underachieving through the middle '90s.

The Flyers game is a must; McCarty's highlight reel goal on Hextall with 6:58 to go in the 2nd is one to rewind and watch a few times. Amazing. This game completed a 4-game sweep and a return of the Cup to Detroit.

5.31.02: Pat Roy is pulled short of halfway through the 2nd as the Red Wings pile up a 6-0 lead and cruise to a 7-0 final. A laugher.

The documentaries are good, although not award-winning material; basically, the highlight reels from '97, '98, and '02. The ""Moments of Magic"" documentary is about an hour and is a brief history of the Wings from 1930s - 1950s, and then considerable time is spent discussing the Ilitch purchase, the drafting of Yzerman, and the '97 championship team. There is a brief blurb about the Octopus as well. Very touching to see Yzerman hand the Cup to a wheelchair bound Konstantinov. Wow.",1230336000,10,1745,4.512658227848101
