There are three interesting stories (fictional)) which are weaved around a factual incident in Belgium in 1956 in which over 250 men were killed in a mine in Marcinelle (the original title of the film).  The tragedy had been the result of neglect by the mining company that paid foreign workers low wages and provided meager protection from the dangerous work the miners had been required to do.  The film builds the atmosphere and suspense, develops realistic characterizations, and evokes deep sympathies for the people.  The film is over 3 hours long, but is never boring.",1454025600,,685,5.0265486725663715
