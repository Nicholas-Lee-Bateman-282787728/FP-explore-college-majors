8269116,5,B0018BEG6Y,ALL OF CAL POZO'S DANCE DVD'S ARE EXCELLENT!,1435017600,,44,4.625
8269117,4,B0018BEG6Y,"Cal Pozo put together a good series of dance routines.
We use it a lot to keep up with the dance steps we have
not use in a while.",1398384000,2,130,3.5172413793103448
8269118,4,B0018BEG6Y,"I find the lessons straight forward and easy to follow,
However if you have bought another title by Cal Pozo, the same lessons may appear here,
I suspect that is the case with other DVD's in the series.",1358380800,,202,4.342105263157895
8269119,1,B0018BEG6Y,thought this dvd was a more up to date one but its an old version. clothes they wear are old. its like for older folks.,1356825600,,119,3.8
8269120,4,B0018BEG6Y,I found the overall video useful in helping a beginner to easily grasp the dance moves with confidence.  The video coverage of the dance steps was especially useful.,1351468800,2,165,4.892857142857143
8269121,5,B0018BEG6Y,"I have several left feet, not just three. My bride is a good dancer and insisted we go to a dance studio so that we could do a foxtrot at the wedding. I refused to. Then she gave me Pozo's Partner Dancing series. I refused to watch it. I'm glad she insisted. Pozo makes learning the basics really easy. I only tackled the foxtrot and the waltz for the wedding, but I've started on the Salsa one. What's great about what Pozo does is that he doesn't give a lot of steps but spends a lot of time in teaching how to lead the steps he gives you. My wife loves the Dancing With the Star show. I was never too crazy about it. But now I can at least understand how difficult it most be for some of those sports celebrities to do those routines. I recommend this series to any guy who doesn't necessarily want to get on a dance floor, but is forced to by a nagging good dancer bride or wife. Nick",1242345600,4,888,4.051136363636363
