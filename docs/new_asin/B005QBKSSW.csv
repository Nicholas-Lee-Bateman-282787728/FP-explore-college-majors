4858215,3,B005QBKSSW,"Singer Buddy Clark's voice was used at Fox in two instances I know about.  First, subbing for Jack Haley in ""Wake Up and Live,"" and here for Mark Stevens.  If you like Buddy Clark, you'll want to own these two films hands down, even though this one is very bland and frustrating entertainment. It's one of the George Jessel-produced films that look back with nostalgia on an earlier time in American show business -- it's purportedly the story of Joseph E. Howard, who wrote ""Good Bye My Lady Love,"" ""Hello My Baby,"" and the title tune, but it throws in a lot of other middling songs along the way.  It's a completely frustrating story, in which Joe (Mark Stevens, coming off like a cross between Robert Walker and Cliff Robertson) and Katie (June Haver) are brother and sister, except they're not because of an adoption or something.  Throughout the entire film, there are two irritating strains: Katie's in love with Joe, but he's blind to it, having affairs with two self-centered divas (Martha Stewart, who's a bland performer, and Lenore Aubert in a kind of ""Fritzi Scheff"" role, doing operetta material); and he keeps playing the tune for ""I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now,"" but there's never a lyric until Reginald Gardiner figures it out one day near the end of the film when Joe's on a bender and traveling across the country attempting to find himself.  From where I sit, there's nothing more annoying than the audience being way ahead of the characters and being frustrated with how stupid they are when love is smacking them right in the face.  So the plot really stinks.  This Technicolor print, however, is one of the most gorgeous I have seen on DVD -- it's crisp, and the colors are eye-popping.  The sets and costumes for the musical settings are really beautiful, but the material never really rises to the occasion.  Choreography is by the great Hermes Pan, and June Haver is paired with a pre-Warner Bros. Gene Nelson to great effect in more than one number.  There's an unfortunate and completely unnecessary ""blackface"" -- June is body-painted all over and with a black wig, singing along with white Joe Howard.  Fortunately she does not do anything stupid or demeaning, but it's gratuitous.  It turns out, based on the above three songs and other titles in his catalogue, that Joseph Howard was a great American songwriter, but the film pulls back and just doesn't give enough of the joy and energy he put into his material.  Still, the hands at Fox all had roots in turn of the century entertainment (that's 19th into 20th century; Howard was born in 1878), and as usual the depictions of stage material are really good.  It you can pull out the numbers, you'd have something interesting but unfortunately nothing great.  But if you want to see Fox Technicolor at its ripest, this DVD is one to buy.  (Interesting footnotes: Howard was sued by a former employee, Harold Orlob, when the film came out, demanding no money but taking Howard's name off of ""I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now"" as the chief composer!  To this day, I believe Howard still gets credit for writing this song, even though he apparently did not.  The other footnote is that Howard died on stage in Chicago in 1961 singing ""Let Me Call You Sweetheart.""  Thanks to Wikipedia.  Interested readers should add more info here, via comments, if they know it.)",1372550400,2,3343,4.731034482758621
4858216,5,B005QBKSSW,"I was so pleased with finding this older musical available as I am with most all of them. The color, distinct & clear picture detail & sound was excellent in this revived  story on DVD,  June Haver was always very good in any of her pictures & this was true to form for her as was Mark Stevens role. Very pleased to have this in my collection.",1371945600,4,343,4.104477611940299
4858217,4,B005QBKSSW,"One of Fox's early post war musicals showcasing the talents of June Haver.

Plenty of songs, elaborate settings for the finale make this an enjoyable song feast.

As for print quality, I rate it 8/10.  It looked good when projected on to our large screen, but having said this, it is not the best Fox have released.  Certainly no where near as bad as some have suggested.

Well worth buying as an example of Fox's fine technicolor musicals.",1371772800,,440,4.589743589743589

4858219,5,B005QBKSSW,"I think the 20th Century Fox musicals were just as good or better than MGMs just look at The Sound Of Music, The King And I, South Pacific, Hello Dolly! all very lavish with great sets, costumes, color and sound.even I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now? with the very talented June Haver is a real gem. It also has the wonderful dancing of Gene Nelson in it in one of his very early screen apearances. there are great songs a good supporting cast with Mark Stevens, Martha Stewart and Wlliam Frawley and June was a great singer,dancer and pianist she does not get the reconition of other musical stars the film has beautiful Technicolor and great sound its pure delight a great Fox musical lets hope more will come out like this one.",1361232000,7,728,4.481203007518797
4858220,3,B005QBKSSW,"How I long for the day when studios were releasing films that were beautifully restored and loaded with extras.  I understand that these on-demand DVDs are not restored, but this print looks like the ones I used to see on the late-late show back in the 70s.  You can tell it was once beautiful to look at, but it certainly isn't now.  I hate to give anything a bad review, because it is rare when anything is being released today.  However, this is one of the worst I've seen.",1361059200,7,476,4.314606741573034

4858222,5,B005QBKSSW,"While I would like to see more Grable musicals on DVD, this is very entertaining -- especially Martha Stewart turning in a very good performance and doing two very good musical routines. Gene Nelson shines in his screen debut. I wonder why we don't see ""Three Little Girls in Blue"" on Fox Classic list.",1359331200,4,302,4.611111111111111
4858223,5,B005QBKSSW,"June Haver began her career with a bit role as a hat check girl in
The Gang's All Here (1943), but after only a few short years at Fox,
she starred in a big musical opposite Betty Grable in
The Dolly Sisters (1945), which is available on dvd.
I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now (1947), Three Little Girls
In Blue (1946) and Oh, You Beautiful Doll (1949) are
three of her other great Technicolor musicals at Fox.

June co-stars with Mark Stevens who plays songwriter, Joe E. Howard,
who composed the music to such songs as Hello Ma Baby, Honeymoon,
Goodbye My Lady Love and the beautiful title song.

As with all 20th Century Fox musicals of the 1940s, you can be sure
of great songs, beautiful costumes and lavish production numbers,
all in glorious Technicolor. I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now
is right up there with the best of them. At Warner Brothers, she
starred in two big Technicolor hits with Gordon MacRae:
Daughter Of Rosie O'Grady (1950) and Look For The
Silver Lining (1949). Both are available on dvd.

20th Century Fox Archives has had it's problems with the quality
of some releases, but this dvd looks very good, although it's
a bit on the soft-focus side but the Technicolor is a knockout!
There are no extras.

Hopefully Fox will release all of June Haver's best musicals.",1356566400,19,1285,4.598253275109171
4858224,5,B005QBKSSW,"For anyone who misses the good old days of movie musicals, this is the one for you. The Technicolor is a knock-out, the musical numbers are worth applauding, and June Haver and the over-looked Mark Stevens are delightful. The title song is the 10 minute finale which is what movie musicals used to be like. Definitely buy this one if you love musicals and love the good old days of the 40's and 50's when we had entertainment. I applaud 20th Century Fox for releasing this gem. And the quality of this DVD is first rate.",1355529600,23,520,4.427083333333333
4858225,4,B005QBKSSW,"If you enjoyed the musicals of the late 40s, this is one of the best.  The songs - so good - so beautifully presented - bring joy and longing to your heart.  ""Ladylove"" and ""Honeymoon""  are simply overwhelming in the way they takes you back to vaudeville at the turn of the century.  June Haver was captivating in her portrayal of ""Sis,"" and sang and danced divinely.  Mark Stevens looked the role, and even though his singing was dubbed in, he made it work.  Martha Stewart deserves a cheer too - she handled her character and her songs with style.  To sum up. the movie is a real joy.",1402876800,2,586,4.321100917431193

4858232,1,B005QBKSSW,"Reading the various reviews is very confusing.  I've read several reviews commenting on how bad the DVD quality is, regarding bad color and image quality.  And then I read others commenting on the excellent quality, color and image quality.  Usually comments don't vary in completely different directions regarding the actual quality of the image itself, rather than on the movie.  Does the actual quality vary from one runoff to the other, or is it that some of us have higher standards than others?  I'd like to buy this if quality really is top rate, but if quality is as bad as some say, I would rather wait and hope for a restored blu-ray copy in the future.
  Since writing my question, I have now purchased this movie for my mother, who was on the set when the movie was being filmed. She was a guest of the producer and director and was able to meet some of the stars.  So naturally she was happy to see the movie in it's entirety after all these years.  I was a bit disappointing after watching movies on my high definition set and now my ultra high definition set.  The quality was a giant step down.  Some scenes (especially darker scenes) were even only on par or sub par to VHS tape.  It seems this was taken from old tape versions of the movie rather than mastered or re-masters from original film elements.  Hopefully a better version, preferably Blu-ray will be issued soon.",1380758400,4,1390,4.534136546184739

8483157,4,B005QBKSSW,"Were the suits from 20th Century-Fox reaching, I wonder, when they hanged their hats on this 1947 slice of Americana? I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now is a biopic, but do take it with a grain of salt. It chronicles the life and times of renowned turn-of-the-century songwriter Joseph E. Howard, yeah, but thru the prism of rewrites and liberties taken and powerhouse executive Darryl F. Zanuck's rancor. Rumor whispers that Zanuck, unhappy with the screenplay's progression, demanded that the character of Katie be put in. Sure 'nuff, it's not Joe Howard's mad skills as a songman that drives the plot and lures me in, but, rather, sweet Katie's machinations.

Today, who knows of Joe Howard, heralded in the movie as that ""ageless American troubadour""? Sure, you'd probably heard of his most celebrated ditty, ""Hello! Ma Baby,"" but it's probably because, when you were a kid, you saw that classic Chuck Jones cartoon about the singing frog. His next most famous song is probably this movie's title track, that jilted man's lament, ""I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now,"" although some controversy went down regarding who its primary composer was.

Mark Stevens carved a cozy niche in film noir, most notably in gritty pictures like The Dark Corner (1946) and The Street with No Name (1948) - so, okay, sure, why not put him in a vaudeville musical presented in glorious Technicolor? Thankfully, Stevens is a solid performer. He makes it work. There he goes as Joe Howard circa 1890s as he evolves from hawking organs for the New Jersey Tabernacle Supply Co. over in Weehauken to composing and writing lyrics for Tin Pan Alley to making melody for Broadway. It helps that Stevens doesn't have to do his own crooning. In lieu of Stevens, Buddy Clark delivers the Pat Boone-ish vocals. He's not bad.

3.5 out of 5 stars. I liked it fine. It's a nice fix for those jonesing for an injection of early Americana. It suits us nostalgia buffs. But much of the movie is the same-ol', same-ol'. Glom on to the ups and downs of the vaudeville struggle. The stage performances. The backstage jealousies. That shady manager (William Frawley). Eyeball our man's fickle romances even as the girl from back home yearns for him, her adoration unrequited.

Luckily, June Haver is onscreen to liven things up. She revives this dead horse. And maybe Zanuck's notion was grand after all. Haver plays Zanuck's ""Katie,"" the girl in whose household an orphaned Joe Howard was raised. Joe considers Katie his little sister, never mind that Katie's been crushing on him since forever. But you needn't fret about Katie. As you'll see, she can fend for herself. In fact, Joe's got her to thank for his career.

Joe's songs, from ragtime to ballads, are pleasant enough, but they're mostly unmemorable. June Haver's what turns your head. Hers is a character that could easily have aggravated the movie audience. Katie's sweet face belies her crafty nature. Katie is a mighty fibber. She doesn't hesitate to apply trickeration to get her way, to put Joe in the best light possible. But I found myself excusing her unabashed duplicity, and that's big kudos to June Haver who somehow finesses it just so and makes it all palatable. Her antics are the highlights of the show, her singing pleases me, she looks awful winsome, and so forth and so forth, to quote that one guy in the movie.",1462060800,,3347,4.82404181184669
