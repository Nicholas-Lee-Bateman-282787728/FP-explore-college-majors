7914512,4,B00001O2FM,"This is a very good set to own for those of you who love watching the Discovery Channel.  Each of the discs contain four 30-minute or so episodes, unfortunately with minimal add-ons (a text summary and a brief  ""test your knowledge"" interactive question and answer portion).  Don't expect any DTS-quality sound either.  Still, I give 4 stars to this  collection for both its very interesting and thought-provoking content as  well as it's relatively cheap price.  I've read countless articles on the  Loch Ness monster, for instance, and I still learned something new from  this set!",950227200,8,583,5.052631578947368
