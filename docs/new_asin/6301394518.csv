7811600,1,6301394518,I got this movie for one dollar and that is all it is worth. I did not find it overly educational. The footage wasn't great. And the narrator rambled on sounding uniterested. It is your opinion if you like it or not but I found it quite BORING!,1226016000,,244,4.104166666666667
7811601,4,6301394518,"The shaping of this documentary revolves more about general mysteries of oceanic life than about its stated subject, the great white shark, but the film never lacks for compelling subject matter, with host and narrator Glenn Ford ably commenting upon the action, much of which is of a creature that has been hunted into a condition of scarcity approaching extinction.  Obviously released to exploit the enormous success of the feature film JAWS, this effort rests firmly upon its own considerable merits, derived for the most part from creative underwater photography by a primarily French crew and from its disparate settings in several seas and along coasts of South Africa, Australia, Central America, and the Solomon Islands.  Included is the sole known 16mm. record depicting an immediate aftermath of a shark attack upon a person, an Australian scuba diver who is seen being lifted aboard in an obvious state of shock with his right leg largely severed as a tourniquet is applied, a horrifying scene not ameliorated in the least by an up-beat interview made years later with the victim.  The film maunders about, consistently well-read by Ford, frequently leaving its stated subject of the great white to focus in turn upon others of the 27 man-eating shark species, including the fascinating hammerhead; a deadly Pacific sea snake; various folkways of Solomon Islanders; with frequent digressions into the ecologic importance of our oceans, and while editing is at times ineptly effected, there is never consideration of a viewer's lack of desire to concentrate upon the screen.",1097798400,,1585,5.207843137254902
