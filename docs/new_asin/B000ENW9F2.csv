8174328,5,B000ENW9F2,"What a *beep* AWESOME movie! It's very entertaining, hilarious and insanely gory! It's only 20 minutes long, but it's one of the goriest movies ever! About 20 people die in gory ways! There's a gore scene every 5 SECONDS! The special effects are really cheap, but they're still awesome because they're really over-the-top and they remind a lot of the special effects in Zombie Doom (Andreas Schnaas)! You love gore? Watch it! I know that you'll love it!",1259280000,,453,4.82051282051282
