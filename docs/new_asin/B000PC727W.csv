8190407,3,B000PC727W,The video is okay in quality but I found more information on the internet then in this DVD.  The training part is good but not inclusive.  And the looping dog play is not what I want for my dog as I prefer his calm not stirred up.,1374451200,,230,3.872340425531915
8190408,3,B000PC727W,"If you have read papillon books, there is no new info here. If you don't have time to read the DVD is OK.  Used one adolescent puppy for demonstration purposes. I would have liked to see more adult dogs representing colors, standards, beauty, personality, sizes, breed uses (working in hospitals, service dogs, agility?) Training section helpful.",1277769600,2,346,5.178571428571429
8190409,4,B000PC727W,"Maybe I expected too much from this DVD, but I found it to be just OK, not great.
It does contain some useful information and interesting facts,  especially for the first time owner on the breed, but it could be so much more entertaining, considering that Papillon such fun high energy dog.  It was a bit boring and incomplete.",1220400000,,327,4.52542372881356
8190410,3,B000PC727W,"I would of enjoyed this video alot more if the irritating music did not play the entire time.

There were, however, alot of interesting facts, would of like to see more visuals on certain areas. And more visuals on other Papillons at different ages.

But the bonus training video was and exceptional deal almost makes up for the other dog movie that was nothing but dog playing in a park, no knowledge shared on that one.

All in all I was satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this video to anyone eager to learn more basic information about the papillon breed.",1200528000,5,571,4.578431372549019
