This series is funny, entertaining, wild, and full of beautiful girls, if you like that sort of thing (I certainly do :)

I don't know what else needs to be said: this series is funny, entertaining, uplifting at times, silly, absurd, and I can't stop watching. A few of tghe singing production numbers are superb, and the beautiful girls are astonishing.

Watch the performances of the TV hostess during the Competion, watch Grandma, Apolinare, Zaca, Hassan, the teenaged girl Jr. Manager, and a few others. They are amazing in driven power.

One of the funniest lines, in Spanish was ""How do you spell 'Hassan?' Is that with a 'J'....?

Hahahaha----oh, well, maybe that's just me.

SPANISH WITH GREAT SUBTITLES, but I suspect it's funnier if you speak Spanish.

I recommend this. WATCH IT! :)",1431820800,,944,4.89937106918239
