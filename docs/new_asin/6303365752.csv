641294,5,6303365752,"This is one of those movies that will stay with me for some time to come.  I note that it has been termed 'disturbingly violent' by some reviewers, but that isn't the reason this will stay with me.  The mining of blood diamonds is based on forced labor in war-torn countries, primarily to finance insurgents, so I expected violence.  What I didn't expect was for this movie to portray such a wide range of humanity--from international greed through what happens to people living in a war zone, to the simple love of family and a desire to restore that family.  The story within this movie is moving, tender, violent and powerful.",1495756800,,629,4.63963963963964

So I didn't. And we're now married. This movie (mostly my wife being awesome though) saved me thousands of dollars!  Thank you, Blood Diamond!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE!  Oh, and my girlfriend (now wife) liked the movie, too.  Double win!",1495497600,,423,4.586666666666667
641298,5,6303365752,"A very powerful movie that shows both the best and the worst of human nature. I cried while watching this movie. The destruction and heartache caused by greed seems to know no bounds. That being said, I thought Leo's accent was very irritating and unauthentic. Other than that, this movie has outstanding acting and writing. The cinematography was beautiful. The movie made me feel very invested in the outcome, which leads to my only gripe... not hearing what Solomon had to say at the end.
I'm sorry I waited so long to watch this movie, and I will most definitely watch it again. 9.8/10 must watch.",1495411200,,601,4.679245283018868

I have never been a fan of diamonds, after watching this movie I am even less a fan!!! this movie really puts into perspective how blind and ignorant we are to what is really going on around this world. It was not my pick to watch this movie, but I will say this is the best movie I have seen in a very long time!!! Absolutely incredible!!! Please, please, please watch this movie and get educated!!!",1494979200,,461,4.25
641368,5,6303365752,"A movie, brutally depicting what I believe to be an accurate representation of the corporate greed and it's impact on 3rd world countries.  With that said, the acting, choreography, the images of the children without an arm, all done with journalistic style, yet left with the emotional, gut wrenching horror of how inhumane a human can be.  A bit cliche of Cap's demise, yet having him ride off into the sunset with her, would diminish the power this movie's message has.  We say, 'Blood Diamond', yet could just as easily, 'Blood Oil', 'Blood Gold', 'Blood ........' and fill in the blank for any rare mineral or resource that a corporation wants.  Our own country's hands are stained with the blood of those who stood in the way, from the time the Pilgrims landed to our own Arizona Senators signing away mining rights of the Apache land to foreign investors, to the killings in S Dakota and the DAPL.",1494979200,,904,4.7025316455696204

From the acting, to the plot, to the direction and story line to the bone-chilling truth of what the movie showcases, it is just masterfully done. I love Leo in this movie and Djimon Hounsou's performance as Solomon Vandy is second to NONE and literally gives me the chills and goosebumps and watery eyes every single time.

641439,2,6303365752,"Nice feel good movie, might even be a chic flick with some gratuitous violence. Has all the usual hollywood clichs and stereo types. Acting is very good by the lead black actor but everyone else is limp and painfully predictable and shallow. 2x stars for story line and 1x star for casting. Parts are very slow and anemic in development but there is an occasional burst of realism and attention grabbing. Over all adequate for about 1+20 investment but 2+20 is way to long. Just doesn't have what it takes to be recommended to anyone.
******** leo dicaprio obviously made had a nice payday from this movie project. Appears that he was so moved by the brutality in war torn Sierra Leon that he became a large financial backer in the Diamond Foundry based in Santa Clara Calif. producing man-made diamonds, doing his part to rid the world market of ""blood diamonds"". So because man made diamonds have a resale value on the open market of nil and the grading criteria is sloppy and not recognized by GIA or the gem industry as a whole AND there is a price premium as much as 20% compared to natural earth made the most honorable leo di is making some serious coin here. Not a big leap to make a generalization about the elite entrainment industry and the ""top"" tier types.",1491004800,,1269,4.545851528384279
641440,5,6303365752,"A great eye opener movie. I've seen it plenty of times, and every time I watch it I get goose bumps, and I am truly mezmoriezed by the story told in Sierra Leone Africa.
The Film takes place in the late 1990s about the illegal diamond smuggling trade as well as the civil war in the West end of Africa, Sierra Leone.
  Solomon Vandy (Dijmon Hounsou) is a father of three, who is also a fisherman in a Mende village. When his village is suddenly over run by RUF ( revolutionary united front) rebels Solomon and his son Dia try to take shelter and hide from the rebels into the safe haven of the villages hits by the ocean.
However Solomon is eventually captured and his family is taken away from him by the rebels. While the rebels are severing the limbs of the natives to prevent voting and other political actions, Solomon Vandy is put aside to become a worker in the diamond mining camps in Sierra Leone.
Meanwhile , Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) a diamond smuggler and ex military militia member is cuaght smuggling diamonds into Liberia the neighboring country to Sierra Leone.
Danny Archer is arrested and sent into a West African prison.
  After Solomon Vandy is in the mining camp working, he asks Captain poison the ruthless psychotic Warlord, to use the restroom. After finding a huge pink diamond Stone solve and tries to smuggle it out of the camp and bury it in the rainforest. Captain poison then confronts him while trying to bury it in the sand. Suddenly they are attacked the rebel mining camp, by government Nationals Army. Solomon is then again captured and sent to the same prison in which the character Danny Archer played by Leonardo DiCaprio is held. Danny Archer overhears Captain poison who is also locked up in the same prison, calling out Solomon for bearing the diamond in front of all the jail inmates. Danny Archer becomes privy to what is going on, and makes arrangements to bail out Solomon Vandy.
  After Archer  him self is bailed out of prison he reports to a Colonel Courtzee, a corrupt military leader Commando who is also in the smuggling of illicit blood diamonds. Danny archers plan is to pitch to Solomon Vandy , to find the blood diamond and take it to the corrupt Diamond Traders  corporation of London, England called Vande Kamp. Danny Archer subordinate to Vandy camp and Colonel Courtzee, gets permission to track down Solomon and retrieve the pink diamond Stone.
  During this process Danny Archer is having a drinks at a bar while meeting or confronted by a undercover reporter / journalist, Maddey Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) who is doing a story of the trials and tribulations of Sierra Leone. And also the vast amount of violence due to the unsanctioned Diamond Trading and smuggling out of Sierra Leone. Jennifer confronts Leo's character calling him out and questioning his morals and beliefs in the business. Leo contradicts her Theory by claiming that America's are the biggest buyers and purchasers of most of these blood diamonds.
  Without giving too much more aware of the movie if you have not already seen it. The three of these characters do eventually meet and are intertwined as they search for the blood diamond Solomon Vandy buried in the mining camp running all over West Africa.
  The film also discusses or portrays the Civil War or Rebel united front, a local sort of terrorist military, that recruits young kids to become killers. With often very violent scenes in a war-torn country, this movie definitely takes you on a thrill / roller coaster ride up and down every time.
  I myself thought the film was phenomenal. The fictional, yet somewhat true story documentary feel, about Sierra Leone is fascinating. Packed with plenty of action and story telling, shot by Veteran war movie director Edward Zick. You will be truly taken back and enthralled by 2006 masterpiece mostly filimed in the beautiful African countryside and rainforest. With a tramtic and also epic ending, Blood diamond is one of my favorite war thriller films with stellar performances by all three actor's . (Leonardo DiCaprio Djimoun Hounsou, and Jennifer Connelly) all of the movie does have a r rating. I do recommend it for all types of audiences to view, and watch under proper parental supervision also.

So break out the candy, soda, and popcorn and make it a movie night at your house and I definitely do recommend watching Blood Diamond! If you haven't already seen it.",1490572800,,4421,4.7808398950131235

I had to give a 5 star rating, because of the power of the film and the emotions it brought out of me. It's hard, living in a peaceful country, to even begin to understand the reality of what happened, in the search for the blood diamonds.

The movie itself was good, and well acted by Leonardo DiCaprio, but the stupid father of the movie pissed me off at every turn.  It's like he wasn't intelligent enough to comprehend basically anything... Watch as he screams and yells throughout the movie, sabotaging DiCaprios attempts to help him every chance he could.",1487116800,,622,5.22

Unfortunately, this is Sierra Leon and the reality is TIA.  Very good movie to learn why things that are costly are costing more than money.  More than money can measure in lives, families, villages, land, and peace, not to mention any hope for integrity.  This movie stayed with me for days.  A good reason for families to pass on what gems they have to the next generation and not pay into this deadly (and overpriced) junk, no matter what the ending says.",1486598400,,588,4.509433962264151

641962,5,6303365752,"A tragic situation where western capitalist nations do not need to employ their own troops to extract mineral wealth with direct subjugation in a post-colonial Africa. The commodity here are diamonds. The tribal divisions lead to incredible slaughter of Africans at the hands of other Africans and that makes one wonder if it is based on the slaughter experienced at the hands of former white Colonial masters: a horrific  emulation to keep some of the wealth and political power by one tribe over another. Within this context a white female journalist is out to expose the machinations that keep an illegal or banned trade of diamonds going in a particular country. In the meantime a Black African hides a big piece of diamond while performing slave labor after being captured by a trbal band parading as revolutionaries--the same ones who kidnapped his son to convert him into a child soldier (another sub-tragedy). The Black Afrcan hid the diamond rock and to retrieve it---with the help of a white African diamond dealer---becomes the means to reunite with his son, wife and daughter. At the end a happy and ironic ending, but not if you are a Leonardo DiCapio fan and see through the hipocracy Western so-good doers in stooping the blood diamond contraband.",1485820800,,1262,4.952830188679245

642353,5,6303365752,"Just another 5 star performance from Leonardo DiCaprio as well as the other main actor and actress. not sure of their names so I don't want to get myself into trouble guessing . This one is up there with Leo's best!  It also will really open your eyes to the true enterprises and atrocities behind the global diamond market! Especially the tribal and civil wars in Africa that are directly supported by it! If it weren't for American's and other European countries buying such large quantities of wedding diamonds and gems without thought or care for where they truly came from then there would be a great deal more African men and woman without missing arms or worse off dead altogether!
Anyways, this movie is truly a perfect blend of cinematic fact and fiction while also providing a deep portrait of one man's continuous inner conflict between true righteousness and the love of money!

Definitely a movie you will love and remember and an ending you will be praying for the entire length of the movie!

Total example of Hollywood packaging of actors that probably looked great on paper but in reality proves to be more form than substance especially when based-on half-baked script.  Cannot recommend -- better to watch Daniel Craig as 007 in Spectre one hundred times than to watch this movie once.  This film should've been called ""Blood CZ.""",1483142400,,400,4.955223880597015

644104,5,6303365752,"Africa. It's a mysterious continent that most individuals in the western world know little about. What do you know about it if at all? For me, I actually took a college course on African politics, so I am familiar with Africa's struggles and its triumphs too. Believe me that Africa does have potential, but it needs both internal institutions and external actors that can support it as it builds a solid foundation for future generations. Blood Diamond starring Leonardo DiCaprio in the main role showcases how most individuals in Africa just don't have the opportunity to better their lives unless they do something we deem illegal in the western world (e.g. killing, stealing, or bribing). In the film, Leonardo DiCaprio stumbles across a humanitarian-oriented journalist played by Jennifer Connelly who showcases how one person's actions can alter the trajectory of the lives of thousands indirectly, but also a few lives directly in a big way such as creating a new life for someone you barely even know though trust with all your heart.

644314,4,6303365752,"The movie's biggest strength is its unflinching exposure of drafting child soldiers, which essentially means bribing them with rock-n-roll, violence, and cocaine. This subplot gives all of the action-adventure shoot 'em up violence its lasting impact. Otherwise, Blood Diamond is just another handsomely mounted, impressively staged Hollywood action flick.

Despite some complaints, I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio was convincing in his role. Evil is always more convincing when it wears a handsome face. Until the very end, Di Caprio always conveyed a sense of duplicity and self-interest in his performance. His acting was in no way a feel-good performance about a mercenary who sees the err of his ways and finally does the right thing. At the end, the right thing is the only thing he can do because he's bleeding to death and pinned down by the guys who used to be his friends. His Oscar nomination was entirely deserved.

Connelly and Hounsou excel in their roles, though both actors are usually better than their material, which lays out the politics of diamond smuggling with unlikely lucidity.

The Blu-ray is an acceptable improvement over the DVD. The biggest improvement are the dark areas at the beginning, which in the DVD version were grainy and fuzzy, practically unwatchable. Those problems are corrected, and everything else in terms of picture and sound is about the same.",1482019200,,1393,5.154867256637168

Leonardo and Jennifer's acting was outstanding and believable. I am so glad that Leonardo put on a South African accent for his role and that he did not act with an American accent because this made the film more authentic. There are not that many authentic films being made nowadays. Jennifer was naturally beautiful in her role as the American journalist despite the lack of makeup and plain clothes. Her intelligence and talent just radiated from the screen and she did not need these embellishments. The growing genuine romance between Leonardo and Jennifer was really beautifully written in the plot without any crude sex scenes. I found this refreshing in today's movie culture where sex and violence dominate the movie plots. This made the film both tasteful, classy and unique. A rarity in present day movies. I definitely recommend this film to anyone over the age of 18. It has definitely given me an insight into the world of diamond trading and has forever changed my view on diamonds.",1481587200,,1174,4.783251231527093

We, in our family are ever so grateful that we do not lust after diamonds or precious metals.  Simply another form of brainwashing on the world.  Who would pay thousands for a rock just because the money mongers say it is valuable?

644613,3,6303365752,"Three stars because almost every scene with DiCaprio is centered around and set up to show-case  cigarettes.  That is, the entire film is a  cigarette advertisement.  Just watch and you'll see. It's distracting and gets old fast.

Too many scenes centered around cigarettes. It's like a 1 1/2 hour cigarette commercial.

Also, I'm half way through the film and the film is very confused. There are three main themes going on, civil war and its atrocities, children being abducted by rebels and brainwashing becoming murders (this is a documented fact in real life), and diamond smuggling and how it relates to the other two. However, there is no focus on any one theme, and all three are not being developed well at all.

It is so far just a confused film in that it doesn't know what it wants to be, since it is thus unfocused on any of the themes.. Being such, the film fails to draw me in and feels extremely topical and without depth. I have formed no attachment to any of the characters yet half way through.",1481068800,,1013,4.56353591160221

The relationship between the DiCaprio character and the female photojournalist lacked sparks and went nowhere. The black keeper of the stone was initially too much in the periphery of the story to make the needed transition to the center of our concerns at the end.

645300,4,6303365752,"I had not seen this one before so I DVR'd it and watched it recently when there was nothing else on.

I did not expect much from it but was pleasantly surprised.

Dicaprio plays a former Rhodesian soldier who is currently a diamond smuggler just about right, even has an accent that seems plausible.

Solomon,a  local tribesman is captured and forced to help mine for diamonds during the Sierra Leone civil war. He finds and manages to hide a large pink diamond. Somehow Dicaprio's character finds out about it and they enlist the help of a journalist played by Jennifer Connely to retrieve it.

This is pretty much a movie where everyone involved is trying to use other people to get what they want. Solomon wants to use the diamond to get his family back. Dicaprio's character wants the diamond so he can get out of Africa. Connolly's character wants a story.

I thought Connelly's character was less believable than the others. She seemed way too ""good"" for being a journalist who has been around a lot of wars over the years as the movie tried to portray her.

Lots of shooting that is kind of loud in some spots, but pretty well done.",1441584000,,1139,4.553921568627451

645848,3,6303365752,"Blood Diamond, 2006 film

A man and his son talk about Utopia (nowhere). Then armed men in trucks arrive in their village and start shooting people and chopping off hands! There is a civil war in Sierra Leone (Lion Mountain). The West wants to ban the sale of rough diamonds. [Competition to the South African diamond cartel.] People are captured to work in mining diamonds. There is a harsh penalty for theft! An arms trader arrives to make a deal with Commander Zero, guns for diamonds. Next we see a writer for National Geographic with his goats. Miners try to hide diamonds. Government troops attack the rebels. People read lists of names (missing or dead). We see the oppression of people by armed men. Mercenary soldiers are used by the Government to oppose the rebels and take over the diamond fields. [War is about loot.]

Diamond sellers meet customer demands for shiny jewelry. [Diamonds are forever, unless they are destroyed by high heat.] Government soldiers arrive to shoot up the town and create a massacre! People hide in homes! Life is nasty, short, and ugly. An American reporter helps Danny. She films the refugees in camps. Solomon greets his daughter and learns about his missing son. The reporter needs someone who will go on record about Blood Diamonds to affect purchases in the West. [Economics drives politics.] Danny tells how diamonds are exported as legitimate. He has a list of names and bank accounts. The road trip is halted by shooting. Young boys are trained to use AK-47 assault rifles. The bus is shot up, but Danny and Matty Burns escape with Solomon into the bush. We are friends. A camera calms the militia. Are people inherently good? [Statistics suggest otherwise.]

Danny talks about his past. His dream is to get a large diamond and leave Africa. There is an incident and a shooting! Troops will pacify the area, civilians will be evacuated (no witnesses). Danny is obsessed with getting a pink diamond. Danny and Solomon run back, there is danger when they are discovered, but they escape. Danny calls in the location of the Rebel Camp to the Government Troops. Solomon watches the boy soldiers, there is a mistake! He is threatened with horrors unless he finds that hidden diamond. Airplanes attack the camp, kill them all! Solomon is enraged. Troops on the ground complete the slaughter. Now the Colonel wants that diamond; he knows about Solomons son

Will there be a double-cross? There is a surprise! Solomon can take his son home. Danny calls for the small airplane to take him away. Danny was wounded, he returns the diamond to Solomon so he can leave with his son. More soldiers approach, there is more shooting. Danny makes a phone call to Matty. Solomon gets his wife and child back, then calls for the rough diamond. Later he speaks at a press conference against looting a countrys resources. It is up to the customers to demand diamonds that are not illegal. [Does a cartel want to keep prices high and avoid competition from lower priced diamonds?]

This movie exposes the horrors of civil war in Sierra Leone, but doesnt go into the details (a book would provide more information). The smuggling and import of these diamonds competes with the South African diamond cartel. Diamonds are Forever is an earlier movie.",1423353600,,3272,4.825311942959002

I give it only 3 stars because the story and character development are rather shallow and superficial.  In particular the movie avoids actually naming the persons and organizations who drive the diamond industry - a rich history to be told!  But they spare the villains, thus leaving the moviegoer with little additional understanding of the whole situation with mining in Africa.  To achieve a deeper story and understanding they should have had Leonardo narrate more over different scenes (like the way he did in the movie, The Beach, which was awesome).

646324,5,6303365752,"Director Edward Zwick's often graphic, but all-too-realistic offering coincided with a ""60 Minutes"" report on conflict diamonds in Africa.
 Here, Zwick takes us to the  war-torn Sierra Leone of 1999 where war lords terrorize rural populations chopping off extremities of many so they will be unable to vote, and enslaving many to mine diamonds to finance their conflicts, killing those who protest by trying to hide the diamonds they find from their captors.
 Among those simply trying to  survive the ordeal is fisherman Solomon Vandy(a loving, dignified unless otherwise provoked, Oscar-nominee Djimon Hounsu, still as much the beautiful bit of dark hot chocolate that he was when he appeared in a Janet Jackson video a decade earlier), a family man who is proud of his son, Dia's ( Kagiso Kuypers) scholastic efforts and hopes the boy will be a doctor. His wife, Jassie (Benu Mabhena) tends to the children, including a baby and an older daughter, N'Yanda (Anointing Lukola).
  The terrorist group, Revolution United Front(RUF),  is led by a villainous war lord, Captain Poison (David Harewood) who forces Solomon, abducted during  an RUF raid on his village, to work in an illicit diamond mine. There, amid much violence, Solomon successfully finds and hides a pink diamond of considerable size, and during the chaos of a government raid on the mine, managed  to wrap it in a piece of cloth and bury it in the ground. He has another confrontation with the evil Captain Poison, and may soon regret not having killed him at that moment.
  Elsewhere in the country, a Rhodesian gun runner named Danny Archer(a well-tanned intense, and Oscar nominated Leonardo Di Caprio, who has the Afrikaans accent down pat) who is hoping to find a diamond to sell in order to leave Africa. We observe the 31-year-old loner as he makes his contacts among the locals, and in a brief jaunt to South Africa with Colonel Coetzee(Arnold Vosloo), who trained  him when he joined the Army, and taught him the practice of diamond smuggling.
 During an encounter with one Captain Rambo(Ato Essando), Archer ends up under arrest  for diamond smuggling, but it is behind bars where he encounters Solomon, incarcerated for  illegal diamond mining hears the similarly incarcerated Poison accuse Solomon of  hiding a diamond, which, for his own safety, Solomon denies, even stripping down to prove his point.
 Archer gets himself and Vandy out of prison ( Poison will be sprung in due time as well), realizing the latter may be of some use to him. They escape to Guinea.
  Side by side, Hounsu and DiCaprio are a walking lesson in genetics, with dominant, dark and formidable Hounsu towering over the six-foot DiCaprio, whose tanned complexion, lemony dirty blonde hair, expressive ocean-blue eyes, and intensely colored mouth--half Cupid's bow, half rose petal, and all sumptuousness, are equally photogenic.
 As Solomon's family are fleeing to a refugee camp, Dia is kidnapped by the RUF.
 In the meantime, at a bar on a beach, Danny meets American journalist, Maddy Bowen(Jennifer Connally), who has overheard his conversation with the bartender (Ntare Mwime) about the illicit diamond trade. She is trying  to do a report on the trading  of conflict diamonds, but needs credible sources for her stories. Archer warns her of the danger involved for him as well as herself in getting and reporting such information.
 But the three leads will combine for the purposes of their mutual interests.
 Solomon's wife tells him of Dia's abduction when he sees her at a refugee camp, and he vows to find him.
 We view the RUF's  indoctrination tactics for the child soldiers and see Dia being given drugs as he joins their ranks and commits atrocities.
 For Maddy, Solomon, and Danny, the journey is often antagonistic as well as dangerous as motives are attacked, insults hurled, and two of them eventually come to blows.
 They manage to placate the local militia, and find a temporary respite at an orphanage where many former child soldiers, and child amputees are rehabilitated by one Benjamin Kapany(Basil Wallace).
 A potential romance ensues between Danny and  Maddy as they discuss the impact wars have had on both of their lives, and Danny discusses both the political situation and the brutality that left him orphaned at  age nine. Palpable anguish washes over Danny's face as an empathetic Maddy reaches out to him.
 Soon they are traveling again with Benjamin escorting them. An RUF attack results in Benjamin's being wounded and treated at an Army encampment where Danny reunites with Colonel Coetzee.
 Maddy is apprehensive about Danny and Solomon's decision  to travel to the danger zone to retrieve both Dia and the diamond, but departs with the  list of credible sources for her report that Danny reluctantly gave her, and she in return, gives Danny her contact information.
 To Solomon's consternation, Danny sets the pace for their trek into the RUF camp, and after a faux pas by Solomon, threatens to kill him if  makes any more dangerous mistakes. But the single and childless Danny comes to empathize with Solomon as an anxious father, and aids him in his struggle to free Dia, as will Colonel Coetzee. There is a calmer moment where a father expresses his hopes for his son, and Hounsu, like DiCaprio, rewards the viewer with the brilliance of his smile.
 What follows is a scenario familiar for DiCaprio--an orphaned adventurer encountering a rare diamond, facing calamity, sacrificing himself for the greater good, and expressing gratitude for meeting a prospective love interest before finding a permanent sense of peace.
 As Rudolf van de Kaap, and Rupert Simmons, Marius Weyers and Michael Sheen are the van de Kaap Diamond Company's corrupt representatives. Stephen Collins' Ambassador Walker helps bring this story to its conclusion.
  This formidable film brought further international attention to a timely issue, and was the perfect vehicle for both the Beninese Hounsu and a humanitarian of DiCaprio's caliber to lend their talents.",1403049600,,6032,5.069908814589666
646325,4,6303365752,"This movie is a good one. I love movies like this that open westerners eyes to the things that happen in other countries specifically Africa, which many say ""God has left.""",1402531200,,172,4.580645161290323
646326,3,6303365752,"The charitable way in which to look at this well-put-together  and often visually spectacular movie is to see it as an infomercial: as informing your average moviegoer that the mining, export, and sale of diamonds is tied up with some absolutely horrible circumstances, when the profits from the traffic -- often carried out by shady characters and untransparent institutions -- are used to finance one side or another in a civil war in an African country, in this case Sierra Leone in 1999. It's important to get that message out, and the particular horror that is highlighted here, beyond the indiscriminate killing and general violence of a civil war, is the impressing, training, and use of child soldiers in a civil war.  The parts of the movie that show how kids are scared, brainwashed, and dehumanized by adults posing as their new ""family"" now that their old families are ostensibly dead are chilling and effective.

Unfortunately, Edward Zwick resorts to some standard Hollywood tropes as the vehicles for his well-meaning effort here.  First, there is the family-separation-and-reunion trope.  The family of Solomon Vandy (Djimon Honsou) is torn apart: Solomon is forced to become a diamond miner and his son is taken, a little later, to be a child soldier.  Conveniently for the plot, the brutal revolutionary leader who sees Solomon hiding a huge raw diamond that he has found later is involved in the brutalization of Solomon's son Dia and seeks eventually to use him to pressure Solomon into getting him the diamond.  The movie ends with the reunion of Solomon's family in a manner beloved of Hollywood.  They seem to have resiliently bounced back from the degradation to a point at which the humble fisherman Solomon can give a speech about diamond trafficking at an international conference.  Honsou can do the dignified simple black African to great effect, so handkerchiefs are required for that reunion scene.  More vivid, but still a bit of a cliche, is the scene where Solomon talks his son out of killing him by recalling him to his ""real"" --i. e. good -- self.  It's one of these scenes that are effective, even though it's manipulative.  Solomon, it has to be said, is allowed his moment of wildness as he beats his son's brutalizer to death with a shovel (in the middle of a rocket attack on the diamond mine that seems to leave everybody dead but the principals).

The other worn Hollywood trope is that of the cynical self-serving man redeemed by the love of a good woman and the example of people who are genuinely noble and selfless.  The cynic is Danny Archer (Leonardo Di Caprio), a white Zimbabwean former mercenary who is up to his ears in the traffic of diamonds.  His employer seems to be (at several removes) a prestigious diamond company, and Danny will get whatever they want and cares only that he gets a good cut.  Di Caprio, complete with what sounds like a South African accent, is perfectly effective in what is, for much of the movie, an action-hero kind of role.  I was surprised at how well he handled the role -- I didn't know he could crawl, run, dodge bullets, and shoot with the best of them.  The noble exemplar who turns him into a kind of martyr is Solomon.  The good woman he falls in love with (after the standard rocky start) is Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), a reporter whose relationship with Danny enables her to break the story of ""blood diamonds"" (and the connivance by European and American businesses in the traffic) that makes part of the uplifting climax of the movie.

In addition to these familiar elements, there is the action movie element: lots of guns, explosions, narrow escapes, tense confrontations, all well shot but all pretty standard, except for the presence of the child soldiers, whose presence reminds us of more disturbing things.  What I've called the ""Hollywood""-ish elements belong to the world of entertainment and easy sentiment.  I give the movie 3.5 stars because I think it means well and isn't just exploitive.  Compared to ""Hotel Rwanda,"" though, it seems hyped-up and relatively crude, for all the sureness with which it's put together.",1401840000,,4132,4.854700854700854

646565,5,6303365752,"We have had this film on our shelf for years and felt reluctant to watch it.  Now that we have, I can see why:  it is stark, unrelentingly brutal, and relevant in a political sense, i.e. not entertainment, but activist.  Most amazing of all, in spite of the fact that Jennifer Connelly is simply too beautiful to be credible, it is never over the top, but realistic throughout.  The acting is uniformly excellent, particularly Dicaprio, whom I have always thought is under-rated.

The story takes place during a civil war, in which child soldiers are stolen from African villages to aid in the hunt for black market diamonds mined by slaves.  This is a thing that is horrible to witness, indeed I thanked my lucky stars many times in the watching.  It follows the course of 2 men and is quite surprising - to the point that I think the viewer should discover the plot and characters without spoilers.

What I will say about the story is that it culminates in the Kimberly Process, an agreement on how to regulate diamond markets.  This is an issue I have written about, the efforts of countries (and companies) to incentivize ethical trade.  It is interesting and relevant, and this film provides an emotional backdrop to why we should concern ourselves.

I would recommend this for serious viewers who want to understand the world and what we have made.  It takes a strong stomach and is not enjoyable, so you may want only to rent this rather than own it.  But it is moving and necessary.",1395360000,,1490,4.619771863117871

The story is extremely tight and brilliantly written invoking all kinds of emotions within audience members. Symbolically this film runs deep with themes of greed, loyalty and compassion.  I took a lot away from it and it certainly gave a me a whole new perspective on diamond sale and trade.  Perhaps when considering a gem in the future I will opt for something else.  My reason for not giving this Amazon review the full 5 stars has nothing to due with the picture and everything to due with the transfer. The transfer on this film was merely average and not what I would expect from Warner Brothers.  Perhaps the original source elements weren't altogether there, but this film could have really benefited from a sharper transfer.

From What's Eating Gilbert Grape to this movie and others, his acting ability continuously surprises me. When I really first saw him in Titanic, I thought he was another adolescent girls dream. But with subsequent viewing of various movies I now appreciate his acting ability.
To cut it short and save the plot for others to see, in Blood Diamond, he essentially plays a soldier of fortune who succumbs to the nobler aspects of humanity by helping another person. By the movies end, you see that he is tied to Africa not only by situation but by his being. He is who he is and Africa will always be in him. Great acting by him (with accent) and his co-lead, Djimon Hounsou. I even thought that Jennifer Connelly was good as well- at times a bit over the top, but good none the less.

647363,5,6303365752,"This account by Edward Zwick leaves a profound impact. Realistically, there cannot be a stop to the Blood Diamonds or to the torture and human slavery that has become entrenched in the African mining and processing life. Rich guys with stars in their eyes give these stones to their girlfriends. A diamond is much sought after; but, there is more bad than good that is mixed in their polish. A diamond has become the bane of so many people's lives in Africa.
The United Nations has defined a conflict diamond as one that originates from areas controlled by factions who are opposed to the internationally recognized governments. Conflict diamonds come out of areas at war or engrossed in armed conflicts.
Fifteen per cent of the diamonds from the conflict zones are sold to the United States and the money is used to buy weapons for the RUF, a guerilla unit that governs all the mines in the conflict areas.
Edward Zwick has taken Sierra Leone of 1999 as his locale and spun a tale that involves a Mende fisherman, Solomon Vandy, who hides a big pink while working as a slave in the mines when his family is taken captive by the Republic United Front guerillas. His relationship with a South African mercenary, Danny Archer, forms the principal part of the tale.
Whenever a diamond is found, it brings with it inevitable death as Zwick tries to tell us. The G8 countries have collectively raped Africa out of its rubber, gold, oil and diamonds. The film also invites its audience to look into the Kimberley Process of January 2003 when forty nations signed a pact to look into the evils behind the conflict diamonds.
What comes out brilliantly in this film are the scenes of human torture in the sweltering heat among the diamond mines and how a mercenary and a journalist, Maddy Bowen, help the fisherman reunite with his family.
Leonardo di Caprio, Djimon Hounsou, Jennifer Connelly and Arnold Vosloo shine in this film. This is one of the best I have seen in recent years. I will rate it AAAA.
Certain dialogues from the film cannot escape you. Archer to Maddy: `For the record, I would like to be kissed first before I am f***ed'; `God definitely is not interested in Africa; He left Africa along time ago.'`This is TIA (this is Africa) magic! Solomon Vandy (to his son):`You are Mende and a good boy;do not learn what those brutes taught you;you have to walk to school to learn English; it is important for you to become a doctor.'Maddy to Archer: `You don't care about his(Solomon's) family; you are using him for the stone.'Edward Zwick has made a profound statement with this film. Djimon Hounsou is superb as Solomon Vandy. What can I say about Jennifer Connelly? I would fall in love with her ten times over and in whichever age. Leonardo di Caprio is outstanding as Danny Archer. He has gone under the skin of the role with his Rhodesian accent mastered to perfection and with nuances suggestive of a mercenary who has been brought up in ruthless and cut-throat circumstances. Ever since I saw him as Jack Dawson in `Titanic', I have been impressed with his performances in films like Beach, Romeo and Juliet, Man in the Iron Mask, Gangs of New York, the Departed,Catch me if you Can, Aviator, Shutter Island, Inception, J. Edgar and Django Unchained. The juries behind Oscars and Golden Globes have been ungrateful in recognizing his skills. They have acted as imbeciles in ignoring his talent and not giving him due recognition. I feel that he deserved  at least an Oscar so far. He leaves a haunting impression on you in Blood Diamond.",1364601600,,3549,4.705787781350482

I don't have the Standard Definition DVD so this is not a comparison.  The video transfer appears quite clean with a very warm coloration, no artifacts or aliasing to be seen.  There is little to no grain that is noticeable and there are plenty of details in the dark and shadow areas.  Since I have not seen the SD DVD, I cannot make a comparison between the two but I am sure that there is some upgrading with the  Blu Ray version though I doubt there would be a night and day difference.  On the negative side, I noticed that the bit rate was low and, for the first hour at least, varied between 8 and 20mbps.  That's pretty low for a Blu Ray transfer but the imaging did not appear to suffer.

The audio defaults to DD 5.1 so be sure to go to the audio menu and choose the PCM 5.1 which is lossless.  The audio levels are all proper without any roller coster effect to the volume.  For the first 45 minutes of the film, almost all the audio is on the front stage without any real use of the sub or rear stage.  However, with the first firefight and thereafter, there are plenty of opportunities for discreet use of the rear and side channels and the uncompressed audio does make use of them.  Your LFE channel will also be frequently brought into play.  For the most part, the rear channels are used for ambience but when used discreetly, they really add to the film.

There are more extras than I can list here and all appear worthy of watching over a long period of time.  There really are many.  Thankfully, there are no preview ads for other movies.

All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.
Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.

If you have a conscience and a good heart it will make you think twice about wanting diamonds instead of opting for CZ or the like. Leonardo is very good and conviencing as a self-centered, greedy guy with a conscience and a good heart- deep down inside. But is it strong enough to make him do the right thing? The other actors in this movie are believable as well in what their mission is and how they feel about the diamond trade business in African and killing for it. At times it's hard to take the horrific scenes of violience; mostly because you know that really happened and still happens today. The price of diamonds is like the price of oil/gas, but is it worth killing and dying and going to war about them? Are diamonds really as necessary to have as oil/gas? It's the kind of movie that really gets you involved with what is happening to the characters and after the movie is over it sticks with you-in your mind and heart- and you want to talk with someone who has seen the movie.

A thriller with a strong human element--a story that exposes the ugly reality of the diamond industry. Blood Diamond takes us to the ground where War lords enlist children to be their soldiers and men to be their slaves. DiCaprio plays Danny Archer, an unsavory diamond smuggler, whose paths cross with Solomon Vandy, a simple fisherman and a reporter (played by Jennifer Connelly). His world turns upside when he lets his conscience get the better of himself and once selfish unlawful criminal, now becomes the reluctant hero.

And the so called ""certified conflict-free"" gemstones have been proven time and again to NOT be conflict-free.  That's a lie.

647864,4,6303365752,"I enjoyed this entertaining and informative film.  The acting was done very well, and the characters were developed enough that you were pulled through the film's grittiest and most violent scenes.  I usually opt to fast-forward through the tough scenes in these types of movies because the gore always outweighed whatever dialogue I might miss.  That was not the case for me during this film.  It was heart wrenching watching little boys, some no older than my oldest daughter, carrying weapons, being forced into doing drugs and alcohol, and killing anyone who opposed the rebels in their attempts to overthrow the current government, all in the name of greed and tyranny.  I hope that people watch this film and takes its message about conflict diamonds to heart.  While this is a dramatization of the events during that time, the issues and the warfare that it caused, were real.

My one and only true complaint was that I wasn't able to watch in HD, even though I had purchased the HD version.  About 20 minutes into the film I started having difficulties with ""buffering,"" which is not something I usually encounter, and Amazon has a screening feature when you purchase HD versions, to determine whether or not you are capable of viewing the items in HD.  My system passed the screening (and always does), but I still had problems once I really got into the film and had to switch to the non-HD version.

So, while this was a great film that I would recommend everyone to see, especially if you are interested in world affairs, I was not happy with the quality of the HD playback.  Purchase a hard-copy of the Blueray instead.",1346716800,,1632,4.731448763250883

It's a movie everyone should watch at one point, it's really eye-opening and gives you a different thought on the lives we have, and how lucky we are to have it.

647866,4,6303365752,"Edward Zwick's ""Blood Diamond"" (2006) takes place in the late 90s during the Sierra Leone Civil War between government soldiers and rebel forces. The title refers to diamonds mined in African war zones and sold to finance conflicts, thereby profiting warlords and diamond companies worldwide. The film depicts many of the atrocities of this war, including the rebels' amputating people's hands to discourage them from voting in upcoming elections (!). Yes, this is shocking, but as the characters say in the movie: TIA. That is, ""This is Africa.""

The story involves Rhodesian Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a man with a haunted past who has made himself a key player in the business of conflict diamonds. Amidst the extreme political unrest he meets the beautiful Maddy (Jennifer Connelley), an American journalist who actually cares about what's happening, and Solomon (Djimon Hounsou), an honest African fisherman whose son has been taken by the rebels to be brainwashed and fight for their cause. Archer's sole interest in Solomon is that the fisherman knows were a huge blood diamond is buried, which could be Archer's ticket out of Africa.

I'll be perfectly honest with you, I didn't know anything about this civil war or `blood diamonds' until seeing ""Blood Diamond,"" so the film is successful just by being educational.

Although the story takes place in Sierra Leone (coastal northwest Africa) the film was shot in Mozambique (coastal southeast Africa) and South Africa. Regardless, the locations and cinematography are excellent, as is the score.

Although the story is only moderately engaging and moving, the acting by the principles is great. We are treated to an interesting moral conundrum with Archer. Will he selfishly steal the blood diamond or keep his word and split the profits with Solomon? Will he continue to justify his part in perpetuating the problem of blood diamonds or will he risk his life by unveiling what he knows so Maddy can get the news out? Dicaprio is notable in the role. But the best character, by far, is the undefiled Solomon; the film successfully makes the viewer cheer for him and his cause.

The film runs 143 minutes.

FINAL WORD: This is a solid political thriller and educational to boot.

647867,3,6303365752,"Last night's bargain rack DVD for late night viewing was ""Blood Diamond."" I'd never heard of the movie but I bought it because it had a banner on the front that said it had five academy award nominations. I figured that it must be a good movie. Well, I can understand the nominations as it was very well done in a variety of ways.

I didn't care for ""Blood Diamond"" and I'd advise people against watching it unless they have a high tolerance for extreme violence. Actually, I have nothing particularly against violence in films and I see a lot of it in action movies and the like which are more like cartoons than the real thing. But the violence in this film was from beginning to end and involved everyone including hapless women and children. This wasn't a fantasy cartoon. This was the real thing and my heart went out to the people of Sierra Leone and other places like it. Extreme brutality was everywhere. I have no idea what the body count of the dead and wounded might have been but I'd guess it was in the thousands, Did I mention the torture, personal degradation and the destruction of property? Death, destruction and mayhem were just an ongoing and integral part of the entire movie, and it had a point in that the control of diamond mining in a country undergoing civil strife was involved. Greed seemed to be the dominant emotion everywhere.

The acting was quite good. The people, even the minor bit players, seemed real, unfortunately. The cinema was excellent and it was very interesting to see this part of Africa, except for the extreme ongoing violence. The movie was nicely paced and flowed along without any dull spots. I thought the story was contrived to make a bold statement against diamond mining, diamond smuggling and the diamond industry, in general. Well, I've never been a friend of the highly controlled diamond industry so it was good to see them take a little heat. They earned it. But to me, the total effect of the movie was negative. I ended up feeling as if I had watched a very well done and sophisticated piece of propaganda. When I see a good movie, I sometimes mull over it for the next few days. In this case, I find myself trying to get it out of my mind.

""Blood Diamond"" is a good movie but on the whole rather mediocre in every aspect. The cast is quite fine and one normally would expect more from Leo and Jennifer, but they are severely handicapped by poor screenplay here. The dialogue is highly unremarkable and forgettable. The most poignant scenes wonderfully avoid sentimentality but, as a kind of side effect, miss the real pathos too.

A great deal of the movie consists of violence under the form of shooting people as if they were made for target practice. I understand this is an important part of modern Africa which must be told in all its brutality, and in this respect the movie serves its purpose very well, but I think less bloodshed and more substance would have been a better solution.

This movie is sure to tug on some heart strings and make you feel the pain that actual people have experienced half way around the world.

The Quote mentioned above is a perfect motto/message for what this movie stands for. Diamonds have been known to be found in certain parts of Africa. Big Companies, Establishments, Business men etc ... All have set up an eye to get the best of Diamonds in order to sell it for the rich and willing therefore making themselves one of the richest people in the world. But Diamond trading is more than just an 'honorable' Business, in a matter of fact its far from being 'honorable'. Sometimes people will do anything to get these stones, the wealth and fortune it brings with it even killing and turning against their own blood.

Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) like many other Native Africans lives a poor living as a fishermen but he's a simple man and a caring family man who has an Optimistic view on life as long as he have his family around and can provide the basic needs to survive nothing in the world should matter much 'even the political and the constant war troubles in Africa'. However life turns upside down for him, once the rebels ""RUF"" attack his village they not only burn his house and held him captive they also separate him from his family and soon enough he finds himself in a camp digging for diamonds in order to sponsor weapons for the anti-government who were the source of his misery. While he is digging he finds a 'large' and 'rare' diamond, In it Solomon sees his 'possible' escape from the camp so he buries it secretly where no one can find it.

Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a white - African ex soldier who works currently as a diamond smuggler for one of the biggest Diamond Companies on the market. However in exchange for some money and Military protection Danny has sold his soul to the devil, he is also under the threat of getting shot and killed everyday enough to make him tire of his life. So, he wants to get out of Africa and go somewhere else, a place where he don't have to kill and get shot at constantly a place where he can be at 'peace' However to do that he needs the money.

Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is an American Journalist who is investigating the Diamond trade in Africa or what's also known as the 'Blood Diamond' trade and is seeking the truth, she is sure that there is some illegal activities involving the Diamond Business but the problem is she got no proof to back up her story.

The three meet and they all need each other to get what they want or to achieve a purpose. Solomon wants his family and old life back again but he can't do it without the help of Danny Archer who is willing to help him if and only if he would lead him to the Rare Diamond he buried, However he too can't do this without the help of Mandy Bowen who as a journalist has access to certain places but she also has a price in return she wants Danny to provide her with information and documents about the 'hidden truth' involving the Diamond business.

This movie is Emotional and really gripping. I Like it when Hollywood makes Strong Movies like that who explain the hardship of life and Open the eyes of people to what's really happening in the world and how Greed has filled some souls with hatred and bitterness as well as destructed other people's lives.

The Acting was superb also. You got amazing performances from the lead actors. Its really easy to see why Leonardo DiCaprio has gotten an Oscar nomination for this role, I thought it was well-deserved even if he lost but hey not all spot lights are shined on DiCaprio Djimon Hounsou does an Excellent job at playing the native African American who is just like many others a mere Victim in a cruel world.

I really enjoyed this movie. Its much more than I expected. So believe the reviews they are true and not Overrated.

All the actors play their roles well and the locations make for some stunning scenery. The storyline is pretty shocking at times and it feels like it is half action movie and half political commentary. The issues around blood diamonds are explained pretty well and it'll make you think twice about those innocuous sparkly stones that we see everywhere. As other reviewers have noted, the film is excellent, but the sanitised, saccharine Hollywood ending spoils what is a powerful film, with an important message. Overall though, I'd say this film is well worth watching, it will keep you engaged the whole way through and is well shot and acted. A directors cut without the last five minutes would be great!

If I hadn't already seen documentaries on this subject, I might not have believed it could be this bad. Not one for conventional jewelry myself, still I certainly look at precious stones much differently.

It is riddled with violent warring factions, street shootings, espionage, betrayals and the helplessness of the innocents caught up in it. At the center of it all, a large pink diamond in-the-rough; the cost for it to adorn someone's neck being far too high. Actors DiCaprio and Hounson do a superb job with their roles.

Hounson's character says he had heard his people being told they were better off when the white's ruled. I think they were better off before whites ever came, having brought capitalism in the extreme. Africa by right, belongs to Africans.

The speech made by a politician at the end summed it up well. I wish more movies like this were also made about the fur, animal souvenir and live-animal trades as well (such as 'Gorillas in the Mist').

648158,5,6303365752,"Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Connelly and Djimon Hounsou, Blood Diamond is set in Sierra Leone in 1999 amid the chaos of Africa in armed conflict. It is an action drama played against the backdrop of political turmoil. The movie is about the illegal trafficking of diamonds in Africa. Although it is tricky to make a movie on a controversial issue that is neither do-gooder nor exploitative, in this case the effort is surprisingly successful.

Blood diamonds were so named in the 1990s to call attention to the fact that African diamonds were being smuggled out of countries at war specifically to buy more arms and kill more people.

Weaker moments in the story are overshadowed by the film's willingness to risk disturbing an audience's sense of the world and how it is run. Blood Diamond is very much aware that these are problems beyond an easy resolution, and making a film that understands that is quite an accomplishment.

Zwick knows how to direct and the actions scenes hold your attention, De Caprio plays his part well and Djimon Hounsou (Gladiator) offers the audience a role that is reasonably believable. The problem is that it all falls apart at the end, when Hollywood takes over....I don't want to say more, given you may not have seen the movie yet....It is worth seeing...just not more than once....or twice

648301,4,6303365752,"Blood Diamond is one of those ""Public Awareness"" films that accomplishes its goal without relying on much preaching. In a way you could easily classify Blood Diamond as being a Hotel Rwanda film for audience members who aren't in the mood for pure drama.  So instead the issues are mixed into a classy, well thought out action thriller.  More recently we saw this concept used well in District 9, which addressed the issue of racism, slums, and xenophobia in South Africa.  This contemporary method of informing the public often turns in good films when done right and Blood Diamond does it right.

Though not the greatest film dealing with conflict in Africa it draws enormous amounts of strength from  Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Housou (both earned Academy Award nominations for their roles) who play a mismatched pair that has to work together.  DiCaprio is Danny Archer, a white mercenary (who specializes in smuggling conflict diamonds to fund private wars) from Rhodesia (modern day Zimbabwe) who feels that by getting his hands on a rare ""blood diamond"" he will have enough money to leave Africa and retire.  This diamond has been found, but the only one who knows of its location is the man who found it: Solomon Vandy (Housou).  Vandy's son has been abducted by the guerrilla forces and after escaping slavery at the hands of the rebel group he meets Archer and makes an agreement that he will help him find the diamond, but only if he assists in rescuing his son.

A wonderful film with the expert direction of Edward Zwick, Blood Diamond is a good film. I suppose my only gripe with the film would be its lack of concentration in regards to the conditions of Sierra Leone. Some things are just simply skimmed over, such as the issue of child soldiers, which I thought was one of the main issues the film was supposed to address. I don't know if this has to do with regulations on what you show children do on screen or what, but it definitely felt as if it was cut short.

Regardless, this is a tight film that gets its message across while remaining an engaging, entertaining thriller. DiCaprio and Hounsou were at their very best in each scene.",1269388800,,2159,4.6878306878306875
648302,4,6303365752,"Blood Diamond (2006) is an outstanding action movie, with a heavy
sentimental story running parallel, involving a mercenary and a
diamond smuggler formerly  of the South African army (played by
Leonardo DiCaprio to perfection, including accent) with a variety of
individuals, initially apart, but eventually interconnected
considering the extent of their interaction and the length of the
actual movie.

In this particular case, David Harewood is entirely convincing as a
guerrilla commander, as is Jennifer Connelly playing a thin, single,
young American news reporter.  Arnold Vosloo is the mercenary
commander, who is able to overthrow entire ruling governments of
sovereign nations on a moment's notice, from his brigade strength
military force comprising helicopters, modern weaponry and logistics
of all kinds, in between arms deals worldwide.

From a didactic point of view, the script is entirely successful, as
it brings into focus the monumental scale of refugee camps, family
powerlessness, homelessness, poverty, anarchy and chaos found in
civil wars in Africa.

A running theme, is that to survive in each and every situation, at
least 5 to 10 years of professional military service is necessary,
most of it seen in combat, deployment and action. Rocket launchers,
AK-47, mortar, IED's, sniper fire, pistol firefights are a constant,
as much in the downtown areas as in the country side and dense
jungles. It shows the ease of recruiting  orphan children 10  years
of age into a guerrilla, through the usual military hazing and
indoctrination, socialization to bring about in them extreme values,
behaviors, and a trigger-happy mentality. The sheer number of troops
shooting to thrill with large caliber machine guns mounted on the
back of a pickup trucks never ceases to amaze, as are the number of
bloodbaths of innocent civilian men, women and children.

The diamond labor camp in and of itself is not entirely surprising
considering the reduimentary  mining techniques also used in North
America 100 to 200 years ago. The disguises, bogus identities used
in Africa are also the norm, as nobody is ever really who they claim
to be, politicians being CIA undercover agents, journalists being
arms  or gem smugglers, etc.

From an acting point of view, DiCaprio has honed his technique
immensely, never losing his grip on the character, accent and
ability in demonstrating the desperation of a smuggler who needs to
close his last, ultimate diamond deal, with a number of
international parties, laundering diamonds and gems as easily as
cash. Connolly's approach is also interesting, from an eagerness in
being sexier and more provocative  than shy and reserved. The
quality and number of the supporting actors is also remarkable,
assisting in maintaining the suspense and viewers on the edge of
their seats.

From a soundtrack perspective, s fair bit is reminiscent of the
world music heard on Jean Luc Ponty's Tchokola, while the
cinematography is flawless, sharp, never dull or boring except for a
number of quieter moments, bringing into focus time and again the
beauty of various landscapes in Western Africa, appealing to the
sentimentality of viewers.

The picture deserved a perfect score, with the only difference that
it forgot that it was an entertainment vehicle in its final moments,
switching gears to a paternalistic, moralizing, and preaching tone,
erasing the right of viewers to independent thought and opinion,
suggesting they swallow the United Nations outlook hook, line and
sinker concerning diamonds and arms trade. Another weakness is the
oversimplification of the problems in the region, laying the blame
squarely on the doorstep of a diamond mania.

In sum, this is a remarkable and unique release, from the acting,
scenes, music and entertainment value, and the humanity of the
people that shines through despite the horrors of civil wars time
and again.",1266364800,,3895,5.290113452188007

648431,1,6303365752,"I had a feeling from the critical response and the trailers alone that I wasn't going to like this movie much.  I am a fan of DiCaprio and I actually like Connelly despite her lack of range, and both actors had impressed me already this very year (`The Departed' and `Little Children' also being released in 2006) and so I was at least hoping they would elevate this film for me (although the spotty and awkward accent donned by DiCaprio was even distracting in the trailer).  I have lost the faith I once had in Hounsou, the one I have now knighted Sir Screamsalot.

So, it's safe to say I expected this to be underwhelming.

I didn't expect to see ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN though!

I don't know if there is enough time in the world for me to express all that I find distasteful about this wretched film, and I don't know if I would want to subject any self-respecting reader to my tirade (nor do I think you would have the patience to bare with me on this one) so I'm going to try and be as brief as I can be.

The film attempts to shed light on a very dark and troubling epidemic of sorts in Africa.  The harrowing truth behind conflict diamonds is heartbreaking and cruel and completely devastating.  That is lost in this mess of a film.  It gets lost in pointless violence (don't even try and justify this) and awkward speeches.  It gets lost in aimless direction and clich&eacute;d performances.  In fact, there is nothing to commend about this film.  The only thing that is worthy of mention is the message the film is trying to relay; the problem being that it just doesn't relay it well.

Danny Archer is a selfish diamond smuggler who wants a giant raw diamond found by fisherman Solomon Vandy who has recently escaped enslavement by a ruthless rebel leader.  Maddy Bowen is a journalist who wants Archer to give her the inside scoop on the diamond smuggling operations.

Vandy uses Archer to get his family (war torn) while Archer uses Vandy to get the stone while Dowen uses Archer to get her story.

The film isn't quite certain where it wants to be.  I remember similar issues with `Beyond Borders' and I see a similarity here (although that film is far from this horrible).  The film is essentially a mindless action film that decides to (awkwardly) insert messages of enlightenment to the viewer.  In between countless scenes of bloodshed and screaming there is a fact driven monologue of how these stones are transported, and then there is more screaming and bullets.  The film opens with violence and it ends with it.  I remember looking at my wife and rolling my eyes about halfway through the film because it seemed as though no one could get through a single conversation without dodging a bullet.  It was relentless and it took away HEAVILY from the films core.

I also felt that the interactions between characters felt forced and unnatural.  This is a result of poor scripting (the definition of POOR!), but it is also a direct result of lazy acting.  The standout here is Hounsou, and not in a good way.  His idea of acting is a simplistic approach.  When he is sad is cries.  When he is angry he screams.  When he is happy he smiles.  That is all.  Apparently he is mad a lot because all he does here is SCREAM, SCREAM, SCREAM.  It is so over-the-top and irritatingly ridiculous.  DiCaprio suffers from an awkward accent and insufferable dialog (I mean ""bling bang""?  Really?) but he actually portrays the emotions correctly (and I was happy that he remained selfish throughout most of the film).  Connelly is a boring stereotype here, enough said.

The script was just a hodgepodge of unrealistic encounters and scattered bullet fire.  The way Archer approaches Vandy, the way Vandy jeopardizes his life and the life of his son MORE THAN ONCE, the way Bowen chokes up on the phone...it ALL READS FALSE and ridiculously manipulative.

The only (small) redeeming factor (no redemption really, just a well played part) is anything involving Kagiso Kuypers, who plays Dia, Vandy's missing son.  His scenes are a powerful testament to the darkness that engulfs this epidemic.  Sadly, his scenes are few and his presence is masked heavily by the horrific direction taken by Edward Zwick, whose haphazard vision single handedly botched what could have been a somewhat intelligent feature film.

What ruined it for me were the typical shoot-'em-up and chase scenes, where your star can manage to run in an open street while people are getting cut down left and right, yet manage to dodge bullets on more than one occasion.

And it starts to get ridiculous how many moving, beautifully acted scenes happen while the characters are supposed to be running for their lives. We pause for these interludes, then, when the characters have finished their emotionally charged moments, the bad guys, out of respect for these actors' close-ups, I guess, start charging after them again, and the action blasts on.

648590,4,6303365752,"Blood Diamond (Edward Zwick, 2006)

There are good actors and there are bad actors, but rarely has one person embodied both as well as Leonardo DiCaprio. And oddly, there's a sharp dividing line between the good and the bad, and that, of course, is Titanic. Before 1997, it seemed DiCaprio was incapable of making a bad movie. They weren't all brilliant by any stretch of the imagination (The Basketball Diaries, really), but he was always brilliant in them. Then came Titanic, as awful a blockbuster as has come down the pike in ages, and DiCaprio's career sank faster than that stupid boat. I spent nine years after that wondering what in the world had happened to the actor I'd once thought was the best thing since Johnny Depp. And then, my god, 2006. Leo, you are forgiven for every overblown and undertalented performance from Titanic to The Aviator for giving us The Departed and Blood Diamond in the same year. While, once again, neither was a great film, DiCaprio has once again shown the acting chops that made my jaw drop in such films as What's Eating Gilbert Grape?, Total Eclipse, and, yes, Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet.

For all that DiCaprio's presence was touted in this flick, however, he's not the main character. That would be Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou, recently of Push, nominated for an Oscar for his role here), a fisherman in Sierra Leone, by the Revolutionary United Front, rebels who are supporting their war against the government by the sale of blood diamonds (which these days go under the more euphemistic name of ""conflict diamonds""; of course, this removes us from the idea that people shed blood for them) and set to work in the diamond mines. While Solomon is working in the mines, two very big things happen: first, his son is also abducted by the RUF, and second, he finds a large, rare pink diamond and hides it from the RUF. Through various machinations, he is rescued from the mines and taken to prison in Freetown. Enter Danny Archer (DiCaprio), a Rhodesian mercenary involved in the arms-for-diamonds trade. He had a cache of diamonds taken from him when he was thrown into prison, and he's sure that his contact on the arms side of the deal, Colonel Coetzee (Fire & Ice's Arnold Vosloo), will be looking for reparation. He hears a guard from the mine taunting Vandy about the diamond, and comes up with a plan. This involves getting Vandy sprung from prison and offering to help him find his family again in exchange for the diamond. That requires the services of someone who knows how to find people, and in this case, that's reporter Maddy Bowen (Requiem for a Dream's Jennifer Connelly). Once the three of them get together, things start going wrong, not only among their little group, but with outside forces as well. Nothing can ever be easy--and let's not forget that while he doesn't know it, we know that Solomon's son Dia (Kagiso Kuypers in his first feature role) has also been taken by the RUF...

Perhaps the most interesting thing about this cast is that every major player is known for inconsistency in acting prowess. It's already been addressed in DiCaprio's case. Hounsou has been nominated for Academy Awards both for this and for In America, but, really. Constantine? Or even worse, Aragon? And for every Dark City and Requiem for a Dream, Connelly's resume, there's a Hulk. My hypothesis is that all three of them are more tractable for certain directors (though obviously I don't know this for sure). Zwick, of course, is a director well-known for pulling the last ounce of greatness out of an actor; after all, it was Zwick's Glory who took an affable TV and character actor named Denzel Washington and made him into an A-list superstar. His Leaving Normal was one of the highlights of Meg Tilly's acting career; Legends of the Fall, while not well-received upon release, has become an enduring favorite of Brad Pitt fans. This is a guy who knows what he's doing in the director's chair. Charles Leavitt's screenplay is both well-researched and snappy (though it's been said by some Sierra Leoneans who have seen the film that while it's generally accurate, it should be remembered that this sort of thing is only a small part of the greater story of the Sierra Leonean civil war), never degenerating into It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, Sierra Leonean style, as it so easily could. And Eduardo Serra's cinematography... oh, my. (I'll put it this way: it was good enough to get him tabbed as the cinematographer on Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Both parts.) James Newton Howard's score was nominated for a Grammy, for pete's sake. There are all kinds of reasons to appreciate this movie, and few to complain about it (the ending, coincidentally, puts one in mind of Double Indemnity, reviewed above, and has that same artificially-noble feel to it); even if you've always hated Leonardo DiCaprio's acting (and I have always found that those who do were unaware that he made movies before Titanic, which is kind of like not knowing about Keanu Reeves' pre-Bill and Ted output), this is one to check out. Maybe it'll change your mind, and let you see what the rest of us have known all along. ****",1246147200,,5173,4.758351893095768

He plays Danny Archer, a diamond smuggler and mercenary, who has made his livelihood engaging in activites that show him as a rather distatsteful charactor.  He is juxtaposed with Djimon Hounsou who plays Solomon Vandy, a man caught in the conflict of his country and Blood Diamonds.

Over the course of the movie Archer does change, and though portions were predictable, it was still well down.  There is violence throughout the movie, and some have criticized that the movie may have been a bit too ""moralistic"" in the telling of this tale.  To me it was just a very good story.  Despite any shortcomings, this movie is worth it just to see DiCaprio and Hounsou - both deliver stand out performances that are worth seeing and carry the movie.",1245024000,,929,4.628048780487805

This is a non-stop action film with a serious message, for the African nations really are suffering due to the blood diamonds (and indeed, mining of all kinds all over the world is still a very exploitative industry).

648700,4,6303365752,"For a movie that wears its social conscience on its sleeve, ""Blood Diamond"" never neglects little things like craftsmanship or genuinely sympathetic characters. Close filmic cousins would be ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" or ""Casablanca"" -- well-crafted stories in an exotic setting about characters in spiritual as well as physical crisis, where the tension between personal gain and the larger good is especially taut. I loved this movie for its heartfelt ambition, its sincerity, its intelligence, and for its revelatory performance by Leonardo DiCaprio.

I don't mention ""Treasure"" or ""Casablanca"" gratuitously. ""Blood Diamond's"" protagonist, diamond-smuggler Danny Archer (DiCaprio), would feel right at home at Rick's Cafe. A white South African survivor of apartheid, he's a seen-it-all cynic looking out for Number One; a Soldier of Fortune waiting for his one-way ticket off the Continent. That ticket arrives in the unlikely form of a modest, moral fisherman, Solomon Vandy (the always magnetic Djimon Hounsou), who has discovered a much-coveted ""Blood Diamond"" after being enslaved by mercenaries.

Danny and Solomon make an odd couple (with echoes of ""The Defiant Ones"") as they quest for the diamond that promises to free each from their respective captivity. Danny wants to cash in and check out. Solomon wants his family back. Will the Blood Diamond bring them what they seek? Their quest, and the moral questions the quest raises, are reminiscent of a John Huston film; whether ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" or ""The Man Who Would Be King,"" Huston was obsessed with ""the quest,"" that search for Life's meaning as embodied by some material aim: whether gold (""Treasure"") or the ""stuff that dreams are made of"" (""The Maltese Falcon"").

The search for paradise in war-ravaged Africa results in cynicism and despair. Danny says, in a rare moment of vulnerability, ""Sometimes I wonder... will God ever forgive us for what we've done to each other? Then I look around and I realize... God left this place a long time ago."" The point of ""Blood Diamond"" isn't that God is absent, but that God is present in the small acts of charity, the small moments of genuine humanity shared between the hopeless and the despairing. A character says, ""A moment of love, even in a bad man, can give meaning to a life. None of us knows whose path will lead us to God.""

None of us indeed. Do we fight for Good or Evil? Do we engender Misery or Hope? ""Blood Diamond"" reinforces the idea that each person has a choice, a free will, to do good or ill, to make right or wrong choices. Danny Archer and his character arc is the key to appreciating what is ultimately uplifting and life-affirming about this movie. I've always respected DiCaprio's acting chops, but his performance here is a masterful synthesis of all the talent and range he's shown elsewhere. By turns, Archer is devilishly charming, terrifyingly threatening, scrappily street-wise, and woundingly vulnerable. DiCaprio navigates these deep waters with an impressive lack of showboating. It's a fearless, gripping performance, and Leo deserved his Oscar nod. Slowly, by subtle degrees, he convinces you that Archer's hard shell thinly disguises someone desperate for redemption.",1235952000,,3233,5.152380952380953
648701,5,6303365752,"This is one of those movies that opens people's eyes to the truth behind diamonds.

Diamonds used to be valuable because they were so hard and because they were so hard to find.  With the discovery of many new diamond mines in Africa and elsewhere there are so many cut diamonds that they're only about as valuable as other semi-precious stones but because of a few entities like DeBeers who control diamond trade and actually hoard diamonds in vaults, they keep the prices high.  In hoarding diamonds though they not only keep the prices high, they also precipitate diamond wars - hence the term blood diamond where the currency that we exchange for diamonds is not just money but human life.

This movie hits you pretty hard and after it if you think about the world you live in it helps to shatters the world that you might have grown up with and you begin to wonder about those who control diamonds, oil, technology, sugar, coffee, alcohol, and you begin to wonder at how society is controlled today.

Blood Diamond is one of those movies and if you don't want to think about that, its a great action drama with great actors.  If you care though, the story told underneath is of a staggering scope.

648703,4,6303365752,"""Blood Diamond"" is the kind of action film that makes you think that 'a moment of love, even in a bad man, can give meaning to a life...'

The film opens in Sierra Leone, 1999 when Civil war rages for control of the diamond fields...According to devastating reports, these stones are being used with both rebels and government forces to purchase more weapons and finance civil war...

Danny Archer--crazy for diamonds like everybody else--believes this pink gem holds his ticket out of this godforsaken continent... He is a smuggler, a former mercenary and weapons trader from Zimbabwe who bribes all, and supplies arms to both sides... He gets Solomon Vandy--captured by government troops--out of jail only because he overhears that the fisherman might have found a clear massive stone about the size of a bird's egg...

Vandy--forced apart from his family and sent off to work as a slave in the minefields--has hided the enormous 100 carat diamond from his captors and buried it in a secret place within the jungle... His son Dia is taking away by a brainwashing militia called the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) turning him with lies, drugs, and liquor, into a cold-blooded murderer...

Danny makes a deal to help the noble fisherman find his family if Vandy will lead him to the diamond... The majority of the story is their journey across the war torn country...

Leonard DiCaprio is both ruthless and charming as the cynical soldier of fortune who knows an opportunity when it presents itself... But he also is aggressive and selfish willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants... He illustrates the black side of the dirty diamond trade... On his trek to find the stone, Archer's eyes are opened to some enduring values that surpass his own self-profit...

Djimon Hounsou eventually realizes that Danny's connections and money are his only hope... He plays a helpless character totally passionate as the resolving and fiercely determined father desperate to learn the fate of his family...

Connelly is an idealist who wishes to display corruption... She thinks that with Archer's help she can get a unique story line surrounding the civil war but also revealing corporate malfeasance and cover-up behind the diamond trade...

It is also good to mention Arnold Vosloo in the role of Colonel Coetzee, head of the army unit also trying to claim the diamond... He's a great character actor and remains a powerful presence and one of the screen's most efficient scene-stealer...

648857,5,6303365752,"""In America, it's bling bling.  But out here, it's bling bang.""

So says diamond hound Danny Archer, summing up in two sentences the vastly differing attitudes between American capitalism and third-world uprising in director Edward Zwick's (The Last Samurai) five-time Academy Award-nominated composition on greed, anarchy and its resulting desolation.  ""Blood Diamond"" is a violently epic film, one that takes a cold hard look at the diamond trade and unveils the heinous business that is behind the acquisition of these dazzling coveted stones.

Solomon Vandy (Hounsou) is a humble fisherman of the Mende tribe in Sierra Leone who has high hopes for his son Dia to become a doctor.  When his home village of Shenge is pillaged by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), he is taken prisoner and forced to work in the diamond fields to fund the radical group's arsenal.  While panning in a riverbed, Solomon unearths a rare pink diamond of grand proportion and rather than surrender it to the despicable Captain Poison (Harewood), he conceals it and later buries it in an unmarked location.

Danny Archer (DiCaprio), another in a long line of profiteers, is a covert agent for Van de Kaap Diamond Company who acquires and smuggles diamonds past Liberian officials.  When a smuggling attempt fails and Archer is subsequently arrested, Van de Kaap's bigwigs wash their hands of him.  Not wanting to blow their cover for the sake of the continual lining of their pockets, they leave Danny to fend for himself in a country ravaged by war.  While detained in a prison in Freetown, he overhears Captain Poison in another cell hiss at Solomon about the location of the stone.  Knowing that this diamond will save his hide with Col. Coetzee (Vosloo) - a mercenary responsible for the war that rages on - and provide a one-way ticket out of the country, Danny arranges for Solomon to be released and offers to find his family in exchange for information regarding the location of the stone.

Enter Maddy Bowen (Connelly), a tenacious and attractive journalist who at first utilizes her physical charisma to charm the facts out of Danny, coming off as just another correspondent hungry for a big story.  Despite being in ruthless pursuit of the facts, Maddy is a realist - she knows all too well that her presence does little to change things, her candid and emotionally harrowing articles ineffectual in the face of turmoil.  Her burning desire to expose the dirt beneath the diamond trade's pristine fingernails becomes all too clear when she reprimands Danny for capitalizing on Solomon's desperation, in turn deciding to assist Solomon in the search for his now vagrant family.

The film's screenplay from Charles Leavitt (K-PAX) is smart, cynical and emotionally earnest and bases much of its scripted chaos on factual events that Leavitt heavily researched.  Wanting to portray the conflict diamond industry as truthfully as possible, Leavitt was well aware that some of what he shared would greatly offend companies in that industry and possibly instigate nasty lawsuits, namely from De Beers (who does a majority of their mining in South Africa as well as Botswana, Namibia and Canada).

Hounsou (nominated for Best Supporting Actor) is exceptional as Solomon Vandy, a man who wants nothing more than to provide well for his family.  The desperation to find them and the burning rage against those who ravaged their once happy life are translated beautifully through Hounsou's emphatic eyes and tremulous mouth.

Connelly proves once again that she is a formidable actress as Maddy, her immense green eyes emoting much of the conviction in her dialogue.

DiCaprio (nominated for Best Actor) deftly executes a South African accent as well as some indisputably supreme acting skills.  As Danny, he portrays a man who has known nothing but violence since his childhood and as a result loosely carries his conscience in his pocket.  His self-imposed teaming with Solomon proves to be the morality check he needs, the ruthless pursuit of the diamond forcing him to look directly into the face of a nation ravaged by disorder and demoralization, something which he has turned the other cheek to so many times in the past.

In the film's closing scenes, Leavitt's screenplay states that despite the signing of the Kimberley Process (a process introduced by United Nations resolution 55/56 that is designed to certify the origin of rough diamonds from sources which are free of conflict) in 2003 that ""illegal diamonds are still finding their way to market"" and that ""it is up to the consumer to insist that a diamond is conflict-free"".  For any women that may view the film and that read this particular caption, it will have them eyeing some of their more prized pieces of jewelry with a newfound - albeit morbid - curiosity.

Bottom line: ""Blood Diamond"" is an eye-opening examination of a dirty business of which few are aware and it is clear from the outcome that it will take more than a simple governmental resolution to stop the murder and sabotage that a small, flashy piece of carbon has managed to create.",1228089600,,5105,4.991745283018868

648862,4,6303365752,"'Blood Diamond' is a very Hollywood film but at the same time it stays very true to the facts. Zwick does not overload the viewer with its 'Hollywoodness'. There are bombs exploding and lots of shooting and killing but it's not overdone like in other flicks. The enigmatic African landscape is stunningly captured (even though it wasn't specifically filmed in Sierra Leone) and the score is both mesmerizing and haunting. The cinematography is superb as it gives the film a slick feel and also gives the landscape a role of its own.

Though the story is somewhat predictable it does not effect the film in a negative way. Zwick refrains from using clichs like putting a sex scene (which would have only deviated from the main plot line) or a conventional happy ending. The slick execution makes 'Blood Diamond' entertaining, gripping and moving. It moves at a steady pace. Rosenblum's editing is good and Leavitt's screenplay is solid and engaging. The characters are well written and the insanity of the blood thirsty rebels is well depicted in a few scenes and the sequence where they brainwash the children turning them into immediate murderers, is chilling. While many seem to disagree, I thought the problem of conflict diamond is effectively presented in this movie.

I never thought Leonardo Dicaprio would ever reach the heights he did with his acting in 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' (which I considered his best work). He's been good in many films (like 'Catch Me If You Can') and bad in some (like 'Titanic', 'The Man In The Iron Mask' but I can say that his performance in both 'Gilbert Grape' and 'Blood Diamond' are his career best (though I have yet to see 'The Aviator'). In my opinion, they surpass the overrated 'The Departed'. I've always liked Djimon Hounsou's acting (especially in films like 'Amistad' and 'In America') and here he does not disappoint one bit. The actor skillfully underplays his part and is only explosive when required. The scenes between him and Dicaprio are a treat to watch. Then there's the radiant Jennifer Connelly, another actor who's performances never let down. She has a comparatively smaller role but makes the best of it. All three actors form an interesting and entertaining trio. The supporting cast do well.

While the 'Hollywoodness' gives it an entertaining quality, I think it takes away some of the rawness and that slightly hinders the film from being more hard-hitting (like 'Hotel Rwanda'). But it is pretty much an either - or situation and I still think the issues are presented well enough to balance the effectiveness of the real problem and entertainment.

Overall, Zwick's 'Blood Diamond' is an excellent gripping drama thriller that showcases the talents of actors Hounsou and Dicaprio, writer Leavitt, music director Newton Howard and director of photography Serra.",1223596800,,2836,5.002118644067797
648863,4,6303365752,"While this film was criticized for being overly-melodramatic, it remains an accurate portrait of the many issues surrounding the diamond trade in Africa.  The Kimberley Process may have sharply reduced the number of illicit stones reaching some markets, but people like the rebels, smugglers, and traders pictured in this movie have no trouble whatsoever turning their ill-gotten stones into cash even today.  The blood diamond trade flourishes in not only Sierra Leone but in Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo as well--and operates much like the Revolutionary United Front ran it's diamond mine in the film.

Leonardo DiCaprio's fine performance and Djimon Hounsou's breakthrough role as the fisherman forced into slavery in the mine make the film worth seeing even without the message-laden plot.  Kagiso Kuypers also did a great turn on the screen as Hounsou's son, Dia, who is kidnapped by the RUF at the beginning of the film.

648865,5,6303365752,"Others have stated it, great movie.  Is there some America bashing, maybe a little.  But what all these people reviewing harp on is a scene in a bar with Danny and Maddy first meeting.  She kind of attacks him for his role in this and he comes back at her with an analogy of how they are in the same business, only she is American so he tells it in relation to her nationality.  Thats pretty much it and that when they first meet a TV is on with the whole Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky fiasco going on.

Now, is that America bashing?  Its all in context to what is going on in the story.  Especially the Clinton part.  Thats pretty much there to show 2 things:

1) When this whole RUF, Sierra Leon conflict was going on.  Most people know little about it, let alone when it happened.  This just puts in our minds when this is going on and most people remember roughly where they were in there lives at that time.
2) It also is there to show the viewers at how certain things get more attention than others.  The line was something like this ""The world is falling apart and all people care about is BJ's""  Now that was coming from an American journalist in Africa reporting on Blood Diamonds, who knows more of what is going on in the world than most people.  And she wasn't watching this in America, they were watching this in West Africa, so its not like we Americans were the only ones to focus on that.

That all goes down in about 2 minutes, so I am not sure why everyone takes offense to it.  As for the stats they give I don't know if they are accurate, there are diamonds and then there are industrial diamonds, I think they are referring to consumer diamonds.  And if you want to more on this do a little research on the subject.  You will find it was pretty ugly, the diamond business in general is pretty ugly, and in fact diamonds are really not all that rare.  Do some research on DeBeers and see what you find.  I watched a documentary on this conflict before seeing this movie, and I thought it was pretty true to the conflict.

Just my thoughts.",1217980800,,2059,4.255154639175258
648960,5,6303365752,"No doubt diamonds have been smuggled out of Africa at a deadly cost.  No doubt many African nations have been torn asunder by civil war.  No doubt there have been horrendous atrocities.  And no doubt preteen boys have been literally snatched from the arms of their parents and turned into ruthless killers.  But when a movie, BLOOD DIAMOND, depicts all of the above in such a brutal, graphic nature, the question is begged:  Is it really that bad over there. . .or, perhaps, has there been a little embellishment?

But I digress.  Whether the quest for a 'Mother Lode' diamond in war-torn Sierra Leone is slightly exaggerated in terms of its gratuitous, mind-numbing violence, the fact remains this movie is pause-everything-else-in-your-life riveting.  When a filmmaker has completely and unequivocally drawn in his viewer--makes the viewer forget about everything else other than what he/she is watching on the screen--then cinema magic has been captured in a can.  So kudos to the always-innovative Edward Zwick:  His astonishing, gasping scenes had me flinching and weaving and jumping so much the springs in my recliner are creaking.  By the time the credits were rolling I felt mentally and physically drained--and grandly entertained.

As the lead (a former mercenary turned diamond smuggler with a heart of gold), Leonardo DiCaprio continues to surprise.  For the longest time he was an annoying scarecrow; now he's morphing into an accomplished thespian right before our eyes.  I really enjoyed his Rhodesian accent (or whatever they're calling Rhodesia these days).  And has Djimon Hounsou ever been lousy in a movie?  Absolutely not, and his portrayal of a fisherman trying to find and salvage his family is certainly no exception.  Jennifer Connelly looks good--even after a couple of nights in the jungle.  The on-screen tension between herself and Leo is fun to watch.  In fact, BLOOD DIAMOND, even if all the chaos and blood lust is a tad over the top, is fun to watch.

648961,4,6303365752,"This film is part-story and part-sermon, and the sermon is better than the story. Some parts are exclusively sermon such as the screen messages at the beginning and the end or the moralistic pontifications of the committee that deliberates on the diamond trade. In terms of length, most of the film consists of the story of a young soldier of fortune turned diamond smuggler, but the basic moral has been enunciated so clearly at the start that nothing in the tale of Danny Solomon and Maddy can be understood as independent of it, and that is all to the good.

Far and away the best things are the horrific sequences of civil war in Sierra Leone, and I have not yet seen a TV documentary on this topic that equals them for sheer impact. The scene where the captives' hands are lopped off spares us the ultimate in realism thank goodness, but nobody is likely to have forgotten it even two hours later when we are told that this barbarity was first introduced into Africa by King Leopold's colonial regime in the Belgian Congo. The sequences featuring the abduction and drilling of the boy revolutionaries have a chilling quality to them that probably comes mainly from a sense that this is how it happened in reality, and I wonder what it was that makes the acting so good in these ghastly vignettes, on the part of the youngsters as well as of the adults. Having encountered nothing that equals this film as a visual reconstruction of the civil war in Sierra Leone my mind reverted to the brief but indelible account of the matter given by Col Tim Collins in his memoir Rules of Engagement. This is of course a factual record, and what sticks in the reader's memory is the surrealistic irrationality of it all, with the insurgents drunk or stoned. In the film the revolutionary commander is at least rational, so for all the power of the enactment it seems that we are again being spared the ultimate worst.

According to the film, the war is about the wealth from diamonds, one rider on the general theorem that wars in Africa are about the ownership of the national resources of each locality. The `blood' theme is symbolised by the pink colour of the giant diamond at the centre of the story, and also by the pale blood of the goat into whose back some smuggled diamonds have been sewn in an early incident, but of course this is only an artistic embellishment to the literal scenes of blood. An action-story is stitched on to the basic backdrop, and in some ways it is a good one. Where the film seems a bit uncertain of itself is to what extent this is a `straight' action yarn and to what extent a parable.

The early episodes featuring Di Caprio and the other principals are not good at all. They are rather old-fashioned 50's-style stuff, very `acted' with stilted one-liners. Di Caprio does his best with encounters in which he sees off a crazed revolutionary and later some border guards with some dreary tough-guy posturing, seemingly able to command any situation by sheer personal presence and interminable repetitions of `huh?' Bogey might have carried it off, but not Di Caprio, and we could at least have done with some memorable phrases, of which I heard none. Things improve gradually, and although the dialogue between Leonardo and Jennifer Connelly is very average it at least makes a bit of a human being, as opposed to a B-movie stiff, out of Danny. The sermon element actually helps, with both of them recounting the grisly experiences of their parents in their respective previous conflicts. The actor who brings the story aspect of the film to life is neither of these but Djimon Hounsou as Solomon, and progressively Di Caprio seems to catch acting off him. In the end I carried away the feeling that Di Caprio represented the story element and Hounsou the `moral' element, the paradox of this being that Hounsou was far more dramatic and convincing. Indeed, in a film whose strength lies basically in its documentary and realistic dimension, the most devastating shot, for me, was of Solomon's bestial roar of rage as he deals out death with his shovel.

The ending is a bit of a tear-jerker, but in fact I did not mind that since the film as a whole is a slightly uneasy mixture of different elements - it might as well end this way as any other way. Danny's fate left my eyes dry, Solomon ends up as the hero and rightly so. It all comes back to the diamond trade and the human beings (for want of a better expression) who operate it. One touch that I welcomed near the end was the brief cameo part for Michael Sheen doing his Tony Blair voice as a diamond dealer, and I wonder which film came first, this one or The Queen. The world of the diamond merchants does not interact much with the hell that their trade creates in Africa. Sierra Leone was at `peace' the last I heard, but we know better by now than to rely on that for long. There are currently storms on the world financial scene, and when those occur the best place to find stability is in, say, gold, or, indeed, diamonds.",1216857600,,5016,4.563817980022198

What I didn't like was how they seemed to blame the west for much of the strife in Africa.  We buy the diamonds.  We arm them (never mind the AK's).  Etc.  Yet at some point, don't they have to take responsibility for their future?",1215043200,,478,4.175824175824176
648965,5,6303365752,"I may be alone here, but this is really one of the best films of 2006. Loads of action, bits of melodrama, and amazing performances from Djimon Hounsou as Solomon Vandy and especially Leonardo DiCaprio as smuggler Danny Archer. This is the kind of role DiCaprio needed to prove his talent.

As usual with Zwick films, there just isn't enough time for him to tell the tale he is supposed to tell. The film would be better if only a little longer. Instead, much of the intended plot is drowned out by the action (which is still impressive). And, in order to give the impression of how Africans were victimized, the screenwriters chose to make Solomon and his family the victims of nearly everything that befalls many African citizens: slavery, child abduction, exile. The movie does get a little preachy, but not so much that it overwhelms the viewer.

In spite of its faults, Blood Diamond is powerful and unforgettable, a movie to watch again and again for its pulse-pounding action, unbelievably talented performances, and important look at a more recent dark part of African history.",1214784000,,1085,4.827956989247312
648966,4,6303365752,"To start off let me go ahead and say that Blood Diamond is a excellent film and a must-see.  The setting is 1999 Sierra Leone, at that time ravaged by civil war.  Danny Archer (Dicaprio), a ex-mercenary turned diamond smuggler joins forces with Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) to recover a rare pink diamond, and to rescue Vandy's son, who has been forced into being a child soldier under rebels.  This was all around a great movie, the best of 2006 if you ask me.  Its stellar cast also includes Jennifer Connelly as a journilist that tags on part of the way.  The movie is overall very powerful, well casted, directed, written, and filmed.  Be warned that it is not an action movie that is made to entertain, it was made to make a point, and it has a good message.  My only gripe is that the end is so predictable and unoriginal that it takes something away.  I felt that the bland ending did not fit the rest of the film.  Bottom line is if you liked ""Hotel Rwanda"" than you will like this.

The only flaw I can see in this is the beautiful Jennifer Connelly--she has no chemistry with DiCaprio and the film could have been better without her character.

649087,3,6303365752,"Blood Diamond is a terrific bit of genre entertainment from Edward Zwick, the director of Glory, The Siege, and the somewhat laughable Tom Cruise vehicle The Last Samurai. However, if you are looking for a serious treatment of controversial subject matter--illegal slave labor diamond mining in South Africa--this may not be the movie for you. Blood Diamond isn't so much a political drama with action sequences (even if Zwick believes that's what he's making) as an action thriller with a convenient political backdrop to lend it some urgency and gravitas. It's a movie, after all, and if Syriana is anything to go by--which was so utterly incomprehensible critics had no choice but to praise it--then politics and cinema simply don't mix. Blood Diamond is considerably more poignant and moving than your average action thriller, however, and this is mostly due to Leonardo DeCaprio giving his first grown-up performance, as the embittered, hardened, and resourceful diamond smuggler Danny Archer.

In his earliest roles--the young retard in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Robert DeNiro's battered son in This Boy's Life, The Basketball Diaries, The Quick and the Dead, and as the young Rimbaud in Total Eclipse--DeCaprio was shaping up to be one of the most exciting actors since the young Robert DeNiro. But then something went wrong. He became a megastar with Titanic and got all buffed up for The Beach, and with his thick neck and his small round head, his Dr. Spock eyebrows and pallid skin, he began to look like he'd got stuck somewhere between adolescence and adulthood. As a result, he seemed miscast in the adult roles he was given (most of all as Howard Hughes), as if the qualities that made him such a mesmerizing actor as an adolescent made him almost uncastable as an adult. In his work for Scorsese especially (Gangs of New York, The Aviator, The Departed), he seemed to lack any substance or weight as an a actor, and he was a negligible presence. (The exception was Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can, in which DeCaprio's guilelessness and elfin features--his apparent immaturity--fitted well enough with the Walter Mitty-ish role.)

For Blood Diamond, DeCaprio assumes a thick, rather endearing South African accent and gives an impressive performance of contained intensity and depth. For the first time since those early roles, he seems to be tapping the reserves of his talent. If in his last few performances he seemed to be coasting, here he has apparently come to full attention. All of a sudden his acting is full of surprises--of small, almost throwaway touches, the kind of moments that create a fully formed, deeply affecting character. With this role, DeCaprio has rediscovered his instinct for acting--so formidable in those early roles--and with it his passion. Without him, Blood Diamond would be a so-so political thriller; with him, it's something more poignant and memorable.

Jennifer Connelly doesn't fare quite so well, alas, in an underwritten part as the conscience-driven journalist. In her early scenes, Connelly is poorly directed and too heavily made up (beauty like this doesn't need make up); she appears to be overplaying to compensate for the lack of a character, and for some unfathomable reason she is practically salivating over DeCaprio. Later, she is more contained, and has some affecting moments. She does the best she can with this earnest, two-dimensional role, that of the dedicated journalist/free spirit torn between conscience and ambition.

The main role really belongs to Djimon Hounsou as the noble black man trying to find his family, and Hounsou's Solomon is a powerful presence, the heart of the film. As an actor, he's the ideal complementary presence for DeCaprio's edgy, ruthless egotism, and together they make the most unlikely (and touching) of friendships. This is all familiar stuff, of course, and besides the performances and the political back story, there's nothing really new about Blood Diamond--just another blood thriller dressed up as a tale of government corruption and personal redemption. But it's an exemplary model--a muscular action movie with heart (if not brains) as well as brawn.",1204588800,,4171,5.156573116691285

Despite his Zimbabwean birth, Danny's accent is that of an English speaking Johannesburger, and his attitude and demeanor throughout the movie are decidedly South African. He's like a thousand other guys in the South African army and for this authentic portrayal alone he deserves an Oscar.

The movie itself is interesting enough and portrayals of the violence are about as accurate as can be, but the story is a little contrived in places. The attempts at a romantic involvement thrown in are a little off-balance with the movie, but it's generally a good watch.

1. While DeCaprio is good in his part, he does struggle with the Rhodesian accent. Aren't there a lot of real Rhodesians who would just nail that accent?
2. The 3 main characters are a diamond smuggler, a simple fisherman, and a young journalist. Yet they make more miraculous escapes than Superman, Rambo and Wonder Woman here.
3. The overall ""Let's Blame America"" tone of the movie. The movie cites America as the dominant consumer of these diamonds- HOGWASH. The fact is that the EU, the Midle East, and Asia are all major consumers of diamonds today. Gone are the days when the US was the dominant consumer of anything, except maybe lies that single them out for the blame. Even in 1999, when the movie was set, it would have been much more truthful to say that the US was one of many major users of diamonds.

649202,5,6303365752,"With recent outstanding performances in the Aviator, The Departed and in this movie DiCaprio is becoming a powerhouse on the big screen. Here he is fantastic and believable as Danny Archer, a mercenary from Zimbabwe. His true accent and mannerisms suggest he studied well for this part. Even in his use of inconsequential dialog he gets it right- for instance responding 'ya' instead of the more typical 'yeah.'

Archer is no saint here. He smuggles diamonds out of war torn Sierra Leone for a living. After getting arrested he runs into Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou)and learns that Vandy has a gigantic diamond hidden away somewhere. Amidst all the violence and turmoil in Sierra Leone they form an uneasy partnership. Vandy wants to get his kidnapped son back and Archer needs to make good to his criminal partners for the diamonds he has lost. Archer wants to broker the sale of this magnificent diamond, split the profit with Vandy. Along the way they run into Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) a crusading reporter who is troubled because her western readers do not seem to care about the plight of war torn Sierra Leone and it's many innocent victims who are caught up in the violence. In one of the many memorable scenes she forcefully expresses her frustration that her heartfelt stories and photos of suffering families will not be enough to make headlines outside of Africa. Americans are unaware(or unconcerned) that Africans are being killed in grave numbers. Instead Americans are transfixed by the inconsequential political events of the day such as the Presidents adulterous activities.

To make headlines Maddy Bowen wants some inside information about the diamond smuggling. That is the beauty of this symbiotic relationship between the 3 main characters, they need each other but for vastly different reasons. All three main characters move through a beautiful countryside marred by violence. Out here they often run into violent child soldiers. Vandy, an honest and hard working fisherman knows his son has been caught up in this. He will do anything to get his son back. In another memorable scene (and I won't give away specifics)Vandy finally encounters the person who is abducting children, giving them drugs and forcing them to become child soldiers.

649207,5,6303365752,"This is one of the best political films I've ever seen. It has intensely-thrilling action, wonderful acting, and stunning political implications. I saw it and I was gripped for the entire 143 minutes.

This film is based upon the chaotic political and economic struggles in west Africa in the late 1990s. The movie begins with Leonardo DiCaprio as a diamond smuggler from South Africa, working in Liberia and Sierra Leone. A few minutes into the film, he crosses the path of a man names Solomon (played by Djimon Hounsou) who has had his life destroyed by the Sierra Leone civil war. The twist here, is that the rebels receive their guns by trading diamonds with the more powerful countries that thoughtlessly fuel the African diamond trade. DiCaprio is a cynic who tends to blame everyone; he is thus unsympathetic to Solomon's attempts to find his family. Soon, a third major character, an American journalist played by Jennifer Connelly, enters into the fray. She is determined to document the diamond trade and unravel the tragedies of humanity within western Africa. What makes this film so interesting is the connection between DiCaprio, Hounsou, and Connelly even though they are all fighting for different and opposite goals.

Through beautifully-shot cinematography, mind-blowing intensity, and remarkable political relevance, BLOOD DIAMOND is one of the most gripping films of the year. It really does deserve all of its Academy Award nominations. Watch it and you will be absolutely gripped, forced to rethink your philosophies about world connections and the masked corruption that exists in economic policy today.",1198281600,,1626,5.226053639846743
649208,5,6303365752,"Whatever one may have thought about Leonardo DiCaprio prior to this film, it must be revised after seeing it.  If you liked his work before, this performance will elevate him further in your esteem.  If you had doubts about his abilities - as this reviewer did - ""Blood Diamond"" will dispel them.  The story of a civil war in the manufactured African nation of Sierra Leone, the film is nearly an art form of modern power struggles.  Violence is endemic, with meaningless killings, abduction of children to become soldiers and the waning light of justice in a world of social disruption.

DiCaprio, in the character of Danny Archer, for all the strength of his depiction as a  trader, remains a middle level figure in the sweeping picture of the diamond trade.  Rebel armies have become mining managers as well as guerrilla fighters.  Villages are raided for workers and soldiers, leading to fisherman Solomon Vandy [Djimon Housou] being taken for the one and his son Dia for the other.  It's hard to know which scenes are more wrenching, the harsh discipline of the mining or the terror conditioning of the boy soldiers.  Solomon is revealed as having found a priceless diamond while he and Archer happen to be in the same gaol.  Archer sees an opportunity and takes up with Solomon, who is seeking his lost son.

The interaction between the two men, with its added fillip of the white's dependency on the African, is almost serpentine.  We never really learn if Solomon expects to trade the diamond for his son, or use it to reunite and enrich his entire family.  Archer, under the tutelage of a mercenary colonel [with which Africa seems surfeited], must maintain a precarious balance.  That delicate role is complicated further when he meets a journalist with a sense of mission.  Watching this film the second time with Zwick's commentary on how Jennifer Connelly built the role of Maddy Bowen from accounts of women journalists in war zones is more than just informative.  It gives vivid credence to the wonderful scene where Bowen ""disarms"" a group of threatening rebels with her camera.

To reach that point, Zwick and his production team have produced a stunning array of images.  From the grandeur of African landscapes in Mozambique, South Africa, Sierra Leone to the intimate close-ups of both major and minor characters, this film is exemplary cinematic drama.  Zwick's description of what had to be done to keep the film's impact strong without harm coming to the participants is enlightening.  That Housou and DiCaprio insisted on doing many action shots on their own instead of using stuntmen must have aged the director measureably.  What some of the battle scenes might have done to the extras, who were acting novices, is beyond description.  Zwick's selection of a 12-year-old music and drama student to play the child soldier is indicative.

The denouement of this film is very nearly ""Hollywood pap"", but not quite.  The fate of Solomon and Dia, of Danny Archer, but mostly that of the diamond, are suffused with ironies.  While Zwick may not deserve credit for instigating changes in the diamond industry, the efforts of people such as Connelly portrayed most certainly do.  It's encouraging that a film such as this could come out of Hollywood instead of a European studio.  Hollywood may be shedding its fear of reality.  One can only hope that audiences can cope with it as well.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]",1197244800,,3443,4.896373056994818
649321,5,6303365752,"Blood Diamond was not a movie high on my list.  I originally thought it was an action movie with Leonardo DiCaprio.  Although it is much more than that.  The story takes us to war strewn country of Sierra Leone where the government is trying to fend off the rebels.  Watching the movie made me realize there is really no good side.

The movie takes place in the late 90's when people in the United States were more concerned about the Bill Clinton Monica Lewinsky scandal.  There were very real problems going on in the world and that is apparent in this story.  The movie makes no excuses for the excessive violence since it was and is such a real issue in the world.  Diamond smuggling is a multi billion dollar business fed on the Western desire for the precious jewels.

The story develops quickly with an average family living in a small village.  Their life was generally peaceful in an exploding world.  The rebels then attack the village taking no prisoners.  The battle becomes very real when you see small children with machine guns shooting at everyone.  When the dust settles the Solomon's family has escaped and he has been trapped.  Solomon is then quickly shuttled off to a diamond field to begin work searching for diamonds.  During this work Solomon comes across a diamond as large as an egg.  Surprised by this find he realizes the only thing he can do is take the diamond and hide it.

What happens then is an amazing story filled with action and suspense.  A journey that never stops and can only takes one breath away when they realize this is something that really happened.  It is a sad story but it is also a happy story.

I watched the Blu-ray version which was filled with a beautiful picture and wonderful sound.  It also had many extra features including a wonderful documentary about the smuggling business.  For anyone with a Blu-ray player I highly recommend this movie.

This is easily one of the best movies of the year.  With the lack of great movies this year it's great to have a diamond in the rough.  A story that is incredibly amazing and true.  Sometimes almost hard to believe this could be real.  This is a journey of how greed can lead to terrible things.  I hope if you take the time to watch this you learn something about wrongs that have occurred because of greed.  A definite must watch for anyone.",1197072000,,2346,4.545454545454546

I realize her character was supposed to come across a bit detached, but it translated more as a lack of chemistry between her DiCaprio, and even Hounsou.  I tend to think that when you are dealing with such charged subject matter that the acting doesn't have to compensate on any level, but this character/role is an example of how that is not true.  I failed to see her character's humanity, while in the other two characters, Archer and Vandy, I got very emotionally and psychologically caught up in them.  The premise of the story is volatile from the beginning, and the plot supports that momentum all the way through.  The film raises many questions about the world's involvement with and repulsion of Africa, no stone unturned.

649330,5,6303365752,"Leonardo DiCaprio's threat is among one of the more genteel moments in BLOOD DIAMOND, a ruthlessly realistic, almost documentary-like film exposing the horrifying world of conflict diamonds in the west African nation of Sierra Leone.

DiCaprio plays Danny Archer, a white Zimbabwean (or as he insists, ""Rhodesian"") diamond smuggler and soldier of fortune who is seeking a 100 carat rose colored raw diamond discovered by an enslaved diamond digger. Strictly for the selfish reason of finding the stone, Archer helps the man, Solomon Vandy, to escape, and together, they seek Vandy's scattered family and the diamond even while being hunted by all three sides in Sierra Leone's hideous civil war, the Sierra Leone government, the rebels, and troops of white mercenaries who veer between roles as protectors, liberators and pirates with evil ease.

Archer and Vandy's odyssey is marked by all the nightmares of the conflict: rape squads, child soldiers, slavery, random pointless slaughter and destruction, and mayhem mutilation as punishment. The unfortunate victims had hands, feet, limbs, their tongues or their eyes removed for any reason at all or no reason at the whim of whatever group was choosing to victimize them.

Jennifer Connelly plays an American journalist reporting on the stories of this largely unknown killing field. The beautiful Connelly plays her role convincingly, but she's an insufficient distraction against a backdrop in which almost no one seems to have a higher motive than their own greed, their own survival, or their own aggrandizement.

BLOOD DIAMOND is masterfully made and presented, but it suffers from an overly formulaic approach, constantly reminding the viewer that the conflict diamond genocide is an important issue. This is a ""message"" movie, and while it IS an important message, the viewer is left both ultimately troubled and impotent. Yes, this is a horror . . . but it seems there's nothing we can do.

As Connelly says at one moment: ""Why would I risk my story just to help a single person . . . ? I can't believe I said that."" Sadly enough for our own humanity, that is the moral of BLOOD DIAMOND in a sentence or less.",1193529600,,2168,5.061624649859944

How is it that women MUST have a diamond to be wed?

Do some research and find yet another tale of the first world keeping the third world enslaved in the name of petty egotism.

This film does the service of pointing out that for every happy bride with a diamond on her finger, there is a dead child in the bush somewhere whose parents were tortured and then killed so that someone's Vegas wedding could impress the other rubes.

It is a story of greed, fatherly love and love in all the wrong places.

DiCaprio, Connelly, and Hounsou were all excellent in their roles, but it is definitely DiCaprio as the Rhodesian exile that makes this film compelling.  Also, the outrageous chase scenes that many movie-goers are so tired of are well done and more palatable in an African setting where gunfights are a believable occurance.

There remains an underlying message condemning the world's diamond trade.  It's a political statement that has some merit, but is overblown (as it was in the book) in identifying its true culprits.

649506,5,6303365752,"I think that this movie is the perfect blend of a documentary and an action-drama. Clearly the intent was to bring to the forefront the issue of conflict diamonds in Africa. But instead of going for a factual film, the creators decided to throw together a group of great actors and a set of interesting sidelines to the story, polishing it into a magnificent jewel. The issue at hand is the brutal slaughtering in several parts of Africa, especially Sierra Leone, related to the control of diamonds. The situation in the movie is best described as TIA (This is Africa), a political mess, where those that govern only want to steal for their own benefit, and where there is no way to help, not even for the peace corps.

Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is a fisherman that dreams of his son, Dia, becoming a doctor and moving on to better things. This dream is stopped in its track when the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) comes to his village and brutally slaughters most of the inhabitants. Luckily, Solomon's family escapes, but the RUF captures him and takes him to work on the diamond fields as a slave. Meanwhile, politicians in the industrialized world are aware of the problem resulting from diamonds from conflict zones and there is an agreement not to buy them anymore. The big diamond houses in Europe and the US agree, but you probably know by now that they will go around it in one way or another.

Then there is Danny (Leonardo DiCaprio), who is a local from Zimbabwe that gives arms to different guerrilla groups in exchange for diamonds and then smuggles them to Liberia, from where they can be imported into the consumer countries as conflict free rocks. When he is captured during one of his diamond operations, he is thrown in jail, where he meets Solomon. Solomon was in jail as a result of a raid of the RUF camp, but not before finding a big pink diamond that he hid underground. When the greedy Danny finds out about this, he makes sure that his future path is linked to Solomon's.

Besides the greedy and unscrupulous Danny, and the moral Solomon, who just wants his family back, we have Maddy (Jennifer Connelly), a journalist that is frustrated by the situations she witnesses all around the globe and that wants her work to be effective in stopping the destruction. The three characters go through a journey of self-discovery while everyone around them is out to kill each other for the control of the diamonds. The situation is so bad that the different revolutionary groups kidnap and train children to join them. Seeing the transformation these young minds go through in a short time breaks your heart.

The film definitely achieves its purpose of making people aware of the issues, and even though the story is gut-wrenching and some portions are extremely violent, I think that it was needed to convey the message clearly. What I did not expect before watching this movie was the outstanding performances I was going to witness. This is definitely DiCaprio's best. He even altered his accent to make it sound like a local and he does this very well. But he also has to play a character with multiple facets and that goes through somewhat of a transformation, and his performance really helps to make this believable. I have never heard of Hounsou before, but was impressed by the emotion he put into his role, and I am sure there will be many starring roles for him in the future. Jennifer Connely is the one I expected the best from, and she did not disappoint, since she delivers a performance on par to the one she gave us on excellent ""The House of Sand and Fog"".

Leonardo DiCaprio is brilliant as a Rhodesian mercenary caught up in the diamond trade that kept the rebels armed and fighting, with the connivance of the international diamond industry. The film depicts how the rebels kidnapped boys and brainwashed them into soldiers willing to slaughter innocents. What it doesn't show is how girls were also taken, to serve as sex slaves and help bind the boys to their enslavers.

The guerrillas and terrorists of today have obviously not read Che or Regis Debray. The film shows how they could just drive into a village, killing everyone in sight, except those who they kidnapped as slaves and canon fodder. Che wrote that the purpose of guerrilla warfare is to win the hearts of the population. This isn't done by widescale slaughter, and is probably one reason why the rebels in Sierra Leone and Liberia lost their wars.",1188518400,,1101,4.882352941176471

649591,4,6303365752,"... said of the diamond-industry. And, true enough.

While Zwick's film ""suffers"" from a similar ""problem"" as Terry George's ""Hotel Rwanda"" (a critical ""story"" told primarily through thoroughly Westernized characters), much like George's work this tactic helps garner the attention of the Western world (and, thus, the ""problem"" is entirely forgivable).

While conflict-diamonds have been the subject of countless journalistic-accounts and documentaries, too few Americans seemed to have noticed (BBC News and The History Channel do not seem to be priority-television for many). (And, like many of you, I was incredulous at the posts here which registered surprise that the film has a ""message"" ... one is forced to wonder, did these people even know of atrocities in Sierra Leone?! Or were they just buying a DiCaprio film?!) Zwick has done an immense service to the world by creating this work ... and DiCaprio and Hounsou for lending their names and talent.

Kudos to script-writer Leaviitt for fearlessly tackling the ""dirty"" side of the diamond-industry. He painted them for the ghouls they really are (The De Beers corporation will happily tell you that they do not buy conflict-diamonds ... what they don't tell you is they have NO real way of knowing ... not even with the Kimberly Process in effect). And though the film concludes with a message to the viewer about demanding conflict-free diamonds, numerous investigations have determined that this process is NOT failsafe and that NO ONE should ever feel confident buying a diamond).

In Zwick's work, Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) declares that if the Western world understood the horror behind these diamonds, they wouldn't purchase them. I had to pause ... really? Since when do we Westerners (especially Americans) care about the cost of privilege? We continue to support some the most repugnant corporations on this planet. We still buy Nike (guilty of child-labor). We still buy Champion (guilty of child-labor). We still buy Coca-Cola (guilty of directly sponsoring Columbian death-squads). We still buy Nestle (guilty of the deaths of countless African children as a result of the formula scandal). And we still support Citibank (notorious for its environmental destruction). Can this film change minds? Maybe (Hopefully!) Will it just be consumed, discussed over beers at Bennigans, and forgotten? Probably.

So what was the ultimate result of Zwick's courageous endeavor? Those in the Western world who have seen this work cannot possibly purchase a diamond without a pang of guilt ... and, for that alone, this film is an epic success. (Even though, I know, Westerners have an uncanny talent for selective-amnesia). Will they still buy diamond rings (and other equally indulgent rubbish)? Probably. But, now when they gaze at those glittering baubles on their hands, maybe ... just maybe ... they will consider those who do not have hands as a result. (Or maybe that's just wishful thinking?)

Suggested viewing: The History Channel's ""Blood Diamonds."" (An in-depth account of the politics and atrocities of the diamond-industry). (Just do a ""TV Guide"" search for its next airing!)",1187827200,,3155,5.287425149700598

649697,5,6303365752,"When you think about movies today, it's easy to get lost in the sequels, the remakes, the adaptations, and every other unoriginal and derivative source for brains-off entertainment Hollywood can muster. Part of this problem, sometimes, is the ""true story"", another easy way through a script (plotting, who needs to do THAT?) ... but, occasionally, there are stories that really, really have to be told. When that happens, an easy trap film makers fall into is to let the message carry away the movie, leaving the viewer awash in actor sermons and all other kinds of pretentious hooplah. Rarely does a movie come along that is important and yet also works as a movie. Blood Diamond is just such a rare gem.

The characters are archetypes. Their names don't even matter ... They represent the three essential plot elements: a South African white diamond smuggler; an idealistic American journalist, female (played by the inimitable Jennifer Connally); and the African father desperate to save his son--and, by extension, the generation--from losing his soul to murder.

Everything is well done in this movie. And if it's brutal to watch, well, it should be.

Zwick does go on and on in great detail, through practically every scene of the movie, talking about both the historical context and the 'art' of cinematography.

Not surprisingly, the movie intends to convey the unsubtle message of 'war is hell.' Nevertheless, the extra gave excellent background to di Caprio's accent and some asides that were very interesting but were not explored in the movie itself, such as why the Danny character lapsed into a kind of pidgen when talking with a tribal chief. At one point, The character Danny greets a male acquaintance with ""How are you, China?"" That character's name was not ""China."" My Australian husband explained that was Cockney rhyming slang for ""china plate"" rhyming with 'mate.'

649702,5,6303365752,"This movie had it all.  It was an incredibly well written screenplay, amazing cinematography, great performances, awesome special effects and a powerful message.

As a story about the ""blood trade"" of diamonds, this movie does a great job of bringing this issue to life for Westerners.  For many years, the West was content to ignore the reality of the diamond trade -- the circumstances of war torn Africa, the flow of Western money, enslavement of children barely out of single digits in age.  Fortunately this issue has gained worldwide attention and sparked both individual and government response in an attempt to stem the tide of this situation.  Hopefully individuals will see beyond the diamond issue this movie focuses on and familiarize themselves with other global situations similar to the the diamond trade that enable the consumerism of the West.

Even if one is not concerned by the moral, social and political issues that this movie raises, it is equally powerful as a taut action thriller.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou give performances that were well worthy of the Oscar nominations that they received.  The cinematography was some of the best that I have seen.

649760,5,6303365752,"Greed is the dark heart of ""Blood Diamond,"" director Edward Zwick's (""The Last Samurai"") uncompromising look into the underground trafficking of illegally-traded gems in sub-Saharan Africa.  Greed of corrupt men for power, greed of an amoral mercenary willing to sacrifice anything for a chance to escape Africa, greed of Western businessmen who seek to artificially control the diamond market, and the greed of a simple man for his family's return.  This movie powerfully demonstrates the valuelessness of a human life to those persons obsessed with blood diamond collection in war-ravaged Sierra Leone.

Djimon Hounsou plays Solomon Vandy, a simple fisherman and father of two who witnesses his idyllic existence crumble before his eyes.  Rebels seeking new recruits, slaves, and random carnage swarm into his village.  They select his adolescent son and other young men as future cadets in their guerilla army--following suitable brainwashing and manipulation techniques--before then getting down to the real business of slave collection.  Seemingly devoid of any mental workings besides casual sadism, these bandits top-off their kidnapping and slave-taking exercise with the mutilation and execution of men deemed too troublesome for them to bother with.  Vandy is rescued from dismemberment at the last minute when the rebels recognize his strength, seeing it as an asset they can utilize in their constant search for capital:  the blood diamond pits.  Condemned to toiling underneath the blazing sun with nary a chance of reaping any benefit (besides possible continued survival) for his efforts, Vandy happens to discover an egg-sized blood diamond hidden in the streambed.  Hiding it underneath his foot, he buries it when the rebel encampment is attacked by government troops.  The only witness to his ""theft"" is the wounded slave captain--now captured, along with Vandy, by government forces--who swears that the former fisherman will soon be begging to reveal the diamond's whereabouts.

Parallel to Djimon's character's storyline is the tale of Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), an opportunistic solider of fortune caught within a dichotomy of conflicting motivation.  He desires escape from Africa at any cost, yet secretly knows that his blood will someday mix with the earth of his homeland.  Perhaps it is this realization that he is doomed which propels Archer forward:  in every action and every word, he seems to be daring destiny to obliterate him.  Taken in and trained from a young age by Colonel Coetzee (Arnold Vosloo), Archer is easily the most dangerous entity alive on the continent:  ruthless, misanthropic, callous, manipulative, and incredibly lethal with bullet and blade.  After a close-call haggling with rebel leaders over fair prices for blood diamonds, Archer is arrested for smuggling while crossing the Sierra Leone border.  It is here that he intercepts the distraught Vandy and begins weaving a plan to save himself from the war-torn country:  by dangling the freedom of the fisherman's family as bait to cajole Vandy into revealing the gigantic diamond's location.  Solomon, though a simple man, is not so easily fooled.  He eventually agrees to help Archer--but only if the mercenary agrees to help locate his family and also permit Solomon to be his travel companion.

There is barely time for indrawn breath during the watching of this movie.  Action sequences are furious, brutal, and frequent.  The pace of the movie is frenetic.  The score is perfect throughout.  The ""education"" of Vandy's son by the rebels is heart-wrenching.  Solomon's overarching belief that fatherhood trumps all initially feels nave, but is eventually revealed to be the singularly most powerful force in the entire movie.  Danny's character--the realist mercenary who seems most capable of surviving, when compared to Vandy--shows the most evolution, shedding layers of the personality onion until an actual human appears.  He is moved to reveal an element of his past to the beautiful American reporter (Jennifer Connelly), whose persistence and mutual survivorship cements a bond they both were too proud to admit from their first meeting.  Archer and Vandy relationship morphs into something beautiful when a sacrifice is needed, prompting Solomon to reverse that remarkably chauvinistic statement made by Rudyard Kipling over one hundred years ago:  the ""white man's burden.""

This is hands-down Djimon's most impressive performance:  I have never seen him better represent a character.  In fact, he blurs the line between character and actor, totally suspending my disbelief to the point where I ""knew"" him only as Vandy.  I have been told by an acquaintance--currently living in Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia)--that DiCaprio's accent is spot-on.  In addition, he was utterly believable as heartless mercenary, and his later transformation was also quite convincing.  The action sequences were, as mentioned, jaw-dropping in their intensity, but never felt gratuitous or over-the-top.

Easily one of my five favorite movies of 2006--miss it, and you risk missing some of the finest cinematographic wizardry and directorial finesse of cinema from the last year, period.",1182470400,,5194,5.461152882205514
649761,4,6303365752,"The Movie Itself received 5 Academy Award nominations, including best actor and best supporting actor. ""Blood Diamond"" was directed by Edward Zwick. The film itself is set in Sierra Leone Africa in 1999 during a civil war over ""blood diamonds."" These diamonds in the mines are found by the kidnapped boys that are forced to be made part of the rebel forces. Once found the diamonds then are smuggled out of the country and used basically to buy more weapons and just make the war even worse.

The film primarily stars Leonardo DiCaprio as ""Danny Archer"" (an ex-mercenary turned smuggler), Dijimon Honsou as ""Solomon Vandy"" (an African fisherman who's struggling against rebel forces to reunite with his family) and Jennifer Connelly as ""Maddy Bowen"" (an American journalist trying to expose the ""Blood Diamond"" ordeal going on in Africa).

The basic plot here to the film is that ""Solomon Vandy"" has been kidnapped by rebels who took his family and put his son ""Dia Vandy"" in the rebel army. ""Soloman"" is forced to work in the diamond mines and finds a huge pink diamond. After seeing that others who try to hide diamonds they find get executed by the commander of the rebel forces, ""Soloman"" still tries to hide this one in between his toes. He tells the foreman he needs to use the bathroom to try to make a smooth get away and hide the diamond but things don't go as planned. Long story short ""Soloman"" ends up in jail with ""Danny Archer"" who knows that he has hid the diamond. So ""Archer"" arranges for him to be released after he gets out himself and offers to help him get back his family in exchange for the diamond. Sounds simple enough, right?

I can now see why this film got the Academy Award nominations it that it did for best actor and best supporting actor. This is honestly a really good film.

Video Quality on this release is in VC-1 on a 50 gigabyte Dual-Layer Blu-ray Disc. The real problem here is consistency in the video quality. A majority of the time (especially the outdoors scenes) the picture is great but there are some rare occasions that (even other reviewers have noted) have some artifacts and pixilation problems. The real thing that tends to make this show is smoke in dark scenes. The black level is overall solid. Chances are by the time this film makes it's way to HD DVD I would say Warner Brothers will redo the video transfer. Considering like I said, this problem has been stated by others than just myself.

Overall though the video quality is good on this release and the rare problems in the consistency should not discourage the Blu-ray consumer from purchasing this release. If it does discourage you from purchasing this Blu-ray and you don't own a HD DVD player, you're totally going to be missing out on a really good film. If you do own a HD DVD player and are still a bit skeptic, my best advice for you is to wait until July when the film will be released on HD DVD.

Audio Quality on this release is in Uncompressed Linear PCM 5.1 @4.6Mbps as well as standard Dolby Digital 5.1. Like ""The Departed"" on Blu-ray Disc Warner Brothers decided to give this release a PCM 5.1 track. This is one of the few Warner releases on Blu-ray Disc to feature this and it's a shame because this really pays off to make for an amazing sound experience. The sounds of everything from crickets to gunfire to explosions to even the score sound absolutely awesome.

Bonus Materials on this release are in 16:9 (Widescreen) standard definition. First off is obviously an audio commentary by Director Edward Zwick. All of the bonus materials have subtitles to them here and pretty much describe what they are so I won't be going into a lot of detail unless it's noteworthy. There's ""Focus Points: Featurettes and Production Diaries (46 minutes) which is pretty much the ""making of"" to this film. ""Blood on the Stone: Follow a Diamond's Path from the Ground to the Store"" (50 minutes) is a really in-depth look at the real ""Blood Diamonds"" out there. ""Becoming Archer: Profiling Leonardo DiCaprio"" (8 minutes) is just as it says, just a profile on Leo in this film. ""Journalism on the Front Line: Jennifer Connelly on Women Journalists at War"" (5 minutes) on the other hand is less about her and more about the actual women journalists that do cover these type of events. ""Inside the Siege of Freetown: Edward Zwick on One of the Movie's Pivotal Sequences"" (10 minutes) is really interesting and worth watching. Lastly there is the music video for ""Shine on Em"" by Nas. Overall this release has some pretty decent bonus materials but I have a feeling that an ""In-Movie Experience"" on HD DVD will be a tad better.

649762,2,6303365752,"The great press touting ""Blood Diamond"" led me to expect a film with the depth of insight into the politics and social consequences of the diamond trade that I found when watching ""Hotel Rwanda.""  The latter was chilling in its realism of the international politics connected with this genocide and excellent in portrayal of its characters.

Not so with ""Blood Diamond."" For me, nothing in ""Blood Diamond"" redeems the film's failure to depthfully unmask the price paid by everyday African workers for a commodity that we so often use to symbolize the ""good life"".

It is a film heavy on bloodshed, threats to survival and brutality.  Characterizations are lightweight.  The African father, in particular, should have been portrayed with a great deal more depth. His character was so obscure and marginalized that there was no preparation for his actions at the film's end.

In short, on all counts -- I was deeply disappointed.  The best I can say of it is that there is plenty of action.",1182124800,,988,4.880239520958084

This was a really sad brutal truth about the murders that go on in South Africa because of diamonds. It's filled with violence. Although it's action packed, I thought the little romance between the reporter and the soldier seemed thrown in and it slowed the movie down and made it boring during those parts. It also makes the reporter out to be somewhat of the hero. I didn't like that either. Certain parts were just unrealistic like how the reporter seemed to always walk away with just a bruise after running from the rebels. Meanwhile the guys were all bruised and sweaty. But, in the end this was definitely educational, but very graphic. Maybe that was the point?",1182124800,,791,4.6571428571428575

From what I understand, ALL the Warner Bros high def transfers are mastered for HD-DVD first and then ported to Blu-Ray, making the technology argument completely moot.  It's mastered in HD-DVD format first because it's easier and more economical for the studio to do so.  What have we learned today?  To date (as far as I know), all WB high def titles are mastered for HD-DVD, even if it's on Blu-Ray.

I still think Leo DiCaprio should have been Oscar nominated and won for his role in The Departed.  But he did well in Blood Diamond, too. If you are fortunate enough to have both HD-DVD and BR, spread the love and pick up The Departed in HD-DVD, since it'll look identical to the BR version ;-O

It really is a shame that one has to go to the standard def DVD page to find out if people liked the movie, rather than have a typing war on why one format is superior than the other.  If the studios really were as smart as they think they are, they'd release the same titles on both formats, allowing the people to decide who wins.

Every time they discover some new 'treasure' in Africa, be it diamonds, oil, whatever, then rebels come in taking children to be 'killers', brainwashing them most decidedly, and killing thousands for the almighty dollar.
  It is definitely worthy of it's oscar nomination, and I would have voted for his supporting actor myself, as he was just that good and convincing, and it is sad and makes one 'think' about all the stupid 'bling' that people over here shoot one another for. There is so much bloodshed for these 'things' and greed is SO apparent. That is the bottom line. It was very very thought provoking, painful, and yet makes one feel like they're living in the lap of luxury even if they are sitting in a small studio like myself with just so much around me.

649866,5,6303365752,"This was the first Lenardo movie I was watching after ""The Beach"". The young lad in the movie of yesteryears was gone and I it was nice to see a great performance from Leonardo now very much into his manhood. The talented Jennifer Conolly does a great role too. The little romance that is there between Jennifer and Leonardo is lovely. Leonardo's character is also one that you'll learn to empathise and sympathise. As a white man living in a neighbouring country and being part of the illegal gem trade himself you wonder how many such lives are shattered by the political upheavals in these countries. The lines spoken by him when he narrates his story to Jennifer was moving, particularly ""....at that time I though God left this place..."" And what to say of Djmon Hnsou. These days he fits into roles like they were made for him. Nice to also see the villian of ""The Mummy"" series back in this movie.

Above all this the crime can never be forgotten. The crime is even worse. Atrocities such as rape of family members in the presence of other family members, forced incest sex in front of children etc., are all done to demoralize and destabilize child recruits and make them into remorseless hardcore fighters. Many of the soldiers are even young girls, often physically abused to the point of mental breakdown where sex is no longer a pleasure for them. Some fortunate child soldires have moved or have been rehabilitated in other countries. ""Child soldier"" written by one such female soldier now living in the Netherlands explains it all. And how all this exploitation goes on for material comforts and benefits of those who are either directly or indirectly perpetrating it is something this movie explains well.

The only annoying thing is the partying music played everytime the RUF is shown, even when they are on the rampage. This could have either been avoided or not overdone.

Lovely soundtrack to its credit with lots of Afro rythms, sounds and vocals. Reminds one of the sounds Paul Simon put into his album ""Graceland"" in the 80's. James Newton Howard's background score is beautiful too particularly in the romantic and the sentimental scenes.

Another observation and one that deserves worthy mention is the audio/sound effects of this movie and whoever was behind this deserves praise. Inspite of all the atrocities that are going on around, listen and you can still hear the birds in the trees and bushes singing and going about their lives happily and peacefully. To see unspoilt nature (now being spoilt on a large scale) as it is in Africa was also refreshing.

Everyone knows few diamonds are found in Liberia, but all choose to ignore that inconvenient fact. In the service of the trade, rebels capture their own people and make them slaves,  panning for stones in shallow streams.

But the child soldiers of Africa are the real story of this film. Boys are captured from villages by rebels and in the best totalitarian style brainwashed and ordered to commit unspeakable crimes. Those who resist receive the same punishments the European powers and American slave traders used so effectively for so long.

Blood Diamond's director Edward Zwick did another fantastic job here. We loved his The Last Samurai, with Tom Cruise. Yet another fantastic thinking man's action flick.

Blood Diamond also has the unusual unsappy love story, which is a much more realistic way to approach such things. Beautiful cinemetography, savage tribes and warlords abound here, showing the mostly unknowledgeable viewing audience of such real-life happenings in the world today. Brilliantly done.

I was not expecting something so fresh and exciting in this film. Even my wife was spellbound, expecting a typical action movie. It is anything but!

Africa is shown here in all its beauty and savagery, both in its locales and people, whether white or black. With its superlative storytelling, strong performances, excellent action sequences, and differing locales of harsh living and lush beauty, Blood Diamond delivers on many levels.

""In America it's bling bling, but out here it's bling bang,"" says Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) in this action-packed flick about Africa's corrupt diamond trade."" kevin O'Donnell

This movie took awhile to become enmeshed in the story. Much could be edited but then, maybe that is what you need in order to survive the  violence of the film.  'Blood Diamond' takes place in 1999 Sierra Leone, when the country is involved in a civil war. It is difficult at times to decide which side is the most evil; the government or the rebels. It is the innocent farmers caught in between the fighting who pay the price. Diamonds, one of the country's largest moneymakers, are being smuggled out and purchased on the open market, There is a ban on purchasing these 'blood diamonds', but merchants prevail.

Solomon Vandy, Djimon Hounsan, is a farmer. He educates his son for a better life. And then one day the rebels capture his son. Solomon is sent to sift for diamonds, and he  finds a 100-karat pink diamond. He meets a soldier of fortune, Danny Archer, Leonardo DiCaprio, who makes a deal for the diamond. Archer will help him find his wife and children for the diamond. They meet an American journalist, Maddy Brown, Jennifer Connelly, who agrees to help them if she can write about their experiences.  The violence and the bloodshed are so real and caused me to close my eyes. The boy solders who are taught to kill are so real and evil. Blood Diamond is as effective in depicting the corruption of innocent people as it is in showing the hell of war. It also highlights greed and manipulation.

""Archer. Leonardo DiCaprio, has the most complete role. Thankfully, he never loses his ""me first"" attitude, but we come to understand how it has developed and we see a gradual softening of some of his morals. It's a solid performance from Leonardo DiCaprio, who has grown into this sort of ""gritty"" role and is more believable after having been seen dancing on the dark side in The Departed. This is not the same actor who set young female hearts aflutter ten years ago. He has discovered a measure of gravitas. Solomon's passion drives the movie forward; when Blood Diamond has urgency, it's because of him. Djimon Hounsou is volcanic in this role."" James Berardinelli

This could have been the movie of the year were it not for the length and the tediousness of the first 45 minutes. The movie grabbed me for the last hour. It was rivieting and the story one that needs to be told. The message, other than the sory of civil war and the diamond trade, is that Leonardo Di Caprio has found his measure.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 6-03-07

The viewer is introduced to these issues via three characters - a South African diamond smuggler played by Leonardo di Caprio, an American journalist played by Jennifer Connelly, and a local whose family is torn apart.

Sadly Leonardo is miscast in the ""he-man"" role - he's just too nice - although his attempt at a South African accent is pretty good. Connelly is also somewhat lightweight as the journalist although she it not helped by dialogue that largely leaves her spouting polemics. The villians are merely cardboard cutouts.

The plot is all-too-contrived and cliched and builds to a predictable conclusion.

The film-makers are to be commended for bringing an important issue to a mainstream film, however, they are all-too-obvious in making their point leaving the viewer feeling preached to rather than moved.",1180742400,,972,5.09433962264151

Despite a compelling situation a couple of good acting performances, (Djimon Hounsou particularly.), great cinmetography and even score, the movie fails at making a grand slam with me.  There are way too many coinsidences and all three of our main characters are apparently shielded by a jedi's force given how they are able to dodge a billion bullets. Dicaprio's accent is strong in the begining and dies down considerably before we hit the mid marker.  It's never completely gone (circa Kevin Costner's Robin Hood) but it is noticable.

He is plays a diamond smuggler Danny Archer, the scarred survivor of a traumatic childhood. He knows no fear, having already been through everything terrible, but the in depths of his heart there is decency. The film is his odyssey through the inhumane conditions of the Sierra Leone, through slavery, torture, the separation of families, and the exploitation of the weak and innocent. The beauty of the land is in agonizing contrast to the overflowing human misery, aided and abetted by Western businessmen greedy for diamonds.

The real hero of the story is the gentle fisherman Solomon, masterfully played by Djimon Hounsou. Solomon is an example of what a father and husband should be. He puts his family above everything and is willing to risk his life to get them back after they have been taken from him. Even the precious ""blood diamond"" holds no allure for Solomon except to the degree that he can use it to save his loved ones. He cannot understand why the DiCaprio character Danny does not have a family and does not plan to use his earnings in order to get married. In Solomon's world view, family is what life is all about. Solomon's commitment to his family begins to transform the smuggler, as well as the Danny's love for the beautiful American journalist (Jennifer Connelly.) Love, as well as admiration for her dedication to human rights, inspires Danny to self-sacrifice.

The most disturbing aspect of the film is the kidnapping and brainwashing of children to be used as soldiers. The revolutionary forces would threaten and brutalize young boys into performing bloodthirsty acts. Once again, we see revolutionaries taking children away from their families and indoctrinating them. It is interesting how drugs and rock music played a significant part in the process.

It also emphasizes how helpless we all are to do anything about it. Kudos to all involved.

Sure, it's a decently executed message, but that doesn't make it a ... movie. That's right, I don't consider this a movie by any means of the imagination. Lack of solid establishing shots; lousy scenery; editing glitches and awkward transitions; mechanical, scripted acting, just to name but a few of my gripes.

Genocide is pretty much the norm for most countries, and a perpetual state of chaos is commonplace.  Only place in Africa I'd like to visit someday would be Egypt to see the Pyramids.  However, that won't be anytime soon w/all this terrorist nonsense.

Djimon Hounsou has a very powerful screen presence (and not just because he is buffed up!).  As was the case in GLADIATOR and AMISTAD, he is able to convey a lot of emotion through very few words.

650121,4,6303365752,"The screenplay of ""Blood Diamond"" may not be the best of the year, but it is certain that the strong performances from the leading stars are one of the greatest in the year 2006. Like many of the recent films shot in Africa such as ""Hotel Rwanda"" or ""Tsotsi,"" Edward Zwick's film, which is set against the background of the civil war in Sierra Leone back in 1999, has a strong message or two about the present condition of Africa.

The film's story doesn't need a lengthy summery; it is after all about two characters: South African-born mercenary-turned diamond smuggler Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), and Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), a father and fisherman living in Sierra Leone abducted by a rebel army RUF (Revolutionary United Front). You will see these two people connected by one big, pink rock, a precious diamond hidden somewhere in the land of civil war-torn Sierra Leona.

The strongest part of the film is, as I said, the acting from Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou, both truly in character. Jennifer Connelly also appears as journalist Maddy Bowen and Arnold Vosloo as ""Colonel,"" but the film belongs to the two, DiCaprio and Hounsou. The locations of Africa are also spectacular and realistic with the photography of Eduardo Serra (""Girl with a Pearl Earring""), something you can see nowhere but in this land.

Still I must say ""Blood Diamond"" is not perfect, like any other films. One weakness is its script with too many coincidences and familiar plot devices. Actions are powerful with guns and explosions, but these actions may be a little too powerful for the film to stress more effectively the immediate and complex issues in Africa. In fact, in ""Blood Diamond"" you find more than one serious issues - one about diamonds and other natural resources, or about the child soldiers, for instance - but they are overshadowed by the often melodramatic storytelling, which in itself is strong, but could have been better with a more restrained approach.

Obstacles to these goals include a brutal civil war and greedy mercenaries. Both DiCaprio and Hounson give strong performances with DiCaprio nicely managing a couple of different dialects. Jennifer Connelly is passable as the magazine writer/journalist with good intentions and the nose for a good story who befriends DiCaprio and provides minimal romantic interest. Unfortunately, the film is laced with a strong preachness that contaminates any pure, honest story-telling and descends BLOOD DIAMOND into a vehicle for political propaganda. Apparently, the movie would claim, consumers who buy diamonds are supporting all kinds of awful things, from murderous civil war to corruption to terrorism. This is a conjecture not supported by sustainable arguement in the film.

650124,4,6303365752,"From the director of Glory and The Last Samurai, Ed Zwick creates an eye opening tale that displays the violence and strife that ripped apart the City of Freetown, Sierra Leone Africa.

In 1999 Civil War between the RUFs (self proclaimed Freedom Fighters) and the government Army claimed the lives of over 200,000 Africans in Sierra Leone.  Funding for the RUFs came from diamonds, mined by the enslaved people of the region and then exported to the western world.  The education you get on this film will really make you think, if you know don't know anything about it.  Personally, I was already aware of the internal problems of Africa.  It is a country in chaos.  At this time though, the city of Freetown on the west coast was particulary hit hard.

The guilt trip the movie puts you through is unwarranted, as they state in the movie, the diamonds are mixed with stones from all over the world and then sold.  So there is no way the retailer would know, much less the consumer whether or not the stones they were buying are conflict diamonds.

The movie follows the characters as they start on different paths but eventually come together to find the Fisherman's son.  Djimon Hounsou gives a strong performance as Solomon, a father desperate to find his family after he is taken by the Rebels to pan for diamonds.  When he finds one bigger then his thumb he hides it amid a raid on the Rebels.  After being taken to jail, Danny Archer (DiCaprio) catches wind of his find and eventually convinces him to split the diamond profits.  Along the way, Archer meets Maggie (Connelly) a journalist tired of writing about the atrocities and no one noticing.  She's looking for hard evidence to write the story of her career and Danny has that evidence since he's been dealing with the illegal aspect of the trade for years.

The movie is a morality check amidst an action set piece.  The violence and gunfire add adrenaline to what could have been a boring political statement.  DiCaprio is excellent as usual and plays his part with world weary and pecimistic venom.  This is the first movie I've seen him in where he comes across as a man, and not a YOUNG man.  He seems mature, almost too mature for his age, implying he's seen too much for someone of his age.  And his military skills are very convincing.  Connelly plays the other side of the coin, pecimistic as well but hopeful that word will get out and things will change in Africa.

Eventually, things get wrapped up but not before there is a lot of sacrifice.  Some other reviews state it is a neat and tidy ending, but I disagree.  It doesn't come without death and lives changed forever.  The movie is thrilling and thought provoking even if not perfect.  I recommend it.",1179187200,,2731,4.60248447204969

650380,4,6303365752,"I lived with my family in Sierra Leone for 8 years and we were evacuated twice because of the war.

When the movie first came out in theater's I wasn't sure what to think. In telling the story of a country, there's a fine line between making it enjoyable for the person watching, and also making it realistic and accurate -- but after seeing it, I am happy to say that this movie measures up to both. I will admit that at first I did not want to watch the movie -- after all, that was my home.

It took me a very long time to build up enough courage to watch the movie, and when I did watch it, it was very difficult.

Like I said before, it was very accurate. I caught one minor mistake in the African language, and the only thing that I saw that wasn't real was the cheetah (there are no cheetahs in Sierra Leone), but other than that, I can not complain about the accuracy of the movie -- they did a very good job of making it.

They especially did a great job of portraying the nature and intentions of the RUF rebels, and their use of child soldiers, as well as the struggle that families had in staying together.

As far as the violence in concerned, I really expected this movie to be more graphic. Amputations and other forms of torture were a very big part of this war but they were only brought up a couple times in the movie, and very briefly. But I realize that the producers wanted to make the movie in a way that people would want to watch it.

The attack on the capital city really surprised me -- it was so much like the real one that I wondered how they were able to do it, until I found out that an African journalist had helped them recreate it.

This journalist had been in the capital city at the time of the attack, and in his effort to reach the rest of the world with the desperation of Sierra Leone's war, he actually stood there and videoed the attack, and sent his video footage (""Cry Freetown"") to other countries.

This same journalist assisted in the making of the movie ""Blood Diamond"" which accounts for the amazing accuracy.

Of course, the main characters in the movie are fictitious, and the plot is made up, but the war and the events that took place in the movie, they are all real.

So many people in Sierra Leone have struggled, and their stories do not all have a happy ending, but for the sake of viewer this movie did.",1178236800,,2360,4.201327433628318
650381,4,6303365752,"I do not pretend to know anything about the diamond trade. I don't know much about those who mine the stones from the ground or what hardships are suffered by those who transport the gems between the yielding earth and the finger of one's beloved. Perhaps that is the point of ""Blood Diamond,"" which tells the story of one Sierra Leonese family whose lives and fortunes are woven into the greed, violence and intrigue born of the diamond trade.

The story of ""Blood Diamond"" is simple. In the 1980s, factions within Sierra Leone, in Western Africa, used the wealth gained from the diamond trade to buy the arms that fueled a brutal civil war in that nation. More guns made for more diamonds that made for more guns in an endless cycle of death. The interest of various groups and individuals collide in this mix of adventure, greed and brutality. Journalists seek the next big story; industrial mining behemoths seek their business interests; guerrillas seek power; mercenaries seek glory and cash; foreign soldiers seek to impose peace. Caught in the middle are ordinary families trying to live an ordinary, peaceful life.

Djimon Hounsou plays Solomon Vandy, a fisherman whose family life is torn apart by the violence surrounding the diamond trade. Finding himself literally enslaved by it, he one day finds an enormous, rare pink diamond. He attempts to hide it but is spotted by one of his captors. He escapes, and the chase becomes the plot of the movie. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Danny Archer, a South African mercenary seeking his fortune in the diamond fields. Jennifer Connelly is Maddy Bowen, a journalist looking to make her own fortune in the publishing trade. Along the way, these three help each other toward a deeper awareness of the price of the trade, the hypocrisies of those who profit by denouncing it, and the need to succor those destroyed by it.

""Blood Diamond"" is incredibly violent, though not especially gory. The battle scenes are rendered with anarchic and gut-clenching verisimilitude. The film does oversimplify the diamond trade by showing it in its worst light. Though it sometimes veers toward clich (as with the Wary Renegade who trusts no one but whose actions on behalf of others redeem himself) it succeeds in humanizing a heretofore faceless trade. The diamond that graces your loved one's hand or earlobe may not have caused a family to die in violence. But does it allow the one who mined to live in a shantytown while the executive who runs the company lives in obscene wealth? ""Blood Diamond"" suggests that the answer to that question should matter.",1178064000,,2591,4.89749430523918
650382,5,6303365752,"This is a very powerful movie that wears its political views on its sleeve.  However, the performances are so good and the story so well done that I didn't really mind being manipulated even as I knew what the writers and director were trying to do to me.  They simply did it and it worked.  Of course, the movie wants us to become aware of the issue of ""blood diamonds"" or ""conflict diamonds"" and the hell on earth they finance.  When the movie ends we are all supposed to be committed to being sure that any diamonds we buy are not had at the cost of enslaving, maiming, or killing other human beings.  However, the story communicates this on the sides of the main story which centers on a single large and very rare stone worth many millions of dollars that almost no one can afford.

The country of Sierra Leone has a tortured history.  It was among the first countries through which slaves bound for North America were purchased in the seventeenth century.  After 1787, Britain founded Freetown much as America founded Liberia, as a place of return for freed slaves. And while it served as the seat for the British rule in the area, its ethnic diversity (at least 18 different groups) has led to nearly constant struggles and fighting.  Its English speaking university, Fourah Bay College, has attracted English speaking Africans from all over the West Coast of Africa.

The politics of the period of the movie in the early 1990s are hard to understand because of its sheer complexity.  The movie basically digests it into the Government forces and the RUF (Revolutionary United Front), however, in real life there were additional factions.  The point is that the Solomon Vandy character just wanted to live his life as a fisherman with his family and didn't want to get caught up in any of this gangsterism masquerading as government.

The movie centers on a Rhodesian named Danny Archer (superbly done by Leonardo DiCaprio) whose homelessness (because Rhodesia became Zimbabwe and because he lost his parents when very young) is an important theme in the movie.  Is he of Africa or is he a foreigner who doesn't belong?  He has lived by his wits and his ability to fight.  When the movie begins he is a diamond smuggler with all the hazards of that trade.

The other important story is about the aforementioned Solomon Vandy (powerfully portrayed by Djimon Hounsou) who is a simple fisherman with a wonderful family that has largely avoided the troubles.  His boy, Dia, is going to school and the family has dreams of him becoming a doctor.  Then the RUF gangs come to his village and their life will never be the same.  In the confusion, the family is fragmented into three groups with none of them knowing the whereabouts of the others or even if they live.  Solomon is actually fortunate to become enslaved working at finding diamonds for the RUF gang.  Solomon finds a huge pink stone that becomes the focus of the movie once he tries to secret it out.  Everyone wants that stone.  Everyone.  And it is that stone that brings all the elements of the rest of the story together.

The love interest, such as it is, is supplied by the danger seeking and passionate Maddy Bowen (played just right by Jennifer Connelly).  She is there to find out the story and helps us understand the whole blood diamond trade as well as tease out the background story of Danny Archer.
I cannot share any more of the story because you should see it on your own. The hellishness of Sierra Leone during this time is powerfully portrayed on the screen.  If Pittsburgh in the nineteenth century was rightly called ""Hell With the Lid Off"", Sierra Leone in the 1990s would have made Hell look like a vacation resort.

Lines get blurred between ""good"" and ""bad"" as all three of the main characters have to navigate their way to getting the things they want through a maze of war-torn Africa.

This movie succeeds in presenting an illustrative narrative that brings to light a situation that people across the globe are touched by through an intricate web of economic pressures.  On a lighter note, DiCaprio and Connelly are a sexy pair and have an unpredictable way of relating.

This is a good movie if you want a story with depth and interest.  However, it is very violent so be fair-warned.",1177891200,,738,4.771653543307087
650384,4,6303365752,"Years ago, I was shocked to find that the diamond industry was so ugly; as a result, I was anxious to see this movie. As I've said in other reviews, I don't believe it's fair to expect a movie to accurately address or solve pressing global issues. Movie making is a for profit business. The movie industry is however a powerful median; as such, has within its grasp, the power to raise public awareness. Blood Diamond was a gripping, exciting, emotional and engrossing movie from start to finish. Djimon Hounsou turns in a passionate performance as distraught father and forced laborer, Solomon Vandy and Leonardo DiCaprio delivers an interesting performance as military trained, ex-commando turned mercenary, Danny Archer. And contrary to some reviews, I thought Jennifer Connelly's portrayal as Maddy Bowen, a hungry upper middleclass, I don't mind getting dirty for a story journalist, was on target. In the end, 'Blood Diamond' delivers as a candid but entertaining story about yet another one of Africa's ugly little inhumane secrets.",1177718400,,1039,5.153846153846154
650385,5,6303365752,"To be perfectly honest, I had steered clear of this film in theaters because - Oscar-nomination notwithstanding - I dreaded the notion of potentially spending 143 minutes with Leonardo DiCaprio doing a bad South African accent in Dolby Mondo Super StereoSurround.  I mean, I have already in my lifetime endured Kevin Costner's Robin Hood and Brad Pitt's Troy on the big screen (who could forget Brad screaming ""Take it - it's YAWWWWS!"" in his British-by-way-of-Brooklyn accent?  And don't even ask me to describe Costner's...).  So, even though others assured me that Leo nailed the accent, I hope you can understand why I wouldn't want to risk another American Movie Star Mangling of an overseas accent in a heightened sensory environment.

But now that I've viewed this film in the safety of my own home with my crappy TV speakers (and my pause button at the ready), I must say that not only did DiCaprio nail the accent, but he concurrently crafted his best character and performance to date in Daniel Archer, the jaded, seen-it-all diamond smuggler who - just as the main character Solomon (Djimon Hounsou) hides and buries a valuable diamond - has hidden and buried his humanity deep within himself.  And though he sets off to find Solomon's diamond, we also see whether he can unearth his humanity along the way.  Leo adds an amazing muscular menace and aged world-weariness that I honestly didn't think he was capable of (and this is from someone who already appreciated him as an actor) (if not a dialectician).

The performance by Djimon Hounsou as stoic fisherman Solomon Vandy is almost equally stellar.  We invest in the quest completely as the wise and quiet Solomon (whose wife calls him ""Solo"") sets off alone and separated from his family, trying to find his son, who is (to him) infinitely more valuable than the diamond he has buried.  Jennifer Connelly (who, unbeknownst to the director, had already done a lot of work with UNICEF when she was cast) also adds depth in what could have been a throwaway and/or cliched role as the brash American photojournalist Maddy Bowen.

Finally, enough cannot be said about director Ed Zwick, who has already spent a good deal of his career perfecting the balance of the action movie and the more contemplative, message-driven drama (Glory, Courage Under Fire, The Last Samurai to name a few).  With ""Blood Diamond,"" he most successfully negotiates the territory between conventional action movie entertainment and more political, emotional, and darker material.

For the action scenes, the constant camera movement creates not only a documentary feel to the incessant and chaotic scenes of combat, but a sense of urgency to the events (eventually) found in the frame.  The violence is almost too real, and the acts perpetrated (in many cases by children) are almost too disturbing - such a gorgeous land frames such unspeakably evil acts, which ultimately adds greater weight to the messages of the film.

As to the message, I've heard complaints that this movie tries to bludgeon you with its politics, but I found it to actually be quite subtle, the speechifying kept to a minimum and, when employed, use to enhance and advance the arc/understanding of the character as much as the overarching ideology.

And, for me, the ""would you put a diamond on your finger if you knew it cost someone their hand"" motif - while tremendously important - is just one theme among many in this nuanced and layered work.  The film also manages to effortlessly examine other issues, such as: what is truly more valuable, material possessions or human empathy?  Where is the line between journalism and exploitation, and when is it appropriate (if ever) to cross that line?  Finally, can speaking up help change the world, and furthermore can a nation's problems be helped through the advocacy of foreign visitors, who may actually know little about the culture they are trying to change?

While Zwick and his cast may or may not be changing the world with this (mostly) American movie about an African problem, at the very least he has made an exceptionally moving film - whether you're in the mood to be educated or entertained.",1177286400,,4170,4.922967189728959

Jennifer Connelly's character leaves something to be desired, but she's still a superb actress and offers a good deal to the story, although her storyline feels a bit contrived towards the end.

He is a man with no wife, no children and since the murder of his parents, no country. Now in search of a fabulous diamond that rumor says was buried in the jungle by enforced laborer Solomon Vandy (Djimon Housou), Danny promises that he will help Solomon find his missing family if he shows him where the diamond is located. Solomon agrees and the dangerous journey begins.

`Blood Diamond' released in '06 is a taut, well executed action/adventure, drama starring two of the best actors in the business today, Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Housnsou.

Edit that out!!!  You get the feeling that there are like 6 more hours of film on the floor somewhere that they had done but cut out to try and get it down to 2 1/2 hours...and did we need the cliche ""saving the day by sacrificing ourself and dying alone and calling our true love by cell phone"" scene??  In the end the film TRYS to be an action film, it TRYS to be a romance, it TRYS to show the horrors of African Civil War, it TRYS to show the links between Western materialism/Capitalism and the ravaging of 3rd world countries, but it comes out as a mixed bag of all and none of these at the same time....In the hands of a more skilled team the film may have focused exclusively on DiCaprio's and Hounsou's characters as they are the most compelling but we are not that lucky...Entertaining?

This film was more than just a look at the problems of Sierra Leone - but looked at in great detail for the first time from Hollywood at the plight of the lost white race of Africa and how much they too love the continent and would die for it .

650490,4,6303365752,"Djimon Hounsou, who has an impressive life story himself, offers an intense performance of Solomon Vandy, a man separated from his family when the RUF (Revolutionary United Front) invades his village in Sierra Leone, killing women and children, and taking many young boys captive to serve as RUF soldiers (which has actually happened. It is estimated that some 120,000 children are currently involved in armed conflicts across Africa). Among the boys taken is Vandy's son Dia.

Solomon is put to work by the RUF, standing knee-high in a river, sifting through silt, panning for diamonds, which are traded for arms. A fellow worker is shot immediately by the boss when he is seen taking a small diamond from the pan and placing it in his mouth. Shortly after, Solomon finds a rather large diamond and, realizing that a diamond of such value could change his life and save his family, he carefully places it between his toes to hold beneath the water.

He is caught trying to bury the diamond moments later, but a sudden military attack on that particular RUF diamond operation buys him some time to run and bury the diamond a short distance away. Moments later he is captured and jailed by the government forces along with many RUF soldiers.

Leonardo DiCaprio does great job as Danny Archer, a former mercenary from Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) who served in the 32 Battalion of the South African Defence Force. He is now a diamond smuggler who works for his former commander, Colonel Koetzee, played by Arnold Vosloo. Having been caught smuggling diamonds into Liberia, Archer is arrested and placed in jail. There he hears Solomon and his RUF leader, who had seen him take the diamond, shouting about the diamond which Solomon denies knowledge of. Archer's interest is piqued and upon his release he arranges the release of Vandy, and meets with him to learn more about the diamond.

Vandy at first resists, but realizing that Archer may be his best chance at seeing his family, and getting his son back, agrees to take him to the diamond.

With the help of journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) they locate Vandy's family, but not his son. Soon they realize that the boy may have been taken to fight with the RUF

Archer and Vandy pilfer some supplies from Koetzee's installation, and head back to locate the diamond. They stumble upon an RUF outpost and Vandy spots his son. Dia, brainwashed by his captors, seems to not recognize his father. Vandy creates a scene and Archer takes cover in the jungle, escaping detection as the leader, Vandy's nemesis from his original capture, enters the scene. Vandy is tied up and faces certain death, but Archer had previously contacted Koetzee to arrange an attack, which quickly ensues.

An armed helecopter flies over the outpost, guns blaring, as Archer races in to rescue Vandy and his son. They escape, and continue on to locate the diamond.

Finally the diamond is retrieved, and after a struggle in which Koetzee attempts to take the diamond, the three make their way to an area where Archer has arranged a plane to pick them up. Archer is wounded along the way, and sacrifices himself to help Vandy and his son escape toward the air strip.

Archer also contacts Bowen, with whom he had developed some romantic interest, and asks her to do one final favor for him. The emotions play out as she realizes that he is giving up, not seeking assistance and ready to die. But she agrees to assist Vandy in selling his diamond to the company she will ultimately expose for supporting Conflict or ""Blood"" Diamond operations in Africa.

The intensity of Blood Diamond cannot be denied. The action is incredible. Great cinematography, great effects, and great acting, especially by Hounsou, who began his acting career on episodes of Beverly Hills 90210, and went on to appear in films like Amistad, Deep Rising, Gladiator, and many others, more recently Constantine and Eragon. He has also made television appearances in episodes of ER and Alias. An actor to watch for.

I've never been a real DiCaprio fan, but after this I think I'll have to give him a second chance. He was right for this roll. A great performance, and I have to give him credit for the accents he had to learn in order to play his part.

Blood Diamond, while dramatically entertaining and full of action, is also an eye-opener, raising awareness of the uprising that ocurred in Sierra Leone between 1991 and 2002. Things shown in the film -- child soldiers, severing limbs and hands -- actually took place.

Strong supporting performances from Jennifer Connolly House of Sand and Fog, Requiem for a Dream) and Djimon Hounsou (Alias Season 3, Amistad) highlight a sublime performance from Leonardo DiCaprio (The Departed, The Basketball Diaries). DiCaprio has been churning out really good performances since his Oscar-nominated role in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? It's a shame that he was thought of as just another pretty boy and that most people consider his mediocre performance in Titanic the highlight of his career. His performance in Blood Diamond should solidify his status as one of the greatest actors of his generations (and those muscles should make even more women swoon).

The subject matter of the movie is captivating and heart wrenching. This is a story that needs to be told; that must be told. And Edward Zwick (The Last Samurai, Glory) does it justice in this film.

Somewhere in the film it's mentioned that 15% of the diamond business is out of 'conflict'. Does this mean the remaining 85% of the business is coming out of completely invaded and decimated lands that there is no longer any conflict there?

This movie probably displays Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance; even better than the DiParted. While the diamond that is the center of attention in the story is priced at two million Dollars and a safe return of a family, that DiCaprio and Jennifer Connelly never kiss is priceless.

650530,4,6303365752,"In recent years, Hollywood has been on this kick of trying to make these so-called `important' films.  These are movies that attempt to call attention to something in this world, to make a statement of some sort, whatever that may be.  Generally speaking these movies are more like independent films, not widely received by the average movie audience, because in most cases the movies prove to be boring and too self-important.  Hollywood tends to get so wrapped up in trying to be so important and to rise above being pure entertainment, that it begins to talk down to the very people that keeps them in business.  Occasionally though, a movie comes along that is important for people to see, and succeeds in avoiding the pitfalls of being too self-important and hyped up to be something that it's not, and actually manages to appeal to your average moviegoer, therefore allowing the message to be heard, and maybe make a difference in the process.  One such success for Hollywood would be Edward Zwick's ""Blood Diamond"".

""Blood Diamond"" tells the story of the civil war that was overtaking Sierra Leone in 1999.  In the midst of the war, Daniel Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a diamond smuggler, befriends a Mende fisherman (Djimon Hounsou) in an attempt to recover a rare diamond of immense value.  During their search the fisherman's son is taken by rebel forces and coerced into joining their militia to survive.  Now the fisherman must stay focused enough to assist in recovering the diamond which holds the key to saving his son's life and that of the rest of his family as well.  Assisting in trying to save the fisherman's son is a reporter (Jennifer Connelly) who is trying to shed light on the war that is ravaging this part of Africa, in hopes that it will force the U.N. to intervene before it's too late.

As I stated earlier most Hollywood movies that are deemed as being `important' films, tend to not do well with most moviegoers; however, this film stood out from the rest.  Why you may ask, well because director Edward Zwick (director of ""Glory"" and ""The Last Samurai"") was smart enough to make his story be interesting and entertaining, while including some star power that would enhance his chances of getting people to come to the movie.  Sometimes putting A-list actors in a movie like this could reduce the seriousness of the picture or overshadow the message, but here the actors chosen are known for more dramatic roles and lend more weight to the movie.  Leonardo DiCaprio, who has had a recent string of highly successful dramatic roles with ""The Aviator"" and ""The Departed"", really sinks his teeth into playing the former mercenary turned smuggler.  A different role for Leo to be sure, the character is far from likeable, yet I still found myself rooting for him, but part of me believes that had more to do with Djimon's character than Leo's.  Djimon Hounsou (""The Island"" and ""Amistad"") as the Mende fisherman, Solomon Vendy, delivers another terrific performance and continues to show his range as an actor.  Jennifer Connelly (""Hulk"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"") did a fine job of conveying the conflicted nature of her character as she is torn by wanting to help Solomon, yet in the process is wanting to help herself and her career by basically exploiting his plight and that of his country's.

The story for the movie was solid and fast-paced for the most part, there were times it dragged along, but they were generally few and far between.  The action scenes were very intense, and spaced out nicely throughout the movie, although there were a couple of times that it felt as if the writers had realized it had been awhile since someone had been shot or something blown up, so they threw in a random conflict to spice things up, but other than that I couldn't complain about the amount of action.  I think as far as being an important movie for Hollywood to make, this film could serve as a semi-template for other films to follow, not in terms of what to base the subject matter on, but just the way the story was laid out and presented.  The key is not to talk down to the audience or beat them over the head with the message, but to present it to them in a way that makes them think for themselves, and still be entertained.

When it was all said and done, I would have to say that this was a very good movie, but not one that I would want to see too many times, but it definitely will open eyes to what goes on within parts of the diamond industry.  And who knows maybe it will even make somewhat of a difference.

650671,4,6303365752,"Blood Diamond tells the story of the turmoil that erupted during the late 1990s in Africa surrounding the trafficking of illegal diamonds.

He is forced to work in a diamond mine while his wife and children are spread across Africa by the corrupt rebels. Leonardo DiCaprio, as the jewel smuggler who figures why not make a quick buck even at the expense of the continent he grew up in, since everyone else seeems inclined to do so. And Jennifer Connelly, as an American journalist who is eager to spread the word of the conflict so that it gets more widespread attention and the flow of these ""blood diamonds"" will stop. As Connelly's character says, ""People back home wouldn't buy a diamond if they knew it cost someone else their hand."" Or maybe they would. Blood Diamond is a story about good and evil, right and wrong, black and white. It's a story of opposites and how different people react to crisis situations. It was entertaining, to say the least, and action-packed and exciting the whole way through. It also had a strong message, solid direction, and a great cast. As other reviewers have noted, the African continent endured war long before the trade of conflict diamonds became worldwide news, but the fact remains that there are many people in the world who probably didn't, and still don't, know much about it. Blood Diamond attempts to shed light on an important issue, and it did so with elegance and precision. I would definitely recommend it, but would add that warning that it is in no way a light film that you will watch and forget. It's message resonates, and will stay with you for days later.

The concept of the movie centers around the illegal smuggling of diamonds from Africa and the repercussions it causes the local people.  Such horrific things those people have had to endure and make you really understand the politics of that world a bit better.  It's a shame that so many parts of this world are still killing each other and oppressing weaker people for the financial gain of others.  This movie also makes you really think before you buy that diamond ring for your girlfriend.

This film is directed by Ed Zwick ( Glory, Last Samurai) He's turning into one of my favorite director, always does a fantastic just pacing the story.  He shoots beautifully and captures action and drama well.  Leo and Djimon Hounsou both did a fantastic job in this film. Leo's accent is flawless in this film and really goes toe to toe with Hounsou on the intensity.  I'm not a huge Leo fan but after works like Gangs of New York, the Aviator, the Departed and now this film I'm starting to see the appeal of him, he is a very fine young actor that is on the fast track of following in the footsteps of cinema legends like Nicholson, DeNiro, Pacino and Brando. This was a great role for him to show case many of his talents.

This film is more of a standard action/adventure type of movie that has a very nicely written script that movie the story and still give the characters time to spread their wings. You have a some sub plots going on but never lose focus that everyone wants this huge blood diamond.  This is one of those movies that is just very entertaining.  I could recommend it to most of the people that enjoy a good thought proving movie that not too deep and never try's to go over your head.

As the movie's title suggests it comes at no surprise that this film is brutal and graphic.  Fortunately, those depictions do not overshadow the underlying message of the movie.

The end of the movie is nice but that's not to say it's predictable.  During the movie, I felt like anything could happen at any given point.  Overall, it's rare to find films like that capture contemporary world history in a way that's also emotionally moving.",1175558400,,659,5.009174311926605
650674,5,6303365752,"This is a good film and that Zwick's gamble paid off at the end brings me not little pleasure. The film, mainly shot in South Africa (we see some exquisite East Coast landscapes) and Mozambiquan towns, took a tremendous effort to make, both logistically and politically.  Finally the Western audiences can see what represents daily life for many Africans.

Far for being simply PC, this film shows that Hollywwod can sometimes be genuinely concerned about the root causes of human suffering. The wars that ravaged Sierra Leone and Liberia (spreading into other neighboring countries, such as Guinea) are depicted realistically. The violent scenes were, if anything, less graphic than reality on the ground. Child soldiers intoxicated by rap, drugs and alcohol and the 'grown-up' militaries led by the likes of Samuel Doe, Charles Taylor and the RUF committed unspeakable brutalities. Can we, should we, judge them? The film depicts the indoctrination these children underwent and underscores the fact that the responsibility and real guilt for this suffering lies with the diamond traders that control the supply/demand chain. Traders, who by and large lead respectable lives in Antwerp, London, Tel Aviv and Cape Town.

Without any doubt West African atrocities are/were fueled by demand created by artificial inflation of diamond's worth. With resepct to the suffering caused to Africans, the diamond merchants of today are not much better from slave traders of the recent past - a few centuries ago similar atrocities were fueled through slave trade flourishing in the same region ('the Gold Coast', 'the Slave Coast').

The main character played by DiCaprio is a Rhodesian, an ex member of the 32nd SA battalion and the Rhodesian army. Rhodesian mercenary and counter-insurgency units were (and still are) legend material - famous around the world as perhaps some of the best trackers and fighters in history. These people also showed that fighting together is the easiest ticket to multiracial integration - as we an see today in Iraq.

DiCaprio was, for me, a great surprise. Impeccable acting; the accent, the nervous ticks and mannerisms, the naturalness all suggest he's  grown a formidable presence. The acting suggested a combination of intelligence and fierceness, an announcement of a new force on the acting scene. Connelly was consistently good. Hounsou's performance was mixed - from generic and not credible to heroic and deeply moving. Finally, the music was excellent.

All in all, an excellent film that exposes what has been going on in West Africa in the past decade or two. It is perhaps too much to hope that suckers living in 'civilized' countries will stop imbuing simple rocks with magical and romantic aura, enriching cynical diamond merchants and perpetuating the vicious cycle. Do you think you really show love for your woman by allowing De Beer to make a few hundred/thousands of dollars off of your paycheck (and naivete)? It is time to stop this anachronistic custom that is but a simulacrum for true love and commitment, or wealth. This movie is a step in the right direction.",1175558400,,3111,5.148514851485149

The violence has horrible impact here but there was not enough shown about the family and village before hand for you to have developed concern and understanding of their life.  The same for the DiCaprio character, he seems like a souless, jaded, greedy diamond trader and not much more until the movie is mostly over and you hear the deep and painful story of his childhood. He does a very good Afrikaner accent and attitude. The beautiful reporter (Jennifer Connely)in the movie is just that, almost no background to why she is there and why she risks her life to write a story about this.

There are good moments to the movie, some excellent acting by Hounsou and scenes as powerful as in Apocalypse Now.  If you could have learned more and cared more about the main characters the message and the movie would have been just as powerful.",1175472000,,1591,4.564912280701755
650677,5,6303365752,"This movie is painfully informative about the latest resource to garner war, murder, pain and suffering among african people...diamonds...the movie makes note that the largest consumer of diamonds is the U.S., inwhich diamonds trade hands from other third world nations, to its refinement and then purchase. Also, the movie informs us that diamond companies are trying to trace origins through the kemberly process, but makes note that diamonds are still smuggled and orgins remain unknown.

  The most profound movie making is the visual recruitment of child soldiers, related to the indoctrination, brainwashing, and drugging (the director's commentary explains that african civilians today have not forgiven these children for their acts of murder, regardless of their brainwashing).

  Djimon Hounsou, gave one of his best performances (deserved the Academy Award in my opinion), as the father whose son is stolen for war and finds the potential rarest diamond in the world, which he uses to find his son and reunite with his lost family. Two stunning scenes: Djimon's character escapes from a place where people are forced and killed to mine diamonds, never seeing the finished product, to peer into a London jewelry shop window for the first time to see the finished product on sale and when his son is about to shot him and he reminds his son who he is, his origin, family roots and the love for his family! Stunning!! This movie will cause you to think about diamonds in a different light.

There is a very emotional story between a father and his family and the quest to bring his son home after the boy is kidnapped by the RUF rebels and turned into a killer. This backstory behind the history brings a dose of realism to the characters that we can sink an attachment into. We really care about the story and what happens to the people in it; something that is often missing from many action packed films. Leo DiCaprio does a masterful job with the dialect and acting, along with Djimon Hounsou and Jennifer Connelly. This is a splendid screenplay that's well balanced, entertaining and at the same time complex in its description of just one of the many long struggles in Africa. Exceptional movie, brilliant acting! If I'd been a judge it would've won several Oscars.

650741,5,6303365752,"One of the best movies of 2006, ""Blood Diamond"" combines the action movie with the heart-rending 'issues' movie - films like ""Hotel Rwanda"", ""Dirty Pretty Things"" and ""Rabbitproof Fence"", which feature stories of real-life atrocities that have taken place or are still taking place.  The meld is extremely potent - the seriousness of the issues presented is never minimilized or brushed off, but the fact that the movie is a fictionalized account of a real situation provides for the welcome possibility of a somewhat happier ending for the innocents than usually happens in 'true story' movies like this, and the tantalizing lure that the heinous villains may not escape justice as they so often do in real life.  (On the other hand, ""Blood Diamond"" is grim enough that neither of those possibilities seems guaranteed, generating tremendous suspense).  On the action movie front, the fact that these bad guys are right out of the papers and evening news makes it impossible not to root against them with a particular vengeance.  The stakes seem much higher than in many action movies and have a profound effect on the heart.

  Taking place in the '90s civil war of Sierra Leone, the ""Blood Diamond"" of the title refers to diamonds which, like many other valuable substances, have been mined in Africa by slave labor repeatedly in recent years to pay for war efforts on behalf of both ruthless rebel factions and brutal governments.  The diamond end of this appaling tragedy has to a large degree been cleaned up by the establishment of the Kimberly Process (designed to keep 'blood diamonds' off the open market) but the practice was in full swing at the time the story here takes place.  Djimon Hounsou plays the father of a family in a village where rebels come to abduct the population - to turn the young into brainwashed 'child soldiers' and to press many of the adults into slave labor in the diamond rivers.  Leonardo DiCaprio plays a smuggler/mercenary who has dealings with the rebel group, and who comes to a stage in his life where he has to decide if it's too late to try and turn away from the brutal way he's lived his life.  Jennifer Connelly plays a journalist in Africa trying to gather evidence to expose the blood diamond trade and its links to rich Western corporations.  Her character, Maddy, has piled up a track record of uncovering similiar abuses all over the world.  In an ordinary movie, any one of these three stars would steal the show, but in ""Blood Diamond"" all three lead players deliver astonishing performances.  So, in fact, does the entire supporting cast.  The discovery in the slave rivers of one of the largest diamonds in the world (worth millions) and, moreover, the quest of Hounsou's character Solomon Vandy to escape and rescue his family (including the son that's been taken by the rebels) and the various characters who risk their lives to help him, provide main points for the movie.

  In terms of production, everything's perfect - the action sequences, the cinematography, the musical score, everything.  The lush natural beauty of Sierra Leone is captured amazingly well, and having such breat-taking natural imagery as the backdrop for such a brutal series of events is poignant, to say the least.

  Excellent in every respect, one of the very best picks from a year that was loaded with great movies.",1175299200,,3356,4.8611599297012305
650742,5,6303365752,"Blood Diamond was a film that I didn't really want to see but I wanted to see. I didn't want to see it because the things I was told about it didn't really make me too happy. Blood diamonds or conflict diamonds are diamonds mined in war zones and sold to finance the conflicts. I remember as a child my mom would tell me that there're places in Africa where you could walk down the roads and find diamonds and jewels in the ground. Of course I didn't totally believe her then cause I was like 6 but after seeing this you come to see how valuable and beautiful Africa really is.

The film is set in 1999 in the Sierra Leone civil war the country is at a constant struggle with fights between government soldiers and rebel forces. The rebels named RUF are pretty much past crazy, invading villages, cutting off innocent peoples hands so they're unable to vote and taking strong men to mine and young children to mold into little soldiers. Everything starts with Solomon Vandy, a good man with a good family and his son is a good student. One day while walking home with his son after catching some fish a few trucks playing music come speeding behind them. There are armed men in the truck and Vandy immediately knows trouble is coming. He runs to his village in a great panic to get the rest of his family out but the men get there first and are already just killing whoever. Vandy gets his family out but he gets caught and is sent to work the mines in search of diamonds.

While working the mines Vandy finds one of the largest and rarest diamonds ever. Somehow he sneaks off to hide the diamond and lucky for him government troops attack just as a RUF soldier sees what he's doing. Unfortunately Vandy gets caught and is arrested along with the injured soldier. While in prison the soldier shouts what he saw Vandy do and says he will give money to anyone who gets the truth out of him. Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) trades weapons for diamonds and overhears the talk between Solomon and the soldier. Archer is quick to help Solomon get out and then starts harassing him to get the diamond. A number of events occur that just making everything worse, the absolute worse being Solomon's son getting kidnapped but RUF and made a little soldier. Now Vandy must get his child back and goes on a hard journey to get the diamond and his child.

First of all things I can't believe Djimon Hounsou didn't win Best Supporting Actor for this film. Seeing him in the previews going crazy to find his son was even getting to me. I don't think I could explain how powerful his performance was in this film. It was so realistic and perfected that you had to feel his pain. The scene at the end with when he tries to bring his brainwashed sons mind back was amazing. I saw Little Miss Sunshine and not to take anything from Alan Arkin but that was nothing compared to Hounsou in this film, Hounsou should've been the one that walked out. I too have never really been a Leo fan but you can't deny that he has a great talent. He plays Danny Archer on point and never lets the character go. This film would not be what it is without the great acting and the settings of Africa were beautiful. I'm not exactly sure how accurate this movie is with the history but overall it's a great film and is a must see.",1175212800,,3293,4.359934853420196
650743,5,6303365752,"Not being a very big Leonardo DiCaprio fan in the past, this year I've had a growing amount of respect for this young man as he proves his acting chops again and again. First it was within the excellent Scorsese film THE DEPARTED, and now he does another great job in BLOOD DIAMOND.

For some reason, this film stands out above The Departed for me. Where the Departed had an ensemble cast, Blood Diamond can make no such claim (although there is a sprinkling of well-knowns). Many African actors lend their previously hidden talents to the film, giving it a bit more authenticity than The Departed. Most notably among them is the buffed Djimon Hounsou (AMISTAD), a quiet man living in a quiet village that is torn apart by rebel fighters trying for a piece of the region's diamond trade. Djimon plays the smart and tough Solomon as he races to find his family and his son. After being imprisoned via slave labor by the rebels, Solomon finds a huge, rare, pink diamond and quickly buries it. Having been seen with the diamond, the rebel leader tries to hunt him down.

In the meantime, Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio, THE DEPARTED), a young opportunist from South Africa, is completely immersed in the illegal diamond trade. He runs into Maddy (Jennifer Connelly, DARK WATER), an attractive journalist from The States who infuses Danny with a sense of morality. Uncomfortable around Maddy, yet still attracted to her physically and emotionally, Danny sets out to find if the rumor he's been hearing about the large, pink diamond are true. He meets up with Solomon and the two form a tenuous bond; Danny wants the diamond so that he can escape Africa and thus his past, while Solomon sees it as a way to possibly save his missing son who's been captured and brainwashed by the rebels.

As Maddy's views of right and wrong spin Danny on his head, and Solomon's race to find his son sparks memories of his father, Danny's not only in for a physical battle, but one that'll force him to deal with his own immoral and prejudicial history.

Part nonfiction, part fiction, Blood Diamond forces the viewer to realize that the rocks they wear on their fingers may have come at a very bloody cost. The movie spares nothing to get its message across; there are children being dismembered, children carrying guns and spraying bullets onto innocent villagers, torture, explosive governmental flaws, and it's all surrounded by one terrible little stone: the diamond.

A very compelling film with DiCaprio dominating the screen (and rightfully so). His South African accent was spot-on and his internal battles of right and wrong are pulled off effortlessly.

650744,2,6303365752,"Blood Diamond is a message film.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers make the common mistake of assuming that their audience is too stupid to get the message.

The plot is a thin excuse to visit all of the unhappy sites around Sierra Leone and to revel in the atrocities being performed there.  Really, how many times do we have to see children committing murder before we get the point?

The dialog is very poor.  In fact, most of it will fit comfortably on a bumper sticker.  The worst offender is the often quoted phase ""This is Africa"" or TIA for short.  It must be important because they made it an acronym.  Right?  Wrong, it seems to invite the audience to ignore the central message of the film.  As if the filmmakers are saying, ""Yes, audience, there really is no reason for the atrocities, it is just Africa. Ha, ha, fooled you!""

The ending of the film is predictable.  I am sorry to say that anyone who has not figured out the ending after watching the first hour of the film fully meets the expectations of the filmmakers.

I am not fond of message films.  I thought that given the quality cast and crew -- not to mention five Academy Award nominations -- that Blood Diamond might rise above the run-of-the-mill message films and actually be a good movie.  I was wrong.

Ironically, there is a good ninety-minute movie -- message and all -- buried deep inside Blood Diamond.  If only the filmmakers had cut about fifty minute's worth of redundant violence...

Dah, this is a message film (TMF)!  What am I thinking?",1174867200,,1523,4.574074074074074
650745,5,6303365752,"You know, I wanted to see this because it was nominated for best picture but in a weird way my expectations were not that high.

I don't know why I felt that but it must have been some combination of the marketing, the best picture nom in itself and the subject matter.  Everything about it screamed ""Important"".  Anyway, I saw it this weekend and it is actually excellent.  This is a great story.  DiCaprio does a great job as a menacing but very human South African mercenary (I think I was not sure this role would be a good match for him), there is lots of action and a moving story at the core. I actually think it was better than The Departed.  So in case you're on the fence about getting it because you think it might be all ""best picture""-y, don't worry about it.  It's a lot of fun too.",1174867200,,902,4.295857988165681
650746,3,6303365752,"Leonardo Di Caprio, a diamond mercenary with a British accent - weird. The guy's just too boyish, insufficiently rugged or 'toughed' for this role (although I thought he pulled off his character in The Departed very nicely). Jennifer Connelly looking too pretty for a war-torn context (better was Monica Bellucci, another bombshell ducking bombs in Tears of the Sun). Djimon Hounsou intimidatingly genuine in his role as desperate father. His Oscar nomination is no surprise.

DiCaprio, Hounsou, Connelly, diamonds - and lots and lots of blood in Africa.

Blood Diamond is an attempt to get people to wake up to reality of death, atrocities, bloodbaths and refugees in Africa. A reality shunned by the Western politics, financed by Western corporatocracy, and glossed over by the Western media (there's a good line by Connelly's character when she sees a million-inhabitant refugee camp and states that we'll only get a glimpse of it in CNN, ""somewhere between Sports and Weather"").

The movie opens with Solomon Vandy (damn good name, IMO) being kidnapped from his family to work in diamonds run by the Revolutionary United Front. The RUF are  anti-government rebels whose modus operandi seems to be pillaging and burning villages, chopping off hands (so the people can't vote - now that's new), shooting women and children, and enslaving able-bodied men (there's some black comedy in how the RUF commanders, overseeing their prisoners breaking their backs sifting for diamonds in the rivers and just before shooting people point-blank, can say, ""Here, there are no masters and slaves!"")

On account of a government attack on the mines, Vandy is imprisoned but only after he managed to bury a huge diamond he found. This secret can't be kept entirely and he's later set free by Archer who's determined to get the diamond himself. The deal is that Vandy helps Archer in return for assistance in finding his family. Along comes Bowen, a journalist who wants to expose the truth about the illegal diamond trade and whose help Archer and Vandy needs to make it to the site where the diamond was buried.

Somewhere between all this (and the reasonably predictable ending - don't tell me you think everyone's going to get rich, be heroes and live happily after?) you get Archer saying ""Huh?"" a hundred times (which served to be more of a distraction than much else).

You get great shots of bazooka-inspired destruction and other intense battle scenes of the civil war. You get Archer making the all-too-familiar quote, last made by Bruce Willis in Tears, about how God has ""already left Africa"". You get half a dozen mini-pep talks about how nothing can be done to resolve the situation (and serious cliches like, ""Why are our own people doing this to each other?""). You'll also get a half-chilling new acronym, TIA, the meaning of which I'll leave it to you to find out.

You get an unrealistic half-romance between Archer and Bowen (who, like I said, looks way too LA-girl-who-wants-to-make-a-diff for this movie). Quite unexpected is the violent indoctrination by the RUF of children kidnapped from villages (think of Kurt Russell's Soldier with a lot less technology, fashion and suave) which included front-lining the next village massacre, being forced to take drugs, gambling - all a growing boy needs, huh?

The sad thing is there'll be charity in hell before countries who can afford to give aid do so in reasonable amounts. And even if they do, Africans themselves can't seem to eliminate the (tribal?) proclivity to occasionally wipe each other out.

How can the diamond trade be made to bring real development to their source-countries? How can the violence be ended? How can big corporations be made to serve the Third World instead of the opposite? And - probably the most important question raised by the film - how do we get people to give a damn?",1174780800,,3859,4.9689922480620154
650747,5,6303365752,"Well, there's already several long and detailed reviews about this film, so I'll just keep mine sort and to the point.

Obviously this movie tells the tale of the Civil War in Sierra Leone over ""conflict diamonds"" in the late '90s...specifically 1999.  Conflict diamonds are basically those that are mined in Sierra Leone, but then smuggled into neighboring countries like Liberia (which was lead at the time by Charles Taylor) and then sold on the black market for much more than what the government Sierra Leone would be willing to pay and then sell them for.

This lead to a group of rebels (the RUF - Revolutionary United Front) to spring up to oppose the government.  However these rebels were brutal in their diamond mining process.  They'd shoot anybody that didn't provide their share of slave work to mine the diamonds, basically.  This got to the point of slaughtering entire villages and then even the capital city, Freetown.  It wasn't until 2003 when a Treaty was signed by all diamond-producing African countries to keep ""conflict diamonds"" out of Western retailers.  However, this treaty isn't perfect and even to this day, many diamonds make it through this somewhat loose treaty and make it to stores near you.

I may sound like a bleeding heart liberal on this issue, but this is pretty much the only issue I feel this way about.  I'm pretty much a hard conservative when it comes to everything else, but mining diamonds is pretty much legalized slavery and people die for the slighest infringement on their so-called duties.  Women really need to think twice before they request a huge rock from their fiances.  How many people have to die for you to wear a piece of ice?",1174780800,,1690,4.789655172413793
650748,4,6303365752,"Hollywood's attempts at social conscience films in the past several years have been self-indulgent, fractured narratives tailored for self-congratulatory Academy Awards shows. They're barely watchable, much less entertaining. ""Blood Diamond"" is a welcome exception. An action film with attractive, involving characters and memorable -though unoriginal- dialogue, ""Blood Diamond"" is set in Sierra Leone in 1999, during the country's bloody civil war in which the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) murdered, maimed, and displaced millions in its attempt to control and profit from the nation's diamond fields.

Mercenary soldier Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) smuggles diamonds from Sierra Leone into Liberia, where they eventually make their way into the vaults of the world's largest diamond conglomerate Van de Kaap. Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is a fisherman forced to work in the diamond fields when his village was ravaged by the RUF. When both men are briefly held in the same jail in Freetown, Danny learns that Solomon has hidden a large pink diamond. Danny needs to reimburse his commander for a lost shipment, so he promises Solomon help in finding his family in exchange for the location of the stone. At the same time, he implores American journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) for assistance in exchange for damning information on the diamond trade.

Djimon Hounsou is a powerful, empathetic presence throughout ""Blood Diamond"", and Jennifer Connelly makes Maddy's sense of adventure, bravery, and commitment to her beliefs infectious. But it is Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of sharp, wounded, resourceful Danny Archer that pulls the audience into this film. Danny's unyielding determination to survive, his relentless motion in the direction of necessity is ""Blood Diamond""'s driving force. DiCaprio deserved the praise he received for this performance. The extended sequence of the RUF's assault on Freetown is one of the most memorable depictions of war that I've seen on film. My hat is off to director Edward Zwick, cinematographer Eduardo Serra, and production designer Dan Weil for this surreal spectacle.

The civil war in Sierra Leone ended in 2002, and there are now considerably fewer conflict diamonds than in the 1990s. So in some ways this film is old news. But conflict diamonds, which are used to finance violent revolutionary movements and general mayhem, are still very much an issue among human rights activists and critics of the diamond industry. It may be inevitable that the politics of ""Blood Diamond"" are murky, since the events it depicts are impenetrable. The filmmakers are obviously trying to raise awareness about what one may be subsidizing in purchasing diamonds. But Van de Kaap is an unveiled stand-in for De Beers, and it isn't clear to me what the film wants to say about them. Van de Kaap buys conflict diamonds in order to control the price of diamonds on the world market. But Van de Kaap also supports the mercenary army hired to rout out the RUF. In spite of their representative being a rich, smarmy white man, I'm not sure that this makes Van de Kaap a villain. But then De Beers' relationship to conflict diamonds has never been clear.

The DVD (Warner Bros. 2007 single disc): Bonus features on the single disc edition of the DVD are a theatrical trailer (2 min) and an audio commentary by director Edward Zwick. Zwick discusses Sierra Leone's history and politics, but not as much as I would have liked and not enough to clear up the nebulous points in the plot. He does talk about the cultural connections between Sierra Leone and the Western world, the plight of the child soldiers, and how he approached depicting real events. Zwick also addresses the challenges of filming, cinematography, how he got the necessary exposition into the film, and filming on location in Mozambique and South Africa.

Where this film fails is in the inane dialogue. This is particularly true of the drek that is given to DiCaprio and Connelly. Two actors of such calibre deseved better than this.

Though a bit too long at two and a half hours the story is not only a dramatically viable one for a film, but it also has much to say about human interaction and the sanctity of friendship.

Solomon Bo (Djimon Hounsou) is a fisherman who becomes indentured to the evil men who search for diamonds after being separated form his family and in the course of working for the vile men who are in the illegal diamond industry he discovers a huge pink diamond and hides it form the overseers. He is caught, jailed, and while imprisoned he is observed by a Rhodesian white man Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) who discovers Solomon's secret and arranges for him to be released from prison with money to salvage his life.  However, we discover that Danny is in the black market end of the diamond trade and Danny promises Solomon he will get his family back for him if Solomon shares the hidden pink diamond. A journalist Maddy (Jennifer Connelly) finds Danny and recognizes a good resource for a revealing article about the diamond trade.  Danny and Maddy form an alliance: the rest of the film consists of the chases to recover the diamond with Danny and Solomon bonding and attempting to avoid every manner of interloper.

The performances by DiCaprio, Hounsou, and Connelly are superb but there are also fine performances in the smaller roles filled with such actors as Michael Sheen, Kagiso Kuypers, Benu Mabhena, Jimi Mistry, and Stephen Collins.  The cinematography by Eduardo Serra manages to capture the beauty of the country as well as the horror of the battles.

DiCaprio is solid as ever but the films theme is slightly muddled. It's a little bit like Indiana Jones meets City of God. An odd comibination to be sure. It works well at times, but at others it's hard to tell whether its a light-hearted romp or a political piece of film-making. I liked it though, and it's deinitely worth a look as it's fairly unique.",1174435200,,524,4.46875

And the slavery keeps happening because greedy pigs all over the world feel the need to be draped in diamonds.

650824,5,6303365752,"I am going to keep this review relevant to the movie and the reasons why you should buy this on DVD:

1. Leonardo DiCaprio's Performance: This film in my opinion features the best ever performance extracted from Leonardo DiCaprio on film. He is flawless here as a South Africa white who needs to discover whether material wealth means more to him than human emotion and sentiment. I have never been a huge fan of Leo (though yes, he was wonderful in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" and ""The Beach"") but this film alongwith ""The Departed"" really opened my eyes. Granted he is a physically splendid creation, but his use of language, intonation and emotion were at the forefront of this movie, and the only downside to his performance is that it totally overshadowed the other actors.

2. Djimon Hounsou's performance : This was an actor I first noticed in ""Amistad"" and he just keeps getting better and better. He is one actor who looks about 25 even though hes well past 40, and has an incredible range. His role as a traumatized father looking for his son in the middle of riot torn Africa will be remembered years to come, however, he is not as radiant as Leonardo here, and for that reason alone I think he is thought of as a ""supporting actor"" here. If you pay attention, you will actually see that he gets MORE screen time than Leo.

3. Jennifer Connelly : I think she is one of the most ill-utilized actresses we have today, and the director doesn't do much with her here either, which is a pity. However, her role is quite effective for what it is - the downside being that she has zero chemistry with Leo in every regard.

4. Cinematography : The effect here was to present Africa as a beautiful nation though ridden with political problems and woes. To see these violent images portrayed against a backdrop of the most gorgeous sunsets and tropical rainforests was a bit bizarre - which I suppose was the effect. The visuals are lush and evocative, and captures the mood of the era and environment perfectly.

5. Direction & Story : The director knew a good thing when he saw it. This is a very character driven story and you have to FEEL for the characters' emotions if you want to get anywhere. On the surface, its a simple tale thats been told a million different ways, but the political statements this movie makes is way ahead of its' time, I thought (much like the Angelina Jolie starrer ""Beyond Borders"" which was a masterpiece in its' own right).

It goes without saying that Leonardo DiCaprio carries this film on his capable shoulders and takes you through almost three gripping hours of it without making you look at your watch. This is what real acting and filmmaking is all about. If you do decide to buy this, let Leo be your number one reason.

To wrap it up, this is a must have 2-DVD Edition of the film - and I can state that this is one movie you will be watching over and over. I saw this just after ""The Departed"", which is the only other movie this year I could possibly watch again. These two films finally signal the true emergence of America's greatest living actor - Leonardo DiCaprio.",1173830400,,3118,4.5177304964539005
650825,5,6303365752,"What a rebirth indeed. Di Caprio is finally finding his way to some adult roles. He learned the trade from Scorsese and The Departed. Now he pushes it into some thickening and intensity in this film. He knows how to use his facial expressivity to mean cynicism, hatred, violence, meanness, viciousness, cruelty, etc... though not yet the rising physical desire that may accept to condescend to turn into something more intense, even passionate. That's his face, and close-ups are numerous. Yet his body language does not remain that coherent and he still keeps some of his adolescent even pubescent lascivity in some attitudes and movements. He will learn, they say, provided they do not lock him up in roles of villains just the way they had locked him up in roles of smooth-skinned and practically hairless desirable adolescents, in spite of Basketball Diaries where he had quite another potential. So Leonardo Di Caprio is coming of age and may have found a completely new field of artistic expression. Yet the film was expected for a completely different reason. The mythic scandal of our modern world: the wars both for and fed by diamonds in Africa but waged by children soldiers who enrich some weapon dealers and diamond speculators with not only their blood, but also the blood of their parents shed by and with their own hands. The film is poignant because of the presence of several artists, the main black actor of course but also Emmanuel Jal and his music, who were children soldiers themselves. This film is ruthless, systematic, unavoidable in the obvious conclusion that the rich of this world need these wars to become richer. This commitment of an actor like Leonardo Di Caprio to this necessary struggle to make our world more humane, can only help millions of people to understand those wars have to stop, not be stopped by tyrannical foreign military interventions, but by negotiations, economic sanctions and sentences against those who are responsible for these unacceptable feudal if not even more primitive ambitions that can only be fulfilled by the enslavement of millions and the victimization of all those who are not members of the closed clan of power they are part of. It is good Hollywood gets aboard the train to humanistic globalization.

650826,5,6303365752,"""Blood Diamond"" is one of the best movies of the last 10 years, if not even longer. The story is gripping, gruesome, heroic, heartfelt, and grand. The setting in war torn Sierra Leone is all too realistic and the performances are nothing if not top notch. Especially Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou play their characters superbly. DiCaprio as the white African mercenary who wants out of the industry, looks and breathes life into the character with a superb linguistic performance and a ""feel"" that makes you believe that there's a lot more hidden inside him than what one can see, smell and hear. Hounsou as the good, caring and at times almost desperate father who wants nothing but to save his family caught in the civil war delivers a powerful and honest performance and has a very strong presence in all the scenes he's in.

  Also director Edward Zwick succeeds in making a fast paced, action packed, yet very emotional and hardbreaking story. Neither too little nor too much is shown. It's just right. Splendid work.

  The story is also well written and well thought through, so kudos to Charles Leavitt aswell.

  Overall, the movie is great and raises some very valid questions about the exploitation of Africa by the USA and Europe. It treads the same path of ""entertaining enlightenment"" as ""Lord of War"" and ""the Mission Song"" by John Le Carr before it.

  A very good movie indeed.",1172793600,,1401,4.791666666666667
650827,4,6303365752,"Blood Diamond is a brilliant and gripping movie and is by far the best film I have seen this year. It's combination of realistic storytelling, spot on acting and all out action scenes is what makes this movie work so well. I must tell you though that this film is definitely not for the faint hearted as a lot of scenes can be quite violent and bloody.

The movie is set in 1990's Sierra Leone against the backdrop of a raging civil war and is the story of two men, Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) and Danny Archer (Leonardo Di Caprio) whom have to work together in order to find a rare pink diamond. While in prison for smuggling, Archer learns that Solomon, who was captured by anti-goverment rebels and forced pan for diamonds, has found and hidden the stone. So with the help of an American journalist named Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), the two set off on a dangerous journey into rebel territory to find the diamond.

The movie is directed by Ed Zwick whom also directed `The Last Samurai' and `Glory'. I think he has done a brilliant job bringing this movie to the screen because he has managed to convey both the dramatic aspects of the story and the fanatstic action sequences without it leaning to one side. This is what I believe will keep audiences gripped to the end, like it did with me. Another aspect that kept me entertained throughout was the chemistry between the two lead characters and the way that DiCaprio's character `Archer', changes over the course of the film.

Overall I think both DiCaprio and Hounsou have done a great job and both deserve oscar's for their performances. Jennifer Conelly didn't have such a major role but she was also good in the film. But mainly I would have to give credit to the writer and director, whom have manged to bring to the screen an intriguing and gripping movie. 9/10",1172707200,,1831,4.576219512195122
650828,5,6303365752,"TIA in the slang of former South African and Rhodesian soldiers, now working as mercenaries means This Is Africa, a phrase which is used to sum up the brutality of the life that they have chosen.

Set in Sierra Leone during the vicious civil war, Blood Diamond sees a fisherman played superbly by Djimon Hounsou, captured by rebels and forced to work as a slave labourer in a diamond mine. Here life is brutish and short. Hounsou, however, finds a priceless pink diamond which he hides and then escapes during an attack on the mine.
Leonardo Di Caprio gives a very strong performance, indeed, as Danny, a former Rhodesian soldier now working as a mercenary, and for himself in smuggling diamonds... Danny enounters Hounsou while in the same jail and learns of this pricless diamond that Hounsou has hidden. Eventually persuading a reluctant Hounsou to join him, they head back on a dangerous quest into the jungle to locate this priceless item. Hounsou, however, is less concerned with finding the diamond as opposed to rescuing his son from the rebels. Unfortunately his son has become on of the many 'child soldiers' terrorising the country with the rebels...

Di Caprio comes of age in this role and is superb as the cynical Danny and manages a quite convincing Rhodesian accent. Ultimately his journey with Hounsou will change his view on life, as he loses his cynicism and selfishness, and finally begins to understand the awful tragedy which is unfolding around him.
Jennifer Connolly plays his love interest, a journalist looking for a story on the source of 'blood diamonds'. Arnold (The Mummy) Vosloo plays Di Caprio's scheming and traitorous commanding officer.

As a film, Blood Diamond works very well as an adventure film. It is also an eye opener for those who are unaware of the trade in blood diamonds and the awful price paid in human life to get these diamonds to the shops for the affluent to buy in First World society.

The movie itself isn't the best-made film there is out there but it's a shocking and very often nauseating look at the war-ravaged third world nationals forced to produce ""blood"" diamonds (diamonds which encourage conflicts and wars) for the wealthy and influential diamonds merchants in developed nations.  Take heed, this film is NOT FOR CHILDREN.  It's practically not even for adults!  The violence almost made me sick.  But it's the kind of violence which actual blood diamonds bring about and to discount that by sugarcoating or censoring it would have done this film a great disservice.

Aside from the accent, he plays his character with much conviction and believability. Djimon Housou is also very good in this movie although he is somewhat betrayed by having to play yet another martyr type role.

650902,5,6303365752,"Who knew something so beautiful comes with such an ugly history behind it. The simple diamond has become director Ed Zwick's latest interest, and here he explores this rock in such depth and detail, it is both amazing and scary. One thing is for sure, I will never look at diamonds the same way.

Danny Archer is a diamond smuggler, a Rhodesian who has ties to some large corporations, like Van De Kaap. Soloman Vandy is a fisherman from a local village that is pillaged by rebels R.U.F. who are at civil war vying for diamond fields. Danny gets caught by the local government trying to smuggle diamonds out of Africa and is put in jail. Soloman is separated from his family during the destruction of his village, and the rebels take him in to help them harvest diamonds. He comes upon a pink diamond, a large rock, one of the rarest in the world. Soon after, while struggling with Captain Poison, a rebel leader who finds out about the diamond, the rebel camp is attacked by the government's military unit and he is forced to bury the diamond. With a twist of fate, he ends up in the same prison where Danny is. Danny finds out about the diamond, and in a bid to repay what he lost when he was caught, and also to get out of Africa, he arranges to get Soloman out of prison and engage his help to find the diamond. In return, he promises Soloman to help locate his family. At around the same time, Danny also meets Maddy, a journalist who aspires to uncover the truth about conflict diamonds, that these diamonds reach the shores of countries like the U.S or England, and that large corporations are hiding that fact. Danny agrees to help her, if she would use her influence as a journalist to find Soloman's family. ""Yes, I am using him and you are using me, and that's how it goes,"" Danny says. The story ensues...

The story, while totally riveting in it's delivery, never clouds the backbone of this movie, the illegal mining of these conflict diamonds, and its effects on the country and the people. Back when this story was set, I was still a teenager and oblivious to these issues. I'm guessing many adults were, too. I read many reviews criticizing Blood Diamond, saying that it felt like a documentary. Isn't that a compliment? To be able to provoke some sort of emotion upon viewing the horrifying acts of man for money and power. To watch young children recruited by the rebels to kill, trained to have no conscience whatsoever. It is really sad to think that all these was happening just a few years ago, and probably still is, although not as much. Your heart goes out to these people who have been enslaved and tortured. One character says ""Thank God they did not find oil.""

The acting is top notch. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a consistently great performance in every movie he's in and it's no exception here. He is unflinching as the ruthless Danny Archer. Definitely not playing to the usual hero mold, he is never really the good guy throughout the movie, even in the end his moral obligation is somewhat questionable. He always has an ulterior motive. The only times we see his vulnerabilities is when he is talking with Maddy. One of my favorite lines from the movie is uttered here. ""Sometimes I wonder if God will ever forgive us for what we've done to each other...then I look around and I realize, God left this place a long time ago."" Delivered with such emotion that it simply grabs you. A well deserved Oscar nomination for his role here. Another great actor is Djimon Honsou, playing Soloman Vandy. Soloman is a simple man, a family-oriented guy who cares about nothing else but his family. He is naive in a sense and when his family is taken, you can feel the grief in him. He is overwhelmed with what is happening around him. Where Danny blends perfectly with this environment, Soloman seems struggling to apprehend it. And Jennifer Connelly plays the journalist, Maddy Bowen. Maddy has a great intensity to know the real story behind this industry, but we, the audience are always left questioning, will that knowledge change anything? She certainly feels it will and is unwavering in her mission to find out. Danny and Maddy had some great chemistry, and ultimately that connection between them plays a vital role in the end of the movie.

Other than this, many other factors contribute to the success of this movie. The cinematography is brilliant. It depicts the civil war to an amazing level of realism. The music was also fantastic, infusing native sounds with orchestral elements to create a sweeping score of epic proportions. I am also eagerly anticipating this 2-disc DVD set, particularly because I am very interested to see how Ed Zwick delved into this industry, how he researched blood diamonds, the smuggling of this rocks, the people behind it, the wars and how the actors themselves prepared for the roles.

In the end, the true power of this movie transcends what can be seen on the screen. It really is more about what is felt upon watching this movie. Sure, finally everything is tied up with a nice little bow, but the movie claims that civil unrest still exists in the nation of Africa. Parts of the problem are resolved, but for every solution, there is a new problem creeping up. Ultimately, I'm guessing that this movie was not made with the idea of finding a resolution to the wars, but I think for it to even make us think about the consequences of buying conflict diamonds, to give us a ""pang"" of realization what occurs behind the scenes of how these magnificent jewels are obtained is a huge success in itself. And it certainly did do exactly that for me. Powerful, compelling and real would be some of the words I would choose to describe this awe-inspiring movie. A superb effort and one the best pictures I have seen. Wholeheartedly recommended.",1170979200,,5810,4.631425800193987
650903,4,6303365752,"I always thought of Leonardo DiCaprio as a bit of a 'twit', as the English say. But I must admit, I believed every second of his portrayal of Danny Archer, the un-PC Rhodesian mercenary. More than I believed any of the other characters, except maybe Arnold Vosloo. In fact, DiCaprio was the character that turned this super-PC movie into something that went beyond that and thereby, and despite its ""I'm Important!""-shouting ending, made it into a 'good' movie.

Jennifer Connelly and Djimon Hounsou were burdened with lines so loaded with 'message' that it was almost cringe-factor-10 material. That they managed it to deliver most of them without me wanting to duck every time one of those lines was coming, is a testament to their skill. But in the end it was DiCaprio's sustained characterization--and accent!--that kept it all going.

Blood Diamond, whose best and most enduring lines were those relating to the acronym 'TIA' (This Is Africa), wears the 'important' label like a General wears his decorations. Still, its impact is lost in overkill. The same movie without the message-bits would have been simply superb. And without that hokey ending, of course. Does anybody really believe that this trade is ever going to stop? Does anybody really believe that the true evildoers are the traders, middle-men, corrupt government officials, local potentates--and not the ultimate buyers themselves: the people of small minds and/or stupid vanities? For the majority of these diamonds do not go to the rich and powerful, but to those who flood into the local cheap-special-offer jewelry store when the occasions for buying arise or are fabricated by the peddlers of the goods. Without customers there are no middle-men and peddlers turn their attention to something people will buy instead.

Apart from all that, let's look at another message of this movie: the one  about the child-soldiers in Africa, and everywhere else, for that matter. The Hitlerjugend happened in the middle of Europe, remember--and there's nothing new about this anyway. When you need some killers and are running out of grown-ups, the young are the most impressionable and easiest to mold. Even volunteer armies consist mostly of those qualifying as 'young'--and for good reasons, one of which is that in their brains one is more likely to find 'impressionability' and a lack of big-picture judgment. I believe the age of cerebral maturity is somewhere around the age of 25. Most soldiers are significantly younger than that.

So, nothing new about child-soldiers, and if anybody thinks that's going to change, think again. The point was that as a 'point' to be made in a movie, Blood Diamond practiced overkill. The same point was made with much more impact and much more to the gut in Tears of The Sun, when one of the team of SEALs, while interfering in some ethnic cleansing in the middle of the jungle, killed one of those in the process of some serious rape and violence--only to find, to his horror that ""He's just a kid. Just a f--g kid!"" The look on the soldier's face as he stared close-up at the face of the dying child-soldier he's just stabbed: that will stay with me forever. Related scenes in Blood Diamond I already have a problem recalling. But what I do remember about it are all scenes involving 'Danny Archer'--which tells me something about the caliber of the actor who represented him.

Here we have the difference between bad and good story-telling. But, of course, Tears of the Sun was a flick about US soldiers having a conscience and one with Bruce Willis at that. So it can't possibly have been as 'important' and was probably pure US Navy propaganda. Right? Never mind that it asked more questions per average minute of film than Blood Diamond asked in an hour. It's just that they weren't shoved into your face with a ""Look here! Important stuff coming up!""

Still, ignoring the gratuitous proselytizing, this was a damn good movie--and thanks to DiCaprio for making it that way.",1170806400,,3986,4.931445603576751

The movie belongs to Leonardo DiCaprio. Many people were surprised when he got nominated for this film instead of The Departed. I'm not. He's equally good in The Departed but Blood Diamond just wouldn't have been the same with any other actor.

650905,4,6303365752,"It is 1990, and we are dropped into the strife of civil war and anarchy in Sierra Leone, West Africa. Many of the events depicted in this film were historically accurate. The RUF was a rebel group who viciously roamed the countryside killing civilians and government troops randomly, and they did amputate thousands of hands, and kidnap strong men to work in the diamond fields, and young boys to be conditioned into ""child soldiers"", drugged-out killing machines. Several factions competed for ""conflict diamonds"" that could be smuggled into neighboring Nigeria and sold in order to buy more weapons and bankroll more revolution.

The film was directed by Edward Zwick, a mainstream mover and shaker who specializes in synchronizing real historical events with dramatic action and human nature -as many of his previous films are testament to. In BLOOD DIAMOND, there is a tremendous sense of place, of being there in Africa; much more so than say THE CONSTANT GARDENER (2005). Charles Leavitt wrote the screenplay and it hummed with authority, bathos, profanity, loyalty, and hue and cry for human rights. As a film, this DIAMOND would have stayed in the rough without his intelligent and powerful dialogue. The stunning cinematography was done by Eduardo Serra, and his images shifted from sun-kissed savannas to deeply forested steaming jungles, from ghetto squalor to serene country lanes -always ready to share a vista or come in close on a character's face.

Leonardo DiCaprio has made some kind of artistic breakthrough, some powerful transition in this last year. He emerges as a powerhouse. He has been on the ""A"" list for a decade, and finally he deserves it. His Danny Archer is sporting several pounds of muscle and an authentic-sounding African accent. His soldier of fortune who happens to be a smuggler is painted in tiny strokes of brilliance. He nailed this character. By the end of the film we care a lot about him. Russell Crowe was considered for the part, but I am glad DiCaprio got it.

As good as Leo was in the movie, the film belongs to Djimon Housou as Solomon Vandy, a simple loving husband and Mende fisherman, his personal tragedy and strong sense of survival were beyond pivotal to the plot. If Archer was the intellect of the film, and the cunning, Vandy was its beating heart. Housou shows an impressive range as an actor, moving from parental tenderness to homicidal rage, from kidnapped slave to a free man, from forced civility to unencumbered visceral torrents of resistance. He is nominated for an Oscar, and he deserves it.

The rest of the cast is excellent as well. Jennifer Connelly as Maddy Bowen, the photo-journalist, was very effective; barely tapping her range as an actress, never the less, she shined in a part a lesser artist would have phoned in a performance for. Arnold Vosloo, always great, was cryptic and ruthless as Colonel Boetzee. Young Kargisdo Kuypers was a stand out as the son, Dia Vandy. Michael Sheen was quietly creepy and efficient as the businessman front for the Van De Kaap Corporation.

Archer: Sometimes I wonder if God will forgive us for what we've done to each other. But then I look around and realize God left this place long ago.",1170720000,,3206,4.8968692449355435
650906,4,6303365752,"`Blood Diamond' is an excellent adventure.  Skillfully intersecting the lives of three key figures, we get more than a soap box lecture from the liberal left.  Hardly preachy, the movie has natural developments and dialogue that are organic to the story and its delivery.  Some of the heart-stopping violence and the tender timeouts are testaments to fine timing and storytelling.  Meaningful throughout, we witness how greed and violence scar the lives and landscape of developing Africa.  However, the film would be a worthy experience even if it didn't have a message.

Leonardo DiCaprio plays a jaundiced diamond bounty hunter, Danny Archer, mentored by the military prowess of a commanding colonel since his late teens.  Despite the fact that his longevity should earn him fringe benefits, he gets an assignment meant to patch up a recently botched effort.  To get what he wants, he crosses the path of refugee, Solomon Venge (Djimon Hounsou), who is trying to reunite his family after sectarian violence has split them apart.  Solomon has found and hidden a huge rough diamond in the middle of his forced labor at a rebel camp, which Archer could use as the payback acquisition.  In the middle is liberal reporter, Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connolly), who wants to make a difference in the region more than win a Pulizer Prize.  Archer meets her and finds she can assist him with reuniting Solomon's family.  For her part, she needs the inside scoop of the black market diamond trade.  She knows about greedy agents, like Archer, are trading arms for diamonds to fund the rebels' side of the civil war, but she needs proof.  It's a complex, yet captivating trade.  In between these developments, we see Solomon's own son being indoctrinated and taught (among many) to fight with submachine guns for the rebel forces.

`Blood Diamond' may not always surprise, but it is filled with riveting adventure and harrowing battle scenes.  Urgent situations, anguishing details, and a connected plot construct a solid movie experience.  Pointedly, the film is meaningful.  The movie makes expert connections from the battles to the diamond trade to the jewelry store.  It also aligns the characters well.  In one emotional scene Archer and Bowen talk about his past, and we discover that he was made an orphan at an early age after civil war atrocities killed his parents.  Sometimes a few coincidences play too neatly into the hand of circumstance, but the exploitation and compelling chase scenes are presented genuinely enough.  DiCaprio's worthy Oscar nomination and fine supporting performances add to the cohesive story.  Even some of the cinematography is breathtaking enough to keep from taking the Third World for granted.  More than `Rambo' for liberals, `Blood Diamond' is a thoughtful and well-crafted movie experience with an important story to tell.",1170633600,,2855,5.127705627705628
650998,5,6303365752,"Leo is only in his early thirties and has the potential to be the best actor of his generation. The Departed and Blood Diamond offer two very different, yet brilliant performances by Leonardo DiCaprio (though I do think he deserved the Oscar nomination for The Departed). Djimon Hounsou is great as well and deserved the Oscar nomination he got for his role here. The movie itself is more than just an action film, providing some food for thought. It is also paced rather well. What else would you expect from the director who brought us Glory and The Last Samurai?",1170633600,,565,4.66
650999,5,6303365752,"A great action movie that attempts to reveal to the world the ugly side of the diamond trade and the human tragedy that was the civil war in Sierra Leone. The movie is based in Sierra Leone, though actually shot in South Africa and Mozambique.

It has great performances by Leonardo DiCaprio, particularly towards the end, and by Djimon Hounsou and Jennifer Connelly. I have no interest in diamonds whatsoever and have no view to express on their trade as a whole but it was very interesting to learn the long and complicated journey they can go sometimes, from the mine to the jewellery store. It was also very interesting to see how diamonds from this particular country possibly added to the woes of the long and bloody civil war it suffered. The chillingly ruthless rebels, the child soldiers, the routine use of limb amputation as a tool of terror. It's all here.

I also enjoyed the evolvement of the relationship between the DiCaprio and Hounsou characters. They come from completely different sides of the story and though they start off from a place of mutual distrust and disdain, they end up depending on each other through a whirlwind of violence and emotional upheaval. The tension runs through the entire movie. Props to director Edward Zwick. He's given us a very unlikely buddy movie with a difference. A very moving tale. Deserving Oscar nominations have, alongside a couple of technical ones, gone to DiCaprio for Best Actor and to Hounsou for Best Supporting Actor.

My only gripe is with the Sierra Leonean accents, which were the very definition of inauthenticity. I'm not from the country myself but I have friends who are and the accents made me wince. The subtitled indigenous language mainly spoken by Hounsou and the actors who played his family wasn't the problem - to be honest, I don't know if it was Mende, Temne or some other - it was the Krio (or broken English), spoken by most of the others like Captain Poison (played by the otherwise excellent David Harewood) and M'ed (played by Ntare Mwine). It was simply awful. How hard would it have been to get an expert dialect coach in or better still, to use Sierra Leonean actors? If they could get De Caprio's 'Rhodesia' accent to sound as convincing as it does, why not go all the way?

I guess it's a minor gripe though, all said and done. I still think it's a good movie and can't wait to get it on DVD.",1170460800,,2386,4.633569739952718
651000,5,6303365752,"Personally, I don't see the allure in diamonds and don't understand why anyone would purchase them, but that's just my view.  Blood Diamond definitely furthered that view and hopefully it changed the minds of a few greedy people that have fallen hook line and sinker for the DeBeers 3 months salary engagement ring garbage.

Now that my political statement is out of the way, on to the movie.

Blood Diamond is set in the context of Sierra Leone's civil war--with of course the diamond trade being the central theme.  It shows how the diamond trade has affected the life of one man and his family and how a diamond smuggler works this system for his own adventure and the monetary gain of others.  Their paths intertwine, along with a crusading journalist, and we have an exciting movie full of scenes showing us how ridiculous we all must be to covet such a silly little rock.  Sorry, can't keep my disgust for the diamond out of this review.  Anyway, see the movie and decide for yourself.",1170028800,,991,4.628571428571429

I am always leary about watching this kind of film, thinking it may just be some hollywood producer with a politcal chip on their shoulders, but this movie is really well done and the performances are great. Leonardo Decaprio does well and deserves his Oscar Nomination, but his performance is Honestly dwarfed by Djimon Hounsou, who in my book steal the show and of the two of them will be the one holding the statue at the end of the day.  The movie is very graphic and violent, so be forwarned.  Definite movie to see. unfortunately, I don't know if even a penny from seeing it will go to remedy the situation it was written about, thats the only drawback I see, but it will make most think more than twice before looking at a Diamond and its credentials.",1169856000,,883,4.50625
651002,4,6303365752,"I remember a candy bar commercial that left a lasting impact on me.  In this commercial there is a man who is in dire need of a Kit-Kat Bar.  He rushes to the local convenience store and see's that, to his great delight, there is only one more Kit-Kat Bar in the box, and it's all his.  Once the man leaves the store the lady at the cashier pulls another Kit-Kat Bar out of a box full of Kit-Kat Bars, and another man rushes into the store feeling as lucky as the previous man felt.  The lesson, I assumed, was that those who control the flow of supplies controls other peoples emotions.  Diamonds are sold much in this same way, where diamond companies sit on thousands upon thousands of diamonds a year, releasing very few to the general public so that they can overcharge for their beautiful little stones.

Despite the overflow of diamonds out there, many diamonds that are sold in stores are known as either conflict diamonds or blood diamonds, which are diamonds that were bought from terrorists or other people who cause great suffering to get the diamonds.  ""Blood Diamond"" takes place during a civil war in Sierra Leone, where a group of revolutionaries known as the RUF have just invaded a small village of families.  There they raped the women, killed the men, and took the children with them to train them to be revolutionaries too.  One man that is spared is Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), a fisherman who's family is taken to a special prison, and who's son is being trained to be the next general of the FUS.  Solomon is forced to fish a river for diamond stones, where he finds the biggest diamond ever seen by man.

Through a series of events that can only be classified as ""way too close for comfort,"" Solomon buries the diamond but now has a living nuisance in the form of Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a diamond smuggler who has heard about Solomon's diamond, and now wants it for himself.  Solomon wants nothing more then to save his family but lacks the connections to save them.  Danny has the connections to save Solomon's family, but only see's the effort worthwhile if Solomon will lead him to the place where the diamond is buried.  Solomon goes along with Danny but both men are joined by Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), a frustrated journalist who wants to inspire change but doesn't know where to start.  She figures if she can learn about how diamonds are smuggled she can take a good first step, which is why she is particularly interested in Danny's form of work.

As for the FUS...well, they cause the most trouble.  In almost every scene they are in the FUS shoot guns and kill as many people as possible, in action sequences that contain blood adrenaline thrills while still containing much human tragedy.  Most action movies about tough material skates a fine line between filming fast paced action sequences while trying not to exploit a terrible situation.  In most movies the human feelings are besides the point.  In ""Blood Diamond"" though the story is much closer to home then most action movies will go, and therefore it would be suicide if movie tried to ignore the human dilemma in the situations.  The movie doesn't ignore the human emotions though, which leads for a more fulfilling action movie then you usually see.  Also worth noting is the excellent acting.  Leonardo DiCaprio shows that he's come a long way since he made ""Romeo & Juliet"" and ""The Beach.""

Sporting a very convincing Australian accent, DiCaprio not only sounds like a native from Africa, but his accent is consistent.  He manages to go through many different emotions and feelings without ever breaking character.  This is worth noting.  It's also worth noting that DiCaprio's performance is really the only performance there is to critique in the first place.  All the actors are so convincing in this movie that I forgot anyone was even acting in the first place.  The only reason I knew DiCaprio was acting is because his accent is present.  Otherwise though, the acting is so solid there's almost nothing to say about it.

If there was a weak point to the acting, I would have to say it was Jennifer Connelly's performance as Maddy.  While Connelly doesn't do a horrible acting job for this part, the character itself feels a little artificial.  Yes, the beautiful reporter falls in love with DiCaprio's character, but admist all the chaos in this movie, I can't exactly pinpoint exactly where they would really have time to fall in love with each other.  The first time the two have a serious conversation about anything, Danny tells her about his childhood and how his parents died.  We see sympathy in her eyes, but anyone would fell this way after hearing a story about how ones parents died.  This does not equal romance, but the director runs with it anyway, probably knowing that if he didn't run with it the romance would seem extremely false and fake.

The movie ends with a warning to people who buy diamonds to make sure that the diamonds you buy are not conflict diamonds.  I wonder how the consumer is supposed to know what constitutes for a conflict diamond and what doesn't, but I guess my job isn't to laminate on that too much in this review.  I don't even want to laminate on the politics of this film too much as I don't think they add up to much in the end.  What I want to laminate on is the excellent acting, spectacular action sequences, and heartbreaking ending.  Hey, I AM watching a movie as opposed to a documentary!  I think laminating on these things is worth doing after you see a good movie.  And ""Blood Diamond"" is a great movie.

It is a brilliant movie. The best of 2006.

It has a very serious subject. Leo gives an amazing performance. I was shocked by this movie - it opens your eyes of what is happening in Africa (I cried a lot).

I am very proud of Leo that he did this movie. I wished this movie would be more recognized by the public and critics.

It is sad that that it is not nominated for best picture at the oscars. But I am so happy that Leo got nominated. He is breathtaking. My friend who saw the movie with me, lived in Africa for 6 years. She said that Leo's accent was totally correct for a white african person (people who are critizing him about the accent, they have no idea). She said, nobody could have done it better.

It is a really important movie (not just an action movie).

My friend and I think that this movie should be shown also in schools (for older students), because it shows the real world.

651005,5,6303365752,"Disclaimer first: if you are cheching this review for summary of script, you've come to the wrong place. I deal in impressions, not story-revealing.

I saw it at opening evening, and it was a premiere sponsored by UNICEF. So the movie began with a long advertisement for UNICEF and UNHCR. Which is ridiculous, cuz if you have ever been to any of the conflict zones you KNOW that:

1) UN staff mainly just take care of their safety and collection of danger pay

2) UN staff (mission personnel and military involved in ""peace keeping missions"") are known for all sorts of misbehavior, from smuggling to raping children.

Now that we have put that aside, let's go to the movie:

First think that stroke me was the realism of the movie. Thanks to the multifaceted story, brilliant acting and excellent camera/ editing.

The movie sucks you right in. I was jumping in the seat moaning ""run run!!"", I cried several times in the movie, I was shocked to see what happens in this ""civilized"" world we live in, I was embarassed to be complaining about ""a bad day at work"" or ""dissatisfaction with life in general"" I sometimes feel, I was happy to be born NOT in Africa (thou some might think Croatia is not THAT much better), I made a decision NEVER to buy another diamond, I was appaled at world business and all value being lost and forgotten apart from $$$.

And that was one of the aims of this film, to make us reflect and adjust our behavior, and do our little thing to make world a better place.

To this point, Connely says to DiCaprio ""good things are done every day. just not by you"". In the end, they both do good things. So can all of us.

Kudos to casting director in this film. Thou I don't really like DiCaprio, he IS an excellent actor and he proves it from one movie to the next. In this one, his ""Rhodesian"" accent, the whole role of white boy in Africa /traumatized mercenary was compelling.

Connelly in one of her better performances.

Last but not least, Hounsou and Vosloo (oh he ages so good!).

Cannot praise this film enough.

The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire film but it does deal with disturbing subject matter which is not for everyone. After watching this movie, i realized that although the Departed is an excellent movie, Blood Diamond is more emotionally-connected and intriguing which is why im happy Leonardo DiCaprio got his Oscar nom for this film.

 its really too bad that it wasn't as successful as it should be. the film was not promoted very well and was released in only 1920 theatres when most expected blockbusters are released in well over 3000. i feel the warner bros didn't put much effort into the promotion of ""Blood Diamond"" other then an appearance on Oprah, which is not the target demographic for the film.

Hopefully the film will be successful at the Oscars and then maybe Warner Bros will re-release it to capitalize on the moment. If you haven't already seen Blood Diamond, i suggest spending the 8-10 bucks and experiencing the film in a theatre.",1169510400,,1106,4.690721649484536

651078,4,6303365752,"Plot: The movie is set in the late 1990's in war torn Sierra Leone.  Danny Archer (Leo Dicaprio) is a diamond smuggler and mercenary looking to make it big.  That chance arrives when he meets Solomon Varday (Djimon Hounsou).  Solomon is a fisherman looking to make a better life for his family especially his son who he wants to go to school and become a doctor.  Danny learns that Solomon has found and hidden a large rare diamond. With the help of Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), an American journalist they go searching through the worn torn country run by rebels to find the hidden diamond.

What is good about it:
Africa is a magical place and this film shows it beautifully with sweeps of the green lush country, with elephants and other animals roaming, green hills and dense forest.  This backdrop is marred by the brutal violence that characters inflict upon another in the movie.  Blood diamond is very intense and the scenes of brutal violence amidst the backdrop of a gorgeous beautiful country are shocking and emotional. The movie isn't just about how a people are being exploited but how a country, a continent is falling apart.  It isn't just the world who demands precious resources, like diamonds, that is destroying this country but its very own people are killing each and fighting each other.

This movie doesn't flinch from horrors of war, including child soldiers and slavery.  By having Archer and Solomon, two very different African men, come together you are shown all sides of Africa.  That is impressive to do in one film and I believe that the film does accomplish its goal of showing all the facets of Africa.

What is bad about it:
There are just some scenes that went on too long.  Archer is a mercenary he only cares about himself.  Yet the makers of this movie are determined to allow him his redemptive moment.  I don't think that it adds anything to the plot.  The same with the ""romance"" between Archer and Maddy, it was extraneous and I think it takes away from the movie.  There could have been better editing which would have made the movie have a greater impact and get its point across without having these unnecessary scenes.

Conclusion:
This movie isn't just about Sierra Leone and the diamond trade this movie is about Africa and its twisted history, its terrible beauty and the nature of man.  This is a great film.  Yes it does drag in parts and has some formulaic scenes (thus the 4 and not 5 stars) but it is also well done.  The film sets out to elicit a certain response - horror at the nature of man, awe for the beauty of Africa and shame for knowing that these conflicts are happening and maybe we are contributing to them by our lack action.

As said by characters in the movie, it's T.I.A.  It's all about survival & generally, people need to be ruthless to get through yet another day. Once again, Edward Zwick, the Director who has brought us Glory, Legends of the Fall, the Last Samurai brings us a very emotive movie that strikes all the right chords without becoming cliche oversentimental.  He's helped a great deal by depths of actors & actress such as DiCaprio, Hounsou, & Connelly. Everyone has their own agendas and as we gradually dig beneath the surface, we find humanity that lurks within.  There is vulnerable time where DiCaprio's character, Archer cracks & he divulges to audience what makes him the person that he is.  And so does Connelly's character of why she risks it all when she can lead an ordinary life.  Hounsou's character is more straight-forward, where he would do anything to get his family back.  Overall, the movie is very powerful & well-done.  Despite different movies that Edward makes, one can't help but seeing similarity in themes that he's exploring.  In Glory, there's Denzel Washington who's all proud & full of honour. In Samurai, there's Tom Cruise's character who can't face himself for catastrophe that he wrecks upon innocent Indians, & in Legends of the Fall, there's Brad Pitt who runs away because he feels he has failed his brother who perishes in the World War.  In this instance, there's DiCaprio who feels the shoes.  In the end, the main characters redeem themselves by doing deeds that put everything right.  James Newton Howard who provides soundtrack for King Kong does a marvellous here too.  Overall, this is a tour-de-force that keeps audience like myself thinking & something to be seen on the big screen.

651080,3,6303365752,"Irrespective of what other critics/users say about this movie, I feel it lacked something. A lot of people have praised Di Caprio on his performance and some have has gone as far as saying this is his best performance, if not best film. I don't think Blood Diamond stacks up pretty well when you compare it to the last three films that Di Caprio has done. Namely - The Departed, Aviator and Catch Me If You Can. Now, let's talk about why I think this film fails.

1. The story never really convinces one of it's message. My friend loved this movie but I just didn't feel it. The acting in the film was solid but the direction was rather tawdry. There were many action scenes that involved thrill in chase, capture, imprisonment, punishment, labor and death. However, nothing quite seemed to cement itself.

2. Blood Diamond is a good film but it's just that. I don't think I will be recommending it to anyone. There are too many better films to watch. The subject is rather rewinded or should I just placidly state that I don't care. Or the script really doesn't make me care enough.

3. I liked the end of the film. I'm used to absolutely loving the ends of film involving Di Caprio. Jennifer Connelly didn't act very well. Her character was sometimes incongruent to the script. The fact that I even question her performance is enough to highlight the lukewarm performance she gave.

My favourite scene in the film involved Solomon winning an applause. But then, tell me, how many times have I seen scenes like that particular one in hollywood? Cynical as I am, I thought Djimon Hounsou acted very well. Di Caprio's character was predictable, at times funny and overall unimpressionable.

Do Watch this film. But be open to the fact that some of you might not quite like it all that much. Of course I eagerly await Caprio's next film, Blink.",1168819200,,1842,4.586626139817629
651081,4,6303365752,"Set in 1999 in the war-torn African country of Sierra Leone, Blood Diamond delivers an adventurous, action-packed, and tragic tale of what people will do for the most expensive rock on the planet, the diamond.

Directed by Edward Zwick (The Last Samurai), and starring Leonardo Dicaprio (The Departed), Dijimon Hounsou (Amistad), and Jennifer Connelly (A Beautiful Mind), Blood Diamond is a satisfying but flawed thought-provoking film.

The story revolves around three characters, the Souith African ex-soldier turned diamond smuggler Danny Archer, played with flair by Dicaprio, the African fisherman turned diamond miner Solomon Vandy, played brilliantly by Hounsou, and the TV reporter who is looking for a killer story about blood diamonds Maddy Bowen, played by Connelly. While mining for diamonds under force of the Armed Forces, Vandu finds a 10-carat diamond, buries it, and is captured and thrown in prison. In the meantime, rebels attack the village where his family live kidnapping his son Dia in the process and turning him into a child soldier. Archer knows he found the diamond he's been looking for and makes a deal with Vandy that if he helps him find it, he will get his family back and split the amount between the both of them. He also makes a deal with Maddy that if she helps the two men get to their destination, she can write the story she's been longing for.

Blood Diamond isn't the best film of the year, but it has good performances of the cast, especially Dicaprio and Hounsou who could end up with Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively, and an insight into a world of sadistic violence and treachery with an ending result of diamonds on people's fingers, which could turn people away from the traditional marriage proposals!

651082,3,6303365752,"""In America, it's Bling-bling. Out here it's Bling-bang."" One of the more clever lines uttered by Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) when aiming to summarize Sierra Leone's 1999 blood diamond situation to American photojournalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly). Archer is a diamond smuggler who demands your attention when on the screen, but then this feeling quickly dissipates due to a thick Zimbabwean accent that garble lines like a trash compactor. Bowen is the let's-save-the-world type of gal (always looking fresh) who wants proof that diamonds are being used to fund the attempted overthrow of the government by the rebel group Revolutionary United Front (RUF). In the middle of these two is Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), a fisherman who is being helped by both Archer and Bowen for quite different reasons.

The horror and conflict of Blood Diamond begins immediately during the movie's opening; the RUF invades Vandy's small village and quickly begins to amputate limbs with a machete (RUF's signature tactic throughout the 1991-2002 conflict). Vandy's son, Dia (Kagiso Kuypers) is kidnapped by the RUF to become a child soldier while the rest of the family, except Vandy, manages to flee to safety. Vandy is about to have his arm severed when Captain Poison (David Harewood plays the menace superbly) sees the towering man of muscle as a perfect candidate to mine the diamond fields.

Vandy finds a clear 100-carat pink diamond. He manages to bury it, but not without the ever watchful eye (bad pun for those who saw the movie) of the Captain lurking nearby. Cue the government forces to ambush the RUF and their mine; hence the pink diamond is still buried while Vandy and Captain are run off to prison. And lookie here, guess who is also in the same prison for trying to smuggle diamonds from Sierra Leone to Liberia? Yep, Mr. Archer, who also happens to overhear a loud argument between the Captain and Vandy about the rare gem. So the race is on. The Captain wants the pink diamond, so does Archer, but so does a South African group that Archer has worked for in the past. Vandy just wants to reunite his family while Bowen wants to write the story that will illustrate diamonds being sold aboard may have blood on them.

There are three problems with this film: dialog, dialog, and dialog. All the stars are actually quite emotive despite their lines; Djimon Hounsou has the least amount of lines and sparkles the most on the screen. The cinematography is often stunning, especially the long shots that claim to be Sierra Leone's countryside. The action scenes, although overdone at times to the point of trivializing the true bloody story of Sierra Leone's civil war, are captivating. However, the viewer is constantly yanked back to the reality of watching a movie instead of being immersed within the picture due to the movie lines being clunky and clich. In terms of the plot, there are not many surprises. In fact, the surprise is how many coincidences do occur in order for the plot line to move forward (deus ex machina in hyper-drive). For example, Vandy reaches the refugee camp (about a million people) and immediately spots his daughter and wife walking behind the fence.

Hollywood should be applauded for a film that spotlights the issues surrounding a conflict diamond, but Blood Diamond is more of a long infomercial or boring political speech than what it could have been: an informative but entertaining flick about an ugly period of history.

651083,3,6303365752,"Africa is the issue du jour in Hollywood these days, and director Edward Zwick's ""Blood Diamond"" is the latest attempt to shed light on the continent's genocidal civil wars.

Along with the brutal, borderline-racist ""Black Hawk Down,"" the film is the goriest on a list that includes ""Hotel Rwanda,"" ""Sometimes In April,"" ""Lord of War,"" ""The Interpreter,"" ""The Constant Gardener"" and ""Catch A Fire."" Zwick's production certainly is the longest; it's hard to get tired of Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou, two fierce actors in excellent performances, but ""Blood Diamond"" drives you right to the brink of tedium.

Charles Leavitt's plot-heavy screenplay zeroes in on Sierra Leone's 1999 civil war with little political detail. What we're shown is an overwhelmed puppet government against the rebels of R.U.F sadists who listen to Ice-T and Tupac as they shoot villagers from flatbed Toyotas and kidnap boys to become part of their war machine.

Fisherman Solomon Vandy (Hounsou) is one such villager separated from his family and sent to a diamond pit to panhandle for gems, which are used by the rebels to pay gunrunners for weapons. He finds a 100-carat pink doozy and hides it in the red dirt.

Diamond smuggler Danny Archer (DiCaprio, with a semi-consistent accent) hears of Solomon's diamond and makes a play to become his partner in relocating and selling the diamond to legitimate outfits in London, which launder the dirty diamonds, have them cut in India, then sell them, just like any other diamond, in the open market.

Archer, a self-described ""soldier of fortune,"" is weary of this arrangement and willing to sell his story to an American political journalist named Maddy (Jennifer Connelly) after he snatches the gem.

At its core, ""Blood Diamond"" is really an ""Adventure In The Bush!"" as Danny, Maddy and Solomon run, hide, con, bribe and kill their way back to the location of the diamond. There are three significant action sequences, all well done, all convincingly played by the actors. Archer in particular is no saint - he can crack a joke one breath, crack a skull the next - and DiCaprio gives the role the right kind of suave menace. He's a rough dude, ruthless to the last. We just happen to be rooting for him.

Solomon, of course, is a near-saint as the poor, humble African looking for his family - the written character is a walking cliche - but Hounsou doesn't let the performance wander into self-pity. Screenwriter Leavitt at least addresses Solomon's servitude posture to Archer in a fight sequence that, again, is a clich but at least dissolves the gnawing sense that Hounsou is sidekick to DiCaprio's Lone Smuggler.

Zwick may not be a household name, but since he directed ""Glory"" in 1989, he's made a pile of cash - he produced ""Shakespeare In Love"" and the television show ""thirtysomething"" - and used it for costly, epic shoots. He took two years and $140 million to make Tom Cruise's bloated ""The Last Samurai.""

Unlike the Cruise vehicle, which at least worked as a documentary-style look at the Japanese samurai culture, ""Blood Diamond"" is late to the topical party. Conflict diamonds may be the focus, but the exploitation and genocide of Africa is still the subject, and Zwick is more intrigued by African sunrises, rocket explosions and how many cigarettes DiCaprio can smoke. It entrenches itself in the ground level of the conflict, useful for sympathetic purposes but not so much for edification.

Are the conflicts of Africa about capitalist greed and men looking for their families? Yes. But it has to be about more than that.

I have yet to see ""The Last King of Scotland,"" but that story, about the rise and fall of Ugandan leader Idi Amin, and the exhaustive, powerful retelling of the Rwandan civil war found in ""Sometimes In April,"" seem the more essential stories now. Seek them out. Save ""Blood Diamond"" for a DiCaprio Saturday swoon-a-thon.",1168214400,,3899,4.937404580152672
651084,4,6303365752,"BLOOD DIAMOND wants to illustrate the tangled, multi-national, disgraceful state of ""Conflict Diamonds""...diamonds that are mined in war-torn countries, where countrymen are randomly killed or thrown in slavery, all over the desire by one warring faction or another to control the diamond trade.  They are supposed to be illegal in most of the world, but the movie reminds us that it's a pretty simple matter of paying a few bribes to the right folks after smuggling the diamonds to a ""legal"" country.  This is where the movie stumbles the most.  It's political messages are presented in little speeches peppered throughout the film, in a manner that stops the pace of the film.  One need only remember how well THE CONSTANST GARDNER wove similar subject matter into the very fabric of its being.  Take politics out of GARDNER and there'd have been no film left.  Take them out of BLOOD DIAMOND, and you'd have a rip-roaring action movie (and a MUCH smaller role for Jennifer Connelly).

Leonardo DiCaprio plays Danny Archer, an amoral diamond smuggler, pretty much willing to kill anyone who stands in his way (he was a mercenary, so knows his way around guns).  Djimon Hounsou is Solomon Vendy, a poor fisherman whose path crosses with DiCaprio when Solomon finds a rare, huge ""blood diamond"" and DiCaprio gets wind of it.  Solomon's son has been kidnapped by brutal rebels, and his only interest is to get his son back.  DiCaprio convinces Solomon he can help, but only agrees to do so if Solomon will lead him to the diamond.

Accompanying them on their journey is journalist Jennifer Connelly, who gets to spout much of the political rhetoric of the movie, especially early on.  The three travel through a brutal and violent landscape.  In many ways, the movie is like a Saturday-morning movie serial, moving from one close call to another...but it's all extremely violent.  Lots and lots of women and children callously cut down in the film.  We see children killing and being killed.

As I said, I found the political ""message"" to be less than compelling as drama.  But the drama of the movie...the action, if you will, is well staged and makes up for much of the rest.  Edward Zwick, who did such a great job with GLORY and a pretty good job, I thought, with THE LAST SAMURAI, is clearly aiming for an ""important"" film here...but in the end it's a violent, gory, terrifying, exciting action film.  I don't mean to dismiss the plight of the people in Africa.  It IS very disturbing to be aware of what's going on...and that's good.  However, as filmmaking, the filmmakers didn't quite work out how to dramatize the message.

I would say the script probably failed them.  The editing, cinematography, landscapes and especially the actors and the ACTION are all first-rate.  But the words the actors have to spout are often wince-inducingly non-human.

DiCaprio is all the way back now as one of our great actors.  After TITANIC, he briefly fell into the role of hard-partying idiot and somewhat fell out of favor.  He returned to serious filmwork in GANGS OF NEW YORK, but was overshadowed by Daniel Day-Lewis.  CATCH ME IF YOU CAN was more successful for him, but his acting chops were somewhat dismissed due to the frivolous nature of the film.  THE AVIATOR got him an Oscar nod, but somehow the public didn't really embrace it.  But this year, with THE DEPARTED and BLOOD DIAMOND, there is no doubting anymore that he is an actor of considerable skill.  His spotty South African accent aside (it's one of the toughest accents to replicate...seriously), he is first rate.  He's really a bad guy with charm, and the fact that we feel mostly on his side through the film, even though he's killing people left and right, is a testament to his charm.

Jennifer Connelly, in a poorly written role, always looks great, and staring with roughly the middle of the film, her character begins to connect with the audience, and we start to like her.  Her final ""scene"" with DiCaprio would have been cloying in the hands of other performers, but they both pull it off.

And Djimon Hounsou is always a mighty presence.  He was great in AMISTAD, Oscar nominated for IN AMERICA, and truly in his element in BLOOD DIAMOND.  He's an African born actor, and in this film he's truly in his element.  He has a real sense of the pace and lifestyle of the region, and it comes across very well.  His role is written to make him a very saintly character, and again, in less able hands, might have been truly one-dimensional.  I wish more people were seeing this film, if only to see him.

So, overall I recommend the film.  It's never boring, though occasionally frustrating.  It is NOT for the kids, though. The violence is graphic, constant and inflicted on truly innocent people.  But if you want adult entertainment with lots of action and don't mind a sheen of ""message,"" you'll be pleased.",1167955200,,4880,4.744655581947743
651085,4,6303365752,"""Blood Diamond"" may well result in the biggest boon yet for the cubic zirconium business.  This latest work by Edward Zwick tackles a serious social issue in the guise of popular entertainment, which turns out to be both the greatest weakness and the greatest strength of the film.

""Blood"" diamonds, also known as ""conflict"" diamonds, are those that are mined in war zones, then sold to finance those wars.  Set in 1999, the movie features Leonardo DiCaprio as a largely amoral diamond smuggler who is plying his trade in war-torn Sierra Leone on the west coast of the African continent.  Through a series of complicated events, Danny Archer meets up with a native named Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) who knows the whereabouts of a rare, priceless diamond that Archer, along with virtually everybody else in the film, would love to get his hands on.  Solomon, however, needs its as a bargaining chip to ransom his wife and children who have been turned into refugees as a result of the internecine war occurring between the government and rebel forces out to enslave people like Solomon in the local mines.  Jennifer Connelly plays a compassionate American reporter determined to expose the evil and corruption involved in the blood diamond business to a largely apathetic and hitherto unresponsive world at large.

With a screenplay by Charles Leavitt, based on a story by him and C. Gaby Mitchell, Zwick has fashioned a generally powerful film whose occasional dramatic contrivances can be easily forgiven in light of the salutary goal of the film.  One could object to the fact that, yet again, a story set in the Third World seemingly needs to be told through the eyes of white people from the West.  The movie tries to overcome this handicap by making it clear that Archer is actually from Zimbabwe - and DiCaprio has the South African accent to prove it - but the air of First World condescension is faintly evident nonetheless.  Still, given the sad fact that such an approach was probably necessary even to get the film green-lighted let alone funded, one cannot really hold that against the filmmakers.  The movie also indulges in a few too many action movie cliches - hairbreadth escapes, in-the-nick-of-time rescues, the near-miraculous dodging of bullets etc. - but, again, the moviemakers clearly know they must first get the attention of their target audience before they can enlighten them about the situation at hand.  Moreover, the film is a bit too long at 138 minutes and suffers from attenuation and repetition in its final half hour.

Those negatives aside, ""Blood Diamond"" is, for the most part, an effective piece of serious commercial moviemaking, thanks, primarily, to Zwick's skill as a director and to the fine performances by DiCaprio, Connelly and, especially, Hounsou, whose quiet dignity and fierce determination do much to personalize the plight of the innocents caught in a hellhole of wanton slaughter and crass de-humanization.  Perhaps the greatest strength of the movie is that it doesn't stint in showing us the brutality and widespread individual suffering brought about by this mad rush towards profit and greed.  In addition, Archer's slow awakening to the depths of the human tragedy occurring around him and his own shameful participation in it may be predictable from a narrative standpoint, but it gives the film the moral weight and thematic depth it needs to elevate it above the level of a mere exploitative action picture.",1167868800,,3473,5.015652173913043
651086,4,6303365752,"Leonardo DiCaprio has never been better. After The Aviator I came around to him. And though The Departed has sparked much praise, he here is able to evolve into a complex character and carry a film. He's the best part of this.
Edward Zwick makes me consider Ron Howard. Both are major studio directors, produce large films with A-list actors, play into popcorn cliches with precision and get credit for being able to handle drama and history as entertainment.
When something is going to happen in a film like Blood Diamond, I prefer to not be directed to my feelings. That's projecting, and it aggrivates me and draws be out of my previously sustained sense of willing disbelief. That happens much here.
I appreciate Zwick's intelligent handling of culture clashing characters, and recognize their socio-political significance. Certainly Glory is a classic histor-dramatic-war-epic and features great acting. Courage Under Fire again presented war-time chaos against racial and sexual politics within a historical reality. The Siege was over-hyped, despite being somewhat precient and not executed with as deft a writing and acting hand as The Last Samurai or even Blood Diamond. (Bruce Willis may be responsible for that.) The Last Samurai was a terrific story and again presented a culture clash that faded into genuine respect, affection, and finally self-sacrifice.
What I struggle with as a film lover though is a lack of trust in complexity. Africa as a continent is a chaotic place. It's conflicts are consistently brutal to an insane rate, and it's history-be it slavery, imperialism, colonialism, religion, and/or racism (if you will)- are so common that they get publisized between the weather and sports on CNN.
Djimon Hounsou and Jennifer Connelly, as the semi-leads are good. I've liked them in many other films. Here they get short shrift. Hounsou's Solomon is too simple. Too foolish. Too unaware. Too myiopic. Connelly's Maddy, true-hearted journalist, is standard. Her beauty becomes distracting when her place in the story becomes truth and idealism.
DiCaprio takes the film to where it needs to go though in it's gritty scenes. Because the dramatically scored or politically preachy parts are superfluous. Two examples are the scene when he is walking down the alley way with Coetzee's right hand man, who has just ransaked his apartment, and after spending the night in the brush he threatens Solomon as he describes baboons. Was there music scored under those scenes to guide my subconscious? I don't remember. There was an intensity though, and that drew me in.
Blood Diamond works as a partial character study of a mercenary and the ravages of Africa's chaos. It also works as a history and present day (Darfur anyone?) lesson of the role commerce and the wider world plays in Africa's travails.
I recommend this, but with some reservations.",1167696000,,2864,5.134903640256959
651087,4,6303365752,"An intense searing drama based on the stuff of real life, Blood Diamond is just as compelling and powerful now as it would have been at least 20 years ago or more--that's at least how long the rank corruption in the diamond trade has been going on (probably much, much longer than 20 years). From South Africa to Sierra Leone--the setting for this film--to Antwerp to your local high-priced jeweler, diamonds have been and still are gems born out of nightmares.

People kill for gold and do the same for diamonds. Here, in Sierra Leone--show to be just as potent a source for them as South Africa--children are brainwashed and taught to wield and shoot automatic weapons at anyone and everyone their commanding officer tells them to kill. Here we find Leonardo di Caprio, sporting a pitch-perfect South African accent, as Danny Archer, a diamond smuggler who ultimately lets his heart command him rather than his greed, and also Solomon Vandy, a Sierra Leone native (Djimon Hounsou in a great performance) whose son has been kidnapped by the bloodthirsty rebel militia and who himself finds a very large pink diamond, worth millions. And here we also find Maddie Bowen, an American female journalist played by Jennifer Connelly, whose own sense of humanity is tested in the face of horrendous events

While a lot of the above may sound cliched, the combination of outstanding performances (Di Caprio has by now come so far from both Gangs of New York and Titanic that it is truly remarkable) and the unrelentingly brutal violence of greed-based corrupted life essentially blows away the possibility of a trite piece of work. The director, Edward Zwick, has crafted a powerful film that hits home like very few other cinematic works this season.

In the film, the Van de Kaap diamond collective--all too obviously standing in for the De Boers organization (the largest diamond trading outfit in the world)--is shown to be totally complacent regarding the horrifying atrocities committed in the name of freedom but really centered on the lust for wealth diamonds represent.

While it is true that the ending does bleed into the melodramatic, the shocking reality of the truth of what has gone before dispels this. This is a film that everyone should see...and that should make you stop and think, if nothing else, before buying an engagement ring or any other diamond-based piece of jewelry.

Very highly recommended.",1167696000,,2415,4.967821782178218
651188,3,6303365752,"I think its clear that Blood Diamond is supposed to be a weighty, heart-felt, conscience film.  It is a very entertaining film, for the fairly straightforward story-line, but it turns into a slightly screeching, preachy, and slow moving vehicle for the obvious.  I thought the acting was excellent--I thought they did what the script asked of them.  I just think it was a bit overhyped (not the movie's fault).  I do think it was ""Hollywood-ized"", to soften it.  The violence in the movie was thankfully minimal, with respect to the actuality; however it seemed gratuitous, and frankly had no context.  The movie's themes were lazily delivered by the script, as opposed to circumstance.  Perhaps, what I blame most of all, was the audience, who I suspect, like most other audiences, frankly didn't appreciate the subltety of the unspoken and seemed shocked to have been confronted with this for the first time.  It frightens me that this movie will probably serve as a historical and factual anchor for a subject that goes much deeper.

Overall, with more than enthusiastic praise going to DiCaprio and Hansou, I've seen ""B movies"" that delivered much better.",1167004800,,1159,4.994791666666667
651189,4,6303365752,"What was happening in Sierra Leone circa 1999 was maddeningly ignored by the world at large, as warring factions fought for control of the country's lucrative diamond mines and the worldwide diamond monopoly exploitated and manipulated the situation to keep their grip on the market secure, at the cost of the country's stability and the lives of thousands of Africans.  Just ask Danny Archer (Leonardo Dicaprio).  Even though Archer is a fictional fortune hunter dashing arcoss Sierra Leone to cash in on the chaotic diamond trade, his revelations to crusading journalist Manny bowen (Jennifer Connelly) of greed and capitolism run amok are startling and they help lend moral resonance to a film that is otherwise a thrilling two and a half hour chase through the African bush.

Archer, an experienced oppurtunist, is desparate to escape Africa and he finds his shot when, imprisoned for diamond smuggling, he overhears fellow prisoner Solomon Vandy (Djimon Houson) being grilled by a wounded rebel general about the whereabouts of a large and rare pink diamond.  Archer breaks Vandy out of prison and the two (along with Connelly's Bowen) sprint around the countryside to find where Vandy stashed the diamond, a mutual argreement since Archer wants out of Africa and Vandy wants to reconnect with his vanished family.  Vandy, who is played with immense passion by Houson, is a fisherman who lost track of his family when his village was raided by rebel soldiers, including child soldiers brandishing AK-47's bought from the illicit diamond trade.  Vandy's wife and daughters escape to a refugee camp but his son is captured by rebel soldiers and indoctrinated into the army.  The brutal abuse and brainwashing of child soldiers and the violence inflicted on civilians by all warring factions is portrayed with unflinching and devastating realism by director Edward Zwick (The Last Samurai), whose vision of total war in Africa is augmented greatly by cinematographer Eduardo Serra (Girl with a Pearl Earring) and editor Steven Rosenblum, a Zwick favorite.  The images of Vandy's son killing rebel prisoners blindfolded, shooting heroin and giving in to the serpentine manipulation of his demented commander is heartbreaking, all a consequence of the continuing war that large Diamond corporations and monopolies have a stake in continuing and Archer has a stake in exploiting.

The film's themes and imagery haunt because of the superb acting from the trio of leads (Dicaprio, Connelly and Houson) that carry the entire film.  Dicaprio has the trickiest role of a rougish and amorous soldier of fortune willing to sell out anyone and anything to acheive his goals, and he tears into the role with a confidence and maturity that is worlds away from ""Titanic"" and even his early work with Martin Scorcese.  He's charismatic, cunning and lethal, and perhaps this constitutes the finest work he has ever done.  Connelly takes what would have been a throw-away part as a moralistic journalist and energizes it with undiluted moral anger and indignation, harboring no illusions to how hard exposing the story of blood diamonds and the beneficiaries will be.  Houson is pure power and passion as a father pushed to edge, who will trek through the hellish countryside of Sierra Leone to find his family.

""Blood Diamond"" is not an easy film to watch.  The violence is unrelenting and shattering and the amoral greed disheartening.  Even the most uplifting aspects of the film are haunted by the chance that something like Sierra Leone may very well happen again.  It is true that ""Blood Diamond"" is a dynamite chase film, and it is entertaining on that front, but it is the theme of global greed coldly manipulating nations and lives for profit and the imagery of savage total war and child soldiers that is impossible to shake.",1167004800,,3822,5.0896
651190,4,6303365752,"Director Edward Zwick in his perturbing portrayal of a 1999 civil war in Sierra Leone gives overdue exposure to both the problems of the recruitment of child soldiers and the procurement of conflict based diamonds.  Zwick might have toned down the numerous unsettling scenes of violence and still made his points very succinctly.  Filmed exclusively on the African continent, the environmental beauty pictured is marred by the ugliness of war and conflict.

Leonardo DiCaprio toting a well researched South African accent adroitly plays Rhodesian ex-mercenary and opportunist Danny Archer, who now makes his living smuggling diamonds.  While incarcerated he gets wind of the discovery of a rare massive pink hued diamond by African fisherman Solomon Vanty played superbly by Djimon Hounsou.  Honsou and his village had been obliterated by merciless, trigger happy rebel forces who captured him to slave at mining diamonds and his son as a recruit for their brainwashed army.  With his family scattered Hounsou allied with DiCaprio who obsessed for the pink diamond that Hounsou had hidden.

The stunning raven haired Jennifer Connelly played Maddy Bowen, an American journalist stationed in Sierra Leone attempting to write a story about the diamond cartel approved policy of purchasing blood diamonds.  Connelly who was to become DiCaprio's love interest played his voice of reason as she implored him to divulge the sensitive details of the illegal diamond trade.

DiCaprio and Hounsou go on a quest to both secure the hidden diamond and reunite Hounsou's family making their way through the dangerous mayhem of the civil war.  Although both are native Africans of vastly different backgrounds they manage to finally agree on an ethical course of action.",1166918400,,1756,5.329710144927536
651191,5,6303365752,"I am very proud of Mr. DiCaprio. He is amassing quite and impressive body of work both artistically and politically. He appears to be picking his movies and parts carefully. There have been a whole genre of political movies made within the last 4-5 yrs or so that have been doing a very good job of getting out global information to the public -- which is what the American media should be doing but somehow cannot or will not. ""Blood Diamond"" is one of those movies that hopefully will make you think and reconsider your purchasing habits and how something so simple can affect other people (especially children) half way around the world.

This movie is serious and worth seeing. It put me in a really bad mood, but also made me determined to monitor my purchasing habits so that I do not contribute to that vicious cycle which is war, greed and poverty.",1166659200,,856,4.558441558441558
651192,4,6303365752,"The critics are touting ""Blood Diamond,"" directed by Edward Zwick, as one of the best films of 2006 as well as lavishing praise on Leonardo DiCaprio for his performance as Danny Archer, diamond smuggler. The movie is certainly worth seeing. DiCaprio gives his best performance to date-- at least that I have seen-- as he usually suffers from what I call the Hugh Grant Syndrome, never able to be totally successful at playing a grownup. The outrageously beautiful African countryside is in sharp contrast to the unending bloody slaughter that takes place in Sierra Leone as families are either destroyed or left in abject poverty.

Although the plot is predictable, the film is ultimately saved by the fine acting. In addition to the performance of DiCaprio, Jennifer Connelly as Maddy Bowen, the journalist who makes a difference in Archer's life, is outstanding. Nevertheless, no one comes close to Djimon Hounsou as Solomon, the poor African who finds the pink diamond in the first place. His performance almost justifies paying the outrageous price these days of a first-run movie.",1166400000,,1085,5.095505617977528
651193,5,6303365752,"Blood Diamond has some of the finest performances I have seen.  It is a telling comment when an actor makes you forget that you are watching Leonardo DiCaprio or Djimon Hounsou and convinces you that you are watching an unscrupulous smuggler and a fisherman.  Probably the overwhelming number of films that I have seen will have a scene that stretches the truth, something less than credible that makes the story exciting but is beyond the realm of certainty.  Blood Diamond, on the other hand, comes over like a piece of good journalism and you feel as if you are watching events as they unfolded.

The story of the film has been nicely summarized by other reviewers.  It is, indeed, a story that has several layers one of them being the misery of modern Africa with its unstable governments and extreme poverty.  We see the immense piles of garbage that are the playgrounds for children and the enslavement of children by militias that turn them into child soldiers who are devoid of the simple delights of being children.  Greed is the overriding motive for Danny Archer, Solomon Vandy and Colonel Coetzee and Captain Poison.  Archer sees the diamond as his ticket out of Africa and Arnold Vosloo (and Captain Poison as well) for its fabulous wealth.  The sympathetic choice is Solomon because he not only found the stone (made a slave by the rebels and forced to pan for diamonds) but he would make a better life for his impoverished family.  On the other side of the diamond trade is journalist Maddy Bowen (played by Jennifer Connelly) who wants to expose the misery that Africans are forced to endure searching for diamonds and the cartel turns a blind eye toward.  She begins a relationship with Archer and appears to slowly change his feelings toward the diamond corporation he smuggles for from one of complicity to a willingness to let her expose them.

Director Edward Zwick (who also directed Glory and The Last Samurai) has produced another masterpiece of story telling.  The final scene is unforgettable as Solomon (the best performance I have seen Djimon Hounsou give), now reunited with his family in London, is about to tell his story before a commission investigating the diamond trade.  The film also makes a plea to us, the people who buy diamonds, to become responsible for discovering where the stone came from and if it could be a smuggled diamond.  This film will probably make you see diamonds in a new light and remind us that we can play a part to end the misery of how these gems are mined.",1166400000,,2519,4.732265446224257
651194,3,6303365752,"Leonardo DiCaprio, our best living actor, leads the charge in this strong, but flawed, offering from Edward Zwick. Pumping out his second Oscar worthy performance this season DiCaprio tries to turn a $100 million monstrosity from Warner Brothers into a political screed. It doesn't really work out that way as the blade on their political knife is so dull that it is rendered nearly useless. Instead we are left with great storytelling that will entertain its intended middle brow audience so much that they won't even remember the message by the time they leave the theater. Manohla Dargis made the clever point that DiCaprio's heartthrob status will get younger females, or the people that need to see this movie the most, into the theater. But you know what they say about leading a horse to water. Playing opposite DiCaprio we have the outmatched Jennifer Connelly who tried to get the native look down, it appears, by falling asleep in a tanning booth. Of course the two attractive white people find each other, amongst a sea of black, to discuss the Clinton scandal. The point is right on, however, as the American people are called out for their sick obsession over that while people in Sierra Leone are dying to feed their vanity. Soon Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) enters the fray as a man who knows the location of a very valuable pink diamond, and the hunt is on. Danny (DiCaprio) is after that diamond in the name of his billfold, Solomon is out to reunite his family who has been divided by the conflict, and Maddy is after the story that will expose the fictional diamond company for doing business with mercenaries. They stomp through the jungle, avoiding pickup trucks filled with machine gun wielding revolutionaries, moving ever so quickly toward the predictable ending.

At one point Maddy is asked if the bloodshed would stop if the information she is hunting for is ever found and presented to the American people and she replies, quite frankly, that it probably would not. That's us Americans, steadfastly believing that a few limbs is a small price to pay to make a rich princess feel a little bit more beautiful. Maddy comes off as idealistic next to the hardened Danny, but she has that luxury, and so do we. Danny needs that diamond to get away from the terrible life he has been leading, we don't NEED it for anything and thus have the luxury of not buying it.

Throughout the film I was thoroughly entertained. The ending is exactly what you might expect, but the path there is not. Solomon's love for his son becomes a major liability that complicates things on more than one occasion. Zwick does overdo the trick where a giant distraction (usually from the sky) saves the characters in the nick of time. He also uses cheap shots like the constant image of young kids holding big guns. But the reason behind it is pure and you can't expect a housewife to give up her love of diamonds AND children in one night. So despite its problems I am recommending this film, as an act of bravery on Warner Brothers part, as an act of genius on DiCaprio's part, and as an act of great storytelling on Zwick's part. ***1/2",1166313600,,3139,4.684782608695652
651195,5,6303365752,"You should know that, first and foremost, Blood Diamond is an action/adventure movie, complete with astounding escapes, chases, implausible coincidence, violence, and the like.  It is also very well done on that level, with Edward Zwick ably handling the pure adrenaline rush of the action.

But Zwick's film is also set in the context of the tragedy of conflict diamonds amidst civil war, and the horror seemingly endlessly perpetrated upon poor civilian populations by ""men with guns"", or in this instance, often ""children with guns"".

What can one say about the misery of so much of Africa?  So much of the world, really.  When confronted by the seeming contradictions of life in war torn Sierra Leone, discos and rap music and hand amputations and 10 year olds with AK-47's, one character's answer is ""TIA"" i.e. ""This is Africa"".

The diamond trade is not happy with this film, and I can see why.  The fact that the  monopoly controls the market so effectively to keep the price up, and the fact that such an easily tranportable wealth means keeping ""conflict diamonds"", the blood diamonds of the title, from supplying the arms for more violence over their control near impossible. When the journalist, played by Jennifer Connelly, says ""if people knew the cost of a diamond is an arm, they wouldn't buy them"" I wondered if that were so.

I think the sorrow of the film is heightened by the natural beauty of the place, filmed wonderfully.  The cast is fine.  Leonardo DeCaprio is very good here.  Djimon Housou brings an inherent dignity to his role, one that seems to be present in all his work.  Jennifer Connelly always embodies intelligence along with her beauty (and I don't know how she manages to get even better looking as time goes on, but she does).

A very fast and furious action film with a lot of other things on its mind, I found the film well worthwhile.",1166140800,,1875,4.746913580246914
651196,5,6303365752,"I have never been a `huge' fan of Leonardo DiCaprio. Something about every one of his performances seems so calculated and unnatural. Yes, I realize every actor is `acting', but DiCaprio always seems like he is acting and is unable to take it that extra step and make it more believable.

Watching first ""The Departed"" and now ""Blood Diamond"" has changed my conception of DiCaprio.

Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) works hard as a fisherman in his small village, trying to provide for his family and ensure his son, Dia (Kagiso Kuypers) goes to school. He wants his son to grow up and be a doctor. Walking his son home, Solomon notices a caravan of three vehicles overloaded with gun toting revolutionaries headed into his village. They immediately begin shooting and Solomon runs to his family, to protect them and get them to safety. But then he is caught. Instead of cutting his hands off, the leader of the revolutionary forces decides he would be better off working in the diamond mines. There, Solomon witnesses acts of brutality meant to keep any of the workers from stealing from the revolution. But Solomon finds a large pink diamond and realizes it will be worth a lot of money. He manages to hide it just before government forces invade and takes them all to jail. In jail, the commander starts yelling about Solomon's pink diamond and Danny Archer (DiCaprio), a diamond smuggler, believes the story. He soon makes Solomon his number one project and gets him released, trying to persuade him to give him the pink diamond. The more people who find out about it, the more their lives are in danger. In town, Danny meets Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), a journalist investigating conflict diamonds. She knows who Danny is and realizes he could be the break she needs for the story. He also recognizes how Maddy could help them. And Solomon realizes he can use the diamond to get his family back, provided they are still alive.

I have only grazed the surface of the story in Edward Zwick's (""Glory"", ""The Last Samurai"") new film ""Blood Diamond""; that rare thing in Hollywood, and exciting message film that actually teaches us about the events behind the story.

Zwick is a very good director. His films deal with complicated subjects in an exciting way, making them accessible to the masses of people who frequent multiplexes, but also illuminate these subjects, making them interesting to the same people who are taking a break from shopping at the Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch. Because he is able to deal with complicated subjects, and still make the characters interesting and the story accessible, his films are much better for it. People are more likely to retain information and knowledge if they are enjoying themselves or their interest is held. I can't say watching ""Blood Diamond"" is `fun', but it is well-made, exciting and holds your interest. One woman in the audience gasped audibly many times during the more shocking and graphic moments.

DiCaprio has had a very strong year. First, he portrayed undercover agent Billy Costigan in Marin Scorcese's ""The Departed"" and now he plays Rhodesian diamond smuggler Danny Archer. Danny is a complex character. He is out for himself, always, because he is number one. Everything he does in his life is designed to somehow help him. Every relationship, every word he speaks, every move he makes is calculated to somehow get him money or advance his career. He has a network of people who assist him, but he can't trust them and realizes the only reason they are involved in his life is because of money. Gradually, throughout the film, we learn a little bit about his life and his upbringing. Danny hasn't had an easy life and this information makes the character all the more interesting and intriguing.

The two people he meets over the course of the film are both pawns in his game to get more money. To a diamond smuggler, the very thought of a large pink diamond, the type Solomon has found, is too much. He simply can't pass up the chance to try and find it and make it his. He starts to manipulate Solomon into revealing the whereabouts of the hidden diamond.

But Solomon isn't stupid and recognizes Danny for what he is. As strong as DiCaprio is, Hounsou is better. From the first moments with his son, Hounsou shows us Solomon's dedication to his family. He loves them and every waking moment is spent providing for them and helping to make his children's life better. As soon as he sees the revolutionaries speeding towards his village, he knows he has to do something. Their presence will not be good news for the people. After he goes to work at the diamond mine, he witnesses how brutal these people are, yet, as soon as he finds the pink diamond, he has an opportunity and he takes it, realizing this rare stone could help him.

As soon as Danny enters his life, Solomon knows what he wants, despite what the man tells him. Initially reluctant, Solomon comes to realize he can use Danny to help him. Danny is so set upon his goal, that Solomon can use this determination to help him get closer and closer to the diamond.

Djimon Hounsou has been in some impressive films, but this performance is heads and shoulders above the rest. Every moment he just exudes the determination we feel in Solomon; his number one goal is to get his family back and will do anything to make that happen.

Jennifer Connelly is less interesting as Maddy Bowen. As a journalist, she makes it a practice to travel to conflict situations in foreign countries, and get to the root of the story. Other journalists make comments about her ability to get in and out of these dangerous places with nary a scratch. So it is not surprising that Danny finds her in this part of Africa, as a civil war rages. Because of this ability, she writes for some high profile magazines and newspapers, her voice is heard. The most interesting thing about her is that she is certainly no angel either.

As soon as she meets Danny, Maddy realizes he is the key to her new expose and needs the information he has to break the story wide open. She is willing to get that information at any cost. She helps Danny and Solomon, seduces Danny, uses her connections to get Solomon some help and more. Because she is willing to go to these lengths, her character is much more interesting. But in the end, Connelly has difficulty making this character anything more than a third wheel. So much of the story is about Danny and Solomon that Maddy is little more than a supporting character whenever she shows up.

""Diamond"" is filled with some terrific, exciting action scenes. Danny and Solomon are never allowed to rest for long and are frequently on the move, from Danny's former military commander, Colonel Coetzee (Arnold Vosloo, ""The Mummy"") and many other people, all of whom want that diamond to support their cause. Some of these scenes are so realistic looking it is amazing people weren't harmed during their filming.

But ""Diamond"" also wants to get its message across and Zwick manages this with ease. Through brief exchanges and short montages, we learn the path these diamonds take to retail shops, the efforts people take to get them from the mines and why they are so important to these various groups, what they end up funding and more. These moments are fully integrated into the story and are usually quite brief, it seems like every time two characters start talking they are interrupted by bullet fire or an ambush or some type of action. Because the story keeps moving, and we are kept on our toes, we are entertained by every aspect of the film. This is a much different approach than some other filmmakers use (Spike Lee and Oliver Stone, I'm looking at you...). Other filmmakers are more likely to compose a series of monologues for their characters, in an effort to get the message across, but in the end, their messages just sound preachy and we don't really learn anything from the film. In the end, it is much more effective to provide an entertaining message, which will help the audience retain what you are getting across. Believe me, many of the images and events of ""Blood Diamond"" are seared on my mind.

""Blood Diamond"" is a very good film, featuring great performances from DiCaprio and Hounsou (if he isn't nominated for an Oscar, the awards are meaningless) and presents an entertaining story with memorable facts about one of the less known problems in the world.",1166054400,,8428,4.712830957230143

It's a thriller, with a multifaceted plot and, of course, love interests on many levels; man and woman, man and family, father and son, people and country. It's grandiose, has beautiful photography. At first I thought it might have been filmed outside of LA. But, it was too beautiful, as Africa is, a paradise lost in war. It's deeply touching to see the power of love of a man for his son, and family. It's deeply moving, as much as any film I've ever seen. Yet, the subject matter is almost documentary about real life events that continue to this day, and as the writer eludes, parallel those of the blood for oil trades.

651270,5,6303365752,"""Blood Diamond"" is a film that exposes harsh truths, in effect forcing the audience to get a taste of someone else's unpleasant reality. Specifically, it focuses on the buying and selling of blood diamonds, which are mined in war zones and secretly sold in order to finance an insurgent's war efforts. A majority of the story takes place in Sierra Leone, a small African country that actually directed the world's attention to blood diamonds in the late 1990s. The country was immersed in an intense civil war at that time, fueled by a militant band of rebels called the Revolutionary United Front (RUF for short) and their attempts to overthrow the government. Funding their efforts was an illegal diamond trade, one that forced many innocent people into becoming workers.

This movie doesn't attempt to hide the brutality of that civil war; likewise, it doesn't spend long periods of time focusing on bloodshed. What it does is effectively tell a compelling human story that's just as touching as it is ugly. Taking place in 1999, the main character of the story is Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), a Sierra Leone native put to work in a diamond mine after the RUF destroys his village and forcefully separates him from his family. While digging up part of the riverbed, he finds a sizeable diamond chunk that has a slight pink tinge to it, something so rare and valuable that its sale could prolong the chaos. Solomon quickly decides to hide the diamond, burying it in a patch of land near the river.

When the government's legitimate military force raids the area, Solomon is arrested on suspicion of being part of the RUF. In jail, he crosses paths with Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a slick diamond smuggler with no regard for anyone's well being other than his own. He witnesses a shouting match between Solomon and an RUF soldier nicknamed Captain Poison (David Harwood), one that directly addresses the missing pink diamond. This peaks Archer's interest; he's looking for a way to finally leave Africa, a continent full of hatred, corruption, and despair, more so than even he can stand. He arranges for Solomon to be freed so that they may join forces, find the diamond, and save Solomon's family. Unfortunately, it's a dishonest union; Archer is merely using Solomon as a way to obtain the diamond. He has no feelings whatsoever for a refugee family.

At least, he initially doesn't. As the film progresses, some of Archer's layers peel away, gradually revealing a moral compass that isn't as off course as one might think. We come to see him as someone who's been hurt a few too many times, preventing him from pursuing an honest life. American journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is trying to reach that side of Archer in order to expose the atrocities occurring within Sierra Leone. In her own way, she's just as manipulative as Archer; she can't write about the corrupt diamond industry unless she has proof, and she can't get any proof without Archer's help. She needs him in order to write a good story. This is somewhat hypocritical when considering her disapproval over Solomon's treatment: ""I'm using him, and you're using me,"" says Archer, ""and that is the way it works.""

Unfortunately, there's truth to that statement, one of the many aforementioned harsh truths that are brought to light. It's refreshing for a film like ""Blood Diamond"" to present them, especially since it can offer a way to learn about something consumers take for granted. The three characters also have learning experiences, in one form or another. Archer probably has the greatest one; Solomon briefly reunites with his family at the fence of a refugee camp, only to learn that his young son, Dia (Kagiso Kuypers) has been taken by the RUF. While seeing this does little to diminish Archer's desire to possess the hidden diamond, that one moment of love and anguish still leaves an impression, one that enables a better understanding of Solomon's determination.

His desperate feelings are easy to understand from the audience's point of view, and they're completely validated in scenes involving Dia and Captain Poison. They're effectively uncomfortable to watch; the young boy is slowly being brainwashed into believing as the RUF do. Captain Poison immediately takes Dia under his wing in order to make him easier to manipulate. He and other children undergo rigorous training, most of which include the use of firearms. I distinctly remember one moment when Dia is blindfolded and handed a machine gun. He's then obeys the order to pull the trigger. When he removes the blindfold, he realizes that he killed a refugee purposely put in the line of fire.

There are many such moments in this film, all of which are unpleasant but nonetheless relevant. The violence and inhumanity is quick, raw, and ugly: many are shot dead; an RUF soldier severs the right hand of a young boy; Captain Poison injects Dia with some kind of drug, presumably heroine. They act as counterpoints to the belief that humans are inherently good at heart; Solomon believes that his son is still the good soul he was before he was captured. ""You'll be a doctor someday,"" he often said to young Dia, who would go to school everyday, even when he didn't quite feel up to it. There's a perfect balance at work here, informing the audience with a mixture of disturbing imagery and enlightening moments of compassion and understanding.

As Archer, Solomon, and Maddy continue their journey, this understanding grows deeper. The uncertainty grows, as well: Solomon may never reunite with his family; Archer may never find that precious diamond; Maddy's scoop on Sierra Leone's diamond trade may forever be unprinted; the RUF may continue to rule with an iron fist. How ironic that their motto was: ""No More Slaves, No More Masters. Power and Wealth to the People."" It makes one wonder whether or not they understood the power of their words, especially since they used them to encourage both acts of violence and undeserved loyalty. ""Blood Diamond"" does a wonderful job of examining this complex belief system, something that for many years was the reality for the people of Sierra Leone. I'm thankful for having seen this film; it's an eye-opening depiction of a real life crisis, one that a lot people have yet to learn about.",1165708800,,6304,4.913615023474178
651271,4,6303365752,"This movie is like Hotel Rwanda meets Titanic: It offers a vivid and stomach wrenching portrayal of a modern human atrocity with a classic hollywood story smothered on top of it. The film is set in the civil war and chaos of 1990's Sierra Leone, but it could have been any number of recent conflicts.  The film depicts the true meaning of the terms ""indiscriminate violence"" and ""rape and pillage,"" and places a spotlight on the reprehensible ways children can be transformed into merciless killing machines through appalling brutality.

The film also offers a thinly veiled indictment of the De Beers Group by answering a question that most grooms-to-be probably don't want to ask: How does money spent on diamonds translate into fuel for warfare? The acting by DiCaprio, Connelly, Hounsou, and a large supporting cast is fine, but it seems the film makers felt the need to sugarcoat the bitter truth they document with a classic action movie plot line. Be prepared for one-dimensional characters, plenty of clichd dialogue, and a sappy hollywood ending.  The end result is a truly violent film that is worth seeing if you have the stomach for it, but that I couldn't help but think could have been better.",1165622400,,1207,4.878048780487805
651272,5,6303365752,"MOVIE: Edward Zwick's films always strike a good chord with me because of their incredible emotional impact. The Last Samurai left such a grand impact on me that I was in tears at its incredible and emotional climax. The Blood Diamond does the same thing by establishing strong central characters with a clear objective that makes the film gripping and tense. The story revolves around Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) a local fisherman whose village is raided by local militia who are at civil war over the control over the diamond fields. These events took place in the late 90's and it serves as the backdrop of the film. Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a Rhodesian smuggler who works for a corporate diamond company in London he also works as a mercenary. He smuggles diamonds to the corporations so that they can remove them off of the market thus keeping supply low and demand high, that way they spike the prices. After Vendi is removed from his village and his family separated, he is put to work in the diamond fields where he comes across a pink diamond so rare that it could change the fate of not only his life but a nation's. Vandy is able to escape his imprisonment by the rebels but is put in prison by the police, and in prison he meets Danny Archer who now wants to set his sights on the hidden diamond. When Archer meets Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), an American journalist, she believes that his story holds the key to revealing the truth behind the diamond corporations.  When Vandy's son is recruited by the rebels he sets out on a quest to find his son while Archer wants the diamond so that he can leave Africa and start his troubled life over. Arnold Vosloo plays a general who is also after the diamond. So we have four people after one small stone for four different reasons.

The film has many sides to it. At times it's a dark look into the social and economical conflicts of Africa, sometimes it becomes a burning commentary on the nature of man, but overall this film is an intimate story of three characters placed within the setting. The main objective of the film is to tell the story of the characters where as in films like Tears Of The Sun or Black Hawk Down it's more about sending a central message. I'm not saying the latter films are bad, I enjoyed Tears Of The Suns and Black Hawk Down immensely. I'm also not saying that Blood Diamond is not trying to send a central message either. It's just that Blood Diamond really tries to tell a story, just like Zwick did with The Last Samurai. While the film portrayed a civil struggle in Japan it was more focused on Tom Cruise's and Ken Watanabe's characters so that when tragedy struck it had a strong emotional impact on the audience. Blood Diamond is not only emotional but it's incredibly tense and thrilling. There is lots of action in the film and the final air raid was executed perfectly. The story is solid and the film is an immense accomplishment. The reason why I knocked off half a star from my final rating was that I had two minor problems with the movie. There were places where a few tweaks could have heightened the emotional impact of the film and have kept the pace of the film more consistent. However, it is whithout a doubt that the film was superbly edited. The pace and structure were very consistant and strong. I was pleased by the script, Charles Leavitt did a fine job with the screenplay even though he has taken a long break from writing since his last effort with K-Pax. The second thing that bothered me was that once the movie ends and the credits start to roll we are hit with this hardcore rap song. I was absolutely shocked and disapointed with the decision to use rap in the end credits, it ruined the lasting effect of the film within a split second.

The film also displays some incredible artistic efforts. The cinematography is absolutely stunning. There is a very good chance that Eduardo Serra should be one of the directors of photography nominated this year at the Oscars. Some of the shots were truly breathtaking and of course you have to give credit to beautiful landscapes of Africa. The film's score was composed by James Newton Howard who relied heavily on African vocals for the amazing score. I have to mention here that Hans Zimmer is the pioneer of incorporating native sounds into a film's score based on location. Zimmer made African vocals his speciality with films like A World Apart, The Power Of One, The Lion King, and Tears Of The Sun. You have to acknowledge the Zimmer style in the score, but James Newton Howard makes it completely his own and delivers an amazing score. There were scenes where I wished the score was more prominent, but overall I was very happy with the musical efforts. All of the artistic efforts put together with the story make Blood Diamond what it is.

ACTING: Does Leonardo DiCaprio give his best performance yet? In my opinion I really think so. He was amazing in the film and created a perfectly accessible character that we cared for. Many people are criticizing his accent when in fact he is using an extremely authentic Rhodesian accent. People assume that since he is white and an African he must be South African. That's not the case here, people. DiCaprio does an amazing job with the role. Djimon Hounsou is also equally amazing in the film. There are a few intimate scenes with his son that will bring you to tears. He plays an uneducated fisherman with his only interests in his family, but it is his character that shows the good of mankind in the middle of this mess. Jennifer Connelly is a great actress and she portrays a journalist just as a journalist would act. She uses her wits and looks to get the story, but her priorities are not to make headlines but rather to help change the world for the better. Arnold Vosloo has a small role in the film, but I like him and think he's an underrated actor. People will recognize him from The Mummy films and his guest role on the show 24. The acting in this film is superb, the characters all carry the film and make it something to remember.

BOTTOM LINE: Blood Diamond is gripping, thrilling and emotional. I shed some tears when I saw The Last Samurai and I indeed shed some tears when I saw Blood Diamond. It's an action film with so much substance, it really pulls you in as an audience member. The few structural problems and the rap song at the end credits are not enough for me not to highly recomend this film.",1165104000,,6462,4.524379811804962
