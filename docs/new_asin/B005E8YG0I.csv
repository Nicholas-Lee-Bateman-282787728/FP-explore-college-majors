8468096,3,B005E8YG0I,"Not the best transfer of a classic to DVD. They kept the very wide aspect ratio, but kept the screen small so the actual movie is smaller than the tv. It leaves a very thick black border all around the movie.

Its just as amusing like it was when I was a kid. This version was in the original Cantonese and theres options for subtitles.",1517875200,,336,4.1692307692307695
