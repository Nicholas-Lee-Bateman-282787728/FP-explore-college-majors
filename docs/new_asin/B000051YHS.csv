1388103,5,B000051YHS,"Blu-Ray - 5/5: This is THE Blu-Ray of ALL Blu-Rays, suckaz!! This comes with the 95 minute English Language version and the 115 minute Japanese language version. The difference between the two versions is that the Japanese version has added scenes which contain happy human activities, more explicit and gory images of stuff and other weird crap like this dramatized police educational video of people shooting the camera. I guess the Japanese version was trying to be a bit more balanced between positives and negatives of American culture while the English version was more so interested in the pessimist aspects of American society. Other things is an audio commentary by the director, interviews of the director and some editor and a historian and a trailer. Neat $#!+.

Movie - 5/5: I'm not much for documentaries but this is such a mind ****. This movie made me realize why humanity is so stupid and why I question ""How did the virus exist for this long?"" Everything you see in this movie is real. VERY REAL! To some, it's sickening and disturbing. To others, it's stimulating. To all, it's educational. I fit in all three categories. As far as which version to watch depends on the viewer. If you hate foreign language and subtitles and perhaps have a shorter attention span, then the English version is for you. But if you only have seen the English version and have a quizzical need to see the additional footage then the Japanese version will not disappoint though the happy human crap is a bit silly and perhaps useless depending on your point of view. I found the Japanese narration to be more articulate but the English narration was exploitative and awesome. So it's hard for me to choose. At any rate, this review sucks and is uninformative. Have a nice day.",1478995200,5,1773,4.7752442996742674

1388105,4,B000051YHS,"One of the earlier reviews dismisses this by noting that we've seen all of this before.  Well, if your interest is merely in collecting footage of murders and mayhem, than I suppose that's true, but this is not that kind of film.  Written by Leonard and Cheiko Schrader (brother and sister-in-law Paul Schrader), the film constructs an argument (via comparisons with data from other industrialized nations) about the dangers of too-easy access to guns.  And its message is pretty darned sobering considering that this was made in 1982 and things have only gotten worse.",1375056000,10,569,5.031914893617022
1388106,5,B000051YHS,"Not a movie for the masses, but if you've come this far you will probably enjoy it. It is a good reminder that America's problems with violence have been here a long tine.",1327622400,6,171,4.212121212121212
1388107,5,B000051YHS,A Classic... if not a bit gruesome. Not to everyone's tastes but i loved it.,1237161600,6,76,4.133333333333334

7929650,5,B000051YHS,excellent movie that gives old stories new life. I didn't know half of the facts that were presented and this was just very nicely done! Bravo Chuck Riley! You have presented quite the gruesome documentary this country needs to draw attention to gun violence.,1518307200,,259,4.909090909090909
7929651,5,B000051YHS,". . . and as important as people have suggested that It is. The anti-gun rhetoric is actually rather minimal. I would recommend this documentary to people who are gun enthusiasts not in an attempt to change their minds but because It would be a shame for them to miss out on such a sober reflection of the tragedies that we have been through as a nation. This is the era of our parents generation and they went through hell to bring us the better world that we live in today. (I love you, Mom & Dad.)

7929653,3,B000051YHS,Good but felt like it played out slow and focus was put on weird events. Definitely some sights you don't see often but very interesting documentary. Wish there was a newer one with more coverage of crimes from the early 80s through now.,1494288000,,237,4.534883720930233
7929654,5,B000051YHS,"Horrendous acts of violence linked together like a disturbed undercurrent of society metastasizing. It's absolutely brilliant film making & story-telling. It is sad, graphic, brutal, yet thought provoking. The narration is compassionate, respectful, honest... humbling. I can't help but wonder what these film makers could/would create from society today.",1492214400,,355,6.26530612244898
7929655,3,B000051YHS,"Pretty compelling in that; given it's date of publication in the early '80s, it creates a tremendous time capsule documenting either the rise in concentrated violence from the late '60s onward, or the extent to which high profile assassinations during news events generated a strong enough viewer response to incentivize top-priority reporting and video publication of violent acts, which itself might have reinforced the compulsion for private citizens to more frequently cope with stress and anger through extreme, isolated incidents.

It does seem to completely ignore the formation and growth of large drug and criminal gangs, whose daily feuding and enforcement activities contribute heavily to the overall homicide rate, and is probably the Gordian knot of semi-permanent poverty and post-Jim Crow racial inequality.",1492214400,,822,5.682926829268292

7929657,3,B000051YHS,"It's pretty good for the time period. I lived through most of these times so it's old news to me but if you're going to use this as an argument for gun control then you are sadly out dated. There are many countries that ban private gun ownership but still have theft, rape, gangs, stabbings, beatings and yes they even have shootings! The fact of the matter is that just about anything can be used as a weapon and where there's a will there's a way. The ""problem"", if you want to address the issue like that, is cultural. American culture tells us,so to speak, that instant gratification is best when dealing with adversity. Got a headache? Take a pill. Overweight? Pills and surgery. Mad at your neighbor? Killing him would be easier than talking to him and maybe helping both of you wouldn't it? Even in countries without private gun ownership guns still pop up on the streets and why is that? Supply and demand.",1487030400,,914,4.5120481927710845
7929658,5,B000051YHS,Very sad...and pretty graphic. There are really some horrible people out there.,1486512000,,79,5.666666666666667
7929659,5,B000051YHS,"The Killing of America is NOT an exploitation film! It is a true documentary that has something very real to say about the culture of violence in America. What exactly that something is may be up to the viewer to decide. Each viewer is bound to take something different from the content of this picture, but you can rest assured that everything it presents is 100% REAL!

This documentary features exclusive and never before seen footage of a variety of historical events from the 60's through the 80's and presents them in a manner that lays out a well-defined picture of a nation gone mad! You will see some VERY disturbing footage, but it is shown in a way that provokes thought and reflection rather than relishing in the sheer brutality of it all.

The picture spans events from about the early 60's (the JFK assassination), through the radical late-60's (RFK assassination, MLK assassination, Vietnam War and accompanying protests). Where this film really shines is when it delves into the numerous murderers and atrocities throughout the 70's, focusing in particular on sexually sadistic serial killers and spree killers. You will see images and hear dialogue that will expose to the dark underbelly of American culture. Unlike the run-of-the-mill crime documentaries, The Killing of America puts these heinous crimes in the frame of an overall portrait of American culture that will make you question everything you know about so-called American values.

Thank goodness there is a new blu-ray for this documentary! FINALLY! After seeing it on youtube first years ago I have been wishing for an official release that does the footage justice. The new blu-ray definitely delivers the goods! Not only does is have an all-new, very crisp 2k scan of the original negative, but it features some very intriguing bonus content. I found the interview with the director very educational! My only gripe is that they couldn't find any deleted or extended scenes to include, or raw footage of when they sent camera crews to Watts or downtown L.A.

Overall this film not only compiles some of the most interesting and important footage relating to violence in the last half-century, it also features some amazing original footage that is ESSENTIAL viewing for any buffs of American history or early-80's cinema. This is a very special blu-ray release so I HIGHLY recommend you buy it right away!",1480204800,7,2389,5.01007556675063
