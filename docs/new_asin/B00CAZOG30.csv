I had never heard of Buck Jones - hadn't known he was a popular B-western star - until I read about the infamous fire at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub in 1942. When TCM aired THRILL HUNTER, I tuned in, nursing a mild curiosity about the leading man who was a casualty in the Cocoanut Grove.

It's an atypical oater, and Charles ""Buck"" Jones plays an atypical cowboy role. This film came out in 1933, a period in which western heroes were always depicted as purehearted and honest. Buck Crosby happens to be brave and he shoots straight and is a natural horseman. He's also a pathological liar. The film opens with Buck's saving a motion picture actress from her runaway horse. Marjorie Lane (Dorothy Revier), the grateful starlet, invites him to dine with her and her film crew and later invites him to come to Hollywood and shoot a film with her. Somewhere in there is a sequence in which Buck stumbles across two dead crooks and readily assumes full credit for their capture. At least he donates the reward money to a good community cause.

I won't say that THRILL HUNTER boasts the groundbreaking premise. I don't doubt that earlier films had featured a cowboy lead who's less than true blue perfect. Buck Jones has an affable way about him, even though, sure, his line delivery doesn't always flow so smooth. But he's a smooth operator during the action scenes, and, come to think of it, he does carry off his amusing truth-stretching with off-handed panache. THRILL HUNTER runs at 65 minutes, which means the plot really moves. It's fun watching our guy experiencing a series of close shaves as, in Hollywood, he tries to fake flying and race-car driving, activities which he'd lied about. I guess, back in olden days, you can say you were a cowboy aviator in the Chinese army and hardly ever get your bluff called (although the incensed Chinese cook does his best to out him). In a satiric touch, the costume department plants our hero in fancy cowboy regalia, to which he ruefully comments: ""If you ask me, I look like a lily of the valley."" And so we get the inevitable clowning from the stunt guys. Also inevitable is Buck's two-fisted reaction.

I appreciate this film for its unexpected twist on the cowboy story and for its well-executed stunt work. I enjoyed Buck Jones' take on a tarnished hero, and don't worry, he gets an opportunity to redeem himself. It seems that Buck hadn't ""nabbed"" all the members of the gang, and now the leftover hoods have abducted Marjorie, that pretty starlet. And so there's Buck off to the rescue. Where the hell's that sunset he can ride into?

I think I grinned like an idiot when, in the last scene, Buck swears off lying for good, and Marjorie laughs in his face. 3.5 out of 5 stars for this one.",1368921600,3,2879,4.595330739299611
