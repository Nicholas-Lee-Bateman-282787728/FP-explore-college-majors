8203152,4,B000RYGZXK,"This little Canadian film, based on Stanley Ellin's novel STRONGHOLD, is taut, suspenseful and very well acted. Director George MacGowan has created a superb thriller on what appears to be a shoestring.
A bank president and his family, of Quaker background, are held hostage by politically radicalized escaped prisoners who demand a four million dollar ransom. The importance of the political element is somewhat played down in the film.
The family seeks to end their predicament non-violently with the aid of members of their meeting.
Featuring some first rate Canadian actors, you will recognize several familiar faces (Ken Pogue, Les Carlsen, Maury Chaykin etc.) who have worked extensively in American or American produced films. Less familiar is Chapelle Jaffe, a superb actress (the best Hedda Gabler I have ever seen)as the troubled daughter of the bank president.
The film is gritty and nerve racking.
One should mention that there is a very inferior made for TV remake under the title A PRAYER IN THE DARK starring Lynda Carter. (Yes, the bank president is a woman in that one !)",1319414400,,1088,5.083798882681564
