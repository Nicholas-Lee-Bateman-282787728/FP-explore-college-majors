4238350,3,B00404ME1A,"In the hilarious interview of Richard Dreyfuss on this BD, he summed it up best with how this film will not get the support, advertising or distribution it should, and I have to agree as Image did nothing to push this and the specs are the most bare-boned I have seen for one of their Blu Rays.

I screened this in the store for customers and albeit painful to get through with the volume of contrived roles and cheesy acting by Dreyfuss, it will still provide some light entertainment with an ""Eastern"" (director interview) influence to it. The story follows an old man (best described as a Popeye character rife with an overindulgence by Dreyfuss - think of his role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leaves-of-Grass-Blu-ray/dp/B00390560M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leaves of Grass [Blu-ray</a>] but unintelligible) as he maintains a quaint lighthouse off Cape Cod. Enter a young lad upon his shore and they form an anti-woman bond just in time to have two lady-love-interests occupy a nearby cabin. The performances are fine and mostly tolerable, but you are happy when the film finally finishes.

The supplements are almost a parody as Dreyfuss gets interviewed for just over eight minutes - and he only talks about the film for roughly 45 seconds. The remaining interview had people stopping in their tracks as he went on a rant about history, bad Americans, the Constitution and on to population trends of the West Coast. His performance was better in this segment than in the film. The director interview lasts a few moments and he paints everyone glowingly. The BD has nothing to offer though other than a beautiful clear picture. The DTS goes unused, and they included NO subtitles or any additional dubbing. The subtitles were needed with Dreyfuss' accent as his dialogue was not clear throughout.

2 for the film, 1 for the BD clarity and .5 for the funniest supplement I have watched that had nothing to do with the film the actor was being interviewed for (granted the lady asking the questions was trying as she tried to get back to the film each time but she gave up towards the end). 97 minutes region coded A.

4238385,1,B00404ME1A,"The story looked interesting when I read the description, but the movie was a sore disappointment.  I normally like Richard Dreyfuss' acting, but he missed the mark in a big way with this one.  He couldn't decide whether his accent should be a broad Irish brogue or a clipped Yankee style, or whether it should be absent altogether.  He hammed and mugged, and generally annoyed.  The story felt  like a badly executed Hallmark presentation.  I won't  be keeping this in my movie  library.",1499904000,,488,4.795180722891566

4238430,5,B00404ME1A,"I really enjoyed this Period Piece film! It's a tale of the lighthouse keeper who is a ""woman hater"" and a mysterious British man who washes up on the beach, and how they both find love. There is excellent character development and acting, and the music and scenery in Cape Cod are beautiful. The mysteries in the story involving the characters really make it an interesting film. I found some of the dialogue, due to accents, a bit hard to hear at the beginning, and unfortunately this blu-ray does not have subtitles so I had to re-watch it a couple of times. There are only a couple of swears with God's name and My Lord another time. Other than that it's as clean as a whistle. There is a lot of comedy in this film, and the chemistry with impeccable comedic timing between Tom Wisdom and Richard Dreyfuss is second to none.  There is also a forgiveness theme and one of the characters mentions what Jesus said in the Bible. It's a movie friendly for families, but there but the serious topic of suicide is referred to briefly. I'd recommend it and it is now one of my favourites.",1474761600,,1084,4.447236180904523

A light and humorous period tale with a few twists, the story is beautifully filmed on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Blythe Danner and Dreyfuss' characters have their story well and sweetly told.

It had the feeling of people speaking off the tops of their heads, ad-lib, like it was unrehearsed.  There was no chemistry between anyone and was quite frankly, painful, to watch.  The only reason I stuck with it was because I had rented it for $3.99.  Wasn't worth the money.  I guess you have to blame the writer of the screenplay and the directing mostly, because I have seen most of these actors before in some really good roles. Worst acting ever by Richard Dreyfuss.

However, the plot has some twists that stretch credibility which I cannot reveal without spoiling it for the viewer.

Just people, and that is always more interesting.

I was delighted to find this really cute story which sort of spans generations in the love interests of it's characters.  This is no action adventure, and the storyline can be rather slow.  There are no crazy plot twists or steamy sex scenes, but if you enjoy period pieces with predictable endings, you might just pull out this one for a rainy afternoon time passer.  The acting is good.  The scenery is beckoning, and the costuming is fun.
Most reviewers seem to consider this movie only appropriate for older generations.  I might add that it would also be enjoyed by younger viewers whose movie watching takes in a broader scope than only the latest movies full of everything we really should not have our minds set on.

You find yourself rooting for all the characters to just be authentic which eventually happens. It is a very rewarding and satisfying ending.

p.s. This is the first time my husband and I have seen Mamie Gummer and wow... It is amazing how much she looks like her mother, ""Meryl Streep.""

A charming/delightful (if a bit predictable) romantic comedy you could even enjoy with your parents/grandparents.

Richard Dreyfuss is a cantankerous, ""touchy"" older lighthouse keeper who is basically happy to hide from the world, and especially women -- and he's hiding a big secret.

Tom Wisdom plays a young Brit who, near drowned, washes up on shore one day with a few secrets of his own.

Dreyfuss just had his coworker quit, and Wisdom is interested in sticking around - so Dreyfuss hires him on.

The two hit it off well as neither wants anyone probing into their personal business and aren't all that interested in prying into the other persons either -- and as it turns out they both agree women are nothing but trouble and strongly want nothing to do with them. So the lighthouse keeping life seems the perfect answer for both of them.

Things go along fine until the day comes when instead of the 2 MEN who usually rent the cabin next door for the summer, 2 WOMEN arrive instead and the women hating lighthouse keepers are in a panic.

There are a few surprises in store for them (and for a few others as well).

Wonderful performances by all. The shoreline scenery is also a PLUS.

Not just a chick flick, I think most guys will enjoy it too (though not if their the type that have to have big action in their movies, or if their taste in humor is immature).

It's a very enjoyable movie - I hope you give it a view and find out for yourself. :-)",1345680000,,1465,4.453183520599251

I must write,that before purchasing ""The Lightkeepers"",make sure you have very good hearing.  I wear hearing aids and rely on caption a lot of the time,and there was NO caption . So sadly, I had no idea what they were saying throughout most of the film. I could not turn the volumne up past 22 living in an apartment. I am sad,because this, I am sure, is a beautifully spoken film. So the ONLY grave mistake with ""The Lightkeepers"",is NO CAPTION. Hard of hearing would be able to ""watch"" this scenic masterpiece. But lip reading even proved quite impossible. Music,which is in a different form then speech,""The Lightkeepers"" music was absolutely  magnificent. It floats you away to where the waves of the Atlantic, let the sun glisten on its blue-ness. For those that can hear,ENJOY! (:",1331251200,,889,4.803921568627451

To be honest, I often find things I want from that catalog and can often find the same item at Amazon for less. Anyway, although I am not a big DVD collector, I do occasionally buy films and either keep them or give them to my friends to watch as well. Honestly, I had a hard time following some of the dialog from the main character (the lighthouse keeper who is played by Richard Dreyfuss. I have always liked Dreyfuss since that old film Mr. Holland's Opus. Dreyfuss plays a crusty old gent that walked out on his wife and now is in the ""woman's hater club."" As the story unfolds, as luck would have it, his wife comes to the lighthouse on Cape Cod, and well, the rest is what makes up the film.
I found the film slow moving, I had problems understanding some of the dialog from the way it was enunciated, and the ending was all too predictable. Although rated PG, I really can't say why it was not rated G except for one ""damn"" and maybe the discussion of a suicide. This certainly was not one of Dreyfuss' better movies but all-in-all, it was OK for a couple of hours respite.",1316304000,21,1219,4.304347826086956
4238773,5,B00404ME1A,"The Lightkeepers is a love story from the bliss of Cape Cod. The story is inspired by a book by Joseph C Lincoln (famous Cape author), ""The Women Haters."" It's about a lighthouse keeper, Seth (Richard Dreyfuss) and his new secretive trainee, assistant, alias John Brown, literal beach flotsam. They are a pair of characters, both women haters, both with secrets connected to females. This is a delightful character driven period (1912 Cape Cod) story. Filmed on the Cape location, it is as scenic as any travelogue, and the music is wonderful too. Hallmark could not have done better. this is a romance set in a time and place that will make your heart drool. A film so pure it bleeds authenticity. PG because the Cape lightkeepers smoke pipes.

Their women hater's world is interrupted by 2 ladies appearing for the summer in a neighboring cottage. Ruth Lowell (Mamie Gummer-Meryl Streep's daughter), a rich young girl, is cared for by her housekeeper Mrs. Bascom (Blythe Danner). Of course these women, of similar age to the men, pose a threat to their single gender coastal locale. The women provide some surprise twists to the story and their own characters are a study as worthy as the mens', but much more beautiful. New secrets are enjoined. Some brilliant role playing by these 4 actors.

Joining the cast for short spots are Julie Harris, Bruce Dern, and even Ben Dreyfuss as a grocery boy. Yes Ben is Richard Dreyfuss' son.

Alas, such a crime it is...NO SDH SUBTITLES or CC. This is a HUGE fault, as this DVD is best suited for the older generations, and some of us can use the subtitles. What were they thinking? No movie of the 21st century should be without subtitles, especially when it markets to the over 30 or 40 or 50.

This is a rich, calm, down-to-earth movie that moves your mind and soul.  It takes a few minutes for it to get started, but soon you will be rewarded with characters that are so real, so human so... US.  Richard D. is perfect in this roll.  Every word and action match and make us love the bugger for what he is.  His leading lady is his perfect match and foil...by not being a perfect match.  (Just like all of us.)

I like a good action flick...or a once in a while cuttem-up..shootem-up... but so often we starve 'cause nobody is real. There's no meat on the bone!  But, somehow, someone chose these actors and this script and made what we used to call a character-study of romantic proportions.  No line is wasted.
No facial expression is over-done.  ARGH! This is just a perfect movie!

The second string actors are so excellent for their parts as well.  They are superior actors well worth listening to.... they help build this movie and make it what it is.

Nice clean movie. Worth the purchase.",1305072000,,325,4.821428571428571
4238776,4,B00404ME1A,"We enjoyed the Lightkeepers more for the location than the story line. The plot isn't deep but does explore marital difficulties and the problem people have discussing them. It was a refreshing change from the gratuitous filth that Hollywood has thrown at us, both in speech and behaviour. Old and young alike can enjoy this film, the setting and history of the lights and lifesaving techniques.",1303257600,,395,5.0
4238777,1,B00404ME1A,"My wife loved it, I couldn't understand a thing !!!  They did not release this movie with closed captions, and the accent was thick enough you need the subtitles.",1298764800,,162,4.586206896551724
4238778,5,B00404ME1A,"This was a beautiful movie. I loved Richard Dreyfuss' eccentric character, and Blythe Danner was a wonderful match. This was a story about real love that endures the trials and tests life throws at it. With humor, natural beauty, fun and lovely characters, and all around goodness, this was a joy for my husband and I to watch. Very moving and heartwarming. We will definitely be purchasing this movie so we can watch it again and again.",1296172800,9,437,4.688311688311688
4238779,2,B00404ME1A,"I got this movie because I appreciated Richard Drefuss performances in ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" and ""Always"" among others. The movie scenery is fantastic. However the story is too much of a fantasy for my taste.",1295049600,,207,4.942857142857143

4238781,4,B00404ME1A,"""The Woman Haters,"" a novel by Joseph Crosby Lincoln published in 1911, tells the story of an old Cape Cod lighthouse keeper and the young New York gentleman who becomes his assistant.  Their male-only world is upset when two women come to Cape Cod for the summer and stay in a nearby house.  Coincidentally the older woman is the estranged wife of the lighthouse keeper and the other is a young lady just about the age of the assistant lighthouse keeper.  You can guess the rest of the plot which plays out in an enjoyable but rather predictable manner.

A mere 100 years after the novel was published, we have the same story - very slightly altered - in the Lightkeepers.  Despite the predictable plot, I found it quite moving - Dreyfuss and Danner are especially good in their scenes.  It's a bit slow in places, but I recommend it as a delightful period piece.",1293926400,83,864,4.541935483870968
4238782,5,B00404ME1A,"This picture is ideal for all ages for it shows good character in a time where our promises meant something. A big plus is that it has a little bit of our fading lighthouse history using acurate lighthouse terms. This story made me feel good because, like the characters, we all have something to hide. No matter how far we run from it our truths will end up staring at us. Truth is a beacon in the darkest night to warn us and guide us from danger. The message to me here is that those of us who are true to our word find that words are powerful and what we say and do is important. How we treat our spouse is the most valuable truth we can share with them.

I own this on Blue-ray and fully enjoy the story. It is a beautiful you-are-there setting in a our almost forgotten history of lighthouse keeping. The lighthouse is real and you can see the keeper light the wick just like they did a hundred years ago. A wonderful movie.",1293840000,114,930,4.166666666666667
4238783,1,B00404ME1A,"This had to be one of the worst films I've ever witnessed.  My wife and I settled back to see some ""older stars"" in a film advertised to be a charming love story.  The script was poorly written, the acting was almost laughable and the storyline entirely predictable.  What was billed as a tender love story was entirely comedic instead.  We wondered whether it was supposed to be intentional bad/camp.

Don't buy this clunker.",1292198400,4,426,4.702702702702703

Basically the entire movie was filmed at the lighthouse beach setting. The acting seemed a little too much like acting, with the exception of Blythe Danner. You know how you either get lost in the characters or you feel they are 'acting'...? That's what I mean.
Enjoyed it none-the-less as a light-hearted film in a lovely location and a warm-hearted ending.",1522713600,,535,4.763440860215054
