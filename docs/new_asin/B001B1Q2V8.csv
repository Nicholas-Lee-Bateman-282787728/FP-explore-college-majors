Well worth it. One of the best comedy shows ever.",1222819200,3,250,4.0
3479507,5,B001B1Q2V8,"You might think a comedy series 10 years old might be getting stale, but The Red Green show was always stale anyway, it hardly changed its format throughout.  If Steve Smith didn't close with the hockey stick reference the universe may have imploded.

But for me, the middle to late period is really when the series hit its stride, although it was a very relaxed gait, this never blazed with brilliance, preferring to warm with familiarity.  The annoying chain saw sound in the background is gone, and the cast settled into a comfortable ensemble; Red, Dalton, Winston and Mike causing the trouble in the main thread, with Harold commenting from the sidelines.  Comedy works best with a steady crew used to each other's timing, and when I think of the show, it's usually one of these later episodes that comes to mind.

But then I usually don't have to think of the show, it's right there on the screen, two shows a night, five nights a week of one of the local PBS affiliates, and it's been that way for years and years with no sign of slowing down.  So I wonder a bit if it isn't premature to be selling the show?  Oh well, hope they sell lots of these and Smith, McKenna, Green and the crew make some bucks, they certainly deserve it.  And if it's not on ten times a week in your area . . . well, here you go.",1221868800,6,1312,4.348360655737705
3479528,5,B001B1Q2V8,"What can one say about Red Green, either you get it and love it or you don't.  I just bought Steve's new book, Red Green's Beginner's Guide to Women(for men who don't read instructions), as a gift for my 22 year old son.  Had to pry it from my 30 years old son-in-laws hands. It looks hilarious, I'm hopping to get to read it soon and I'm the mom : )",1418515200,,350,3.915492957746479

3479539,5,B001B1Q2V8,The slapstick comedic stylings at Possum Lodge are typical for so many men. The world needs more programs like this one.,1381104000,,120,4.761904761904762

3479541,5,B001B1Q2V8,"The whacky humour of the Great White North comes thru loud and clear. This show should not be underestimated for its stupidity. I have learned a lot from it. I now keep my stick on the ice even when I don't have a stick or ice to keep it on.

Seriously great fun.",1364774400,,263,3.9622641509433962

3479544,5,B001B1Q2V8,"I love Red Green. I have loved the show and the characters since I first happened on the final 3 minutes of a season two episode on a local PBS station. I have recorded every episode that I can find, but my older tapes are getting pretty bad. Imagine my delight to see several of the seasons collected on DVDs.

The 2000 season is a pretty good one, even though Harold has departed for the city. They amped up the appearances of other characters like Dalton Humphries to good effect.

If you've never seen Red Green, might I suggest starting with some of the earlier shows so you get the full effect of Harold. Otherwise, I can recommend this collection.",1304294400,4,654,4.441666666666666
3479545,5,B001B1Q2V8,"This is one of the funniest shows to ever grace television.  Red and the rest of the gang at Possum Lodge continue with their fumbling, bumbling, and generally being men with more Handyman Corner, the Possum Lodge Word Game, and Adventure segments.  Unfortunately Red's nephew Harold isn't around this season, but they do seem to do well without him.
Seriously, you can't go wrong with this set if you're looking for funny.",1235952000,4,423,4.861111111111111

I sure miss Harold and Hap but these are still very funny shows. I highly recommend them. After this season there will be no repeat episodes from the Stuffed & Mounted series. Hopefully they will release the remaining seasons and some earlier seasons would be nice as well. ""So remember; I'm pulling for ya; we're all in this together""",1225065600,12,2050,4.599447513812155
