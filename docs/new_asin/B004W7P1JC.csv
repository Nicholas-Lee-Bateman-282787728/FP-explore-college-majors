I had the opportunity to write the first review for Eli Shaber's novel ""The Dude'Du Jour'Of Somalia""
Now, remarkably, here I am again to write the first review for ""White Boy Cool"".

""White Boy Cool""(as I've grown to expect from Shaber) is magnificently polar from ""The Dude"". ""The Dude"" offered
a prose-poetry epic-style narration peppered with powerful, humorous, exhausting and even gruesome images.
To this day difficult for me to forget.

""White Coy Cool"" is no such animal.  I adore the subtitle to death: 'Seven Acts Of Vicious Funambulism'.
I mean how funny is that? Really funny.

The Seven Acts referred to are in fact shorts stories.  These spoken-word ditties are, in and of themselves, quite interesting.
Shaber writes of 'small things'.  Little 'bite-sized' chunks of life.  But, of course, there is a twist.  A gigantic twist.
Each of 'The Seven Acts' are written is classic couplet/quatrain format.  It seems effortless and breezy, and therein lies the treat.

The stories (poems) are contemporary and bustling with beautifully crafted, musical rhyme.  As a special unexpected addition,
Eli has a marvelous speaking voice.  A lot of range.  He seamlessly moves from professorial to hipster then to downright funky.

Funky, Hipster, Professorial.  Hard to pull off, but Dr. Shaber seems to have done it with ease.  And I'll damned if he doesn't sound
like he's having a wonderful time.

I certainly did.",1313625600,,1440,5.16017316017316
