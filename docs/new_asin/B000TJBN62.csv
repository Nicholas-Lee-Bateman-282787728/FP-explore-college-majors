2901828,4,B000TJBN62,"wrong turn 2 was way better than expected. you know nowadays it's hard to come by a part 2 that's better or even close to the first, and this one does it. very good movie. it was about the same stuff, but more crazies, more story of the wood people, and lots more gore. the killings were just something else, especially the one right off the bat. man, that was a good one. it gets you from the start and you just can't help but watch you know. the actors although small time, do a hell of a job. they do it like they should and try their best to run for their lives, but how do you survive when your in their woods. it gives you a more in depth look at the inbreds and their family life. although i don't think you can feel bad for them when you know they're killing and eating all these innocent people. although some may deserve it. the director did his thing, and all i know is there should be more films like this one. i am surprised it didn't get a theatrical release, it was good enough in my eyes. oh well, as long as it was made. i do highly suggest you watch it. some parts will make you say damn, others you'll probably look away, and some will probably make you say ew! all depends on what you can stomach or like to see you know. i personally enjoyed it.",1192233600,2,1266,4.047808764940239

If you're a horror fan in the ""Suspiria was so suspensful and well directed, plus the color scheme just made the movie"" tradition, skip this movie.

2901830,4,B000TJBN62,I just recieved this movie today and i thought the gore was better than the first part. This movie shows the inbreed family and the way they killed more than the first,1191974400,2,167,4.25
2901831,2,B000TJBN62,"If you enjoy watching humans get tortured, dismembered, and then cannibalized, then get ready to be happy.  If that isn't something you crave then there really is no need to soldier on through my review because that is what Wrong Turn 2's target audience is hoping for, and they get it here in relatively sleek fashion.  If you consider yourselves among the hardcore fans of such trash then you're in luck as I have designed my review to consider this film within the context of its flawed but popular sub-genre and I think it is better than most movies of its ilk.  To think that this is also a direct-to-dvd release is impressive as well, as it is not only superior to the quality level attained in the traditional direct-to-video/dvd release, but it is also free to be as violent as it wants to without relying on the broader market to justify it's wider release.  For that alone, the film should get some credibility among the torture porn addicts.

Evidently, some toxic waste wound up entering the water supply in this region where some folks are filming a reality television show about survival.  The toxic waste had depleted the wildlife in the area quite a while ago and at the same time it also began influencing the genetics of the humans who stayed in the area.  Because they had nothing to eat and because they have evolved into deformed semi-humanoids, they soon developed into cannibals who hunt down regular folks who happen to enter the area.  You can see how this might pose a problem for the reality television cast and crew.  Anyway, these television people would be dead, eaten, and the film would've been over in 20 minutes if Henry Rollins wasn't around to take some of these cannibals out.

That brief summary sets the stage for some gruesome and at times hilarious fun.  People are eaten raw and cooked, people are blown to smithereens, people are cut in half and those parts are cut in halves too and so forth, and some people are thrown through some kind of giant grinding machine thing etc.  It's all really comical if you have the sense of humor and stomach for this sort of thing.  Some times the special effects are not as seamless as I would've hoped, but overall the gore isn't really meant to be believable.  At least believability was not the top priority.  The cannibals looked and sounded great.  The camera angles and cuts are actually pretty impressive in spurts and the gratuitous nudity was as welcome as always in these sort of films (albeit it was more brief than I had hoped).  Other than Henry Rollins, the cast includes the dude who played Jason in Freddy Vs. Jason as the leader of the deformed cannibals and Erica Leerhsen, who plays a very attractive vegan who unfortunately keeps her clothing on.  One thing I liked about this film is that I wasn't sure who the lead character was until an hour or so into the movie, so basically anyone could've died at any time.  That made it a bit less predictable than I expected.

Nevertheless, I can't rate this high simply because there is too much exploitation going on here and not enough quality storytelling or acting.  It's funny because I watched 28 Weeks Later for the second time right after I watched Wrong Turn 2 and it made me realize even more that lack of quality is just not a viable excuse anymore in the horror genre, but yet the marketing of films like this still persists.  Torture porn, gorno...it is what it is.  I guess what it is now justifies a mere direct-to-dvd release.  Maybe that isn't such a bad thing.",1191974400,7,3521,4.5968
2901832,1,B000TJBN62,"This review is short, because if we went into detail about every disappointment we had about this film, it would take an entire page...or two.

Every part of this movie is poorly done and looks totally fake.  I don't understand why someone thought that Rambo meets the inbred family was a good idea.  Even the title doesn't make sense....this plot was not a ""wrong turn"", the title should have been ""badly chosen location.""  The entire movie is cheesy at best.  Rollins may be a nice person, but he's not a great actor....the only reason he stands out in this movie is because the rest of the cast is absolutely horrible.
This is a very low budget, poorly produced, poorly directed and miserably edited movie.  My backyard is even a scarier location than what they chose.  We actually wasted the $20 on this movie and I do emphasize WASTED.  We did so, because we did LIKE the first Wrong Turn movie and were truly excited to see this one.

If you want to get drunk and watch this movie (and I do mean ""drunk"") RENT it, do not waste your hard earned money on this junk.
If there was a way to give ""NO STARS"" we would have given it that rating.  Unfortunately 1 star is the lowest on the scale.",1191974400,6,1193,4.381818181818182
2901833,4,B000TJBN62,"Just a short review to mention that yes, in parts, this film is absolutely a gore hound's dream movie.  It has excellent and inventive kills, extreme gore and sharp pacing.  It was just a lot of fun and I agree it's better than the first one.

However it also has a few really bad moments too.  There's some awful dialog and attempts at humor that mar this otherwise great horror film.  It seems so out of place and completely falls flat.  I almost stopped watching because of this one male character.  It wasn't entertaining, it was annoying.  In order to enjoy or get lost in a good horror film you must love the characters.  Happily the second half of the film switches gears and drops the stupid ""comedy"" elements and makes us care about the remaining characters.

I also want to mention that this one has moments that reminded me of Texas Chainsaw Massacre's ""dinner scene"", but in a good way.

All around this is an entertaining horror movie than any fan of the genre shouldn't miss.  I just wish someone would re-edit this film to take about about 10 minutes worth of crap footage and it could possbily be a new horror classic!",1191974400,,1134,4.504901960784314
2901834,4,B000TJBN62,"The original Wrong Turn had it's moments, but the direct to DVD sequel surprisingly outshines it in almost every way.  Wrong Turn 2: Dead End finds the pack of forest dwelling inbred cannibals stalking the cast and crew of a reality TV, Survivor-esque show.  What results next contains the basic, somewhat predictable horror elements, but Wrong Turn 2 is so gleeful in it's delivery that you'll look past it's shortcomings.  The opening scene is worth the price of admission alone, the gore effects are surprisingly good and wonderfully grisly, and legendary Black Flag frontman and punk pioneer Henry Rollins heads a surprisingly decent cast that also includes Erica Leerhsen (the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake) and Daniella Alonso (who dealt with another group of inbred cannibals in the recent, and dreadful, Hills Have Eyes 2) as well.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, and as long as you don't either, you'll have a blast with Wrong Turn 2.  All in all, if you're looking for a fun and gorey horror flick, you can do a lot worse than with what you get here.",1191888000,42,1073,4.841530054644808
2901835,4,B000TJBN62,"The beginning and the end of this movie made me come to the conclusion that this was way better than the first. Gore galore awaits you.

Now my biggest complaint about this flick is the not-so-realistic make-up effects used on the inbred-mutant family. There was something noticeably fake going on there. Maybe it's just me. You'll have to decide for yourselves.

Henry Rollins plays a halfway convincing Marine seargent. He does some battle and gives as good as he gets.

In the end, you will be entertained. Is it the best horror movie of the year? No. Is it the best horror movie of the month? In this case, that would be October 2007. I'd say yes!

2901837,3,B000TJBN62,"For what it was worth, I enjoyed the first Wrong Turn. I enjoyed the second half of this one too. The first half is pretty painful though. Bad acting and bad dialogue. A bunch horny twenty year olds out in the woods arguing and screwing. They were so annoying that I found myself rooting for the mutants to butcher them. And speaking of the mutants, the first time around I think we met three. This time we're introduced to the entire charming family tree. Henry Rollins' character was the only one I cared about. The dog-cat-mouse game of him-mutants-cast was pretty entertaining. So overall, more death, more gore. some boobies, and Rollin's roided up pecs. It's worth a rent but I wouldn't pay $20 for it.

2901860,3,B000TJBN62,"Director Joe Lynch (Chillerama, Knights of Badassdom) picks up where Wrong Turns director Rob Schmidt left off in the Greenbriar Back Country of West Virginia.  Unfortunately, Lynch doesnt do nearly as well, except when almost satirizing part 1 with slapstick gorefest violence.

This sequel features less flattering introductory shots of the Appalachian woods.  But I happily enjoyed the cameos in the opening sequence.  While on the phone with her agent her agent (Patton Oswalt; Odd Thomas), singer Kimberly Caldwell (as herself) makes the very same wrong turn that got those folks into trouble in Wrong Turn (2003) and hits a young mutant hillbilly.  The brutal tone is set immediately as the disfigured boy bites off her lips and she is cut top-to-bottom in half, dropping her intestines in a gore-slathered mess as we watch her legs fall in opposite directions!  If you don't simply love that, then you may as well stop the movie right there.

Retired marine and TV show personality Dale (Henry Rollins; He Never Died, Feast) hosts Ultimate Survivor.  The contestants include the X Games athlete Jonesy (Steve Braun; The Skulls III, Pterodactyl), overly conceited Elena (Crystal Lowe; Insomnia, Final Destination 3), artist Nina (Scream Queen Erica Leerhsen; The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Book of Shadows: The Blair Witch 2), ex-football star Jake (Texas Battle; Final Destination 3), marine Amber (Daniella Alonso; The Hills Have Eyes 2, The Collector), and the recently deceased Kimberly Caldwell.  To win The Ultimate Survivor they need to endure five days in the wilderness.  Producers Mara (Aleksa Palladino; Holidays, The Ring Two) and M (Matthew Currie Holmes; The Fog) organize as Dale barks survivalist melodrama at the contestants.

As we meet our cast of victims, the acting wreaks of stagnant direct-to-DVD dialoguethe writers clearly didn't care.  It just feels bad.  What holds it together is Henry Rollins.  Maybe Im just a fan, but he seems to be the only one who cares about his roleor maybe hes the only member of the cast the director liked.  His scenes produced the majority of entertaining action and decent on-screen kills.  It seems like this movie was made thinking of him, and to that end I withdraw my previous complaints about the film.

With head-cams on each contestant and hidden cameras throughout the forest, we watch as our victims wander into harms way.  We encounter deformed mountain men scalping people, shamefully forced gratuitous nudity, a messy birth scene of a monster baby, some decent after-the-fact gore, and a goofy incest scene.  Even if you consider Wrong Turn (2003) a bad movie, this is a badder movie that thankfully retains its so-bad-its-good status for our entertainment.  Attention was only aimed at over-the-top details (i.e., goofy incest) and not the atmospheric aspects (e.g., the inbred family cabin contains not a fraction of the macabre unkempt horror of part 1).

We have a new mutant redneck family that is a bit less animalistic than before.  Three-Finger returns from part 1 (played by a different actor) and is a less menacing, more slapstick farce of his former self.  And part 1s gas station owner (Wayne Robson; Cube, Wrong Turn) is back and, for some reason, looks far healthier.

I don't know about you, but I really loved Wrong Turn (2003). It was nothing stunning film-wise, but it scratches an itch I have every now and thenlike when I want something brutal, but not The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974, 2003) brutal.  It cultivates a fun experience, has several recognizable actors and is highly rewatchable. The shots of the forest were gorgeous (when not CGI), there was thematic admixture of things feisty and dire, and the brutality was visceral!

This sequel, however, has zero cinematography worth mentioning.  All in all, this is a mixed bag.  The brutality (outside of the playful death of Kimberly Caldwell) is over-staged and uninspired in the first hour yet somehow spectacular in the third act.  The characters are bottom-of-the-barrel, but the inbred cannibal rednecks manage to live up to the hillbilly horror subgenre in the end after a stale early introduction.  We are never nervous, shocked or on edge.  Although youll enjoy more than a few gory chuckles during Henry Rollins scenes.  They reach sloppy delight status towards the end.

Rollins basically goes survivalist Rambo. He stitches himself up, escapes being butchered, detonates incestuous hillbillies, and makes explosive arrows.  He essentially saves this movie from complete unwatchability.  By the end, this was basically trying to be The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986) with its macabre cannibal butchery, the dinner scene, and Dales crazed rescue mission into their lair.

The first half of this movie may be terrible, but it might just be worth it for the last gloriously gut-sloppy 30 minutes and, of course, the opening sequence.  It becomes a great B-movie death scene mess of gore as bodies are literally ground into chum and offal.  Oh, and of course, it gives a direct nod to usher in future sequels.",1479772800,,5069,5.114216281895504

2901896,2,B000TJBN62,"Had I known what I was in for I'd have switched this off after the incredibly well-executed first kill scene. Just because the premise calls for the characters to have been selected for the competition BECAUSE they are stereotypes doesn't make watching crass stereotypes any more enjoyable. However, the presentation of the cannibals is far more nuanced here than in the first one, and kudos to the actors for adding nice little facial and body language touches to their performances. And cheers to the decision to go with make-up which allows much more of the actors' faces to show through and emote with. This ""sells"" them as ""real"" more than any elaborate deformity make-up. Character actor Wayne Robson puts in a wonderful, brief performance that is sort of betrayed by a plot twist that strains credibility but his incredibly natural acting puts everyone else to shame. Oh, and points awarded for the NON-stereotyped treatment of the black character. I hope the Foley artist(s) got paid well b/c this is a near-non-stop parade of gooshy splats, drips and plops. After awhile the whole thing just gets too depressing and the tension is inconsistent. There's an arrow effect the camera NEVER should have lingered on for so long and this jolted me out of being sold on what was supposed to be happening. And poor Henry Rollins. He's so strong for the first half hour- and I was so relieved when he DIDN'T utter some stupid ""b@d@$$"" wisecrack after his first little victory. Finally- I thought- a movie where they don't resort to that cliche'. Well, I spoke too soon. After that he's making stupid macho jokes whenever he succeeds at something. Who the heck does this actually appeal to? And there is a ""haven't-we-had-enough-homages-to-the-dinner-scene-from TEXAS-CHAIN-SAW-MASSACRE?"" part that falls flat on its face. It's all too bad, really, because the gore is first-rate. (and the cannibals' sex and birth scenes were truly disgusting) and I am still amazed at the actor's likeness they achieved for one of the bodies. Outstanding (you get to see it in detail in the extras, which is nice) And some of the truly twisted parts with the cannibals' behavior are effectively unnerving.

2902034,1,B000TJBN62,Really bad horror movie.  Very predictable and very bad acting.  None of the sequels in this series has trumped the first Wrong Turn movie.,1392768000,,139,4.75
2902035,3,B000TJBN62,"Having enjoyed the full original Wrong Turn on DVD, and the edited-for-TV, (but still gory), versions of WT 3-5 before WT 2, I found this one to be my least favorite of the five.  The initial murder scene was more of the typical gore the rest of this series had led me to expect, but the remainder of the film came up short in showcasing the villains' disturbingly innovative and stunning slaughtering techniques.  (In other installments of the WT series, the villains' clever manipulation of the laws of physics, (with graphic results), shows how intelligent they really are, providing some conceptual ""holy kr@p"" moments along the way).

The scene in the original WT where the kids are in the villains' house having to keep quiet while they watch in horror as their friend is being butchered set high expectations for suspense in the remainder of this series.  In WT2, a couple of kids were in the villains' house during a child delivery, but I didn't find this scene nearly as suspenseful as the above-mentioned scene from the original WT.  I wasn't startled much at all during most of this movie.

To me, if humor and horror are to coexist in the same movie, you really have to pull it off right, which, perhaps unintentionally, WT2 managed to do in a couple of spots.  The first is where the villains and a ""dinner guest"" were sitting at the dinner table and they all joined hands, apparently to have a ""silent grace"" or pray.  Pray?  Really?  To whom?  And for what?  The second scene that roused a chuckle is when one of the villains' was breathing rather heavily and making grunting noises while watching a couple of get it on.  The humor to me was subtle, and didn't take away from the horror atmosphere of the movie.

All in all, I found WT2 to be the least engaging installment of the Wrong Turn series, but still worth watching.  Compared to other randy-teen hack-and-slash movie series, the Wrong Turn series to include this installment is to me among the better ones.  This movie at least held my attention well enough such that the movie was over before I knew it; always a good sign that I was properly entertained.",1390953600,3,2131,4.627659574468085

2902055,3,B000TJBN62,"It still wasn't as good as the first. It certainly upped the action and gore and was extremely fast paced but it was also very silly. It had a few serious moments but they were short lived when they happened. I will say that it had one of the best deaths (or should I say, double deaths) that I have ever seen in a long time. That was probably my favourite moment in the whole movie. Overall it wasn't that bad, but I've seen better.",1390089600,,433,4.105882352941176

2902060,4,B000TJBN62,"I'm quite surprised by the negative reviews on here.  Their quality suggests that their authors clearly aren't true fans of the genre, hence, readers, their opinions ought to be taken lightly.

CONS
--campy acting by weak characters.  on the other hand, good performance by the main actors.
--for me personally, two ""Idiots!  Why the hell did you do that in the circumstances that you're in"" moments--the cliched dumb choices victims make in times of peril.  ""Cabin in the Woods"" parodies this well.
--Requires a MUCH darker ending
--weapon physics needs to be reexamined.
--""Battle Royale"" theme should've been incorporated in a more serious/fruitful manner [i.e, survivor vs. survivor vs. mutant)

PROS
--awesome gore/blood effects
--mostly exciting death scenes
--suspenseful in the sense that the movie accomplished the goal of making the viewer root for a particular survivor.
--leaves you wanting more

There is obvious reason why this movie garnered overall positive reviews by major reviewers and  is considered the best in the franchise since, quite frankly, it is.  Of course, this movie is certainly not a viscerally sublime, thought-provoking horror masterpiece; but for those who enjoy their terror delivered in a lighter, less serious tone, Wrong Turn 2 fulfills this duty and more.

For the cheap list price on Amazon, I would recommend a purchase.  Horror enthusiasts?  Purchase.  Prefer only to buy the very best?  Skip, but definitely rent.",1381536000,,1458,5.310043668122271

2902062,2,B000TJBN62,not worth the time to watch it watch the first one then call it quits. i need more words very annoying.,1376611200,,103,3.9523809523809526
2902063,4,B000TJBN62,"I was greatly impressed with this film. It's a lot of fun and wound up becoming my favorite of the whole franchise; the only one I really cared for, but that's beside the point. The film played out more or less like what I've wanted a Hills Have Eyes sequel to be. I think filmmaker Joe Lynch has a lot of great potential. He's great on the show Holliston too. I look forward to his upcoming films.",1376179200,,398,4.181818181818182
2902084,5,B000TJBN62,"This film was an excellent sequel. Packed with gore, blood and screams, this one does not disappoint. Three-finger is almost comical in general, but that's what makes him such a good character. You can tell the actors have lots of fun making this film. The acting is not the greatest, but with B-Grade horror it's almost a requirement.

The Wrong Turn series in general is a fabulous franchise, and this film was perhaps the reason it continued. Wrong Turn 1 was great, but the strength of the original sequel can determine how long the series lasts. This sequel was excellent.",1375401600,,577,4.77
2902085,5,B000TJBN62,This is the finest work of art that I have ever beheld.  The masterful skill with which this opus was composed simply defies description.  I would give it a sixth star if I could; why should this breathtaking tribute to the sublime wonder and horror of the human condition be at the same level as such relatively pedantic works as Citizen Kane?,1370476800,,344,4.532258064516129
2902086,1,B000TJBN62,"Badly written, executed (pardon the pun), done many many..maaaany times before. Predictable and gratuitous. Ok so gratuitous is OK because it is a cheap exploitation horror flick I guess but really, even Divine could have done this more tastefully. Henry Rawlins who? Wasn't he hot once?
Save your money. It's too late for me but I will carry on and make it my mission to stop just one other person from watching this movie and then it will not have been in vain. God bless you all.",1370217600,,482,4.551724137931035
2902087,5,B000TJBN62,Liked this sequel because it is different from the other sequel's in the series. Gave this copy to my brother as a gift and upgraded to a Blu-ray copy which is much nicer. Pleased with my purchase,1369180800,,196,4.324324324324325
2902088,4,B000TJBN62,"Personally, I didn't really like the first one, because the characters were dumb. This one has a little more diversity in characters and actually gets the audience silently rooting for some of them to survive. There's not as many big names in this one I don't think, but I have no complaints about the acting. Great gory film, though I'm still not totally sold on the monsters of the series - they are totally unlikeable and everything, but hardly believable, even when the characters try to explain their existence. I did jump a couple times, but I'm easily startled, so I'm not sure if that means much.  I recommend to any who like really gory films that are meant to be scary.
P.S. If you're like me and can't stand when characters set themselves up to be killed, watch this one and just skip the first one. The characters of the first were dumb and ruined the movie. The characters in this one are altruistic to the point of being dumb, but you can't blame them for trying, you know, especially when one gives up his life for two others who do survive (spoiler alert).",1367280000,,1072,4.4974358974358974
2902089,4,B000TJBN62,"Where to begin...Ah yes....I really liked this sequel because I HATE reality shows, like Survivor.  The people are so freaking annoying and come off as complete idiots. This movie takes a reality show where the contestants are practically on the doorstep of the mutant family, and the contestants meet grisly ends (which is whet I wish would happen to most of the people that are on all the reality shows on TV now.....). As with any movie she id in, Crystal Lowe takes off her clothes to show off her incredible body, which just like my review for Wrong Turn 3,adds an extra star to my rating. Ms. Lowe is a lovely girl, and plays her part perfectly. Yes, lots of bad acting, but this is worth a rental for sure.",1366329600,,713,4.442748091603053

2902168,5,B000TJBN62,"Reality show contestant, Kimberly is driving through the West Virginia back country searching for the location of her next project. When driving, she accidentally hits a teenager. She stops to check on him, but the teenager reveals to be a cannibal and bites her lip. She attempts to escape but runs to Three-Finger, who chops her with an axe. The two drag her body halves off.

Former U.S. Marine Colonel Dale Murphy (Henry Rollins) hosted a survival reality game show in the West Virginia Forest and the other contestants: model Elena (Crystal Lowe), wisecracking skateboarder Jonesy (Steve Braun), U.S. Marine officer and Iraq veteran Amber (Daniella Alonso), former high school football player Jake Washington (Texas Battle) & a goth Nina Papas (Erica Leerhsen) starting to wait in production. After Kimberly does not show up, the show's producer Mara (Aleksa Palladino) steps into her place.

As the game starts, Three-Finger kills Neil, one of the television crew. When Dale prepares to set the games, Three-Finger and another cannibal, ""Pa"" attacks Dale before Pa knocks him unconscious. Nina and Mara find a log cabin in the woods. Mara enters the cabin to try to find a telephone as Nina follows her. When they check the house, they hear the occupants return and force themselves to hide in the bedroom. They witness a female cannibal, ""Ma"" giving birth to a mutant deformed baby. Her daughter, ""Sister"" spots them at the bedroom but Nina and Mara manage to escape to the toilet pit. The two run away into the woods, but Mara is hit in the head with an axe. As the cannibals drive up with Mara's body, Nina sets off to find the others.

After M (Matthew Currie Holmes) and Elena had sex, He returns to the RV as Elena stays in the lake. When Elena hear the cannibals and the alarm setting off, she starts to get dressed as Sister emerges out of the bushes and slashes Elena to death with a machete. While M is in the RV, he witness the cannibals driving it. Pa attacks M before returning to the cabin. Meanwhile, Dale manages to escape himself and fights Three-Finger. After a short fight, Dale shoots Three-Finger with a shotgun.

As Jake, Amber and Jonesy were eating some meat, Nina returns and tells her story. When Jake realizes it was Kimberly's leg they had been eating, He, Nina, Amber and Jonesy attempts to escape. Dale finds an old man in his cabin. The old man tells him how the cannibals' mutations were caused by effluent dumped in the river by the abandoned paper mill and then reveals that he is their father and attacks Dale. After a brief skirmish, Dale kills the old man by blowing him up with a stick of dynamite. After finding the RV gone, they run towards the woods and encounters Brother and Sister. After fighting the cannibals, Jake searches for Nina while Amber and Jonesy go for help. Jake rescues Nina from the pit and they jump to the river.

After Amber and Jonesy are killed in a trap, Nina and Jake make it to the mill. They enter the mill and find a garage full of vehicles stolen from the victims. They find the RV and Jake enters and witness M being decapitated from a live feed monitor inside. He and Nina attempt to leave but Sister and Pa capture them both. The abandoned mill is revealed to be the mutant's home. Jake is strung up and Nina is strapped to a chair with barbed wire at the table. The mutants eat dinner, also force feeding Nina.

Dale sneaks into the compound and distracts the cannibals. As the cannibals were searching for him, Dale manage to kill Brother and Sister with a dynamite attached to an arrow. He frees Nina and Jake, but Dale is killed by Pa and Ma, who were incensed by the deaths of their children. Nina successfully escapes, but Jake wanders in a room fitted an enormous tree de-barker before he was pursued by Ma and Pa. Nina returns to the mill and manage to kill Pa and Ma by pushing them into the de-barker. They find Kimberly's abandoned car and drive away to safety. Meanwhile in the river, Three-Finger is shown feeding the newborn mutant baby with a finger and a bottle filled with chemical waste. His laugh is heard as the credits roll.

2902169,4,B000TJBN62,"This is the most entertaining in the series in my opinion.... it is packed with all the guts and blood any gore hound could ever ask for as well!

Plot: Reality T.V. will never be the same because Three Finger is back and he is with a second mutated family and they are hungry.... Now, the body count is rising and the truth is becoming clearer to the contests of this survival show that they need to fight back and try to destroy, defeat, or even die from trying to stop them from ever doing this to any one ever again... even though they have done it for years!

Review: A great way to bring back a concept that has never really left but rather grown but this is by far one of the best Killer Cannibalistic Hillbilly movie sequels I have ever seen! This film doe's not ever shy away from over the top and sometimes farfetched gore! Some sequences are surprisingly intense and others are disgusting and disturbing that create an equal awesome balance.... I love the fact that the hillbillies try to live like normal people and act as though they've never done anything wrong even if there is a girl locked up in a cage in there so called house! This is definitely worth a watch or even two watches... I haven't had this much fun with a movie until I saw Piranha 3D!

Acting: Crystal Lowe is gorgeous and Texas Battle is an amazing actor and I wasn't very surprised about Henry Rollins being casted in this because to this day I really don't know nor do I want to know what he does for a living I heard he was a singer but that's about it... but I don't want to this of him as a singer I want to keep the thought of him being the Bad Ass Henry Rollins!

Gore: A body is chopped in half vertically, a double kill with one arrow, a slit throat, a ripped cranium, impalements, an exploded body, a back slashed to the point where the victims spine is showing, crushed bodies, and... did I forget anything else.. Oh yeah, a whole lot of guts and intestines are seen as well!

Bottom Line: This movies $4 million budget created a superb little flick that took in a lot of cash for a DTV (Direct to Video) flick... It brought in something like $16 million.... that's crazy good... It also played in a lot of film festivals and did great! This Movie Rocked... In my opinion this movie is on a par with the original... It still had flaws, silly scenes, and some unnecessary scenes as well but hey... that's just the kind of stuff that made this flick awesome!

Rated: R for strong horror violence and gore, language, and some sexual content

2902170,3,B000TJBN62,"The Wrong Turn series, is about cannibalism, and though there aren't that many 'horror' movies out there that cover this at least to me there don't seem to be that many out there like this.  Though some of them seem to be a little too disturbing or go a little too much in the gore department in some way or another.  I don't mind gore in 'horror' genre but I think when some studios or whatever go about doing some of their horror movies they try to go all out with the gore factor let alone maybe trying to almost go all out.  Wrong Turn 2: Dead End almost ended up going all the way especially towards the end of the movie, and though this is one of those movies that if you have a weak stomach I wouldn't recommend anyone watching then.

The story seems to be simple, though unlike the first Wrong Turn this one involved someone going a wrong way but everyone else was somewhere ready to do a 'reality' show.  Not many use that kind of story for a 'horror' film, but I don't think that it was executed that well in that department.  The acting seemed decent enough at least to me, and could've had it a little better, but I don't decide on who gets casted for whatever role that is casted for the film.  Overall there are some things that I think that could've been better, but the final version that is released is how they felt how the movie should be, so I'm not one to argue about that.

2902171,4,B000TJBN62,"Borrowing a little from Jeff Foxworthy, if your family tree, is a straight line...you might be an inbred freak.  Living somewhere in Greenbrier county West Virginia, is such a family, the product of generations of inbreeding, combined with exposure to chemicals and poisons from an abandoned pulp mill.  With no edible game in the area, the locals have taken to hunting and eating human flesh for their sustenance.  Wrong Turn (2003) provided a suspenseful introduction to these brutal individuals, and the adventure continues in Wrong Turn 2: Dead End (2007).

Retired Marine Colonel Dale Murphy (Henry Rollins) is the host of Apocalypse: Ultimate Survivalist, a reality show featuring a group of six twentysomethings competing for $100,000.  Murphy and his crew have set up cameras and various survival tests in the woods, and have just started production, when the inbreds attack the group.  Dale is quickly captured, and then hung upside down, ready to be butchered by Three Finger (Jeff Scrutton), a character who appeared in the original film.  Joining Three Finger in the hunt are Pa (Ken Kirzinger), his wife Ma (Ashlea Earl), and their two kids Brother (Clint Carleton) and Sister (Rorelee Tio).

Now facing a real test of survival, the contestants and crew are prey in a hunt, with their number being reduced in a series of brutal kills.  A two for one shot with a bow and arrow, is particularly nicely done.  Eventually the last two contestants, Nina (Erica Leerhsen) and Jake (Texas Battle), arrive at the mill seeking safety, but they soon discover that they have arrived at the inbreds homestead, and are quickly taken prisoner.  Henry Rollins' imposing physical presence is clearly evident whenever he is on screen.  His performance is impressive, and still quite believable.  While everyone else is running from the inbreds, he dressed to kill and is hunting them.  His arrival at the mill sets up the film's gritty and bloody conclusion.

It's no masterwork, and there are some dumb moments, but Wrong Turn 2 is surprisingly well written for a slasher film, including little details that help create a more complete story.  Wayne Robson appears as the Old Timer, a character also featured in the first film.  His role is quite small, yet adds a lot to understanding of what is happening, and Robson's performance is perfect.  The acting is generally better than you usually find in a film of this type.

One of the special features on the DVD is a commentary track featuring Erica Leerhsen, Henry Rollins, and director Joe Lynch.  Lynch brings plenty of enthusiasm, making this a fun listen.  Leerhsen's character Nina is made of hardier stuff than it first appears, and her transformation is a mild surprise.

Wrong Turn 2 nicely advances the tale from the original film, raising the bar and cranking up the level of gore and violence.  The special effects and gore are very well done, producing some nice shocks and thrills.  Fans of backwoods horror, are advised to check this one out.  Unfortunately the franchise takes a leap backward in the second sequel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wrong-Turn-3-Left-for-Dead/dp/B002G1WPG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wrong Turn 3: Left for Dead</a>&nbsp;(2009).",1297123200,2,3265,5.244701348747592

2902173,4,B000TJBN62,"I decided to watch Wrong Turn 2: Dead End on the description alone: a bunch of reality show contestants cross paths with a bunch of in-bred mutants.  Between the modern sensibilities of our self-reflective culture and the fact that this was a sequel to a film about mutant hillbillies, I figured it would be B-movie gold.  I couldn't be more wrong.

Yes, Dead End is a gorefest.  It begins with a half-shirt-wearing hottie getting her lips ripped off and then chopped in half, her intestines spilling in front of the camera.  Dead End is loud and proud of its blood and guts...and that scene is just the beginning.

The reality show (Ultimate Survivalist) takes place in an apocalyptic future. Each of the contestants must survive in the woods in teams of two, stumbling across tripwires that trigger an alarm. The alarm requires the contestant to perform a physical challenge within a time limit or be disqualified. The plot might seem farfetched, but there's a similar show on Discovery Channel called The Colony.

The twist, of course, is that there are actual mutants living in the backwoods where the game takes place. Each of the contestants is a stereotype: the tough-as-nails military lesbian, the heart-of-gold jock, the goofball comedian, the slut, the nice girl, etc. The genius in Dead End is that these tropes are exploited for the show-within-a-show.  The plot seems facile at first, but that's the point - reality shows aren't much deeper than slasher flicks.

In some ways, the differences between the mutants and the contestants are only skin-deep.  When director M (Matthew Currie Holmes) tries to force Jake (Texas Battle) into an onscreen liaison with Elena (Crystal Lowe), it's not all that much different than the incestuous relationship between ""Brother"" and ""Sister"" mutants - and just to drive that point home, Sister wears Elena's scalp since Brother found her so attractive.

Dead End is that kind of movie.  It's so disgusting, so violent, so vile, that you can't see the social commentary because you're wiping blood out of your eyes. Dead End uses every trick in the book, changing who will be the Final Girl, giving the military host of the show Dale (Henry Rollins) a fighting chance, and always reminding us that these inbred cannibals were people once.  They are the underclass, the underprivileged, the people who don't need a reality show to get their thrills and can't afford cable.  While upper class folks are stumbling around for cash on television, the people we can't see have to survive every day.

Dead End isn't perfect. The wisecracking jerk is so ridiculous that he's too much even for a reality show, a few of the special effects aren't rendered well, and it's pretty clear that Dead End is gleefully ripping off of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes.

But things move so fast that it's hard to even notice. Dead End is probably as good as the mutant-slaughter genre gets.  The fact that it is rife commentary on our cannibalistic tendencies to feast on celebrities in the media makes the film's meat that much sweeter.",1288742400,5,3080,4.892307692307693
2902184,4,B000TJBN62,"Now, first of all, i've seen this movie, like 2 or 3 times on SYFY. And this movie really reminded me of the Hills Have Eyes, except, there in a Rain Forest type thing, and, its a survival game show gone completly wrong.

This movie has a really good part on the gore, blood, and violence. What i like is that it keeps you on the edge of your seat. The first time i watched it, i didn't know what the hell was going to happen. But once i got into it, i was enjoying the creative way of the kills.

Now, like all horror movies, at least 1 or 2 people survive. And that is exactly what happened. But, what another thing i liked, was the skill of the host. I swear, this is one of the most badass dudes i have ever seen in a horror film. I mean, two arrows, and a barbed wire trap before the dude freakin' finally died. And, the best line of the movie, ""Is that all you got BITCH!""

But, this movie had a nice ending to it with the ""people grinder"". But had it's sick moments with the barbed wire hand trap, the clown throwing up, and the sickening birth of a deformed baby, but other than that, and all the blood, this movie had some great stuff going on.

So, overall, this was a great watch, and i was happy with the turn out to see that there were still a couple of them left to make a third movie. So overall, great movie, hope to see a 4th one.

This movie isn't anywhere as good as the first movie. It starts out with good gore (woman being split in two)but then they try to develop the characters and that is where the movie becomes boring since you still never give a shite about them anyway and that is where the yawns started to come in. It gets to the point where the only reason you continue to watch it is to see them all die horrible deaths and to the film makers credit he actually almost comes through (with a couple exceptions).

The first movie had some great acting with intense scenes,great gore and story telling,and this sequel tries,but lacks everywhere except the gore (and even that was so-so compared to the original).

Think of Psycho 2, Halloween 2, et. al., the horror genre gives itself permission to play fast and loose with continuity between narratives. While WT2 may not be as original as its predecessor, it never lacks energy or drive. Its debt to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Deliverance is obvious, and no hardcore horror fan would argue that it's not derivative of many classic offerings. But this film is fun, finely-crafted in terms of scene length and editing, and most mature horror fans will feel that it's time well spent. Satire?

2902231,3,B000TJBN62,"I thought the original Wrong Turn was an average horror film at best, so I didn't exactly rush to see what I considered an unwarranted, direct-to-DVD sequel.  I don't really understand the popularity of these inbred hillbilly cannibal freaks films.  I for one have no real desire to watch unwashed, nasty, hideously ugly, radioactively mutated, two-legged pieces of subhuman flotsam going around killing and eating people.  I just can't get in to something like that, no matter how much blood and gore you throw my way.  I much prefer my horror with erotic undertones, and there's nothing sexy about atavistic regression.  I must say, though, that I enjoyed Wrong Turn 2 slightly more than the original (but not enough to give it a better rating).  The filmmakers deviated slightly from the standard sequel script (for the first half of the movie, anyway), and Henry Rollins adds a presence the first film lacked.  On the down side, however, the opening scene ends in a laughably over-the-top manner - not a good omen for a serious horror movie.  The director makes the same mistake at the very end, as well.

The setup for Wrong Turn 2 really involves no wrong turn at all (OK, maybe one at the very start).  We're back in the state of West Virginia, but this time it's the setting of a post-apocalyptic reality game show called Apocalypse, hosted by tough ex-soldier (not to be confused with former Major Leagues MVP)  Dale Murphy (Henry Rollins).  I won't go over the rules of the game, but the gist is to survive over the course of five whole days in a world full of rigged post-apocalyptic dangers.  Whoever scouted the area somehow missed the family of local degenerate cannibals that call the place home - but it doesn't take long for both contestants and crew to meet up with them.  The six contestants are an interesting mix.  You have an African-American former football player and all-around good guy (Texas Battle) that I dubbed ""Tiger Woods;"" a wise guy who can't stop hitting on the female contestants (Steve Braun); a tough, gung-ho female veteran of the war in Iraq (Daniella Alonso), some nice female eye candy (Crystal Lowe), a pretty girl whose troubled past has made her a survivor (Erica Leerhsen), and a producer turned contestant (Aleksa Palladino) who has to replace a reality show B-celebrity (Kimberly Caldwell) who never shows up (for a very good reason).

I don't have any real complaints about the special effects brought to bear here - there's one explosive death that's truly impressive, and the whole film is pretty much blood-stained.  The hillbillies, of course, all look as ugly as homemade sin.  The film doesn't boast a lot of character development, but it does give us a rare treat in the form of potential victims who all try to escape rather than stupidly walking into their own gruesome deaths.  Notice I said ""try to escape.""  I should also mention that there is one scene that is potentially controversial - and it has nothing to do with blood and gore.  It definitely stands out in my mind, and you can't help but wonder why it was included in the movie.  I don't know if the filmmakers were making a statement, or if they were just trying to generate a little more word of mouth publicity over the proverbial water coolers across the land.

All in all, Wrong Turn 2 is a decent little horror film, but one can only hope that this is the end of the line for the Wrong Turn franchise.  Neither of the first two films is good enough to merit a third installment.",1212192000,3,3504,4.69721767594108

The sequel to the more serious and atmospheric original Wrong Turn(2003) relies much more on action and gore.  This is a largely gory flick folks.  If you seek gore and guts in your horror movies, look no further.  Truth be told, I had a blast watching this, and I like it a lot more than the original.

Wrong Turn 2 most certainly delivers on the action and death scenes.  Many of which actually disturbed me a bit, and that hardly ever happens.  The film is twisted!  This makes the original look like a PG-13 film.  I loved the effects.  You can tell the makers of this film had a blast and really tried to put the best on screen as they could. The death scenes were pretty creative and convincing.  Many of which are wild and I was shocked with a few.  Very cool and twisted stuff.

Acting is another step up from the original.  The original had very little good or even decent acting in my book.  Some of which came off a bit too stale even for a horror film.  This flick has much better acting.  Some of which takes itself seriously when needed and can be a bit more campy when its called for.  The film overall doesn't take itself nearly as serious as the original.  I like that about this movie; it delivers all the goodies and never becomes overly serious.  This type of film shouldn't, and it seems a lot of negativity comes from people expecting it to be a serious horror classic like The Omen or something.  If you want that I don't recommend this.

As a result I really wasn't expecting much of this movie despite enjoying the first, not merely for the gorgeous Eliza Dushku either. The premise is nothing new, but the characters, gore and inventive kills make it well worth watching.

The always cool Henry Rollins (who I'd pay money just to see reading the bible) plays a retired Army Colonel who is now hosting a faux-post apocalyptic reality game show. The setting: the woods. But not just any woods, this is inbred hillbilly territory and they are only too happy to devour a bunch of young city folks.

Erica Leerhseen (who seriously does not look as old as she is) plays Nina, the cynical, jaded one of the group who keeps her cool when the guts start spilling. Usually with these movies you can tell exactly who is going to die and in what order, but Wrong Turn 2 still managed to seem fresh. I wasn't simply waiting for characters to die or wishing that they'd hurry up and meet a grisly end, since such fodder are usually highly annoying.

The one thing that I didn't like was the utterly flat photography. The original had a dark, grainy and hardcore look to it but the sequel just seems so clean and bright and open. I think that if Joe Lynch was perhaps a more experienced director then the film would look tighter and more dynamic, as it is the cinematography does little to compliment the above-average production design.

If you are a fan of the first movie then I totally recommend that you give this one a go. It surpassed my expectations and I'm usually quite a snob when it comes to movies.

The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound and a handful of extras.",1199664000,3,1764,4.5

Very slow to start off, but when it gets going it's an all out gore hounds delight. It's also got some very graphic undertones throughout.

2902272,4,B000TJBN62,This sequel doesn't disappoint.  I watch many horror films and surprisingly Wrong Turn 2 is probably the one with the most gore/horror. The style/feel of the movie is similar to the remakes of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre films.  I rate it 4 stars.,1198368000,,247,4.72093023255814
2902273,3,B000TJBN62,"I'm a bit bored of mutant hillbilly films and Wrong Turn 2 didn't really do it for me. The whole reality TV thing is a bit trite and the character's were more caricatures - maybe that was the filmaker's intention but I don't really care enough to find out. That said, the gore is really well done, and with a decent script this could have been so much better than it was. Also, to be honest, I missed Elisha Dukhu. If she were in it and the innane people were not I may just have liked it more.

Great gore (the axe murder at the beginning is really well done and inventive) but couldn't maintain my interest with this one.",1197158400,,623,4.191666666666666
2902304,3,B000TJBN62,"Ok this wasn't half bad, but it wasn't impressive. I jumped maybe once. It's pretty gross but the storyline was just eh. The 1st had you grossed out with the inbreds.. This one had them too it's just they seemed to human like and the day shots were boring..
They didn't scare me. Id rent it but not buy. Id never watch it again.",1196035200,2,328,4.140625

What could have been a fun romp -- it does, after all, have a great premise and Henry Rollins in a lead role -- instead is dragged down by a cliche-ridden script, completely unlikeable characters and a lack of originality. The first five minutes offer a bit of lighthearted fun and a rather imaginitive bit of gore, but it's completely downhill from there.

I really didn't enjoy my time watching this movie, some of the reaosns that didn't make me enjoy the movie are, the acting wasn't that good, the voices made by the (monsters or whatever) wasn't good and dones't suit the situation, I mean ugly creatures should not have a soft voice(like the ugly girl creature), finally, the story wasn't any good.

2902308,5,B000TJBN62,"Well, I would like to start with saying the first wrong turn was great! This movie was also very good, as good as the first.  The cast was very enjoyable and likable. The special effects and gore was great, and very real. It is the best horror sequel I have seen since The Devils Rejects.
So, the plot doesn't sound very interesting;a group of people taping a reality tv show, but it surprisingly turns out to be very interesting and a very satisfying horror film. It is worth renting, even owning. Get this movie, you will not be disappointed!!!!!",1195171200,2,548,4.5353535353535355

2902310,4,B000TJBN62,"I loved the first movie. It's one of my favorite horror movies. But this one fell short. The people were killed off way too quickly. Maybe it was because there were so many of them. The person that I wanted to live, died. One second she was alive, the next she wasn't.

2902311,4,B000TJBN62,"""Wrong Turn 2:Dead End"" is the perfect example of a whole bunch of good mixed in with a whole bunch of bad and the outcome proves to be fun as hell. No, this is not even close to part one...but it wasn't supposed to be. For those of you who love Tobe Hoopers 1974 masterful classic ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" because of how raw and truly scary it was, yet also found his wildly goofy 1987 sequel entertaning as well, then ""Wrong Turn 2"" is just for you! This is a very funny gorefest with a handful of creepy moments scattered throughout. If you go into this film expecting an all out horror flick then you'll most likely be disappointed, but if you go into it not expecting to much you will most defintiley be pleasently suprised.",1194393600,2,730,4.375

2902313,3,B000TJBN62,I would have given this film a little bit more of a star but I don't want you think that this is anything original. Its not a bad film but its not great. The Film is based around a reality show filming out in the woods where the contestants have to survive a nuclear blast that has left everything in ruins. If you can get past that and the silly cast you will enjoy the rest. After all that are mutunt faimly who I compare to the Hills Have Eyes but for the woods begin to pick off all the players and of course take them back to feed on them. It has some really brutal violence and good effects. If it where not for this I would not have cared for the film. Other than that its not a bad rent but just get through the thin plot and you might enjoy this one.,1193616000,4,759,3.903225806451613

2902355,1,B000TJBN62,"What a shame - i had such high hopes for this movie after originally watching ""Wrong Turn 1"" a few years ago still one of the best horror thrillers made in years till ""Disturbia"" , ""Turistas"" , ""Severence"" & ""Vacancy"" came out recently .

This sequel was such a DISAPPOINTMENT - from the beginning i sensed a poor cast , poor idea , poor script , poor characters (you want them all killed - they are such vile individuals).

This film contained none of the above - it made no sense and the title ""wrong Turn"" didn't apply at all - they knew exactly where they were - making a reality show in the woods - duh !! Normally you would think that film companies with a $100,000 prize would have been into the woods in advance to source the area etc - not on this shoot !!

I didn't want to write this much - but rubbish like this is being churned out all the time using the good name of an original - unless all you want is loads of gore , naked bosoms , fornication - then this is the one for you - forget storyline or if any of it makes any sense !!",1193443200,6,1045,4.014423076923077
2902356,5,B000TJBN62,This was a great movie based on gore alone. I know some people hate the reality show premise but overrall this is a well done movie. The violence is more intense than the first movie and the gore is plentiful. I thought it was a well paced movie as well.

2902358,1,B000TJBN62,"As a lifelong horror fan, and I've seen thousands of them in my many years, I have to admit that today's horror movies just don't know when enough is enough.  I admit I continue to squirm through these bloodfests as if addicted.  But if this is entertaining, then I think our society is truly sad.  I've sworn off the spate of ""torture"" films like the many SAWS, HOSTELS, etc., and I should have sworn off this one.  There's nothing truly entertaining in this blood soaked brutal movie, where young people are sadistically murdered and then eaten.  And of course, there will more than likely be a WRONG TURN 3 because the world is still full of we horror addicts who just gobble them up (pun intended).  But if like me you're getting sick of them, let's make a secret pact to avoid these unredeeming assaults on human dignity.",1192924800,6,826,4.547297297297297
2902359,4,B000TJBN62,"I just wish they had at least explained what happened to the folks in Wrong Turn even if it was just a few minute deal or something.  But other than that i found myself rather enjoying Wrong Turn 2..most of the times sequels don't really measure up to the original (sometimes its not the case but more often than not).  This one however does a bang up job of delivering on its promise tons of gore, violence, campy horror humor and of course a make out scene (which obviously leads to someone getting cut literally).  I don't really know any of the actors/actresses except for Henry Rollins who pretty much steals the movie in my eyes.  You've gotta check it out to believe someone of the stuff that happens in this one.  I do know the girl in the beginning of the movie was from American Idol but those are the only two people i knew before the movie.

They do a great job of showing that while those mutated freaks in the movie have major insanity/violence issues.  They are still a family unit and it does show how they came to be the way they are.  It has to do with people and chemicals poured into the river causing birth defects (duh obviously).  I loved it more than enough action, killing and blood to last and satisfy even the most hungry horror buff...opening sequence in the movie WOW.

Thats all i will say on that you need to at the very least check this movie out rent it or something.  But give a shot and forget that you don't know what happened to the folks in the first one.  By movies end you will be feeling for these guys and girls in Wrong Turn 2.

2902362,3,B000TJBN62,"Now, first of all, I didn't see the first Wrong Turn, but I'm guessing Wrong Turn 2 doesn't exactly answer all the questions the first one left hanging. Aside from that, I had read mostly negative things about the first one, so I opted to pass on it, as I'd already seen Deliverance and the original The Hills Have Eyes, anyway. I mainly saw this direct to video sequel owing to Henry Rollins being in it (Rollins vs. mutant hillbillies doesn't sound like a huge departure from what his career has been mostly about, anyway), and also owing to some early good buzz I had read. I mostly liked it, and thought it was much more deserving of a theatrical release than The Hills Have Eyes 2, which was a huge disappointment. Wrong Turn 2, which features numerous references to horror movies past, particularly those in the 70's and 80's, manages to work up some genuine suspense and uncorks some surprises here and there, and definitely delivers the gore, deliberately going over the top in that department. (The opening sequence pretty much sets the tone if you're wondering what you're in for with this movie.) The cast, most of which I didn't really recognize, save for Rollins, is pretty good. The one intentionally annoying character fortunately gets less annoying as the movie goes along.  Wrong Turn 2 only really falters towards the end sequence, which lacks a lot of the punch you're hoping it's going to have. All in all, it's an above average horror flick, and is definitely head and shoulders above most of the terrible direct to video horror junk being hoisted upon DVD audiences these days.

P.S.  Regarding my comment about a theatrical release, I have since read that the director was offered one for Wrong Turn 2, but would have had to severely edit the film to qualify for an R rating.  He opted to pass on that so audiences would be able to see the film in all its unrated, gory glory.",1192233600,13,1899,4.626112759643917
