7767691,5,B01GTBMTIO,"Once again Amazon gets it wrong!! This is an all region Blu-ray! This is a very well shot concert. Very clear. Camera is focusing on the right people at the right time. The sound is 2 channel stereo only, but it sounds fantastic! Every instrument is very clear.  The talent, as always, is very high, but it seems Neal has finally found the right mix of band members to carry on in the future. Bill and Eric are very welcome additions to the band, both have great voices and are phenomenal musicians. The highlight here is the song Alive Again, particularly when they all switch instruments mid song. Who knew Bill was such a great guitar player??!! Eric is no slouch on the drums and as many times as I've seen Neal do this stunt, this is the first time I've seen him play the bass...and as expected he's great! Another highlight is Waterfall. What a great execution! Highly recommended!!",1470787200,,888,4.55
7767692,4,B01GTBMTIO,"This is NOT a Region B disc. It's all-region, and it WILL play in your US player.

Also note that the audio is PCM stereo [UPDATE: no, it's Dolby Digital stereo]; there is no multi-channel audio.

I have not thoroughly watched and listened to this yet, so my rating may change. But I thought those two facts were important enough to post right away. What I've seen so far (mostly the performance of ""Harm's Way"") sounded and looked very good. The HD video looks fine, the camera work is fine, the mix is very clean. More later.

UPDATE: This band sounds a lot like Spock's Beard, even down to the wonderful, tricky vocal arrangements that sometimes even feature a capella contrapuntal chorales. That's a good thing. The biggest difference now is, of course, Neal's writing is less cynical and disillusioned, and more inspired by his now well-established spirituality. Full disclosure: Personally, I am a member of the Bill Maher school of atheistic hostility to religion. But on The Grand Experiment album and in this concert, Neal's religious underpinnings rarely intrude in ways that are any different from the spiritual or mystical or supernatural beliefs of myriad other artists. No, it sounds like melodic, complex, impeccably performed, and often quite musically challenging progressive rock... without most of the angst.

The only exception: the two-song acoustic set. The first song is a sermon; the second song is so badly afflicted by out-of-tune guitars that I was unable to listen to it. I have deducted a star for the inclusion of two songs I will want to skip every time I play this disc.

The video quality is very good; occasionally a bit grainy and with somewhat oversaturated color, but generally crisp and clean. Camerawork is excellent for a contemporary rock video; lots of interesting angles, soloists are almost always picked up properly, not too many quick cuts.

Now, about the audio. Thanks to ""Bry S."" for pointing out that the encoding is Dolby Digital instead of PCM. And you can hear it, unfortunately. It's the difference between (at minimum) a well-recorded audio CD and a high-bitrate MP3; most of the time it's OK, but when the music gets busy or on vocal peaks you can hear the edge of distortion characteristic of lossy compression. This is substandard for Blu-ray, where uncompressed high-resolution audio is normal.

Is the concert still enjoyable? Sure. Is the music rewarding, even sometimes majestic? Absolutely? Do I recommend the disc to any fan of neo-prog, of virtuoso musicianship, of top-tier live rock performance? No question. But it won't be a demo disc for your high-end home theater sound system, and that's kind of too bad, because it could have been.",1470700800,6,2704,4.969026548672566

8763488,5,B01GTBMTIO,"Another great prog entry. Neal Morse is a masterful musician and composer, backed by some excellent musicians .",1482710400,,111,5.222222222222222
8763489,4,B01GTBMTIO,"The first thing that strikes you when you listen to this live release is how the stereo sound is
loud and clear. The picture is also clear with vibrant colors. I was happy to have a live release
from that tour because I have enjoyed the first output of The Neal Morse Band. The music has that
Neal Morse symphonic grandiose style but being written in collaboration with the others musicians,
there is still more than the symphonic approach. ""The Call"" is a dynamic opener with a break in the
middle where Neal is singing with all the emotions we all know is capable too. The bass sound is huge,
with some heavy guitars and keyboards lines. The first part of this song is rather inoffensive, but
in the second half, it goes in the complex progressive style. And we won't talk about the impressive
playing of Mike Portnoy on drums. ""Leviathan"" is a heavy and fast track from ""Lifeline"" of Neal solo
career with a rather dark intro. ""The Grand Experiment"" is a good old rock song with some Styx vocal
harmonies, repetitive but catchy. Next is a song from the Spock's Beard material, it's ""Harm's Way"" that show
the typical change of moods of a Progressive Rock epic. Then comes a nice Keyboards/piano solo of
Bill Hubauer remind me of Gentle Giant. After another song from Neal's solo stuff, it's time for an
acoustic pause that is apparently different each night. In this, Neal is crying and if this song
means something lyrically for him, it's not very challenging musically. Then the epic song of the
last album ""Alive Again"" brings us some heavy instrumental parts that show the musicians exchanging
instruments with some surprising results in an improvisation mode. We are greeted with a bass pedal
solo from Randy Gorge with his hands! Bill Hubuauer delivers some beautiful vocals harmonies in this. The
 show ends with an emotional medley of Neal's solo songs.

I think this product is the closest a Neal Morse project has come to perfection if we take into
consideration the sound/visuals and music. The editing and camera work is still very professional.
The only criticism I could add is a subjective one, I would have replaced some songs from Neal's
career for others and play the song ""MacArthur Park"" from the last album.",1478131200,,2231,4.717948717948718
8763490,4,B01GTBMTIO,Great music and excellent musicians. The lyrics are too religious for my taste but I was able to get past that by focusing on the performances. Excellent hi-res video and audio.,1477353600,,177,4.741935483870968
8763491,5,B01GTBMTIO,"I absolutely love this concert disc, and have watched it multiple times as the music and the performances are just stunning. Neal and his band continue to amaze, and Eric Gillette is so talented on guitar that I had to seek out his two solo albums. The Christian lyrics don't bother me as the music is just amazing.",1475712000,,315,4.448275862068965
8763492,5,B01GTBMTIO,"Beyond my expectations. Virtuoso players with awesome music, great energy, christian message, positive message as well.
The crowd was good as well. Mastery in sound and editing. Worth to have concert from one of the best composers in history.",1472860800,,242,5.230769230769231
