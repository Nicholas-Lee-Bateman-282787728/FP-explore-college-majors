7981206,5,B00008AOVX,"As a history fan I enjoyed all the historical photos of this time period.  Yes I can see that some modern students might be put off by pictures of gasp! ""Old"" people  however.
I thought it had a certain charm however.",1520640000,,217,4.2682926829268295
7981207,1,B00008AOVX,"Very slow pace, feels as old as it is. This film has not aged well. Showed it to my 9th grade history class, they HATED IT! I love the NBC Project XX series, but this one is definitively a miss! Good narration, but just old photos...sometimes the photos are repeated and make no sense with the narration. Negative stars, avoid.",1493510400,,327,4.466666666666667
7981208,4,B00008AOVX,"Released in the 1970's as part of NBCs Project Twenty documentary series, this video looks at the changes in America and Clemons himself during the mid-1800s to just a little beyond the turn of the century.  His experiences growing up in the small river town of Hannibal, Missouri as well as his travels to Nevada & California and subsequently to Europe certainly provided much material for his humor and wit.  While this DVD is not as in-depth as Ken Burns documentary, I found it very enjoyable.",1390262400,,497,4.767441860465116

7981210,1,B00008AOVX,"This is a quick overview of Mark Twain's life. There is very little about the Guilded Age in it. I had hoped there would be more substantive history in there, or more of his humor.",1208217600,,180,4.171428571428572
