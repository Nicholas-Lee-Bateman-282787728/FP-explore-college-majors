2431266,4,B000BO0KOQ,"First of this movie is cheesy!  The cheesiness does bring it to an actual watchable movie.  The movie's plot is very basic, demon going to send evil toys (demonic toys)around to world to kid on Christmas Day and Puppet Master have to save to day, you know the usual.  You really need to watch this movie with a relaxed brain because if you take this movie seriously you probably won't enjoy it.  For those out there who are puppet master fans check this one out.  It's a different change from the rest.  This movie is actually humorous considering the strange but funny act Corey Feldman does.  It's quiet funny!  The special effects are, well, bad but in a good way to an extent to be enjoyable.  Also just remember that it was made on SCIFI channel so don't expect a true ccult classic.",1132358400,5,788,4.454545454545454

2431268,5,B000BO0KOQ,"It's the Living Dead Girl here; and this my friends is my favorite puppet master! So 1st off let's start with people saying how bad this one is....Cause I can already tell you I saw this movie in Nightmare Before Xmas it's what Jack did with the presents...only its a whole movie, and that's pretty cool! Plus Corey Feldman is a great puppet master! I like the Older Generations thing; the only qualms I have is with what I heard the remakes were gonna be, The puppets fighting the mummy and later Dracula and Frankenstein...I think that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard, and I am So glad they didn't make those!",1379116800,,615,4.5
2431269,3,B000BO0KOQ,"I absolutely adore Puppet Master so this movie gave me high hopes. While it didn't live up to those 'high' hopes as I'd wanted, it was still a decent watch. The acting in it was...to say the least, had a 'forced' and almost amateur appeal to it which brought down the already low budget feel it gave off.

But I have to admit it was nice seeing the classic Puppets back in action again...even with the upgrades.",1347840000,,411,4.337662337662338
2431270,1,B000BO0KOQ,"This sucked so BAD. I tried twice to watch it and ended up shutting it off not even half way through. Not surprisingly Full Moon Pictures didn't produce this one. Which is obivously why it sucks and is not a legit entry to either series.  Most of the puppets/toys don't look anything close to the originals. I cant believe Corey Feldman was in something like this, he's better than that. Charles Band himself called the film Non-Canon because it was not made by him or his company Full Moon Pictures. Not worth renting, buying or watching on tv. It's not even amusing accidently . Avoid at all costs!!!",1346716800,,602,4.574074074074074

2431272,1,B000BO0KOQ,"This is an awful addition to the puppet master, & demonic toys movies. The toys in the movie look like they were assembled in like 2 minutes with some cheap scrap plastic. Fullmoon just doesnt put anything in to their movies anymore. This is a disgrace to the other movies. If this movie were made in the 90's like the original series, it would probably have been fantastic. Don't even bother with this movie, its not worth your time.",1291507200,,434,4.506329113924051
2431273,2,B000BO0KOQ,"When you take two decently well known horror icons of the genre, and decide to pit them against each other, it tends to sound cool in concept, but once it goes into production, the real nightmare begins. This is definitely one of the poorer thought out and executed ""vs"" movies to have been created. First off, if ""New Moon"" where not the ones making a Puppet Master film, then you knew it was doomed to fail. New Moon haven't always hit the mark in all the movies they have done of the PM series, but you just know someone else could have done it worse.

The movie begins with Corey Feldman, a father character and his daughter. The voice Corey used for his character I thought was a joke that was going to pass, but no, he stuck it out for the whole film. A stupid voice that sounded completely fake and irritating. It seemed like another one of these movies Corey did just for the money, and didn't bother to do a decent job in earning it. If I was directing him on the first day, i'd slap him on the side of the head, tell him to stop being an idiot and do the job properly, or else find someone better with more talent for half the price.

The plot is that whoever Dorky Feldmen is playing is the decedent of the Puppet Master and has done what no one else in the PM franchise has ever been able to do before, and recreate the serum to bring the puppets to life. Only for some reason the serum is blue now, not green... why? Because no one bothered to watch any of the previous PM movies most likely.

So while he and his daughter and bringing life back to the dolls, he is being spied on by the chick from Weird Science who has made a pact with the devil to ship out a bunch of demonic toys that will come to life and slaughter children on Xmas day... but she also finds out about Toulons puppets, and wants them for herself, so when she gets involved trying to steal them, Toulon (Feldmen) decides he must save the toy and put an end to her evil plans with her help from the Demonic Toys.

Overall; a pretty pathetic movie...  the Demonic Baby has a few laughs with some fart humor, but overall, if they had cast someone better then Corey Feldman to take the role more seriously, and notched up the terrible acting on most others parts, it might have been passable as a decent B-grade TV movie.",1278979200,,2301,4.220454545454546
2431274,1,B000BO0KOQ,"This movie is awful. Simply stated.

When the idea was first presented that there would be a Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys movie I was intrigued. These two movie franchises on their own are excellent B-Film fare. This movie destroys all preconceptions and leaves a bad taste in even a tasteless mouth.

Let me just say a few things. I own and love the original 5 Puppet Master films, and can find joy in watching Curse of and Retro. Demonic Toys and Dollman vs. Demonic Toys were short and sinfully sweet.

These two movies coming together should be just as fantastic as each alone. I mean, it's simple. Take a bunch of dolls and duke it out.

This movie kills in ways it didn't intend to. The puppets look awful. The acting is awful. The story is awful. I don't even think the creators watched the prior films. Look at the cover alone, zero quality was put into this movie.

I'll also admit to being a Corey Feldman fan in the 80's. I don't think I've seen a bigger train wreck since Banned from TV. He's horrible here, not even camping it up at a B-film level.

Skip this. Wait for the revamped Full Moon sequels of both Puppet Master and Demonic Toys currently in production (and check out trailers online).

Keep these films out of the wrong hands Charles Band, please!?",1266192000,,1275,4.469827586206897
2431275,5,B000BO0KOQ,"I have been a huge fan of Full Moon Movies and just the B genre in general. The thing that we have to remember is that in some sense or another it was intended to be bad which gives it the sense of its campyness.

Alright since that has been said I'll begin with the actual review of the movie. The Puppet master series is the ongoing series created by Charles Band which is about (in a general sense) the Tulon family and their mystical killing puppets. The puppets are neither good nor evil only obeying the whim of their ""Puppet Master"". Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys was created as a christmas special for tv and dvd so it wasn't intended to be a huge blockbuster hit or even a full counterpart to the actual Puppet Master Series. In my opinion it is a great fun filled adventure with fun B-Movie effects and horrible acting which add to the flavor of this movie, and come on we don't watch puppet master for the acting we watch it for the PUPPETS! Unlike the other Puppet Masters we a get a full view of how the Puppets are and how they act on a more free basis without the strict orders of their puppet master. In this movie you actually get some sense of emotion and in way you get attached  to the puppets on an emotional level.

This movie started a tradition in my house hold every christmas we pop this DVD in just to have fun and it still isn't old to us. It's easy to understand why some people do not like this movie, but hey if everyone loved it, it probably wouldn't be the same. If you love B-Movies or Full Moon In general give this movie a shot it's just a fun way to spend time, get a few laughs out of it and just enjoy it for what it is.",1256860800,,1659,4.114197530864198
2431276,4,B000BO0KOQ,"As an avid fan of Full Moon productions, and their horrible films, I just had to watch Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys. The first thing I found out was that this film has nothing to do with Full Moon except for it's puppet characters. Charles Band often receives credit as the Executive Producer but had nothing to do with the film. Full Moon originally planned to do the film as part of a mini-series in the 90's, but they had to drop the idea when they didn't have the funds to get the job done. They must have really hit a low point since it couldn't possibly take much money to make any feature they do. Thankfully the Sci-Fi channel stepped in to grab the idea and do the movie under their studio and now we have a mess of a Christmas movie with killer puppets.

Taking place in California, the nephew of deceased Toy maker Andre Toulon Robert Toulon (Feldman) is now the owner of the Toulon Doll Hospital. As he continues to find a formula to bring the puppets to life he accidentally comes to find his blood is the missing ingredient to doing just that. Once he gets the serum finished he injects the Puppet Master puppets and back to life they are. The only problem is rivaled company Share Toys, run by the evil Erica Sharpe (Vanessa Angel), have been spying on Robert in hoped of finding this serum for their own Demonic Toys. They want to create these toys in time for the Holidays so Christmas morning each household will be slayed by the evil gifts. Talk about spreading holiday cheer huh? Once Robert finds out their sick plot he gets his puppets together and they have the ultimate b battle royal.

I have to say this one will be a new favorite in the holiday collection. Not for it's good acting or well written script but for the hours of laughter it provided. Corey Feldman was simply awful. He is supposed to be an older scientist type but just looks like himself with some cheap gray hair coloring. He also talks raspy somehow thinking that will add the years. It really was just perfect for my expectations. For any fan of the Puppet Master or Demonic Toys series this one is a must.",1247443200,4,2103,4.403598971722365
2431277,3,B000BO0KOQ,"Contrary to the original Puppet Master series, this movie attempts and fails at being funny. However, if you're a Puppet Master fan or collector, then I recommend this film.",1243641600,,173,5.0
2431278,4,B000BO0KOQ,"In 1989 the world was introduced to a company soley commited to the b horror community best known as Full Moon productions. The creator of this low budget empire is Charles Band who created Full Moon as a second attempt after he failed miserably with another production company. His first release was Puppet Master which came out on VHS and laserdisc (yeah laser disc, awesome) and turned out to be a huge success. This would get the ball rolling turning out a huge cult following causing Puppet Master to turn into a series of films. As the years rolled on Charles Band was asked to make some slasher flicks to try to compete with the ""Scream"" era and did so under a new production company known as Shadow Films which only lasted two years after the films failed. Charles then decided to rebirth Full Moon and which brings us to tonight's feature Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys. This film is a beautiful combo of the puppets from Puppet Master and the toys from Demonic Toys in an all out feats of strength. Is it possible for anything to be more B then this? Now looking at the four star rating may make you wonder why would we give a rating so high. See the thing with Full Moon productions is if you are willing to watch one then you know what to expect. You look for terrible acting, horrible special effects, and a little comedy mixed in. If they produced an actual great film we'd probably give it 1 star due to extreme confusion.

We start off 2 days before Christmas (Oh Boy! Sid's favorite) with Toy maker Robert Toulon (Corey Feldman) as he and his daughter work on the puppet master puppets. Toulon is the family that gave birth to these puppets and now their lives belong to Robert who cares for them. The only issue is they aren't alive anymore which forces Robert to go nuts trying to find a serum that will revive them. Batch after batch won't work until he accidentally cuts himself and blood drips into the mix. Once he does that it starts bubbling up and changing colors. He injects the mix into the puppets and within a few minutes they are back to life. The puppets are actually good and live to protect Feldman's family. Who would've thought the uber B Feldman was a genius scientist in charge of ressurecting puppet b? Now that the puppets are alive you see Robert's house has a hidden camera which a rival Toy company has planted to see if he would ever bring the puppets back. The evil owner of the rival company is Erica Sharpe (Vanessa Angel) who is bent on controlling the puppets. Now to add the even more b element is Vanessa Angel who you may remember from Wierd Science. No, not the movie but the early 90's tv series. There a well earned star right there. In order for her to control the puppets she must call upon her own pint sized creatures the Demonic Toys. These consist of a jack in the box clown, and teddy bear, and a baby doll with a truck drivers mouth. The baby is hilarious! He talks very much like a gruff well known midget actor who will remain nameless (another star earned) as he yells out things like ""shut up b***h."" In order to get the toys to do their evil deeds they make a pact with the devil who wants Robert's daughter sacrificed by sun up or else Vanessa will be banished to the underworld.

Now that the pact has been made Vanessa sends out a crew to kidnap the daughter and the puppets to bring to her headquarters. Once they abduct them Robert is notified that he must be escorted to the sacrifice if he wishes to see his daughter again. Once there he tells the puppets to awake and they bust out of their crate ready to kill. We now have an extremely b puppet/toy fight where they pulled out all the special effects Full Moon had to offer, which must have amounted to $7.50 tops. In the end we have the puppets as the victorious ones saving the world from the wrath of 3 killer toys.

As far as Full Moon goes this one's got it. It's there typical campy horror movie but so much fun to watch. It just screams a slot on tv around 2 in the morning. If you are thinking of checking this one out then you must know what to expect. The acting is bad especially from Corey Feldman who is pretending to be like a 50 year old guy, but changes nothing except putting a little grey color in his hair and talking with a scratchier voice. The special effects are nearly non exsitent and the one that are look hilarious. There are no scares but it's so entertaining watching these puppets run around it doesn;t matter. We fully recommend this one for a good time.",1223510400,4,4511,4.361474435196195
2431279,5,B000BO0KOQ,PUPPET MASTER VS. DEMONIC TOYS IS GOOD !!!! The demonic toys are verry terrible !!! And the puppet master are terrible to ! The movie is verry good and special !!,1208217600,,162,4.258064516129032
2431280,3,B000BO0KOQ,"Back when Fullmoon owned the rights to both movie franchises, it was originally planned that they would make a Puppet Wars mini-series back in the 1990's. Sadly the series idea was scrapped due to insufficient funds. Now that the Sci-fi Channel holds the right, they aired the ""long awaited cinematic showdown"" known as 'Puppet Master Vs. Demonic Toys'. Full Moon had nothing to do with the project. This is the third film in the Demonic Toys series and the 9th film in the Puppet Master series. The story takes place near Christmas eve, in which the Robert Toulon (great nephew of Andre Toulon) uses the reanimating fluid to revive the puppets we all know and love. What Toulon didn't know whas that he was being closely watched by a huge toy company. The head mistress of this highly popular toy company Erica Sharpe makes a deal with a demon from hell. The demon is hell bent on revenge and demands Toulon's blood. So Erica gets help from some well known Demonic Toys and plots to bring the entire toy line to life to spread innocent blood on christmas morning. So it's up to Robert and his gang of puppets to try and stop the evil madness.

Well first I would just like to say that im a big fan of both the Puppet Master and Demonic Toys movies, even though there were very few Demonic Toys movies. The last Demonic Toys movie just so happened to be 'Dollman Vs. Demonic Toys', which was just a big letdown. This movie is actually a letdown as well. This film was originally planned back in the 90's when Fullmoon brought up the idea of a mini-series. Well after a long wait the movie finally got made. Was it worth the wait? My answer would be yes and no. There were some things that I liked about this movie, but the bad really outweighs the good. I was mostly disappointed with this film and it was hard for me to take it seriously. From the characters, to the acting and even down to the look of the smaller evil characters. The idea of both movie franchises coming together really caught my attention and even had me pumped up to see it. I honestly didn't know what to expect and I'm really glad that I wasn't expecting it to be great or anything fantastic. What I found most entertaining was the acting from Corey Feldman. I couldn't help but laugh most of the time he talked, which was actually most of the movie. I found myself laughing at the little things that just weren't meant to be funny.

When I first found out that this would premiere on the Sci-Fi channel I knew right away that the movie would end up being low budget and corny. To no surprise I was correct. The acting in the film was off and at times the movements from the puppets looked cheap and fast. I happen to love cheesy flicks but seeing this film is just as fun as watching time fly by. Seeing the puppets and demonic toys on screen again was a neat pleasure though, but seeing them fight was a whole different story. For one the way the puppets and toys looked were kind of disappointing. I may sound picky for saying this but each of the puppets and toys used in this film were newly built and looked different. Its hard to describe the looks but its really noticeable, especially with the demonic toys. They just seemed to look less scary and evil (especially the toy bear, he looked more cute than threatening). The other thing that bothered me is the fact that they used only a few of the well known dolls in the movie. We get to see the puppets Blade, Pinhead, Chester and 6 Shooter. As for the evil toys we get to see Oopsidasy (baby doll), the teddy bear and that crazy Jack in the box. It was nice seeing them in a film together but I thought all the so called fight scenes were horrible and embarrassing. It makes sense knowing that this is a low budget feature, so it's not like you're going to see grade A fight sequences with the best special effects anyway.

I think it was a smart move to have this film premiere on the Sc-Fi channel. They really didn't have to cut out much because there is hardly any gore shown. There is some blood and gore, just not that much. Like a lot of low budget films this one definitely has its corny moments. Some of them were positives to me, I had a good laugh watching this movie and I did find some things entertaining. Sadly I found there to be more negatives than positives. The story could have been a lot better, but the way everything was put together was pretty decent. The demonic toy Oopsidasy is a hilarious character as always, using his ass more than once and saying those funny lines. That character was one of the highlights for me. The fight sequences between the puppets and toys were short and lame. You'd figure that they could've done a much better job with that aspect of the picture, especially since that's what the movie is based upon. Part of  reason why I wanted to see this film was to watch all the characters collide in a battle to the death. In the end I was disappointed with the outcome. Hell at least they gave the puppets a cyber upgrade, not to mention the DVD is pretty cheap so you can pick it up for a low price. But even then you really got to think hard about doing that.

Overall I thought this was a pretty bad movie. But if you don't take it too seriously then perhaps you will enjoy it more than I did. I honestly just couldn't take it seriously. The story could've been better, the acting is bad and I thought it was unimpressive. Sure it's low budget and im usually into those kind of films, but this one is pretty bad. If you enjoy watching really corny movies then I definitely recommend checking this out. I'm sure you'll have a laugh all the way through. If you're a fan of either the Puppet Master or Demonic Toys movies then you will very disappointed with this film. If you ever do plan on watching it then just rent it and don't expect anything great or fancy. Just grab a group of friends, make some popcorn and laugh your asses off.",1149033600,4,5920,4.349005424954792
2431281,5,B000BO0KOQ,"For those of us that were fortunate enough to watch the delicious demonic horror of the first Full Moon movies of the late 80s and early 90's, this DVD will remind us how brilliant the first few Puppet Master films were, or how devilish the first Demonic Toys film was. This movie captures all that lightning in a bottle, adds an extra dose of humor, and gift wraps the whole thing just in time for the holidays.

Featuring Corey Feldman as one of the decedents of Andre Toulon, who rediscovers 4 of the beloved Toulon puppets -Blade, Pinhead, Jester, and Six-Shooter, he reanimates them and sets about trying to protect them. But, the head of Sharpe toys, Erica Sharpe played by Vanessa Angel, has her own plans for both Toulon and his puppets as she plans to create an army of demonic toys on Christmas Day.

The animation of the dolls and puppets isn't as painstaking as it has been in the past, and the special effects are slightly sub-par, but the acting is brilliantly outlandish and the script his hilarious.

This was made for TV, so while there is some violence, there is minimal cursing and it's the most wholesome horror movie I have seen for quite some time. Yet, that wholesomeness does nothing to take away from the fun of the film.

So if you like full moon, if you like horror movies, if you want an alternative holiday film instead of It's a Wonderful Life, then this is your film, and a smart addition to your library for the money.

Highly recommended.",1147824000,7,1471,4.535849056603774

Having Cory doing anything is a bad ideal. Any ways Corey attempts to recreate the formula and bring the puppets back to life,all the while the head of a toy corporation has made a pact with the devil in hopes of bringing forth chaos and destruction on Christmas Eve the help of the formula. Naturally she attempts to steal the formula. Basically towards the end we get to finally see the lame match up between the toys. For some reason they decided to change the look of the original Demonic Toys but keep the same look of the Puppet Masters ones. Eithier way, the new look is horrible. Despite what attempt at horror they try to deliver, they come off simply as an annoyance. Probably the most intresting aspect of this dribble would be the upgrade they made to the Puppet master toys receive towards the end.

Much to my surprise, the resulting film was plenty entertaining. It doesn't make nearly enough of its premise and is a bit too goofy for my liking, though these faults are thoroughly out by an enthusiastic cast and a solid production. Sure enough, this one may yet appeal to fans of both franchises.

The story: A power-hungry CEO (Vanessa Angel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Weird-Science/dp/B000WGYM92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Weird Science</a>) in control of the murderous Toys attempts to take over the world via mass demonic possession - a plan which pits her against the newest Puppet Master (Corey Feldman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Goonies/dp/B000P0J09W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Goonies</a>) and his deadly charges.

Pitting the Puppets against the Toys is an intriguing clash of opposites. Both groups are deadly and diminutive, but the similarities stop there, with the Puppets being stoic servants who routinely switch between good and evil, whereas the Toys are rambunctious and solidly evil hell-spawn in the employ of a demon. A showdown between them should be awesome...but it's not quite. For one thing, all characters have been given fairly radical new designs that make them appear less threatening, (SPOILER) and the Puppets are further altered with cybernetic parts when they're damaged in a fire. And while they're all fairly active prior to their big showdown, the eventual fight is one-sided and disappointing.

Luckily, the human cast is at least as active as its plastic counterparts. While most of the major characters contribute favorably to the production, the most kudos go to Corey Feldman, who swoops in with a level of enthusiasm that particularly the ""Puppet Master"" flicks had been missing for a long time. Feldman's been given a script that more or less forces him to overact, but his charm and timing serve him well. He has excellent chemistry with his onscreen daughter (Danielle Keaton,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Darkening-Sky/dp/B005HP6QI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Darkening Sky</a>). Also welcome is Vanessa Angel as the villain, whose performance is just over-the-top enough to fit the film without getting on your nerves. The screenplay they're all working with is so tongue-in-cheek that it doesn't really match the tone of either franchise, but if you can overlook the scatological humor and sophomoric dialogue, it's commendable for featuring more action than the last three ""Puppet Master"" flicks.

The production values seem fairly strong: despite giving the impression of having been edited on an old&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/eMac/dp/B0009LZQWM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">eMac</a>, the entire film is bright and lively, with good puppetry and little reliance on CGI. I would love to see an updated version, featuring the original Puppet/Toy designs and more of an even battle between the two, but as is, ""Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys"" is a thoroughly acceptable experiment that I'll bet Full Moon is ashamed they couldn't create themselves.",1413676800,3,3735,6.631901840490798
8089950,4,B000BO0KOQ,It was a good movie if your looking for a comedy horror. It was very low budget. I liked it because of the comedy aspect of it.,1392854400,,127,3.740740740740741
8089951,2,B000BO0KOQ,"I know this is an unofficial sequel, and boy does it show. I can't believe Corey Feldman took a part in this. He must have been desperate for work at this time. I think this movie aired on syfi if I am not mistaken. I didn't see it on there, but picked up the DVD instead. I was disappointed in this film. The puppets don't even look like themselves anymore. The whole movie has a made for tv feel to it, not that the other ones are big budget tho. it just looks and feels a whole lot different. I can't really recommend this one, unless you have to see it, and want it to complete your collection. it's ok for a view, but I wouldn't want to see it again. Only recommend this one if you can get it at a cheap price. I sold this one, and I have the rest of the collection. that should tell you something. 2.3 out of 5",1381708800,,816,3.9515151515151516
