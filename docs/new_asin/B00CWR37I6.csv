8587007,5,B00CWR37I6,"This was a great series with plenty of useful tips from Emily and Stephan and I recommend the purchase of it. The verbal exchanges between them drastically increased the educational content. I really liked it and the lighter or shorter grapplers loved it. My daughters and her friends practiced everything on me. Oh what joy! This isn't something I'd purchase if you're new to BJJ if you don't have your basics ingrained as second nature. I'd start with the BJJ Roadmap download for FREE and purchase the inexpensive add-on. I prefer the BJJ Roadmap for beginners much better than the Roy Dean BJJ Blue Belt or No Gi, Gracie Combatives or other Grapplearts offerings for learning the basic concepts and techniques with or without a qualified instructor available. Many instructor neglect much of the information the Roadmap contains to well after a year. I'd work through the BJJ Roadmap with the paid add-on and get the big picture, basic positions and transitions down before commencing further if an instructor isn't available. Personally I think both methods are ideal. I've always instructed that way and found with that solid basic knowledge of the bigger picture the learning curve was much faster and easier. Personally started taking BJJ overseas in the 1980's.",1487980800,4,1270,5.052380952380952

8587009,5,B00CWR37I6,"I want to endorse Stephan and Emily in this excellent video they both produced. This is really a review about Emily's skill in teaching; she does a wonderful job of explaining basic no gi techniques of BJJ; however Stephen also does a wonderful job absorbing Emily's abuse courageously, and even adds constructive questions and comments interspersed through Emily's teaching technique. Bravo to both of you!",1442016000,2,407,5.276923076923077
8587010,5,B00CWR37I6,Simple and well explained techniques. I was able to pull off a knee bar  she demonstrated on someone that is very difficult for me to submit. Well worth the money.,1438041600,,163,4.433333333333334
8587011,5,B00CWR37I6,Useful. Especially seeing the demos from the different sized artists.,1433289600,,69,6.0
8587012,5,B00CWR37I6,"I have Emily Kwok's earlier DVD instructional with Kesting and her guard game and grappling style has always worked for me.  Kwok shows simple, effective techniques that totally work.  As one of the smaller practitioners in my school, I found her techniques to work even on my biggest training partners.",1433289600,3,303,5.04
