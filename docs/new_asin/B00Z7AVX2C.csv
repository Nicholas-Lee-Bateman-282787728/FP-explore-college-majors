7271220,5,B00Z7AVX2C,Great comedian!,1453593600,,15,7.0
7271221,2,B00Z7AVX2C,"I got this for my Dad, who has been a fan of Jonathan Winters from the beginning of Winters' career. He said it was a disappointment. This is NOT a ""best-of"" collection. Almost none of his great early stuff (such as his brilliant improvs - he practically invented the genre - with the stick, the pen & pencil set, etc)., nor his hilarious movie parodies (the prison break, the horror movie) are here. It's mostly skits with other performers & clips from his later career on the talk-show circuit. Winters was a comic genius but you wouldn't know it from this DVD. I just hope that someone will eventually reissue his albums on CD.",1452470400,5,630,4.535087719298246
7271222,3,B00Z7AVX2C,On the jacket it says the best of Jonathan Winters. This was not inclusive of his best and the fishing parts was outside what he is most famous for. It was okay to include but there was so much missing.,1446508800,8,202,4.075
8719571,1,B00Z7AVX2C,Really terrible piece of junk.  Jonathan must have been very hard up for money when he got talked into making this.  Glad I only paid $2.,1516320000,,137,4.230769230769231

8719574,5,B00Z7AVX2C,"I always enjoy Jonathan Winters, He's one of my favorites, he can impersonate on a whim with hilarious results.........:)",1502064000,,121,5.421052631578948
8719575,5,B00Z7AVX2C,Great gift.  Purchase as expected.,1483488000,,34,5.8
8719576,1,B00Z7AVX2C,What a waste of money. Not a single funny thing in this low budget rip off.,1471910400,,75,3.75
8719577,1,B00Z7AVX2C,Jonathan Winters is my all-time favorite which makes it all the more irritating to receive something like this. Do not purchase this item you will be disappointed. It is virtually nothing at all. It is the short film gone fishing made very late in his career. The classic clips that you think you are purchasing this item for last about a minute or two and are all cut from other TV shows and not even complete clips!,1471910400,3,417,4.428571428571429
