8662008,5,B00KVVP89G,"Gummi Tarzan 3D is worth viewing for the 3D enthusiasts;
as it is hilarious with a character like your next door neighbor's
kid that always comes to mischievous tricks and always
redeems himself soon after.
A truly good entertainment viewing that is if you are
not repeat are not glorifying other movies full of drug, booze,
perverted sex gratification.  Need to say that these days some
social media & some Internet sites are full of weirdos (even in
Australia an european born Monster Chef Psycho Gigolo murdered &
cooked his partner who was a Top High Class Asian Shemale).  So just
pick-up your ""Ivan The Terrible Gummi Tarzan 3D"" from Amazon
Dot Com and enjoy this CLEAN & FUNNY 3D",1412726400,,686,4.708333333333333
