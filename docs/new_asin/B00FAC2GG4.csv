8613782,3,B00FAC2GG4,"This was clearly a professionally recorded & broadcast show, however the transfer quality is a bit grainy. It's been encoded from what appears to be a VHS source.

I found this comment elsewhere and it sums it up well:

This is an excellent pro shot video. It includes the only performance of ""Beeswax"" after 1988, which was substituted for ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" at the last minute after Kurt got upset at the audience for throwing objects at the opening act, Calamity Jane. There are brilliant shots of all 3 members. The picture is clear throughout and is not likely to be higher then 2nd generation. The audio is very good but is a little muffled at times, it is also set to a fairly low volume on the DVD.",1402099200,5,713,4.476923076923077
