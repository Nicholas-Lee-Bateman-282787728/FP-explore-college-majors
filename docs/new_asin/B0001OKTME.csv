2023726,4,B0001OKTME,"I'm writing this review more as a response to an earlier review,  that I felt was inaccurate. I felt compelled to clarify, especially as someone who's seen the movie more recently than the 1980's. I did not buy the movie (but rather chose to rent it) based on the claim there was ""only 15-20 minutes of Clash footage and therefore it was not worth the price of the movie""  First off, the movie IS worth the price because of the Clash footage alone, EVEN in this age of YouTube. There is a beautiful, moving scene  with Mick Jones singing ""Stay Free"". He's in the studio, wearing headphones, and all you hear is his cracking voice.  (a similar scene with Joe as well) and scenes of Joe Strummer singing at the piano, alone, as well as amazing live Clash footage. Lots of it. The movie isn't great, it's a bit depressing in spots, a bit of a mess, really, but the Clash footage came around often enough, and hung around long enough and  was amazing enough, to make me want to go out and get the DVD afterall. And if you're a Clash fan, then I can't see you being disappointed with the footage either.",1223337600,4,1098,4.362745098039215
2023727,3,B0001OKTME,"It is ok , there is some good footage of the Clash early on , touring, but the rest is kinda pointless.  Ray G's character is annoying and the side story of blacks pickpocketing,, What is the point? the Clash did alot to address race issues without that little side show.  Watch it for the Clash footage only.",1203984000,,309,4.310344827586207
2023728,5,B0001OKTME,"Maybe 2 stars for the movie itself. I found the plot hard to follow. The scenes with acting are quite forced and insincere. The filmmakers tried to include a political tone - and i couldn't make much sense of it. Perhaps  I'll try to figure it out upon a second viewing.

The live performances, however, are electrifying. It is fortunate that The Clash have been documented live during this period  in their career. They were TIGHT. The most amazing part for me was the recording of ""All The Young Punks"" with Joe Strummer singing into the mic with headphones on. That part is simply breath taking.

I watched the BBC performances - also electrifying, but a bit polished - unlike the raw footage featured in the film.

If you are a major Clash fan, this is obviously a  must have.",1166140800,,780,4.535714285714286
2023729,3,B0001OKTME,"Most of these reviews are spot on - terrible movie, great music. However, from the details here, it seems the US version has been short changed - the English version also had a 7-song set from a German 1977 concert/student documentary film. That alone was worth the purchase price.",1159142400,2,281,4.755102040816326
2023730,5,B0001OKTME,"For some of us unfortunates, this was our first exposure to the awesome fire power of the Clash live. The movie isn't to bad either,Ray Grange plays a lazy drunk with right wing leanings trying to catch a ride on the rockin roller coaster. The Clash wise up and give him the boot. Of course the reason to own this is all the live and studio tracks, and the sound track has been upgraded and sounds great{even in 5.1 surround}.Includes 2 live tracks previously unreleased and extended scenes. Did i mention Interviews with Johnny Green,Ray Grange etc. Plus 2 live tracks from British television. P.S. Buy Lets Rock Again today].God bless JS!",1153353600,2,640,4.723214285714286

8016068,3,B0001OKTME,"Note; This review is for the VHS version of this movie. This poorly thought-out and executed film just seems so.....static. It has none of the energy of the original punk movement. Ironically enough the only musical counterpart this film might have would be the second Clash lp, ""Give Em Enough Rope"" which arrived stillborn. This movie feels like three separate stories edited together (riots in Brixton, roadying with The Clash, black pickpocket on trial),but instead of weaving the stories together it just feels ""random"". They should have just put out the live Clash footage. Speaking of which, here's what I learned about The Clash from this footage: Paul Simonon is a bad singer, Mick Jones seems a bit of a prima donna, Topper is a marvelous drummer and Joe Strummer seems like a really likable guy. The most interesting part for me is that as the movie progresses the band settle into their ""James Dean"" look with Mick Jones particularly shedding his curly locks and shirt w/vest look for something more traditionally ""punk"". You can see the band aiming for America and on the verge of ""making it"". People have noted that the lead character ""Ray"" seems pretty empty, but for me his character is one of the reasons punk ultimately failed; followers who didn't understand the original message. Too back the makers of this film can't go back in time and tidy it up a bit. There's promise here but it's buried beneath a ton of confusion. Worth watching as a period piece but hardly a good film.",1396137600,2,1498,4.787644787644788
8016069,2,B0001OKTME,"Amazon has once again hosed things up by combining two different films with the same name.

Biggs (Michael ""Bear"" Talaferro) is a big time crime boss. He sends his associate Rhino (John ""Ras Kidus"" Cornelius) to Jamaica to set up a drug deal. Wannabe Reggae singer Julius St John ( Mark Danvers) and hitman volunteers to be the mule. He tries to go honest, but almost as soon as he lands in America, his mother in Jamaica becomes ill, so he works for Biggs so he can send her money. This plot point drops from the picture and so does mom until 13 minutes from the end.  Meanwhile Julius meets and marries Shawnette (Anita Kopalz) in an badly conceived plot  point. We discover there is a poorly developed  gang war going on, and about half way through the film some cops are suddenly tossed at us who want Mr. Biggs.

Danvers is barely passable in his role, while the supporting cast was sad. Talaferro spoke in ridiculous whispers  throughout the film while Rhino was the mad hatter. The Jamaican scenes were subscripted.  The twist at the end had more holes than a single man's10 year old  sock.

It could have been worse

8016070,1,B0001OKTME,"I gave this a chance in the early 2000's, and I am sorry that I did so. Part drama, part documentary, part concert, whoever created this movie had a confused vision. Scenes that do not tie in, bad filming, and boredom are the pain that you will experience if you choose to view it. One cannot empathize or identify with the main ""character"" at all because of all the wrong turns. Hey, I like the Clash, but they didn't need to do this movie in order to enforce their audible genius. I know that I will be looked down upon for my opinion, but I gotta go with the truth. Watch Depeche Mode's ""101"" instead.",1366761600,,604,4.260869565217392
8016071,4,B0001OKTME,"...if you watch this as a movie, you'll be disappointed as it's not strong that way. The concert footage is excellent however and totally captures the feel of the Clash at that point in their career. It also provides a nice snapshot of their personalities and growth as a band (even during the course of the film). It's not bad either at giving you a feel for just how messed the UK was at the time and makes it easier to understand how the Brits (in their desperation for change) elected Thatcher. All in all, good not great, but definitely worth watching!",1243728000,,557,4.470588235294118
8016072,5,B0001OKTME,"I first saw this film in 1980 and not again until now, 28 years later.  I loved it!  The concert footage is fantastic and there is a lot more of it than I remembered.  What struck me was the accurate rendition of 1970s Britain, mostly forgotten nowadays. Young people today have no idea of how easy things have been for them in their lives, in comparison to the youth of that era.  Watching the film puts the songs of The Clash into perspective.  If you are a Clash fan, or just curious about this time, this is a must-have film for your collection!",1225584000,4,549,4.29126213592233
