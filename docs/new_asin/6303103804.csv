7838256,4,6303103804,"this has been a funny movie very good entertainment from the day it was released I will be entertained by this movie well into the future
I would recommend this movie to all those people out there that liked ABBOTT and COSTELLO movies
  fantastic  stuff",1435190400,,253,4.5777777777777775
7838257,2,6303103804,"I wish I could have been on the set when Costello and the mountain witch (Margaret Hamilton from The Wizard of Oz) face off and repeatedly jab pins into each other's voodoo doll. This is a rather weak film, but it's livelier than some A & C outings and the ending gag involving gold is a delight. You might say that ""Park Avenue Hillbilly"" Dorothy Shay sings too often, but the songs are amusing, and you will hear Abbott try to convince Costello that he and a 10-year-old girl will eventually be the same age.",1269648000,,510,4.378947368421053
7838258,3,6303103804,"The film begins with a comic song for cafe, society. The Great Wilbert pops up on stage. He is a magician who escapes from his chains. Wilbert may be the heir to a buried treasure back in Kentucky. So they return to the land of the Winfields and the McCoys. [Was this the inspiration for 'The Beverly Hillbillies'?] Dorothy sings another comic song. There is a funny skit about target shooting. Conflict over the results restart a feud. [This tells about popular culture of that time.] How many can share one bed? Wilbert learns about their marriage customs. Can love be created by a potion? ""Voodoo."" ""Who do?"" There is a joke about drinking that potion. Can a marriage end a feud between families?

The staged conflict goes on and leads to comedy at the old mine shaft. There is a quick and forced end to this drama. Did a need for money force Abbott and Costello into overexposure by too many films? [This is one film that seems less funny than when I first saw it.]",1201478400,,969,4.47457627118644
7838259,2,6303103804,"I agree that this film has some fine gags in it, but it moves with the pace of a vaudville show.  Bud and Lou will have a scene, then Dorothy Shay will sing a song, the Bud and Lou, the Dorothy........and so on and so on of about 75 minutes.  It isn't an awful film, it just doesn't live up to the standards the boys set for themselves.  For the most part they had grown out of this sort of pacing by around 1946, and this film seems to set them back quite a few steps.  It took a few films before they'd find their stride again.",980467200,,529,3.9158878504672896
7838260,5,6303103804,"As with most A&C films, this one included humor which can only be found in their movies. Being one of my favorites, ""Comin' Round the Mountain"" will have you laughing until your side hurts. It has a good  story as well, laced, however, with many DUMB songs. I suppose having five  or six singing pieces in a comedy was supposed to be popular back then, but  it starts to get on your nerves after a while. I guess that's what they  made the fast forward button for.
It's a very good one, however, and  remains my favorite to this day. The funniest part would have to be the  Voodoo gag in which the dialogue is as follows:
Costello: ""What's  she doing?""
AbbotT: ""She's making Voodoo""
Costello:  ""I do?""
Abbott: ""Voodoo!""
Costello: ""I do  what?""
It's full of laughs!",956880000,6,764,4.478260869565218

7838262,3,6303103804,"This could've and should've been one of A&C's funnier movies but whenever things get moving Dorothy Shay starts singing and the movie grinds to a halt. At least Costello mugs his way through most of the songs. The  voodoo doll scene is by far the funniest and the scene where the  hillbillies crawl into bed with Lou is a hit. Definitely worth a look for  fans, but the songs are hard to endure.",942969600,7,395,4.383561643835616

Fast forward to the scene of Costello and country witch Margaret Hamilton (a real departure from her previous role in Wizard of Oz). They have a  hilarious battle of Dueling Voodoo Dolls, with Abbott just scratching his  head in bewilderment. Simply the Best!!!",926812800,2,315,4.9245283018867925
