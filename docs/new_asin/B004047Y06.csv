4238611,5,B004047Y06,"I first found this series as an ad on one of my favorite webcomics, and investigated after I found out it was created by the same people who did Ikki Tousen. While not a show for young children, I would definitely recommend this show to any mature adult or teenager looking for a harem anime. It is quite funny",1291334400,,310,4.271186440677966
4238612,5,B004047Y06,"I first became a fan of this series after I started reading the manga a few years ago and I still stay up to date on its releases. Then I watched season 1 and counted the days till season 2 and have watched both seasons multiple times and as a fan of the manga 1st I can tell you that the 1st season doesn't disappoint. They managed to stay truer to the main story in the manga than most anime's do. Other than the changes they made in the final episode to wrap up the season its pretty spot on. And those changes don't change much overall in the story. Sure, they skip some things but if you haven't read the manga don't fret all key moments in the story are in there and you won't feel like your missing out on anything.

I tell my friends who I try to get into Sekirei that it's just so outrageously over the top in every aspect you cant help but love it. They do a great job mixing in exciting action and some sexy scenes while keeping the creative story and the comedy at the forefront of the show. The diverse characters suck you in and your stuck for the ride~ It's a must watch for any comedy/action fan and I personally have been waiting for something of Sekirei to be released for English speaking fans to collect other than toys and will definitely be getting this, even tho I personally won't be watching it dubbed, I'll only be watching it subbed :P

Hope this helped some of you out there :)

4238654,3,B004047Y06,"This series is something I wanted to see for a long time, that's why I bought it. The other reason I bought it is because I wanted to watch it while I did work and those sort of things. Usually I don't mind sub anime, but when I watch them I have to put all my attention into it. and nothing else, so when I saw this blue ray was dubbed I got excited and bought it, unfortunately the product description lied. This item is all sub. I fully expect to love this series but despite that, I have to give this item a mediocre score because the item description lied.",1520035200,6,561,4.063063063063063

I have only ever watched this series on Hulu, so it is very cool to finally be able to watch a good quality version of the final episode of To Love Ru Darkness 2. For whatever reason, that episode was not included on Hulu. My only complaint about this set is that the OVAs are not included. There are actually quite a few OVAs too. There are several characters that are introduced during the OVAs and when the following series picks up, it acts as if we've encountered these characters before and know what they're all about. I still have no clue how Nana and Momo arrived onto the scene. Despite this, it is great to have this set and the episodes play very well.",1513641600,,717,4.240875912408759

4238830,5,B004047Y06,"Welcome back! I'm glad you're reading this review for Sekirei season 1! please enjoy!!

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers only) Minato Sahashi is a 19 year old student who fails out out of his college exams and isn't very good with women either, so when he is leaving the college a girl falls onto him, litterly she rockets out of the sky and kisses him on the lips, her name is Musubi (the girl shown on the dvd cover). She tells Minato she is a Sekirei, a person created to surve their master (the first person they kiss) and must fight other people with Sekirei's in order to win. Her number is 88, which is her creation number and her strength level. (further explaintion, the lower the number the stronger the sekirei is). Over the next few days a man called Hiroto Minaka comes over the whole city saying he is the rich person who created the Sekirei's and everyone who has one is now in his new game! A last Sekirei standing fight.  So now Minato and Musubi now go on an adventure to find other Sekirei's and play (agents their will) in a survival match. So now Stage 1 let all of the Sekirei out to find masters. Once 90% of the Sekirei have found a master its time for Stage 2 fight! every single time a Sekirei and their master meet another person who has a Sekirei now must fight each other till one is defeated then are out of the game!

Pros: this is a fan service anime with a good plot and some awesome action scenes, is you can get past the fan service part of the show its very entertaining to say the least!

Cons: other than some inapproateness in the show there really isn't anything bad to report

Over All: its a short first season only 12 episodes, but they are good! BUY THIS SERIES!!!!

Side Note: also please read my review for the second season of this show also please!",1432166400,,1800,4.310650887573964

4238832,5,B004047Y06,"Good Anime series, but definitely NOT for children or anyone under the age of 18. I like it, but has a lot of the standard characteristics for most of the female characters: Large chests, not so much clothing, and quite a bit of chest and panty shots. It is an Anime and it does have nudity in it. Other than  those things, it can be pretty funny, but this is not something you want to watch around children or under the age I mentioned above.",1424822400,4,443,4.211764705882353

4238852,5,B004047Y06,One of the best anime series.  The animation and voices are solid.  Each female character is well developed and likeable.  The male character is NOT annoying - which is rare for anime.  You will find yourself caught up in the story and characters.,1407369600,,247,4.674418604651163

4238857,5,B004047Y06,Next to the Ghost in the Shell' this is my favorite series.  To bad only two seasons are available.  The graphics and story are excellent and the characters are fun.  Lots of personality here with just the right amount of a seriously evil underlayment.  Go Sekirei's-especially the drunk one-I think a dated her in a previous life.,1394409600,,331,4.754385964912281
4238858,5,B004047Y06,"Yes, this series is a fairly typical harem comedy anime.  The girls are busty and seem to have clothing that shreds far too easily and the plot holes are only slightly larger than you typical supercarrier.

However, Sekirei manages to be fun despite its flaws.  The characters are interesting, diverse and manage to make you car.  The hero isn't nearly as wimpy as most even if 99.9% of the women could pound him into the turf with ease, and the villain while as usually having motives that appear to make little sense, is just plain fun.

This proives to be one of the few recent animes that I really enjoted.  Good fun.",1384646400,,621,4.5
4238859,5,B004047Y06,"Even though it was a lot of the typical stuff in these types of anime, I just loved it. There is a couple things that I thought that they did a great job on. First, the show went through seamlessly. What I mean by that is that they kept the show going where you could not wait to see what happened next. They constantly through in new things, and, even on these short type of season shows, they did not have any filler type of shows in this. Some shows make you go through a filler type of show where you would not miss anything if that episode was missing, or you keep feeling like ""get to the point already"" type of episodes. This one had none. There was a point and an accomplishment that added to the show in every episode, and I think that is what made it really good. If I had any complaints, it would be a short first season, but at least they through in an OVA in the last disk in the special features, but that was a filler, just for fun type of episode. I just ordered season 2 and cant wait.",1383523200,,1002,4.040201005025126
4238870,4,B004047Y06,"I wasn't sure what I was getting into with this anime but I was looking for something with tough chicks who kick some serious butt! I got that but I also got a welcomed bonus. ""Top heavy"" action along quite a bit of naked-ness!

I still think ""High School Of The Dead"" is a better series but not by much. And like ""HSOTD"" it is a short series, with only 12 episodes a season, but this show has 2 seasons and i'm looking forward to season two. Should be good!",1381968000,,458,4.088888888888889

Basically, the main character is a mild-mannered dorky guy who doesn't have a job or go to college and thinks his life is headed nowhere. Suddenly, a gorgeous young woman with big boobs falls out of the sky and stays with him. What's not to like? I mean...seriously... :)",1373241600,,415,4.621621621621622

4238945,4,B004047Y06,"I didn't buy Sekirei on Amazon, instead, I watched it on Watch Instantly from Netflix (which I reccomend, if you have a Netflix account). I'm an anime fan, not as big as one compared to other people, but I've become familiarized with the medium, after watching various series for a few years now. So before I review the story, I'll tell about what kind of anime this is. Sekirei is obviously targeted towards guys, a real pervy anime, having nudity and innuendos in every episode (which is probably suited for 17+). Most of its traits are nothing original, nose bleeds, jiggles, panty shots. This could be sub-catagoried as a Harem anime as well. With all of this, I still found Sekirei pretty fun and engaging to watch.

Minato is feeling like a loser, he just failed the entrance exam at a college, and is barely living at his apartment. Then one day Masubi lands on him, after falling from the sky. He soon lerns that she is a Sekirei, an other-worldy warrior maiden set loose in the city. The Sekirei have special powers, one of them which if they kiss a male, he becomes their Ashikabi, a soul mate of sorts they are bound to forever. So this is what happens to Minato, he becomes Masubi's Ashikabi, and gets kicked out of his appartment, ending up living in a tennate house, who's residents may not be just normal ladies.

So Sekirei isn't a bust, yeah, it has some female bustyness in it, but it isn't a failure. The first episode hooked me, making me interested in continuing watching it. The first season has about 12 or 13 episodes. It isn't a long season, which I like. Some anime seasons (like Bleach) last forever. Some people like that, but for me, I like shows that are good, but don't take a lot of my time. The first few episodes mostly introduce the characters, and the main story behind the plot is developed through out the season.

Skekirei, ultimately, is a guy anime. That doesn't bother me, but it just has many things we've all seen before. However, it still works for the type of genre it is, and I enjoyed it. I'm excited to see the second season.",1353283200,,2074,4.496021220159151
4238946,4,B004047Y06,"This is just a typical harem anime that covers most of the stereotypes that come with that genre. What sets this apart is the amazing fight scenes. Next to Yu Yu Hakusho they are my favorites. The humor is hit or miss. The animation is hit or miss as well. During the fight scenes it is a big hit, other than that the quality is questionable.",1351987200,,342,4.196969696969697
4238947,5,B004047Y06,"I got to say that I loved Sekirei! Got both seasons on blu-ray after I had bought the first one on dvd because I enjoyed it that much and can't wait for a season 3. It's got great fighting,humor,and story to it. It's the story and love between the main characters that I enjoyed the most. The main male character is a little wimpy but he has balls and heart. The main female character is sweet,sexy,determined,devoted, and kicks butt. I won't go into details about the story because I enjoyed it even more by not knowing anything about it. Queen's Blade & Claymore were my first 2 anime series that I ever saw and I loved those as well,not knowing anything about them but the cover art.

4238948,5,B004047Y06,"I bought Sekirei for no reason other than boredom. I'm glad I was bored that day. I discovered something great. Sekirei may appear like a mindless bouncy boobs anime, but it's not. There's a really cool story with lots of awesome characters, fights and bouncy boobies. Minato is a regular guy. One day a beautiful girl named Musubi falls out of the sky and on top of him. She kisses him and he becomes in a game called the Sekirei Plan. Over 100 people with special powers, called Sekirei, must find a master and fight each other to the finish. The losers are separated and the winners get to stay together forever. Minato eventually attracts 5 more Sekirei's and the game is on.

This anime is visually impressive and fun. There are tons of awesome characters that are naked most of the time. Even with all this eye candy and comedy there is a strong bond of love that forms between Minato and his 6 Sekirei's. This is one of the most fun new animes out there. It's definitely one to miss.",1350518400,,990,4.43956043956044

But I was most pleasantly surprised.

The story has slowly been coming along. In the first season it isn't as important as the introduction of characters, but it is there. Most of this season has been our main character adjusting to his new circumstances. As the season progresses, the background, the history, the ""big picture"" begins to be painted.

The characters, ah, that's the best part. The first male and female characters are pretty well developed from the beginning, but other characters have come along and been developed. These have been the most pleasant of surprises. I've watched outwardly strong characters develop a softer, gentler, vulnerable side. I've watched gentle characters develop strength, resolve and bravery. All the while strengthening their bonds with one another.

The fan service is still there, but as the season goes on, it becomes more like background noise. I looked beyond it because I wanted to see how the story turns out.",1349913600,,1054,5.182352941176471

4238976,4,B004047Y06,"This anime is a story about Sekirei's and their Ashikabi's, and their forced to participate in game called "" The Sekirei Plan "".

We start of with the protagonist Minato, who fails his college examinations twice, but he's a lot smarter then he actually thinks. On his way from his examination, a girl named Musubi falls from the sky and lands on him in a most, how should I say... ecchi way. Minato happens to be Musubi's Ashikabi. An Ashikabi is a Sekirei's chosen one, and this contract is concluded when they kiss which emerges the Sekirei, their full potential is released. Minato is the center of this typical anime harem with a bunch of Sekirei's interested in him, some of them constantly fight over him in pretty comical ways.

Now the the Sekirei plan is a tournament hosted by the organization called MBI where all the Sekirei's must duke it out in an all out war, and the battleground for this fight takes place in a city. There are 108 Sekirei's and each one have incredible abilities ranging from magic/powers to superman strength, and a wide variety of martial arts, although it is a little less on the action in contrast to the comedy. The Sekirei's search for their Ashikabi's in hopes of further increasing their abilities and winning the game. Also the Sekirei's are always loyal to their Ashikabi's and will even put their own life on the line to protect them, I can't exactly say the same thing about the Ashikabi's, some are abusive and power hungry people who think their invincible since they have powerful beings with them, since the Ashikabi's don't have any powers of their own, they like to exploit this.

The Story: Sekirei has a lot of fan service, but manages to balance character and story elements within it's 12 episodes. The manga version of this is pretty close to the anime, but in a little more detail with the concept. The humor is really is for the older audiences, 17+ I would say, since it has a lot of innuendo and I mean a lot, but nothing to serious though, no sex scenes( then again what anime does have that), mostly just huge boobs and panty shots and brief nudity. I would recommend this to anyone who wants good comedy and action.

The Quality: The Blu-Ray version is 720p-1080p and it's pretty top notch, exceptional detail in quality and color, the picture can't get any better than this. DVD is your standard 480p quality and dosen't look half bad at all depending on the size of your TV.

The Audio: Dolby TrueHD: English 5.1. It offers English and Japanese dubs, both which sound good, Funimation did a good job with the English cast. As a preference I listen to the English dubbing.

Features: OVA - Kusano's first shopping trip ( OVA is an extra episode).

4238979,4,B004047Y06,"Let me set the record straight and tell you that FUNimation's marketing for this gem of a show is completely idiotic. If you were to listen to its double entendre-laden summary on the package, or watch any of the trailers, you'd think it was idiotic exploitation with no artistic merits whatsoever. Once again, this proves the company's complete inability to market something that has risque elements to it. Listening to the way they describe this series, it sounds like a ridiculous farce on the same level as ""Heaven's Lost Property."" What surprised me most about ""Sekirei"", however, is its earnest attempt to tell a compelling story underneath all of the fan service.

Minato Sahashi comes from the ""Love Hina"" vein of anime protagonists: young, decently attractive, and a total academic failure. Much like shows of that type, a bevy of beautiful women start crowding around him, most notably the busty and powerful Musubi, who is the show's charming, unique love interest. But this show eschews the typical perverted high jinks, outside of some bath scenes and ""boy walks in on girl changing"" moments, for an intriguing, fight-oriented plot. See, Musubi is what is known as a Sekirei, which are powerful superhuman beings capable of incredible feats. In order to fully unleash her power, however, she needs what is known as Ashikabi, which is a handler of sorts that a Sekirei forms a spiritual bond with. How is the bond formed? Why, with kissing, of course!

All silliness aside, this concept is surprisingly pliable. The Sekirei are competing in a government game to see which one is the strongest, and thus, many of the Sekirei are desperately seeking Ashikabi to boost their power. Others are hopelessly enslaved by rich, spoiled Ashikabi, who only want to win the game for power and recognition, abusing their Sekirei in order to get what they want. Seeing how different individuals handle this newfound power and status makes for some compelling entertainment, due to the distinct contrasts between Minato and some of the other, lesser Ashikabi. It adds a solid human element to the series, one that other fighting-focused ecchi shows could learn a thing or two from.

But despite the tinge of humanity, this is still a show that emphasizes on two things: fighting and mammary glands. The first of these two things is done surprisingly well. Each Sekirei has different powers and wicked martial arts abilities, and with the excellent animation, battles never devolve into plodding ""Naruto""-esque bouts. The combat is actually very reminiscent of ""Queen's Blade"", another excellent fan-service show, in the sense that it's always engaging and keeps you wanting more. Throughout this first season, the fighting was always conservatively placed and never tiresome. Given some of the other shows featuring similar content, this is definitely a feat in and of itself.

Worth noting to this critic, though, is the fan service itself. I know, it seems kind of weird to praise a show for its handling of titillation, but ""Sekirei"" does it so well that it definitely deserves special note. This series is never coy or teasing with its fan service, instead opting to shove the nudity in your face whenever it sees fit. This makes for an overall more honest experience, breaking it free from the confines of a ""tee-hee, look, BOOBIES!"" teen sex comedy. Having the actual nudity put on display shows that the animators were aiming for an older male crowd as opposed to an adolescent crowd of snickering tween boys, and that definitely gives it some extra clout in my book.

That's not to say the show is perfect, however; after all, this type of anime rarely is. The biggest issue with ""Sekirei"" is its unevenness with the pacing and tone of the overall story arc. At one moment, we're expected to bust a gut laughing at a comedic misunderstanding, and then a few minutes later, the show throws an emotional curveball at us. While it is true that art should not be faulted for attempting to encompass a wide range of emotions, I did feel that the show couldn't settle on what it wanted to be and thus decided to be a little bit of everything. When this works, it's beautiful, but when it doesn't, it comes across as a bit uneven. That being said, the characters are all quite unique and multi-faceted, and you shouldn't be shocked if you become emotional during some of the more intense scenes. By the end of series, you'll definitely have some heavy investment in one or two of the characters.

""Sekirei"" is a strong show that, against all odds, is one of the most and entertaining anime I've seen in a long while. With a strong dub, great animation, and a pleasantly breezy soundtrack, it makes for not only some fine Summer viewing, but fine viewing for anytime of the year. At this price, it's a complete steal for a show that will definitely leave some sort of impression on you.

I really think it's the character's interactions that make this so entertaining. The nice think is how the hero, at first, sort of stumbles into forming ties with various Sekirei over the series. He only does so when pushed or it occurs by accident and when forced to put them in harms way, he is very slow to do so. Also, the every day interactions are really fun to watch, especally since his landlady is really quite scary. (You learn why as the series continues.)

I went into this 100% never-say-die ""I'm probably not going to like this"". Truthfully, the only reason I even started is because a reference to it got to the frontpage of Funnyjunk - A picture sharing site.

I am so glad I gave it a chance. Our star is a guy whom most of us from the internet can relate to: Shy, quiet, can be smart if we need to be (ha), and if twin girls wielding lightning bolts headed our way we'd tuck tail and run. It is honestly refreshing to see. The characters are all lovable, they make you laugh at times and make you feel at times, a good balance. If you can get past the ""Oo0oo00hh! Look BOOOOOBS!""

The plot doesn't matter, because it has too many holes to really stand up on its own. All you need to know is right there on the cover. This anime is about big breasted women. There is nudity and there is innuendo, however no real sexual content. The main character builds his harem out of several fighters each seemingly more busty then the last (if that's possible) and they all ""want"" him for themselves - yet he's not really man enough to take advantage of his situation. Some of the fight scenes are quite good, and the Funimation english voice actors as usual do a good job. I particularly like the very proper speaking blond and the extremely busty drunk. At times it is very cute and light hearted and other times very dire and tense when the stakes are raised and some of the characters die.

That main draw obviously being fan service, as there is lots of it. But the action is actually pretty good. This series isn't terribly original, but it is very entertaining to watch. genre wise it is very comparable to high school of the dead. The animation isn't the highest youll see. But it is better than the average anime, with some well choreographed fights and vibrant colors. I haven't seen what it looks like on blu-ray, but I assume it looks much like season 2, which is a good thing.

And I must say that both series are amazing.  you would think despite the lovely lady on the cover and how they put the description from the back that this is a story full of nothing but attractive men and women beating on each other until their clothes are gone showing their assets - you are partially right, but under it all there is a great story, memorable characters (besides the obvious) and non stop action and humor (even when things get serious).

Our hero, Minato, is the typical nice shy guy, so much so he never has much chances with the ladies, but that changes when out of the sky a bouncy, beautiful girl literally falls on him, smothering him with her chest.  She is on the run from a twin set of sisters who can shoot lightning from their hands, but when the two kiss Musubi gains special power to drive off the assialants.  This is just the beginning as Minato learns of a dark orginization who is trying to determine the next step of human evolution and using these powerful warriors called Sekirei's to choose it, with the winning Sekirei and master getting whatever wish they desire.  As the two begin their journey, they are joined by other bouncy ladies all wanting Minato to turn on their ""special"" desires.  Can Minato survive dinner, let alone the tournament?

As I said, this series is full of everything, but definately not child friendly (HIgh nudity and fan service). But give it a shot if you are a fan if Ikki Tousen or looking for something a little different in you anime titles.

4239001,5,B004047Y06,"What do you get when you combine Pokmon with the best aspects of anime ecchi and harem? Sekirei, of course. The basic story, as others have said, revolves around Minato, your typical ronin student, who is pretty much hopeless in just about everything that he does, despite being highly intelligent, because he cannot deal well with stress. On his way home after failing for the second time to pass the entrance exam for college and having his allowance cut in half by his mother, Musubi literally falls on top of him. It turns out that she is one of 108 Sekirei, each of whom has their own special superpowers.  Sekirei are often referred to by their number, with lower numbers usually having greater power than higher numbers. These powers, however, can only be fully unlocked by a special person (call Ashikabi) destined to be the Sekirei's lifelong master. This process is called being winged by the Sekirei and means being kissed by their Ashikabi. Over the course of the first season, Minato wings Kusano (#108), Matsu (#02), and Tsukiumi (#08, my personal favorite), in addition to Musubi (#88). After being winged, all are in love with Minato and fight over who can serve him the best. One of my favorite ongoing gags in the series is the race between Musubi and Tuskiumi over who can return first from a grocery shopping trip, which Tuskiumi always loses. The winner gets to sit by Minato and help feed him dinner. The extra OVA included in the DVD is a shopping race with Kusano as a participant. The anime has good artwork, funny dialogue, characters that you can care about, and just enough sexual innuendos to make things interesting, but do not detract from the show. As the story progresses, Minato learns about the ""Sekirei Plan."" It is fight for survival among Sekirei and Ashikabi until the last one remains. For those familiar with the manga, the first season is pretty faithful to it. That is not the case with the second season (Sekirei: Pure Engagement) which is also available on DVD/Blu-ray.  This anime is a lot of fun and should be seen as such. As with many harem oriented amine, there is a hint of sexual antics, but nothing ever happens. In fact, anytime the sexual heat gets too high for Minato, he has a nosebleed, which seems to be a constant in these types of anime. (If anyone can explain why nosebleeds, I'd be grateful.) Winging means being kissed. Thus, when Minato wings Kusano, who is around 8 years old, he just kisses her. Kusano wants to be Minato's wife, as do all of his Sikirei, but only when she grows up. The series has a TV-MA rating, but I cannot see how it would offend anyone over the age of 16. If you like your anime fun, fast, and furious, then I think that you will like Sikirei.

Still, it pushes things a bit! There is the over-arching story of a city being ruthlessly controlled by a corporate Police State; not a government, but a megacorporation that soared to power after its founder discovered a hidden technology on a remote island.

But there is another part to the story: that of the BONDS of LOVE that can cause people to reach so deeply, and call so urgently upon their strength in order to protect those bonds, that something BRAND NEW can emerge -- something wonderful!

Even the WINGED (emerged) Sekireis are subject to all the usual frailties ... jealosy, selfishness, wickedness; but the BIRDS of LOVE, as they are called, will teach and learn about love ... as ordained by the Sekirei of Fate.

As usual, the question looms: ""What will prevail? The disasters brought about by human shortcomings, or that which lies on the other side of the BONDS of LOVE? And are the Sekireis and their Masters willing participants in the GREAT GAME (The Sekirei Plan), or are they helpless pawns, subject to the whims of a power-mad meglomaniac?

You decide; but the girls are lovely, the action is great, and the story ... well, after watching through season 2 ...

Season one is probably the better of the two seasons. Season two doesn't really expand much and it starts to fall back on traditional harem comedy bits. Its definitely worth a watch. But that doesn't mean its perfect. The art style, takes time to get used to. Women are without a doubt the worst drawn. Bodies are either completely out of proportion or full of odd angles. You can tell it's the artist's style but it is distracting because it takes away from the characters. It is a shame because the rest of the series is drawn well but when it comes to women its like they are very amateurish. But thats likely the only downside you might find in this.

4239007,4,B004047Y06,"When the cover of a anime DVD have the word boobs written all over you know what you are getting, and Sekirei do indeed deliver boobs. This anime is what I would call fan service with a plot, and as such it is very good. Sekirei is a rather typical magic girl/harem anime, the main character is a wimpy teenager who accidentally get involved with the Sekirei plan. Now Sekirei are men and woman with supernatural powers who are pitted against one another to fight until only one remain. Now these Sekirei, if they can find special people of, typically of the opposite gender and kiss them then they form a bond with this person and their powers become more powerful, are you seeing where this is going yet? Good so is everyone who have ever read manga or watched anime before. Our main protagonist are off course one of these magical kissers called Ashikabi and he attracts a group of Sekirei who off course falls in love with him.

You are not going to find anything new in this series, it have all been done before, but Sekirei takes this true and tried method and dos it very well. The animation is beautiful, the characters are interesting, the fight scenes are well choreographed. Sekirei also do something well which many do wrong and that is phasing, the story moves along nicely and there is a good balance between action scenes and drama.

Now I could not talk about this show without mentioning the fan service, for there is allot of it. This is the kind of anime which really do not have that many panty shots for the simple reason that the characters spend so much time naked that there are no panty to shoot. In every fight someone's cloths are being ripped off, and when the girls are not fighting and thereby getting naked they are sitting in the bath talking. I however do not mind the fan service here as the show clearly states this is what it is about. This is fan service with a plot. Everything in this anime is made to be an excuse to show naked, animated boobs. Now if you have a regular show, especially one who try to be serious and all you have is fan service (I am not mentioning any names but I am looking at you High School of the Dead) then that can get annoying, here you know what you are getting and the show do not hide what it is. If you hate fan service do not get this show plain and simple, the box even warns you that there will be boobs. But if fan service is what you are looking for or you just want a good story and a bit of fun then the fan service in this sort of just fit in with the whole.

I love the story in Sekirei, it is perfect for what the show is trying to be, it is not exactly Lein, it is not trying to be deep, but it is fun, involving and it kept me wanting to put on the next episode to see what happens. Sekirei is also a good beginner anime I think as the storyline is fairly straight forward, without the often rather strange twist and turns typical to anime. This series also do have an ending, though the ending feel more like the end of a season than the end of a series so hopefully there will be more Sekirei anime in the future.

As for Sekirei have a good opening theme, it is a little to generic, but I watched the intro to most of the episodes as I liked the song. There is two ending themes, and I did not really care for any of them. I am not really a music critic though so what do I know, you might like the ending themes, I found them incredible bland, tough the second one is better than the first.

In conclusion I loved this show, it is a light hearted, fun romp, the story is interesting and the animation is great, however there are loads and loads of fan service so your opinion on that really is what determines if Sekirei is worth getting or not. If you like or tolerate fan service then I think you will enjoy Sekirei for it is really quite good.",1296259200,2,3832,4.186991869918699
4239008,4,B004047Y06,"As with just about every anime series ever, there are good things about Sekirei, and there are bad things. In Sekirei's case, though, the good things far outweigh the bad.

For the uninitiated, Sekirei revolves around a battle royale of sorts, centering around 108 super-soldiers fighting for ultimate supremacy. There's more on the line than just bragging rights, though: The winner of the entire tournament, along with their Ashikabi (contract partner), will gain entrance into heaven, where they can stay for all eternity. The rest... will die in the process.

The premise seems tired and cliched at first: voluptuous ladies fighting amongst themselves for the affection of a particular male. However, this series gives the cliche some welcome twists. An Ashikabi does not have to stick with just the one Sekirei that he ""wings"" (in this series, ""winging"" refers to the Ashikabi unlocking the Sekirei's true powers. How is this done? How else? A kiss.) Rather, one Ashikabi can ""wing"" multiple Sekirei, forming a battle harem of sorts. You can see that coming from a mile away, and the protagonist Minato does indeed start building up his harem in a hurry.

In spite of the harem cliches obviously present, the series excels in other areas. The combat scenes are fast-paced and always pleasing. The fan-service is definitely there, though not in the amount present in anime like Green Green et. al; in other words, there's enough to please, but not enough to turn a majority of anime viewers off from it. Another thing I liked about the series, is that the creators didn't fall back on the old trope of having -all- of the fighters be female; at least one of the Sekirei- Homura- is a full-blooded male, which adds some more well-needed variety to the series. (As a side note, Homura's story alone is worth watching. If the Sekirei story were nothing but Homura, I'd still watch it.)

Aside from the whole harem thing, there's really only one problem I had with the series, and it has to deal with one of the Sekirei that Minato ""wings."" Kusano is only eight or nine years old, and it kind of disturbed me to think that a girl as small and innocent as her would even be in a series like this, much less having to be ""winged"" by someone who could potentially be arrested for something like that. I guess it's her age that disturbs me, the most. *shrugs*

I won't say anything else about the series itself, but I will say this: The manga goes a lot further than the anime does; the anime will take a second season to span the events of the manga, and yes the second season has already been confirmed. So until the second season releases, I'll have to keep myself entertained with the wonders of the first season. And you know, I really don't have a problem with that.",1291939200,35,2768,4.68724279835391
