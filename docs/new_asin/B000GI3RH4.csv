2613381,5,B000GI3RH4,I think this was the neatest DVD yet for Eloise fan lovers and kids.  My grandchildren loved it and so did I.  We just love Eloise and all the antics she does.  Hope you can make more DVDs.  We'd be interested in purchasing them.,1168128000,,229,4.136363636363637
2613402,4,B000GI3RH4,"I can't say its my favorite show of his to watch, but I suppose its better than others. But he loves this show the best hands down. He can barely even talk, but he points at the tv and shouts ""ELOISE!!!"". Its so cute I had to buy it for him.",1389225600,,241,3.7450980392156863
2613403,5,B000GI3RH4,"Like the other Eloise movies, I bought this one when Netflix lost the streaming rights. It arrived quickly and was well packaged.",1356220800,,129,4.909090909090909
2613404,4,B000GI3RH4,MY 3 YEAR OLD LOVES THIS MOVIE AND IT HAS GIVEN HER HOURS OF ENTERTAINMENT.,1265328000,,75,4.066666666666666
2613405,5,B000GI3RH4,"My 4.5 year-old has only recently started enjoying the animated show centered on precocious 6-year-old Eloise. In this DVD ""Me, Eloise"", the self-assured little girl who resides at the Plaza Hotel is about to celebrate her sixth birthday but someone else steals the limelight - a little girl called Yuko, who is a talented violinist. Eloise is determined to get Yuko to attend her birthday tea party, but Yuko's strict manager refuses to let Yuko attend. However, Eloise eventually comes to the rescue in her own sassy way and has a wonderful birthday as well.

The Eloise stories are great fun for young girls, and my little girl has become a fan. Sometimes caution does need to be exercised when viewing this with younger children as Eloise's manner may come across as almost bratty, though she is mostly just verbally and emotionally advanced for her age and very expressive. On the whole, the DVDs are enjoyable and great fun!",1244678400,,930,4.849056603773585
2613406,5,B000GI3RH4,"Me, Eloise is just another in a long line of wonderful products featuring our favorite 6 year old.  She's funny and always into something - just like my own 6 year old.  Eloise is a refreshing character that always has an important life lesson, or two, in her adventures.  My girls and I sit and laugh, and laugh, and laugh over her crazy adventures.  This DVD is a must have in any Eloise collection.  OH, if you're ever in NYC, make sure to stop by The Plaza to check out the new Eloise shop that has just been finished.  Great adventure, for sure!",1243728000,,550,4.29126213592233
2613407,4,B000GI3RH4,"This is a cute movie for my 3 1/2 year old grandchildren. Opens the door for discussions on ""good"" and ""bad"" behavior. Eloise is a fun, lively child and they like to see what she will do next.",1233532800,,192,4.078947368421052
2613408,4,B000GI3RH4,"This video was adorable!  I remember Eloise from when I was a child, and I'm happy to be able to share the stories with my daughter.  This is a perfect little video for those long car rides, or waiting in the doctors office, or just cuddling in the coudh.  I just love Eloise, so this one was a big hit!",1217894400,2,303,4.016666666666667
2613409,4,B000GI3RH4,"I got this for my daughter when she was nearly 3 ... after she fell in love with the Christmas Eloise movie from this same cast & producer. She enjoys this--particularly watching how two children learn how to get to know each other. I like this production--love Tim Curry and Lynn Redgrave, and I think Mary Matilyn Mouser, who does Eloise's voice, does a great job.",1203638400,4,366,4.5606060606060606
2613410,5,B000GI3RH4,"I have purchased ""Eloise"" dvds from you before, and have always found then very good, as is this one. It arrived in a timely manor, and was well wrapped and labeled.

Thank You, E. Capiaux",1168473600,2,188,4.371428571428571

8132511,3,B000GI3RH4,"A friend introduced this to my daughter. And she loves it. I, however, don't care for Eloise's sassiness or the name calling. Just hoping my daughter doesn't begin to model her. This doesn't stop me from letting her watch it as it is very entertaining.",1468540800,,252,4.622222222222222

8132515,5,B000GI3RH4,"My 6 year old loves this animated movie.  9 year old loves it, too.  And it's a good story, so I enjoy it along with them.  Also try the non animated ""Eloise at the Plaza"" with Julie Andrews, which my daughter and I love.  Nothing beats the original Eloise book, but both of these videos do a good job of keeping in the spirit of the characters.",1415232000,,345,4.104477611940299
