8483416,5,B005QIOJ26,Any Howard Keel product is automatically great. This is no exception. He is in fine voice with a great selection. The shame is that it is only 37 minutes. There is at least 90 minutes of his performances on Bell Telephone Hour shows. How about a part 2 to complete the record for his many fans.  Bryan Baker,1323475200,5,307,4.293103448275862
