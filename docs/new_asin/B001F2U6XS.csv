3562293,5,B001F2U6XS,"This was such a good anime! The back story was so interesting and flowed well with the anime. I'm so glad they introduce it with each episode instead of having one full episode where everything is explained. The plot moves quickly but not too quickly that you can't keep up with who's who or what's actually going on.

The characters were colorful and non-stoic too! Jiro is a great mix of Alucard and D but I'm so glad that he isn't the stereotypical brooding type. Mimiko is so funny, strong, and independent yet sensitive and willing to see vampires as people as well. Kotaro is just adorable and grows up so much in just 12 episodes. The Lord Dragon was AWESOME and Cain's true form totally catches you by surprise!! I even liked how the bad guys weren't completely Hell-bent on evil as well!

This anime came from a set of light novels that I'm dying to read! If they're anything like the Vampire Hunter D light novels, they're also worth buying... if you can find them!

All in all, a fantastic show! Definitely going to buy this one!",1260748800,,1040,4.492063492063492
3562294,5,B001F2U6XS,This was a great anime saga. Too short thought!  It leaves you wanting more.......the continued saaga between the good and the BAD vampires!!!!! Yes!  Loved it!,1250208000,,160,5.115384615384615
3562295,5,B001F2U6XS,"BLACK BLOOD BROTHERS BOX SET was on sale at Amazon, so after reading the reviews and watching the clip I thought I'd give it a try.

The box set has three DVDs with 4 episodes on each DVD and is the complete BLACK BLOOD BROTHERS series.

The anime series is about a cool vampire named Jiro and his little brother Kotaro who make their way to a place called the ""Special Zone,"" where humans and vampires live together in peace. They meet up with a vampire and human negotiator named Mimiko, who's a human, and she helps them along the way. Anyway, there's a sect of vampires called the Kowloon (koo-lawn) Children who are rabid, evil vampires and they want to destroy the ""Special Zone"" by infecting everyone with their tainted blood. So Jiro has to join forces with the good vampires and the humans to help defeat the Kowloon Children.

I found the series really riveting with an interesting storyline, endearing characters, great action scenes, and the animation is well drawn. The English voice overs are really good too as each actor matches the character he/she is portraying, but there's an option to play the original Japanese language track with English sub-titles.

At first, I found the character of Kotaro a little annoying but he grew on me after a couple of episodes.

If you like anime and are looking for a complete series that's cool, has great action, and endearing characters, I would definitely recommend the BLACK BLOOD BROTHERS BOX SET. Hopefully, there will be another season/series that continues on with the storyline and we get more of Jiro, Kotaro and Mimiko.",1249257600,5,1584,4.766423357664234

I'm not sure why this anime has garnered such praise, but it is praise that is undeserved. Black Blood Brothers is a terrible show in every way.

3562402,5,B001F2U6XS,"I originally saw this series at a high school anime club in California and when I got a chance to buy it, jumped to do so.  It's an interesting take on vampires, dividing them into various castes. Though the flashbacks telling the story of how Jiro (aka Silver Blade) became a vampire is a little roughly injected, once one realizes those scenes are flashbacks, there's no problem.  The various vampire both good and bad are well characterized, though it may take a bit to decided who's actually good and who's not...expect for the slavering ones who rant and rave and attack everyone in sight...they're obvious.

Mimiko is an interesting character, as complex in her own way as Jiro, obviously falling in love with him while at the same time wary of anything vampire. Jiro's reaction ranges from obviously returning the emotion to a little heavy-handed teasing. When she offers to give him blood to strengthen him for an upcoming battle, and experiences an orgasmic surge as a result, his reaction is ""Mimiko...you're drooling. His gratitude for her being a virgin, because ""Virgin blood is a supreme delicacy for vampires,"" gets him knocked while he lays there and laughs at her embarrassment.

Little brother Kotaro is more than he seems, it's learned at the end, but for all intents and purposes, during most of the story he's simply a little boy following his big brother's lead while still aware of the dangers being a Black Blood brings.  IT's interesting Kotaro can go out in sunlight and eat food while JIro also appeared during the day though he always well-covered by hat, coat,and carried a paper parasol to protect him from the sun.

There is a fairly complex back-story so occasionally one has to listen closely, so no getting up and running to the fridge for a snack.

All in all, it's an enjoyable story and  while I wasn't entirely satisfied with the ending, if there'd been a sequel, I'd surely buy it, too.",1405641600,2,1925,4.77710843373494

The commentaries are the disks for each episode are great but are in Japanese only. If you prefer dubs, then sadly your out of luck with the special features. My advice, listen to both, it add a lot of depth to any series. The story line is good and unveils itself at a good pace, not leaving you wondering what's going on for ages like some anime can do. If you like anime and vampires I highly recommend Black Blood Brothers.",1386979200,,724,4.291970802919708

3562425,3,B001F2U6XS,"Standing next to the hordes of vampire anime out there, this one actually shines. It's lighter hearted, but still retains a more interesting storyline than plotless gore festivals like Hellsing and Trinity Blood. The animation leaves a bit to be desired, but it's clean. The action is done well. The comedy works (when the annoying character maxes out his whiny meter, he is physically beaten by the protagonist and all is well). Unlike most anime, the love interest doesn't seem forced. This just works. If the series had been allowed to expand past 12 episodes, it might be neck and neck with other lighthearted action shows like Bleach and Naruto.

The reason it didn't earn five stars is because it's not a groundbreaking piece of work. The reason it didn't get four stars is because it's a simple story and the animation isn't stellar. However, it's a simple story that works. Usually S.A.V.E. houses some pretty shameful animations in the way of quality, but not here. If you're low on cash and need a solid anime to entertain you through the week, this is it. Enjoy.

I'm an animator and writer, so I pour through stacks of anime seeking quality inspiration. If this review was helpful or our tastes seem to align, then check out my other reviews. I'll try to steer you straight.",1380153600,,1286,4.736607142857143
3562426,3,B001F2U6XS,"What we have on our hands here is a plot wrought with mystery and unique developments in the storyline, some predictable, but the best part is that it maintains fidelity to a semblance of originality.

The vampire lore has some new twists, which I found refreshing.  The story centers on brothers Jiro & Kotaro, who are known as ""black bloods""--a title bestowed by the coexisting humans on vampires, while the humans are ""red bloods"" in the story world.  Jiro is known also known as an Old Blood...which will be explained in the story.  And then there are Kowloons (pron. koo-lawn) which are basically vampires with a mutated bloodline that's parasitic (think of the vampires from Blade II).  The story transports us to like a segregated populace, a safe zone for the vampire breed, where there is like a mafia-style division of territory, controlled by ""affiliate houses"".  So there's rivalries there.

There are lots of major players on the stage in this drama, it's really good but the character of Kotaro--MAKES ME WANNA GIVE THIS A 3 for that annoying excuse for a character.  I don't know why English translation companies on the anime scene are so compelled to use female voice actors for the parts of male youth but it getting old.  Kotaro's annoyance factor is like that of Ed (Cowboy Bebop) and Merle (Escaflowne) combined!!!  There is a human guide, Sayuka who plays co-star to the brothers.  There are other Old Bloods and one like super old vampire known as Crimson Eyed Zelman who is treated with a reverential awe by foes and allies alike--kinda cool mystery about him.

The story starts with a flashback of a scene of Jiro just slayin' all kindsa Kowloon vampires 10 years before the main storyline...which flashes forward and the gaps and pieces between are filled in as the series develops.  Jiro has a mysterious past that they reveal piece-by-piece, usually at the beginning of an episode--this is interesting because it's pretty uniformly-done.  I enjoyed it.

Jiro is a really outstanding character in the anime world, with some serious potential...think Guts from Berserk, or Spike from Cowboy Bebop.  He has that kinda cool-guy allure but don't mess with him, 'cause he's super bad ass albeit not all-powerful.  Very maverick and cavalier type of dude who can wreck shop when he wants to and when he shows glimpses of his abilities--it's impressive.  If the series had gone for a full 24-26 episodes--I think we could've had a classic anime.

I really, really liked the story but Kotaro's voice actor really took a lot of enjoyment from me.  It seriously hurts the series.  But it's still overall good enough to own, especially for the price.  It's unique and well-drawn and the story develops pretty well, the main characters have interesting chemistry's on-screen, and the dynamics although predictable are the good cliches that draw you into the series.  This is a nice break from all the ninja or mecha anime I usually watch, since the only vampire anime I like is Vampire Hunter D (can't stand helsing).

Having just finished it--I think it's better to save your money.  I don't think it's justifiable to pay money for how they abruptly end the show.  It's not fair to take advantage of the culture and fans like that.  It has some valid traits and even some admirable displays of uniqueness but just falls tremendously short.  cue any analogy to wasted potential in history and this compares.

Just my two abe lincolns--enjoy!!!

Edit...this story does end rather abruptly, almost before they really even get to give the characters any meaningful depth.

It's like they were on the fringe of greatness with some really outstanding potential for some of these characters, but they ran out of funding or something 'cause saying they were rushed to conclude the story is an understatement.  It ends onna cliffhanger for sure...I hope they pick this project up and finish it to give its characters the depth they deserve and conclude the story properly.  This show has lots of potential, think of it like the first season of Berserk but only if Berserk ended at episode 12.  Kinda strange...",1379203200,,4117,4.884726224783861
3562427,5,B001F2U6XS,This is a great value for your money. A anime about a vampire and his brother are old bloods. Jiro if I remember correctly is waging a war on another vampire race. There's no sparkling here.,1377907200,,190,4.305555555555555

3562460,4,B001F2U6XS,"There's really not a lot of original, un-cliched vampire television and/or movies out there. Your best bet is anime.

One good example of this is ""Black Blood Brothers,"" an all-too-short anime that spins up several kinds of vampires -- good, bad, and creepy ones. Gorgeous art, a likable lead vampire, and a very unique mythology -- and while the first couple episodes are decent but not outstanding, the story starts to really bloom when the bad-guy vampires enter the scene. Too bad it ended WAY prematurely.

Two vampires -- powerful Jiro and his little brother Kotaro -- are stowing away on a Chinese ship on their way to Japan. Their destination: the Safe Zone, where vampires and humans are allowed to coexist. But then a firefight breaks out on board between some immigrant vampires and an anti-vampire military squad, and Jiro has no choice but to get involved.

Afterwards they are helped by a Company worker named Mimiko -- but things get nasty when the military shows up again. And then Jiro learns that his little brother and Mimiko are with the immigrant vampires -- and one of them is a Kowloon Child, the most lethal and contagious form of vampire. And it's headed for the Safe Zone.

Unfortunately this battle isn't the last one Jiro must face. More vampires are attacking them, and some old acquaintances of Jiro's are involved -- including the malignant Cassa, a former companion of his who betrayed him and his long-dead lover. As more Kowloon Children rise in the city, Mimiko starts doing research on something called the ""eleventh yard,"" which is somehow key to the future of the Kowloon Children (and in turn, to everybody else as well).

""Black Blood Brothers"" spends a minimum of time setting up its mythology -- you get to see what's going on through brief flashbacks and references to the past (Jiro's grief-filled battle with Cassa in the war). But it's an interesting one -- lots of different breeds of vampires, with different powers, weaknesses, and histories.

It's also a great blend of comedy, mild horror and bullet-dodging action. And in the second half of the series, the action and horror start amping up in a slow build to the climax. But it has some softer edges too -- there are flashbacks to Jiro's tender relationship to the dead Alice, as well as a cute budding relationship with Mimiko (including some rather erotic feeding scenes. The one problem: it feels like there was a second season planned (which was never made) so there are some plot threads hanging.

Jiro is a likable vampire protagonist -- despite being deadly and rather tragic at times, and occasionally whomping his brother on the head, he can also be funny, goofy or affectionate. Despite his tragic past, he doesn't go all emo on us, and he has outbursts of all-too-human emotion (""You're DEAD!"" he yells at an ally who messed up their travel plans) that make him very likable.

Kotaro isn't quite as endearing, primarily because he's a spunky little kid. It's almost impossible not to make them annoying, but he does have some endearing moments. And though she seems rather irritable at first, Mimiko makes an excellent potential love interest for Jiro. Cassa is deliciously nasty, and there's also the enigmatic child-king Sei, the delightfully sociopathic Clock, and the traumatized Kelly.

Despite its lack of a ""real"" ending, the ""Black Blood Brothers"" series is a solid anime series -- it has a delightful balance of blood, vampires, laughs and plenty of action. Definitely worth checking out.",1309219200,16,3511,4.887394957983194

3562464,4,B001F2U6XS,"From 2004-2006, author Kohei Azano and illustrator Yuuya Kusaka had worked on his light novel series ""Black Blood Brothers"" (a.k.a. BuBuBu) which was serialized in ""Monthly Dragon Magazine"" and ""Monthly Dragon Age"".  In 2006, Studio Live and Group TAC produced a 12-episode anime series which aired on Tokyo MX.

With the popularity of vampire-based series and storylines in America as of late, now is a perfect time for FUNimation to release the vampire-based anime series on Blu-ray.

The series is directed by Hiroaki Yoshikawa (who worked on ""Chaos;Head"", ""Grenadier"" and various ""Pokemon"" films), writer Yuu Sugitani (""Gin Rei"", ""World of Narue"") and features character designs by Toshiyuki Sugano (various ""Dragon Ball"" related series, ""Trigun"", ""Gungrave""), art backgrounds by Yoji Yoshikawa (""Grenadier"", ""EX-Driver"", ""Aria the Natural"") and mechanical design by Nishiki Itaoka (""Grenadier"", ""Alien Nine"").

VIDEO:

""Black Blood Brothers - The Complete Series"" is presented in 1080p HD 169. The series was released in 2006 and is an upscale, but picture quality-wise, it is a good upscale in which edge enhancement is limited and I did not see any combing or major compression artifacts.  Blacks are nice and deep and I've checked to see if there was  lot of haloing and I didn't see too much of it, but there are scenes where you do see it but by no means is it distracting at all.

At first, I had questioned the overall look of this vampire anime series.  I thought Jiro's red outfit was somewhat lame at first.  But actually, the costume kind of grown on me and if anything, I can possibly see how cosplayers would go crazy to dress like Jiro or the Dark covenant.  But character designer Toshiyuki Sugano (worked on key animation for ""Dragon Ball"" related series) did a good job with the overall character designs.  There is a bit of softness to the overall look and feel to the series.

As for art backgrounds, this is where things differ quite a bit.  At times, there are backgrounds that really look nice and some that look plain.  Usually, Yoji Yoshikawa is known for solid background art, from his work on ""Aria"", ""Grenadier"" and ""EX-Driver"" but according to the director in the final episode audio commentary, the production group were under the gun in trying to produce this anime series to the final seconds of it having it released and aired on Tokyo MX.

So, it does explain why the series does utilize mostly close up face shots and very little art backgrounds and there are some frames where the blue lines are seen instead of black.

Up-close animation was good and some of the fighting scenes were cool but it's a series that doesn't show fluid battle scenes, more like pieces of scenes of Jirou slashing a vampire rather than the actual frames of action of him doing it.  But I figured that since it is shown on Tokyo MX (and is the home for Tokyo Governor Ishihara, the Hanshin Tiers and F.C Tokyo) and is partially owned by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, you're not going to see major violence.  There is a small amount of blood but nothing to be scared of.

If anything, the more mature themes, comes from the English dub dialogue (which uses profanity) but other than that, the series is not scary at all.

Overall, animation is fine, while the final episode was especially well-done.

AUDIO:

""Black Blood Brothers - The Complete Series"" is presented in English Dolby TrueHD 2.0 and in Japanese Dolby TrueHD 2.0.  I have to admit that I was surprised to find out that this action-driven anime series was presented in English Dolby TrueHD 2.0 since most of the anime releases have received a 5.1 lossless soundtrack.

So, for the most part, both lossless soundtracks are front channel driven.  Those with a modern receiver can receive a more immersive soundtrack by having their receiver set on stereo on all channels but for the most part, both lossless soundtracks are front channel-driven.

I watched the series both in Japanese and English and both are well-done.  I actually enjoyed the English dubbed soundtrack a lot and did test this disc on a few systems and screens. Audio is crisp and clear and its important to note that the English version does give it a more mature feeling because of the profanity that is used.  Much different dialogue than its Japanese counterpart.

I will say that the subtitling may be hard to read for those with smaller screens, especially since it utilizes a smaller white font.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have to admit that with the vampire craze still in full-effect in the US, it's perfect timing for FUNimation Entertainment to take advantage of the craze by releasing the anime series ""Black Blood Brothers"".

As mentioned earlier, I was taken back by the red outfit of the main protagonist, Jiro.  I was not feeling any love for this vampire in a red campy outfit but it somehow grew on me and I figured that the Victorian look for some of these vampires will surely attract the cosplayers out there.

But I found the storyline to be quite interesting.  In a ""Angel"" (for the ""Buffy the Vampire"" series fans) type of way, having this vampire take on other vampires is pretty cool.  Granted, you're not going to find any major love between the characters of Jiro and the human Mimiko but their friendship and their adventures through the Special Zone was quite interesting to watch.

The characters, primarily with the three main characters, Jiro, Kotaro and Mimiko were fun to watch, as the humorous banter between the three characters is quite fun to watch at times.  Especially to see Jiro teasing Mimiko and to see her get very violent when she feels she is being teased.  And as for Kotaro, it's interesting to see Jiro punish his young brother by slamming his head into the wall (yes, Kotaro is a young boy but he is immune to having his face bashed to a wall or being thrown around).

I'm not too familiar with the light novel series from Kouhei Azano, so I'm not too sure of how much of the actual storyline was not featured on the anime series but judging from this series alone, viewers should be content that you do receive some closure with this series and it helps to know that this is a short anime series at 12-episodes long.  Also, Azano does play a major role in the audio commentary included in this Blu-ray release.

""Black Blood Brothers"" may not be a blood-fes nor a dark, violent anime series but it is a fun and enjoyable series and for the most part, an easily accessible short anime series from FUNimation Entertainment on Blu-ray.  I know that there are people who will balk at the decision to not have a lossless 5.1 soundtrack but I'm not going to complain for a series that was released in 2006.

But PQ for an upscale and the inclusion of the Japanese lossless 2.0 soundtrack should make some fans happy.  Also, this release also has a lot of audio commentary (one for each episode) by the original Japanese voice talent and a few with the original creator Kouhei Azano plus a good amount of extra special features included as well.  This may be the first anime series on Blu-ray in the US to have a commentary track for each episode which is fantastic!

It's important to note that the series is not for younger audiences.  For the most part, it's a safe, accessible anime series that doesn't show too much blood but it does have its darker moments and the anime series English soundtrack does have its fair share of profanity.

Overall, ""Black Blood Brothers"" is a fun, vampire anime series with a good amount of humor, drama and action.  It's not the best anime TV series on Blu-ray in the US but it's easy to get into and it is quite fun and very enjoyable and despite being only 12 episodes long, the series makes up for it with the Japanese audio commentary for each episode, which is rarity for any anime Blu-ray or DVD release, especially to have the original creator involved.  That is very rare.

So, I really enjoyed this release and the ""Black Blood Brothers - The Complete Series"" is definitely worth checking out!",1283731200,3,10468,4.921232876712328
