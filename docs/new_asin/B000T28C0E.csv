8207163,3,B000T28C0E,"Because Blacks were segregated in many places in the U.S., an industry grew up of  films with black actors played to black audiences. The first film was made in 1912 (The Railroad Porter) by Oscar Micheaux, a Chicago sports writer. More black films appeared in the wake of the racist stereotypes from Birth of a Nation (1915) including the Birth of a Race (1918).

Films about blacks and featuring blacks were commonplace (Uncle Toms Cabin, Sambo) but what distinguished the all black films was that the entire production was black.

By the time this film was made (1939) blacks were fairly well integrated into the mainstream cinema (e.g., Hattie McDaniel won the Oscar for Gone with the Wind), but because of segregation there was a need for films that appealed to blacks. The Bronze Buckaroo follows Harlem on the Prairie (1937) and Two Gun Man from Harlem (1938), both of them directed by Richard Kahn and both starring Herb Jeffries (1913-2014), Hollywoods first singing cowboy. In fact Jeffries was such a good singer he left the big screen and went to work for Duke Ellington, but before switching careers, he produced and starred in several of these films, earning himself the nickname of The Bronze Buckaroo.

The film itself has some funny moments, but its hardly worth viewing apart from the historical significance. You might recognize big Spencer Williams (1893-1969), the  Andy from the classic Amos n Andy TV series from 1951 to 1953. Williams appeared in all 3 of the Bronze Buckaroo films.",1468540800,,1506,4.913385826771654

8207166,5,B000T28C0E,Very enjoyable vintage Western with an African-American cast. Herb Jeffries makes a superb hero. He can really sing too!,1115942400,3,120,5.368421052631579
8207167,2,B000T28C0E,"Crooner Herb Jeffries made it a first in a trio of ""B"" Westerns in the late 30's that featured an all-black cast. All in all, the films came across very well, with good direction and action and are worth viewing  today. The other two titles are ""Harlem Rides the Range"" and  ""Harlem on the Prairie.""",964224000,4,299,4.418181818181818
