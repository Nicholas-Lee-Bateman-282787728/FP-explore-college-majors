8538705,5,B009AVC9K4,Seriously one of the best series ever!! The subtitles where well done and easy to read. I love that it is the original Japanese (characters sound much better). Packaging is good but they are all stacked on top of each other but  that's not a reason not to buy. If you love series like special A and maid-sama then you will love this series!!,1371340800,,341,4.328125

8538707,5,B009AVC9K4,"I absolutely love this anime and was so happy to see a complete box set for sale on Amazon.  The quality is great, although the DVDs can be somewhat difficult to remove from the case since they are all stacked on top of each other on one spindle.  Overall, this set is a must have for any Kobato fans or anime fans in general!",1366502400,,326,4.078125
