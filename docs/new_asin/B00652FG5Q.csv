Ricardo Montalban portrayed a side of his acting ability I had never seen.  Previously, I only knew of him in in television roles.  Wendell Corey and Claire Trevor give a good performance.  You can feel each actor's role- Montalban uplifting, Corey racism, Trevor beat down and angry, and Winters beaten by life, but heroic.",1472342400,,477,4.686746987951807
