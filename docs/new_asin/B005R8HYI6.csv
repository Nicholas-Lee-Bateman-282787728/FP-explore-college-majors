8484183,4,B005R8HYI6,"This goes only to the movie itself, not the quality of any copies, dvds, etc. I'd always wanted to see this because it is an adaptation of Faulkner's Sanctuary, though quite a loose one.  Also it was roundly condemned as immoral by the Catholic Legion for Decency and one of the movies that precipitated the Hays Code, that typically American attempt to protect the ""innocent"" (Oh! Think of the children!), stifle creativity and mature discussion, and legislate morality.  For those reasons, the movie is interesting.  There is the garish plot (SPOILER) whereby party girl/tease Temple joyrides with ne'er-do-well beau, becomes stranded at bootleggers' hideout, is presumably raped off-screen (though not with Faulknerian flourish), becomes bootlegger's moll and possible hooker, witnesses and commits murder, and, unlike the book, emerges a heroine of sorts.  The film does include all of these less than genteel happenings, though all occur off screen, except for the violence (how typically American).  Though it is pre-Hays Code, it is amazing how much unpleasantness is expressed.  Apart from the provocative story, the acting is quite good, highlighted by the two women in the story played by Miriam Hopkins and Florence Eldridge.  The heavy. played by Jack LaRue, is another matter. LaRue made an impression of heavy menace and seemed to have perfected the art of playing every scene with a cigarette screwed into his mouth.  As an actor, however, he didn't do much, and the director was pleased to climax his most threatening appearances with LaRue's slow, ominous approach to the camera, rather like Dracula approaching a snack.  The rest of the cast is pretty forgettable.  As to the movie scenes, there is a decent attempt to create the sense of uncertainty, menace and inevitable disaster at the bootleggers' that is such a part of the novel  As to the trial, the part of the lawyer Benbow. the social bickering among Benbow's family, the fate of the accused, Temple's fate, and Faulkner's sense of social impotence, hopelessness, and the  inevitability of tragedy, all these are pretty well botched, altered or ignored by the movie.  In other words, if you are expecting a thoughtful interpretation of Sanctuary, you will be disappointed.  On the other hand, the movie isn't bad on its own terms and it does show just about how far a pre-Code movie could go.",1457395200,3,2371,5.093023255813954
8484184,5,B005R8HYI6,This movie convinces me beyond any other piece of evidence that the Hays Code for movies was the most stupid of all politically motivated attempts at censorship in the history of the world.  This stupid code essentially shattered the ability of all American film directors from making realistic adult films for the 'non-brainwashed' members of the movie-going public for the following 30 some years.,1419033600,2,399,5.234375
8484185,5,B005R8HYI6,"I caught this as ""The Story of Temple Drake"" on TCM last night in a good print. Miriam Hopkins was luminous as Temple,  the daughter of a Southern judge in a small town. She's spoiled, loose and can't settle down because there's ""something"" inside her.  On a drunken joyride with one of her boyfriends, they have a wreck in a bad storm on a desolate backroad and end up at an  old broken down farm with a family of  ignorant criminal country folk with a psychotic gangster named ""Trigger"" also in residence.  After being forced to sleep in the barn overnight, Temple is raped by Trigger and witnesses him kill the youngest member who was supposed to be guarding her. In a state of shock, she is then taken by Trigger to a seedy ""boarding house""  as his mistress. But things are far from over yet....I found this film, based on William Faulkner's notorious ""Sanctuary"", to be fascinating. It shows it's age but what does hold up is Hopkin's performance. She's excellent and she carries the film surrounded by lesser known actors.  It's a definite Pre-code film;, the story is very adult and the implications are sordid and revolting. If it was given a proper, restored DVD release I would buy it. To me, this is a rare Pre-code that should be available to all Pre-code lovers out there. Plus it features that wonderful performance by one of the 30's most dynamic actresses, Miriam Hopkins. This is a must see.",1410566400,11,1408,4.608

Well buyer  beware -- it is a cheap rip from some secondary source. While I am happy to finally have had a chance to see the film - I am disappointed by the false claims and poor reproduction.",1391558400,14,350,4.072463768115942
