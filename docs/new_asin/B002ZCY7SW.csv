4014772,4,B002ZCY7SW,"By Jan on 12/08/17:  I binge watched 24 while recovering from surgery. I gave it just 4 stars because I had to hit Mute whenever the excessive gunfire erupted.  I find many series' that go on for years tend to employ gratuitous violence and forget to develop characters.  That said I do admit to getting hooked and sitting on the edge of my chair ... as much as my stitches would allow LOL.  It was hard to get my head wrapped around the fact that each season took place over one single day.  The series went through 4 presidencies (I think), each showing the frailties of their humanity.  Like him or not, the only character that stayed true to form was Jack.  I had to get past his head bobbing and slow blinking, plus his violent tendencies, to appreciate his inner sense of decency.  24 doesn't let a character's likeability keep them on board; many end up dead.  But Chloe's character evolved nicely and she endures to the bitter end.",1512691200,2,939,4.476470588235294

4014788,5,B002ZCY7SW,"[This is not the last season but if you are a n00b you will not know it based on the dropdown box. ""24: Live Another Day is the last"".] Season 8 shockingly has the best, easy-to-understand plot. Jack is featured and President Taylor is thankfully downgraded. Chloe is fantastic. President Hassan is great. Ex-President Logan stole the show AGAIN.

This feels like The End. Arguable the best episode in 24's history occurs when Jack goes on a suicide run and puts on the black bodysuit and mask and takes everyone out in NYC.

The political intrigue is outstanding. Nothing was too far fetched this time and the romance was kept to a minimum.",1505520000,,641,4.663716814159292
4014789,4,B002ZCY7SW,"This last season was pretty good, lots of twists and turns and unexpected last scenes.

This is a series that will be missed, a real edge of seat thriller with a huge BUT...Far too much LOUD (what they call) music, repetitive lines, dark  rooms using 5 watt bulbs throughout so all you see is partial faces of men and all the cleavage of women in the worst, most frumpy clothing collection ever.chosen.

4014791,5,B002ZCY7SW,"Note: This review will briefly encompass the final four seasons (albeit the final one was a limited event series comprised of half the number of episodes in the latter eight seasons), so as not to give too much away.

After the shocking events of season five, a short prequel on the bonus disc of said season cleverly sets up the next season, and it is a shocker. The stakes are higher than ever for Jack Bauer, and it only gets more personal as Jack is forced to deal with rogue agents and a searing betrayal; in addition, foreign governments as well as his own are on his trail; but Jack always finds his way back to do what is right. Season six only ratchets up the intensity, and the show's writing is as strong as ever, with a few unexpected surprises. Then, there is a special two hour movie: 24: Redemption in two versions (the broadcast television version and the Extended Version which features approximately twelve additional minutes not seen on television, the latter of which cleverly sets up season seven in a small but crucial way). Season Seven is the most intense season yet, and features a new setting: the heart of government. With unexpected betrayals and shocking twists and old enemies lurking in the shadows, season seven proves to be one of the best seasons ever. Then, season eight takes us in an as-yet-hitherto unexplored direction with a black chief and a young actor only known for stupid comedies who really proves that he can act. Betrayals, patriotism, and treason abound much more this season than in the previous seven, and the final four episodes are best seen one right after the other. 24 returns as a limited event series in 24: Live Another Day and the writers do NOT disappoint. The final episode parallels some of the previous seasons in many perfect ways.

The only minor disappointment is in the special features for seasons seven, eight, and nine. In the commentary for one of the deleted scenes in the final episode of season seven, mention was made of twenty minutes worth of deleted scenes for that episode been shot but only a few minutes worth of that material is on the DVD. Very disappointing. Season eight has barely a handful of deleted scenes sans commentary and hardly any behind-the-scenes material (save for some all too brief SceneMakers-detailed looks at how certain scenes were filmed). And 24: Live Another Day had even fewer deleted scenes sans commentary with next to no interviews with the cast and crew as the first six seasons did. Again, major let-down. But the inclusion of a storyline extension was a nice touch in more ways than one.

EDIT: 09/27/2017

I just saw all the Extended Episodes from season eight, which consist mainly of one scene that is not on the broadcast versions. The extra scenes don't add much, as they are only three to five minutes longer than the rehular episodes, but they provide some more context into the motivations of the characters. With the exception of the first episode on the penultimate disc, the Extended Episodes are better than the broadcast versions. Obviously, I will not say why, as to avoid giving anything away. Just trust me on this.

One more minor note: I hate it when beautiful women are arrested and they struggle or protest as they are led away.

So, it is with the greatest reluctance that we bid adieu to Jack Bauer. For eight-and-a-half seasons and a movie in between seasons six and seven, we have followed you at the Counter Terrorism Unit with great pleasure as you took down the enemies of this country, both foreign and domestic, and dealt with unimaginable betrayals and incredible losses, upholding the Constitution to the best of your ability, so help you God. But through it all, you did what was right. And if you are alive out there somewhere, we will be waiting for you.",1503273600,4,3803,4.719879518072289

4014793,4,B002ZCY7SW,"WARNING: SPOILERS! There have been many reviews on this season of '24' so something new should be said.  Some of the reviewers here don't completely understand that '24' is partially a cartoon, a comic book serial. This explains Jack's amazing healing powers, invincibility, etc. Some reviewers have complained about characters doing stupid things or things contrary to their personalities. These things are needed to keep the story moving, because with '24' the action is the key. It also explains President Omar Hassan's hair, a true helmet that only starts to look natural once he is pursued by Special Operatives. In comic books, often hair and other characteristics of characters are exaggerated, but in the case of Hassan's incredible hair, it may have just been a mistake. We had a hard time taking the character seriously sometimes, since the hair was so over the top. Also over the top was President Logan, fantastically portrayed in all of his Nixonian glory by Gregory Itzen. Logan is a man of complexity. He hatches outrageously elaborate and risky schemes to vindicate himself for past misdeeds, and often shows strength and bravery. Yet, in the face of Jack Bauer's body-armored rage, he becomes a sniveling coward. His schemes seem so carefully contrived, but anyone who can think on that level should know that his often hare-brained schemes will inevitable go wrong. He is my favorite '24' villain of all time, from his sheer boldness to his utter venality. Not only is he evil, he is a corrupter, able to twist and turn others skillfully into his webs of deceit. President Taylor, who just in Season 7 was a prim, overly scrupulous person, becomes a treacherous betrayer under Logan's skillful malice. All villains are evil, but not all can corrupt, and Logan is called ""poison' by Taylor herself. Granted, by Season 8 the formula for '24' has worn thin: the moles, the bad guys who have terrible aim, the insane rescues of and by Jack, and even the tough though sweet guy musings of Jack, as he goes from death wish to death wish, all the while surviving. Season 8 was very good, but if was time to put the series to bed. Jack's destiny at the end of the day really was moving though, all the way to the last tick of the clock. For whom does the clock tick, Jack? It ticks for thee.",1498867200,3,2301,4.7525

4014852,4,B002ZCY7SW,"Standard ""24"" fare - high intensity, nail biting, twisting storyline.  This season's violence and intensity seem more dark and intense.  Betrayal and abuse play a large part of the storyline, and anyone having a sensitivity to that may not enjoy this season as much.

4014893,5,B002ZCY7SW,"The Fox Network series entitled ""24"" is a post-9/11 counter-terrorism television program, which premiered in November, 2001, just two months after the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. This eighth and final season examines another 24-hour time period in the hectic life of Federal Agent Jack Bauer, originally from the Los Angeles branch of the Counter-Terrorism Unit, known as the CTU, as he battles frantically to thwart yet another diabolical conspiracy. The novel structure of this groundbreaking television series involves each episode representing a single hour in this very action-packed and challenging day. The character of Agent Jack Bauer is portrayed perfectly by actor Kiefer Sutherland, who plays an old-fashioned tough guy, who utilizes any means necessary to vanquish the forces of evil. Of course, the rather aggressive and sometimes brutal methods of Agent Bauer often blur the distinction between good and evil. This eighth season of ""24"" continues to be decidedly intelligent, fast-paced, and suspenseful, and it is a superb combination of the political thriller and action/adventure genres. Its use of real-time plot development, and the innovative split-screen technique, are absolutely brilliant. The riveting intrigue and captivating plot twists keep the viewer totally enthralled, because one never really knows who can be trusted. This outstanding Counter-Terrorism series ""24"" is truly my all-time favorite television program, and I enthusiastically, but sadly, give its eighth and final season a five-star rating, along with my very highest recommendation!",1486252800,4,1605,5.7478991596638656

4015021,3,B002ZCY7SW,"I watched 24 when it originally ran and couldn't wait for each week's episode. I just finished binge watching the whole series and have a slightly lower view of it. Discounting the fact that we have to suspend our connection to reality while watching, there is some really bad dialogue. I lost count of the number of times that Jack said ""I give you my word"" to someone who gets killed a few minutes later or ""you're just going to have to trust me"". The whole 24 hour thing really hurt the show. I wish I could go 24 straight hours without eating, going to the bathroom, loosening my tie or nodding off in a meeting. Also, do you think CTU could do a better job of vetting job candidates? Every season had a mole of some sort.

Season 8 takes place in New York. Having lived and worked in NYC my entire life, it's obvious that it was recorded elsewhere (Vancouver I guess like many other shows). That said, would it have really been difficult for the writers to get addresses and street names correct? The address of Jack's apartment would be about half way across the Hudson River to New Jersey. There are way too many other examples to list here.",1485129600,,1148,4.389671361502347

4015023,5,B002ZCY7SW,"I'm not generally a TV watcher, to say nothing of an entire season of episodes.

24 is, in my opinion, the best series ever. I have watched each and every episode from season 1, and never found anything that didn't cause me to wait anxiously for the next episode. I loved all of the characters (especially Rene Walker) and the extended plots.

My sole regret is that after season 8, it was gone. Bummer.",1485129600,,403,4.4324324324324325

Frankly I, as well as, I'm sure, many viewers are tired of the same old ""there's a mole"" plotline that appears in most seasons of the show.  Well the one this season was completely asenine and uncalled for.  That actor deserved better.  In any case, the season really picks up toward the final episodes and has you on the edge of your seat.

4015792,2,B002ZCY7SW,"Geez...what a TERRIBLE and disappointing season! I love 24, but what in the heck happened here? This season is nothing more than a re-hashing of previous plots and ideas. And JACK BAUER? He has turned into a barbaric psychopathic murderer. Where did his ""white hat"" (that is a little dirty and tattered) go? Why is a character that has been held up as an ideal of patriotism and valor in previous seasons been allowed to degenerate in this way? That was the magic of Jack Bauer's character in previous seasons...his methods were extreme and often dramatically unpleasant, but there was always a higher ideal at stake. Jack was always incredibly self-sacrificing and used his considerable personal pain to fuel his actions in a mostly positive way. I can see having a storyline in season 8 where Jack Bauer is tired of the sacrifice and snaps when he loses yet another woman he loves, but why did the creators of the show let it go so far? NOTHING justifies his behavior and I just didn't care about watching any more episodes of ""24"" after that... WHAT A LETDOWN",1481932800,,1062,4.684491978609626

4015871,4,B002ZCY7SW,"The last episode in the series was a very good one.  The ones leading up to it were less so.  ""Copy that."" was the most-used expression in the series.  The eight days portrayed in the series (albeit over a number of years), produced three traitors within C.T.U. who were all stopped within a few hours of beginning their nefarious activities.  At least two nuclear threats against the U.S.A. were successfully dealt with by Jack Bauer and company, although one exploded relatively harmlessly in the desert.  Two seasons - including the last one - ended with Jack having to leave C.T.U. as a fugitive.  There were also many surprising twists to the storylines, which added to the watchability of the series.",1481846400,,706,4.841666666666667

Jack Bauer is judge, jury and executioner as needs be.

4016380,3,B002ZCY7SW,"I have little to say about this series. The plot remains exactly the same as every other season, with Jack Bauer aka Kiefer Sutherland outside the CTU organization, but still, predictably, in the middle of it. Nobody in this organization trusts him except the chosen few who remain loyal. And of course, he is the ONLY one who has any notion of what's going on in the real world of counterterrorism and espionage. Jack seems to be the perennial underdog who just can't seem to catch a break with the powers that be...and yet, predictably, he is proven right in the end, only to get demoted and ostracized even further. Sure, the threats change, the bad guys change, but poor old Jack Bauer remains exactly the same. I'd really like to see this guy fail miserably, proving once and for all that the CTU hierarchy was correct all along about him. He's nearly an antihero, except he's not the one bungling every operation, CTU and the politicians are always the bunglers, except, of course, the president who is always duped by his or her trusted confederates. I really hope there will be no ninth season, unless Jack is reinstated as the proven head of CTU, and the plot changes completely. I have a friend who watches this series when we get together for coffee, otherwise I would not watch it at all. Anything and everything that could possibly go wrong always does, predictably putting Jack Bauer in dire straits...again, and again, and again.",1478390400,,1444,4.711462450592886

At times you tend to roll your eyes at the speed and ease of CTU in downloading all the information they may need on a particular building and its interior layout,and forwarding it to Jack Bauer for escape routes, etc. but it all adds to the mystique of Jack and the CTU. I have never found an episode boring to watch. Jack Bauer is relentless, brutal, and caring, all rolled into one unstoppable killing machine. And let us not forget that even Superman wears Jack Bauer shorts !",1476230400,,636,4.398305084745763

This season has several subplots which are not believable and poorly written. Of course Jack is back but he seems very tired and try to keep the show alive. I think the network should stop the show rather than continue with twists and turns and try to create few cliff hanger here and there but not flow smoothly as previous seasons.

Jack gets beaten to a pulp (tortured) but only because he's tied down but he escapes and kills each of the bad guys, What would the world do without him?  And plot  (and danger ) constantly changes as Jack knocks off one super villain guy after another.  And it is amazing that as they travel from hot-spot to hot-spot they do it all in about 20 minutes or less. Guess that's the nature of a show that takes place in 24 hours - each episode ends in a crises and in the next episode that crises get resolved only to end with another crisis. And how ironic that Jack Bauer is portrayed by Keiffer Sutherland! Talk about opposites!",1474243200,,748,4.359712230215828

8384581,5,B002ZCY7SW,"Finally, after 8 seasons, the people with the juice (President Taylor and CTU Director Hastings) get it through their thick skulls:  Just Do What Jack Bauer says.  In every season, we see annoying CYA suckups and pinhead buttsuckers from 'Division' getting in Jack's way while he chases down the horrifying terrorists and despicable traitors.  Honestly, the suckups are worse than the terrorists!  They show up in the middle of the night from 'Division' or 'the AG's office' to slow Jack down while he is deactivating the biological weapon with thirty seconds on the clock.  Some of 24's sweetest moments are when Jack Bauer socks an annoying suckup in the face or threatens them with life imprisonment if they don't get out of his way.  24/8's Director Hastings starts out as a pinhead but quickly catches on that Jack and Chloe are probably right since they've already saved America from a dozen WMD attacks.  He's a big improvement over Pinhead Deluxe Ryan Chappelle, Frodo from Lord of the Rings, and FBI Pinhead Larry Moss.  In the very moving finale of '24', President Taylor heeds Jack's moral compass just in time before crossing the line into Stalinism.  Though you'd think that by Season 8, the President would know better than to gamble her entire Administration on outsmarting Jack Bauer:  ""Any update on the search for Bauer?  Sorry, but Jack just took out the Russian Ambassador's entire security staff.""

It's too bad the writers of 24 had to kill off Lady Jack Bauer (FBI agent Renee Walker).  More than poor Teri or Audrey Raines, Agent Walker really was the perfect match for Jack -- stabbing rapists in the eyeballs and beating traitors half-to-death with her bare hands.  But Agent Walker's murder sets off Jack's final rampage of vengeance!

'24' boasts the most treacherous villains in TV history:  the horrifying Nina Meyers (so twisted and soulless that we never find out who she really worked for), Starbuck from Battlestar Galactica (a murdering liar to her last dying breath, only slightly less psychotic and twisted than Nina Meyers), and the worst of them all - President Charles Logan, a poisonous worm slithering around the Oval Office and up and down the global corridors of ultimate power.  The amazing actor Gregory Itzin portrays President Logan as Satan himself, poisoning President Taylor's mind with his perverted logic of presidential power.

As for Jack Bauer, what can you say?  ""Son, get out of my way or you're gonna get hurt.""  He's Ultimate Ultra.",1522368000,,2492,4.959036144578313

8384585,5,B002ZCY7SW,"The most epic show ever written. There is no other television series that can come close to the character development you see here. Over the 8 real seasons, you see Jack constantly doing the right thing. Sometimes the right thing has bad consequences but Jack's morals don't let him see it any other way. You get to watch the slow process of darkness envelop Jack as he tries to do what's honorable until it seemingly is too much for him. The story is not only about him, but also about friendship. Some are true while others are fake and filled with deceit. Can you really trust others to put their life down for you? Is there any integrity left in this political world? 24 shows the best in people and gives you one heck of a crazy ride at the same time.",1518998400,,756,4.330985915492958
