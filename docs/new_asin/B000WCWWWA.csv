8222765,3,B000WCWWWA,"Short, with a few good tips.  Overall, would have been better off to just google ideas.  Very overpriced for what you get.",1365120000,,122,4.5
8222766,4,B000WCWWWA,"A useful video for driving during winter conditions- would have liked to have seen more details on driving techniques- recovering from skids, but would still recommend its purchase.",1359849600,,181,5.5
8222767,5,B000WCWWWA,"While there are many videos on Youtube that attempt to show how to drive in slippery conditions, and even more that document what not to do, this professionally made DVD uses a combination of video of a car with a diagrammatic overlay showing weight transfer and tire position to clarify the concepts of acceleration, understeer, oversteer, and braking much better. It's also a good advertisement for the well run Bridestone Winter Driving School in Colorado - although they kept the self promotion to a minimum. Every driver should see and practice the techniques shown that will someday keep them out of trouble on a slick (doesn't have to be icy) road.",1262304000,,655,4.90990990990991
