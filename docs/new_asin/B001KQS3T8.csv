3668831,5,B001KQS3T8,"Legends of Air Combat presents an in-depth look at the most important military aircraft ever produced. Designed in 1952 and going into deployment in 1955, the B-52 Stratofortress is the longest-running production bomber ever produced. It is predicted the Air Force intends to keep the B-52 in service until 2045 - more than 90 years after the first B-52 entered service... an unprecedented length of service for any military aircraft! As someone who owns just about every recording related to Vietnam, I ordered this DVD not knowing what to expect. I'm happy to say I was pleasantly surprised by the caliber of this DVD. The interviews all look very clean and current, and the older video has a good, clean look (nothing like the poor, grainy video you see on some products).

The DVD is divided into 4 parts:
1) ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT
2) B-52 AND THE STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND
3) B-52 GOES TO WAR
4) LEGACY OF THE B-52

Featuring rare archival footage, dramatic combat sequences and interviews with the men who flew these legendary planes they affectionately nicknamed the BUFF (Big Ugly Fat F_ _ _ _ _) this episode explores the B-52s' development, operational deployment, combat characteristics and the strategic role it has played in the history of the United States. During the Cold War the B-52 was the backbone of America's Strategic Air Command, which was established in 1946 to provide 24-hour, around-the-clock protection with a fleet of B-52s in flight over North America. In the event of nuclear attack, a retaliatory strike could be ordered for the purposes of immediate reprisal. It was felt the benefit of a bomber was that it could always be called back, whereas once a missal is fired it's on its way. With the advent of intercontinental missals being carried by nuclear submarines that could launch from anywhere in the world at a moments notice, Strategic Air Command was deactivated in 1992. Then, with the escalating situation in Southeast Asia, it wasn't long before the BUFF would be back in service. With its ability to fly with in-flight refueling for extended periods of time, its superior performance and low operating costs, the Stratofortress has proven itself to be a valuable asset to the U.S. Air Force in various conflicts for more than half a century. From the Cold War and Vietnam, to the Gulf War and the War on Terror in Afghanistan, the B-52 remains a legendary bomber with a sterling performance record that has many more years of service remaining.",1323734400,17,2484,4.897862232779097
3668832,5,B001KQS3T8,"Excellent DVD esp. the part with the takeoff check list of the B-52D
over Vietnam. What a remembrance being at U-Tapao, 84, 82,000 lb bomb racks
(the big belly), 24 rack mounts of 750lb (18,000). What a load. But again
sorry.",1319328000,9,225,4.512195121951219
8315960,5,B001KQS3T8,Great Historical Video of a great work horse. As a Nuclear Weapon Specialist for 14 years on the BUFF it brought back a lot of memories.,1482883200,,136,4.269230769230769

8315962,4,B001KQS3T8,"Of the (4) ""Legends of Air Combat"" I have purchased, this is my favorite and was a pleasant surprise.  There is a lot of up close and personal footage about the B-52.  While I have reviewed other ""Legends of Air Combat"" videos less favorably, I think this one is worth the price for aviation geeks.",1423958400,2,298,4.4
8315963,5,B001KQS3T8,"Terrific photography, even if obviously a commercial for the Air Force and SAC.  We never knew what we owed to these aircrews and their fantastic planes during the cold war, but this is a chance to get the drift, and belatedly thank those who watched over this country while the rest of us slept, literally and figuratively.  Too short a film, but chocked full of information for those who are interested in the military and our nation's history.",1417392000,5,446,4.705128205128205

8315965,5,B001KQS3T8,"This portrayal of the B-52 is well done and has lots of footage and interviews. It was a satisfying video to watch. I may have to get more of this series. It was bought new at a discounted price. If you're a military buff, this is perfect. But, then again, I am an Air Force brat. I grew up with the roar of J57 engines.",1390435200,2,320,3.9384615384615387
8315966,5,B001KQS3T8,"There is no aircraft like it, and none that has stayed in service for so long. A great history that would be appreciated by any aircraft enthusiasts.",1384473600,,149,4.555555555555555
8315967,5,B001KQS3T8,"While it is kind of a basic documentary about the venerable B-52 bomber, it still has some eye opening tidbits that make this a must-watch for all B-52 fans. The narrator sounds like a robot at times, but it is negligible. Great picture and audio quality too.",1380240000,6,259,4.531914893617022
8315968,1,B001KQS3T8,"One of the worst documentaries I have seen in a long time.  B52 is a legend in military aircraft history. But, significant length of the documentary is filled with home produced quality materials and video collections.",1370390400,3,218,5.055555555555555
8315969,4,B001KQS3T8,"A documentary with a familiar format.  Covers the subject very well but could use more detail.  At least one ""fact"" cited is in error:  the number of MiG's shot down in Vietnam.",1364688000,5,177,4.46875
