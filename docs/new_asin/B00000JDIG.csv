7911932,4,B00000JDIG,"I just saw 2 of these episodes today. Tey were awesome. I started watching DBZ at the end of the Ginyu saga, so I never saw this saga before. If you see this DVD, watch Volumes 7 and 8 before this and thats all. you'll get every thing, so heres a short summary.
episode 26- Vegeta ( the bad guy) gets crushed by Gohan turnes into a giant ape. Vegeta manages to escape in his space pod and go to namek.
episode 27- Bulma and mr popo go try to find away to get to namek. mr popo shows bulma a namekian spacecraft. they get into space
episode 28 - the namekian ship is attacked by aliens.
thats as far as I know",1080777600,,608,3.951219512195122
7911933,2,B00000JDIG,If you really like american DBZ you can buy it if you want.  I would wait for the subtitles.  This DVD has three eppisodes.  If you are new to dbz this eppisode tells everyone their names... for example I am Vegeta supreim  ruler of the universe and you can't defeat the great Yajerobi.  The  eppisodes are after they defeat Vegeta and again it's good if you love  american DBZ but I don't.,961632000,,390,4.333333333333333
