938645,5,6304846126,"OMG! Finally, a movie that portrays the many roles of black women and the various issues that affect them all. I saw the movie on Lifetime and I couldn't take my eyes off of it. Just amazing. Nothing like that let down ""Kingdom Come"" that had all those good black actors/actresses and portrayed a negative image of black families. This movies shows the good, the bad, and the ugly of being a black woman and how we overcome our struggles. Buy this movie and be inspired.",1052524800,3,470,4.476744186046512
938646,2,6304846126,"Certainly, this film is excellent.  However, the version sold here is incomplete.  Several key scenes are missing including Cora and her children at _Midsummer Night's Dream_ and the infamous meatloaf scene.  One of the only drawbacks of our new virtual world is that you must buy something and open it before you find out it's not what you wanted.  There are two versions sold here; I bought the more expensive one, thinking it would be more comprehensive.  Buy the cheaper one!  You can't miss more than I've missed.",984182400,77,518,4.829545454545454

The film shakes and is larger than the screen dimensions even when you try to modify it to fit the screen. This film would not play on my blue ray player; good thing I had an older DVD player.

939305,5,6304846126,I just watched this DVD the other day.  I had only seen the original movies one time (that first airing of it).  So I didn't remember the story.  It was like seeing it for the first time.  I enjoyed the story and would purchase it again to give as a gift.,1401840000,,255,3.9411764705882355

939307,1,6304846126,"This DVD is listed as the uncut edition version of TV movie mini series.  There are so many original scenes that has been deleted it's totally a HUGE misrepresentation and misleading to list as being an uncut movie.  I was totally disappointed and should have read the reviews, however in my excitement to receive an uncut version I bypassed reviews.  THE REVIEW DON'T LIE! Many major scenes have been deleted, sliced, cut they simply are not here.  This is a BAIT AND SWITCH CUT VERSION, SO IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO PURCHASE THE MADE FOR TV ORIGINAL MINI SERIES THIS IS NOT IT!  IF YOU FIND THE ORIGINAL DVD BEFORE I DO PLEASE LET ME KNOW.",1394755200,6,637,4.456896551724138

939361,3,6304846126,A movie from back in the day. First Africa American couple that I'd ever seen. Donna Deitch directed their scene.,1385769600,,113,4.7
939362,5,6304846126,It is a good movie to watch when one wants to relax or be glad your life is on an even keel and not like people on the walled off street.  Makes you want look up and see where some of the actors are now.,1380326400,,203,3.511111111111111
939363,3,6304846126,"the edited version is missing at least a good 20 minutes or more of footage. I recommend buying the uncut edition especially to those that saw the Original airing when it was televised years ago. The quality of both versions is poor. The picture has scratch marks and hairlines throughout. The sound on a scale of 1-10 gets maybe about 5 and there are no subtitles.
Overall, if it wasn't for the fact that this is a great drama, I wouldn't recommend buying either versions. But, if you don't care too much about sound and picture quality and you are looking for a movie with a powerful story and great acting, I would recommend this to add to your collection. Perhaps in the future, it will be remastered to blu-ray. It deserves to be polished up and rereleased.",1375920000,2,762,4.528985507246377
939364,4,6304846126,"I like it for what it is, an edited version of the television mini series. There were several nuances missing that I was particularly looking for like the 360 degree camera rotation reflecting time passing right after Miss Eva's death.  The scene that begins with Basil as a toddler and ends with him as a young man.",1375660800,,316,4.543859649122807

939366,5,6304846126,The film is great because it shows ultimate unity amidst various biases.  This movie exemplifies my notion that time alters but never changes,1370044800,,141,5.130434782608695
939367,5,6304846126,"Several reviewers gave this VHS version a poor rating or only 1 star.  Most complained that this version was edited and chopped up and missing several key scenes of the original movie.  They are incorrect.  This is the full, unedited version of the original TV movie.  I would prefer to have it on DVD, but after reading the reviews, I'll just keep this copy and have it converted to DVD myself.

I don't need to go into detail about the movie, as probably anyone interested in buying it would have already seen it.  Needless to say, this is one of my all time favorite TV mini series movies.  The cast is stellar.  Every woman and man gives a superb performance, even the very young Larenz Tate did a wonderful job as one of Cora Lee's brood. I especially enjoyed Jackee Harry as Etta Mae Johnson.  One of my favorite scenes is where she is in attendance at the tenants' association meeting when she tells Miss Sophie, who had just insulted her, ""What's that supposed to mean?  You old prune pit!  Get on my nerve!""

One of the most emotional scenes is between Mattie and Ceil, after Ceil loses her baby to electrocution. Ceil is catatonic with grief and depression.  Mattie is determined to bring her back out of her darkness and tells her, ""Ceil, you can leave this world, but it will be over my dead body!""  The way Mattie forces Ceil to break down and sob is just heart wrenching and touching at the same time.  That scene is a testament to feminine compassion, strength and love. I can just feel the warmth and love in Mattie's embrace and rocking Ceil, commanding her to, ""Come on! Come on! Come on back, chile!  That's right. Come on back!""  I lose it every time...

To clarify:  BUY THE VHS version of this mini seriers, NOT THE DVD!  There is a huge difference.  The DVD is trash.  Key scenes are deleted.  Many folks probably don't even own a VCR or player anymore, but I strongly urge them to buy the VHS and then have it converted to DVD.  If you buy the DVD already edited, you will not be getting the full TV version and will miss many good and important scenes.",1369785600,,2077,4.405263157894737

I was anxiously awaiting its arrival and was a little disappointed to discover the out of sync ""version"" of the movie.",1359417600,,386,4.4714285714285715

939479,5,6304846126,When I saw this was a film that stared Oprah Winfrey I was hooked. I had to buy it. Oprah has played in some very good films. This one has some very strong performances not only by Oprah but most of the cast especially Robin Givens as Kiswana. A lot of what was experienced and many of the emotional themes I can relate to from personal experiences. I found this film to be one of the better ones that I have viewed in awhile. I recommend to young and old alike.,1344729600,,462,4.087912087912088
939480,5,6304846126,"Great acting. Solid performances by all. Perfectly executed in every way.

Having not seen this movie since it first aired on television many years ago, I didn't miss the edited parts that other reviewers are complaining about being missing from this DVD. If you check the details of the uncut version compared to this one, you'll find it only has an additional two minutes of air time. I didn't notice any ""choppiness due to bad editing"" in the movie. The film flowed smoothly.

If you're as unacquainted with The Women of Brewster Place as I was since it first came out, this version should be more than satisfactory for your viewing pleasure. If you've watched it on VHS over the years, you'll probably be disappointed that two minutes of film were left on the cutting room floor. (Why do they do that?)",1340841600,,806,4.669014084507042
939559,5,6304846126,"SO GLAD THE ORIGINAL TV VERSION WAS PUT ON DVD. I SAW THE MOVIE WHEN IT FIRST AIRED IN 1988 ON TV AND INSTANTLY KNEW IT WAS A KEEPSAKE IN MY MOVIE COLLECTION. LIKE SO MANY OTHERS, I RECORDED THE TV MOVIE ON VHS AS IT WAS AIRING AND MISPLACED THE VHS ALONG THE WAY OVER THE YRS SO WHEN I SAW IT WAS ON DVD I HAD TO HAVE IT. I BOUGHT THE EDITED VERSION FIRST AND WAS NOT HAPPY. NO I SAID, DONT CUT THE MEATLOAF SCENE, MIDSUMMER NIGHTS DREAM, AND A FEW OTHER SCENES CUT FROM THE MOVIE. WHAT I LIKED ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS I BELIEVED ALL WOMEN COULD IDENTIFY WITH AT LEAST ONE CHARACTER AND EVEN SEVERAL FOR DIFFERENT REASONS. THIS MOVIE SPEAKS TO ALL WOMEN AND MAKES US EXAMINE OUR OWN LIVES AND REALIZE NONE OF US ARE MUCH DIFFERENT FROM OTHERS BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE UPS AND DOWNS AND HAVE TO FIND OUT WHO WE ARE AS WOMEN AND UNDERSTAND OUR PLACE IN THE WORLD. ONCE WE DO THAT, AND STOP JUDGING EACH OTHER, WE CAN REALLY BE UNITED IN SISTERHOOD NO MATTER THE RACE, CLASS, BACKGROUND, SOCIAL ECONOMIC STATUS AND SO FORTH. WE SHOULD LEARN TO APPRECIATE EACH OTHER AND REALIZE WE ALL SERVE A PURPOSE ON THIS EARTH. BE THERE AND HELP EACH OTHER. I BOUGHT THIS VERSION RELIEVED I COULD SEE THE FAMOUS EDITED SCENES AGAIN. MAYBE IM TRIPPING BECAUSE I THOUGHT THERE WERE MORE SCENES FROM THE TV VERSION STILL MISSING IN THIS UNEDITED VERSION AS WELL OR MAYBE I IMAGINED MORE SCENES THAT DIDNT EXIST. I DONT KNOW. ALL IN ALL, TWO THUMBS UP FOR THIS MOVIE. ALL THE CHARACTERS WERE EXCELLENT. BESIDES THE FAMOUS ""MEATLOAF SCENE"", I LOVED THE ""TENANTS MEETING"" SCENE WHEN MISS SOPHIE GOT TOLD OFF FOR NOT MINDING HER BUSINESS AND GOT CALLED AN OLD BAT BY JACKEE' AND SHE AND JESSIE LEFT THE MEETING.

Another scene that is deleted is when Mattie's son Basil is in Jail and she comes to visit him and he's begging his mother to bail him out of jail.

939646,5,6304846126,"I just watched this movie for the first time, in its entirety, and I must say that it is one of the most powerful and inspiring movies I've ever seen. The Women of Brewster Place is a very underrated movie, and deserved far more recognition and exposure than it initially received. There were many stellar performances throughout the movie and there wasn't a bad moment throughout. Some moments were funny, some were sad and emotional, and some just truly made you open your mind and think, and that's part of the brilliance of this movie.

After watching this movie, I felt there was still more to this story that viewers wanted and needed to see. I would've been glad to watch more, because this movie was without a doubt, truly amazing from the beginning all the way to the very end. The Women of Brewster Place is definitely a classic and I definitely recommend anyone who has not viewed this before to give it a chance, because I think you'll definitely enjoy these amazing characters and their stories, and even learn some important life lessons along the way.

Thank you Amazon for finding the UNEDITED version of this movie and offering it to your customers, finally!!! . Thank You for the great price as well!!!",1304380800,7,1220,4.669767441860465

939648,5,6304846126,"In this powerful adaptation of Gloria Naylor's award-winning novel, a star-studded cast fuels the tale of seven women whose lives and stories intertwine as they struggle through triumphs, losses, heartaches, joys, sorrows, friendships, love, and more. The film stars Oprah Winfrey (Who executively produced the film), Lynn Whitfield, Jackee, Robin Givens, Phyllis Yvonne Stickney, Lonette McKee, and Paula Kelly.

Anyone who saw the miniseries back in 1989 knows what a wonderful film this is. I'm sure you even recognize the beautiful performances made by the cast. However, anyone who has tried to purchase the film knows what an awful transition it made to VHS and DVD. For reasons that are still unknown to me, several important scenes were chopped out of the film, most notably the ""meatloaf"" scene. Believe me, I wasn't the only one angered at the poor treatment this miniseries received for home viewing.

But for anyone wondering if this DVD is the real deal, FEAR NOT!!!! This is just the version of Brewster Place that you've been looking for! All the scenes you've been missing since the original broadcast are here, which includes:

Mattie talking to Ms. Cleo about taking a longer break to check on her son, Basil.

Mattie, Ciel, and Basil discovering Ms. Eva dead in her home.

Mattie's brief discussion with one of her clients at the salon.

Mattie visiting Basil in jail after his incarceration.

An extended version of Mattie's wait for Basil (Before later realizing that he's run away)

A scene showing Cora Lee's dysfunctional relationship with her children.

Mattie, Ciel, and Etta's conversation walking back from the grocery store.

Kiswana's holding the first Tenants Association Meeting.

An extended version of Cora Lee preparing her children to watch A Midsummer Night's Dream with Kiswana.

The performance of A Midsummer Night's Dream.

A scene where Tee helps a little girl who scraped her knee and is then reproached by the girl's mother.

The infamous ""meatloaf"" scene.

A scene where Mattie discusses Tee and Lorraine while doing Etta's hair in her kitchen.

For anyone who has or hasn't seen the original broadcast of the film, the inclusion of these important scenes make a HUGE difference! I would highly recommend that anyone who loves this miniseries and the original novel to buy THIS version of the film, because it's the one that should have been available during that past 20 years!!!

If anyone has any more questions, feel free to ask! In the meantime, enjoy ""The Women of Brewster Place!""",1300233600,58,2532,5.062650602409638

939767,4,6304846126,"Being too young to watch Brewster Place when it originally aired in 1989, I had the pleasure of seeing it when I was older and it's one of my favorite tv miniseries ever. Based on Gloria Naylor's award winning 1982 novel, The Women of Brewster Place chronicles the lives and struggles of seven black women in the bleak, 60's era inner city neighborhood Brewster Place.

Daytime talk diva Oprah Winfrey (who also served as producer) stars as Mattie Michael, a middle aged woman  who's had her fair share of pain and disappointment. Shunned by her parents after becoming a teen mom, Mattie is forced to move once more to the rundown housing project after her young son is accused of murder and flees authorities, causing her to lose her home. She quickly becomes the matriarch of the community, viewed as a source of strength and comfort to the other women.

Jackee Harry (of 227 and Sister, Sister fame) is Mattie's man hungry, love starved friend Etta Mae Johnson. Desperately longing for security and stability, she moves from one louse to the next until she settles into Brewster Place. Robin Givens portrays Melanie ""Kiswana"" Browne, a naive, idealistic girl who abandons her privileged middle class upbringing and college education to find her ""black roots"" in Brewster Place. She makes it her mission to bring social change to the neighborhood, no matter how challenging and impossible it seems. Screen legend Cicely Tyson has a short scene as Kiswana's dissaproving mother, but she uses her time to shine with an amazing monologue.

Ciel Turner (Lynn Whitfield), the granddaughter of a kind woman who took Mattie and her son into her home many years ago, is a young wife and mother struggling to keep her family together. However, she loses it all in order to find herself. Cora Lee (Phyllis Yvonne Stickney) is the neglectful mother of a brood of rowdy kids (think the 60's version of Octomom) always causing a ruckus for the neighbors. Obsessed with baby dolls since childhood, the woman thinks of her own children as dolls when they're infants, but loses interest in them once they're older.

Lorraine (Lonette McKee) is one half of a lesbian couple who feels unwelcomed by many in the community. Her partner Theresa (Paula Kelly) couldn't care less about being judged, but Lorraine's need for acceptance is consuming and she befriends Ben (Moses Gunn), friendly older man who genuinely cares for her. Unfortunately the mean and spiteful gossip Miss Sophie (Olivia Cole) enjoys causing trouble for the couple by spreads all kinds of vicious rumors about them. She gets put in her place soon enough though.

A shocking act of violence brings everyone in the community together and gives them the power to fight back against racism, homophobia, violence against women, drugs, and other struggles of inner city life.

The acting is truly remarkable. You feel for all of the characters (even Miss Sophie to a degree) and root for them to overcome the corruption and hopelessness surrounding them. It's painful to see Lorraine yearning for acceptance from the other tenants and being shot down at every turn. Poor Ciel about to lose her sanity when all that is near and dear to her is destroyed, but Mattie does everything in her power to pull her back from the brink.

My only gripe (and a very big one) is that many key scenes are cut out of this DVD edition. I won't rehash them all, but it's annoying and plain unfair to pay for a movie you love with certain scenes missing. Instead of buying this edition, look for the Original Uncut Version released this past February. It's much better when you get to see this moving drama in its entirety.",1237420800,,3651,4.821086261980831

I would still suggest that you purchase it for the sheer brillance of the story and performances, but If you remember the original, those deleted scenes might be an issue for you.",1189987200,2,569,4.428571428571429

But this is just a stilted mess, with one scene jerking into the next, no character development ... really a disappointment.  The acting is flat; no affect -  As if saying the lines and raising eyebrows is enough.

I will not get this DVD, because I believe you all when you say they screwed up this DVD.

How marvelous to see the younger Oprah Winfrey of 1988 when this was made, portraying the strong matriarchial character nurturing the six other women whose lives give snapshots of differing approaches to living--approaches that respond to life problems and give rise to both further problems and answers.

How marvelous to have this thoughtful, rich portraal of characters and life situations in the African-American community. How marvelous, when they pick up those crow bars at the end and tear down that wall.

I saw it again recently on the Lifetime Channel and decided to purchase the DVD. To my great disappointment, there were quite a few scenes that were deleted!!!!  I have no idea what they were thinking when they decided to botch this movie.

Scenes deleted include Mattie finding Ms Eva dead, Basil complaining about the prision conditions, the kids going to see the play, Theresa helping the little girl who fell, and the ""meatloaf incident"". Other scenes are cut short. This DVD definitely disappointed.",1143072000,4,461,4.634146341463414

I thought I remembered a sequel but maybe it's just because of the missing scenes.  It seemed like there were too many storylines left hanging.

The acting was fabulous though.  It's definitely one of the ""must see"" miniseries.",1142640000,,445,4.714285714285714
939918,3,6304846126,"Rest assured, the 3 stars are not about the actual movie (the movie is wonderful), it is because of the terrible DVD!!!  I just got the DVD and was surprised that scenes were missing that i remember when it came on tv years ago.  One scene I distinctly remember was when her son went to jail and he was complaining about how bad conditions were.  What I can't understand is why they would take out scenes.  My only guess is that they did not want to use a dual layer disc and they did not want to use 2 discs.  I think it would have been well worth it to put out a version with all of the scenes and maybe even extras.  I think it just stinks as it stands.  They need to re-release the disc properly.  Right now, I feel gypped.

Oh yeah, I just thought of another scene that is missing, when Eva died and the kids were left outside after school.  Why did they leave that out?  Oh well, I am sure there are other scenes, I just can't remember them all.  What a bummer!",1141430400,4,967,4.058201058201059
940015,4,6304846126,"I'm sorry to say I never saw the uncut version of this movie, nor have I gotten around to reading the book (yet), but I bought this movie a few weeks ago and couldn't tear myself away.  If anybody loves women's issues in any context, it's yours truly, and this movie made a huge impact on me.

Oprah Winfrey always has her heart in the right place, even if she often seems to choose projects that come up short in the eyes of others.  Hey, I like Oprah, but I don't love her like others seem to do, and she CAN act.  I found her performance as Mattie Michael both touching and strong.  In fact, I wanted to beat her daddy with something worse than the broom he attacked her with, and I think Mattie was an amazingly strong woman in the face of all her woes.  Hell, I would have crumpled in 20 minutes!

The Women of Brewster place shows a community of people--not just the women--who have little materialistically, but are rich in friendship and concern for each other.  My favorite characters would have to be Luciela (played by the underrated and extremely talented Lynn Whitfield) and her sad situation with a selfish husband, and the middle class girl Kiswana (Robin Givens) who really tries hard to make a difference as she turns her back a bit unfairly on her priviledged upbringing.  Cicely Tyson is only in the movie for 5 minutes, but what a great performance she turns in as she tells her daughter Kiswana/Melanie  what's what.  Her performance made me want to stand up and cheer, but I also understood that Kiswana had to follow her heart and try to make that difference.

The movie made me laugh, cry, and think, but most of all it brought across one crucial point:  people can tear down the walls of oppression if they stand together rather than just let a few people do it alone in vain.  That is a very good, encouraging message indeed.",1136678400,4,1851,4.454005934718101

In the book the events in the scene flow together nicely. It had a lot of details and great descriptions. But in the movie the scene wasn't presented well. The events in the scene didn't flow together well. The two characters also don't look very real. The conversation they have looks rehearsed. Plus the reactions and facail expressions don't seem as real during the scene as they do in the book. The way Mattie was acting looked pretty fake and rehearsed.
