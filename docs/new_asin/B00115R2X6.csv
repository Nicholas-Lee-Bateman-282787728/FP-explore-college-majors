8528562,4,B00115R2X6,I have hundreds of UFO related DVDs and I am happy to report that this one is a keeper. It has alot we have not heard before. It does get a little redundant but well worth the low prices!,1367280000,,187,3.8205128205128207
8528563,5,B00115R2X6,"Watching Charlie Hickson talk about his Alien Abduction is an amazing experience in itself. It reminds me that there are still some very honest and sincere people left in this world. Watching his presentation, the interview with him and the documentary-style segment about the Pascagoula UFO Abductions case makes it easy to see how much is being hid and kept away from the public regarding the UFO phenomenon. This DVD is terrific because it isn't just about Hickson and Parker's Abduction, it is also about the subsequent air force cover up and police mishandling of the case. This is a classic case and one rarely talked about these days. This is must-see for anyone that wants the truth about UFOs and is tired of all the junk about aliens and extraterrestrials on cable TV.",1242604800,,778,4.813432835820896
