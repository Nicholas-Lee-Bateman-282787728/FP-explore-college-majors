She obviously draws from a wealth of knowledge garnered from numerous lineages of yoga and is able to transfer information not only with the precision of someone who thoroughly knows her science but with the fluidity and poetry of an artist.  I have lots of yoga dvds from so called celebrity teachers and Jennifer Lynn's is one of the most comprehensively excellent - beautifully produced, lovely music, clear easy to understand direction, plenty of instruction:  ancient teachings delivered beautifully in thoroughly modern technicolor and sound.",1204761600,4,633,5.494845360824742
3111297,5,B0013HXB1O,"Flow Yoga with Jennifer Lynn is a DVD that will not let you down.  Jennifer guides you through whatever type of practice you are feeling for the day, be it beginner or advanced or just a breakdown of the body alignment.  Her voice is soothing and easy to understand.  I have had the honor of taking class with Jennifer in person, so to be able to take her home and practice daily with her is such a beautiful treat.  What is nice about this DVD is that the advanced practice really makes you sweat and challenges your entire being.  For people new to the Anusara principles or for all you Anusara heads out there this video is for you!  Sweat, expand, open your heart and flow with Jennifer Lynn, you won't be sorry you did!",1204675200,9,724,4.325925925925926
3111298,5,B0013HXB1O,"I have many yoga dvd's and practice daily. This is a lovely and intense workout. Like Shiva Rea in terms of the style,with well done sequences. A great addition, if you like a good workout.",1204416000,7,189,4.428571428571429
3111299,5,B0013HXB1O,"This is an awesome power, flow yoga practice! Well organized, and professionally produced. The DVD has 4 main chapters an Introduction, Beginner's Flow (45 minutes) with 10 chapter segments, Intermediate Advanced Flow (75 minutes) with 4 sections called ""Quarters"" that is further broken down into 4 segments to choose from and and Alignment Principles section.

In the Intro section Jennifer begins with an inspiring message (this is usually the section of a DVD I usually skip but for some reason it flipped to it and I listened for a change and it was a delight). She reminds us that  living is a life of balance between purposeful, balanced, responsible living in union with joyful, passionate, exuberant living. Even though she doesn't mention God, it still reminded me that that's exactly the life God intends and wants for all of us.

I loved her 75 minute Intermediate/Advanced flow! The setting is both inside a studio and outside in a grassy park with scenes switching gently back and forth. It's shot in a very professional way with great camera work. She leads with a number of students with an amazing voiceover and great music in the background. It is a challenging power flow with an almost dancelike flowing feel to it especially in the beginning (her transitions move in and out of poses fluidly and beautifully). There will also be a good enough amount of vinyasa's (chatarunga, updog, downdog) to get the blood pumping and the body warm. Her incredible voice over has amazing cueing and is calming, with great direction while also inpiring, for example,  ""welcome challenge as you reach up, surrender to grace bowing in, inhale readiness look forward, exhale poise step back or float back""(yet funny enough without coming off as cheesy or sappy). None of her awesome voiceover slows down the flow in any way. She also likes to throw in some great handbalancing and inverted poses throughout, which I love (Quarter section 1: side crow, crow; Quarter section 2: one-legged crow or crane; Quarter section 3: sage 2 pose, side plank to wheel, dolphin to forarm stand, headstand; Quarter section 4: one-legged sage 1 to tripod headstand).

Overall this is an amazing practice and worth every 5 stars!! She's up there with the best of them: Eoin Finn, Bryan Kest (1st dvd's), Shiva Rae, Inhale yoga (Oxygen TV, funky music Steve Ross), Mark Blanchard, Baron Baptiste, Donna Helm-Yost (Flow and Yin), Yoga Radiance, Yogatopia, MTV Power Yoga, Power Yoga for Strength & Endurance, XFlowsion, etc.",1204243200,37,2508,4.990430622009569

The only problem with the production was the breaks in between the segments was way too long and you can't fast forward through it.

I loved the way two classes became one:the dvd immersed you in a nature, and then flowed back to an indoor setting- the inner and outer were beautifully balanced.

The flow sequences were unique,as a long time practitioner (not so much anymore) of ashtanga vinyasa (a flow yoga), the routines were alive and seemed to come spontaneously, not a forced movement for the mind to follow.

On a trip to Maui with my sister in early December of 2014, I took one of her classes.  I have take the occasional yoga class, and always enjoyed them, but I have never stuck to it. I tend to not be very athletic and pretty lazy.

I enjoyed her class immensely.  I cannot claim to remember right now what Jennifer said during class that touched me so deeply, only that it did.  I remember trying to tell her as much that day, and also taking her postcard.  Two years later, I am still trying to get fit and healthy.  (I will turn 40 in June and I am currently at my most unhealthy weight ever - at least sixty pound overweight, and finally starting to feel the effects on my knees and joints).

I looked Jennifer up and saw that she had this DVD.  I bought it right away!  Of course, that was over six months ago, and I didn't bother to do anything until three weeks ago.

I am finally starting to built a good practice by using the Wisdom Flow Yoga DVD.  I had started with doing about 20 minutes in the morning and then 30... what ever my scheduled and strength allowed.  But, now I am finally doing the whole Beginner Routine.

I Love that this DVD is broken up into a few parts.  There is a wonderful 45 minutes Beginner workout.  A longer Intermediate/Advanced workout.  And introduction by Jennifer which explains a few principles of Wisdom Flow, and a section that walks you through adjustments.

I know that I have only just begun to follow this path, and that it is going to take a lot of hard work and practice to see results.  But I am more confident than I have ever been before that I can succeed.

I hope that I can visit Maui again some day in the future and take a few more classes with Jennifer!

Also,  I want to say thank you to Jennifer.  Thank you so much for your class that day, a little over two years ago.  Thank you for your DVD, Videos, and classes in general.  Thank you for everything that you're accomplishing through your Yoga practice.

And remember, If you're on of those people who thinks ""Yoga doesn't work for me"".

Yesterday I had the following thought after I finished the video...  ""Yoga doesn't work FOR you, you WORK for Yoga.""",1487980800,,2380,4.2383073496659245
8251061,1,B0013HXB1O,"There are so many DVD that are better, all of shiva Reas are far superior, Rodney Yee, etc.. The real deal is Shiva Rea, who teaches from her heart and soul and it is not copy cat of John Friends work.

8251062,2,B0013HXB1O,"The beginer workout is for someone who has never done any form of yoga before. It was beyond easy. The intermediate/advanced workout is great for me. Its a challenge, without it being impossible. The narration though is really really bad. ""With love and a willingness to be one with the world, become friends with your left leg.""  In other words, hug your left leg. She does preach to you a lot through out the workouts and also in an opening segment in the begining. I didn't like that but i just ignore what she says anyways since it makes no sence. I don't think i would recomend it to my friends.",1377561600,,600,4.405405405405405
8251063,3,B0013HXB1O,"For someone who has some experience in yoga the beginners section was a little too slow so I cannot comment for beginners at yoga.
Overall the intermediate/advanced section was honestly a bit confusing to follow at the pace. For me, this was mainly because the commentary is quite fluffed up by 'opening the heart into so-and-so position' phrases. For me, I need to know which position and what you're doing physically when following a video  without having to crane your head out of the position (and risk straining something) to watch what she is doing. I'd recommend Rodney Yee's 'Power Yoga Total Body'for this, although it is not as challenging and doesn't contain the variety of poses as in this one. While I acknowledge more advanced yogis would benefit from the extra extensions of the positions, this was often at the disadvantage to not nearly as bendy people as myself and there were times when I was not sure what would be a good position to stay in. Occasionally when the video flipped back between inside and outside, there were timing differences making it difficult to follow. Two suggestions for this video: more straight forward commentary or slow the pace, and consistently show more intermediate poses (maybe by dividing the screen).
However, when I did get it, she has a good variety of positions and her emphasis on pushing that bit further to challenge oneself was beneficial. It is split into 4 sections so you can choose a shorter session too. The positioning section was informative but limited to the basic positions.",1325548800,,1544,4.893129770992366

8251065,5,B0013HXB1O,"I have numerous vinyasa flow DVDs, and this one is definitely a favorite.  Her cues are phenomenal and the series of poses are linked together beautifully.  The longer sequence is definitely advanced; while I cannot do some of the poses yet (forearm stand, for example), I feel I will be able to if I keep practicing and listening to her cueing.  The beginner sequence is great as well - again, very instructive and great to throw in every once in a while for a gentler flow.",1277078400,3,475,4.5
8251066,5,B0013HXB1O,"This is my favorite yoga routine. It is really challenging and varied, with lots of interesting sequences. There are a lot of challenging backbends, strength poses, and forearm stands. You will not master this disc quickly!  There is a beginner's routine (which I have never done), a 75 minute intermediate routine, and some pose commentary, etc.

I see that some have commented that the photography is not so professional. OK. It's true. They filmed the routine both indoors and outdoors and kind of interlaced them a bit. The outdoor shots are lousy, but the indoor ones are OK. Jenifer is teaching a class and you get to see how many of her students can't do the poses. However, I would say SO WHAT about the mediocre filming, because this is a great, challenging workout!  I have a lot of discs, and mostly, I don't use them because they are all far too easy. This disc is not too easy, and there is a lot of interesting variety and poses and stretches that I have not seen elsewhere.

But what makes this disc super special is Jennifer's beautiful commentary. It is both instructive and deep, and geared for western minds, so you won't hear too much about the sun--it's more about personal growth.",1264464000,3,1202,4.65566037735849
8251067,5,B0013HXB1O,"This DVD offers challenging yoga for beginners and advanced yogis. The beginner's sequence is shorter and well-instructed, but it is also challenging enough for a more advanced yogi if they are in a hurry or a bit worn out. Her advanced sequence is very challenging. All four quarters can be done together or separately. Either way, someone with yoga experience will be challenged. I can rarely make a yoga class, so this is a good alternative for me to continue my practice and grow as a yogi. I am so happy that I found this DVD.",1254960000,,531,4.541666666666667

Great video, buy it. Also buy Bryan Kest Power Yoga- great as well.",1230508800,,282,4.64

What I love about Jennifer's dvd is that she gets you into poses you thought you could never do. The stretching is sublime!  This is the beauty of anusara yoga. I haven't done flow yoga in years so the intermediate flow was super challenging to me.  I watched the beginning flow and there is such a wide gap between the beginning flow and the intermediate flow, that if you are a complete novice, I don't know how you bridge the gap.  Bi-weekly live classes, I suppose.  Jennifer's cuing is impecable.  I loved seeing other people in the class with varying abilities.  Definitely a new favorite yoga dvd.

My only major complaint is that the production quality sucks.  The picture was grainy; the long pauses between quarters was annoying and the 3rd time I used the dvd it froze and I had to re-start the dvd.  I cleaned my player and I hope that the freezing doesn't happen again.  Sometimes in the replication process, the dvd degrades with each copying process, expecially when inexpensive media is used. Not saying that this is the case.  But I see that another reviewer's dvd froze too.

By the way, the menu, OMG!  You have the chapter titles listed on the top, pictures in the middle and play listed on the bottom.  In order to get the right chapter you have to get chapter, picture and play highlighted.  It took me a few minutes playing with my remote to get that figured out.  For her next dvd, I suggest that she make the menu simpler.  She has so much to offer as a teacher, and these flaws are distracting.

Overall, I loved the content.  The pace was good.  She is talky so be forewarned!! Lots of spiritual metaphors, but I am used to that as my yoga background is kundalini yoga.  Great anusara yoga class inspite of the quality!

UPDATE:  I just did the beginners class and it is wonderful!  This morning I felt like I needed an easy yoga class and this is it.  Half sun salutes, tree, wide angle forward bend, heros pose and shoulder stretch, cobra, locust, to name a few.  45 minutes of bliss with a sublime closing pose of supported backbend lying over 2 blocks and words of wisdom.  Please Jennifer make another anusara dvd soon.",1228521600,4,2268,4.47921760391198
