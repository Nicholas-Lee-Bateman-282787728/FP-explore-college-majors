327765,5,6301328450,"Lucky Partners is a long neglected little treasure. Director Lewis Milestone gave this film a light touch to match a warm and humorous story and the lilting charms of its two stars, Ronald Colman and Ginger Rogers. They are wonderful together in this film.

When David Grant (Colman) wishes good luck to passerby Jean Newton (Rogers) for no particular reason at all, things immediately start to go her way. So she cooks up a plan to split a racing ticket that's a million-to-one shot with caricature artist Grant, thinking she might just win. Grant's one stipulation, however, is that Jean go on a sort of honeymoon with him should they win, even though she already has a fiance!

Jean balks, of course, but Grant charms both she and her fiance, Freddie (Jack Carson), into this experiment, as he calls it, and it isn't long before the two find themselves falling in love. The disarming charm of Rogers and Colman and the warmth Milestone ellicits from the story Bonnie Chance by Sacha Guitry carry this film with ease.

A dark haired Ginger and the suave Colman have a nice chemistry and there are some truly magic moments in this film. Colman carrying Rogers over the ""Threshold to Whatever You Want"" at the request of an older couple and a courtroom scene in which David and Jean question each other on the witness stand about everything and nothing immediately come to mind.

Spring Byington as Ginger's aunt and Harry Davenport as the old judge more than a little smitten and protective of Jean enhance an already delightful film. A nice score from Dimitri Tiomkin creates just the right mood at the right time in this very special film from the 1940's you'll enjoy a lot.",1112659200,18,1677,4.713310580204778
327766,5,6301328450,"fresh off her Astaire-Rogers phenomenon, and after her incredible success as Ellie-May Adams in Primrose Path, Miss Ginger Rogers gives another wonderfully wonderful performance. She and Coleman have more than wonderful chemistry together, him with his formalness, and her informal charm. Some say her hair was too dark in this film, but I must disagree. It goes to show, that despite the hair color, Ginger was a really wonderful actress. This point is often overlooked, but she didn't win an Oscar for ""Kitty Foyle"" for nothing. Afterall, it's not the hair, but her INCREDIBLE eyes that work so well. (This goes for every single picture she's in) Ginger had the most incredible, most expressive eyes to ever grace hollywood. She could talk through her eyes, if you cover up the sound and the rest of the face and leave only her eyes, you can tell everything that she is saying. Anyway, back to the picture. It's interesting to note that ""lucky partners"" is actually very racy for 1940. The whole point of the movie is that Ginger goes on a ""honeymoon"" with Ronald Coleman, even though she is engaged to jack carson. Also in the apartment, we see Rogers lying face on her bed is a very suggestive position. One of the most touching point in the film is when he carries her off to ""the threshhold of whatever you want"" while in his arms, and while still walking, he kisses her. Their sensational chemistry really makes this moment work. Afterwards, Ginger's eyes reflect everything and more that just happened. Later, at the end of the film, is where the censors of the day had problems. They state that Ronald Coleman made love to Ginger. Usually they mean kissing, but they specifically say ""you kissed this women, and made love to her"" there is no getting around it, they mean sex. It's hard to understand now why that's such a big deal, but this was 1940, and sex was not an acceptable topic open for dicussion. So when Ronald Coleman says that he did have sex with Roger's character, it surprised an ol movie buff like me, because this wasn't the popular ideas that were used in films. However, this is a delightful film, and I highly recommend it.",1098835200,8,2153,4.683377308707124
327767,3,6301328450,"""Lucky Partners"" for a 1940s film doesn't seem to reach the heights comedies of its period reach. It's rather bland when compared to such classic comdies as ""Bringing Up Baby"", ""The Awful Truth"", and ""The Philadelphia Story"".
 ""Lucky Partners"" starts off rather well. It's a story about Jean Newton who comes into contact with David Grant (Ronald Coleman). One day Grant, for no reason at all, offers Jean some good luck. As soon as that happens Jean seems to feel that some good luck has finally come her way. She then gets an idea that if Grant and her would go in halves on a sweepstakes ticket there's a good chance they'll win.
 The overall problem I have with the film is, it loses its focus. It switches gears and goes from a fast paced ""screwball comedy""-ish film and deserts the comedy for a love story. A movie doesn't need to do that in order to work. ""Bringing Up Baby"" or ""His Girl Friday"" prove this point. There were two films that never lessened the comedic aspects and proved to have romantic as well as funny scenes throughout.
 The movies was directed by Lewis Milestone, probably best know for directing the Oscar winner ""All Quite On The Western Front"" as well as ""Of Mice And Men"" and ""Ocean's Eleven"". But, as good a director some may argue Milestone was, he was not known as a comedy filmmaker. I wonder if he truly understood what makes a comedy work. This is not to say the movie doesn't not have any laughs. It's the supporting characters who mostly offer them. Jean's boyfriend Freedie (Jack Carson) and her aunt Lucy (Spring Byington).
 If you chose to watch this film mainly because you want to watch Ginger Rogers without Fred Astaire, take my word for it, there are better films to watch. I prefer George Steven's ""Vivacious Lady"", Howard Hawk's ""Monkey Bussiness"", and Billy Wilder's ""The Major & the Minor"".
 Bottom-line: Although at times amusing ""Lucky Partners"" never seems to blend together correctly. Compared with other comedies of its time seems rather bland. The stars do what they can.",1080345600,5,2028,4.701408450704226
327768,5,6301328450,"I don't want to give away the plot for this wonderful film, so I'll just comment on how good it is! Jack Carson gives great support (as usual) to the stars, Ginger Rogers & Ronald Colman, in this well crafted romantic comedy. Filmed in 1941, it was sort of an in-between film for both Ginger & Ronald (Kitty Foyle, 1940 for Rogers & Random Harvest, 1942 for Colman), but don't think for a minute that the stars didn't give it all they had--they were both at top form.

327822,5,6301328450,"In the '30's and '40's before super special effects, I believe actors and actresses had to be better at their skill in order to make their points on film.  These early players could show pages of dialogue just through facial expressions alone.  No words had to be spoken in order to let a viewer know how the actor was feeling.

Today people are distracted by very good special effects and perhaps miss the lesser quality of acting.  There are present day performers who are as good as yesteryear.  However, rule of thumb, those from the Golden Age of Hollywood are much much better than today's performers.

Miss Rogers and Mr. Colman had tremendous chemistry on stage displaying very subtle human interactions without the ""in your face, jump in to bed"" stories seen in present day romantic comedies.  Movie makers of old left something to the imagination.

Rogers is typically great as in most her other romantic comedies showing legitimate worry and curiosity at the same time with Colman's character.  The two make a nice pair on film and the story is a nice plot up until a rather drawn out, and silly court drama unfolds.

Since we are buying these for the movies, you have to accept that is all you are going to get.  They didn't do a lot of interviews, the making of ..., etc when these movies were made.  My only objection is the price they charge for these movies.  Most of them are not remastered, there is no extra cost put into the movies, and they are burned as needed so they haven't spent a great deal of money creating vast numbers of unsold copies floating around.  They are just overpriced!  That being said, I still enjoy many of these old movies.  If I'm lucky I will find enough of the really good ones and I can stop buying them

As I said, I am a big Ginger Rogers fan.  She may have become more well known for her dancing with Fred Astaire, but there was a lot more to Ginger Rogers as an actress.  She was a very versatile actress.  I started out loving her comedic roles and dancing, but found that she could play serious even heart wrenching roles beautifully.  This is not my favorite movie-Kitty Foyle, Primrose Path, and Stage Door all show her acting abilities much better, but this movie did have something special about it.  Ronald Coleman was a good choice for his character; he always brought a certain class to the roles he played.

327852,5,6301328450,"""Lucky Partners"" is one of a small list of ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIES. My daughters Joanna, Amelia and I have watched this movie together for decades. I think Amelia was one when she first saw it; Joanna was 7.

Joanna, now 28, just told me she plans to design her wedding gown based on an outfit Ginger Rogers wore in ""Lucky Partners.""

I had thought myself capable of writing this review myself. This is an urbane romantic comedy. Joanna says it is a satire on morality within a [cell phone static] within a comedy. As the battery on her phone dies, she starts quoting from the incredibly funny and brilliant lines from ""Lucky Partners."" There is, for example, the opening meeting between Ronald Coleman and Ginger Rogers.

Ronald Coleman plays the role of a brilliant artist who aristocratically refuses to continue painting in Ronald-Coleman-incredible-diction. (I will never forget Ronald Coleman, in that incredible scene just before they cut off his head in Charles Dickens' Tale of Two Cities: ""It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever ever done. It is a far far better world I go to than I have ever ever known."" [Boy, I wish I could talk like that.]

Coleman also has eccentric ideas about the institution of matrimony and honeymoons in particular (which he explains to his art dealer who is trying to convince Ronald Coleman to return to painting).

Instead, Coleman then leaves the building, walks down the street and passes the adorable [astonishingly adorable] Ginger Rogers. For no apparent reason, Ronald Coleman wishes Ginger Rogers, a total stranger, ""Good luck."" ""Did you just wish me luck for no apparent reason?""

As Joanna's cell phone dies as she drives home with her fiance Jade Kosmos Phillips, Joanna says, ""Did you just wish me luck for no apparent reason?""

In this movies Ronald passes Ginger in the street and simply says ""Good Luck"" where many say ""Hello"" he changes it up a bit and catches her attention. Ginger goes on her way and someone gives her a beautiful gown.  Then she gets the idea to get Ronald to go in with her on a sweep stake ticket.

Directed by Lewis Milestone

Ronald Colman shares a sweepstakes ticket with Ginger Rogers and they then embark on an ""imaginary"" honeymoon with their ""winnings.""

As David Grant passes neighbor Jean Newton on the street in Greenwich Village, he impulsively wishes her good luck. Although she doesn't know him, she intuitively asks him to become her partner in an Irish sweepstakes ticket. David agrees on the condition that she go on a world tour with him if they win the $150,000 prize as an ""experiment.""

She reluctantly agrees over the initial objections of her oafish fianc Frederick Harper (Jack Carson), who agrees to hold the ticket. When it turns out that they have drawn a horse in the race, Fred urges them to sell the ticket for the $12,000 asking price, but they turn him down. Although their horse loses, Jean is furious to learn that Fred had sold her half of the ticket. Even though David doesn't know about it, she feels obligated to share the $6000 with him.

After he buys her a car with her half, she agrees to a scaled-down version of their tour to Niagara Falls, where they register as brother and sister. What Jean doesn't know is that David is actually a famous painter living under an assumed name after serving three years in prison.

Jack Carson plays his role of jilted fianc perfectly, pulls it off quite nicely which says a lot about him being a versatile actor.

There was a lot of charm in the courtroom scenes, with the endearing Harry Davenport as judge, who sorts out the legal and romantic complications for all concerned, he really shines here.  Of course who could forget his role as Grandpa Prophater to Judy Garland in Meet Me in St. Louis (1944).

Special footnote: -- Ginger Rogers turned down the role of Hildy Johnson (eventually played by Rosalind Russell) in the Howard Hawks comedy His Girl Friday so she could co-star with Ronald Colman in this film.

327855,5,6301328450,"I had to post an opposing (positive) review for ""Lucky Partners"", as I love this film! Sure, the story would likely never happen in real life, but it's a movie, and it's fun. Ronald Colman's good-humored charm and Ginger Rogers' peppy cheerfulness -- basically, what we love about each of them (as seen in so many of their roles) -- make the film a delight and the protagonists worthy of affection. And the supporting actors are great: Jack Carson, as the jealous fianc, and Spring Byington, as the dotty aunt, are particularly memorable, and Harry Davenport makes an appearance, too. So, if you love the charming, witty, sweet, slightly zany films of the 1930s-40s (like ""Holiday"", ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"", ""The Thin Man"", etc.), or if you love Colman and/or Rogers, you should enjoy this one.",1313193600,14,795,4.810218978102189

However, through much trial and error I've learned that they are very much a hit or miss.  And in my humble opinion, this movie falls into the ""miss"" category.  It stars Ginger Rogers, oddly enough, as a brunette.  It give her a very Scarlett O'Hara/Vivien Leigh look which is pretty interesting.  However, the plot is simply bizarre as it unfolds.  It opens up with Ginger meeting a stranger as she is walking down the streets of New York who wishes her simply ""Good luck!""  Well, she happens to have good luck and so she meets up with this same guy again to purchase a sweepstakes ticket.  The fellow as portrayed by Ronald Colman comes across as a fellow a young girl should best stay away from.  But as the plot works out, Ginger finds herself going on a vacation with this really convoluted way of talking older man.  Suffice it to say, I and the person I was watching this movie with, simply didn't remain interested in the film.  So, if you wish to try it, please do.  But I'm going to have to be a naysayer on this one.",1304812800,4,1182,4.371559633027523
327857,4,6301328450,"Jean Newton (Ginger Rogers) is walking down the street in Greenwich Village and a strange man wishes her ""good luck"" for no apparent reason.  She has a bit of good luck immediately afterwards, and the man, an artist named David Grant (Ronald Colman) quickly enters her life, and, in typical screwball comedy fashion, offers to take her away from a life of dullness with fiancee Frederick Harper (Jack Carson), who wants to take her off to a staid existence in Poughkeepsie.  Grant has other plans, which are apparent when the two ""lucky partners"" go in on a sweepstakes ticket on a major horse race.  If they win, Grant will use his half of the winnings to take Newton on a chaste brother-sister trip, the ""honeymoon"" she won't get with boring, businesslike Frederick.  Obviously, complications ensue when they do in fact win a prize...

LUCKY PARTNERS (1940) isn't one of the best of the romantic farces of this period, perhaps the best for such films in American cinema, but it's a pretty solid effort supported by a fine cast.  I like Carson especially, doing his typical good-hearted dolt character, pleasant but obviously not the right guy for Ginger Rogers!  Sure, Colman is on the old-ish side, but unlike his role in, say,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Random-Harvest/dp/B0006B2AA6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Random Harvest</a>&nbsp;(a much better film overall, despite Colman's inability to convince as a young army officer) a couple of years later it doesn't conflict with anything in the screenplay, and in fact references are made a couple of times to Grant being a bit older, wiser, and more experienced than Ms. Newton.  He didn't do a whole lot of this light comedy sort of stuff, but I think he was brilliant with such material, there's a knowing bit of sly self-parody going on here which is wonderful.  Rogers is charming and believable enough as the shopgirl torn between a solid life and a fantasy - though I guess I think this is more Jean Arthur territory.  The real problems with the film are that the director, Lewis Milestone, just didn't have a talent for this sort of light, frothy romantic comedy - this was the guy who made ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT and OF MICE AND MEN, and he did very few comedies, though his next film was a somewhat similar reteaming with Colman.  There's little zip or excitement here and the film is in danger of getting bogged down at times with scenes that run just a bit too long for what they have to give us; one lovely exception is the beautiful romantic scene involving the older couple that momentarily ""adopt"" Grant and Newton when they are staying at a Niagara Falls hotel, taking them on a brief magical trip to a wishing well.

But despite these issues, it's well worth seeing if you're already into the screwball milieu or if like me you can't get enough Ronald Colman, whose films are all too seldom seen these days.  As usual for this genre, there are some interesting things being said about American hypocrisy towards sex and about the roles of men and women and one could also argue that the film is not so subtly digging at the Hays Code prudishness which makes it impossible to come out and make it's points about society without a lot of circling around and euphemistic language.  There are also some fine points made about how we treat artists and our prudishness in that era; given that the film is based on a story by the French master of the romantic and literate farce of this era, Sacha Guitry, that's not too surprising.  For some viewers not accustomed to such things, especially younger ones, this could be an irritation, but if you know the history of the screwball from this period, you'll probably be quite amused at scenes such as the one where a judge questions Grant over apparently salacious illustrations he had drawn for a book years before.

LUCKY PARTNERS was one of two films Colman made for RKO in 1940, the other being the similarly obscure MY LIFE WITH CAROLINE, also directed by Milestone, which, like this, isn't on DVD.  I'd love to have them both in nice restored prints on a single DVD, or heck, a whole Colman boxset collecting a couple of his unavailable 30s films as well, but it's not likely to happen.  This VHS is really pretty decent, and though as I said this probably isn't going to rank up there with Preston Sturges' and Howard Hawks' best stuff for most people, it's another good reminder of what some terrific acting and a literate script could make out of a fairly standard and lightweight comic storyline in the Golden Age.  Get it while you can.",1290211200,3,4613,4.787153652392947
327858,5,6301328450,"This  review was written on February 23,2008 at a very nice restaurant designed primarily to accomodate lovers.

A couple at a nearby table were periodically exchanging soft kisses. It was enchanting to watch them--and the movie Lucky Partners came to mind.

Lucky Partners is a 1940 film starring Ginger Rogers and Ronald Colman.
Both actors were at the height of their popularity with movie audiences.  The setting is Greenwich Village about 1940 and Ginger Rogers plays the character Jean Newton while Ronald Colman plays David Grant.

Jean is delivering a book from her aunt's shop and passes David.
As she passes him he says ""Good Luck"" with a captivating but innocent smile.  And when she decides to turn back and respond you know how the movie will end.

She returns to her Aunt Lucy played by Spring Byington carrying a $300 dress given to her as a gift minutes after David had wished her Good Luck.

At the book shop she notices David in his Bohemian quarters across the street.  Naturally they just happen to notice each other at the same time.

She waves the dress showing her best smile.  They meet at Nick and Nick's.  Immediately she lets David know that she is engaged. David who doen't believe in possesions and wealth does believe in one thing--honeymoons--and agrees to go halves provided he can do something special
for Jean with his winnings. He proposes in his toast to Jean a very
enchanting honeymoon--""To our honeymoon""

Jean retains her presence of mind and goes to get fiancee Freddie played
by Jack Carson. Freddie takes David outside for a fight. Large bodied but
small minded Freddie sees nothing wrong with the trip.  They would be
travelling as brother and sister.  In fact if it weren't for his Poughkeepsie trip he'd like to make the trip with them.

When David and Jean embark for Niagara in the car David has just given
her she is quite surprised and happy but deeply suspicious about David's
motives.  Freddie goes to Niagara when he learns Jean has gone there with
David.  He arrives just in time to make a complete fool of himself and ""leaves"" at Jean's request.

David proves himself completely trustworthy and Jean realizes that she has been suspicious all along.  She finds herself in a new place alone
with David.  Standing and looking into David's room after Freddie has
just left she says  ""Oh, what a lovely fireplace.  I love fireplaces in bedrooms.""

The ending long anticipated by everyone except Jean and David becomes certain only in the last minute of the movie.",1203897600,3,2513,4.7772621809744775

7811486,3,6301328450,"No film starring both Ronald Colman and Ginger Rogers is to be lightly dismissed, but 1940's LUCKY PARTNERS (RKO), in my opinion, is a misfire.  He is a professional dilettante in Greenwich Village (later on, one character calls him a ""loafer"" and Colman's character cannot disagree), but he is said to bring luck to those who associate with him.  She is a forthright girl with her hair in a severe brunette fall much more suitable to Barbara Stanwyck than Ginger Rogers, nervously engaged to a less than likeable type (Jack Carson), who buys a part ticket in a thinly-disguised Irish Sweepstakes.

Thus the triangle that complicates impending marriage -- the most common screwball-comedy formula --  is met.  Hollywood, of course, had just peaked in the production of Screwballers, including many of the great classics like THE AWFUL TRUTH, HOLIDAY, and BRINGING UP BABY (the last also for RKO).  However, as fellow reviewer Alex Udvary said in his review, this film starts out as screwball comedy and then gives way to a romantic comedy.  A lack of focus, a lack of ""snap"" and only middling chemistry between the two stars make this a desultory affair.  It's fun to see the stars, of course, but I couldn't help thinking of two other, later, screwball comedies at which they both excelled: the witty 1950 CHAMPAGNE FOR CAESAR with Ronald Colman and Celeste Holm, and the uninhibited 1952 MONKEY BUSINESS starring Ginger Rogers and Cary Grant (with a brief appearance by Marilyn Monroe), directed by Howard Hawks.
