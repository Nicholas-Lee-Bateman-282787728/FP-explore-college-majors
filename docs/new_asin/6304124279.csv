783670,3,6304124279,"""Barb Wire"" is not a good film. Honestly, it's a one or two star film at best, save that it does the unthinkable: It's a scene-for-scene remake of ""Casablanca,"" set in a post-apocalyptic future, with Pamela Anderson replacing Humphrey Bogart.
The sheer cheek involved in doing this -- I would love to have been in the pitch meeting for ""Barb Wire"" -- really makes this a hoot to watch and redeems its awfulness. Each scene from ""Casablanca"" that's cheerfully trashed is a laugh riot to watch, once you relax and stop worrying about Humphrey Bogart spinning in his grave.
Easily the most fun I've ever had watching a ""bad"" movie and good (extremely) mindless fun.",975456000,25,662,4.765217391304348
783671,3,6304124279,"Surprisingly, this isn't a bad movie.  It's not a classic, or anything original, but it does have Pam, and boy is she HOT!  How does she squeeze into that little tight black leather is anyone's guess.  Pam does a fine  job of acting, and come on , if she acts a little corny, think about what  the movie is about.",949017600,7,313,4.15
783672,4,6304124279,"I'm not a Pamela Anderson fan, and (as a woman) I'm not really interested in cleavage.  I was more-or-less forced to watch this at a friend's house.  But I have to admit ""That's Entertainment!!""  Bad dialog, ridiculous fight scenes, and every unbelievable reason for Pam to dress in tight, black leather.  Anyone who took this as a serious movie needs a CAT-scan.  The ultimate in camp!  Thoroughly enjoyable for the same reason that people slow down for accidents on the freeway or eat cheese out of a spray-can.  After seeing this, I have to believe that Ms. Anderson is far more intelligent than she lets on.  This could only have been done tongue-in-cheek as the trite scene of the shapely heroine limping away from the battlefield complaining, ""Dammit - I broke a nail"" could never have been included in a serious picture.  If you're going to watch this, do yourself a favor and get the director's cut ""with extra cleavage!""  Those who know me and have seen this movie will understand the inclusion of ""Don't call me Babe"" and ""Get in line"" in my vocabulary.",940809600,25,1063,4.697297297297298
783673,3,6304124279,"If it wasn't for her silicone-enhancements, Pamela ""Don't-call-me-a-babe"" Anderson probably wouldn't be in this movie... but consider where the story came from, a comic-book, and that  just about explains it all. Taken as just that, the movie is okay, and  features the requisite T&A, ""good cop turned bad cop turned good  cop"", loss of a loved one, etc. etc. The parody elements are  especially funny, especially since they consider the Canadian currency  valuable, and actually staged an Air Canada airplane!  Maybe American  viewers may not understand parody humour but hey, dammit, Pam's a Canadian!  All in all, not Oscar material, but not bad for those times when you just  want something to pass your time... like a comic book.",918950400,3,734,5.100840336134453

783995,4,6304124279,"i heard about this movie from some fellow tumblrites, and decided to rent the film. the film played well, but stopped and started during scenes a few times, though i kept in mind this might have been due to my internet connection.

im not gonna lie, i watched this movie solely due to the fact that Temuera Morrison was in this movie. some of you might know him best from his role as Jango Fett in Star Wars episode two, so of course, me being a fan, decided to find other films Morrison's starred in. i was surprised to learn he had a larger role in this film than i first thought (really, he plays Pam Anderson's love interest! and kicks so much butt in this!). he certainly had a larger role in this movie than he did in Star Wars, which i was happy to see.

yeah, the movie is the kinda cheesey action film you'd see during the nineties, that happened to have a busty blonde in fishnets and a pair of firearms blasting up some baddies, but it was a fun movie, and i for one would happily watch it again, and who knows, i might buy the DVD too",1469232000,,1046,4.147783251231527

784177,4,6304124279,"Regardless of your politics on good acting and what the skeptics refer to as the old ""t and a"" quotient, there is no denying the visual beauty that Pamela Anderson (in her heyday) brings to this magnificently silly screenplay; and, if you can get through the first ten minutes of this ""unrated"" version without rewinding twenty times to re-watch, then you deserve a medal for self-control! In actuality though, the film is probably not as erotic as all that--Pam's upper half is on display quite a bit, but there's nothing hardcore about this movie. In fact, if you watch past that open scene for very long, you will find a ridiculously campy and incomplete narrative--Ebert gave the film a passing mark (if I am remembering this correctly) but he co-wrote ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"", so what did he know? I'll tell you what he did know, and that was the look of a beautiful woman--and Pam certainly fits that bill. It's tragic to me that her career never really worked in a respectable sense; sure, she was no great actress, but she could have done better than movies that tended to ridicule her instead of giving her an opportunity to branch out (and I don't mean pornographic roles!). I have always adored her, despite her disreputable moments and the shameful press that seems to follow her around doggedly. The movie tries to keep up the action quite well, but I'm so distracted by Pam and that blonde hair that I can't critique too much else of any substantial interest.
The ""unrated"" DVD version is good enough with its picture and sound presentation and there are a few extras included, but essentially you must buy this if you like Pam, and her beauty overwhelms pretty much everything else here. B+",1422144000,,1714,4.6976744186046515

784279,1,6304124279,"The film that thankfully kept me from jumping the Pam Anderson strokebook fetish bandwagon. What a consistent character-a postapocalyptic burlesque dancer who shakes her surgically enhanced goods for every ogling patron, but ""Don't call her babe"", or she'll kick your butt. Spare me. Barb Wire's protagonists achieve a rare feat not often accomplished in cinema-they're unlikable and unrelatable. Like Barb's mouthy condescending douche blind brother, or the crooked cop with a heart of gold. A respectable crooked cop, yep those exist. People seem to say that us haters shouldn't take ourselves so seriously. None of us do, but this movie does that. And that's where the most foul perpetration occurs. Thanks to Youtube user Nostalgia Critic, he exposes that, if you took away the bad dialogue, boobs, fetish gear and bogus characters, the main story is essentially Casablanca. The brains behind this can't even be bothered to suck with originality, so they have to plagiarize a classic. In summary, this is bogus provocative dung dressed in the bad drag of a better film's clothes.",1408665600,,1083,5.2298850574712645
784280,2,6304124279,"Barb Wire, known by its working title, Casablanca 2-The Big Pair, is quite a cunumdrum.  When I first saw it in the theater with younger eyes, it was a stupid but fun romp.  Is anything made by Pam Anderson REALLY supposed to be taken seriously?  But with older eyes, I was actually floored by how nihilistic it is.  It is suprisingly brutal in its portrayal of violence, particularly against women.  Now I am not trying to make a feminist tract here, but it is very violent and not in a fun way like a movie like the Expendibles, where the cartoonish violence is delivered with a wink and a smile.  This is pretty much in your face, very much in tune with some of the action movies of the late 80s/early 90s era.  See The Last Boy Scout for another example.  It is basically a rip off of Casablanca except with more blood and boobs.  What could have been an entertaining, comic book romp is actually a kind of disturbing patiche of id.",1403049600,,936,4.364161849710983

784435,5,6304124279,"If you grow bored with the gratuitous nudity present in Pamela Anderson's work, then this is the film for you. Art film critics looking to sidestep entirely the aesthetic appeal of Anderson's body will not be disappointed--you will not be forced to sit through a single nude scene, not one. Don't be fooled by the fact that the film is set in a strip club; you will not have to suffer through any images of Anderson's nude form during the entire 98 minutes of this brilliant film. You may even think, at one point, that the filmmakers are about to force a full frontal scene upon you, given the occurrence of side-boob during a bath scene. However, fear not, brainy plot lovers--no nudity is to follow, despite what you might suspect.

The avant garde director has brought the focus back to the true reason moviegoers fell in love with Anderson to begin with--her stellar acting skills. ""Barb Wire"" is a profoundly prophetic dystopia which echoes with shades of ""1984"" and ""Brave New World"". Set in the distant future of 2017, the film accurately predicts the entire breakdown of American society. During the ""Second Civil War"", only one free city is left in the United States, in which the resistance is led by Anderson's title character.

Anderson's interpretation of the freedom fighter we can all only hope will appear within the next five years is sublime. The subtlety of her facial expressions, tone of voice, interaction with other characters, all make us glad that this film is 100 percent free of nudity.

After all, that is not what draws us to a Pamela Anderson film in the first place.",1345507200,4,1598,4.741007194244604

784671,5,6304124279,"The years between 1994 and 1996 were Bad Movie manna for fans of deliriously cheesy sci-fi thrillers set in the near future, what with JOHNNY MNEMONIC, STRANGE DAYS and John Carpenter's ESCAPE FROM L.A. But the ultimate booby prize goes to BARB WIRE. And what boobies! From the opening FLASHDANCE-esque strip club routine, in which millions of gallons of water are sprayed onto heroine Pamela Anderson's bared casabas, Barb Wire is a perky paean to the wonders of silicone. The unrated video version (which we'd call ""the director's cut"" if there were any signs there'd been a director), contains miles more footage of Lee's nipples looking as sharp and deadly as her stiletto heels. Speaking of which, when a rowdy heckler calls Lee a ""babe,"" she high-heels the ringsider to death, before snarling, ""If one more person calls me ""babe'!"" We can only surmise she'd prefer a more accurate nickname--say, ""boob""?

As you may have heard, BARB WIRE lifts its entire plot from CASABLANCA. In the Humphrey Bogart role, Anderson runs a bar friendly to both villains and freedom fighters in America's last ""free city,"" circa 2017. Since she's a neutral mercenary-for-hire, Anderson plays no favorites, and to prove it moonlights as a hooker/hit woman, explaining, ""You gotta use everything you've got."" Cinched into rib-crushing leather bustiers, Anderson is definitely doing just that. But, dependent as the ""Baywatch"" vet is on careful lighting, she is frequently sabotaged by the cameraman -- with hilarious results. There are moments when she appears to be a Karen Black lookalike trying to pass herself off as Jessica Rabbit.

When corrupt police chief Xander Berkeley turns up to collect blackmail money, cop a feel and down a cognac, Anderson demands payment for the booze (the feels are free). ""Add it to my tab,"" he sneers, finishing with the irresistable, inexplicable, presumably future-speak exclamation, ""Boom, boom, boom!"" Anderson puts up with some things, not with others. When a rude drunk snarls, ""Blow me!,"" for example, she calls on her attack dog, Camille, and the faithful pooch bites the boor in his crotch and drags him out of the bar. Boom, boom, boom! And when the Ingrid Bergman character shows up in the guise of one Temuera Morrison, Anderson doesn't just mutter, ""Of all the gin joints...,"" she decks him and screeches, ""Get out!"" Boom, boom, boom!

The clever dialogue doesn't stop here. Evil Colonel Steve Railsback roars at cop Berkeley, ""I will personally rip yer heart outta yer ass and stuff it back down yer throat!"" Boom, boom, boom! Casablanca fans will have dissolved so completely into helpless tears of laughter by the time Barb's kid brother (Jack Noseworthy) appears, they'll surely agree with this observation, ""This must be a post-traumatic stress flashback.""

Endearingly, Anderson maintains her haughty act of narcissistic self-assurance throughout this chaotic trash. To keep us awake, she does things like stroke her naked flesh in a transparent bubble bath. It all ends, as you'd hoped it would, with police chief Berkeley and out-of-the-closet Resistance fighter Lee alone on a rain-drenched airfield. When Berkeley confesses, ""I do believe I'm falling in love,"" the endlessly self-enchanted one snaps, ""Get in line!"" Barb Wire only begins to tap the Bad Movie Pneumatic Goddess potential of Anderson. This girl is a find. She is Pia Zadora come back. But where is the cinematic Svengali who can package her genius? Alas, Anderson is Mamie Van Doren without Albert Zugsmith, Jayne Mansfield without Tommy Noonan, Joe Dallesandro without Paul Morrissey. Paging Zalman King!",1185667200,,3615,5.174358974358975

784800,4,6304124279,"Pamela Anderson stars in this fast-paced and sexy movie about a gorgeous bounty hunter trying to survive during the second American Civil War.

Anderson stars as Barb Wire, a former freedom fighter for the United Front, a group of guerrillas who are fighting against the Congressional Directorate, located in Washington, D.C.  Barb has given up her freedom-fighter days, instead retreating to Steel Harbor, the last free city in America.  There, she has set up a bar/nightclub called Hammerhead, which caters to everyone, regardless of political affiliation.  On the side, she also moonlights as a high-priced bounty hunter, earning money to pay off local cop Alexander Willis (Xander Berkeley).  She also has frequent run-ins with a bail bondsman named Schmitz (Clint Howard).

Back in Washington, events have transpired which could upset Barb's tidy little business.  The Directorate began a virus program called Red Ribbon, with the help of scientist Dr. Corrina ""Cora D."" Devonshire (Victoria Rowell).  Derived from the HIV virus, this weapon can knock out any area in the United States in under 12 hours.  Cora D. ended up defecting to the United Front, changed her appearance through plastic surgery, and is now headed to Steel Harbor along with fellow fighter Axel Hood (Temuera Morrison).  Hood happens to be an old flame of Barb's.  They are in search of a special contact lens which can hide freedom fighters from identification scans.  Barb wants nothing to do with Cora D., Axel, or anyone who wants something for free.  However, she soon finds herself in the middle of a conflict between the United Front and the Congressional Directorate, who have sent the notorious Col. Pryzer (Steve Railsback) to Steel Harbor to find the lenses.  Pryzer begins investigating everyone in Steel Harbor, including Barb, her blind brother, and Alexander.  Will Barb succeed in delivering the lenses to Cora D. before Col. Pryzer finds them first?

This is a first-rate post-holocaust movie.  There is massive amounts of gunfire, huge explosions, and many scenes of Pam Anderson and her very revealing little black dress.  For a post-apocalyptic movie, Barb Wire is very good.  Be sure to watch the ""sexy outtakes""; you won't want to miss them!",1157673600,2,2240,5.1551246537396125

784803,4,6304124279,"Okay, this isn't an Oscar-level movie.  But once again the movie critics are taking themselves MUCH too seriously.  A long time ago I was taught that the three questions a reviewer has to ask are:

What was done?

Was it done well?

Was it worth doing?

Based on those criteria, this movie deserves a lot more respect than it gets.

What was done?  The filmmakers set out to do an outlandish remake of Casablanca.  But where Casablanca was intended as social commentary (not surprising since it came out in 1942) and although this movie does pay homage to that class of commentary, their main goal was to HAVE FUN!

Was it done well?  If they had set out to make a brilliantly acted Oscar-worthy film, then you could say it wasn't done well.  There are holes in the plot you could drive a truck through.  And no one can argue that the dialog or the script or the acting is Oscar-level material.  But this movie set out simply to have some fun and use Pamela Anderson to provide it.  She is not and will never be a brilliant actress.  But (as subsequent projects have proven) she is much more intelligent than most people give her credit for and she carries out the role of the ""shoot-em-up"" bounty hunter very well.  The special effects are also well-done, and the fact that people can fire 3000 bullets at her and she doesn't get hit is reminiscent of the old B-movie westerns with the good guys in the white hats and the bad guys in the black hats.  You want an example of how the movie KNOWS it is just fun?  Check out the first real shooting scene (in the hotel room), at the end of which you see a shot of her hand.  She says something like, ""Oh, shit"" because in the mayhem she broke a fingernail.

Don't expect this movie to be what it isn't and you won't be so hard on it.

Was it worth doing?  Sometimes we want to watch a movie just so we can escape for awhile from the drudgery and disappointments in our daily lives.  We don't want to think, we don't want to cry.  We just want a diversion.  And that's what we got.  The film never lets up, so you have no chance to be ""pulled back"" from it into your own problems.  YES!!!  A simple diversion done well is worth doing.

Oh, yes.  Pamela Anderson is gorgeous and she knows it.  But knowing it is not a crime.  She has fun with it and doesn't take it too seriously.  Neither should you.",1120089600,51,2346,4.26879271070615

This movie is so cool... the deleted footage is complete 100% smut trash, but the movie itself is very funny. Barb Wire is a secret agent who must steal the RETNAL LENSES and retreat from STEAL HARBOR to Canada. Anyways, I recomend this to all over the age of whenever they are mature enough to see Pamela Anderson fight crime in Steal Harbor. (?)",1119744000,2,605,4.17948717948718
784805,2,6304124279,"Wow. Now this is not good. However, the movie sets its level right away, by having a stripping, dancing wet Barb (Anderson) already in the introduction of the movie. So, there you have what this movie is all about. Sure you get some violence, explosions and bad costumes as a bonus. Clearly, there is no relevant story in the movie, all revolves around (Barb) to show her off in different ways. The mentioned costumes are almost offending to the audience. Whoever responsible for them clearly did not work very hard. Barb competes with herself to wear some leather-thing that shows off as much as possible, but actually must be considered well dressed as compared to other ladies. The villains wear something that bear a striking resemblance to nazi-uniforms. Well sure, we know who's the bad guys, thank you. And some other people wear broken calculators and other piece of machinery that you'll find in a scrap-heap as hats, and are automatically dressed up like guys from the future. If it was this easy to make a good movie, I could have made it myself. Fortunately it is not, and Barb Wire is not a good movie.
But, and this is a mysterious but, I actually didn't get bored out of my mind and switched off. The movie actually, in some way, had some small piece of entertainment value throughout that made me stay. And that something, whatever it was, is what ultimately saves the movie from being complete junk.
So, if you have absolutely nothing else to do, you may want to watch this one, once. You may get some ideas how to (or not to) dress for the next masquerade.",1090195200,3,1574,4.604982206405694
784806,4,6304124279,"The 1996 Pamela Anderson vehicle ""Barb Wire,"" her supposedly logical transition to superstardom on the silver screen, bombed at the box office. The vivacious blonde bounced back, of course, but the verbal jabs directed at this vanity picture must have hurt on some level. What I don't understand after I recently viewed this film is why so many people bashed it. Perhaps it concerned one of those overexposed celebrity issues, that people wanted to see her fail after seeing her so often in the tabloids and on television. I know I cannot stand the sycophantic blather about celebrities, so seeing one of the anointed crash and burn every now and then provides some comfort. But in the case of ""Barb Wire,"" I think a reassessment is at hand. This movie is far from objectionable when viewed within the context of its genre: ""Barb Wire"" essentially falls into the post-apocalyptic genre, a cinematic category in which most entries are extremely low budget potboilers that appeal to a male fan base. The emphasis in these types of movies is on special effects, quirky ideas, and beautiful women. ""Barb Wire"" meets all of these criteria quite nicely. It looks like director David Hogan had a hefty budget to play around with, and he certainly put the money in the right places as well: ""Barb Wire"" sports lots of big explosions and copious gunplay.
Pamela Anderson plays Barbara Kopetski, known as Barb Wire to her clientele at the Hammerhead Inn in Steel Harbor, who is a former soldier working as a bar owner when she isn't out bounty hunting. The year is 2017 and America is in the throes of a second civil war, with Steel Harbor the only ""free city"" left in the United States. The warring factions in this conflict, although never elaborated on as much as I would have liked, seems to be a fascist, right wing dictatorship called the Congressional Directorate and a more populist faction called the United Front. Barb once fought against the Congressionals until an event in the battle for Seattle soured her on the idea of morals and choosing sides. She now spends her days playing hardball at her bar, bantering with her headwaiter, and caring for her blind brother. Just keeping up with payments to the corrupt chief of police and his thugs keeps Barb endlessly busy, along with her frequent encounters with the sleazy bail bondsman Schmitz. Life in war torn America is tough.
Unbeknownst to Barb, problems back in the ruins of Washington, D.C. threaten to upset her lucrative business. The Congressional Directorate initiated a virus program called Red Ribbon with the help of a female scientist named Corrina Devonshire. This weapon, derived from the HIV virus, can wipe out the United Front areas in less than twelve hours. Unfortunately for the fascists, their doctor defected to the resistance, changed her appearance through plastic surgery, and is now headed to Steel Harbor with some type of special contact lenses that can hide resistance fighters from identification scans. Barb wants nothing to do with this rogue scientist, her resistance friends, or anyone else who wants something for nothing from her. Predictably, Barb soon finds herself in the middle of a conflict between Congressional thugs headed by the notorious thug Colonel Pryzer and the local resistance fighters who still maintain an ideological hold on her brother. The whole thing boils down to massive amounts of gunfire, big booming explosions, and lots of shots of Pam strutting around in skintight outfits. For a post-apocalyptic movie, ""Barb Wire"" works overall despite failing on a few critical levels.
""Barb Wire"" hinges on whether you accept the idea of Pamela Anderson as a ruthless bounty hunter capable of beating even the toughest guys into submission. This is a tough call. Sometimes Anderson pulls it off, but more often than not she doesn't and this hurts the film the most. Put a Sigourney Weaver in this role and it would have been a winner, but a rail thin woman with a big blonde coif and a waist you could wrap one hand around? Nope. Fortunately, we do see Udo Kier in a minor role, along with Steve Railsback as the unbalanced Pryzer and the ever-reliable Clint Howard as the smarmy Schmitz. Ultimately, the acting isn't nearly as bad as many entries in this film genre.
Another problem with ""Barb Wire"" concerns the plot. The people behind this film tried to do too much with it. There are so many subplots going on at once that it becomes slightly irritating trying to follow the various threads. Plot holes abound, for example Devonshire's claim that she developed Red Ribbon and wiped out Topeka, Kansas with it. If the virus worked and the Congressionals tested it, why not simply use the virus to destroy Steel Harbor and the rest of the United States? Why waste time tracking down this scientist if you could simply use the virus and solve the problem? Moreover, Barb constantly claims she wants nothing to do with anyone unless it is on her own terms. It is because Barb doesn't give anyone what they want that leads to the trouble in the first place. A smarter person would do a small favor just to keep problems away.
Despite a few difficulties, ""Barb Wire"" does exactly what this type of film should do: blow stuff up, show some pretty women, and sport a high body count. Fans of the genre who can look past its myriad flaws will find plenty to like with this movie. The DVD includes a trailer, cast bios, and expanded footage of the risqu introductory scenes (you will know which scenes when you see it).",1067817600,6,5519,4.816649104320337

7862075,5,6304124279,"Based on the Marvel Comics character, Pamela Anderson in 1996's Barb Wire, did justice to the dystopian heroine. Though it wasn't a great Box-Office seller, the movie found its legs in the underground cult scene. Pamela Anderson played the moody, take-no-crap protagonist masterfully. The movie has a good pace, plenty of action--with very few slow moments. The story is not all that original, but the presence of the bomb-shell, Pamela Anderson, makes it all worth while. My only complaint is they never made any sequels. I've owned Barb Wire previously on DVD. I had to purchase the Blu-Ray edition, to showcase on my Xbox One S. Package includes the Blu-Ray movie only.",1518825600,,672,5.008928571428571

7862077,5,6304124279,"the movie starts in a strip bar where (Pamela Anderson) BARB WIRE works at the time
the world has been taking over by the Resistance police , basically the germans
they do as they want and they don't ""NO"" for answer, either give or tell them what they want
or you will be killed literally , on the spot, so , its  stretch of the imagination everyone is scared of them!
but in this case,. Barb Wired"" is her own women and is not scared of anyone, including the resistance
she left the strip bar and with what money she made, she opened her own bar""HAMMERHEAD""
in her bar, no stripping, just music and party's , if someone does not like it, she will personally make sure they are dealt with
when the bar is low on money she goes out and kills or whatever it takes to make the money she needs later on the resistance
searches her bar, and tears it to shreds, she lost every thing. so  she finds out what they are looking for and without her knowing
its in her bar hidden under a table, her blind brother  knows about it, but never tells her and he loses his life
because of it, once barb finds out , there is hell to pay, anyway, she gets what is being looked for
and she make a deal with "" fatboy""  and they eventually meet and he does the wrong thing  and all hail breaks lose  barb wire included
you have to watch to see what really happens and how it turns out,lots of gunfights and some nudity at the first of the show
very well told story and believable stunts in the movie, you must watch!!",1516492800,,1494,4.13448275862069
