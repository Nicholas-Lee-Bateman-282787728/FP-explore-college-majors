A well put together spy movie, with good action scenes and a well developed plot and characters.

The lines feels a little weird at first till you realize that the lines are how people would actually talk, as compared to a Hollywood script that is designed to grab your attention regardless of how unreal the lines are.

My family has collected many of the Walmart Family Movie Night Collection titles, but this is our favorite! I highly recommend for anyone looking for clean, fun, wholesome entertainment for the whole family!",1345766400,3,578,4.818181818181818
4985671,5,B006G209RA,"We loved this movie!  No cussing, no inappropriate scenes or other naughties.  A family can actually watch this movie together and not be embarrassed.  The spy story was actually very well done!  Need a great movie for family night with excitement and no blood or gun shots?  This is the movie to watch!",1343001600,2,303,4.6415094339622645
4985672,1,B006G209RA,"Negatives First:
(1.) A made for TV movie with actors loaded with ""TV series"" in their resum credits. Consequently, physical appearance rules with lots of rote memorization and turn taking read-a-line and smile style acting.
(2.) Not only made for TV but funded by Wal Mart (mega stomper of small family business) and Procter & Gamble (you're only valuable if your'e whitely clean) with additional funding from Conagra (frozen fast foods) Pepsico (unhealthy junk food) Microsoft (bland conformity). In other words a very boring commercial script that families with an 11 year old will love. Problem there is that the story wouldn't be comprehensible to them.
(3.) Formula storyline of dad who has a secret life of chasing spies or whatever while family thinks he's a petroleum geologist. Stereotypic family of nerdy teen son (who else to figure out computer code); angry teen daughter for emotional coloring; gruff agency boss; Russian or whatever bad guys. We are told repeatedly that the kids take lots of AP classes. Are we promoting how smart they are or is it white middle class bragging.
(4.) Usual Hollywood script writers fake intelligence speak with lines like Clandestine Activities Division (CAD); Covert Intelligence Operative (CIO). CAD headquarters is shown as the usual lots of computer monitors with HUD reticles as the cool visual but looks so dated.
(5.) The only action scene occurs in the beginning with our dad-agent chasing someone performs two somersault rolls for no reason then jumps on the back of bad guy riding a motor bike all while talking to his wife on his cell phone. Another key scene (15 seconds is all this took) is when his teen son breaks a computer password by figuring out that if he adds two specific family birthdates together then divides by another certain family birthdate then that is the password. Unbelievable as well as dumb.
(6.) Predictable; family rescues dad and bad guys get caught. No one dies or gets hurt - too dirty. Mostly cheap location shots if you like a couple of rooms and a couple of streets with shops as backdrop.

Positive:
This conditioned consumer is heading off to Wal Mart to buy a P&G; a frozen dinner and a Pepsi.",1339459200,4,2187,4.894878706199461

8497313,3,B006G209RA,"My reaction to this movie is between ""it's ok"" (3 stars) and ""I like it"" (4 stars).

This movie is purposely geared to be ""family-friendly"" in that there are no swear words, no blood and gore, no sex, etc.

I don't think that is why I felt unsatiated by this movie.  These movies, especially almost all Disney movies, are to me like the difference between a fiberglass Eiffel Tower and the real thing.  I get a version of the concept, the idea, from both but not the same impact.

I think this movie will appeal to pre-teens and teenagers.  Maybe that is why I found this movie a bit predictable (though entertaining).

Christine Baranski as always gives a solid performance.",1375315200,,675,4.575
8497314,3,B006G209RA,"This is a Hallmark wanna be sponsored by Walmart and P&G.  It is a clean flick and I don't curse the time I spent watching it. It was a decent family time but it missed the mark on so many levels.  The idea and plot were fine, but it didn't hit any of the believable heart warming/ tear jerking passion and feelings that would ever make me want to watch it again unless I was super bored.  Nice attempt but missed the target.  Like eating vanilla ice cream with no toppings....",1373932800,,477,4.208791208791209
