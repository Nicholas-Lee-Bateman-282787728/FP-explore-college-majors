Beware there is a full frontal nude scene...doesn't last too long.  Even though there are a couple of important clues in this scene we could have done without the x rated bits.
Lots of good acting,  very lively with some nice bits of humor.  It's not expensive second hand.  I say go ahead and buy it.  You'll like it.",1186444800,,480,4.325842696629214
