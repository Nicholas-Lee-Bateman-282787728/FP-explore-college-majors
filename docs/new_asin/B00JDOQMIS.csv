6355284,5,B00JDOQMIS,"LIKE I REMEMBER IT ALL THOSE YEARS AGO. HARDLY WATCH MUCH OF THE NEW STUFF. NO PLOT OR REAL STORY LINE. IF YOUR NOT HUNG UP ON SEX, A GOOD DEAL",1414713600,8,143,3.6451612903225805
6355285,2,B00JDOQMIS,"In Pretty Peaches 2, an innocent girl Peaches (Siobhan Hunter) who's twenty years old and has been sheltered her entire life by her overprotective mother Eunice (Tracey Adams) decides to leave the nest and go on a trip to visit her uncle Howard (Ron Jeremy) in San Francisco. Along the way, she wants to learn more about sex education. The film was both thin on plot and hot sex scenes. The final scene between Peaches and her boyfriend Bobby (Peter North) was mechanical, as the two were veteran adult film stars going through the motions of the scene. Another problem is the plot as it was all a bad dream Peaches was having.

In Pretty Peaches 3, Peaches (Keisha) decides to leave home and her overprotective mother (once again played by Tracey Adams) and embark on a journey of spiritual enlightenment. Peaches was having a bad sex dream and her concerned mother has her see a therapist who advises Peaches to go on a quest of spiritual enlightenment. Similar to Pretty Peaches 2, there aren't a lot of memorable sex scenes in Peaches 3. The sex scenes felt scripted rather than spontaneous. The one highlight of this film was between Tracey Adams and Bobby (Gene Carrera) where Adams entices him with her aerobic leg lifts in the motel room. Aside from that, nothing about this film excited me. The final scene between Peaches and Spiritual Guru (Mike Horner) had a robotic, `bang, bang' style to it.

While the Pretty Peaches franchise featured recurring themes of the nave girl who leaves her overprotective mother and go off into adulthood to face all the challenges of the real world with all of its ups and downs, neither films should be considered classics in the genre of adult films.",1413244800,7,1696,4.726351351351352

6355289,4,B00JDOQMIS,"I'm a fan of the director's movies and these are definitely two of his best, from the last part of his career.
Pretty Peaches 2 involves Peaches meeting her crazy ""uncle,"" who's played by Ron Jeremy in one of the funniest roles I've seen him in. In this one, Peaches is played by Siobhan Hunter and she makes the character seem more intelligent than in the previous film and part 3. She's not a brilliant actress but she's well cast.
Ironically, her scenes are less interesting than the ones with Tracey Adams, who really steals the show as Peaches' mother, but everyone in the cast does a good job in their roles. Very entertaining.
Pretty Peaches 3 has Tracey playing Peaches' mother once again, but this time Peaches is played by Keisha. A lot of people think that part 2 is better than part 3, but I disagree. I think that part 3, while not as focused in terms of the story, is actually funnier than part 2 and reminded me more of why I love adult movies from this era, because I can watch them from beginning to end and enjoy the acting and craziness of the story along with all of the really hot and well shot action. This time Peaches is looking for spiritual enlightenment. She meets all sorts of strange characters.
The video quality on both of these movies is excellent. Part 2 looks better than part 3 and is in widescreen because it was released to theatres. Part 3 is full frame but still looks much better than my old VHS tape.
I'm not sure what the other reviewer was talking about with the white flashing. They take up maybe 1/10 of the frame, not 1/4, and to me they just look like splices in the print that was used to make this DVD. From what I can tell, there's no way to get rid of splices because that's how they edited the movie. Anyway, they were not annoying to me and I don't think they could have made this movie look any better than it does. I'm very happy that I bought this disc.",1402531200,38,1909,4.305555555555555
6355290,3,B00JDOQMIS,"In case you're unaware, both movies are 1980s hardcore porn. Pretty Peaches 2 is easily the superior movie of the two here, and is presented in enhanced 16:9 widescreen. The quality is great. What's not cool about this disc is Pretty Peaches 3's video quality (presented in 4:3 full screen). There is a white flicker that takes up about 1/4 of the screen almost every time the movie changes angles or scenes. It's annoying. This is prevalent right up until the end of the movie. How Vinegar Syndrome would release a DVD in this state is beyond me. I'm hanging onto my copy solely for Pretty Peaches 2. 3 is worthless to me like this, and I won't be watching it again.",1400544000,19,667,4.475409836065574

6355300,3,B00JDOQMIS,"Avoid the Drive-In Collections are all pretty poor in just about every respect ...Check out the Peekarama series which are as a whole of much better quality and better then most hard core flicks at a very good price for double sex features. Which show all, but not kinky as a whole, fair reproduction. Not a tease as many, but non-stop action,and often the actors are really enjoying themselves ...can be rough and crude yet still sensitive at times

Better then most current x rated type films which seems more artificial and twisted",1418774400,,534,4.741935483870968
