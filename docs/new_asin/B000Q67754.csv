2832565,4,B000Q67754,"Of all of the Disney Channel ""kidcoms,"" our family is especially fond of Cory in the House. There's something about the premise and the cast that just works well. Also, the young characters are among the kindest and most appealing of the current crop of shows.

This new DVD release, ""The Newt & Improved Edition,"" collects three episodes the showcase the earnest but ditzy Newy (Jason Dolley) plus an episode that premieres on the disc called ""Peace Love and Misunderstanding."" A short bonus feature also follows the cast through the production of the episode.

Kyle Massey, whose Cory character was spun off from the series, ""That's So Raven,"" deftly handles comedy timing like a vaudeville pro and is well supported by a fine cast that includes the very underrated John D'Aquino as THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. He played the most interesting character on the ""SeaQuest"" series and also played ""The guy who never saw Star Wars"" on Seinfeld.",1213056000,2,949,4.925
2832566,3,B000Q67754,"This Disney Channel original TV show (a spin-off from ""That's So Raven"") is about Cory Baxter (Kyle Massey), the son of White House Chef (Rondell Sheridan). Cory's best buddy is Newt Livingston (Jason Dolley), the Chief Justice's son, and Meena Paroom (Maiara Walsh), the daughter to the Bahavian Ambassador. The 3 teen leads in the cast have great chemistry and work well; my one gripe is that Maiara Walsh just can't seem to get a grasp on her accent; it comes and goes during dialogue, but is most definitely gone whenever she is singing. Can Disney hire a dialect coach for this girl? Minor point, as they all seem to be having lots of fun in this family show that is safe for all to watch together. The episodes on this disc are: ""The Presidential Seal,"" ""Through the Roof,"" ""Lip Service,"" ""Peace Love and Misunderstanding"" which was unaired. ""Peace Love"" is probably one of the best ones, as it gives a good lesson in being tolerant of other's beliefs and not making snap judgments based on stereotypes. Saruza Zamuti (Natalie Amenula) is a new love interest of Cory's who turns out to be from a country at odds with Meena's country. Cory finds himself stuck in the middle of the two girls. Kudos to Natalie for doing much better with her accent!

The extra featurette, ""Breakin' Down Cory In The House"" is really very good (about 12 minutes); it is a behind-the-scenes look at what goes into making ""Cory in the House,"" including writing the script, doing the sets, wardrobe, camera angles, editing, stunts, what the cast does when they ""hang out,"" and a taste of what being in the audience during filming is like. Very informative for youngsters not familiar with what goes into putting a sitcom together (hey kids, know what a ""table read"" is? you will after watching this!). DVD previews of other upcoming Disney movies are also included.

So for children/young teens, you will find this set to be enjoyable.",1211760000,3,1918,4.7395209580838324
2832567,2,B000Q67754,"A laugh track with a television show underneath, this spinoff of ""That's So Raven"" explodes with hoots, howls and hollers about once every eight seconds. But, realistically, it's never really very funny.

As for the four episodes on this DVD, ""Never The Dwayne Shall Meet"" stars Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, and Raven-Symon reprises her role as Cory's sister in ""That's So In The House."" The other two are ""Air Force One Too Many,"" in which Cory accidentally gives the state of Alaska back to the Russians, and ""Just Desserts,"" in which chaos reigns after Cory and his friends attempt to make pastries for a presidential banquet.

The disc has two short bonus features. The four-minute ""Raven in the House"" takes you backstage during the filming of the ""That's So in the House"" with Raven-Symon. The two-minute ""Rock in the House"" features... no, not The Rock, but the show's main child stars Kyle Massey, Maiara Walsh and Madison Pettis, who gush about how much fun it was to act with the former wrestler.

As you can probably tell, this DVD just leaves me cold. But still, I guess that for those times when your kids have to watch television, it's better that they be occupied by this harmless, happy yuckfest than whatever they'll run across on cable.",1187740800,4,1252,4.787037037037037
2832569,5,B000Q67754,"I've heard the rumors. This is the best anime of all time. Being familiar with Shrek, America's Next Top Model, That's So Raven, and Rock and Stick, I doubted that was true. However for the low, low price of 1 cent, I figured I could see if those rumors were true. It arrived 4 days later, and I'd practically forgot about it, but I brought it in to my house, grabbed a taco, and stuck the disc in my PS4. Shortly after it started, I was still having doubts, but from the second it started up with it's beautiful theme song, something clicked. My life was changed, and I finally saw the light. I wrote Cory x Raven fanfiction for days, and told of great sexcapades of Cory's dad and George W. Bush. They became beloved classics all over the internet, and I thank it all to this DVD. It was life changing. My only complaint was a layer of a mysterious white and sticky substance on the back of the disc, as well as on the box, but after rubbing it lightly with a moist tongue, it was like new.",1445040000,16,992,4.198952879581152

Raven Symone guest stars in one of the episodes, while Dwayne Johnson,  ""The Rock"" guest stars in another. Beware these episodes makes you want the entire series which is pretty much impossible to get at all. LOVE this series and wish I could get whole thing but sadly can't seem to find it.

Well before the mainstream picked up on this masterpiece, I became invested in its original characters and rich story.  Don't know if the youngsters today just watch it because ""everyone else is"" or if they're just as captivated as I was.
I loved it so much that I currently have a Kyle Massey fat head, the limited edition steel book special edition, Mr. Baxter's autobiography, and the collector's Blu-Ray box set.

I looked at forums, YT videos from experts in the field, and asked friends all around. And I couldn't really find an anime series that I really liked. Then, as my Amazon Prime membership was about to expire and I really wanted to make one final purchase, I found this small underrated masterpiece. I can now see why Corey in The House has set such a precedence for anime that came after. The English dub is so good it seems like it's synced up to the characters exactly! I honestly can't believe that such a masterpiece was only $5. With 4 whole episodes of the raddest character animation has ever seen, it's more than worth buying. I'm probably going to buy another copy just so I can sell it when i'm old for hundreds of dollars, as animes like this come once in a lifetime.",1462838400,5,871,4.317073170731708
