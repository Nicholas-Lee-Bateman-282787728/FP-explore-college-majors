Hero Rex Lease and co-pilot Clyde Cook (former silent comedian) force land their bi-plane below the border sometime during the Mexican Revolution and are captured by liberating bandidos. There's some humor poked at the ""liberators"" as they ""viva"" this and that, when all they want to do is rob and steal. Rex and Clyde are forced into the gang and made to take part in robbing the local pueblo. Later the good citizens identify our pals as bandits and they have to dig their own graves before facing the firing squad. They also manage to find time to save a pretty young senorita from a forced marriage to the jefe of the bandidos.

I liked this early (1930) B-Western talkie for several reasons.

1) I don't expect much from early sound B-Westerns, so I was pleasantly surprised at how well this film came off. For being shot outdoors and on location the sound recorded very smoothly and did not appear awkward.
2) The opening scenes are of the U.S. Army border patrol at camp. We get to hear them sing ""You're In The Army Now"". You don't often see WW1 era soldiers on the Mexican border in B-Westerns. This was interesting.
3) Lots of extras in this film. Street scenes, cantina, chase sequences all have lots of extras. Maybe they actually filmed in Mexico where extras were readily affordable. The location shooting looks good wherever they were.
4) The dialogue has some wit and charm to it. I found it more natural than some early B-Westerns of the same period which usually have a stilted delivery designed solely to move the plot along.
5) The two pals are likable and the senorita a real cutie, even though she can't climb out a window.
6) ...and lastly, Clyde Cook. Never heard of him, never seen him before. He's supposed to be a former silent comedy star. I liked him and his ""...hello, hello, hello"" bit. A loser sidekick to be sure, but not a complete idiot or just downright annoying. He has a nice sense of timing, like a good silent comic. And he has a running routine throughout the film in which he attempts to change out of an oversized pair of baggy pants into a comfortable fit, but gets caught every time he drops his drawers, leaving him in an uncomfortable situation, as he then scurries off holding up the baggies. It reminded me of a Buster Keaton type routine and is done with excellent comic timing. I'd like to see some of this guy's silent comedies.

So, if you don't expect too much, you'll come away from this all the better for the experience. It's a rare 1930 B-Western/Aviator/Mexican Revolution film with good sound, some interesting dialogue and nice location choices.
And it looks good too. The image is quite clear for such an early film, though not restored. I was very happy with this purchase from ALPHA. Nice cover too.",1327363200,,2816,4.605577689243028
