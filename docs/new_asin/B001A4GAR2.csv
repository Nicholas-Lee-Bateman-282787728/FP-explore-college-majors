Bill Nye is your typical Bill Nye; repeat cuts, fast edits, weird noises.  Hey, it keeps the kids' attention.  The only item that's dated is a reference to bike ""accidents"".  These days, we're taught to call them ""crashes"".  Kids, however, won't notice and won't care about that.  The focus of his short is wearing a bike helmet and being aware of traffic -- good, general knowledge.

The second short, with Pinnochio coming to life, is a little cringe-inducing in its goofiness -- definitely for the younger set.  What's freaky is that it's a young Elijah Wood (""Frodo"" from Lord of the Rings movie trilogy) playing Pinnochio.  I was too embarassed for him to watch, but my kindergartener and 3d grader had no problem with the program.  Since I didn't really watch, I can't tell you too much of what it was about, but I heard them talking about having the correct equipment when roller skating (yes, it's that old), biking, etc.

I haven't seen all the safety videos out there (yet), but Bill Nye is a big plus for me.  He's famous, and his show is still shown in our local schools, so kids will listen to him.  Much better than Ms. No-name reading from cue cards about the importance of helmets...",1251676800,,1308,4.6593886462882095
