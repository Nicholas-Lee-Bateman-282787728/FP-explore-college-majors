7481429,5,B016Z623AW,"Once again L.A. Marzulli is on the cusp of current world events and how they line up with the ancient texts (namely the Bible). His latest addition to the Watchers series is value for money to say the least, at nearly 2 hrs in length he covers a plethora of events unfolding before our eyes which could lead to the 'falling away' predicted in these last days. If you want an objective view of how the chaotic world is unfolding and an understanding of key events, then the watchers series is for you, whether you believe in a God or not, grab the DVD and check things out for yourself.

Once again L.A. has been courageous in discussing matters which the church today has cowardly ignored or failed to address and he deserves all the accolades he gets for the quality of his products and extensive research he puts into them. I own all the watchers series and will continue to purchase every single one between now and when the Lord Jesus returns! Great job L.A.!",1446163200,9,963,4.471590909090909

7481431,5,B016Z623AW,"Great movie which documents hard to find artifacts.  La visits some private collections and private land which has amazing artifacts which prove there was a race of beings on this earth as described in the book of Enoch.  These beings have a much larger cranial cavity which would allow for a much larger brain than humans.  However several powerful organizations have tried very hard to hide this portion of our planets history.  How they have got away with it this long, is beyond my comprehension, but I know why they have.  If the general populous knew about these beings, then it would be common knowledge that we are not the most intelligent beings to be on this earth.

Giants were in land in those days, and their bones still remain.  Now watch for yourself as La and his band of merry men, measure the cranial cavity of these beings to discover what the bible, and other synchronized extrabiblical texts describe as the Watchers, a group of angels which created the Nephilim, by having relationships with earthen women, whose spirits were not created in heaven, and according the bible shall wander the earth until the great judgement.  The origin of demons, all began with the Watchers, whose offspring were the reason for the Great Flood.  These Watchers were cast into prison in chains beneath the earth for 70 generations, which seems to have ended around the time of the Industrial Revolution.  These Watchers taught men many things, did they start the Industrial Revolution?  Seems kinda odd that it was horse, buggy, and beasts of burden for thousands of years, to planes, trains, and automobiles within such as short time.

Grab a copy of Watchers 9 to supplement your studies into the secrets of this world, which were once hidden by men, only now to be revealed to those who seek God's knowledge.",1463184000,5,1815,4.80064308681672

7481438,5,B016Z623AW,"This is the first time I have seen them produce a video that is inspiring and informative at the same time.  Their prior videos are very informative and factual but this one has a different twist and is encouraging too.  They toned down the background music which helps.  The bring forward some information from past videos and up date them as well.  I liked the rabbi in here, he has interesting knowledge on the Torah and explains how they break down their books, which I didn't know. This video is a great update.",1452816000,7,516,4.516129032258065
