8677466,5,B00NCZ96FU,"I don't know why this version of ""Swan Lake"" has so few revues. It may be because Amazon categorizes  this BD disc as B2 and therefore  will not play in the US. This BD is "" ALL REGIONS "". Well now to the point:
I love this version because it is utterly fantastic,of course it doesn't follow the traditional story but the liberties taken do not detract from the fact that it is beautiful.
All the dancers are very very good andBernice Coppieters is gorgeous as ""her majesty the night "".
The ballet is modern yet classical and I don't think you will regret buying it.",1428796800,3,566,4.330188679245283
8677467,5,B00NCZ96FU,"This reconfiguration, both musically and dramaturgically, of Swan Lake is well worth your while. There are caveats, mainly with the camerawork. Too many times when we need to see the feet, we are given medium close-ups of head and torso. This is dance, all the while. Traditionally mimed roles are danced throughout, and brother, are they ever danced, indeed. And too often during multiple activities, we are shown but one. Full stage shot, please. We should, for one example, not be forced to miss a single second of Jeroen Verbruggen's performance (as The Prince's Confidant, or Benno, as we've known him). Truly, there isn't a faulty link. The Siegfried, Stephan Bourgond, simply could not be better, as far as I'm concerned, and his Odette, Anya Behrend, is ravishing (Odille is taken by another fine dancer, April Ball). Rothbart is a female, not so much Queen of the Night as Night, itself as a merciless universe, suberbly embodied by Bernice Coppieters. Despite the frustrating videography, the dance is of such superb quality as to inspire perpetual forgiveness and damned well rhapsodic viewing. Highest marks, once again, not to mention gratitude, for choreographer Jean-Christophe Maillot and Les Ballets de Monte Carlo.  hfs",1428364800,2,1237,5.185
8677468,5,B00NCZ96FU,"The title says ""After Swan Lake"", but that is an error:  This ballet is certainly not ""after"" in the narrative-time sense, relative to the ""Swan Lake"" we all know, nor is it ""in the style of "" that (Petipa/Ivanov) ballet.  What it is is Maillot's typical reworking of a classic.  Here's what we get:  A black-and-white interpolation at the beginning, looking like a dreamy and grainy old movie, that foretells the coming story (and mindful of the puppet scene in Maillot's ""Romeo et Juliette""); Rothbart transmogrifying into two dark angels/henchmen and Bernice Coppieters as Her Majesty the Night (a thinly-veiled Queen of the Night from ""Die Zauberfloete""); the black swan making her appearance early and often so that we easily pick up the story line of her being, as Night's daughter, Night's pick for the Prince's hand; the king (Alvaro Prieto) getting adulterously interested in Night early on; and, while we are at it, it seems that the prince here (Stephan Bourgond) may have a good dollop of old-fashioned oedipal lust going for his mom the queen--well, that's all in a day's work for Jean-Christophe Maillot of course, and, truth be told, Mimoza Koike [the queen] is undeniably hot; the prince having a ""confidant"" (Jeroen Verbruggen, dancing splendidly) who, as a character, is obviously ripped whole from Shakespeare (Mercutio); Maillot's usual sexing things up.  (Way back when, I read a piece by Clive Barnes in which he said that ballet is ""all about sex"".  I guess that Barnes and Maillot have been reading from the same playbook.)  We also get the usual creative and always-interesting Maillot choreography, with a little Mats Ek thrown in here and there, putting whole new takes on the familiar Tchaikovsky music.  And, typically with Maillot, we get no ""ars gratia artis"" dancing--all the choreography either advances the story or fleshes out the characterizations and/or emotions involved.  An iconic image from this ballet shows the male corps dancers in a ""line"" across the stage front.  As this image is gorgeous, splendid and captivating, and not at all like any of the lines of corps de ballet swans in the standard choreography, it vividly captures in microcosm the ""feel"" of this production.  Also, we get an ending which is neither the Petipa/Ivanov tragic ending nor the Nureyev tragic ending and yet is certainly as equally powerful as, or even more powerful than, either of those (and I won't spoil it for you by revealing it). On top of all that we get gorgeous dancers creatively and colorfully costumed.

I love it.  As to the dancers, I'll single out Anja Behrend as the white swan, she with her soft, feminine, sensitive face and radiant, vulnerable portrayal (and she bourrees a LOT in this choreography and always does so beautifully and expressively); Verbruggen; Mimoza Koike as the queen, elegant and astonishing (and here is that rarity: an Asian dancer who is tall and leggy, and--did I mention?--she is hot); Gaelle Riou as the Indifferent Pretender (embodying it); Maude Sabourin as The Insatiable Woman (very sexy and riveting).  Bourgond is fine as the Prince, though he doesn't come across, to me at least, as especially ""princely""--more like a frat guy who gets awe-struck of the white swan.  (I'll interrupt my review here to comment that, in my opinion at least, Les Ballets de Monte-Carlo stands above all other ballet companies in terms of expressing character in the dancing, even in the smallest roles.  Maillot has no equal here as far as I know.)

Many memorable moments and images arising from this ballet.  However, as in ""Romeo et Juliette"", I wish that the male lead were costumed more noticeably, but it's at least better here than in ""Romeo"".  Generally fine cinematography, though some (and I might well be one) would object to the overhead Busby Berkeley shots early on.  Excellent lighting.  Hi-def.  The booklet lists the entire cast and their roles (bravo!), making amends, it seems to me, for an egregious mistake in the booklet for ""Le Songe"".

Get this.  I'm betting you'll be most glad you did.  Call it ""Swan Lake for grown-ups"", or ""Swan Lake with depth and sass"".",1419552000,8,4138,4.9623188405797105

8677470,5,B00NCZ96FU,"The title of this ballet is ""LAC, After Swan Lake"". What does that mean? ""LAC"" is easy, it is short for ""Le Lac des Cygnes"" which is French for ""Swan Lake"". In French, they just call the ballet ""Lac"" in the same way Don Quixote is called DonQ for short. But what does the subtitle mean, ""After Swan Lake""? Funny, it is the English and not the French part that is the tricky aspect here. What does the cover look like in France? No clue there, they use the same cover(I checked). When I first saw this title I assumed it referred to the story that comes after Swan Lake leaves off. That is not the meaning of ""after"" in this case. ""After"" here means ""in the style of"". This is important in understanding this work. It is not the usual Swan Lake story, but a different approach. There are some familiar benchmarks that we can cling to such as the Queen(but also a King!) and the Prince and his faithful friend(often called ""Benno"" in some versions). There is no Rothbard but instead ""Her Majesty the Night"". There are also a White Swan and a Black Swan. As far as the story goes, it is very difficult to make any specific sense out of it, but that is not unusual in ballet. We can only rely on our general knowledge of the story and extrapolate from that.
Aside from the confusion of the story, the dancing is excellent. The style is almost entirely classical ballet(for example, all the women dance on pointe) with hyper-modern elements thrown in but the classical and the modern are separate and distinct, one of Maillots's elements of style. Mime is not separate but done while executing choreography. The general feel is of one uninterrupted  continuous choreography with one scene flowing smoothly into the other. Small solo moments do exist but mostly it all flows together. But within the flow we can see separate scenes play out. It is not easy to describe choreography in words. You might say it is Wagner's opera style applied to ballet. But one thing is clear: the dancing is very impressive!
The music is evidently pre-recorded since it is the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra conducted by Leonard Slatkin. This may have been produced originally for TV. The general look of the ballet is beautiful, with great lighting and staging.
While this is not recommended for a first look at Swan Lake, it is lots of fun for those well familiar with the work.",1415318400,11,2357,4.57210401891253
