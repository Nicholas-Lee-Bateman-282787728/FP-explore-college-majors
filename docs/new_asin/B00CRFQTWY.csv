5735507,3,B00CRFQTWY,"Hey, my name is Marcus and I'm 19 now. Anyways, I grew up watching the Winx Club back in 2004 when I was in elementary. I fell in love with the show, because it reminded me a little of one of my old fave TV series, Sailor Moon. I was devastated after buying all the Winx DVDs and hearing in 2007 that The Fox Box/4kids TV lost the rights. Then I was excited when Nick obtain the rights. Thus, I am disappointed that they cut out the majority of this movie. The movie is on youtube, and it is originally an 1 hr & 29 mins. & 59 secs. but they made it only 45 mins. -_-
Update- 5/28/16 I remember being highly upset at first but since then I've watched this version, so many times and actually believe Nick did a good job by trying to fit this movie into the Winx series story-line, because if you watch season 4 it makes no sense that Nabu was in this movie after he died.",1369180800,9,871,4.011494252873563

5735530,2,B00CRFQTWY,My 3 yr old watches minimal tv and she saw this and picked it to watch on the kindle. It looked harmless to me. The vocabulary of the characters is wretched and there is a lot of kissing and romance for a little kids cartoon. I didn't like it all.

5735552,1,B00CRFQTWY,"If you love the Winx Club then don't waste your money on this Nickelodeon version of the Magical Adventure. The original version ran for about 90 minutes but this version has been cut to fit a 60 minute time slot by some heavy-handed editing. It is now only 45 minutes long so that in itself should indicate how badly butchered this movie has been. Sheesh! Nickelodeon didn't even bother to remove the grey spots for commercial breaks before transferring it to DVD. If you must have it, then there is an unedited Italian release (Region 2, PAL) available directly from Rainbow that includes an English soundtrack. It is expensive but worth it.",1389052800,3,643,4.75

5735559,5,B00CRFQTWY,My daughter loves Winx Club. This movie was just another successful view like the books and cartoon shows. It does not disappoint.,1378857600,7,130,4.954545454545454
5735560,3,B00CRFQTWY,"As a fan of magical girls - or in this case, guardian fairy princesses -I was overjoyed to see that both of the Winx Club movies received US English releases. I loved what Nickelodeon did with the first film, and after seeing the second in the European-English dub and loving it, I hoped the good feelings would continue.

But then I saw the 45 minute running time on the first disc and all the good feelings were gone.

The movie isn't bad though - I honestly think that the major change to the plot still worked somehow, probably for the better. The original movie's plot actually has Sky [*not really a spoiler*] propose marriage to Bloom, not invite her to a Princess Ball [which would probably be something Bloom would prefer doing to Sky, given her personality], so it's a sudden huge step for our main couple right at the get-go of the movie; it's understandable that Nick probably changed this to relieve parents of the idea of their child's beloved show about love, friendship, fairies and magic having young teen love just instantly leading to marital happiness and bliss, and a Princess Ball is more of something that the general age range for Winx Club would probably love anyway [it works for the other Princesses in the fictional media anyway. Plus, it's 'Princesses'. I think it sells itself.].

Other than that, the plot is still ""bad witches trying to rid the good magic from the world, good fairies fight to save the magic, yadda-yadda-yadda"" - we all know the drill. There are inconsistencies in the film [since this supposedly takes place after Season 4; this is true in both versions], but the original RAI English music remains [which is a miracle in itself] and the CGI animation is really quite pretty.

Still, the sudden edits to make a supposed 87 minute movie into half its time have a good plot is what makes this release fail. A lot of unnecessary scenes that I found amusing in the original film were cut, and added with the plot changes, this film is like Nickelodeon's good attempt at being like the show's original US licensee, 4Kids Entertainment [who was infamous for their many edits and cuts to anime and foreign cartoon series]. Just that last sentence is a sad thought to even think about, but they did it.

I really wish the full movie was dubbed into Nickelodeon-English, as I honestly prefer their voices than the European cast [and even the 4Kids cast, though they never made it this far]. Oh well, at least there are seven episodes of the show - Season 5! - on the second disc to whet your Winx appetite. If anything, you should buy the DVD solely for the episodes and maybe watch the movie once before using it as a cup-coaster. If you have a Winx Club fan or a fairy/princess-obsessed child in your house, the movie should tide them over after a couple of hours... until they find the original European-English version on Youtube to be much better than the Nick cut.",1376697600,6,2912,4.624758220502901
5735561,3,B00CRFQTWY,I was bummed this was a shortened version of the Italian version. It left out some good scenes especially between Bloom and Sky.,1376611200,3,128,4.608695652173913
5735562,1,B00CRFQTWY,"My daughter is a fan of winx club and even she hates it. I saw the the original movie with my daughter and it was better. I don't even like winx club that much but I can tell you this version is a waste of your money. Don't watch the movie, only watch the bonus disc if you do buy it. My daughter was looking forward to seeing more action like in the original but nothing like that happened. Hope this review helps.",1376265600,,415,4.0120481927710845
5735563,5,B00CRFQTWY,"Winx Club: Magical Adventure is a quirky and happy animated series about a group of powerful women who must harness their friendship to save their world.  They must battle with a few witches who want to tamper with the balance of positive energy in the universe.  The character of Bloom harnesses the help of her friends to help protect the culture of harmony in the land of Alfea. ""Winx Club: Magical Adventure"" is an enjoyable film for those who like watching animated movies.",1376265600,6,478,4.746987951807229
5735564,5,B00CRFQTWY,"The only reason why there are so many edits is because it fits nowhere in the winx timeline. I found more reasons online as to why it was edited. Hope you read it all.

In the Nickelodeon dub, Winx Club 3D: Magical Adventure is no longer considered as being part of the same continuity as the rest of the series.

There are some uncertainties about where in the timeline of the Winx Club 3D: Magical Adventure film fits in. This is due to various inconsistencies in the film with respect to the end of Season 4. These inconsistencies are caused by the fact that the script at the second film was written after the first film and before Season 4.

 The Winx had to stay at Bloom's parents place when they came to Earth while they already had their lounge at the Love & Pet where they were already staying by the beginning of Season 4 before they obtained their Believix.

 The Fairy Pets have not been seen at all, despite the fact that the Winx girls already had them before they received their Believix.

 Helia is seen with his original hairstyle from Seasons 2 and 3 while in Season 4 he changed his hairstyle shortly before the Winx earned their Believix, in the same episode.

 At the end of Season 4, Nabu was in a coma-like state after draining all his energy to save the Earth Fairies from the Wizards of Black Circle, and Morgana said that she would take care of him till he wakes up again, but Nabu appears in the movie in a healthy state without any explanation on how he recovered. And he disappears/is stated as died in 5th season.

 The Winx were using their Believix in the film while at the end of Season 4 they reverted back to their Enchantix.

 Roxy was introduced in Season 4 and by the end of the Season, she decided to become a student at Alfea. However, she is not seen at all in the film, even as an Alfea student.",1372204800,3,1838,4.320699708454811
5735565,5,B00CRFQTWY,The children watched this 4 times during the 24 hour rental. The next day they wanted to see it again!,1372204800,9,102,4.15
5735566,3,B00CRFQTWY,The version of the movie shown on Nickelodeon had over 11 minutes of the movie edited out. There was an opening bit about a goldfish that Bloom sets free that was not in the broadcast version. So check the number of minutes for this release to see if the DVD version is uncut.,1370390400,,276,4.226415094339623
5735567,5,B00CRFQTWY,This Winx Club movie is even better than the first.  I'm glad that Nick took over the rights from 4 KIDS so that the later seasons became availible.  This movie reveals the secret why Prince Sky's father always seem to have trouble with his relationship with Bloom in the TV series.  Its great to see how much Bloom has grown and become less dependent on her parents thought it nice in this movie seeing Bloom's Earth parents together with her birth parents.  The movie eals with Bloom's birth father being upset with Sky for not taking Bloom to the princess ball and his search for a better suitor for her. Bloom knows her heart lies with Sky and with the Winx help plans to get to the bottom of Sky's action when the Trix's newest attack causes The Winx to loose their powers and the girls join with The Specialists on a new quest.,1369440000,2,833,4.3896103896103895
