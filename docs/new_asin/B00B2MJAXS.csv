5553194,5,B00B2MJAXS,"I'll confess from the start that I am a student of Chogyam Trungpa's son and heir, Sakyong Mipham. Having confessed, I am deeply appreciative of this film's depiction of an astounding figure, a fearless teacher, and a genuine human being. The viewer is given the opportunity to experience what it must have been like to be around Trungpa, discovering groundlessness, wakefulness, delight, and terror by his very presence.  The filmmaker has elected not to include critical views outside his community of practitioners, but she does not hesitate to address the salacious aspects of sex and liquor that often overwhelm consideration of Trungpa's essential sanity and selflessness.

5553198,4,B00B2MJAXS,"This is an excellent film honest and heartfelt.  I appreciate the accounts of his students as well as other prominent Tibetan and Zen teachers. I was a student at Naropa during early 2000 and I am a current student of Sakyong Mipham (his son).  At first I had a hard time with some of the rumors and scandals surrounding Trungpa Rinpoche's life... and currentlyI realize that I was judging without the knowledge and full perspective of the situation. CTR was a pioneer in bringing Buddhism to the West, essentially the first Tibetan teacher  with a relatively solid command of the English language and understanding of western culture to teach Vajrayana Buddhism as well as the Shambhala teachings to westerners.  So much of the current groundwork of Buddhism in America today wouldn't exist without CTR.  I can see that there are a lot of comments with deep scathing remarks and I understand that there are some very uncomfortable elements and controversy about CTR with his alcoholism and sexual relations with students.  What I hear over and over from the people who were actually involved in these situations is that it was out in the open and not hidden and many of the students as you see in the film, not only consented, but learned a great deal from relating to CTR in that way.  I appreciate Pema Chodron's approach because it is hard to sit with.
One of the other comments I would like to add is that CTR was a recognized incarnation of the Trungpa Tulku lineage and he was trained rigorously in Surmang monastery.  He was acknowledged by many prominent teachers among Tibetan Buddhism as a very advanced and gifted practitioner with a gift for understanding the Dharma from an early age.  He was very close with 16th Karmapa and was also highly respected and close with Dilgo Khyenste Rinpoche arguably one of the most revered Tibetan Buddhist teachers of our time.  Yes, Trungpa Rinpoche had some very human struggles and quite a controversial approach to life and teaching the Dharma in the West. It is understandable that his behaviors would turn the stomach of many western students.  However, if you read The Profound Treasury of the Ocean of Dharma volumes it seems clear to me that CTR's presentation of the Dharma to west was vast and profound indeed.  An excellent and provocative film about the complex life of a pioneer in western Buddhadharma.",1421452800,6,2366,4.814814814814815

5553205,1,B00B2MJAXS,"What everyone leaves out is what I consider his greatest failing: the abandonment of his second son who was severely autistic. Rather than care for this boy, he was, instead, shunted aside to a Buddhist monastery in Sikkim for decades. If you wish to read a book and see a film about a truly good family with an autistic boy then watch and read The Horse Boy. The devotion of the Horse Boy's parents stands in sharp contrast to Chogyam and his wife's care of their son. If you watch the movie, then you will have a chance to see the Mongolian shaman, Ghoste, in action.

A second thing that is rarely mentioned is Chogyam's immense pride. When I met him and asked him how to pronounce his NAME, he told me it was Rimpoche and that it meant ""teacher"" or ""king"" Any Buddhist or any Christian will tell you that the biggest obstacle to God or enlightenment is pride. And he had a bucket load of it.

Chogyam was very psychic, intelligent and clever. But enlightened or even an authentic Buddhist he was not. You can fool all of the people some time, some of the people all the time but not all of the people all of the time. It's good to see from the reviews that there are still some people who's psycho/emotional needs are not so great that they can entirely gloss over reality in order to preserve a hagiography of their father figures.",1376611200,18,1336,4.383064516129032
5553206,5,B00B2MJAXS,"this movie gets five stars. it's well done and HONEST. it presents chogyam in a positive light, but still clearly details the fact that this guy is a perfect example of how someone can live in decadence, be addicted to intoxicants, have sex with his followers, and still maintain high/holy religious status.

if i was reviewing the guy he would get negative stars. but i'm reviewing the documentary which was really good!

this movie was truly amazing. the most amazing thing is that people followed this guy as if he could teach buddhism!

why would you ask a rich, womanizing alcoholic how you, as a regular person, can end your suffering? he cured his suffering with booze, riches, and ladies, anyone can do that! we need buddhism to teach us how to do it without those things!
he had no clue how to do it using buddhism. he just could regurgitate buddhist teachings because he memorized them. there is no such thing as this type of crazy wisdom. this guy was a cult leader and nothing more.

he even had a bizarre buddhist military thing where he would dress up in high status military garb and have people march around their compound. he taught british english elocution lessons to americans who were native english speakers even though he himself spoke with a thick tibetan accent. i have no clue why so many people interviewed spoke highly of his abilities with the english language. the film has to have captions when he speaks because his accent is so thick. he seemed to be all over the place like any rich eccentric, picking random activities and hobbies because money was no obstacle, nor was man power. he just did whatever he wanted and had his followers do likewise. he at one point seems to have become enamored with art and of course his students followed along.

for each one of these things the students interviewed are clearly torn on how to explain it. they seem to kind of know that it was just a rich old drunk guys fun and games and they were oblivious to that at the time since it was the 70's and everyone at his compound was ill educated on what they were doing to begin with, but they try to explain them in a buddhist sense anyway. the person trying to explain the military stuff is really funny. you can tell they have no clue as to what the deal was with that insanity!

my assessment is that this is the result of cult mentality and drug and alcohol abuse and the era. a bunch of hippies who knew nothing about buddhism found a cult compound where they could find some hippy spiritualism and get stoned and get laid. the leader slept with all the pretty girls and drank all day and gave talks on buddhism. seemed like a hip place i guess.

in reality, in traditional buddhism from it's source (sarvastivadins, theravadins, etc.) this type of character could never get even a single follower. literally not one. it is stated clearly hundreds of times that a teacher does not drink or sleep around or live in opulence or any of the bad habits this guy had. so if a teacher did these things no one would consider them to have accomplished even a single step on the buddhist path.

however this guy was teaching vajrayana buddhism which is a totally different version of buddhism that is mostly composed of hindu tantra and the bon religion and is hardly buddhist at all. so the hippies, not knowing this, just assumed this was THE buddhism, never realizing they were following some drunkard who was teaching them bon/hindu tantra with a hint of buddhism and had zero qualifications to do so (ie: a drunk who sleeps around to deal with suffering has no business teaching how to end suffering using buddhism). i suppose to be fair if he was clean and sober and celibate (or at least loyal to his wife) and expected his followers to do the same he wouldn't have gotten big in the first place since his followers in the documentary seem to have been mostly a bunch of stoner, free love hippies.

at one point it says he had all of his students bring their marijuana to an event. they all thought he was going to smoke with them but instead he made them burn all their marijuana in a fire place! how is this fair when he is drunk all the time? alcohol is one of the minimum things to abstain from required for a buddhist! it's one of the five precepts!

this movie is wonderful for showing just how dangerous it is to follow someone without knowing what you are learning about in the first place!

even pema chodron states VERY clearly that she has no idea how to justify his drinking and womanizing! and again, it's only because of vajrayanas massive differences from traditional buddhism that he could get away with this at all.

this guy caused a ton of suffering, he ruined relationships by sleeping with his female followers who were married. he married a sixteen year old girl when he was thirty one and then cheated on her for their entire marriage. he taught huge amounts of people his skewed version of buddhism while setting the HORRID example that one can be a womanizing drunkard but also enlightened (which is of course totally impossible).

one of the funniest things is someone talks about how he may have been insane to be able to teach every day for so many years and other teachers tried to emulate him and couldn't do it. really??? anyone can get sauced every day, go blather on about something they were trained well in and then leave the classroom with the prettiest female students for the evening! what is hard about that?

he died before he was fifty likely due to his fast paced party life style.

being one of those cave dwelling ascetics who eat very little, meditate all the time and teaching every day would be difficult. not boozing and womanizing with some ""teaching"" sprinkled in while living in fine lodgings and being waited on hand and foot. yeah he literally had people serving him like a king. that would be super easy, a dream life really. who wouldn't want to be rich, drunk and surrounded by followers?

but again, good message in this movie. it is really eye opening and makes you want to just run for your life any time you hear the words ""crazy wisdom.

also, a bunch of high up vajrayana guys showed up at his funeral! if a traditional buddhist monk from the original buddhism was doing this stuff he would be excommunicated from the buddhist lineage that he came from and not a single person from his lineage would be at his funeral, let alone the higher ups!!! imagine a traditional monk, wife, a ton of women he sleeps with, drunk every day, rich and served like a king in his own ""temple"" he started in america, and then imagine his fellows in the order who aren't allowed to marry without disrobing, who can only own so many possessions, who are not allowed to drink, and so on. he would just be written off the rosters completely.

viewed from most buddhist perspectives, this guy was just plain wrong. viewed from a secular psychology perspective, this guy had some serious psychological problems, suffered from severe alcoholism, and likely suffered from a number of psychological disorders, some created by the alcoholism no doubt and all of them exacerbated by it.

i think it all chalks up to drugs and alcohol. without them there is not a single person who would listen to such a teacher. but people who aren't ready to give up intoxicants, but still want to get into buddhism, look for a version of it that allows them to keep their bad habits and with this guy they found it. not to mention being stoned makes it a lot harder to put two and two together: ""this guy is teaching me how to end suffering with buddhism + he ends his own suffering with booze, riches, and women = he cannot teach me how to end my suffering with buddhism.""",1376438400,4,7715,4.529454022988506
5553207,2,B00B2MJAXS,"I used to have lots of respect for Buddhists but after seeing this film-despite their lifelong quest for ""wisdom"" it seems they are no less susceptable to chicanery than any other group religious or otherwise. It is pretty obvious this guy is just another shyster or huckster in the genre of Elmer Gantry or L. Ron Hubbard. There is some sort of assumption that he is a man of great wisdom but most of what he says could be found in a fortune cookie. He was alcoholic, a philanderer, and conniver. Like David Koresh or Brigham young-he convinces these people that the things he is doing are acceptable even though a number of them go against the basic tenets of Buddhism. The endorsements from an array of people many of whom should have known better-indicate that they were just members of a cult. This guy dressed people up in British servant costumes to serve him and starts a ""militia"". This sounds like the nautical Scientology themes of Hubbard. Boy P. T. Barnum got it right about suckers.",1372723200,9,996,4.632768361581921

5553213,5,B00B2MJAXS,"My first encounter with Trungpa Rinpoche was in the mid-seventies when while in graduate school I was given a copy of Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism. A wonderful and fascinating read, the book propelled me to learn more about its author and his thinking by further exploring his writings. I knew about Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado, which he founded in 1974. And I went to a lecture in New York City where I had a first-hand experience of the incredible power of emptiness of mind when while walking down the aisle to my seat I gazed upon him at the front of the room and experienced a moment of radical nothingness for perhaps the first and last time in my life. I thought I knew a lot about him but Crazy Wisdom opened up a window into his life and work that expanded my knowledge greatly. It is a well-made film by a documentarian who clearly relishes in her subject. He was quite a guy: Monk, philosopher, psychologist, teacher, exile, sensualist and addict, and a unique figure in the crossover of Eastern religion into the late middle twentieth century American cultural terrain of vapid striving for wealth and fame and the pervasive desolation of a bankrupt moral compass. He died at the age of forty-seven in 1987. Crazy Wisdom, a 'camera is there' film, lavishes us with a wonderful assortment of archival footage and a thoughtful and illuminating narrative structure. It does Trungpa justice!",1367366400,28,1418,4.815573770491803
