This was not intended for the hard core trainer or people looking to train professionally. We thought it would be  nice to have a video that teaches everything from dress-up to dramatic dead  dog and show that your dog does not have to be perfect to do any kind of  tricks. I was tired of seeing perfect trainers and perfect dogs doing  perfect tricks, people like to know that their dog may not be perfect but  at least they can have fun teaching them, and it is ok not to be perfect!",959299200,3,593,4.25

Throw the ball and give him a treat when he brings it back. Hello!  The dogs doing the demo's couldn't even complete the tricks.",931651200,13,282,4.365384615384615
