8583067,2,B0009XY1QW,"I've been fishing since I was a kid and thought this would help get me familiar with saltwater.  Most of the fishing I've done is inland on Freshwater.  Mostly Lake Erie, but also in freshwater lakes all over the US.  I'm new to saltwater and looking for a good video to understand the tide and fishing from shore as well.  Offshore salmon fishing in the pacific is great but I don't want to pay a charter everytime I want to go fishing.",1346457600,,437,4.2926829268292686
