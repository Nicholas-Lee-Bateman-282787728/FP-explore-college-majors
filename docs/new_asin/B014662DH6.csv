8729874,5,B014662DH6,One of the funniest cartoons I've ever watched. I read the manga after watching the anime and my only complaint is that the series only went one season. There is so much great source material that never got touched (especially the stuff with Nadeshiko). But what they did manage to fit into these 13 episodes is absolute gold!,1532908800,,326,4.637931034482759

8729876,5,B014662DH6,"This is my favorite anime of all time, hands down. It has great humor and I've so far rewatched the entire series a good 4 times to make all my friends watch it with me. Definitelt got good use out it.",1481068800,,201,3.926829268292683
8729877,4,B014662DH6,"This anime is all over the place. One second sad, another fighting. It's a bit inconsistent too, as the main character is supposed to be a super lucky girl. But she doesn't seem that lucky, though, that may be the point, as the reasons for who she is are revealed. This drives much of the stories, so I ended up liking this one ok. But because they crammed so many pop culture references with all the gear shifts, I kept thinking that there could have been a bit more to the series. I was rather surprised that the end advertises a second season, but I'd get it. I want to see the main characters fleshed out more. The series had enough surprises with all the madness to keep me interested. Not great but certainly good.",1480636800,,720,4.340740740740741

8729881,5,B014662DH6,"I acutely really like this series, though to be honest I don't think that everyone would like it (has a rather inconsistent tone and some raunchy humor) But if you like a pretty well written show with pretty funny (Subjective statement, ok?) jokes then you should pick this one up. For 20 dollars you can't really go wrong here.",1462924800,,328,4.576271186440678
8729882,1,B014662DH6,"I love the show, so I decided I wanted to own a copy of it. Sadly when I opened the DVDs case that says the complete series it only had disk two. And disk one was nowhere to be seen.",1462320000,,182,3.575
