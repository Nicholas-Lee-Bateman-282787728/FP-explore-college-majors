6401732,3,B00K31RC8Y,"This is a very good movie, but Mill Creek Entertainment should not be allowed to release any more Sony films..  Having no menu, or special features is bad enough, but NO SUBTITLES?  The original Sony release featured 9 different subtitles-count them-9!  And a few special features, as well.  And that release is actually selling for a bit less on Amazon right now.  It's the one with ""The Rock"" standing in a black shirt in front of the team.  And it's the one that is reviewed on blu-ray.com in all it's glory, leading you to think that this version has the same features.  The way these blu-rays are released in different versions by different companies, and confusing the hell out of the consumer makes me want to split nails!  Is it the ""extended version"", or the ""directors cut""?  How many times are we going to be asked to double or triple dip, to get the ""ultimate version""?  You sure need to read the fine print when you buy a blu-ray now a days!",1457395200,,954,4.494186046511628

8655538,2,B00K31RC8Y,"This movie is excellent, but if you are going to buy this on blu ray, make sure you buy the one released by Sony (The Rock, Xzbit and some of the team are on the cover)and not this one. This one is done by Mills Creek. So, there are no features, no subtitles and nothing on the menu but the Play option. I wish I had of known but as I said, the movie itself is great",1467158400,,366,3.7662337662337664
