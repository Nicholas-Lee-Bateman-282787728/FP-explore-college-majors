2357607,5,B000A3XY8C,"This is quite a great dvd and it's intense.  There are exercises done standing and on the floor and they all work your abs in every which way.  Some of the standing workout also involves squating so therefore it's working your legs too.  The floorwork is regular stuff like crunches and side planks, so you aren't bored with all this variety.  I love doing this and it should probably be done about 4-5 times a week.  The instructor makes this fun to do.",1127260800,36,454,4.421686746987952

Either I am more out of shape than I thought, or this was a killer workout, because my abs were sore the next day. Could be both, haha. They don't even get that sore doing the Pilates videos I like, which are designed to target the core. Cat, the instructor has a relaxed way of directing. I would have liked more left/right cues though, and maybe a little demo before a few of the moves because I got lost.

A healthy diet and other exercises should be included too. I am 5'2 and weigh 121 lbs. I'm not overweight but sometimes I can receive a little pot belly if I eat junk food too much.

Sadly, for me that translates into someone who is not technically overweight, but has a pudgy round belly and soft hips that keep creeping closer to my armpits.  Have you seen the Barbie turns 50 picture?
Once in a while I care enough about the getting rid of the inner tube to do something about it and I use this video.  I have purchased it twice over several years because it works.  It's easy enough that I can pick it up and get through it without the aid of peer pressure by the second or third time.  Cat is sweet and encouraging.  She mixes things up enough that the repetitions don't get boring.  As I get a bit stronger, I dig deeper and it still feels productive.  Am I ripped by the time I end up stopping?  Nope.

I have taebo and slim in 6 but those workouts where too intense and i couldn't even get to the second day without pulling a muscle. This workout is fun the music helps to keep paste and it is fairly easy. It is medium intense but with no pain at all there is no gain so don't look for an easy way out.

2357717,4,B000A3XY8C,"If you're looking for a workout that is going to focus on pounding your abs into fantastic shape every second of the workout, then this is not for you.  ""Crunch Fat Burning Ab Attack"" is a casual, laid-back approach to working your abs while also burning calories at the same time.  Coming in at about only 30 minutes, it's not the longest workout on the market nor is it the most intense.  It is, however, an enjoyable way to spend an ""off"" day when you still want to work your core a bit.

It all starts with a warm-up which is almost like a dance routine.  It has step touches, hamstring curls, V steps, and mambos.  It simply starts to slightly raise the heart rate and get the blood flowing.  Some quick stretches follow.  It takes about 6 minutes to complete.

Standing abs is next; there are two sections of this portion of the DVD.  Each section has about 4 moves: 2 for lower body and 2 for abs.  Your heart rate will still be barely elevated because there is a lot of squatting and some quick leg lifts.  Usually, Cat Chiarelli (the instructor) will teach you a slow oblique move such as a standing oblique crunch.  You'll do that move 8-16 times slowly, do something like 8 fast squats, then do the same slow oblique move on the other side of your body.  Eventually, the tempo will be picked up, you will do it quickly a few times, and then move onto another exercise.  At the end of each section, you put all moves together into a combo.  I didn't find any of the standing abs moves to be tough on the abs; it more worked my thighs and butt with all of the squats.  However, my heart rate was up a bit, and I did enjoy it.  It all lasts a little bit less than 15 minutes.

Floor abs are the follow-up to standing abs, and they are more traditional in that you are doing familiar crunches and planks.  There are some different crunch variations, though, so you won't get bored.  I'm used to difficult ab workouts, and this did burn a bit...never so much that I had to take a break, but it did seem quite effective.  I really liked this (approximately) 10 minute section and will probably add it (and only it) as a supplement to other workouts that I do.

A quick 2 minute cool down finishes off the workout.

Cat is a pleasant instructor.  She comes across as a bit cheesy, constantly asking if you're ""cool.""  However, she really is fantastic about making sure your form is good.  Another helpful thing that she does is give you metaphors for some of the exercises.  For instance, in the crunches you're supposed to imagine an orange between your chin and chest.  In one of the standing exercise, visualize a ballerina's posture.

I've seen better standing ab workouts (Jennifer Galardi's Standing Abs on exercisetv), but I understand that Cat was trying to use this section to focus on cardio more than abs.  It's very light, though, so it's best for a beginner.  The floor abs was very effective for me, although it could have been a bit longer.  Overall, I recommend this DVD as a very light workout for your days ""off.""  It's also really good for beginners who are easing into fitness.",1325894400,2,3101,4.420494699646643
2357728,4,B000A3XY8C,"This DVD provides a good ab routine with a very nice trainer.  Her voice is pleasant and she cues well.  The music matched the routine and was not distracting.  It also does a bit on working the rear so I was happy with that as well.

2357730,5,B000A3XY8C,"I have always struggled with my weight and body shape. Years running, biking (marathon/triathlon), periods of weight loss yet my body shape remained the same... that was UNTIL I found this DVD!

THIS DVD RESHAPED MY BODY, IS SHORT, EFFECTIVE & SPUNKY!

I believe this DVD targeted areas that had not been previously targeted, boosting my metabolism while re-shaping my core!!

Purchased on a whim (not the type to work out at home) with 5 other DVDs that soon collected dust not this one! I started using it every day and it made a real difference!
3-4 years later I am still using!!! (I actually bought a second copy and it was worth every penny!)

The work out is applicable for all fitness levels, it challenged me from the start and as you get stronger you simply push yourself harder so it continues to improve your performance! (but if you don't I can see how you may plateau and I admit some days I would do the routine twice, it was that much fun!) The transitions are quick enough that you can make it through the tough spots even when it burns burns burns!

I love the instructor, the direction she gives to motivate proper alignment, her attitude is a bit of sass. The one thing they could use is an instructional section, but a few run throughs and I was ready to go!

For those already ripped and shredded sure maybe this is not for you, but for those who never thought they could be, give this a try it may help you find a bit of definition that you never thought you could have, while at the same time having fun!!!

I never thought I would like to touch my sides or look at them in the mirror... thank you Catherine Chiarelli I wish you had more DVDs!! :(

ps. whoever said it was like Tae-Bo lite I believe that is because it uses some boxing similar moves...",1264118400,2,1776,4.36060606060606

this and the original buns of steel make me look the way i do

i love this movie and the crunch bootcamp dvd too

they really make it easy for the normal person who cant dance, and who cant go to a gym class to workout with out being embaressed. like me
i love them!!!!
after a few months i might go to the gym or i might just but a new DVD  cause im a pro model and actor and it makes me look just like the girls  who go to the gym every day

2357732,4,B000A3XY8C,"This video works-- well and quickly. The ""crunch crew""'s energy is infectious and Catherine Chiarelli is engaging. I've been doing ab workouts for some time and I tried this routine because I was frustrated at having hit a plateau, and I wanted something more intense to produce visible results. Because I run or hike on alternate days, I wasn't really interested in all the squats and other leg strengtheners involved in the cardio portion of the workout, so I frequently do extra reps of the ab movements while the people in the video are squatting or lunging. That may have upped the intensity of my workout, but this routine is generally well choreographed and well, well worth the effort.",1245628800,,693,4.831932773109243
2357733,4,B000A3XY8C,"Good half hour workout but don't expect to sweat. This workout is mainly standing ab moves which end with a little mat work.
The workout mainly concentrates on the obliques with a little upper ab work. Unfortunately there is no lower ab work which is what I was looking for. The instructors' cuing is very good.
This is a good workout if you already have firm flat abs, but if you are looking to lose inches, this is not the workout for you. Also there is hardly any stretching at the end which would have been nice to have on this dvd.",1235260800,,536,4.264705882352941

In order for this to work you must remember to keep you abdominal muscles ""engaged"" while performing the exercises (which the instructor reminds you of periodically), if not this or any other ab workout video will be a waste of your time (which I suspect is what happened to the people who gave this a bad review).

Overall, I feel it in my abs, but don't expect it to be a substitute for a your cardio workout.

Just FYI if you're wondering what perspective this is coming from, I'm in my mid-20's and work out 5x a week strength training and running appx. 60 mins.  I got this video to target my abs.",1228003200,,771,4.147651006711409

2357736,3,B000A3XY8C,"As is on the DVD, this workout is one that you will grow out of quickly if you are in halfway decent shape, but to ramp it up a bit on the standing section, you could use either weighted gloves or the dumbbells used by walkers with the straps that go across the back of your hand (so it is harder, but not impossible, to drop them).

Also, you really have to remember to keep your abs engaged throughout the standing workout or you will get no benefit from it at all since it is very short. Some movements you can follow through on much more than the instructor does (what she calls ""lunges"", for example, look more like one is just swaying to and fro) to increase range of motion and get more of a workout.

The standing work does have a lot of squats which might be an issue for those with bad knees, and the instructor uses a lot of fast repetitions on balance moves where slower moves would give you a more difficult workout in the same amount of time. Luckily, she ""stops"" to cue the next moves several times while marching in place, so even if you decide to perform the moves more slowly, you'll still be able to catch up to the next sequence.

The mat work is basic, but on the short side. Since the DVD is chaptered, you can repeat the segment.

It is an okay workout, but overpriced considering how short it is. Buy used.

2357737,4,B000A3XY8C,"I will preface this review by stating my fitness background:  I do triathlons (often, but slowly) and have a fairly strong (though not defined) core from doing so many different sports.  I occasionally will actually do some sit-ups after a run, or do a pilates video on a non-cardio day, but I rarely purposely did ab work before.  So if you exercise less than me, or for some reason have weak core muscles, you obviously might have different experiences with the video.  I have done MANY workout videos over the years and taken many fitness classes to put some variety in my workouts.
As stated before, the format of the video is a brief standing warm-up and then cardio moves with a focus on ab- and core-related activities.  Then some good old sit-ups on the mat, followed by side planks and some back work with an ultra-quick stretch at the end.
The warm-up was pretty good, loosening up lots of muscle groups and raising the heart-rate, and including stretches after the body was warmed up a bit (yay!  I hate stretching before warming up.)  I am usually slow on the uptake when it comes to anything requiring memorizing steps, but this routine systematically builds up and is pretty easy to follow.  Then right into standing ab work/cardio.  I did NOT find this at all challenging to my abs.  There are a lot of squats, so I actually felt it in my butt and upper legs more--even the next day.  Not that that is a bad thing, but my legs and butt are way stronger than my core...  Perhaps if the instructor gave a bit more instruction about what muscles to tighten, or more detailed directions about the move, one could work their abs better with the standing moves, but that wasn't done.  Yes, a lot of the moves were 'Tae-Bo lite' as stated in earlier reviews, but they originally come from boxing and boxers do have good abs.  Maybe upping the reps--a lot--would help.  There are some sort-of-balance-based moves, and despite my usual clumsiness I didn't find these too difficult.  A small variation for the uncoordinated is also given and I used that the first couple times.
The mat work was pretty basic, and not too challenging.  The same moves, with more sets, might be a better challenge for many people.  The plank moves were challenging the first couple times, but quickly became easy (even though I only do this video 1 time per week).  I think the mat section would be substantially improved by having different levels for the sit-ups and plank work.  Also, some of the top-rated abdominal moves according to most sports-medicine studies were not included, like the bicycle.
So, while I found this DVD to get my heart-rate up and focus on my abs more than most 30 minute workouts, it wasn't super challenging.  I do it once a week on a non-running day, and like that it does leave me feeling the squats.  I have had to add some challenge to the plank moves and the sit-ups in order to feel like I've pushed myself on the abs, but the instructor is good enough that it doesn't grow too annoying.  I would rank this as in the top-10 of the 50+ exercise videos I have done.  It is one of only four that I use regularly.  The major negative points are lack of focused instruction for the moves and the lack of different levels of difficulty.",1214352000,,3253,4.557659208261618

2357749,5,B000A3XY8C,"I have been using this ab DVD for over a year but had never read the reviews listed. I was actually searching for another DVD by this same company or presenter and found these reviews. I can tell you after using the routine for as long as I have that it really does work. I use it almost every other day and in between I use Ellen Barrett's Pilates or Work out DVD's. I can see that just this ab DVD alone would not be as effective, but supplemented with others you can get results. It is certainly not a quick fix, however. It will take some time to see results but suddenly you will notice a much tighter oblique muscle and the stomach definition you want. After you use this DVD for a few months you will also notice that the workout does intensify and you can ""feel"" your abs during the workout. Stick with it and don't be fooled by the negative comments found here. I do recommend that you pair it with Pilates if you want a true abdominal workout with great results!

I agree with the concept of needing both cardio fat burning and ab work to get yourself a happy midsection, but the problem is that it's just not that intense and does both part way.  I think that if you are just getting back into shape it would be good, but if you want the intensity one needs to get anywhere close to the stomach that the instructor has, you are going to need another video.",1204588800,,501,4.144329896907217

She also seems out of her element leading the work-out and is a bit too cheerleader-ish for my taste. But, the concept and workout are so good, I found I no longer cared about that.

Two things to complain about is the length and the instructor cues.  It's only 30 mins.  I believe to get a better workout it should have been stretched to at least 45 mins.  The instructor is good at times on her cues but then starts to slack off and assumes everyone knows how to do the Mambo for se.

2357772,4,B000A3XY8C,"I really want to work my abs, but I hate doing zillions of crunches (zillion as in anything more than ten), so I thought I'd give this DVD a try.

First of all, it's not really DVD-like in a sense that that are no chapters to choose from (no bonus workout either), so it's your good old VHS-type of workout: you start from the beginning, finish at the end and that's that.

What's between the beginning and the end left me a bit undecided. Cat is a nice instructor, sweet without being overwhelming, but don't expect cueing of any kind. I was wondering if this lack of cues was the reason for me not exactly feeling the work in my abs in the approximately 15 minutes of standing work; I was doing some sweating all right, and I did feel my thighs working, but as far as my abs go, nothing really felt there. I've just read a few other reviews here and am kinda relieved I'm not the only one, so it's probably not that I'm not doing the exercises right.

The matwork is... well, matwork. About 10 minutes of crunches, side crunches, side planks and all that. Now, I definitely felt THOSE in my abs, but hey, we all do - that's why most of us hate these exercises.

So, I could say a little less than half of this workout (the second half, that is) contains some tough abs work, and the other half contains virtually none, but I'm still giving it 4 stars, because after finishing it I always feel like I HAVE done some useful work for my body, and I guess that's what really matters at the end of the day.",1163980800,3,1503,4.2264808362369335

It did get my heart rate up and have me sweating but I really didn't feel my abs burning at any point.  I did feel my legs burning though.  The floor portion of the dvd was very good.  The instructor has you doing lots of different styles of crunches that have your abs shaking and screaming for it to be over.  The next day I was very sore.  All in all I think that the dvd was a good buy and it did a good job on the cardio and the ab portion on the floor.  I don't regret the purchase.",1161043200,,785,3.9426751592356686
2357774,2,B000A3XY8C,The DVD isn't a good abs workout or a cardio video.  The section on obliques at the end is good but only a few minutes.  The instructor was motivational but I didn't find the moves that creative or intense.,1159142400,,206,4.256410256410256

I don't remember 3 very well because I've only done it once so far, but the squats were effective since they made me pretty sore. 4 & 5 are definitely the best parts, and I've been skipping right to them. There's lots of variety and it leavs my abs feeling like they've been worked out pretty decently. I'd recommend doing that part twice if you want. It's about 10 minutes.

2357798,3,B000A3XY8C,"...unfortunately it didn't do anything for me and I am one who could use ab work.  Catherine Chiarelli leads this 30 minute routine and is joined by several other ladies and one man.  You start with a simple warmup consisting of marches, step touches, hamstring curls, v-steps and mambos, then you stretch briefly.

You start with standing work and I agree with the reviewer who called some of these moves ""Tae Bo Lite"".  The moves seen here include torso twists, boxer twists, standing oblique crunches, and clock twists.  The boxer and clock twists are done while in a plie squat position, after a while I could feel my legs working pretty hard, but this section didn't do much for my abs, though I liked the moves in general.  Lots of squats and side lunges are inserted in between some of the ab work so it breaks it up a little bit.

The floor work I felt more than the standing, but it was still pretty easy.  Here you will see traditional crunches, one set of them with legs in the air at a 90 degree angle, oblique twists, double crunches, leg sweeps, side planks with knees bent, lying side oblique crunches and Supermans.

Catherine does an okay job leading the workout, she does offer some pointers and tips throughout, as well as reminding you to breathe.  She is in fantastic shape herself, though I don't know if she got those abs doing this workout.  The routine itself was unique and interesting, especially the standing work but it wasn't working for me.  Anyone whose abs are in decent condition will not be challenged by this workout.  Overall I will give it 3 stars for effort.",1145145600,13,1597,4.580985915492958

2357802,3,B000A3XY8C,"Instructor Catherine Chiarelli takes you through a warm-up, a standing cardio workout and a mat ab workout that felt to me, in places, like Tae-bo Lite.  Not that it was like Tae-bo in that it features kickboxing, but in the moves she uses to work the abs from a standing position, several of which Tae-bo fans will recognize.  Following is a glimpse of each segment:

Warm-Up:  A standard, relatively easy-to-follow cardio warm-up featuring marching in place, step-touch to the side, kickback, V-step, mambo and stretches.  The only thing I found awkward was the mambo step.  I've done a mambo step in several other workouts and always found it one of my favorites...until now.

Standing Ab Work:  Cat focuses on abs at a moderate cardio pace with squats, oblique twists, plies, boxer twists, side lunges, standing side crunches, and upper body twists.  If you've done Tae-bo, you will recognize several of these moves.  Like Tae-bo, you need excellent balance for this.  The intensity was enough to get my breathing elevated and I did sweat some, but not as much as I usually would during a cardio workout.  I really didn't feel my abs being worked as much as I would expect in an ab-focused workout.  I've only done this workout twice so far, but I am not sold on the benefits of this segment.

Mat Ab Work:  Down on the floor, you'll do several variations of crunches, side planks, oblique work, Superman variations, and stretches.  It's a silly thing, I suppose, but I really didn't like doing mat work after I'm sweaty from doing a cardio workout (even though I wasn't AS sweaty from this as I would be from, say, Tae-bo).  The repetitions here are higher than other ab workouts I've done and, as a result, I found this section tough.  I could do the various crunches for 8 or 10 reps but she does 15 reps and I couldn't ""hang in there"" for the last several reps of each crunch.  This was especially true because she does a LOT of crunches with the legs in the air, one right after the other, so you're not getting any opportunity to rest.

All in all, certainly not a BAD workout, but not real high on my list of recommends either.  It felt inconsistent because the standing section was easier than expected and the mat section was harder than expected...so it's hard to know who to recommend this workout to.  The people who could handle the tough mat section would find the standing section too easy and the people who would find the standing section just right would find the mat section too hard.",1139097600,60,2507,4.624434389140271

 *A video being too difficult too soon, with moves only a Marine or an Olympic athlete can do, that made me feel worse about myself.
 *Someone so perky, they made me want to have a cocktail, just to keep from kicking my TV in.
 *Someone yelling at me nonstop, and apparently...finding me lacking. *eyeroll* whatever. :P

 But this work out is spot on. It has a gentle warm up, then digs deeper with moves that increase in difficulty. Included are a few other exercises, that while not strictly ab moves, provide me with a more rounded workout. They target parts of the body, that by close connection, do indeed effect the abs. All the exercises are explained simply and demonstrated well. The 30 minute length is perfect for me also. Just what I can fit in on a typically busy day.
  So if you want something that can help get you started exercising, ease you back into exercising, or something effective you can do in 30 minutes, then this video will do all those things. And you'll be glad you did.  :)",1498694400,,1491,4.381818181818182
