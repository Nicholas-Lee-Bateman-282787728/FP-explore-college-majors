Firstly, it is a remarkable example of film making, it takes us behind the scenes of the 1988 recording of the Dvorak cello concerto with Julian Lloyd Webber and the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Vaclav Neumann. There aren't many documentaries out there that show us the making of a classical recording, it's quite amazing how quick and intense the whole process is! The picture quality and attention to detail is stunning, considering it was filmed over 25 years ago.
Secondly, it reveals the political context, the ideas of freedom and Czech identity which feature in the documentary and which are still very relevant with the struggle for freedom we can see in some countries around the world at present.
Thirdly, it gives us an insight into the life of Antonin Dvorak and the fascinating -yet tragic- story behind the writing of the cello concerto. This is done in a very clever way by the narrator. There are similarities with the lives of other composers (Elgar comes to mind) and how they affected their works, particularly the late ones.
The whole documentary is just under an hour long, extremely informative and entertaining. It's truly amazing how much effort goes into the recording of a concerto, how everybody from musicians and conductor to sound engineers contribute to the final result. Now that Julian Lloyd Webber has retired from playing the cello this documentary acquires extra special significance, as it shows the cellist at the top of his career. Surely he must have learnt alot collaborating with so many different great orchestras and conductors worldwide. It wouldn't surprise me at all if we were to see him come back as conductor before long.",1404777600,,1746,4.942176870748299
