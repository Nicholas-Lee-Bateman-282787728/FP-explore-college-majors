2720693,5,B000M3A9MY,"I'm a big fan of Bollywood (even though I'm not Indian!). I've watched dozens of Bollywood films, including the most famous ones and I have to say that this is one of the best I've ever seen. It's on par with Dilwale Dulhani Le Jayenge and the other classics. It's also based on a true story! I absolutely love Shahid Kapoor and he shines in this movie. Very highly recommended! A movie to watch over and over again!",1223683200,4,416,4.346153846153846

2720695,4,B000M3A9MY,"At first, I thought that there was no point to this film. There really isn't any plot and the hatred of the aunt towards her niece seemed a bit forced. However, this film is meant to be a celebration of marriage. Viewed through that perspective, this is a great family film. Sashid and Amrita are charming together. Their characters take you through the rituals of marriage, right from their initial engagement through their courtship and eventual marriage. A great way to spend an evening with family.",1197244800,5,502,4.848837209302325
2720696,4,B000M3A9MY,"Idealistically portraying India as it could still be.

Poonam & Prem's marriage is arranged when a zealous salesman/cousin/matchmaker visits the village (Madhupur)where Poonam resides with her family.

To a backdrop of most glorious scenery (of the humble Indian variety, none of this whimsical across the world adventures) Prem and Poonam learn each others natures & fall most happily in love.

Parents can know best!

Encouraging the traditional values & a dignity and respect of culture, Vivah is a movie I really revelled in.

The house in Madhupur, with it's temple room, open central courtyard, large balconies & Krsna adorning each wall, must be an idealised image now, as more barren westernized architecture, decoration & ideals are sold more and more forcefully in the East.

The jewellery, costumes, scenery - heavenly.

With a delightful ensemble cast, Vivah enchants on every level.
Shahid Kapur acting as Prem, and Poonam from Amrita Rao are very good - but it is the support cast who really shine.

Ok one concession - it is a little slow moving, especially the last half.

8166051,5,B000M3A9MY,"Vivah, I love this movie, is my favorite romantic story. So innocent but at the same time pure and strong love, an unconditional love, that is what it is, Vivah. A movie for all ages  and it makes you believe in love again and you fall In love again.
The dvd came with no issues, flawless, as the seller described. The service was excellent and the shipping very fast, in fact, the dvd arrived before the expected date.

8166054,4,B000M3A9MY,"Poonam possesses such a rare beauty and congeniality that everyone she meets immediately adores her. Yet, this could not replace the love of parents, who were taken away when she was young. Fortunately, she had an uncle that loved her like a daughter. However, her aunt- his wife- was severely jealous of her because she thought of her as more precious than her own daughter, so she distanced herself from Poonam. Therefore, Poonam never knew the love of a mother.

Prem possesses everything typical heir has, good education, good lifestyle and good looks. Still, as good as it all was, he lacked a good sense of direction, but it did not bother him one bit at the moment because he was enjoying his youth. That is until his father is approached with a marriage proposal for him - one with a simple, country girl with honest, wholesome values: Poonam.

Apprehensive at first, Prem relents when he gazes at Poonam's photo and it becomes love at first sight. This sentiment only deepens after he meets her for the first time. From that point on, Prem has found his direction: to please Poonam. Tragically, disaster occurs on Prem and Poonam's wedding day that could tear the ""perfect"" couple apart. I truly enjoyed this film and had to add it to my collection. It sort of reminds me of Cinderella with a Bollywood spin.",1237939200,,1317,4.696969696969697
8166055,5,B000M3A9MY,"This is a simple plot; almost a documentary of how an arranged marriage is chosen and the steps thereafter to the marriage itself (with a hiccup and plot twist in the second half being the only diversion from this).
It is a bit of propaganda for arranged marriages and how they could be... if they were 2 stunning people with deeply loving natures and a natural connection made in heaven..and parents who consulted them fully... oh and wealthy in laws with very good hearts... and a loving devoted father and sister... and a beautiful country house in gorgeous scenery...! No wonder it doesn't always work out like this!
The realists will find this movie too syrupy as so many of the characters are 'nice'. It does go into lengthy detail on various marital rituals too. However giving it less than a 5 would almost be like criticizing newspapers if they filled up on good news.
This movie is really a reminder of how all of us could transact our loving interactions in a kindly and humane manner. It shows deep love developing and as it could be between pure-hearted people. Now that is something nice to hang out with for a change! It's like social commentary that goes for showing you a better way rather than exposing the underbelly of a problem.
Shahid Kapoor is always a delight to watch and does a great job with this plot. I am now starting to look out for his movies. He is still young and has a lot of potential. He brings the requisite pure warm innocence and honesty - and good looks (he is a very beautiful young man).
Amrita Rao similarly plays the pure-hearted, kindly, coy yet quietly capable and intelligent, bride to be.
All other actors add strength to this group- from those playing fathers and in-laws, to the only character with a shadow over them: the bride's 'mother' (who naturally sees the error of her ways in the end).
There are a few nice dances and some pleasant music (one which was in my head after which is a good sign) and beautiful photography.
My DVD was a 'Collector's Edition' which I presume means a lot of people have found this one to treasure. Two age groups watched this at my house- late 20s and mid 50s and both age-groups found it good. Recommended for those with good hearts who are touched by loving human-beings and love itself.",1230940800,,2276,4.553658536585366
