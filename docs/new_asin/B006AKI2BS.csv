8495784,4,B006AKI2BS,"On this Top Gear tie-in product we see James May and Richard Hammond take the viewer on a series of rather ridiculous adventues loosely based on the idea of cars in films. So we see (or due to the fact it is a BBC production we hear) a lot of talk about great chase scenes and discussion of how integral the car has been to the cinema.

Or at least that is the premise. Really it is just an excuse of more of the usual Top Gear tomfoolery where we see a motor race between a range of movie set logistical style buildings, a multi part discussion of the noises of different cars and the screen presence of the respective noises, a race between a jet powered bloke and a rally car, a segment where the manoeuvrability of a couple of cars are put to the test and a multi-part transformation of a Range Rover into a Bond car. Ummm errr.... it kinda makes more sense when you actually see it.

As this only goes for around an hour and a quarter and is really just a tie-in to make more money you have to ask yourself how badly you need it. But if you are a fan you'll probably want it in your collection somewhere. Or drop a hint that you want it for your next birthday or something because much of it is quite entertaining.",1398297600,,1219,4.139240506329114
