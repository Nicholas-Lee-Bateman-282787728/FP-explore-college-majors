8707785,1,B00UOW1ZCQ,"Obviously heavily influenced by layered genre fare out of Korea and Japan in particular, with a plot essentially ripped off from the brilliant CURE, this over-baked, self-conscious effort is simply irritating overall. And, to add insult to injury, it turns out of be a ""part 1""!",1454284800,,278,5.065217391304348

8707787,2,B00UOW1ZCQ,"It goes on and on.  I kept trying to finish watching it because it must be about something--but I gave up.  There are good looking people.  There is karate.  There is a magic amulet.  There is male/female attraction.  There is something supernatural.  There is fighting, dying and killing.  But I'll be damned of I could say how it was all connected.  I liked parts of it.  Other parts were just lame.",1448755200,,401,4.52112676056338
8707788,2,B00UOW1ZCQ,"Acting was terrible. The story so unrealistic too. There was a hint of potential in the mystery, But they really killed it with the ""to be continue part II"" ending that was not an ending.",1448582400,,187,4.371428571428571
8707789,3,B00UOW1ZCQ,"A beautiful girl with a lovely doll face has the ability to solve crimes while staring off into space to a backdrop of lovely violin concertos. I already guessed correctly why. The problem is that about an hour in, the movie loses its mystery solving quality and turns exclusively into a 'lets try to mind-F the viewer type of movie. The lovely music gives way as more annoying sounds are frequently played instead. Imagine giving a 2 year old a bozo the clown toy horn, and letting them honk it for 5 minutes straight without end. Yes... that sound effect is in the movie. By the end of the movie I chose to keep my sound muted and just read the subtitles instead. Thats why I rate this a 3 instead of a 5.

Random 11 seems to want to be like the movie called 'Seven' but it doesn't quite get there. If you want the perfect experience from this movie, stop watching it when the bozo horn sounds. Then.... walk away. :) Your own imagination will make a better ending than the one this movie predictably spews out and you would not be missing anything.",1448236800,2,1051,4.362244897959184
