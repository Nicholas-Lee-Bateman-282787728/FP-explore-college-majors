8476615,3,B0013KRZ4U,"Compared to ""The Strauss Family"" and it's actors,  I only give a 3 rating for The Strauss Dinasty, and for the story and for the actors,  too much history, not enough music,",1389830400,,173,4.375
8476616,5,B0013KRZ4U,"Excellent movie! Beautifully made! Did not stopped watching until the end of the last part. Actors are chosen very well and acted outstanding. Costumes, Environment, Music - everything is great. You just live the Strausses lives, laugh and cry with them and of course you sing waltzes many days after watching the movie. I believe the reviewer who gave 1 star did not review movie, but this particular DVD edition. I highly recommend this movie to everyone who likes music, very good performance and the atmosphere of old times.. You won't be disappointed.",1381017600,2,556,4.989247311827957
8476617,1,B0013KRZ4U,There is no way to switch off the Dutch subtitles on this dvd. What's more they are very obtrusive - they're larger than usual and higher up on the picture.,1376956800,5,156,4.233333333333333
