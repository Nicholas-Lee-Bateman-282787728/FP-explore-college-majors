8584377,4,B00CP77VQC,"I really loved it. I got it for a Christmas gift from my sister. I had gone on a visit to see her and my family for Christmas and she had one and I really feel in love with it. So she sent me one for Christmas and I showed it to my husband and he wanted one, so I got him one about two weeks after I got mine. The problem is his has just worked great but mine doesn't even work anymore. It just up and quit. First the remote stopped working and I called Amazon and they said they were out of them at that time but they also said they would call me back in two weeks when they should be getting some more in and that they would send me one. I NEVER HEARD FROM THEM and I couldn't call them back because I couldn't find the number my husband had gotten some how. They don't list a phone number so you can call them. Then the stick just up and stopped working about two months after the remote stopped. I really enjoyed it while it was working. My husband's stick is still working. I'd love to go and watch his tv, but sadly we don't have the same taste in programs. Amazon, if you read these reviews, please find out why my remote and fire stick just stopped working. I feel like they should send me a new one to replace this one. It shouldn't have stopped working after a couple of months. I want another one so bad. I would have gave this review five stars but for the problems I had and now I'm without one. I really miss it.",1530576000,,1426,3.954861111111111
8584378,5,B00CP77VQC,"Very surprising movie. Great acting,especially when Macready introduced as sleazy prosecutor,soon to be open target in prison. Hayward,not the handsome hero anymore,turns in a great performance as ""Romeo"",and De Kelley,from Star Trek has a bit part as the cop who arrests Macready (Winant) for bribery. Paul Kelly excellent,too as Duffy.",1470441600,,337,5.76

I had no idea that San Quentin was in Marin County California. So my sojourn into prison life began with this film. What a journey and very impressed with the treatment of the delicate subject of wrongly imprisoned inmates. I was horrified by the corporal punishment routinely relinquished by hardened guards.

I have no experience in trying to tame unruly, ruthless, evil criminals and imagine that San Quentin saw the worst of them. How could a brand new warden make an impact. Well, this story provides an insight on how to make a difference. How well this Hollywood version is true to the facts is unknown but I know well that one person can definitely make a difference in this world.

High recommend for perspectives on obstinate determined and wife loving wardens who strive for excellence. I pray for the many wrongfully imprisoned people who deserve a second chance to prove their innocence.",1447286400,,942,4.875
8584381,3,B00CP77VQC,"The subject of the title of the film was a great warden who, through his resourceful innovative management skills did a tremendous job of reforming San Quentin Prison. This film does not quite do justice to the title's character. It takes a lot of poetic liberties with the real story of San Quentin under Warden Duffy's tenure. It would have been better to tell the story the way it really was instead of this drivel. One part that does seem correct, is the relationship between Clinton Duffy and his wife Gladys portrayed with sensitivity by Maureen O'Sullivan.",1399680000,,563,4.814432989690721
8584382,3,B00CP77VQC,"Louis Hayward, the leading actor and Walter Doniger the director put together a relatively low budget picture shot on location at San Quentin prison with a star or near in almost every part. Joanne Dru, Maureen O'Sullivan, George Macready and the unsung Irving Bacon. Produced independently and placed with WB for distribution, its success lead to a sequel, The Steel Cage, using left over footage and episodes of an unsold Duffy of San Quentin television series. For what it is, well done.",1369872000,,490,4.987804878048781
