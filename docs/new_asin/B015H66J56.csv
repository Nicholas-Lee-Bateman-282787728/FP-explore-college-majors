7436809,5,B015H66J56,"Plot...
A late night train out of London on a dark stormy night comes to a halt in a forest half way through its journey, the ticket collector Joe becomes an unlikely hero as he does his best to help the passengers remain calm, but something unimaginable is waiting outside for them!!

This is an unmissable British werewolf horror, I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish, probably another of the years top horror releases, the story is great fun, its paced out well with plenty going on, there's plenty of great building tension once the action kicks in, the movie has a really good cast of characters, your usual stereotypes that you love and hate but not entirely predictable, the effects are spot on all the way, the train and the location etc all looks genuine and work really well, the werewolf effects are great, some of the scariest for sure in long while, some amazing make-up effects from the creators of the creatures from the descent movies, there's plenty of bloody gore, the werewolf's get some good screen time and look really frightening, the movie has a great dark creepy tone all the way through and works on every level, it helps too that the great music score and sound effects build good tension too, if you love a good classic creature-monster movie with plenty of blood and is plenty fun at the same time then be sure to check out this horror gem!! certainly worth plenty repeat viewings!!

7436810,4,B015H66J56,"Ed Speelers (Plastic;) plays Jo a train guard who gets bumped into doing a double shift on a train that is going off into the wilds of the home counties. The passengers,  are a disparate bunch and all bring something different to the party. Then the train breaks down and nor before long they realise they are not alone as some very strong and hairy creature starts to attack them.

Then they have to band together to survive. This also has Sean Pertwee in it but if he is the pull factor for you then think again as he gets a mere few minutes on screen. The budget restraints were on show for a large part of this film, but the acting was all pretty good. The creature make up was all very good too. That is probably because director Paul Hyett is a prosthetics effects designer.

It has a few surprises but does not bring very much to the werewolf genre that we have not seen before, Dog Soldiers was much better but had more money to play with. Still I always like an independent effort and this did try to scare  so 3.5 stars being rounded up to 4.",1450569600,7,1052,4.218905472636816

7436814,4,B015H66J56,This movie provides a different take on werewolf.  The werewolf doesn't look like your typical one but nonetheless a fearsome looking beast.  The characters do have their dumb moments but the movie provide a good horror atmosphere.  Makes you think what if something of the sort was isolated in a forest near you,1446422400,4,312,4.849056603773585
7436815,4,B015H66J56,On a dark stormy night a passenger train out of London breaks down in a secluded forest.  The conductor ventures out to inspect the train and disappears.  Shortly thereafter the passengers and crew realize they're being stalked by an as yet unknown creature.  I'm not really into werewolf movies however this was a good film.  The story and acting were excellent and the gore wasn't overdone.  Sean Pertwee of Dog Soldiers even had a brief cameo.  It's a shame he wasn't given a larger part but it was a good film nonetheless.,1445990400,16,526,4.663043478260869
7436816,4,B015H66J56,"Joe (Ed Speleers) is the guard or conductor on a midnight train out of London. We discover he was passed over for a promotion and is working a double shift. After we get 10 minutes of his boring character, we get to know the passengers by his brief encounters as he checks their tickets. It is a rainy night. There is a full moon and Joe doesn't get any respect from his passengers ""why don't you get a real job.""

The train is soon forced to a stop, surrounded by woods. We anticipate the struggle that is about to commence and have already decided who we want to see die first and survive. The DVD cover reveals the face of the creature described as a werewolf in the write-up. In reality it is more like an Urak-hai Orc with the face of a Morlock and wolf legs. You will get to see plenty of it, just hang in there.

A strong 3 1/2 stars.

7436817,2,B015H66J56,"This is a pretty poor example of a decent werewolf movie.  A couple actors are good but mostly they're not.  This is especially true of ""Jenny"".

There are no great special effects in the style of American Werewolf in London.  What is seen is already transformed.  This is not a movie I'm ever likely to intentionally watch again.",1517011200,,330,4.620689655172414
7436818,4,B015H66J56,"I was really surprised at how good this was. A new spin on werewolves, making them more physical creatures than supernatural monsters. And the cast was brilliant. Clever viewers will catch on that the passengers on the train act much like a pack of animals themselves at first, complete with an alpha male. Highly recommended for horror fans.

7436828,4,B015H66J56,"A neglected film on this side of the pond.  True, the cover art is beyond campy - it nearly deterred me until I look the film up on rottentomatoes.com.  A young attendant who works on a train in England is denied a promotion.  More than that, he asked by his new supervisor to take the midnight shift.  He reluctantly agrees and runs into the attractive attendant who serves light fare on said train.  She also knows of his failure to get the position, another bitter brew to swallow on his part.  What really messes things up, though, is the fact that the train comes to an abrupt halt in the middle of a dense forest.  Soon, people are missing with no account - that or they've been attacked by howling, humanoid beasts.  How to get out of this mess without changing into one of them becomes the sole concern.  The writing in this piece is solid, entertaining.  It follows one plot line - escape - so it is not the most original movie in the world but one must decide what is good fun and what is good for the frontal cortex.  This hits the former.  The cast is quite good.  They play their roles without devolving into spray cheese, quite notable in the horror genre.  The direction is calm.  There is no room for frenetic, wild cameras capturing every moment.  Both the direction and the production come together to produce a rather stately horror film about werewolves (who, in this film, look more like the Uruk-hai from ""Lord of the Rings""), a mythology that seems to live more in England than in other Germanic countries.  In any case, by evoking a sense of dread, paranoia and claustrophobia berimed with twice-told tales, this film deserves more than a glance.",1501372800,7,1670,4.531772575250836

7436843,4,B015H66J56,"We can judge this two ways:
 1) Compare it to epic, big budget, large screen movies and it gets 3 stars
or
 2) As a good, old school B-Movie for a Creature Feature night at home, on a slow weekend, then it gets a 4 Stars.

It does have decent-to-good acting. This is probably a made for TV movie  in the UK, so the acting tends to be a lot better in those types of movies than the average TV movie here in the States. The premise is decent: it's the last train out of London that night and it breaks down in the middle of a wooded area and is isolated for several hours. This is an acceptable premise because many suburban areas have wooded patches and it doesn't have to be a large National Forest to feel isolated with the fog in the dead of night and you don't have to be isolated for more than a couple of hours for it to happen. The suspension of disbelief and feeling of isolation was well done. The behavior of some of the characters can sometimes have the typical dumb behavior that a lot of other horror movies have. But at the same time, it wouldn't be if you consider that a normal person is never really expecting some supernatural monster waiting for them out there when they decide to see what's wrong with the equipment.

The action takes some time to start but it is good without being too much and taking away from the story. This helps create better character development and interaction between them. The werewolves themselves could have been better with a larger budget but it doesn't really take away from the story. Overall, if this had been a larger budget film made for cinema and with a couple of minor adjustments, the story itself was good enough to have been a solid 4 star movie worth paying $15 to see in the theatres.",1485561600,,1748,4.317073170731708
7436844,4,B015H66J56,"This is a little atmospheric gem of a horror film. It brings the scares, but also a style and sensibility that is all its own. It might not be heavy duty enough for hardcore horror fans, but it is DEFINITELY worth a watch.",1485302400,,222,4.186046511627907

I will at the end of this review explain why I went for 4 stars and not 5. the story is about a group of passengers on a late train and none of them very likable at all and the train stops mysteriously in a little known area that has a reputation. The conductor goes missing trying to find the problem and the passengers decide to walk to the nearest station, they hear sounds and growling and find the conductors body....run back to the train and try to fortify the train. One by one things happen and you have the typical characters, the tough girl, the old couple, the fat guy, the coward etc. the hero is the ticket collector. it is a lot of fun and well worth seeing. The loss of one star is for the fact that  I liked and didn't like the end. The first ending is the usual guy gives his life to save the girl (hate that) the second ending well, I won't tell that one.",1465776000,9,921,4.088397790055248

7436892,4,B015H66J56,"I saw the trailet for this movie and I couldn't wait to see it in its full length form. The story is pretty simple. A red eye train breaks down in the middle of the forest in a dead zone, and when the passengers try to make their way to a nearby - nearby as in a couple to a few miles away through a forest, devoid of almost all local wildlife, at night with next to zero lighting but the moon and a single flashlight - train station, they find themselves under attack by a hungry, and apparently ticked off, pack of werewolves. Despite its simplicity, the film kept me interested.

It's been a while, a long while, since I saw a good werewolf movie. I think the last one I saw was ""Dog Soldiers"". I was beginning to think they no longer existed. In addition, this is an indie horror movie, and which kind of places it in the wild card category. There's no back story to the werewolves existence, but it's mentioned that this is not the first time a train has broken down in the woods at night on a full moon. Their existence seems mostly biological despite their traditionally supernatural origins.

The werewolves are vastly different from the ones you usually see on film. They're big, largely hairless save for some short, fine hairs on the legs, and they lack tails. They're basically human from the waist up but have the teeth, ears, legs, and eyes of wolves. Sort of like they never fully made the transformation, but it's definitely an effective design. They're nearly human but still aggressively animalistic. They definitely made me feel uneasy when I saw one of the first werewolves debut. I would not even want to encounter them in a dark alley. As a makeup artist, I basically orgasmed over the design, which is a combination of Special FX makeup and CGI. The werewolves are also able to claw through metal, in some instances, and climb trees. In all the books I've read and movies I've seen, werewolves have never climbed trees. It's very unsettling. You are basically screwed either way with these bad boys.

My complaints about this movie are that the werewolves are revealed too late. I feel the dialogue, most of which is just a step above Jibberish, took up too much time that could have been dedicated to some good werewolf action. When we do see the werewolves, as nasty, creepy, menacing, and scary as they are, when we do see them all the action seems kind of rushed. They're only fully given their time in the last thirty minutes of the film.

The film is also dark. Dark as in the lighting is not very good. It might be because I watched this movie on TV, on the Chiller channel, or the fact that it's a B-movie. My eyes struggled to see a lot of the outdoor shots, even though I watched this movie in a pitch black, light-deprived room.

Most of the characters are very unlikable. Pretty much the only characters I rooted for were Joe, Ellen, Billy, Matthew, and Paul. Even the driver, but that was mostly because he was played by Sean Pertwee, who also starred in ""Dog Soldiers"". All the other characters I could not wait to see die, but when they did die I was completely indifferent. There's no romance, nudity or sex, but there's a lot of attention paid to relationships past, current, negative, and positive, mostly the relationships between men and women. On a positive note, the characters are all relatable. They're all everyday characters, people you see or may know. I guess that's also why I wasn't disappointed when a good portion of them died. This movie kind of played out one of my fantasties of off'ing all the people who annoy me. Although I did like that most of them didn't want to die, but I hated that some classic horror film clichs were pulled. Example, if you tie up the jerk, don't untie him. Just leave him to be killed.

The ending was okay. It had me nodding my approval, but it also annoyed me a little and left me wanting more. All that aside, this has become one of my new favorite films. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys horror films, or at least werewolf films.",1465084800,,4025,4.48431105047749

In short: It does go very slow at beginning and middle and all of the characters are UNLIKEABLE. You want all of them to die right off! So that's not good. Even the MC is weak and not endearing in any way. There are some cool creature effects. So if you are someone that's only criteria in a movie is special effects and blood then yeah, get this film. However, if you like a story, someone other than DEATH to root for, then you should pass. It wasn't the worst film I've ever seen, but overall wasn't worth my time. I thought the concept of a train and werewolves was awesome. Expecting something maybe like MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS meets WEREWOLVES.  Well....NO! Silly me!

7436914,5,B015H66J56,"I gave this movie 5 stars based upon the credibility of the story as far as the genre is concerned as well as the excellent acting, With echoes of Terror Train (from 1980 with Jamie Lee Curtis) and a specific scene from the first Underworld (from 2005 with Kate Beckinsale), we have a group of late night travellers on a British train suddenly brought to a halt and stuck in a desolated area with a dense forest along one side. How will the passengers deal with each other? How will they deal with an outside threat that slowly but surely moves upon them as they remain stranded and imprisoned within the confines of the detained train? What exactly is the threat? Can they withstand it or counter it in some way? As usual, unexpected heroes and villains emerge in a film of this kind. Ed Speelers is outstanding as a young guard who unexpectedly rises to the occasion. He wasn't even supposed to be on this shift originally. Another surprise is a young man played by Sam Gittins who has guts and some helpful technical skills. A couple of the young ladies are no slouches either. But is it enough? The passengers display a considerable amount of defiance and ingenuity once the threat becomes more imminent. However, a greater danger is pure human nature and the selfish need to survive regardless of the cost. Sean Pertwee (most recently the ""butler"" in the TV show GOTHAM) in what amounts to an almost cameo role plays the part of the train's engineer. A mix of both genders and various ages
comprises the motley crew that must defend itself in this uncompromising battle. There are a couple of glaring ""loopholes"" that have to do with distances travelled and particular technical issues. Certain situations are also a bit contrived and implausible but this is, after all, a
horror/SciFi movie. On the whole, it will keep you on the edge of your seat or bed. Keep a drink and a bag of popcorn handy.",1460851200,5,1902,4.613569321533923

7436918,2,B015H66J56,"What a waste of Sean Pertwee.

The worst aspect of this film is the hypocrisy.  On one hand, you have werewolves.  Powerful, deadly man-beasts who exemplify natural selection in their dealings with poorly armed human beings.  Only the strongest survive, so naturally, we would expect them to be as adept at killing as they are.  On the other hand, there's some moral lesson amongst the train passengers about the benefits of being a nice guy, even though the phrase ""nice guys finish last"" isn't just a phrase.

The one passenger who should have had the best chance of surviving is the one passenger who would have hobbled his own mother to put a limping morsel between himself and a pursuing werewolf.  But as movies tend to do, this one made it a point to make sure he got his comeuppance in the end.  Really?  In a movie with a premise that relies on humans surviving against something supernatural, you can't even manage to get the basic laws of nature right?",1460160000,2,963,4.617647058823529

This is what you get when a special effects, creature designer (Paul Hyett) tries his hand at directing.  The plot is pretty standard.  So much time is spent (some would say wasted) on introducing the bodies/characters, most are unpleasant and barely worth puppy chow.  They fight among themselves before having to deal with the werewolves.  The big reveal of the unconventionally designed werewolves comes very late in the movie.

7436956,4,B015H66J56,"Tonights feature is our first request, and one of my favorite monsters, but also the one that makes me the most nervous. The Werewolf. Every correctly done werewolf movie is a cinematic piece of art, but the problem is that for every one that's done right, there are 50 that are centered around some guy in a rubber mask, and people running from a shaky camera. Fortunately,  this one gets it mostly right.
Joe (Ed Speleers) is having a bad day. He gets passed up on a promotion, and the guy that is supposed to take over at the end of his shift doesn't show up, so he gets stuck working the last train out of London. As Joe works his way through the train, anyone thats ever had a s***ty job where they are under appreciated and tormented by the clientele will instantly identify with him. Other members of the staff treat him like an idiot, the woman he's attracted to blows him off, and the passengers on the train clearly have no respect for him at all. It's not until the train hits an animal, and the driver steps outside, that the full realization of how bad things really are begins to set in. It doesn't take long, and once it starts, it goes hard.
The Werewolf is a easy sell and a hard sell at the same time. It tickles that primitive fear of being stalked by a wild animal with no chance of reasoning or compassion, but it also requires a sense of claustrophobia to really make it set in. The setting of a train that is stuck in the middle of a forest provides a perfect atmosphere to amplify this fear. Statistically,  there is no scarier monster in movie history (in my ever so humble opinion), and being stuck in an inescapable situation surrounded by these beasts is a fear that goes back to the dawn of man. Adding to this is that every person bitten but not killed becomes a werewolf themselves, adding a fair dash of paranoia and sadness to the film. Most importantly, the film never stops being fun to watch, and the ending is another classic.
Scare Factor 6/10 As I said earlier, it's a scary premise, but the movie never moves into the horrifying territory. Nothing here will keep you up at night, and it's not going to affect you in a bad way. My only problem with the movie is the design of the werewolves. I prefer a more animalistic creature, and from the waist up, these look too much like men for me. Not that the design is bad, just not my choice. However, for the most part, the creatures are mostly hidden in darkness, so it doesn't affect it that much.
I have definitely seen much worse.
Gore 5/10 There is blood, and wounds, but it's not an extreme amount. As compared to a few other wolf movies I've seen, it's relatively tame. This isn't a bad thing. Keeping the movie grounded in reality instead of everyone gushing buckets of blood helps add to the scare factor.
Acting 10/10 This is the true strength of a werewolf movie, seeing as how the monsters mostly just lurk and kill. I like to think of them as the opposite of a slasher film cast. Instead of being cookie cutter, death fodder, you have to care a bit about the characters in the film. This movie hits all of the right spots, and does it perfectly. Even the actors playing people that you aren't supposed to like do it in a way that is not only extremely realistic, but actually familier to most of us. It is all too easy to become a caricature of an actual person, and this movie avoids that completely.
Recommended 8/10 While not the best I've ever seen, this is a fun and very enjoyable movie. It's only 92 minutes long, so it never drags, and even the slow moments are accented by a tension of waiting for something bad to happen. Even if it doesn't become part of your collection, every horror fan should see this.",1456876800,,3714,4.365606936416185

It's just poor writing (and ultimately frustrating to watch). Anyone expecting to see Sean Pertwee, be warned, he's in the movie for all of 3 minutes and says maybe 5 words.

7437010,2,B015H66J56,"""Howl"" was originally supposed to receive nationwide release.  When I discovered this on On-Demand, I knew something horrible had gone wrong.  My prediction did not miss by much.

First of all, let me say my favorite kind of ""horror"" is werewolves.  They do not try and seduce anyone; it is all about man's Id and our own ""demon within.""  I looked forward to watching the latest in this genre.  The movie starts off innocently enough.  In a torrential downpour, a train leaves a station in London bound for various parts.  Along the way, mechanical trouble (of some sort) is experienced.  The conductor gets out to check what has happened.  It has now stopped raining and a full moon can be clearly seen.  Somewhere in the forest, a howl is heard.  This is when the fun SHOULD start.  Well.....

I had two major problems with this movie.  First, none of the passengers on this train were likable.  They all looked (and acted) as if someone was holding a small piece of dog glitch under their noses.  Ill-mannered, ill-tempered, and just plain boorish I felt sorry for the ticket taker (Joe).  He held his temper much better than I would have held mine.  Second, the werewolf makeup was an absolute disaster.  I have seen much better efforts on SyFy's ""Face Off.""  If the makeup artist(s) wanted to go werewolf hybrid, that's fine.  Just please make it so the audience KNOWS they're not looking at a body suit!  The acting, on the other hand, was very good.

There was a lot of potential in ""Howl"" and some of that potential was reached.  However, once the ""beast"" was revealed, it was all downhill for me.  Rated ""R"" for violence and disturbing images.",1454544000,,1652,4.649305555555555

I haven't seen a Werewolf film AS good in many of my, passed, 67-years. I am a rather large man, myself, as you
can see from my attached photo. I thought I was TOO tall to be a wolf man, but the ""lead-wolf"" in THIS movie ap-
pears to be about MY size. I paid a boot maker GOOD money to make my Frankenstein boots lift me up to 6'11""...
The story (95% in/outside a three-car train) is about a train conductor and a handful of---often---obnoxious passen-
gers that get stuck in the middle of a ""Black"" Forest when their train breaks down after hitting a very large deer.
The plot-line is average but with a very scary, possibility... WITH several werewolves. ""Well done!"" to first-time
director Paul Hyett. A replica of a three-car train was made from WOOD---watch the making-of featurette!---in which
you can watch as it is pulled apart inside a large warehouse [with a man-made forest] when the shoot was over.
The werewolves are alarmingly real-life characters, and, s-c-a-r-y.
The first 15-minutes of the film is prepatory to getting into the conductor's mind-set. He's a meek man that finds an Ego.
His life will be changed, forever.",1453852800,6,1585,4.917910447761194

However, when you get a full view of these beasts the horrible creature designs, their behaviors, and the idiotic behavior of the train passengers completely ruins the effect and all you can think about is the money you just wasted.

A few of the characters' deaths were predictable. You didn't have to be a mind reader to realize who was going to bite it. The effects while decent, could have been better. My major gripe is that I needed subtitles to understand some of the things that the actors stated. Some of the accents were a bit thick for my yankee self, so I needed to watch it with the subtitles. Regardless, I'm definitely glad that I saw this. The movie left plenty of opportunity for a sequel or even a prequel. I for one, wouldn't mind seeing the events that happened in the 60's, and the aftermath of this movie. I think it would be a very good idea to expand on it.

7437103,2,B015H66J56,"I don't like horror movies in general and I also don't care much for all the zombie movies that are now so popular. But I am fond of an occasional werewolf movie. I think it was 987 when we had the Golden Age of werewolf films. There was 'An American Werewolf in London' , 'The Howling' and 'Wolfen'. All three were major big budget Hollywood releases.

So remembering back then I rented this movie, hoping that it made sense and had some ideas to contribute to the werewolf canon, The film starts off well enough with attractive young British players establishing a plot premise. I won't spoil this on the off chance that someone actually reads this review Suffice it to say that when the werewolves appear- things get worse for the viewer. It started well but became a disappointment in the last reels. Pity,

The main problem for me was that the werewolves were so improbable. They were large and numerous and were supposed to live in a woods near a number of British towns. They had been their for decades yet no one on the train had heard of them except one older guy. This I'm afraid won't do.  In the three werewolf films I mentioned there presence in the modern world is made much more plausible.

BTW my personal theory of the werewolf legend is the presence of Serial Killers. A medieval community that harbored a serial killer would not understand what was going on. They would known all of their neighbors but couldn't account for the occasional very violent death of one of their townspeople. They knew that the murderer had to be some ordinary citizen whom they knew.

Serial killers were hard to spot until there were modern police systems. The superstitious peoples before modern times thought that the hidden killers among them periodically became beasts.",1453507200,,1772,4.684887459807074

7437109,4,B015H66J56,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

I grew up as a child hiding behind the couch whenever Lon Chaney Jr. began to change into the wolf man. I don't know why but for me that was a terrifying image as a child. As I grew older the werewolf movie became one of my favorites in the horror genre. While others loved AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON I was singing the praises of THE HOWLING. Many hated THE WOLFMAN with Benicio Del Toro I thought it was a nice homage to all the films that came before it. Im a huge fan of DOG SOLDIERS. So when I heard there was a new werewolf movie being released I was ready, willing and able. Its nice to know I wasn't disappointed.

The story revolves around a passenger train in England that is making a night trek to various stops in the countryside. The conductor on this passage is Joe, a young man with little to look forward to and performing his duties with little enthusiasm. Belittled by his boss he does what is required and little more. He does have an eye for another employee on the train, Ellen, but even that doesnt appear to have any hope of turning into anything. Once he takes tickets, Joe sets down for a short nap but that is interrupted when the train comes to a screeching halt. It appears something has happened to stop the train and the driver is going to check and see what was on the tracks.

Within moments the driver is attacked and killed by something and the train passengers are left to complain and become agitated because they want nothing more than to get home. When Joe and Ellen cant give them the answers they want or tell them where the driver is they begin to make decisions on their own. Led by a blustery businessman they force Joe to open the door and then head down the tracks to the nearest town 2 miles away. As they make their trek Joe and Ellen come upon the disemboweled body of the driver and tell the passengers to head back to the train immediately. They do so to the howls of a nearby wolf and almost all make it in with the exception of an older woman whose leg is caught in the door. That turns into a battle for her body as she is lifted up and down from something outside until they finally get her in, her leg a mangled mess.

Still having no idea what they are up against the passengers begin to turn on one another first and then on Joe and Ellen. With the train disabled they have nowhere to go and rather than sit helpless their focus becomes on of nothing but their complaints until the husband of the elderly woman tells them to shut up. Rather than argue with one another they begin to try and figure out just what to do. When a cell phone begins ringing, the only phone to get reception, rather than be calm they all rush the young girl with the phone who is then pulled from the train as the first seen werewolf breaks through a window to take her.

Now knowing what they face, or denying it depending on the person, they just work together to survive. As the film progresses we get to know each of them as a person rather than a mob. We get glimpses into who can be trusted and who might be questionable. And before the night is through we finally get to see the werewolves in all their beastly glory walking along the train or trying to get to the passengers. It gives the term meals on wheels a whole new meaning.

The movie works on so many levels. The interaction between the members of the train is first and foremost as various passengers and employees try to vie for control of the group. The claustrophobia of the compartmentalized train that holds little safety and offers the sense of their surrounding squeezing in around them takes on a personality of its own. And the sheer horror of a stranded group trying to survive the night while under attack from a much stronger assailant makes for a terrifying concept.

It all comes together quite nicely in this film that I have little doubt played in few theaters which is a shame. Having seen some of the horror films that have actually made it to theaters I can tell you that this one is much better than a number of those. It was one of those movies where while the remote was nearby I never once found myself wanting to fast forward at any time while the movie played. With many unknown horror films thats something rare these days. This film didn't feel like there was filler. It felt like each component was there for a reason and they all worked.

The performances were well done by all. There are some characters you feel for and others you wish would get killed first instead of later. None can be singled out as best. What can be said is that Sean Pertwee as the driver felt wasted here. Im a fan of Pertwee (who was in the fantastic werewolf film DOG SOLDIERS) and wished we would have had more of him here.

One of the telling factors in any werewolf movie though is the werewolf itself. In this case theyve done a great job with what I would have to assume was a small budget. Not only were the sequences with the actor in make-up done well the later scenes of the werewolves outside of the train using CGI to give them the wolf haunches was done excellently as well.

Ive seen some reviews of this that weren't too favorable and Im left wondering why. While it might not be the greatest movie ever made or even compare to DOG SOLDIERS or THE HOWLING, it is well made, interesting and a nice addition to the genre. I think this is one that I can watch again and for me that raises it above many highly praised horror films. This one was a treat.",1453334400,,5531,4.289272030651341

7437111,3,B015H66J56,"Here again I'm looking for new horror flicks. The production quality is pretty good and acting as well. It wasn't too terribly original and not the strongest script. But if you need something new to watch, this one is okay.",1453248000,,223,4.6
7437112,5,B015H66J56,"Very nice take on the werewolf genre.  A train full of cranky, quirky people trapped in the middle of nowhere.  Which happens to be werewolf territory.  There is a nice slow build up to the crux of the situation they all find themselves in.  We really get a feel for most of the characters and who we should hate and who we should feel bad about getting eaten.

Excellent performances.  Great actors.  The effects were pretty great too.  Up close the werewolves are scary.  From far away, they are extremely frightening.  You'll see.  This film captures the terror of seeing a werewolf lingering or lurking about in the woods at night!

I also enjoy that the werewolves are not invincible.  They are terrible beasts, but a group of well-organized humans has a chance.  Sort of.  Maybe.

Howl kept my attention all the way through.  It ramps up the tension well, changing pace perfectly throughout.  It transforms from a story about a sad train guard and his boring job into a truly frightening encounter with evil.  Which has a twist ending some might like.

I bought it.  Will watch again.  HOWL rocks.",1453161600,8,1103,4.664921465968586

But, unfortunately, the writers have worked exclusively with children television programs, and it shows. This is so poorly executed with clich after clich. Yes, a werewolf chases them, dies, and returns to human form. Yet, there's a ""there's no such thing as..."" scene, that no one would be arguing in this situation. It's filled with one dimensional expendable characters. The old woman werewolf is almost humorous, how she just flails towards people. The ending makes zero sense, there was no reason for any of that to happen. To me, it fails on almost every level. But, it's a well shot movie, and that alone gets it two stars. Wait for this on Netflix. It's nowhere near the top of werewolf movies out there.",1453075200,,833,4.673469387755102

I personally loved this movie and I haven't seen a Werewolf film this good since my favorite Werewolf movie ""Dog Soldiers"" released back in 2002. I will now start with the story which is about a train conductor named Joe and a handful of relatable and sometimes very obnoxious passengers that get stuck in the middle of Thornton Forest when their train breaks down. The story is very average but with a very frighteningly plausible scenario minus the Werewolves lol. I will now move onto the acting which was very well done being as how I didn't know anyone except Sean Pertwee who is mainly a cameo which disappointed me but it is all good. I will now move onto the action which was Superbly done especially with the gore and the visceral kills. I mean I was caught off guard one or two times which is rare for me so that is a testament to this film. I will now move onto the cinematography slash visual effects. I mean bravo to the director Paul Hyett this is the first film I have seen of his out of his two the other of which is on Netflix which I plan to watch but he knows his stuff. I mean the fact that it's shot on a train and the outskirts of a forest and it can still keep you invested is quite audacious. I looked up his credentials and his main work is with make-up art and prosthetic work and it is very evident. The werewolves are very real and alarmingly scary. The location was chosen perfectly being shot in London of course. I will close this review by saying that this is a Must-Watch movie in my opinion. I will say the movie starts off a bit slow for the first 20 to 25 minutes but if you can get past the story building as little as there may be then this is a true Werewolf Gem of a movie.",1452988800,2,1808,4.1833810888252145

7437123,2,B015H66J56,"Finally got to see this excellent werewolf movie. Fans of the howling and dog soldiers will love this gory romp. That aside, I must comment on the blu ray itself. The packaging is flimsy and cheap. The most important complaint is the authoring of the disc. I don't know if it's a defective batch that was received from the store I bought it from, but the orginal disc I purchased plus the replacement i went and exchanged for both had an extremely faulty sound issue. In the beginning of the film there's a scene where the main character falls asleep and the sound becomes very static and then completely cuts out three times. I thought it might just be that particular disc, but like I said, it was also the same problem on the exchanged disc and at that specific scene. The store cannot refund my money because the product is open, they can only exchange it for another copy. I strongly feel that if I were to exchange it for a third copy, It most likely have the same issue. I'm going to contact the manufacturer and pursue a refund through them. Don't let the product review deter you from seeing the movie, it's excellent. I'm just extremely disappointed because i've been waiting months to see this movie only to receive an inferior product.",1452988800,,1247,4.546666666666667

7437132,1,B015H66J56,"Please do not be taken-in by any positive reviews for this movie. I'm afraid you'll only end up as disappointed and annoyed as I am after barely being able to get through this failure of a film. I love a good werewolf story, and you could probably consider me to be picky about the movies and TV series I deem worthy of celebration regarding this genre of horror. ""Howl"" will never be considered as such! Trust me, as far as this subject goes, you could do a whole lot better to get your werewolf fix rather than view this appallingly silly offering. Normally I like to go in depth with my reviews whether I enjoyed the movie or not. However, the shear litany of problems this movie contains would make writing a review less than the length of a two-page essay a daunting task indeed.

What I will say is that ""Howl"" starts off with a certain amount of promise. I mean, you clearly understand at the outset that this is a low-budget, indie horror flick; there are no two ways about it. Even still, I found the early creepy atmosphere created to be immersive enough to keep me wanting to watch. And of course you are introduced to the mixed-bag group of your typical characters found in such indie-horror-fare -- all of this is acceptable up to a certain point. Then...the wheels just come screeching and sliding off the tracks, so to speak. After the initial attack there is a slight lull in the action, and at this point in the movie things just become dumb and dumber.

It's almost as if the filmmakers deliberately wanted to just give the viewer a great big middle-finger, thereby completely sabotaging all the real creepy atmosphere they carefully and thoughtfully crafted during the first third of the film. Nearly every single one of the actors in the movie suddenly became the worst kind of people you could possibly be stuck on a train with! This annoyed me so much, because I was really hoping this was going to be a real creepy, scary werewolf movie I could view over and over again. I know there is a good amount of disbelief that must be suspended to enjoy most films, especially horror. But you simply cannot force your mind to accept completely asinine and ludicrous ideas and scenarios that greatly mock commonsense and offend reason. At this point the filmmakers are either showing how much they lack in creativity and imagination, or they're just lazy; thumbing their noses at the audience by not following through with what they've started (i.e. furthering a mood and atmosphere that imparted a compelling sense of danger and dread to the viewer). Why give up on such a carefully measured tone that is successfully established in the beginning? One that really lends a macabre weightiness that is essential to all horror movies. Very Tacky!

The ""werewolves"" themselves became ridiculous and less menacing and scary as the film moved along. This is partly because, in my opinion, they showed them way too often once the action really commences from that ""lull"" that I mentioned before. The other reason is apparently due to what I can only describe as a series of poor choices made in the writing/script. Without giving anything away, there were some puzzling conceptual designs about the werewolves' origin, appearance, and behavior that made no sense -- some of which were downright laughable. You'll understand what I mean if you decide to watch for yourselves.

So as I said at the beginning, there was some hope and genuine anticipation that this would be at least a decent to good werewolf flick, but I dared to hope too soon...And ultimately in vain! I would recommend waiting for this to either be free on Prime or at least cheaper to rent. I actually wish I could persuade Amazon to furnish me a refund -- that would ease some of the annoyance I feel as a result of thinking ""Howl"" was as good as the trailer and positive reviews make it seem. I hope this review helps someone else to avoid wasting their time and money on this major disappointment.",1452816000,13,3976,4.675714285714286
7437133,4,B015H66J56,"I was quite surprise that the movie ""Howel"" turned out to be a good thriller slasher, with a few jumps here and there. The only con, I have is that the half wolf/man should look more realistic like the ones from the hit movie ""Underworld"".  Overall good movie I hope to see a second movie even better then the first.

7437135,3,B015H66J56,"I enjoyed it while it was; the person I watched it with turned it off and said, ""Oh my God, what a horrible movie!""

Sort of a toss up then. The acting was good in parts and pretty bad in others. The ""werewolves"" aren't really werewolves; werewolves don't walk in sunlight and can only turn on the full moon so that was disappointing; the premise was silly as well. If there was a pack of man eating Not-Werewolves who are smart enough to make trains derail and run around in the woods eating people since the 60's, you'd think someone would have noticed and killed them off. The usual idiocy of horror movie characters who do things like, oh, wander off into the woods to get eaten without even telling the person he's supposed to be guarding that he's leaving. If you can suspend disbelief for a few hours, you might enjoy this.",1452643200,2,830,4.42483660130719

Not bad. A odd bit of film that takes a stab at some character development in the beginning, but the characters are so repulsive that we never really care much about anyone except the lead and his co-worker love interest. It takes some time to get going, but the setting is pretty eerie and you get just a touch of An American Werewolf in London vibe, but it's nowhere even close to that epic movie. It never really says what brings the train to a sudden halt, but I'm pretty sure a train would run right over a deer carcass . The creatures I think are supposed to be werewolves, but they come off more as some sort of werewolf/witch hybrid for lack of a better term, I'll just call them Werewitches. The beat down they give the first Werewitch came off as kind of funny, although I'm not sure if it was meant to. One guy claims to have some engineering knowledge, but I don't think you can fix a broken train with duct tape and a pipe wrench. The lookout of course does what you expect, and tropes off into the woods after a sound he hears and gets shredded and not the good kind of shredded. It was satisfying to see the annoying scrunchy faced blonde woman get booted out of the train. Some others die here and there, and the main character unnecessarily plays white knight and sacrifices himself when he should have just kept running. The jackass of the film gets what's coming to him in the end. Overall worth at least one watch...probably.",1530403200,,1456,4.396296296296296
