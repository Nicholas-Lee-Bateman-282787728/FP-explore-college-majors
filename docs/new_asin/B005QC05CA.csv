8483164,1,B005QC05CA,This DVD has froze several times and ten mintues into a scene (depending on length) freezes time and time again.  I have contacted the vendor 2x and so far just Crickets!!!! They have not contacted me about a refund.  The other thing I noticed is that the resolution changes throughout the viewing....If you try to get get past a scene that is frozen it may or may not go to the next scene.  As of the writing of this review they still have not contacted me...I would stay clear of the this vendor and Amazon needs to drop them.  THIS MUST BE A BAD BOOTLEG COPY,1374105600,3,561,4.264150943396227

Hopefully, it will be available soon to enjoy.
