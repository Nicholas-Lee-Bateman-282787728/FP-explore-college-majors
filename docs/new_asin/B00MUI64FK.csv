8674688,5,B00MUI64FK,"As soon as I received the movies I saw many 1 star reviews saying these movies were not in 3D and I tested them right away to see if it was true so I would not waste any time returning them.

Both movies can be played in 2D and 3D. When you select ""play movie"" it automatically gives you the option to play in 2 or 3D. I'm wondering if those people were playing them in compatible TVs/players. These played perfectly using my PS3 and a Sony 3D TV.

Maybe the product quality varies and they were unlucky by getting faulty items. All is possible. However, mine worked as expected.",1472083200,,579,4.254545454545455
8674689,4,B00MUI64FK,"You must see this in 3D it is excellent, I really enjoy watching these two movies on one disc it saves room in storage as well, a great idea. the movies are very good in quality and the stories are so much fun always a laugh.",1463011200,,225,3.9130434782608696

You get your choice of 2D or 3D after the ""Play"" is selected. I suggest the 3D.",1452902400,,229,4.111111111111111

8674692,5,B00MUI64FK,"Not real sure what problems the other buyers were having, but to be absolutely clear THESE MOVIES ARE IN 3D.  Case contains 2 discs, one for each film.  Each movie is playable as either 2D or 3D, perhaps the other buyers didn't notice the choice on the main menu.

These are fun, colorful movies.  I saw the first two in the theater, this was my first viewing of the more recent entries to the franchise.  Very enjoyable, both with some nice ""pop out"" visual moments.

Pricing on this double-bill is hard to beat.  3D aficionados can purchase this set with confidence.",1430265600,5,568,4.564356435643564
