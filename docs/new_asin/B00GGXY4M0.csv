8623030,5,B00GGXY4M0,"Howdy;

This is a very good collection to own.  It covers all 50 states plus the District of Columbia.  Each program is about 50 minutes on average.  The collection is on 12 DVD discs and are presented on alphabetical order.  The programs are stunning on a Blu-ray player & HDTV, but much better on a Blu-ray 4k up-scaling player & 4k UHDTV.  It is like looking through a window...  ...WITHOUT THE GLASS!

In addition to the 12 disc set, a bonus DVD is included of ""Over America"", narrated by Tom Skerritt.  This version is about 25 minutes longer than the Blu-ray high definition version.

I recommend this set to anyone that loves to sight-see, but just can't do it or use it to get ideas of where to go and what to see.

Happy viewing...",1444953600,,740,4.407407407407407
