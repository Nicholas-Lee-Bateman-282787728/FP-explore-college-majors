4897330,5,B005VOIXLS,"As The World Turns, the second longest running soap opera in history, is definitely a classic. It was a terrible shame to see it cancelled (along with the longest running soap, Guiding Light in 2009), but now I have the opportunity to relieve some of the classic moments in the show's history that have never been released to the public before. This is an absolutely fabulous idea that I hope will be able to set a trend for other soaps as well. I would particular love to see some classic Days of our Lives episodes: Doug/Julie's romance, the beginnings of the show, and the Laura/Bill/Mickey triangle. I would also be thrilled to see some classic All My Children episodes as well. It would be a nice treat to the fans to be able to own a set of their favorite soap after seeing it cancelled this past September. The old tapes are just sitting in the network studios when they could be making a profit for the companies that produce them. Why aren't they jumping the gun on this? Haha. Please release some more soaps on DVD! I will pay good money for them.

4897331,5,B005VOIXLS,"For several years, I kept thinking that soaps should come out with ""Best of"" packages.  I never thought that the first one would be THE show that I loved the most.  Despite the fact that ""As the World Turns"" has been off the air for over a year now, ATWT is one of classic shows of the genre and did not deserve to be forgotten.  Thanks to this wonderful set, it won't be.  The good news?  These are not homemade DVDs taken from old VHS tapes.  These are crystal clear, perfect quality episodes taken from the original source.  And what a selection.  Sad that you didn't discover the show until long after Lily found out her true maternity?  Now you can see it!  What about the famous 30th anniversary episode?  Here it is.  Want proof that Julianne Moore, Meg Ryan and Marisa Tomei were on it?  Here you go.  This collection is a treasure chest.  And hey, there were over 13,000 episodes to choose from and here are some real gems.  if you loved ATWT and would maybe like to see more, run out and get this and return to Oakdale.  It is worth it and it's priced to buy. You cannot pass this up.",1319068800,24,1094,4.258536585365854

4897334,5,B005VOIXLS,"I just want to express how grateful I am to have a chance to see these wonderful episodes again! I grew up with these characters and watched ATWT until the end. I don't know if I have really reconciled that the show is off the air. I prefer to think that it's just on hiatus. Hopefully, there will be more of episodes released. I really think I could watch ATWT all over again--that's how much a part of my life the show was to me",1325376000,2,430,4.070588235294117
4897335,5,B005VOIXLS,"Procter and Gamble Productions and Broadway Home Video struck paydirt with this collection of 20 episodes.  Each one is a gem and it brought me back to the reason why I loved this show when it was on the air.

Going back to 1979 and nearly to the show's final airdate, these episodes capture life in Oakdale as it was seen through loyal fans and viewers.  What was most interesting that on one of the episodes, the sponsors were left intact as was the closing announcements.

But that is minor to the treat that's in store for anyone who wanted to watch this show, but was nervous or thought it was boring - 54 years is a lot to mine nuggets out of and this collection is worth the money.",1324425600,,688,4.269230769230769
4897336,5,B005VOIXLS,It brought back lots of memories of afternoons with  my mother & grandmother who are both now gone.  Thanks for rescuing a little of the old classics.,1323475200,4,150,4.518518518518518
4897337,5,B005VOIXLS,"I just ordered this set online. I was just about to order the ""last one"" offered by Amazon when someone else snatched it before I did. Lucky me!! I googled it and purchased it directly from s o a p c l a s s i c s . c o m and used the promo code ATWTXMAS for 10% off. The total was $17.95 with free shipping.

I am sorry this isn't really a review, but I figured it might be helpful for those interested in this set. I will review it here after I receive it and will adjust the star-rating if needed.

Addendum added 12/26/2011: I received the set about 2 weeks after I ordered it. My mom was still visiting and really enjoyed watching some of these classic episodes with me. Some of the characters and storylines have faded from our memories while others seem like just yesterday. We really enjoyed seeing the veteran players back when they were younger and more involved in the plots. It is worth getting if you are a fan and warrants 5+ stars!

Addendum added 02/26/2012: I just got an email from s o a p c l a s s i c s . c o m with another promo code. You can get 15% off ""this week only"" using Winter15. This works for the ATWT and GL Classics as well as ATWT X-mas and GL Riva sets.",1323388800,4,1189,3.9665271966527196
4897338,5,B005VOIXLS,"This was such a great blast from the past.  I had to force myself to stop watching.  It was like watching old home movies of my own family.  If you grew up on As The World Turns like I did, this is a MUST HAVE!",1323302400,3,210,3.6222222222222222
4897339,5,B005VOIXLS,"After CBS cancelled ""As the World Turns"" in 2010 fans were left in an uproar. Not only was one of the most popular daytime serials axed for yet another talk show, but the amount of daily network dramas fell down to six (now there are only four!). Thankfully, someone at Proctor and Gamble (""As the World Turns""' production company) decided to put 20 complete, uncut episodes onto DVD. ""As the World Turns"" remains the ONLY daytime soap opera to ever get a DVD release (the other being ""ABC's ""Dark Shadows"").

 In this beautiful four-disc set fans can catch episodes of the series as far back as 1979! For me not only was it nice to see some old favorite characters I hadn't seen in a long time, but it was nice to see the different openings of the show. My personal favorite was the one used from 1967-1981 that was very similar to the original black and white opening, but colored. It was great to see future movie stars like Meg Ryan and Julianne Moore, as well as characters Kim, Lisa, Bob, and Nancy along with the newer characters like Luke.

 Sales for this set have been tremendous and there is also a special Christmas DVD of ""As the World Turns"" featuring 5 classic Holiday shows so look for that.

 Talk is Proctor and Gamble is releasing similar box sets of their other serials including ""Guiding Light"", ""Another World"", ""Search for Tomorrow"", ""Texas"" and ""The Edge of Night"".

 A lot of fans have wondered why the company didn't go back further and release episodes from the 1950's to the 1970's and the reason is because Proctor and Gamble, along with the networks, destroyed all the episodes from that era. This practice was called wiping in which the networks saved money by using the videotapes of episodes and recording over them. P and G only started to keep an archive of their soap operas beginning in the fall of 1979.

 UPDATE: On January 17, 2012 ""Guiding Light"" was released on a 20 episode, 4 disc box set!",1322697600,9,1933,4.5606936416184976
4897340,5,B005VOIXLS,"Whether you absolutely love ""As the World Turns"" or just wonder what all the fuss about Proctor and Gamble Soaps is about, this DVD set provides a selection of 20 episodes from 1979 to 2010 gives you a feel for the series and the changes it went through over the decades. If you or even your parents or grandparents were fans (for decades ""As the World Turns"" was a lunch time tradition in many families), you'll find a representative episode or two from that era. While in the rush to market, they kind of shorted on the extras, it's simply amazing that they are available at all and I urge any soap fan to buy this, to ensure we get more, not just ""As the World Turns,"" but other Proctor and Gamble Soaps like ""Guiding Light,"" ""Edge of Night,"" ""Another World,"" etc. At this low price, even if you're not sure, go ahead and buy. I bought 3 sets myself, 1 to keep, and 2 to donate to library collections.",1321488000,5,904,4.323529411764706

back are beyond belief.  I hope that this is just the beginning of more and more classic soaps coming to DVD!  Just to have
that 30th anniversary episode on DVD is an incredible gift, but to have the other 19 episodes as well makes this a real
treasure chest of enjoyment.  Great job, Soap Classics ... keep em coming!!!",1320883200,14,444,4.5125

8487520,5,B005VOIXLS,"A must-have for any ATWT fan or even a soap fan with just some knowledge of Oakdale.  Disappointing that there is nothing earlier than 1979, no b&w or 30-minute eps, but still some great eps.  A little sloppy in its documentation, 2 of the eps are clearly mis-dated. Thoroughly enjoyable.",1400198400,3,288,4.74
8487521,1,B005VOIXLS,One whole track of one of the DVD's did not have any sound and I was very unhappy about that! Would not recommend this product to anyone.,1374969600,,137,4.111111111111111
8487522,5,B005VOIXLS,"For those of us who were huge ATWT fans, this helps ease the void of cancellation. This was the best soap opera on television and they picked great episodess for this. Was Awesome to see Chris Hughes and Penny again. I missed both of them terribly once they died and left the show. If you find it, BUY IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Don;t waste time if you are a true Turns fan !!!!!!!!!!",1356134400,2,377,4.309859154929577
8487523,4,B005VOIXLS,"This is a great product!  I bought it when it  first came out, with the expectation of possible online streaming of episodes, which is what the administrators of the soapclassics website basically promised was on the way to the viewers.  I just found out today that the website is shut down-- they no longer have rights to ATWT or GL , but are working on getting similar products for other shows.  This makes me think they were just out to make a buck , and lied to the viewers all along.  Very disappointing.  Just wanted to pass that on to anyone who is expecting more of these DVDs to come out.",1353369600,2,597,4.333333333333333
8487524,4,B005VOIXLS,"As a long time As The World Turns fan, it's wonderful to have these classic episodes available to purchase.  The quality is excellent.  My one complaint is that some of the music has been changed - I'm sure due to licensing restraints.  For example, at the end of the episode with Steve & Betsy's wedding, there was a version of ""their song"" played - ""Nobody Loves Me Like You Do.""  That was edited out and generic music replaces it.  In the 40th anniversary show, there was a great montage set to several different songs - again replaced with generic music.  So, that's a little disappointing.  But overall, I'm very happy with it and I hope to see more sets released.",1350864000,3,669,4.525
8487525,5,B005VOIXLS,This is a nice collection of episodes. I would love for Soap Operas to release DVD's by Seasons so you can get involved in the story lines rather than seeing selective episodes.,1346803200,,177,4.5625
