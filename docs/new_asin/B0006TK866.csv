He is now 14 taking advanced classes and doing very well in school. These are amazing products and the best babyshower gift you can give any parent. I even learned a few songs from other countrys.",1285286400,,331,4.26984126984127

8043042,5,B0006TK866,"You can see why the Waterford Institute is so highly regarded when you view these 4 tapes. My son has loved them since he was 1 when we would have to continuously get them at the library. I just purchased them and am so happy to have the whole set. Each tape is so educational and my son loves that the Letter Sounds tape does the lower case letters!

These tapes teach letter recognition, letter sounds, upper case and lower case, writing and it eases them into reading. The songs are great and the fact that they introduce so many languages is an added bonus.

I highly recommend these for early/beginning readers.",1176336000,3,616,4.491071428571429
