7965958,2,B000069HTX,"After waiting for the 1st of the Rolie Polie Olie cartoons to come to DVD, we were all so very disappointed. There was not enough of a story line for a full feature film and yet it lacked the simplistic appeal of the short cartoons we are all used to seeing. James Woods' character Gloomius looks flat (2D) and much too awkward & scary for the little ones. I expected more from William Joyce and the animation team. It's not a character you could grow to love by the end of the movie.
All in all, they did a poor job stretching a 7 minute cartoon to a 75 minute feature film.",1029369600,,575,4.142857142857143
