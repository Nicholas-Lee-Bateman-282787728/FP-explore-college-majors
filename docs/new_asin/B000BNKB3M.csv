8482955,5,B000BNKB3M,"I have viewed this DVD multiple times and absolutely love it! It contains interviews from the band and a collection of multiple videos.  This DVD is for the hard-core Def Leppard fan. A fan who collects hard-to-find memorabilia of the best band in the world. It has great quality and will not disappoint those who are seeking a unique rarity. There are other DVD's with Def Leppard footage on them, but as I said, this is for the ""fan"" that wants MORE than what is offered anywhere else.",1361145600,,487,4.534090909090909
8482956,1,B000BNKB3M,"This is actually an unlicensed bootleg, and the production quality is absolutely horrid. It's just a bunch of old interviews recorded from television.",1168473600,16,150,5.565217391304348
