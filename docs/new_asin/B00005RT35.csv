1657210,3,B00005RT35,"Billy Joel is one of the best performers of all time and this DVD presents a variety of his music videos for that reason. Unlike the past two DVD's ""Yankee Stadium"" and ""Greatest Hits III"" there are no lyrics to these videos. One thing I was dissapointed in was that for Piano Man, they decided to add the Yankee Stadium version to the DVD(which I already bought), not adding instead the original Black & White music video he made singing in a bar. I was really dissapointed there, but you can't go wrong with this DVD for all of his great songs. Lastly, considering the age of the videos some of them are not top quality but instead they give I guess a feeling of the time in when he made them.",1006387200,11,695,4.2727272727272725
1657211,4,B00005RT35,"Few DVD music video collections feature a 5.1 Dolby Digital sound mix, and the ones that do are usually just standard stereo with a little echo thrown on to the rear speaker channels. So I was shocked to find that nearly all of the tracks on ""The Billy Joel Collection"" were remixed in true 5.1 sound.
According to the DVD case, the man responsible is Thom Cadley. I have no idea who he is -- he's not a relative or a friend or a friend of a friend -- but I feel moved to give him kudos for a job well done. Some purists might not like hearing certain instruments and background vocals isolated on the rear speakers (and in one instance I was annoyed by an isolated tom overdub that should've been mixed in with the rest of the drum track), but if they don't like it, they can always choose the PCM stereo mix.
I'm not a tremendous Billy Joel fan, but I like many of his big hits and even the songs that annoy me bring back memories of the time when they were omnipresent on the airwaves. So I was a bit chagrined to find that they failed to include the video for ""We Didn't Start the Fire."" I wonder if Joel himself has grown to dislike this song.",1006300800,16,1148,4.1524663677130045
1657212,5,B00005RT35,"(...)These videos help to chronicle that career, but they also show the maturation of an artist alongside an artform. The crude early videos juxtapose with the slick look of the later ones. Take special note of the videos circa ""An Innocent Man,"" where Billy decides to go all out on the over-produced spectacle.",1005696000,,312,4.90566037735849
1657243,5,B00005RT35,"Piano Man is one of my favorite songs, and while I like the video on YouTube, the first cut on this DVD from Yankee Stadium is awesome! So here you have one of the greatest song writer and musician, his performances on the various videos shows another great talent as a showman! Out of the 24 recordings I have several other top favorites; A Matter of Trust, Baby Grand a Duet with Ray Charles, Tell Her About It, Keeping the faith and It's All Rock n Roll to me. The diversity of this collection is amazing, including Allentown about boys coming home from WW11 and Goodnight Saigon with original photos from Vietnam which is really We Were Brothers. There are some standards and some that have very good videos like Uptown Girl and She's Right on time (hilarious)! The orchestration and production are fantastic!

He was energetic and he could sing.  His early creativity stage was absolutely mind boggling.  He wrote so many great songs.  Even though most people can watch his video on YouTube, this is still a great thing for Billy Joel fans to own.  Strongly recommended.",1404518400,,423,4.648648648648648

Another bonus - the 5.1 sound is like QUEEN GREATEST VIDEO HITS - specially mixed versions that you won't ever hear anywhere else but this collection - and it's amazing.

The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack sounds great, but the first few are a little flat sounding (if you have 5.1 speakers)... understandable due to the technology at that time (probably 2 channels).
But if you love music, you will love this.
And audio vs. video? I enjoy a lot of these tracks, or maybe most, better than the audio originals... ""Uptown Girl"" for example. On that one he is working directly with the source!",1399766400,2,487,4.879518072289157

1657296,5,B00005RT35,"Billy Joel - The Essential Video Collection is one hour and forty-four minutes and was released on DVD on November 20, 2001. At first start I thought this was a live CD because it started off with a live performance of Piano Man and not the video version. The video has twenty-two songs on it and some of them like All For Leyna and Big Shot were recorded right in the studio. The one song that surprised me the most was Big Shot; I never knew Billy made a video for that song. The Essential Video Collection is missing We Didn't Start the Fire and the River of Dreams video. I would suggest you buy the Greatest Hits Volume III, but a lot of people did not give it good reviews. If you can get it on DVD, then go with Eye of the Storm with the missing songs on it. Overall this is a great DVD to add to your Billy Joel collection. Billy Joel - The Essential Video Collection gets an AAAA++++.

1657298,4,B00005RT35,"I was very excited about this video album. I have the video collections volumes 1 + 2 on VHS. I thought this would be better because of the additions. The additions were indeed great, but...what happened to the original 'Piano Man' video? It was stylish and it set the tone for the entire video album. Instead, we get a new 'Piano Man' video at Yankee Stadium. POOR CHOICE. ..I would have given this 5 stars, but cannot...",1222387200,,422,4.4935064935064934
1657299,5,B00005RT35,I bought this as a gift for a Billy Joel fan and he loved it. I enjoyed it too. Lots of nostalgia in those old MTV videos.,1219968000,,122,3.5555555555555554
1657300,5,B00005RT35,"If your're a Billy Joel fan,then this DVD is awesome,great videos of Billy Joel's greatest hits(worth it for the classic ""Keeping The Faith"" video alone!),great picture and sound quality!!! Two thumbs up!!! Way up!!! A+",1200787200,2,219,5.285714285714286

1657302,1,B00005RT35,"This DVD has my most favorite Billy Joes songs. The songs I used to listen to endlessly as a teenager and those that have so much memories associated with.

The picturization are like watching slapstick comedy. Please don't ruin your memories watching these unless you want to ruin these songs for you.",1126224000,5,302,4.8076923076923075
1657313,4,B00005RT35,If you know Billy Joel work. You will like this DVD. Maybe could have better clear image but maybe is not possible. I recommend it.,1125878400,3,131,4.28
1657314,4,B00005RT35,"I'm also a huge fan of Billy Joel (have all of his albums since I was a kid). I often tell friends, I have never been to New York, but listening to Billy takes me there! He's a bit of story teller with the talent to write catchy tunes.

I gave this DVD 4 stars because while I like all the Videos in the DVD, it's by no means a complete collection.  There are songs missing from the Storm Front and River of Dreams Albums, and some of his older stuff too. It was a surprise to see such songs as ""Los Angelenos"" and ""James"" on this collection. I like his 80's videos because they go very well with his music. Perhaps a two CD collection could have captured everything nevertheless, it's still a must have for Billy Joel fans.",1113004800,2,724,4.164285714285715
1657315,3,B00005RT35,"I reeally love a lot of great artists that have been not just influential, but artists that have such great appeal for pop music. Yet, while there are so many great acts out right now who really don't seem to have as much in influence as they did back in the 70's and 80's. For a true legend like Billy Joel, his music still keeps coming back, despite his departure from recording any well-received songs in over a decade. Still, that hasn't stopped his catalog of videos and songs from coming back with another collection of winners. Yet, when there does come to a really well put music video DVD reflection of Billy's music, it does miss the shot here.

Billy Joel: The Essential Video Collection is a well put reflection of Billy's best music videos from the 70's and 80's. The collection of songs here is very well put and remastered well. This DVD music video collection features great Billy Joel videos like Tell Her About It, the classic soulful Uptown Girl, Honesty, The Longest Time, You're Only Human (Second Wind) and other greats. Yet this music video collection does miss quite a lot when it comes to his later videos like The River Of Dreams, Lenningrad, the classic retrospective video We Didn't Start The Fire, I Go To Extremes, the dramatic video for The Downeaster Alexa, or No Man's Land.

I still think it is just a shame Billy Joel hasn't came back into the pop music scene, because his music just remains as pure classic. As for this DVD collection, I really would only suggest this, if you purchase the Greatest Hits Volume III music video collection to go with it. Otherwise, there would just be so much in videos missing.

1657316,3,B00005RT35,"This was released by the same distributor in Australia but ... it has a different cover, and some different songs to the American DVD release. We get 25 songs in total, compared to 24 on the American DVD.
The songs on the Australian DVD that are missing on the American DVD are:
- New York State Of Mind
- The River Of Dreams
- We Didn't Start The Fire
- I Go To Extremes
- Leningrad
- The Downeaster 'Alexa'
- All About Soul
The songs on the American DVD that are missing on the Australian DVD are:
- Sometimes a Fantasy
- The Night Is Still Young
- Pressure
- Keeping the Faith
- Big Shot
- Los Angelenos
It depends on which Billy Joel songs you like, but for me I would rather have the American tracks because they capture an era when Billy was at his very best. Some American reviewers wish their DVD version had ""River of Dreams"", so the answer is to import it from Australia.
I'm tempted to buy the American DVD as well but seems like a bit of overlapping just to get 6 videos not available on the Australian DVD. The real solution is for DVD producers to release one definitive DVD version including ALL tracks!
And I agree with many consumers, we want music clip videos on music DVD's not concert videos (leave concert videos for full concert DVD's).  I refer to videos like ""Piano Man"" which has been replaced with concert footage.  Urgh!",1068595200,68,1347,4.320158102766799
1657317,4,B00005RT35,"The good is that you get most of the classics. You get teh MTV videos. You get ""She's Right On Time"" and ""Goodnight Saigon"", which were left off of the Video Album released in the mid 80s. It sounds awesome, to say the least.
Now, the complaints:
""Piano Man"" should have just had the video instead of the Yankee Stadium footage.
I could have sworn Billy did a TV special in the mid-70s called ""Tonight"". This would have made a nice addition to the DVD. The promos to ""Songs in the Attic"" had to have some more footage so they could have at least put ""Captain Jack"" on there.
Other songs that should have had videos exclusive to the DVD (possibly interspersing the college lecture tours with the performances, similar to the CD box set of GH I-III): ""Scenes From an Italian Restaurant"", ""Travellin Prayer"",""NY State of Mind"", ""Prelude/Angry Young Man"", ""Just the way You Are"", ""Only the Good Die Young"", ""Movin Out"", ""Vienna"", ""She's Always A Woman"", ""Root Beer Rag"" (Which had a promo short cartoon ), ""Summer Highland Falls"", and ""Miami 2017"" (this would have been fine using the Yankee Stadium footage).
The Nylon Curtain tour was also released on home video as ""Live From Long Island"", and should be rereleased for DVD, as should the Russian concert. ""Greatest Hits III"" should have been repackaged and sold with this DVD to make it a more definitive collection.",1067299200,4,1365,4.7154811715481175
1657318,5,B00005RT35,"Having received a copy of Billy's ""Greatest Hits Volume III - The Video"" as a gift two years ago for Christmas 2000, I asked ""Santa"" for a copy of Billy's ""The Essential Video Collection"" as a gift for Christmas 2002--and I'm exceedingly glad that ""Santa"" gave me what I'd asked for!  I've been pleased with ""The Essential Video Collection"" from the first time I watched it (Christmas-mid-morning).
  The DVD is a great collection of original music videos, live concert performances and live studio performances from a legend of rock-n-roll, the ""Piano Man"".
  Although I've never been a die-hard fan of Billy (I'm a true fan of his piano-partner, Elton, instead), at the time I got into the DVD format (April of 2000) there were more Billy discs than Elton discs available (but, thankfully, that's changed within the past two years); nevertheless, I do appreciate Billy's catalog of rock music.
  Prior to experiencing ""The Essential Video Collection"", I had seen only a few of the orignal music videos on the compilation ('Pressure','Allentown','Tell Her About It','Uptown Girl'), none of the live concert footage and none of the live studio footage--so the DVD is a real treat!
  The sound quality is up to par with DVD, yet the video quality varies from song selection to song selection, especially the studio footage from the mid-to-late '70s/early '80s and the original music videos from the early-to-mid '80s, while the live concert footage is passable.
  Overall, this disc is a great Billy video release
  Still, there is one little gripe I have about the disc compilation: three of the original music videos ('Keeping The Faith','A Matter Of Trust' and 'Baby Grand' w/Ray Charles) are repeated from 1997's ""Greatest Hits Volume III - The Video""  Since the same manufacturer (Sony/Columbia Music Video) produced and released the two titles, it's displeasingly surprising to me how such a content overlap could have occurred; I mean, come on, the supply of material from which Sony/Columbia had to compile this DVD couldn't have been so low that three other *different* original music videos and/or live concert/live studio performances of three other *different* songs couldn't have selected in place of the content overlap.  Oh well, I suppose I will be thankful for the majority of the material that this DVD contains.
  In terms of DVD features, I like the interactive discography and interactive biographical timeline; also I like the audio choice: PCM stereo (which I use) and DD suround sound.  I don't really need fancy-shmancy things like subtitles, on-screen lyrics and different camera angles--pretty much a waste of disc space, if you ask me.
  All in all, ""The Essential Video Collection"" is a solid representation of Billy Joel's indelible mark on the world of rock music--a mark that he could have further perpetuated had he not turned 'classical' with ""Fantasies & Delusions"" (2001).
  In conclusion, ""The Essential Video Collection"" disc is a should-have, even for casual Billy fans, such as myself.",1041465600,18,3024,5.141104294478527
1657319,4,B00005RT35,"Billy made some of the most original videos of the 80's and they're all here.  My favorite is the ""Rube Goldbergian"" SHE'S RIGHT ON TIME.",1021939200,2,137,4.48
1657320,5,B00005RT35,"I own this video, and if you don't have it, get it! It's worth getting because of all the hits that are included in the collection. If you see it or get it, you can get more of a reaction to what Billy Joel's music is trying to talk about. All of the Glass Houses hits (All For Leyna, It's Still Rock 'n Roll to Me, You May Be Right) focuses mainly on Joel's musical ability and expression in his lyrics. Keeping the Faith, Tell Her About It, Sometimes a Fantasy, Uptown Girl, and The Longest Time create that perfect scenery for a music video, and, once again, a better look into the eyes of Billy Joel. The added videos at the end (She's Right on Time, Goodnight Saigon, Leave the Tender Moment Alone, James) put the icing on the cake, and you want to see this video again and again because it's worth watching again and again.",1010448000,3,829,4.253164556962025
1657321,5,B00005RT35,"For a Billy Joel fan, this really is an essential video collection. It contains all of the videos found in both ""Billy Joel: The Video Album, Volume I"" and ""The Video Album, Volume II."" The only difference I detected was the inclusion of the live recording of ""Piano Man"" from the Yankee stadium concert, instead of the video filmed in a piano bar used in Volume I. My favorite concept video is ""Tell Her About It,"" in which Billy is the lead singer of BJ And The Affordables performing on the Ed Sullivan show. Will Jordan does a great Ed Sullivan impersonation. Rodney Dangerfield makes a comedic cameo appearance at the beginning and end of the video. This collection also includes 4 previously unavailable videos, my favorite being the humorous ""She's Right On Time.""  In addition, there's a complete discography with a nice feature.  When you click on an album, in addition to listing all of the song titles, it plays a brief snippet of one of the songs. This collection does stop short of including the later videos found in ""Greatest Hits, Volume III: The Video.""

It has most of his hits like Uptown Girl, Piano Man, Its still rock and roll to me etc. The visuals might look jaded but that has to be the case as these songs are old and videos were shot during the 70s and 80s. This DVD is a must for Billy Joel fans.
Now, I must explain the ""but"" in review title.. those of you looking for his later videos like We didn't start the fire, River of dreams might be dissappointed. What really made me drop one star off the rating was the missing ""Shes always a woman to me"" song. That happens to be one of my favorite and I was a trifle irked to find it missing.

7952640,5,B00005RT35,The reason you should buy this is because it's the only way to see all of the Billy Joel music videos.
