8632447,2,B00A2FHX5I,"DeHavilland is one of the great actresses of the golden era.  Unfortunately between classics like Gone with the Wind and later films like To Each his Own and the Heiress, she got some bad programmers.  This is one.  Tufts might as well be called Stiffs as he is not a leading man up to DeHavilland's stature and she had to know it.  The story lacks much humor and there a plenty of other good wartime light comedies to see instead including Princess O'Rourke with DeHavilland and Robert Cummings.  She was not miscast in comedy as she has some great early roles in comedies in the late thirties.  I strongly recommend It's Love I'm After with Bette Davis and Leslie Howard and the Great Garrick with Brian Aherne.  This one is unfortunately a stinker.",1441756800,,751,4.601503759398496
8632448,3,B00A2FHX5I,"Government Girl is one of two wartime romantic comedies that Olivia de Havilland starred in, in 1943. See if you can follow: Perhaps as punishment for her ongoing show of discontent, Warner Brothers loaned de Havilland to David O. Selznick who then handed her over to RKO. This lightweight movie, produced by RKO and plagued with behind-the-scenes drama, was the final straw in de Havilland's heap of grievances against Warner Brothers as she would end up suing her home studio over her contract. It proved to be a watershed legal battle, won by her, in that it established the de Havilland Law in which studios are barred from extending to their actors contracts that go past seven years.

In Government Girl, de Havilland plays Elizabeth ""Smokey"" Allard, one of the crap ton of women trying to make do in a bustling Washington, DC, circa World War II. This was a period in time when most of the boys were away doing their part, and so the ratio of women to what's left of the men was ten to one. So, imagine the attention paid to Mr. Ed Browne (Sonny Tufts), a tall, strapping gent who apparently is big noise in the capital city. Ed is a Detroit mechanic and a sort of efficiency expert with a knack for getting things done. As such, he's called to Washington to oversee the mass production of bombers or, as I prefer to call them by their awesome nickname, flying fortresses. Ed isn't the tiptoeing kind of guy. He bellows and stomps and is impertinent and doesn't give a what if he ruffles feathers. He's in the dark when it comes to the subtleties of diplomacy. He's soon making enemies left and right.

Observes a hotel manager: ""All sorts of things happen in Washington hotel lobbies since the war started."" Ed and Smokey meet cute in a Washington hotel lobby, in a scene that hammers home how cramped and in dearth were the living accommodations during the wartime era. It's a run-in that also promptly pits our two leads against each other. Sucks for Smokey when, come to find, she's the office girl who gets assigned to the maddening Ed Browne. It's a priceless scene that allows you to take in that horrified expression that crosses Smokey's face during that big reveal. But Smokey turns out to be Ed's secret weapon. See, Smokey knows the ins and outs of Washington politics. She's networked thru and thru and comes thru like a boss when Ed inevitably lands in a big jam.

You figure a romance will develop between them. Except the movie sure plays the waiting game. Smokey's dance card happens to be real full. She's dating two guys simultaneously. And Ed isn't exactly on the ball when it comes to courting girls. He's a workaholic who thinks marriage is lame.

In its best moments, Government Girl presents a fun, zany vibe. And credit to de Havilland for engaging in physical slapstick. She's pretty much a whirling dervish in this one, whether she's careening down crowded corridors or skidding on her stockinged feet or crawling underneath furniture. It's refreshing when actresses known for their ladylike demeanor let their hair down and act the goof. She must've been so unhappy while filming this, but you can't say she's not a trooper. Just look at her throwing herself around with abandon.

I'll be blunt and say that, while it does have its winning moments, Government Girl lacks the delightful charm, wit, and whimsy of de Havilland's earlier-in-the-year picture, Princess O'Rourke. Who knows how much better Government Girl would've been if only it had landed its earlier choice for male lead, Joseph Cotten. But, somehow, Sonny Tufts got the part. Tufts just doesn't do it for me. He's stiff as a plank and comes off more as one of those supporting characters usually played by blustery cats like Jack Carson. So, no, I don't buy that de Havilland could fall for him, not that they have chemistry anyway. I'm betting RKO's inability to nab Joseph Cotten probably contributed to her getting fed up once and for all and filing that landmark lawsuit against Warner Brothers. As for Government Girl, if you happen to catch it on some classic cable channel, stick around. It's not bad. But de Havilland's done much superior comedies:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hard-to-Get/dp/B002C5VJ24/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hard to Get</a>&nbsp;(1938),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Four-s-a-Crowd/dp/B002LH42H2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Four's a Crowd</a>&nbsp;(1938),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Love-Came-Back/dp/B004NWUREK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Love Came Back</a>&nbsp;(1940), and, of course,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Princess-O-Rourke/dp/B002KE4ZIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Princess O'Rourke</a>.",1440460800,2,4819,5.445783132530121

It was a great light-hearted comedy set during World War II.  I wish it would become available on DVD or blu ray, even if it's an On Demand DVD title.",1408752000,2,315,4.2
