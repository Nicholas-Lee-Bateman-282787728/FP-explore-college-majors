It's not a perfect movie, (there are some continuity errors that are kind of obvious)but it's fun, and that's really what matters. If you just want to have some fun and aren't too worried about details then this is a good movie. If you're someone that obsesses over the details and production value of the movie...well then it's probably not for you. I didn't like all of it, but it had more good than bad, and I thought it was entertaining. (And that is the only really important thing about a movie like this anyway.)",1372291200,3,681,4.5

5722275,1,B00CHMBQCU,"High expectations, low on delivery.  This movie had so much going for it, and traded it all for stereotypes, and bad cliches. Stupid, not funny, kinda sad, seemed to have a decent budget. Story as basically stupid, and very predictable, don't waste your money.",1371945600,2,260,4.909090909090909
5722276,4,B00CHMBQCU,"This is a pretty solid entry into the Horror/Comedy Genre. You have all your usual characters and stereotypes. I'm not mad because I like formulaic Horror movies as long as it's a formula I like and this formula I do. I believe most everyone else who loves this sub genre will love it too.

The comedy is a little over the top as is the acting but it's still a lot of fun and the gore was abundant and fun to watch as well. It's not destined to be a classic or anything but it is a good film that will entertain you and not leave you feeling like you wasted money like so many of late.
Jayson Blair of 'The New Normal' and Krista B.Allen of 'Revenge' were my favorite characters because their acting was so well suited for this film..I say rent it or buy it..You can't go wrong either way because it has the re-watch-ability factor.",1370995200,5,832,4.232704402515723
5722277,4,B00CHMBQCU,"Just finished watching this and I was pretty happy.  This is a solid zombie movie.  I saw it as a zombie comedy and it does pretty well at keeping on task.  It is a story about a bunch of kids that get sent to detention right before a zombie outbreak and shows how the try to survive.  There are of course the typical people there - The jock, nerd, cheerleader, goth chick, skater dude and military guy.  They follow all of the zombie rules and try to survive.  There are a bunch of in jokes in the thing so if you are into the zombie thing you should be able to catch them.  The acting is decent.  You begin to follow the characters and while there isn't enough time to really care about them you do like them.  There is very little cgi and most of the zombie effects are good old fashion makeup.  The effects all around are decent and are good enough to suspend your disbelief for the time you watch it.  There are of course some places where the makeup is obvious but they are few and far between.  The soundtrack is where this movie shines.  It is really good and goes great with the film.  It is actually good enough that I might have to buy it.  This movie is good, it isn't great but it is good.  You could do a lot worse then sit down and watch this.  It is definitely a renter and if you are hardcore it is a keeper.",1369785600,7,1325,4.073643410852713
5722278,2,B00CHMBQCU,"Eddie (Jacob Zachar), a class nerd whom seems to be bullied quite often reports to after school detention, and here he runs into a few classmates along with two of his bullies. Another student reports to the classroom with what appears to be a bite wound. From here the bitten student goes on a rampage and the group realizes their school is under attack by a zombie plague. -summary

Released in 2012 and directed by Alex Craig Mann, Detention of the Dead isn't only just another zombie-comedy, but also another zombie-comedy that merges the undead with John Hughes coming of age classic The Breakfast Club. Indeed, this idea had been done before and far better in Dance of the Dead directed by Gregg Bishop. This movie manages to work pretty well within its setting, unfortunately its less than sub-par when dealing with the zombies and comedy. This movie falls short of even being marginally decent if you're not real easy to please.

It really doesnt take long at all for things to get going. The motley crew of students quickly realize that their school has been overrun by zombie classmates, and their goal is to make it inside the school library and barricade themselves. They accomplish this task and from there they begin to bond; this is when the flick spins its wheels quite often.

Mann draws heavily on John Hughes film as he attempts to build his characters by addressing the usual teenage angst ridden situations; for the most part I can say these characters are somewhat likeable at least, and at times their actions can be well understood. I give Mann props for at least attempting to deliver characters worth caring about, but their interactions can be a bit too long and the zombie element is heavily underutilized. The only purpose the zombies serve is as an outside threat. There really aren't many hair-raising moments or much over the top comedy. In fact, I hardly ever laughed at the supposed comedy.

I cant stress enough on how poorly worked the zombie element was; at least two characters had vast knowledge on dealing with zombies due to them apparently being well versed with the films. I cant recall much about this knowledge being put to entertaining use though, which is really shameful because this opened doors to some nice possibilities.  The movie gives off an illusion as if its going somewhere, yet its still in the same place as it was before. The zombie encounters were standard fare with very little in way of imagination.

The zombie encounters rarely provide any sort of pay off; the clashes against them and gore effects are far below average. I will give some credit to this movie though. I did like the make up job on the zombies; they did have that raging flesh eating appeal to them. I thought the acting for a movie of this type was good. The actors are definitely experienced and worked well with what they had. However, I enjoyed the setting taking place inside the school most. Mann worked well here in establishing some type of belief that Lincoln High School library was the safest place to be and all was indeed lost, in which this works great into the ending.

When looking at numerous results on Detention of the Dead; it amazes me that some people I know enjoyed it so much. I personally believe that many of them were just starving for at least a watchable zombie flick, and I can understand this since there really aren't many out there that should even be bothered with. I only recommend this to zombie fans whom haven't already watched zombie flicks such as The Horde, Dead Snow, Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead, The Dead, Flight of the Living Dead, and even Dance of the Dead. Try not to land yourself in this detention hall too soon.",1454457600,,3691,4.660522273425499

5722282,4,B00CHMBQCU,"Detention of the Dead might be one of the best zombie movies I've seen in a while!  It's a genius idea really- take high school kids, give each kid their own personality, and keep the attention in the classrooms, library and hallways.  Inside the school is where this entire movie takes place.  The film almost works like a zombie-fied version of the Breakfast Club but in a weird twisted comical way.

Anyway you have your quiet goth chick (Alexa Nikolas), your popular snotty head cheerleader (Christa B. Allen), your typical football jocks (Max Adler and Jayson Blair), your Asian drug addict (Justin Chon) and of course, the main character, your typical book/computer nerd (Jacob Zachar).  Oh, and the detention teacher who... well let's just say, her head hangs around throughout the movie, lol.  Really creepy when it blinks sometimes!  These kids all have very little in common, but when it's soon discovered that a zombie outbreak is occurring after one kid in the back of the detention room develops unusual hand pumping movements indicating the changeover into a zombie, the chase for survival is on!

Now I mention this is similar to the Breakfast Club because it actually is.  No it's not actually mocking the movie or anything, but these kids often find themselves in situations where they share things amongst each other with the rest of the group.  These teens constantly find themselves having to protect themselves from the zombie outbreak by boarding up windows and doors and having to escape when the going gets rough.

For the most part this movie tries to present itself as an equal balance of horror and comedy but of course, whenever you deal with zombies you're bound to have intentional or unintentional bits of comedy thrown in.  I mean picking and grabbing the legs of a student and beating zombies as you run down the hallways as a way to escape can't actually be taken seriously!  The scene where one zombie arm reaches through the library wall, grabs Jacob's crotch, and Justin tries to horse-ridingly pull it off Jacob's crotch after the arm is removed from the zombies body is just... LOL!  And when Jayson Blair hides a hand bite... yeah, you know what that means.  It's just amazing his detention mates didn't notice he was hiding his hand under his sleeve, even when he was raising his arm in the air for everyone to see.  And when the snotty cheerleader realizes she's about to be eaten by the zombies on the school rooftop and starts singing Cat Steven's ""Morning Has Broken""... Alexa gives her a weird look, LOL!

I think Detention of the Dead is a really awesome movie.  You really care about every single one of these characters because they're all given the proper time to develop their personalities.  I really liked the Asian kid the most.  He seemed to speak up and cause trouble (bring attention to the group!) during times he should've kept quiet, and the snotty cheerleader is actually really funny too.  She's usually the victim of blood splashing all over her pretty face.  Too bad.  Not quite 5 stars because it's just incredibly silly.  Overall, highly recommended!",1441497600,,3116,4.824858757062147
5722283,2,B00CHMBQCU,"I see what the director and the producers were trying to do by pulling in parts from different movies (Breakfast Club, Sean of the Dead, Napoleon Dynamite, etc) but it just wasn't as fun to watch as it probably was to make.  There was way more squishing and splatting sounds produced in the movie than there were laughs.  And the zombie gore scenes are done much better on TV on The Walking Dead, so the horror part didn't really work either.

The acting was OK.  No real issues there.  The rat though....  pretty weak.",1437523200,,519,4.468085106382978

5722285,4,B00CHMBQCU,"Detention of the Dead (2012)

 Who needs money when you have talent?  That we fans of the bottom rung in moviedom ask regularly.  Seldom does the answer return to us Nobody.  The listed producers include Australian actress Brooke Anderson, Rick Johnson known best as a director, Michael Manasseri who has produced many other projects and James J. Yi, also a producer.  But all of these people have done a wide range of movie tasks from acting to directing to writing to what have you.  In any case these movie people (or TV people) had enough faith in the project to raise a half a million dollars to make the movie.
 All I can say is that Alex Craig Mann, the director/write must have a golden gift for gab to have brought the producers into the production with their money.  Mann has a long list of acting credits but Detention of the Dead makes his first outing as either a writer or director.  The film is based on a play by the same name by Rob Rinow.
 The actors also come with a list of mostly TV but also some film credits.  They are all solid pros and not the night shift workers at Toco Bell that we sometimes get.  Their acting makes the film which frankly otherwise is fairly pedestrian.  We get one new concept in the film.  When folks in this film go Zombie they maintain a smidgen of their old physical traits.  So we have Zombie jocks moving faster than Zombie nerds.  A small thing but different.
 The stand out actors are Jacob Zachar as Eddie, a geek in detention for taking stay awake drugs to study even harder.  He has spoiled his chance at Harvard and naturally feels pretty bad about it.  Alexa Nikolas plays a Goth girl with a heart.  Other kids in detention include a vain cheer leader, her bully boyfriend, a football lineman and best of all Justin Chon as Ash, the stoner kid.  Chon plays his part to the hilt for every laugh he can milk, which turns out to be lots.  Watch for a scene between the geek, the stoner and a severed Zombie arm.  Besides scads of TV work Chon has appeared in two of the Twilight movies.
 Alex Craig Mann, or perhaps the originator of the story Rob Rinow, puts in just enough social commentary to make the film interesting at that level.  The high school kids all have the problems that we remember when we were that age.  No body seems to fit well into the hot house society.  Maybe high school is designed to knock off our jagged corners prior to the big world.  If so, it hurts.
 The Zombies are well made up and traditional shuffler, stagger-er.  Some are just a tad quicker than others.  We have a midget Zombie custodian who is treated just like any other Zombie.  The gore comes in mild seeming  munching.  Lovely Christa B. Allen who plays the cheerleader takes her shirt off but we only see her back.
 This counts as a high quality if not highly original three brain Zombie flick.  I hope the producers get their money back in DVD sales some day.
 Michael Bordo served as assistant makeup artist and is also listed as a makeup intern.  I guess he got promoted in the course of making the film.

5722292,3,B00CHMBQCU,"Ok, this was a low budget movie from 2011 or so.  It has a bunch of stereotypical high schoolers trapped in a high school and surrounded by zombies.  The effects are ok, the zombies can run ,but mostly they just act like a zombie would . slow and plodding.  The stereotypes in this movie do in fact exist even to this day though.  The stoner is as worthless as you would expect and selfish too.  The jock is a idiot, not all jocks are that way. but who cares. This is a very low budget film and at least the actors weren't as bad as some low budgeters seem to be. The effects are decent in a  very low budget way too. This however is not a c- movie those are so badly made that  you know a group of friends made it.  This seems to have professional production values. Is it a good movie? well if you like zomedies. then you may like this one. This however is not near as good as 'dance of the dead' another high school zombie flick.  This is filled with lots of childish sex jokes and such too. . It's enjoyable in that teenage wants sex type of way I guess.

5722295,3,B00CHMBQCU,"This fairly low-budget film was produced and distributed with the help of Starz and Anchor Bay.  All of the lead actors (4 male, 2 female) seem mostly to have appeared on TV until now (the rest of the cast are all undead extras).  On the Internet Movie Database this is rated 4.5 out of 10, and trending downward :-(  If I had to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10,  I guess I'd rate it...""I want 30 of those 87 minutes back!.""  Yes it's intentionally an homage both to ""Breakfast Club"" and George Romero's movies at the least.  [What do you get when you cross them?  Breakfast?]  Although the DVD is not rated, I don't think it would rate an ""R""; perhaps NR-17 at worst.  The brief magazine nudity is so brief and low-profile you'd have to freeze-frame the playback to get much of a look, and as for the characters, there is nothing beyond some kissing, bare lower thighs, brief squeezes, discussion about sex and periodic swearwords.  In short, the movie is probably tamer than going to high school.  Except for the zombies.  There's nothing really new about the zombies, nor does the movie make an effort to actually scare the audience; it seems closer to Breakfast Club than to Night of the Living Dead.  Apart from some clever staging that I overlooked (like all the pencils stuck in the ceiling by bored students) the most interesting part of the film for me was the incipient love stories: relationships possibly in the process of breakup; relationships fantasized; relationships possibly just beginning, and whether (or which) students do or do not transcend the boundaries of their stereotypes and work together, when there's nobody else they can turn to (except for breakfast).  The movie leaves room for a sequel though it's not clear yet whether it will earn enough profit to generate one.  Oh and for the guys (the bulk of the audience for this kind of movie) I have to admit Christa Allen is easy on the eyes (one could only wish the movie had made it into ""R"" territory and/or a stronger love scene) and I'm sure Alexa Nikolas also could look far hotter without the semi-Goth makeup and clothing...",1395964800,2,2108,4.613941018766756

Everyone in the movie seems to be having a good time, including many of the actors playing zombies, but that seems kind of inappropriate since people's lives are supposed to be at stake.  But the biggest problem with Detention of the Dead is that it's probably the least funny zombie comedy ever made--and considering how many zombie comedies there are that's really saying something.

5722309,4,B00CHMBQCU,"Being an older fan of both Zombie movies and John Hughes films, i was fairly pleased with this film.  Though i was not instantly drawn in the first few minutes, by the time the teens got to the library the movie really starts kicking in and flowing.  So, if anything i felt the beginning was a tad rough... maybe due to my age, it is after all a modern take on John Hughes' Breakfast Club so musically and style-wise the beginning may suit today's younger audience.

 I am not saying the beginning sucked, just that it took a bit for me to be drawn to the characters and if anything may have been the one thing this ""did not"" have in common with John Hughes style films since it seemed that all of his movies had my attention even during his strong beginning credits and character set-up.

 It is a nice blend of Romero and Hughes and certainly deserves a place in any zombie movie collection, there is plenty of zombie knowledge behind it and certainly nods to John Hughes even beyond the obvious Breakfast Club detention concept... it more blends Breakfast Club and bits of Some Kind of Wonderful.

 This film is certainly very good, it may not have as much comedy or gore that some may want in a horror or comedy but with the direction they took with the film it certainly is understandable as it would have killed the John Hughes vibe.  If i could give this 4.5 stars i would, but this being Zombie Horror Comedy Coming of Age John Hughes Style film - it may not please everyone, but it does a very good job at trying to achieve so much in one little film and deliver some gut munching, solid funny moments, some drama and even some ""warm-n-fuzzy"" moments.",1376697600,,1660,4.398692810457517

I suspect people are sitting around smoking, brainstorming ideas like, 'Dude, what if we added zombies to ""The Breakfast Club?""' Okay, we noticed.

This is a fun zombie cult film that starts off with our stereotyped kids in detention and moves on from there. Willow (Alexa Nikolas) is the goth chick and the voice of reason who comes up with profound zombie metaphors. Eddie (Jacob Zachar) is the picked on geek, who doesn't have asthma and is not a level 18 wizard. Janet (Christa B. Allen) is our popular head cheerleader with Brad (Jayson Blair) as her jock/ROTC boyfriend who claims he is going to ""officer's boot camp"" after high school. Jimmy (Max Adler) is another jock who follows Brad. Ash (Justin Chon) is a likeable skateboard stoner who sells jocks Midal and tells them it is hash that won't show up on a drug test.

The film gives us a very quick character build up before the zombie attack. Character is later developed in the library, considered a safe haven (""not a single student would be caught dead there""). What made this film good was the dialog....""Stop taunting the undead!"" And the attention to background details such as the large number of pencils stuck in the ceiling in detention and the sign in the background ""Teen Sexual Awareness Week"" like they need one.

5722311,4,B00CHMBQCU,"Do you remember all the typical garbage you had to deal with in high school? You had to wear the right clothes, hang out with the right crowd, and get all your homework done so you could pass. All those seem hard enough to handle. Now add to your laundry list of things to do ""Escape from my fellow students who have turned into zombies."" High School was bad enough before. Imagine having to attend ""Detention of the Dead.""

A nerd, a jock, a cheerleader, a bully, a goth, and a stoner are stuck together in detention. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? It's just a typical afternoon in high school until ravenous zombies overtake the hallways. Now the motley crew of teens must put aside their differences in order to survive a terrifying night of the walking dead.

""Detention of the Dead"" is exactly what it looks and sounds like. It's ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Night of the Living Dead"" blended together. It's impressive how well Director/Co-Writer Alex Craig Mann takes a zombie apocalypse and uses it for the backdrop of a film about six high schoolers from different walks of life. Not only are they struggling to fight the stereotypes, but now they have to save themselves from being devoured by masses of teenage walking dead.

There are several ways ""Detention of the Dead"" pays homage to ""The Breakfast Club."" Each of the characters here are basically updates of the ones in John Hughes' legendary film. At one point, the kids climb through the air ducts, just like Judd Nelson's character did in the classic 1980's film. No matter how tough Nelson's character was, he would have freaked out and ran in the other direction if he came face-to-face with these flesh-eaters.

It's nice to see a movie where practical effects take front and center. Every scene of zombie carnage uses real props, giving the film a classic flavor sorely missing these days. The makeup for the living dead is good for the most part, with only a few missteps here and there when it comes to detail. This minor fault can be overlooked if you take into account how many people had to have makeup applied. Add to that the fact this is a low-budget flick shot in a small time frame.

The cast of ""Detention of the Dead"" is an impressive mix of television and movie stars. Christa B. Allen of ""Revenge"" plays the cheerleader. ""Greek's"" Jacob Zachar portrays the nerd. Alexa Nikolas of ""Zoey 101"" and ""The Walking Dead"" takes on the role of the goth girl. Jayson Blair from ""The Hard Times of RJ Berger"" and ""The New Normal"" is the bully. ""The Twilight Saga's"" Justin Chon plays the stoner. Max Adler of ""Glee"" portrays the jock.

""Detention of the Dead"" is unrated, but if put before the MPAA would be given an R. There's plenty of gore and bloody violence to satisfy bloodhounds. The language is what you would expect from a movie set in a high school. There's no nudity, but plenty of adult situations and sexual humor.

The special features for ""Detention of the Dead"" will satisfy consumers. There's a 42-minute Behind The Scenes feature which includes interviews with the cast and crew as well as plenty of footage from the making of the movie. Audio commentary is provided by Executive Producer/Writer/Director Alex Craig Mann.

Zombie films are a dime a dozen these days, and they're all preaching some type of serious social commentary. ""Detention of the Dead"" rises above the multitudes of ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""The Walking Dead"" impersonators by injecting a dose of comedy and relatable characters to the recipe. Everybody went to high school and they all fell into one of the social circles represented in the movie. The only difference here is that viewers probably didn't have run-ins with zombies stumbling through the hallways. Okay, I'm not counting the potheads or druggies shuffling by as you ran to class before the tardy bell rings.",1375315200,,3838,4.735029940119761
5722312,3,B00CHMBQCU,"""Detention of the Dead"" focuses on a group of high school kids sentenced to after-school detention. When the school is attacked by flesh-eating zombies, the six trapped students -- lovesick nerd Eddie (Jacob Zachar), goth chick Willow (Alexa Nikolas), stuck-up cheerleader Janet (Christa B. Allen), her bully boyfriend Brad (Jayson Blair), stoner Ash (Justin Chon), and dumb jock Jimmy (Max Adler) -- must battle hordes of the hungry undead.

Though the characters are glaringly stereotypical, they are also zombie-knowledgeable. Because they have seen the zombie flicks and learned what works and what doesn't, they feel reasonably equipped to confront the attackers. Combining some grisly images with frequent touches of dark humor, the picture plays like an apocalyptic ""Breakfast Club,"" with teenage angst trumping imminent annihilation.

Special features on this DVD release include writer/director audio commentary and a making-of featurette.",1374883200,,948,5.81294964028777
5722313,3,B00CHMBQCU,"TO avid zombie movie fans this movie would be all right.  Nothing great, nothing classic or groundbreaking, just ok.  To people that don't care much for zombie flicks this wouldn't be your cup of tea at all.  This movie has some of the normal zombie movie features, it includes gore, zombies, fun, a bit of comedy.. It's a B flick that follows a group of breakfast club teenagers (nerd,jock, stoner,cheerleader,goth girl) around the high school as zombies try to eat them.  Not many zombie kills in this one.  Like I said, IT'S OK, nothing big.",1374624000,3,544,4.684210526315789
5722314,4,B00CHMBQCU,"I'm not much for Zombie comedies but occasionally they can be fun.  Shawn of the Dead and Zombieland come to mind as a couple of Zombie comedies that were not only funny but had enough good action, story line, and well scripted that made them worthwhile to watch more than once.  Detention of the Dead is not a repeater, I doubt seriously if I'll ever feel the need to watch it again.  It had some funny moments and some action but not a lot of story or script to it.  Played a little too much on the Breakfast Club.  The acting was decent and the Zombie effects actually weren't half bad.",1374364800,7,589,4.27027027027027
5722315,5,B00CHMBQCU,"*I received a screener copy of this film for review; I am in no way compensated for my reviews.

Growing up, one of my favorite non-horror 80s movies was THE BREAKFAST CLUB.  Like many others of my generation, even back then I recognized the high school caste system that was in place and the ridiculousness of it; John Hughes simply brought this out in the open, for the less-knowing masses to see.  Anchor Bay's latest release DETENTION OF THE DEAD takes this high school hierarchy a step further and brings zombies into the mix.  The result is a hilarious horror romp that entertains on several levels.

I am impressed with this film for several reasons.  This could have been a disaster, given the somewhat cheesy premise, but director Alex Craig Mann makes sure the movie never takes itself too seriously and keeps the action flowing at a nice pace.  The film looks great, the actors are top notch, and the production value appears high overall.  In short, this is a damn good zombie flick.

One major reason for DETENTION OF THE DEAD's success is the acting.  Each actor skillfully portrays their stereotyped character with great ease.  From the arrogant, bullying jock, to the self-centered cheerleader, to the dorky, big-hearted geek...every level of high school society is represented here in a monumental way.

Another reason is the special effects.  The zombies look great and the gore is fantastic.  I am particularly impressed with the carnage, as I don't believe any good living dead flick should be without some gore.  And the production team doesn't spare much expense.  There's even a horrific zombie rat!!

DETENTION OF THE DEAD is a major win for me and I think every zombie fan should check it out.  It is a film that knows exactly what it is and doesn't try to be anything but funny and horrifying.  If you like SHAUN OF THE DEAD, I will wager you will like this one.  The film hits store shelves next week, so give it a look.",1374019200,,1947,4.687315634218289
5722316,3,B00CHMBQCU,"Had the late, great John Hughes made 'The Breakfast Club' as a zombie movie, he might have ended up with DETENTION OF THE DEAD.  The plot is very basic: a group of oddball high school stereotypes - the nerd, the cheerleader, the jock, the stoner, the goth girl, the big stupid bully - all find themselves trapped in their high school when, while they're all stuck in detention late one afternoon, a zombie attack turns their classmates and teachers who were left behind into the brain-eating living dead.  The film basically concerns itself with how they will get out/survive, and definitely has its moments of both being funny and some decent zombie/gore scenes for sure ...

But whereas 'The Breakfast Club' achieved its brilliance by allowing us to see beyond the stereotypes - to truly end up caring about the characters - 'Detention of the Dead' has characters that never stray from their labels (even the goth girl showing her vulnerable side, in the end, has become stereotypical), therefore making it hard to give that much of a hang about what happens to them (with one exception, and he was one of the biggest reasons I wanted to see the film: Justin Chon, who seems to be having a ball here as the Asian stoner who has more than a little fun with a zombie teachers head, after cutting it off).  The zombie action is cool, the actors (including Christa B. Allen from ""Revenge"", playing the vain blonde head cheerleader) make the most of their material ... but if you want a truly great, truly bloody but also damned funny teen/high school zombie movie, the brilliant 'Dance of the Dead' provides both more thrills and more laughs.  This one is just ""okay"" ... more like 2-1/2 stars.",1372896000,,1692,4.683501683501683
5722317,3,B00CHMBQCU,"Take the Breakfast club, and add a zombie outbreak and you can pretty much get the entire drift of this film. A bunch of high schooler's detention suddenly becomes interrupted when a zombie plague runs wild throughout the school. So it's on for a battle of survival and finding places to hide as the halls become infested with the walking dead wanting to devour the living. Wait, I just said that... then re-worded it... I guess that's it, you've seen this plot before. But how does this movie come off in the end?

It's ok, not really worth a second viewing. The leading man is a dork, he has a crush on the cheerleader bimbo, of coarse her jock boyfriend has to tag along, and then there is the stoner, another jock and a cute goth girl. Overall, the film has a bit of blood and gore, and can be humerus at times, but what it needed was either go all out with the blood and make it funny because it is so gory, or have more jokes and make it funnier. It mostly just sits in limbo, and is expected to be passed off as a bloody comedy, but it almost tries to take itself too seriously in some parts, or they just forgot to comb down the drama and play it less straight faced.

It's a fun movie, worthy of seeing once, it's not one you will want to turn off because it's so lame, least I don't think so. Predictable ending, but hey, they all are aren't they?",1372809600,,1357,4.195402298850575
8581811,4,B00CHMBQCU,"what a lot of fun this movie was. first of all let me tell you that the cast is absolutely perfect, we have the of course very diverse group of students, the nerd, the goth, the jocks and the teem queen and others. All of these kids get involved in the same class when a fellow student comes down with a case of zombie-ism and infects the teacher and well it all happens from there. Our intrepid students realize that something is wrong with the other students. They take refuge in the school library. There are many good laughs here and eve  a few frights. I really enjoyed Jacob Zachar as the nerd. But to be honest the entire case is excellent. I recommend this movie to any fans of a fun time.",1497052800,,697,4.2406015037593985
