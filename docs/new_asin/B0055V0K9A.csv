8458876,4,B0055V0K9A,I am a huge DCD fan for 18 years and would never give them a bad review. I was told this was the DVD concert and it was a CD which I already owned. I gave it away and seller gave me a refund too so all is well,1372377600,,209,3.2857142857142856
8458877,4,B0055V0K9A,"In 1993, Dead Can Dance, the somewhat unclassifiable duo of Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry, released their sixth album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Into-the-Labyrinth/dp/B000002MM8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Into the Labyrinth</a>&nbsp;and undertook their first tour in four years. Performances from two nights at Los Angeles' Mayfair Theatre were combined into a single ""live album"", released as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/a-CD/dp/B001FZ0A86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">a CD</a>, on VHS and eventually as the DVD described in this Amazon listing.

TOWARD THE WITHIN is not a typical live album, as Dead Can Dance concerts did not have a typical setlist: most of the songs here had never been recorded before. Only ""Cantara"", ""Song of the Sibyl"", ""Yulunga"" and ""The Wind that Shakes the Barley"" were drawn from previous albums, while the other material had only been heard in earlier tours or is premiered here for the first time. One of the most striking innovations on the 1993 tour was that Brendan Perry started performing his own singer-songwriter material in the vein of Tim Buckley and Nick Drake, mostly just him and an acoustic guitar. Perhaps to compete with Lisa Gerrard's famously nonsensical vocals, lyrics sung in some made-up language, Perry drawls out the words of his songs to such a degree that nearly two decades after first hearing this, I still have no idea what he's singing at times.

There are plenty of ethnobeats here, however. The duo was touring with percussionists Robert Perry, Rnn  Snodaigh and Lance Hogan, as well as keyboardists Andrew Claxton and John Bonnar. Even Gerrard and Perry contribute to percussionist at times. ""Cantara"", the album recording of which was focused around synthesizer and multitracked, vocals is here transformed into a furious percussive track, with Gerrard playing finger cymbals and singing more savagely than she ever had before. On ""Oman"", Perry sings in eschatz Arabic over richly polyrhythmic drumming, and he's visibly thrilled to play a darbouka. ""Rakim"", the concert's opener, opens with Gerrard's yang'qin, but eventually the drums come in and Gerrard and Perry duet on vocals, which I wish they had done more often.

A song from the CD is missing on the DVD, namely ""Yulunga"". However, the DVD does have one song missing from the CD, ""Gloridean"", where Brendan Perry sits out and the percussionists come up to join Gerrard in her glossolalia vocals. Between the songs, there passages of interview with Gerrard and Perry. Though he seems a little unprepared to discuss his work, Perry gives some helpful background on DCD's philosophy. Gerrard, however, is such a space cadet that I'm tempted to fast-forward through her interviews.

The concert video was shot in 70mm by Mark Magidson, who had recently done&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baraka/dp/B001CDLAT4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baraka</a>, one of the most visually stunning films of all time. Unfortunately, the richness of Magidson's footage does not fully come across in DVD. The 70mm was already a little grainy due to the venue's lighting, but add the compression of low-definition DVD video, and it doesn't look so good. Now that people are accustomed to the higher detail of HD video, TOWARD THE WITHIN desperately needs a re-release in Bluray format. There is only one audio track, 2-channel (stereo) Dolby Digital.

Besides the actual 1993 concert recording, the DVD has some extras. There are two promotional videos for songs from INTO THE LABYRINTH, ""The Carnival is Over"" whose cast is various circus performers, and ""Yulunga"" which consists of footage from Magidson's film BARAKA. There are also the two videos for ""Frontier"" and ""The Protagonist"", the songs DCD contributed to the 4AD label's LONELY IS AN EYESORE project in 1987.",1368921600,3,3910,5.663822525597269

8458879,5,B0055V0K9A,Some have said the quality is not good. I found the picture quality to be very good on my Panasonic plasma HDTV and the sound quality was excellent on my home theater system. Thank goodness it's DVD instead of tape or this would be worn out already. Some tracks I will repeat many times. The interviews are informative and just the right length each time.,1325203200,3,355,4.476923076923077
