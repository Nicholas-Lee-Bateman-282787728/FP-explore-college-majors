I hope that a collection of the bands' earlier performances will be released. One can always search the vaults of YouTube but that just makes you want a better remastered version.
All the classics are on this ""Divinyls Live"" DVD and one song in particular really powers up..""Ain't gonna eat out my Heart Anymore"". It would have be great to have far more bonus features for this iconic band.
BTW this DVD is mastered for PAL format and not NTSC.",1297641600,,606,4.568807339449541
8072877,5,B000A2WP42,"This one's that kind of DVD that makes a fan out from any newcomer, and proud if you're already a commited fan.

Chrissy's performance, vocals and character is just fantastic throughout the whole show, and the band itself helps making it the best.

It's simply essential on any DiVinyls collection.",1236211200,,298,4.94
8072878,5,B000A2WP42,"This is an Excellent Live Concert of the Divinyls! Buyer beware though - It is PAL formatted for Australia and NOT NTSC as listed here. I checked it with Umbrella Entertainment who produced it and they said it's ONLY in PAL format. Thankfully I have a DVD player that it works on so it's No Worries, Mate! Christina Amphlett and Mark McEntee are in top form here. My only complaint is that it's not long enough to contain all of my favorite songs. Elsie would also have been a good addition. It focuses mostly on the Album diVINYLS era songs but it was made in 1993 so that's where they were at in their career. I'd recommend this for Every Divinyls fan (with a PAL compatible DVD player).",1212451200,6,689,4.390625
8072879,5,B000A2WP42,"It is a shame that little is known about this show outside Australia. The year was 1993, after some international commercial success Mark and Chrissy toured extentively with a bunch of extras and rocked venues big and small with their explosive stage act.

Divinyls along with fellow Aussie rock acts (Rose Tattoo and Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs) were part of a triple headline at the rock concert at Queenslands notorious Boggo Road Prison, which has since been decommissioned.

The band launch into their debut hit ""Boys In Town"" from the very start you will be captivated by Mark McEntee, forever underrated as one of rocks finest rhythm/lead guitarists, who literally goes berserk on a series of Gibson and Rickenbakers and plays all night like a man possessed, his guitar work is the highlight of the entire show.

Who can forget Chrissy. At this time the new wave quirkiness and wild child persona that captivated so many audiences in the early to mid 80's had been replaced by Chrissy the sexpot, a voice aged by the excesses of the rock and roll lifestyle, her voice much more huskier than you may have heard on the bands popular radio hits, however she still performs with gusto like only she can.

Highlights are:

""I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore"" which is the best performances of the entire show. As I mentioned Mark McEntee's guitar virtuoso makes this DVD a must purchase, alone. The reserved blond guitarist lets rip with riff after riff, playing ringing appregios with melodic ease and then bluesy hard rock workouts, his playing is like 3 guitarists.

Chrissy's vocal highlight of the night is definately the ending song ""Pleasure and Pain""

Chrissy dons the fishnet stockings but shows no cleavage. Her dress sense borders along the line of sexual provocativeness and that of the woman she started to rediscover in recent years, the demured, more conservative, sensual artist who had fooled the world with her trademark Bogan Wild Child Rock Chick persona.

And if you are wondering the band delivers the obligatory ""I Touch Myself"".

Since you American DiVinyls fans know that song very well, the thing you can take out of this concert is to get an appreciation of how this band went down with their home crowd, the Aussie rock classics that are well known and loved in Australia and a different side to the style of music synonomous with their commercial peak in your part of the world.

Fingers are crossed for a comeback tour on the back of the bands induction in the Australian Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame. Chrissy Amphlett is currently playing Judy Garland in the stage show starring Hugh Jackman ""The Boy From OZ""

We are not sure what Mark is doing at the moment, probably sipping tea and glossing over the latest fashions from his and the missus's fashion label in his native Western Australia.

Get this DVD, I go as far in saying, if you buy one Aussie rock show, it must be Divinyls!",1163635200,9,2920,4.73767258382643
