The wonderful thing about making your own papers is that, since you know the lightfastness of the products you use in making your papers, you can be much more confident about the longevity of your finished work. I love Janes teaching style; she uses the perfect mix of detail and humor when demonstrating techniques and providing tips for achieving success in creating interesting collages! Its just a GREAT video!",1510963200,,553,5.087912087912088

8611647,5,B00F1YCJR2,Jane Davies is a great teacher of every technique demonstrated. Her voice is encouraging as well as motivating. I've taken a workshop with her after seeing and using her video- a testament to her teaching and artistic skills.,1412121600,5,225,4.947368421052632
8611648,5,B00F1YCJR2,"Just viewed this for the first time and loved it!  Although I took notes, I will be using this as a reference for a while to come.
Over the past 6 or 7 years that I have been doing art journaling, mixed media collage and so on, I've gradually progressed to the point where what I see is a lot of the same 'ol, same 'ol and I keep looking for teachers near my home because I'm unable to travel. Alas, very few come to this part of the world. The closest is often Santa Fe.
This is an hour and 40 minutes, well worth the price. Jane does some techniques I've seen before and she takes others and puts her own spin on them so they seem new and interesting. She does layering in a fresh way and uses unique color combinations.  About an hour is taken up with techniques which you can spend hours just playing with! The last 30 minutes is composition where she first demonstrates a ""collage study"" and then a piece intended for display. In both, she describes her process step by step. If you're interested in mixed media collage, learn from this master.
(I would not recommend this for the complete beginner)",1387756800,13,1104,4.302884615384615
