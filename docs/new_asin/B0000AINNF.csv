Most all delve into the depths of lesbian rape, guard abuse and political coruption to one degree or another.  This has all the usual elements, but something just isn't quite right.

A woman is falsely accused of a crime and sent to prison (no one ever commits crimes do they) where she vows to uncover the truth and seek revenge.  Nothing we haven't heard before.

Only half the total tale takes place in prison, the other half is after her (unexciting) escape.  From there the story goes through a series of increasingly less plausable events and twists till the limply delivered conclusion.

Being a fan of cheese flicks, I consider myself fairly willing to forgive lapses in logic and mediocre acting, just so long as the depraived goods are delivered.  Sadly, here we have a film that is pulp-cheese to the core but seems oddly ashamed of the very elements that construct it.  Violence is very tame and the nudity/sex is almost coy in it's presentation, leaving one the ponder why this should exist in the first place.  I will say in a positive light that I was curious as to whether or not she would get her revenge, and that accounts for the 2/5 stars.

Like a song without a beat or a painting without an image, this is a film that offers very little, even to fans of the material.
