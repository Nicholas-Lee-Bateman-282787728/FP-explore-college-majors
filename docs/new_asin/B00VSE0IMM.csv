7101419,5,B00VSE0IMM,"This is a great movie. When to see it last night (4/10) with my mom & we both said at the same time ""I have to put this movie in my collection.""",1428710400,3,144,3.53125
7101420,5,B00VSE0IMM,"Well I'll be hornswoggled if it isn't Clint Eastwood's son Scott starring in Nicholas Sparks' (""The Notebook""), one of those two-hankie romances that Sparks does so successfully.

Directed by George Tillman Jr. (""Faster"") using Craig Bolotin's script based on the Sparks' novel, this PG-13 chick flick makes nice exposure for an attractive young couple who learn that the secret of ""The Longest Ride"" (marriage) is not only love, but also sacrifice and compromise.

We watch:
  * Scott Eastwood (""Fury"") Luke is a bull rider (an 8 second ride is the goal) looking for a comeback from a severe head injury a year earlier. He has an old-fashioned way about him that is soooo appealing.
  * Britt Robertson (""Delivery Man"") Sophia is on her way to Manhattan to pursue a career in art when a sorority sister drags her to a bull-riding competition. She has never dated a man who has nice manners.
  * Alan Alda (""The Blacklist"") is Ira, an elderly man whom Luke and Sophia rescue when he suffers a heart attack on a lonely country road. His treasured box contains the story which plays on two tracks, one in his memories and the other in the present.
  * Jack Huston (""Boardwalk Empire"") plays the younger Ira who falls instantly in love when he sees that lovely Jewish refugee from Europe. It's 1940 and her family left just in time.
  * Oona Chaplin (""The Crimson Field"") is young Ruth, that refugee who can't see any reason to delay. She wants what she wants and intends to get started right away! Ruth is charming but determined.

Time spent on the battlefield (WWII) is vital to the story, so we coped with the gunfire and the blood. This film has no car chases, profanity or fisticuffs, but it does have full backtal nudity (of Mr. E.) and implied sexual situations, tastefully done. Whew!

Once again I am reminded what a perfectly splendid actor we have in Alan Alda. There isn't a moment when we weren't completely convinced by his character. He is a treasure. Young Mr. Eastwood looks disconcertingly like his father. It almost detracts from his own appeal. (The women left this screening with big smiles on their faces, the men saw it more as an endurance test.) We liked it.",1428624000,82,2181,4.690288713910761

7101428,5,B00VSE0IMM,"The first time I saw this movie, I didn't really like it all that much. I didn't hate it. But I didn't like it. I don't know what it was, but I just couldn't get into it. But I decided to give it another chance. And another, and another and... It got better with each viewing until I discovered I really loved it! Go figure. Maybe it was the two story lines that threw me off in the beginning. Maybe it was the typical city-girl-meets-country-boy theme. Whatever it was, I wasn't feeling it. However once I gave the movie a second chance, I saw things I didn't see the first time around. Took a closer look at the characters and their stories. Bottom line, I ended up loving the movie and now consider it a favorite go-to, when I'm looking for a feel-good moment.",1531526400,,763,4.305555555555555

7101448,1,B00VSE0IMM,A kiddie boy supposed cowboy... 'chickie flick' and I couldn't get through the first 10 minutes! Somebody mislead me by saying it was a rodeo movie. Far from it! The Eastwoods can certainly do better than what I saw.,1527206400,,216,4.564102564102564
7101449,5,B00VSE0IMM,"There was so much more to this movie than what I thought it would be.  It's not just about a cowboy falling in love.  There are more levels to this and so many twists of what I thought was going to happen, or how I thought this would end...it just kept me guessing until the very end.  What chemistry and great acting as well.  I found myself in tears of sadness, along with tears of joy.  It's definitely a must see, and now one of my favorite movies of all time!!",1527120000,,465,4.065934065934066

Had to fast forward through the bull riding, no interest in that; (skillfully fast forward so as to not miss anything.) I find Britt Robertson to be a very charismatic, authentic actress who really reaches her audience, at least for me. Like her very much and looking forward to more films she's in. Hope she chooses well and keeps to the high road in quality films.",1522195200,,521,4.494736842105263

7101554,5,B00VSE0IMM,"The first time I saw The Longest Ride movie was in 2015 at a movie theater with a couple of my friends. I have watched this movie so many times, Ive lost count. I usually don't enjoy sitting down and watching movies, but The Longest Ride was different and made me not want to stop watching it. This movie is enjoyable for my family to watch because it includes some funny and serious parts, and, of course, my brothers love the cowboy parts.
 The producers and directors of The Longest Ride put in lots of thought for the sound effects and music. For example, the guy is bull riding and gets injured pretty bad. The sound effects did a great job at giving off that suspicion if he was going to bull ride again or not. I love how the movie kept me on my toes. The main characters, Luke Collins (Scott Eastwood) and Sophia Danko (Britt Robertson), did magnificent at filling their parts. This movie was a romantic and dramatic movie, but its different than the original romantic movies. This movie--mature and musing-- was well acted and entertaining. Eastwood and Robertson brought out that chemistry in the movie. In fact, Scott Eastwood won the Teen Choice Movie Actor Award: Drama in 2015 for his acting in The Longest Ride. Britt Robertson was nominated that same year for Choice Movie Actress: Drama. Together, they did a stunning job. I thought Eastwood and Robertson fit their parts perfectly. I am not the only one who thinks so, because, according to Google Users, 91% find this movie likable.
 This particular movie has two different stories being told simultaneously. The movie goes back and forth between a current relationship and a past relationship. It starts out with a girl finding this cowboy and continues on about the sacrifices of the cowboys love for the girl and bull riding. Then, this older man is introduced and talks about what sacrifices his wife and him had to make. Both of these stories being told in one movie is something different that I haven't seen in other movies. The director did amazing at setting up the structure of the movie.
The Longest Ride was well-written and acted. The actors chosen for this movie did such a great job; they were nominated and won awards from this movie. Also, the movie has not one, but two significant and inspiring stories being told in it. One reviewer explained how this movie shows that happy endings don't always happen and everyone has to make sacrifices for the ones they care about and The Longest Ride did great at showing how romantic movies should be shown. Other reviewers have said The Longest Ride was an authentic film and fun to watch. I agree and thought the movie was really great and well put together. I would encourage watchers and buyers that enjoy cowboy, thrilling, and romantic movies to watch or buy this movie!",1509321600,,2804,4.685598377281948

The film is another entity entirely.  The characters are interesting and well played and the storyline is concise to keep the viewer interested.  Alan Alda plays the narrator of his past with his beloved wife Ruth.  The actors playing their younger counterparts are well cast and shows what a loving heart both of them had.

Let me know next time that I am about to watch a tiny bopper movie before I buy it. First 5 second you see its about college. Lame.,1491264000,,285,3.847457627118644

7101670,4,B00VSE0IMM,"This movie wasn't as terrible as I was expecting. A little cheesy at times, but that is expected when watching a Nicholas Sparks romance. Very sweet and the message was meaningful. I was surprisingly able to convince my boyfriend to watch it with me, he definitely thought it was silly but it was a great movie to cuddle up next to him. If you're in the mood for a cheesy but very cute romance, this is a good choice.",1490572800,2,417,4.291139240506329

I don't want to say too much so as not to give anything away. Eastwood is a talented actor. He can be a tough guy and a romantic all in one movie and switch between the two easily. Britt Robertson was a natural for the part. Excellent movie, I don't think you will be disappointed. It isn't just another chick flick.",1489881600,3,456,4.134831460674158
7101676,5,B00VSE0IMM,"Such a wonderful story (the book is always better)- Nicholas Sparks writes so well- characters develop along with the plot. While the themes which emerge within the characters seem very unlikely in the real world, the suspension of disbelief remains throughout the show- the ending, while heartwarming,... was a little too much--- put yourself in the shoes of a collector who attends the auction and think about the likelihood of that ending. It's a good story. Much like the others Sparks has written- well worth viewing, at least once.",1489881600,,537,5.044943820224719

7101698,2,B00VSE0IMM,"I don't even have to watch the movie to know that I will be seriously disappointed in it.  I have read the book several times and the trailer showed that they have changed the storyline in several Key points.  Alan Alda as a favored actor of mine, a genuine talent, and I was pleasantly surprised to see him take the lead as Ira. He will definitely be able to bring the feel and emotion of a will live role to the screen but it looks like the role has been severely cut from the book.  It really is the perspective of a relationship at its beginning and a relationship in its completion that bring the true depth and meaning of this story.

It's just too bad that the director and screenwriter didn't Understand it.",1487116800,,715,4.313432835820896

Britt Robertson's laughter was a bit annoying at first, but both Robertson and Eastwood brought it home at the end.

7101825,5,B00VSE0IMM,"Nicholas Sparks has an enduring audience  his novels are read by those of all age who love romance stories and his books are consistently transformed into successful films. In the case of THE LONGEST RIDE the screenwriter is Craig Bolton and he ha managed to make Sparks story even more significant and touching than the original book. Much of that is, of course, due to director George Tillman, Jr. and a cast able to create the present and the past with aplomb.

At first the audience may be put off by the violent brutality of bull riding  violent for both the bull and the human rider  but as the story progresses this degree of gut courage and commitment plays well in the film. The story centers on the star-crossed love affair between Luke (Scott Eastwood, a significant growth in presence), a former champion bull rider looking to make a comeback, and Sophia (Britt Robertson), a college student at Wake Forest in North Carolina who is about to embark upon her dream job in New York City's art world. As conflicting paths and ideals test their relationship, Sophia and Luke make an unexpected connection with injured Ira Levinson (Alan Alda) whose memories of his own decades-long romance with his beloved wife (the young Ira being played by Jack Huston and his wife Ruth played by Oona Chaplin) deeply inspire the young couple. Spanning generations and two intertwining and very parallel love stories, THE LONGEST RIDE explores the challenges and infinite rewards of enduring love.

In addition to the mentioned actors, supporting roles are well managed by Lolita Davidovich as Lukes mother and Elea Oberon as Ruths mother and Kate Forbes as Iras mother. Mark Isham wrote the musical score. The inclusion of fine art plays a major role, both in the parallel stories of Sophia and Ruth and in the sensitive manner in which the story ends. THE LONGEST RIDE is a sweet and satisfying film. Grady Harp, December 16",1482710400,,1919,4.820668693009119

7101905,4,B00VSE0IMM,"Unlike most Nicholas Sparks' movies, I actually enjoyed this one. It seemed a bit less contrived and employed many of the same plot devices as The Notebook. For me, it was the dual timeline that really kept the film from moving into cheeseball territory, with the better performances and storyline happening in flashback. Alan Alda is wonderful as Ira Levinson, and the relationship between he and the movie's heroine, was actually, in many ways, more compelling than her relationship with bull rider, Luke Collins. This was a hero who was a bit lackluster compared to some of other Sparks' heroes (namely, Ryan Gosling.)

The real highlight of the film is the Oona Chaplin and John Huston who played young Ruth and Ira. Ruth, especially, is the kind of character who instantly draws you in and you absolutely love her from the get-go. Huston's performance as a shy, unassuming young Ira is believably passionate about Ruth--it's the kind of stuff romance is made of. In contrast, Eastwood and Robertson came off looking like two frisky teenagers, nothing of depth between them, only physical attraction. It made their part of the story pale in comparison.

Overall, the historical timeline was enough to keep the movie moving forward, to keep me engaged, and to keep the cheesy parts of the movie from being too cheesy.",1475539200,5,1320,4.941441441441442

Nicholas Sparks has a thing for old love and new love. I really like how he intertwines his stories with different sets of characters and different time periods. The chemistry may have been a little off between the main two characters, in my opinion, but Scott Eastwood is definitely easy on the eyes. :-)",1457654400,,471,4.363636363636363

It is a story of about legacy, war, sacrifice, tragedy and most of all, real love not allowing one to take the easy way out.  The characters are richly drawn (Alan Alda steals the show), and the film although not without flaws is so beautifully told that I cannot recommend it enough  It did not feel sappy to me.  It just felt deep and real...  about the challenges of real love, and grasping it with both hands when it comes.  Take a chance on one of 2015 underrated gems.  You will be immersed in this beautiful tale that will make you believe once again.",1457308800,,733,4.392592592592592

7102255,5,B00VSE0IMM,"The Longest Ride, based on the book by Nicholas Sparks, is an unusual love story that will have you yearning for a love like Sofia and Lukes. Its not your average love story that is predictable and worn-out, but encompasses a twist that unites the past and present with love and a passion for art. The unconditional love, pain, and life changing decisions that transpire throughout the movie, keep you hanging on and pull on your emotions.
Sofia is a girl in college with big dreams of moving to New York, and Luke is a former champion bull rider from North Carolina, looking for a comeback. They end up crossing paths, but seem to be going in different directions. They come from such different worlds. Her life involves art and the city, and his life involves bull riding and the country. When they come upon an old man named Ira, in a car accident, they decide to help, and it changes their lives forever.
The movie has times where it flashes back to the past of Iras life, but thats what makes the movie unique. It is very original when it comes to love stories which makes it worthy, because in todays media all romantic movies usually seem to have the same plot. We come to hope that the future of the characters turns out how we want, and we begin to care about them. The production and storyline of the movie enables this to happen. Throughout the film you cheer for Sofia in two different ways, you want her to fall in love, but then you want her to chase her dreams in New York. She is such an intelligent and bright young girl, and has so many things going on, but you want them to all work out for her. Throughout the movie she tries to fit in to Lukes world, but it gets harder and harder. At times as the movie develops, you don't think that Sofia and Luke are going to stay together, their worlds are just to different. The direction of the movie makes you fall in love with the characters, and how you want them to end up together.
All of the characters work together very well. They all connect in different ways and really bring the storyline together as a whole. The older gentleman, Ira, is the one who brings Sofia and Luke together, and the one who keeps them together. He creates the bond between them that is indescribable. The two main characters, played by Britt Robertson and Scott Eastwood, play their parts in truth, and they make love look effortless. Scott isn't a real bull rider, but he is such a great actor that he makes it look like he is a real cowboy. He has a stunt double do the riding for him, but the production of the movie doesnt let that on at all. Scott Eastwood has starred in a few films before like Fury and Texas Chainsaw 3D, but this was his first movie where he played the lead. It has helped him to become a rising star, and you should definitely keep an eye out for him in movies coming out in the future.
This movie is unlike any love story you have seen before, and it will have you wanting more. The story tugs on your heart throughout the whole movie, and won't leave you disappointed. George Tillman did a great job at directing, and definitely created a must see movie.",1456185600,,3129,4.35042735042735

7102279,5,B00VSE0IMM,"In The Longest Ride, there were 3 main characters, Ira, Sophia, and Luke. In the beginning of the novel, Sophia is at a rodeo that Luke happened to be competing in; Ira was in a ditch trapped in his car after driving off the side of the road. Throughout the novel, we learn about the longtime love story between Ira, and his now deceased wife, Ruth. Ira tells stories about what they used to do and how they used to act as he is in a race with time before he passes away after the accident. The rest of the chapters are the developing love story between Sophia and Luke; meeting unexpectedly and falling in love quickly. Into their relationships, secrets are revealed, some that may affect their future forever. Compromises are made and relationships are always being tested but somehow they constantly figure out how to make it work.
 In this story I could relate to Sophia the most because she is introduced to a whole new world and I have felt like that before. She has to constantly adapt to what is changing and what is going on around her. She has come over obstacles socially that have proven her as a person and I think everyone has felt like that at some point.
 Overall, I really enjoyed this novel. As soon as I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. There are many layers to each of the characters that I loved uncovering. I am a sucker for love stories and this one was absolutely no different. My favorite part of the book was when Sophia and Luke were up in the mountains for the weekend and learned more about each other without the distraction of the outside world in the way. Also, at this point in the novel Ira gets found and the love story keeps building up between him and Ruth. This is definitely one of the best books I have ever read. Within the book, there is a distinct difference between the two characters that fall in love and I like reading about the adaptations each of them make to fit the others lifestyle. I would recommend this book to almost anyone who is interested in the romance novels.",1454976000,,2031,4.398936170212766

He is gorgeous just like his Dad.  I loved him in the movie as well as his girlfriend Britt Robertson and Alan Alda.  I  have watched it about 12 times now and it is still fun to watch but sad.  I love it, I love it, I love it.......I have two copies of the movie just in case something happens to one.  That is how much I love it.  The acting was just superb and the feeling between Scott and Britt was magnifying.  I may  be an old lady but I enjoy romance in the movies.

7102326,4,B00VSE0IMM,"Let me start off by saying that I do not typically like Nicholas Sparks movies besides A Walk to Remember. I saw one in theaters (Dear John) and it was a movie I didn't like. This one I decided to try because it is about bull riding and a bit different than the typical ones. This one didn't jump right into the romance and had a nice twist in the story that was not really shown in any trailer. Any movie with Alan Alda, instantly gets better. Britt Robertson was pretty good in this movie too.

This is a movie where I would not go and follow what the critics say because the story while typical of love story movies was a little bit more than it. Don't judge a book by its cover.",1453507200,,682,4.08955223880597

7102374,1,B00VSE0IMM,"Aside from some terrific (if overly-glossy) bull riding sequences, this hodgepodge of romance-novel clichs is riding on empty. Adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' source material (calling it a book would be too charitable), this drama, targeted at lovelorn teenage girls, concerns the turbulent love affair between a handsome professional bull rider and his university girlfriend, which parallels the one between an elderly man (whom they rescued from a car accident!) and his wife in the 1940s. Comparisons to Sparks' ""The Notebook"" are unavoidable, as this is just a pale imitation (with Alan Alda in for James Garner, hardly an upsell). The chemistry between the young lovers suffocates under the plastic handling, while director George Tillman, Jr. takes forever to get us to the finish line.",1451347200,3,791,5.387096774193548

This movie was not an exception.
She was really shined in this movie too.
Plus the story was good too except the flash back of the old man's past.
It's kind of annoying seeing the grandfather's past. I don't know why but the love story of the old man didn't touched my heart that much.
Maybe the acting of two actors.
Anyway, the music and the editing were all good and the story was steady.
Scott Eastwood(Clint Eastwood's son. Not that I knew this till I finished watching it) and Britt Robertson was very charming. They connected with each other beautifully.
It's a good movie to watch and perhaps to own this movie.

PS: There are some nudity and it's beautiful. I think it's ok for PG-13.  But still They are sex scenes.",1450915200,,797,4.414965986394558

7102391,5,B00VSE0IMM,"Watched it on a Premium TV Channel and liked it enough to buy it so I could watch it with my friends. Scott Eastwood was polished and believable, Alan Alda was as good as he has always been and Britt Robertson was refreshingly proficient in her part, which was very hard to pull off given the premise that she had worked all of her life to get the perfect job in the world of art, only to meet a young, handsome bull rider and put her plans aside for him and a shot a love.
However, the entire cast pulled this off with understated acting and believe-ability. Oona Chaplin and Jack Huston played their parts lovingly and had some of the best parts in the movie.
I even liked Britt's friends who were more than supportive of her, as I find people in real life to be, not the usual stab in the back type you see in so many young love movies these days.
I would watch a sequel if one were to be in the offing.
Very clean language, limited adult content and well done at that.",1450656000,12,972,4.148148148148148

The characters had good chemistry and the lines did not make me cringe like many other Sparks films do. I actually found myself enjoying both the stories in the film and the tie-in at the end was a nice twist.

I cannot really fault the writers of the film, they had to stick to the source material to a point and if I am being honest, all of the Sparks novels I have read (maybe 4) they all were pretty predictable even if a funa and easy read.

Well, you won't waste your time if your a fan of Spark's movie adaptations, it is up to snuff for the group. I don't think it is as good an adaptation as say the Notebook or Safehouse, but it does well with the material it has and the actors pull it off.",1444521600,2,572,4.153153153153153

7102743,4,B00VSE0IMM,"For awhile was very disappointed with the Nicholas Sparks movies I have seen. The only one I like is The Notebook,but after I saw this movie I changed my mind. This movie turned out to be a great love story and in the end the main characters actually got to be together. That's my kind of love story. I find that Nicholas Spark's movies the ones I have seen so far anyway have a similar theme where the well to do woman falls for the bad boy,the boy on the wrong side of the tracks,and poor. This movie was a little bit different it was a college student falling for a bull rider who had a very serious accident in the past and needed to stop riding but was to stubborn to do so,but in the end he finally did what he felt was right. The bull rider wasn't a bad boy just a country boy who felt he needed to earn money to keep the family farm and risk his life in the process. This movie focused on two love stories and at times there was a focus on letters just like the Notebook. Alan Alda plays a old man that helps the main characters get together in the end. IHe played his character beautifully by the way and put some humor in the movie which is mostly a serious drama. I  liked how the story focused on two love stories and how the two main characters especially the bull rider realized what was more important in life.",1444348800,,1325,4.115830115830116

7102778,4,B00VSE0IMM,"My surprise was the acting in this movie was superb.  Scott Eastwood is not only handsome but he can perform very nicely.  The movie was delightful and heartwarming.  It moved along slowly, at times, but did not diminish my interest in the story.  The boy in the story is a professional rodeo bull rider and the girl intends to move to NY and open up her own art gallery. They meet a (Jewish) elderly man who just had a bad car accident  and he plays a major role in their lives.  Very touching.......",1444176000,3,501,4.333333333333333

7102906,5,B00VSE0IMM,"Loved this movie! I had read the book, and the movie stayed close to the original story. It seems that many movies rely on other things, like special effects, or random violence to keep interest. It's a rare movie that simply relies on a good story. This story works beautifully in print and on the screen. It is stunning in it's simplicity, and yet at the same time the plot turns keep you guessing the entire way.

I am a risk taker (adrenaline sports), and an artist, so this story resonated with me on many levels. But most powerful of all was the love between the two young people and the old man. This movie had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Don't miss it!",1443744000,3,675,4.232558139534884
7102907,2,B00VSE0IMM,"It's a little long and the mix of the two stories is kind of annoying at times.  The story is unbelievable, but with the fast forward button it is watchable and the actors are good looking.",1443744000,,189,4.25

7102923,5,B00VSE0IMM,"As always, the movie is never as good as the book, but this movie was nothing short of amazing. Nicholas Sparks never disappoints! And neither does his movies!",1443657600,,159,4.714285714285714
7102924,5,B00VSE0IMM,"The Longest Ride was a pretty good movie, it was obvious that Scott Eastwood wasn't actually riding the bulls since the cameras never showed his face when the bull was in the shot, if you check out the extras you'll see that assumption is proven correct where Eastwood learns how to move like  a real rider does on a fake bucking bull contraption but he definitely put the effort in.  The plot is a little predictable in regards to the two, well I thought they were the main characters but they're really just the book ends to a flash back story read by Britt Robertson's character through an old man (MASH""s Alan Alda)'s letters he wrote to his wife over their decades of time together.  Anyway the bull rider who risks death every time he rides a bull due to a previous fall, who has no plans to leave his mother's ranch and the university art student who has plans to pursue an art studio career in New York who catches his eye, is a pretty predictable one.  It's the flashback story that has a bit more depth and unpredictability to it. A young man in the 1940s basically you'd call it stalking today, but he watches an Austrian girl everywhere she goes that he is infatuated with after she came into his mother's store as a customer.  He obviously eventually gets her but World War II plays a hand in blowing away a certain part of him you need to make kids and prior to letting him make his marriage proposal before deployment, she'd let him know she wants lots of kids. Britt Robertson's character will read and take the viewer through the different stages of the old man and his wife's life together, the challenges, the highs and lows.  Meanwhile the bull rider just wants to last eight seconds on a bull and climb the world rankings, which ridiculously you can do in each bull riding competition, even though they never leave the area, let alone the US.  The hot art student wants a relationship with him but had no plans of staying where she only came to attend university due to winning a scholarship.",1443657600,,2013,4.46866485013624
7102925,5,B00VSE0IMM,This was a great movie.  I especially like Eastwood.  He is so much like his Father.  I hope he make many more movies.,1443571200,,118,4.043478260869565

7102987,5,B00VSE0IMM,Nicholas Sparks knocks it out of the park with this one. It may be his best by far. Possibly better than The Notebook. Scott Eastwood is dreamy and the ideal cowboy. Britt Robertson was perfect for Sophia. The casting in this film is not distracting... or an ill fit like some of his other films. I won't spoil it....but it's a must see. Great romantic movie.,1443312000,,359,4.454545454545454

Other reviewers pointed out its faults about the letter writing, etc., however, I chose to  just go with it and enjoy the story. And let's not forget how absolutely yummy Scott Eastwood is.

7103112,4,B00VSE0IMM,"A nice ""date movie"" written by Nicholas Sparks featuring newcomer Britt Robertson (playing Sophia) and Scott Eastwood (as Luke). On the surface it is a story about their relationship and difficulties coming from their different worlds and motivations-- Sophia a city-girl and career-oriented student -- Luke as the country-boy and a competitive Bull Rider.  But what makes the movie a gem is the-story-in-the-story as Robertson and Eastwood learn about love through the lens of old love letters written by Ira (Alan Alda) to his love Ruth (Oona Chaplin) presented in historical flashbacks.  It's a little more of chick-flick than rodeo movie, but there is enough bull-riding in there to balance it out.",1443139200,3,702,5.258928571428571

As Luke is driven to reach the top ranking bull rider in the world at all costs, he meets Sofia who lives in a completely different world of art and college. How could they possibly make this relationship work when their interests were miles apart? When Luke rescues Ira Levinson from a burning car crash, he becomes an integral part of both his and Sofia's lives. I loved the flashbacks to Ira's younger days and his love, Ruth.

The story of a college girl going to a bull riding competition just to get here friend off her back and ending up falling in love with the determined you man both in his wanting to be the champion and winning her love
was well played.  The insertion of Alan Alda's story as he was dying about his wife, his only love, made me understand the real meaning of their
love.  This is a good movie well worth your time to watch. Actually, the bull riding scenes where great the way they focused on the bull more than
the rider.",1442275200,3,742,4.264285714285714

7103375,5,B00VSE0IMM,"As far as Nicholas Sparks novel-to-movies go, The Longest Ride was a breath of fresh air for me. As most young women I love a good cheesy, cliche, sit in bed with a big bowl of ice cream on a rainy fall day romance movie, but I have not seen or felt such a movie since the good old days of A Walk To Remember and The Notebook. Those are the only two (out of the seemingly hundreds) of Nicholas Sparks movies that I could watch over and over again and resonate with me each time, but now I can add this new one to the list.

There are many faults that all these movies have in common, one of the biggest being the believability of the main couple's relationship. Usually it seems shallow, quick, forced, and a number of other things that cause me to never truly ""root"" for them. There were two relationships in this movie, one past one present, and both to me seemed nothing but realistic and completely genuine. The chemistry was undeniable and really made me WANT something similar, as all of the better romance movies do.

The other biggest flaw I usually see in these book to movie adaptations is the choppiness of the derived script. Some movies resort to using voice overs to explain the story, using lines taken from the original manuscript to help the viewer understand what is going on. A movie is visual, and I've always hated the use of voiceovers for something that is supposed to visually tell a story. We are essentially getting a glimpse into someone else's life when watching a movie, but we would never be able to hear their inner monologue to understand what is going on. This again was not the case for The Longest Ride. The story was told through the actions of the actors and a much better written script.

Overall, it's not an Oscar worthy film with deep meanings and messages, but as far as chick flicks go, the acting was very enjoyable and believable, the story was lovable, and tears were obviously shed. It definitely holds its own in its genre and is definitely worth the watch (or several) for any fan of sappy love stories.",1441756800,,2052,4.452127659574468

I am normally very critical when it comes to movies, but this one kept my attention. Scott Eastwood played a great role, anyone else in this role and I think the rating would have to go down.

The only complaint I have comes from the intense ""love"" scene in the middle of the movie, the mood of the whole movie seems to change for about 10 minutes during this part. It doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the movie.

I would definitely recommend that everyone watch this movie!",1441756800,2,643,4.262295081967213

7103755,5,B00VSE0IMM,"This is the best romance movie I have watched in a really, really long time.  However, my husband hated it.  I didn't realize the hunk of a leading man was a child of Clint Eastwood, but it certainly fits.
As my husband phrased it, you somewhat get a 2fer.  Two romances for the price of one. I thought Luke and Sophia's chemistry was fourth of July worthy.  Ira and Ruth were real and an example that marriage is a long hard road and the best we can do is love what we have and not mourn what we do not.
That being said, I doubt many of us experience the passion of Luke and Sophia.  As at least one other reviewer noted, it is nice to see a romance that built over weeks instead over one whirlwind night.
I'll be purchasing this and watching it a few more times.",1440892800,,764,4.100671140939597

7103772,5,B00VSE0IMM,"I loved it!!!  I read the book and loved the book but of course the book went into more detail.  I made such a connection to Alan Aldas Character and his wife Ruth because we were never able to have children and like them have gone on and are having a happy life, married 44 years so far. Clint Eastman's son is just gorgeous and the two of them have good chemistry. This movie made me cry good tears :)",1440892800,,403,4.025

Cheesy line after cheesy line with zero creativity. The best part of the movie was the slow motion snot flying from the bulls mouth and nose. If you do rent this movie just take those parts and re watch them for like 80 minutes and you might have a better opinion of this movie.,1440633600,5,447,4.209302325581396

7104256,5,B00VSE0IMM,It's great because it talks about life and love relationship struggles  but you stay together and work things out. How one kind act can influence someone's  life forever! !! Sometimes you don't realize it but it's a big deal to that person! !!,1439769600,,243,4.627906976744186

That being said, the movie was still very good. The flashback scenes between Ruth and Ira were endearing, and of course the eye candy in the name of Scott Eastwood, made the flick worth watching.",1439769600,5,383,4.485714285714286

I kept getting up and down because I was bored - there are just no redeeming qualities to this movie - and I have always loved Nicolas Sparks.  His movies have never been the most exciting, but they have had a little spark!!  Couldn't find it here.  I say,

If I had not read the book and had expectations for it to follow the story a little more closely I probably would have enjoyed it more. The movie and actors are good; I was just let down by the areas which strayed from the book. The first scene at the rodeo where they meet and leaving out the ex-boyfriend was disappointing-the book was so vivid with the description the fact that the movie leaves it out is terrible for me. The fact that Ira wrecks in the snow during the book and they find him further along versus the rain and on the first date...that let me down. The translations from book to screenplay just lost serious storyline for me. If you haven't read the book then I think you will enjoy the movie.",1439683200,,791,4.245033112582782

7104528,2,B00VSE0IMM,"I loved the book. Listened to the audible version and thought it was great! I really hate that they changed the story so much from the book. I understand changes have to be made for time constraints and visualizations, but this was absurdly different. I don't get the actor choices either. I think Alan Alda is a great actor, but with all of the great Jewish actors available, why not use one to play a Jewish character. Although the book narrator missed the mark at southern accents, Eastwood has none. Again, there are plenty of actors who could have portrayed this character better. I may have been less critical if I had not listened to the book, but I don't think so. The story was rushed and no character development at all.

So, my opinion is that the book was great and the movie not.",1439424000,3,792,4.462068965517242

Very good ending, left you feeling good.",1439251200,,421,4.901408450704225
7104683,2,B00VSE0IMM,"I don't know if I can watch another Nicholas Sparks movie as long as I live. The Notebook was the only movie I can stomach.
How the heck did this movie get so many stars??? After the horror that was The Lucky One, I decided to try to give this movie a chance.

Yes- Scott Eastwood is hunky and good looking. He can smile, stare and squint. Oh, and gaze. Oh, and look sexy. But can he act? I am not really sure. He didn't seem to be given the chance. He was a 2-dimensional character. ""I need to save my farm, so I must ride. That is all I know."" Rinse and repeat. The sexual tension and attraction between the two characters is minimal and forced. The dialogue is basic. The range of emotions is limited.  Alan Alda is reduced to playing a feeble old cute man. I've seen MASH and know his range of acting skills.  The power of the love, tension, reunion that is in the Notebook (and somewhat in his other movies) is no where to be found in this movie.  There is no build up of friendship, attraction nor relationship between the two main characters. This movie tries to take itself WAY too seriously. And it doesn't have the depth of acting to carry it off. It's almost laughable at how upset the female character (Sophia) gets about their relationship and I am wondering, ""why are you so upset? you guys don't even seem to suit each other????""

And the Alan Alda character and his love interest is the same. It's so rushed and the 'angst' is so rushed and glossed over that you miss it. Oh! Where was I supposed to feel anxiety and empathy for the characters. It never hits.

The movie could have done so much with bull riding to get us engaged with the character. Show us the training that goes into this career. Show us how hard the other bull riders put into winning. Show us how the spectators get involved. Better angles of filming. Maybe throw us on the other side of the cage at the bull's eye level. Instead of from above. Show us how hard Sophia's character put into her school work. Just saying, ""I have to study"" isn't enough. Show us the blood sweat and tears that she put into school and getting the internship. So we feel like there is actually a dilemma of choosing b/w her internship and Luke. It just seems whimsical the way it's presented in the film.

This is a movie that you can't watch running the background while you are working because there isn't enough dialogue to keep you in the movie. It's more 'looks' and stares than engaging dialogue.

I think both actors have potential. They just weren't given a chance to show their range of acting skills.

I loved the parts where it took you back in time...and I will say no more so I don't ruin it for others. On a side note: it's nice to know that we have another Eastwood stepping into his father's shoes. This Eastwood seems to be able to move from Rugged to Romantic with relative ease, which is something his father couldn't pull off.",1439164800,8,490,4.223404255319149

7104995,5,B00VSE0IMM,"I confess that I watch Nicholas Sparks movies because my wife makes me, but this time I was surprised and impressed.  The film's plot and setting will be familiar to fans of his other books, but what makes this film special is the character that draws all the others together and transforms their lives: a Jewish woman fleeing Nazi-occupied Vienna, who brings the culture of her city and her love for art to the American South.  I won't give away the story, but she gives the plot depth just as her love of life and art enriches everyone she meets. After you watch this film, quickly watch the film Woman of Gold starring Helen Mirren, which is a non-fiction story of a woman who also fled the center of Vienna's world of art and music after the Nazi Anschluss - the two films are surprisingly complementary.",1438819200,,808,4.527397260273973

7105131,5,B00VSE0IMM,"If you like other Nicolas Sparks stories, you'll love this movie.  It brings about the full range of emotions from laughing out loud to full on tears.  It's a love story within a love story about a bull rider, Luke Collins (Scott Eastwood) who meets Sophia (Britt Robertson) a college student who is passionate about art. They are opposites that totally attract. While on a date, they rescue an elderly gentleman, Ira (Alan Alda), who crashes his car in a rainstorm. Sophia discovers a basket full of wartime love letters written to Ira's wife, Ruth (Oona Chaplin), who also held a passion for art. As Sophia reads the letters to Ira, we are taken back in time.  The love stories between Ira & Ruth as well as Luke & Sophia teach us that love is worth all sacrifices.",1438819200,,767,4.543478260869565

7105222,5,B00VSE0IMM,"I enjoyed this a lot. Good acting overall & a great story... The filming of the bull riding scenes was wonderful.. one in slow motion in particular was terrifying- I find this kind of thing scary to watch. The bull represents for me my blood glucose and trying to control that with type 1 diabetes. I feel sorry for the bulls though, and I don't understand why anyone does this. The story of Ruth and Ira and the child who they lost was touching. This film made me laugh and cry. I will have to read this book- I haven't read any of Nicolas Spark's books although I enjoyed the film made of The Notebook also.  I would have liked to see more character development of the featured couple.",1438560000,,687,4.325581395348837
7105223,3,B00VSE0IMM,"Cheesey. Takes the same lines as the notebook. I also saw similar romantic clips and blurbs taken from dear john (novel). Nothing will compare to the notebook. In the notebook, Gosling and mcadams are just so passionate. Sadly, I'm not sure any modern day romantic movie will ever compare to The Notebook. I wasn't a big fan of the country bull riding theme.

7105229,1,B00VSE0IMM,"A wonderful book by Nicholas Sparks that died in the making of the film.  Britt Robertson/ Sophia is a giddy, giggling little girl who in no way fulfills the role of the Sophia in the book.  Who in the world did the casting?!!  Scott Eastwood was believable and did a good job in his role; I especially applaud him since his ""love interest"" acted like a 13 year old.  ""The Notebook "" is the only Nicholas Sparks book made into a film that I felt was on the mark with the actors chosen.
My friends and I so looked forward to this movie last night and kept thinking it would get better as it progressed.  WRONG!  Washing the dinner dishes held more intrigue and entertainment.  Whoever is working with Nicholas Sparks in making his books into movies should be fired!  A great writer with less than amateur movie makers.",1438473600,6,817,4.436241610738255

My only experience with her acting prior to this movie was in Under The Dome and I thought she was horrible in that show.  But her acting in this movie really changed my opinions and I thought she did a really good job.  It's not the best movie in the world but compared to The Lucky One, Dear John or Nights in Rodanthe this movie was pretty good.",1438214400,,590,4.318181818181818

7105559,5,B00VSE0IMM,"This movie was fantastic! As a rule, I always read the book before I watch the movie and I'm glad I did because the movie was actually very different from the book. Without giving away the plot to anyone who doesn't know the story, some of the events took place at a different time in the movie and this threw me off a bit. However, as I think about it, it ended up being the best way to tell the story. Obviously the book contains a lot more details but the movie did a fairly good job of telling the same story. I loved the actors and feel that they played their parts well. The story was very emotional, which is Nicholas Sparks' signature style, and I cried numerous times, either from the bits of sadness to the tears of joy. I loved both the book and the movie a lot and will definitely read/watch them again, which is very rare for me. Whether you are a Nicholas Sparks fan or not, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a beautiful love story!",1437868800,5,963,4.210810810810811

This could have been the shortest review Ive written. All I had to do was say that The Longest Ride is based on a novel by romance writer Nicholas Sparks, and everyone would get the picture.

Sparks audience is and has always been primarily women, and the movie adaptations of his books have fallen into the category of chick flicks. Thats not bad, mind you, but the reality-check is that families with adolescent and teenage girls are more likely to fall for this opposites-attract love story than families with boys. Thats just the way it is, and its not a slam. Sparks has written 18 romance novels, and 11 of them (including Message in a Bottle, The Notebook, and Dear John) have been turned into films. Theyre tremendously popular.

This one falls right in the middle, in terms of worldwide gross, but its decent enough entertainment if you're into romance. The plot is a two-strand weave that involves two couples.

Romantic comedies always have a meet cute, and though this isn't a comedy, thats how it works. Wake Forest college student Sophia Danko (Britt Robertson) is coerced by her sorority sisters into donning cowboy boots and going to a rodeo to check out the beef. When Lukewho was seriously injured a year earlier and is still emotionally scarred as a resultfalls off a bull right in front of her and loses his hat, she tosses it to him . . . and he tosses it back. Keep it, he says. Eye contact. Later they meet at a party where shes just about to accept a drink with him but has to cut the evening short because of a friend who drank too much. Yep, theres drinking and implied sex in this film, though the nudity we see is full-body without full reveal, hence the PG-13 rating.

They start to see each other, but an otherwise ordinary love story is given another layer when they come across an accident. Luke (Scott EastwoodClints youngest son) pulls the man out, while Sophia goes back at the mans request to retrieve a box. Sparks has never been bashful about using plot devices, and this ones a doozy. With a curious Sophia reading the love letters contained in the box, Sparks sets up a double love storyone in the past, with the woman (Oona Chaplin) deceased and the man (Alan Alda) on life support, and the other a young couple just trying to find someone. Sparks and director George Tillman, Jr. (Soul Food, Barbershop) do a nice job of pacing the reveals and relationship development, and a surprise-but-inevitable ending ties that neat bow that romance lovers have come to expect on every package.

In between there are some exciting and wonderfully filmed bull riding sequences, and the stars are plenty likablewhich is really important in a formulaic romance, so that we care about their characters and their outcomes. It also looks great in HD, with a bundle of bonus features that should appeal to fans.

Language: Surprisingly little. Maybe a few s-words but thats about it
Sex: A number of sex scenes, with one brief breast shot and a brief mens top half of a butt shown. Also plenty of talk about sex.
Violence: Not much. Really just the bull riding sequences and the car crash
Adult situations: Drinking, smoking, partying, etc.
Takeaway: Youre doomed to repeat the past, unless you can learn from someone elses past. Oh, and love is timeless.

7105788,5,B00VSE0IMM,"The Longest Ride, based on the best selling novel by Nicholas Sparks, has just released on Blu-ray from Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment.

Director George Tillman Jr. does a fantastic job of bringing this love story to the screen. (And staying true to the book)

Bullrider Luke (Scott Eastwood) is 'back in the saddle' trying to return to the top of his sport after an injury, when he meets Sophia (Britt Robertson) - a college student ready to graduate and pursue her dream job in the art field. When the two meet, sparks fly - but can love overcome dreams and ambitions? What, if any, choices and sacrifices will each be willing to make?

What makes The Longest Ride such a wonderful film to watch is the parallel story set in the 1940's. Luke and Sophia rescue Ira (Alan Alda) an older man and his box of letters from a car crash. Sophia continues to meet with Ira and from her letter reading we relive the love story of Ira and his wife Ruth. (Oona Chaplin is fantastic as young Ruth. Jack Huston is young Ira) The two stories mirror each other across the generations, through good and bad, only serving to illustrate that love takes sacrifice and the path to happiness is never smooth.

Watching The Longest Ride is going to make you happy though. Who doesn't love a love story? Great sets and scenery, a perfectly cast group of actors, some tastefully done steamy scenes, lots of action in the bull ring and an ending that's just right, all add up to a sweet, satisfying movie night at home. The Longest Ride is perfect to share with that special someone in your life or maybe as a girl's night at the movies. (As one supporting character says early on ""I want a cowboy."" Uh huh.)

Tillman took great care with realistically portraying the bull riding. Two of the special features on the disc follow Eastwood's training as well as the real riders. Fascinating stuff. There's also some good interviews with cast members, director and Sparks as well.

The title refers to the eight seconds a rider must stay on the bull to score, but The Longest Ride is also a nod to relationships - staying the course through a bumpy ride as well. Well worth watching for this movie lover!",1437609600,,2186,4.563775510204081

It certainly could have gone into more detail in the character development. I was really surprised to see Alan Alda in this movie and he gave a good performance too.

7106109,5,B00VSE0IMM,"Perfectly Cast.  Beautifully Written.  Very Endearing Film.  This is it.  That movie that will stay with you long after you've watched it.  A story that will pull on your heart strings till you cry, yet leave you with this amazing Legacy from a Love that was constantly sacrificed for.  I have enjoyed Nicolas Sparks' material in the past, but am often disappointed with his endings.  There is no disappointment in this movie.  They got the casting right on this one and the chemistry between Britt and Scott in these roles instantly pulls the viewer into the storyline.  It's one of The Best ""Chick Flicks"", but there seems to be enough in it that guys would like it too.  Alan Alda is masterful as Ira Levinson and the way that the 2 love stories are intertwined is fabulous.  This is by far one of Sparks' best works.  Absolutely an artfully, well thought out and skillfully crafted story with such an authentic feel and an easily believed depth to the characters.  The picture of marriage was beautiful because the characters, despite the challenges, despite the hurt, despite the disappointment, they continued to Choose Love.  This movie will remain one that I will re-watch again and again for years.",1437523200,,1207,4.796116504854369

I actually liked the ending, it ended on a good note.  And to think I wasn't even going to watch this movie, I didn't think it looked like something I would really like, let alone add to my list of favorites!  If you like Sparks movies, make sure you watch this one, I don't think you will be sorry you did.",1437436800,,642,4.245901639344262

In some ways Scott is a better actor than his father, but then again, my love for Clint Eastwood movies will not allow for that. Let me just say two things: (1) If you love Clint Eastwood genre movies, this is a definite watch and (2) do not listen to any low rating, for it will be from an anal-retentive reviewer, who is more critical than lover of good movies.

This is the message given by elders who have seen more, and who have lived complete lives in testament to this truth.
Yes, the resolution given by Ira's will is somewhat contrived and could have gone disastrously wrong if someone else had bought Ruth's painting, but the happy ending is something you feel that Luke and Sophia deserve.",1437177600,2,511,4.752808988764045

I thought it was about Bull Riding .

However, I think they worked extremely well for this story. Both the book and movie brought tears to my eyes and the chemistry between the two actors was great. I think the problem with turning books into movies is people have their expectation of the book and the movie doesn't always meet their expectations. In my opinion, the way they changed some of the things to fit a movie plot was absolutely perfect. I loved it!",1436832000,,575,4.485714285714286

7106614,4,B00VSE0IMM,"I haven't read the book.
I had no idea I would need tissues for the movie. If I read the book, I would have known.
This film is very reminiscent of The Notebook, which I absolutely loved!
The story went between the present day, and a couple who are new to each other. That early not-sure-but-think-I'm-in-love phase. Then it flipped to Alan Alda's part in the movie where he would read his letters or tell stories from the past, remembering his love affair with his wife. Really, those were the best bits of the movie.
It was even more special watching the movie with my husband. Since we are newlyweds, it was super romantic, and that is probably why I cried so much. Such beautiful scenes.
Even the hubby said it was good and cute. That's when you know it is a good one, when he likes it.",1436659200,3,790,4.344594594594595

7106813,5,B00VSE0IMM,"I figured it was a Sunday afternoon and what the heck, let's watch this movie. I'm so glad I did. Fantastic, sweet, lovely, a very tiny bit of action, and a wonderful story. It is a love story and it did bring a tear to my eye. Scott Eastwood is ever so handsome and spot on for his character. He knows how to put the romance in cowboy without being hokey or stereotyped. Britt Robertson is a perfect match for Eastwood as she she shows us maturity and vulnerability, again, without being in a hokey romance movie. Alan Alda also gives this movie credibility with his experience and story telling. Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin also did a wonderful job as the back in time couple. They both know how to do a good period piece. This was such a sweet, non-sappy romance movie. It would be good for date night as it's nothing embarrassing and it has a great story line that maybe might turn your date night into a lifetime. We can all learn a lesson on love and sacrifice and this movie reminds us.",1435449600,,994,4.320855614973262
7106814,1,B00VSE0IMM,"This movie has a few minutes of bull rider cowboy romance. The entire movie is a Second World War movie of a Jewish couples love story and a tribute to Alan Alda. It is too bad because the bull rider romance movie (as represented in the previews) would have been great and had two great actors. They suck you in with the photos of the cowboy and girlfriend, yet they play a tiny bit part of the movie. Total misrepresentation.",1435363200,15,426,4.3375
7106825,5,B00VSE0IMM,"This newest Nicholas Sparks film based on the book is elevated by the amazing acting of veteran actor Alan Alda (Ira Levinson) along with this leading couple. This movie worked for me in so many ways with its title, ""The Longest Ride"" paralleling dual stories. The opening story is based on a champion bull rider, Luke Collins (Scott Eastwood, son of Clint Eastwood) who must remain atop a bull that desperately fights to remove him for an eight-second stretch that is more like an eternity. He quickly spies in the audience a much different and more serious type young woman in Sophia Danko (Britt Robertson). He is immediately enamored with her as she is ""nothing like everybody else""

After meeting at the event, he gives her a ride home while coming up on a bad accident involving an elderly man, Ira Levinson (Alan Alda) and gets him help immediately while Sophia saves a basket from his car that he cannot help repeating about bringing it with them, almost incoherently. Sophia goes to visit him during his recovery and it begins to be a daily ritual while the two grow an endearing and lasting friendship. The story which comes through the letters being read is about a young Ira (Jack Huston) starting in nineteen forty and his love, Ruth (Oona Chaplin). She was also an avid art lover like Sophia and schoolteacher. Like every marriage, it mirrored the difficulties in life but also was infused with so much love that Alda was able to easily master. The more I heard of Ira and Ruth, the more I wanted to know about them. What made them able to get through the difficult times? How did they handle their differences? As their personal story was tied to Sophia and Luke's relationship while these two were falling in love. Ira's story was contagious in the way he told it and in the obvious ways he felt it as he spoke makes it all the more infectious.

The biggest problem for the younger couple is their individual dreams for their own lives and how they could possibly blend them together; they just couldn't seem to find a way with plans being so different. One has to see if they can rectify this. For me, this is one of the better Nicholas Sparks stories coming to film in a while. The scenery (David Tattersall) is lovely; from dense trees with the mists sleeping atop them, life on the ranch to Ira's life with Ruth. A great country based music soundtrack (Mark Isham) keeps the feel of this movie as fresh as it is. Director George Tillman Jr. holds this all up from the Sparks novella with a lesson in the true meaning of unconditional love; ""Love requires sacrifice, always"" - the elder Ira reminds Sophia. He conveys this with all he has to say, do and show the younger couple with his own life. A truly enjoyable watch, again ...",1435363200,8,2750,4.564777327935222

7106830,5,B00VSE0IMM,"Scott Eastwood, son of Clint, is a great leading male actor, and Britt Robertson is a great leading female.  Both of the actors are in their 20s and share a chemistry with each other which is far more appealing (to me) than most romantic movies involving young couples.  This is also a more mature and thoughtful romance movie than many.  In this movie, she wants to go into art, particularly contemporary art, and he has a career as a rodeo performer.  They fall in love slowly enough that its believable and meaningful, rather than in one sudden lustful scene like so many movies do.  While I find one scene of implied sex unnecessary (and prefer it happen after marriage), I really enjoy the way their relationship develops.  They become influenced by the life story of a man played by Alan Alda, who learned the meaning of sacrificial love and imparts this experiential wisdom to them.  The parallels between Aldas characters story and their story give the movie a meaningful connection between past and present.  It is also a rewarding experience when they are both willing to give up selfishness for each other in the movie's resolution.  The editing could have been done poorly, but instead it turned out to be some of the smoothest flashback scenes Ive seen in a while.  (Woman in Gold is the other movie Ive seen lately which has great flashback scenes.  Saving Mr. Banks, on the other hand, has flashback scenes which feel like they make the movie choppy and like its two separate movies.)  I really like the persona Scott Eastwood puts on the screen and hope he goes on to have more roles with this level of charisma, as I think he's on the level of classic Hollywoods leading men such as Clark Gable.  He and she are well matched in this movie, and unlike most romantic movies, trust develops at a gradual pace before physical intimacy.  Well-written, well-edited, well-acted, and stimulating, this movie is enjoyable.",1432771200,226,1930,4.756756756756757

It sorta reminds me of The Notebook, but different and better in the fact that the relationships are modern day, and 1940's era, and it is cool to see how the relationships are similar and connect.

7106840,5,B00VSE0IMM,"Another great love story from Nicholas Sparks.  This one was written and portrayed similar to The Notebook and The Best of Me, in that he takes you from current day to a story-line from years earlier.  However, in The Longest Ride the stories between modern day love and yesterday's love are not about the same people.  The modern day couple takes in the love from another time, as the older couple's love story plays out through letters read, and learns about what is important in their own budding love story.  A different perspective on the same ""love of a lifetime"" love story.",1430006400,8,581,4.666666666666667

Honestly, I only saw this because my wife wanted to. I am not a big fan of the other Nicolas Sparks movies like The Notebook, Lucky One, Best Of Me, etc. My main problem with those is that to me they are unbelievable. There is always the original boyfriend who is the worst person ever, and when a new man shows up he is instantly a better father, fixes cars, boats, builds houses and does everything possible to make a normal person look bad. I say that because this movie, to me, was the best Sparks movie so far. The movie was relate-able and actually not a chore to watch. That is a hard thing for chick-flicks to accomplish. Overall, the best Sparks movie I have seen, and as a man I have to say I did enjoy it and recommend this as a great date movie. My wife loved it as well.

7106843,2,B00VSE0IMM,"""Love is sacrifice, always. The seemingly profound nugget of sappy wisdom is apparently the point of The Longest Ride, the latest in a never-ending line of Nicholas Sparks romance adaptations. And it will prove to be an excruciating truth for guys who are dragged by their significant others to endure this sudsy, predictable film about two generations of star-crossed lovers. That's right, you get two banal love stories for the price of one, and yet it hardly feels like a bargain.

Clint Eastwood's son, Scott, leads the film and you won't be allowed to forget how much he looks like his old man. George Tillman Jr., another respectable director doing mediocre work for some of that Sparks cash, simply can't stop shooting every contour of Eastwood's body and mug. We get it. He even does that little squint like his old man when he's trying to look serious. The news Eastwood is often shirtless and mugging for the camera probably just sold a few more tickets. You're welcome, studio bean-counters!

The Longest Ride has all of the trademarks we've come to expect from a Sparks romance. Sun-kissed North Carolina skies, hunky old-fashioned dudes who always know how to treat a lady, and women who seem to be just waiting for the right guy to come along. They never have anything else going on worth a damn. Eastwood plays Luke Collins, the manliest man of all because he's a champion bull-rider with a great smile, a cowboy hat, and a rusty pickup truck. All he's missing is his own ranch. Oh wait; he has one of those, too. After suffering a near-fatal injury at the horns of the mighty bull Rango (who is portrayed as evil incarnate), Luke takes time off only to return a year later. It's then that he tips his hat towards Sophia (Britt Robertson), a studious art student on the verge of a career-making internship in New York. You'll be shocked to learn their obvious differences, he's a country boy and she's a city girl, is only a momentary issue. Soon they're on the perfect first date, having a picnic by the riverside.

The date takes a nasty but ultimately fortuitous turn when they find a crashed car on the road. Inside they find injured 91-year-old Ira Levinson (Alan Alda) and quickly pull him to safety. Sophia also retrieves a box that turns out to be old letters Ira wrote to his deceased wife, Ruth. While helping him recover in the hospital, Sophia reads him the letters, flashing back to the 1940s when young Ira and Ruth (played by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin, both descendants of Hollywood royalty) were just becoming lovers.

It turns out the most effective aspects of The Longest Ride all involve Ira and Ruth's troubled relationship, and that should come as no surprise given the strength of the actors and the emotional weight they are forced to carry. The older couple has to deal with Ira's fighting in WWII, where he suffers an injury that affects his ability to father children. Since they both desperately want to be parents, the strain on their marriage, and the sacrifices they make to stay together, are genuinely affecting. But it also makes Sophia and Luke's problems slight by comparison. Can she set aside her art career to work on a ranch the rest of her life? Can he quit a dangerous career as a bull-rider to be a safe, loving husband? Oh, the drama of it all! These unequal love stories would have been better served in two separate movies. You can sense screenwriter Craig Bolotin's desperate flailing to connect them emotionally during one of Sparks' classic ""twist"" endings where something completely unbelievable happens out of nowhere. In Safe Haven a major character was revealed to have been a dead spirit the entire time. Nothing quite on that level happens here, but its still bullcrap enough that Rango might have left it on the bottom of Luke's boot. Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.",1429315200,10,3892,4.727540500736377
7106844,4,B00VSE0IMM,"I really like Nicholas Sparks movies, and also I'm a Britt Robertson fan so I knew I couldn't miss this one!
The movies from these author are a little formulatic now, but with ""The Longest Ride"" I actually didn't cared. The film show us how two young adults fall in love but with some complications in between; with risks for the male character, Luke, and an already planned future for the lead female character, Sophia, the situations that happen on movie put to test their instant love. There's also another love story: Ira and Ruth. At first this story looks so different to the main one, but as the story goes, the connection about fighting for love, sacrifices, connects both stories perfectly. That's the thing I love about this movie: two love stories in one film.
If you like romantic/drama films, ""The Longest Ride"" will be the perfect film to you, you laugh, you cry, and you actually see the chemistry between the two main characters, you believe all the lines. The cinematography is also great, the North Carolina scenery is perfect for the film. As I said the film is a little formulatic (and of course the ending is formulatic too), but the film is enjoyable and worth the movie ticket you paid for, and I really hope to see Britt Robertson shining on more movies with lead roles, because she did it perfectly on this one!",1428710400,7,1336,4.617647058823529
