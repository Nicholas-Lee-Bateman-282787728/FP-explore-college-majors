Songs are Sounds, Emily, Surprises, A World Around You, Determination, Patience is a Virtue, Ode to Gordon, Engine Roll Call

Stories are Thomas and the Tuba and Thomas and the Firework Display.

2211597,3,B0007GP78C,"My 2 year old son loves this DVD. That is after getting it started. It has the worst menu. You have no power as to escaping it. It is boring. You just have to wait till it is over, no matter what button you push on your remote. But, the songs are great ;)",1247184000,,255,3.740740740740741
2211598,5,B0007GP78C,"I have two sons (32 months old and 15 months old). I realized my sons liked the songs more than the stories in our other DVDs, so I decided to get a DVD with bunch of songs (most have just one or two) and it was a hit. They really enjoy watching the songs (much more so than the stories).",1224288000,6,288,3.816666666666667
2211599,1,B0007GP78C,"I bought this for my 17 month old to watch when we're riding in the car. He normally loves all of the Thomas episodes.  To my surprise, however, there are some incredibly violent and disturbing images in the DVD.  In particular, everytime the ""Surprises"" song would play, my toddler would begin to cry and act very distressed.  After I viewed it, I understand why it upset him.  There are images of crashing trains, runaway trains, large snowballs running over cars and people, and even two scenes with a snowman's head falling off.  I do not recommend this DVD, particularly not for toddlers.",1220918400,9,593,4.7745098039215685

2211602,5,B0007GP78C,My 18 month old got this in his Easter Basket and loves it!  He is too young to really enjoy the Thomas & Friends TV show....at his age it just doesn't keep his attention for very long.  He loves music & sing alongs so this DVD can really keeps his attention.  The music in this DVD is really good too.  The one we purchased came with a Silver 60th Anniversary Percy train that my toddler likes to drive on the coffee table while watching the video.,1176854400,2,449,4.186046511627907
2211603,4,B0007GP78C,"For fans of the Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends series, HIT Entertainment brings you a DVD of pure train action, including eight sing-along songs and two stories.

SONGS:

Sounds

Emily

Surprises

A World Around You

Determination

Patience is a Virtue

Ode to Gordon

Engine Roll Call

STORIES:

Thomas and the Tuba

Thomas and the Firework Display

The songs and stories are all from Season Eight, for those keeping &#8220;track&#8221;, and are shown as music videos, complete with bouncing puffs of steam for those kiddie karaoke sessions.

As is the case with many Thomas DVDs, some editions are packaged with a model train and some aren't.  This one does not include the model train, but does have some bonus features.

If there's a Thomas fan in your house you'll need to get this one, but it's not recommended as a first buy for newbies.

2211604,5,B0007GP78C,My toddler is addicted to all of the song videos.  They are much more exciting than the stories in my opinion.  He has had this video since he is 1 1/2 and as we are approaching 3 he shows no signs of growning tired of it!,1142467200,10,222,3.8043478260869565

2211606,3,B0007GP78C,"This, I believe, is the third compilation video of Thomas music videos. Usually, I like music videos but these ones weren't nearly as good. They just aren't very catchy, in fact, the only one I liked was ODE TO GORDON. On the other hand, both of the stories(THOMAS AND THE TUBA, THOMAS AND THE FIREWORKS DISPLAY) are good. No I wouldn't recommend this video, only if your a true Thomas fan.",1118188800,4,390,4.507042253521127
