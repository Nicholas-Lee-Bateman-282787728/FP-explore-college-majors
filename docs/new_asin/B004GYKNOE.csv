8429072,1,B004GYKNOE,The cover photo and title is very misleading. There is nothing remotely sexy or scary about this film. It's just a couple of very ugly people running around with a handheld camera and acting like morons. Fourth graders taking a cell phone video would do a better job.,1394928000,4,267,4.583333333333333
8429073,3,B004GYKNOE,"Okay ... I will be honest with you ... I expected this to suck.

But, I was pleasantly surprised by the craft and ingenuity the filmmaker(s)used in this ""filmlett"". Now don't expect anything like a real movie here. This is what we used to call an experimental film. Parts of it reminded me of the bizarre world David Lynch created in ERASERHEAD. I don't want to give any of it away, but the craft is in the melding of cool public domain films, sound tricks, and an inspired use of silent film technique. There is also a cool combination of jump cuts and long static scenes that make for a very effective feeling of dread.

Now, having said all this, I don't want to give the casual viewer the wrong idea. If you're looking for a scary movie to watch with some friends, this isn't it. But if you're interested in what can be done on a very limited budget these days I can recommend it wholeheartedly.

Long Live Creeperson.

8429074,1,B004GYKNOE,"At first I was upset a bit that I saw it was only 50 minutes long. Then as I started watching it I thought that this movie is way too long!

There was about 10 minutes that I thought was funny and worth watching -- the scene of him talking to his fantasy girl with the drawn on stitches. Her silent movie type dialogue was pretty funny. Otherwise I agree with the ""this movie blows"" review.

The joejoedancer review who gave it 5 stars - must be smoking crack and/or thinks they are cool by liking such an ""avant-garde"" film, which it is not.

Creepersin - get a life!",1346198400,4,568,4.192660550458716
