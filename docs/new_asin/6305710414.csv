1062326,5,6305710414,"This PPV was great! It opened up with Edge and Christian vs. DX (Road Dogg & X-Pac) for the Tag Team Titles. Next was Dean Malenko vs. Scotty 2 Hotty for the Light Heavyweight Title. The Acolytes faced the Big Bossman  and Bull Buchanan in a match that was a complete waste of time. In an  excellent 6-way Hardcore Match, Crash Holly defended his Hardcore belt  against Perry Saturn, Tazz, Hardcore Holly, Matt Hardy, and Jeff Hardy.  Kurt Angle faced against The Big Show, who was imatating Hulk Hogan, in an  OK match. T & A faced the Dudley Boyz in an OK match, and Buh Buh Ray  finally puts Trish Stratus through a table. Eddy Guerrero puts his European  title on the line against Essa Rios in a cool match. Chris Benoit vs. Chris  Jericho for the IC belt was excellent, although the ending should have been  better. Finally, Triple H defends the WWF title against The Rock, with  Shane McMahon as the referee. Stone Cold returns for one night only during  this match, and that would be a good enough reason to buy this PPV.",963100800,3,1028,4.44385026737968

Match by Match  Reviews(Universal Match rating system goes from DUD being the worst to  ***** being the best)
Edge/Christion vs DX - Good action with tremendous  crowd heat. ***1/4
Dean Malenko vs Scott Taylor - Superb match, great  pacing and finish. ****1/4 hopefully the WWF continues the Light Weight  Division
Bull & Bossman vs Acolytes - Nothing really redeeming about  this match, didn't belong on a PPV. 1/4 of a *
Hardcore 6 way - Very  entertaining, good work on the part of all of the participants. ***
Kurt  Angle vs the Showster - One of the funniest things I have ever seen. Show  has the Hogan impersonation down perfectly, he even cuts a hoganisc promo.  Match Sucked though DUD
T&A vs Dudleys - Decent match, inconsistant  crowd heat though. ** Trish gets tabled afterwards, which she took very  well
Eddie Guerrero vs Essa Rios - Rios is still very green. He blows a  spot early, but after that it picks up and gets really good. ***1/2
Chris  Benoit vs Chris Jericho - Great effort on the part of both men, not as good  as their 1995 Super J Cup match, but still exellent. Ending could have used  a little work though. ****1/4
Triple H vs The Rock - Good Match, not  great though. Too much resting and a little too screwy for my tastes. It  was great seeing Austin back and raising hell, even if it was only one  night. The match gets ***1/2, but it is worth seeing just for seeing Austin  come back and start whacking people with a chair.

1062328,5,6305710414,"Backlash was one of the greatest pay-per-view events the WWF have ever produced. From a wrestling standpoint the card was flawless. However some matches do stand out above others, for instance, the WWF Light-Heavyweight  Championship match between Dean Malenko and Scotty Too Hotty was excellent,  especially when you consider the fact that this match had very little hype  coming into the event. The Intercontinental Championship match between  Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho was an instant classic. The European  Championship match between Eddie Guererro and Essa Rios was an excellent  high-flying match. And of course you had the incredible main event between  Triple H and The Rock for Helmsley's WWF Championship, no matter how many  times they wrestle each other, The Rock and Triple H always have a good  match. If you haven't seen this event, I suggest you buy it.",960595200,2,873,5.178571428571429
1062329,5,6305710414,... HBK wasn't at this event and there was NO Hell in the Cellmatch between The Rock and Mick Foley. The Main Event was Triple Hwith Vince McMahon in his corner vs. The Rock with Stone Cold Steve Austin in his corner. Shane McMahon was also the Special Guest Referre. Other matches were Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit for the Intercontinental Championship and Scotty Too Hotty vs. Dean Malinko for the Light-Heavyweight title. And MANY more GREAT matches. This is the best PPV of 2000 so far! I would really reccomend this tape to anyone. I won't tell you who won the matches because it would give all the excitement away. But this tape is awesome and I think it is a must buy for any WWF fan!,957312000,,693,4.421875

April 30, 2000

MCI Center

Washington D.C.

WWF Tag Team Championship:

Edge & Christian (Champion) V. Road Dogg & X-Pac

Good choice for the opener. It really got the crowd into it. Edge & Christian retain. ***1/2

WWF Light Heavyweight Championship:

Deam Malenko (Champion) V. Scotty 2 Hotty

This is Scotty's best singles match and probably best match ever. Great backand forth action with only a couple minutes of boring action. This is one of my favorite matches. Great, Great match with the IceMan Dean Malekno retaining. ***3/4 This was the best Lightheavyweight Championship match ever!

Big Bossman & Bull Buchanan V. The Acolytes

ok match. It's very weird watching matches with Bradshaw in then from around this time period. I think he has gotten better in the ring and character wise. However, he's not a main eventer. However, I did start to like him in his later months as WWE Champion even though some of the matches and endings to those matches weren't that good. Anyways...Big & Bull win. **3/4

WWF Hardcore Championship:

Crash Holly (Champion) V. Tazz V. Perry Saturn V. Hardcore Holly V. Matt Hardy V. Jeff Hardy

Great match. There were some great hits and misses in this match also alot of action. When the Hardyz get a ladder from under the ring, gets one of the biggest pops of the night! Weird. JR even mentions this. Crash retains the title after getting his ass kicked the whole match. ***3/4

Kurt Angle V. Big Show

The Hulkster returns to the WWF! Oh, Wait...It's not the Hulkster...It's the Showster! This match maybe not be the best match but it was pretty damn funny. Show sounds just like Hogan! It's great. Angle does get some good wrestling in but Show just destroys him and picks up the win. 3/4*

Dudley Boyz V. Tes & Albert

Oh baby...Trish...oh....umm...sorry. I got distracted there for a minutes. This match was good, but could have been....Trish...oh, sorry again. This match was good but could have been better. Test & Albert win. ***

WWF European Championship:

Eddie Guerrero (Champion) V. Essa Rios

Someone call Reagan Airport in Washington. Great high-flying match with some...well...great high-flying moves. Eddie retains. ****

WWF Intercontinental Championship:

Chris Benoit (Champion) V. Chris Jericho

Awesome wrestling. No, really, I didn't know that. I can watch these two wrestle all night. Cheap ending with Benoit winning by DQ after headbutting the Intercontinental Championship belt, however, still great wrestling. ****1/4

WWF Championship:

Triple H (Champion) V. The Rock

Great match. however, it seems too short for a WWF Championship Match and it was one sided with the Rock getting little offense in. (Yes, I know that is was suppose to look like it was one sided). Austin returns and costs Triple H the WWF Title! ****

Overall, a very, very good show. Great performances all around.",1124236800,,2873,4.9789915966386555

1062483,5,6305710414,"I have seen many WWE pay-per-views over the years, and Backlash 2000 is definately one of the better ones that I have seen. For the most part, the card is extremely well rounded. The best match of the night is obviously Triple H vs The Rock for the WWE title. Both The Rock and Triple H put on a great performance. Then to top things off, Austin returns in this match to one of the biggest crowd pops I have ever heard in my life. The IC Title match between Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit was absolutely outstanding. Jericho and Benoit are argulably two of the greatest technical wrestlers alive today. They have faced each other on many occasions, and I have never seen them put on a bad match. They have very good chemistry together in the ring. Perhaps the most entertaining match of the night was The Big Show vs Kurt Angle. The Big Show came out dressed up as Hulk Hogan and called himself The Showster. His impression is dead on by the way, and I was laughing extremely hard. Other stand out matches include the Hardcore title match featuring 7 different competitors, and T&A vs The Dudley Boyz.
Overall, Backlash was one of the best PPV's put on by the WWE in the year 2000, and almost every match on the card was enjoyable. If you are a WWE fan, this is definately a PPV that you should add to your collection.",1078099200,2,1318,4.361788617886178
1062484,3,6305710414,"Well, since WWE has kicked the 'F' out of their name and introducing more wrestling to the shows and outstanding matches on PPV. I have come back to watch Backlash 2000 and found it very interesting that everyone was giving this show a 4 rating and higher. This is a pay per view that was basically all focused on the main event and the return of Austin (which was planned real nicely, I should add) and the undercard was filled with lackluster non-rocketbuster match-ups. Please do not look at the other reviews from the past because my review is in 2003 and I have since then seen much better PPV's and matches that would blow this out of the water.
1. WWF Tag Team Title Match - Edge & Christian vs. Road Dogg & X-Pac with Tori. This match was fairly good but these are nowhere comparable to the matches I see on Smackdown every week with Los Guerreros and Team Angle, not to mention Edge and Christians other infamous matches involving Tables, Ladders, and Chairs. Debra comes out first and does the ring introductions, why? Have no damn clue, I guess it was just a way to show her beautiful puppies, which by the way looked great tonight overshadowed by her whole great outfit - Nevertheless, Debra looked HOT tonight! Anyway, lucky her looks were up to par because her ringside introductions were not. She has an annoying voice that didn't help her introduce these men, something that WWE found out with Stacey Keibler when she was used as the ring introducer for when WCW was used in the main event of Raw - Remember? Booker T vs. Buff Bagwell - UGH!... Anyway, back to the match, X-Pac looks great here tonight, this was before he just quit trying to impress and entertain the audience. I give the match a 3/5.
2. WWF Light Heavyweight Title Match: Dean Malenko vs. Scotty Too Hotty. Before ECW went bankrupt, Before WCW was sold, Before the Invasion, Before Tajiri, Rey Mysterio, Billy Kidman, Shannon Moore, Chavo Guerrero, Before the Cruiserweight Division would kick-started and the Light heavyweight Division was revamped, This match was said to have been the best WWF Light Heavyweight Championship match. Well, knowing this and that Stone Cold returned on this night, along with the Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho match - I Bought the video. These 3 reasons I bought this damn event on WWF Home Video. This match was... Horrid and I am ashamed at everyone who thought this match was great. This match was so below par to what NWA: TNA is doing with the X-Division, what WCW did with their Cruiserweight Division and even what WWE is doing with their Cruiserweight Division, now. Dean Malenko, ""A Man of a Thousand Moves"", couldn't even carry Scotty 2 Hotty to a half-way decent match. This is a cruiserweight match that consisted of 3 cruiserweight moves - A Variation Arm Drag - Done right away to start the match. 2. A Tiger Driver - Done by Dean Malenko half-way threw the match. 3. A Top Rope DDT to finish the match. Dean Malenko put on some incredible matches with Chris Benoit and Eddie Guerrero, not to mention his great matches with Rey Mysterio, jr. Doesn't make any sense to me. 2/5.
3. Big Boss Man & Bull Buchanan vs. Acolytes. On the VHS, this match is billed as the first match of the evening. Well, it's actually the third match on the tape. Read who's in the match. Argh - Ditto. 1.5/5
4. WWF Hardcore Title Match: Champion Crash Holly vs. Tazz vs. Perry Saturn vs. Hardcore Holly vs. Hardy Boyz. Thank God for this match, this was a very fun and entertaining Hardcore Title match, of course this title is no longer apart of the WWE anymore, along with the Light Heavyweight Title, European Championship and Intercontinental Championship but this match was still great. It's sad seeing one of the best Champions ever, Taz(z), being downgraded a few weeks into his WWF mainstay. 3.5/5
5. ""The Showster"" Big Show vs. Kurt Angle. The Big Show is pretty hilarious in this match and the fans were totally into it too. Big Show looked rediculous but sounded just like Hogan! =========
Crowd Participation = 4/5
Match Grade = DUD/5
Entertainment Value = Priceless
=========
6. T&A with Trish Stratus vs. Dudley Boyz. WOW is Trish Stratus hot! OK match with a great ending - WOOD! 2.5/5.
7. WWF European Title Match: Eddie Guerrero with Chyna vs. Essa Rios with Lita. This match is great and this SHOULD have been the Light Heavyweight Title match because it was some great high-flying action. Essa Rios takes a big Asai Moonsault to the outside and lands on the announcers table - Ouch! Chyna and Lita get involved - sorta. Chyna dominates like a man she wants not to be but still acts like one. Two weak punches by her to make Essa Rios go down twice. 4/5.
8. WWF Intercontinental Title Match: Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho. Great match here but a bad ending to the match. Very hard chops during the course of the match but for some reason I think both were holding back because they could have done much better with the ability they both posses. 4/5.
9. WWF Championship Match: Champion Triple H with Vince & Stephanie McMahon vs. The Rock with Steve Austin. Special Referee: Shane McMahon. One of the greatest booked main events of all time. Match told a hell of a story with Vince, Shane, The Stooges, Stephanie and Trips trying to cheat Rock out of the title win and get Triple H to stay Champion. Well, just when the ending seems near, Austins music hits - Place erupts - and he comes out and turns the tide. Great match and booking. 4.5/5 - 0.5 for the return of Austin.
All in all a good ppv but not even that great. I would rent it and take 2 VCRS and copy it. I don't recommed it to be bought for a rediculous price of 15+ dollars.",1044748800,4,5667,4.551420176297747
1062485,5,6305710414,This event was great. The main match featured HHH w/vince and stephanie v the rock w/stone cold. shano mac was an excellent ref and the finish of this match was absolutely fantastic! A great build up to this match hyped up the event and the match lived up to it. Big show beat up and comin Kurt Angle while dressed as hulk hogan and the 6-man hardcore match brought some great scenes. Buy this video now!!,1044576000,,405,4.342105263157895
1062486,5,6305710414,"Many people call this the best WWF PPV ever with good reason.  There's a little something for everyone here.
Light Heavyweight Title - Scotty Too Hotty vs. Dean Malenko - Malenko is an awesome mat wrestler and Scotty can do a little of everything.  This is very good, but not for someone who likes a really fast pace.  The finisher is breathtaking. ****
Tag Team Title Match - Edge & Christian vs. D-X - E & C's heel turn was put on hold for this match.  As with all E & C matches this is very solid.  The announcers seem to be pretending that Road Dogg and X-Pac are the New Age Outlaws.  This was the end of the last vestiges of the tag team scene that started in 1997 and continued until this show. **3/4
Big Boss Man & Bull Buchanan vs. Acolytes - Bleh. Filler. *
Hardcore Title - Crash vs. Tazz vs. Saturn vs. Hardcore vs. Hardyz - This is so frenetic I couldn't even hope to describe it.  The spot off the swinging blade is amazing.  Good hardcore match, but not what you might expect. ***1/2
Big Show vs. Kurt Angle - Big Show was a goofy, lovable giant and Kurt was going to beat some sense into him.  THE SHOWSTER~! makes his first appearance and is hilarious.  Match is nothing. * for the match ***1/2 for the Showster.
T&A vs. Dudleyz - The Dudleyz got over by putting women through tables.  Trish Stratus was the one woman they hadn't gotten to yet.  That's pretty much the storyline of the match as the Dudleyz want to get through Test and Albert to get to Trish. **1/4.  Bubba is the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
IC Title - Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho - Jericho made his name against Benoit in Japan, then debuted against Benoit in WCW.  These two will always be entwined in wrestling history like Flair-Steamboat, Hogan-Andre, and Rock-HHH.  This is a terrific match that shows why both men are so loved by fans of real wrestling.  Bad ending aside, this is a must see. ****1/2 The chops still ring in my ears.
European Title - Eddy Guerrero vs. Essa Rios - Eddy was going to night school and Chyna was his date to the prom, hence the tux.  Essa never really broke out because he couldn't speak English and he was largely a spot wrestler.  This is a pretty good match between two flyers.  Also, Lita looks awesome here! ***1/2
Championship Match - Triple H vs. The Rock - Shane is the special referee.  Austin is supposed to second The Rock but hasn't shown up.  Very solid match as both guys have perfected the art of working with each other at the main event level.  Shane and HHH get Rock Bottomed through the announce table...AT THE SAME TIME!!!  Austin does show up and we get the ending Wrestlemania should have had. ****
In the End: It's easy to see why this is considered by many to be the best PPV ever.  I disagree but I'd rank it right up there in the top five.  Still check out anything WWF from Jan. 2000 through June of 2000 and you won't be disappointed.  Strong recommendation.",1017792000,,2921,4.333333333333333
1062487,4,6305710414,"This was very entertaing show put on by the WWF.Why? Well 1st of it had  nice looking card that didn't dissapiont and 2nd there was a HOT Washington D.C crowd that was into the PPV from start to finish.
-The show kicked off with Road Dogg and X-pac taking on Edge and Christian for there Tag team belts. Very good opener that got the crowd pumped, also X-pac getting busted up pretty bad with a ring bell.
-Dean Malenko vs Scotty Too Hotty for the Light Weight Championship. WOW this match was surprisingly one of the nights best. Counter after Counter in this outstanding match. Starts off fast paced and shows that Scotty can wrestle singles matches and Malenko's finest match in the WWF.This also had a great ending.
-Bossman and Bull Buchanan vs APA  in a match that could have been better as these guys are around the same size this could have been a powerhouse match but sadly ends up being the boring match of the PPV.
-Hardcore Championship Match Champion Crash Holly vs. Tazz vs. Perry Saturn vs. Hardcore Holly vs. Hardy Boyz.
These guys got into it fast and was a nice little brawl with the usual WWF hardcore weapons such as road signs, bins, pans, chairs and a ladder, which sadly doesnt get used much. Although this match could have been more Hardcore it was very entertaining to say the least. Nice leap by Matt Hardy off the Backlash entrance.
-Shane Mcmahon interview.
-Bigshow (Showster) vs Kurt Angle in a short match up but funny if you are a fan or remember Hulk Hogan as Bigshow comes out dressed as him but acts like him and even for a while wrestles like him. But Show did get serious and showed Angle not to mess with him.
-Test and Albert with Trish take on Dudley Boyz in a decent match up  but nothing special until the end where Trishe's kiss didn't save her from Buh Buh Ray  this time as she gets PLANTED through the table with IMPACT.
-Eddie Guerrero with Chyna has a nice match up with Essa Rios with Lita. Eddie arrives in a chevy and gets changed into his gear ready to defend his European Championship in a fast paced match with a little Lucha libre and 2 highflying spots that stand out.
Although i rekon there should have been a bit more Lucha Libre style in the match as they are both from MEXICO but still was a good match.
-HHH interview
-Benoit interview
-Next was a CLASSIC match up and in my view was the show stealer. Chris Benoit vs Chris Jericho for Intercontinental Championship. These two Outstanding Canadians took each other to school in a great fast paced back and forth wrestling match with a contriversial ending. This could possibly be there best match during there WWF fued. If you are a fan of both of these great stars and never seen this match i suggest you pick this up as you won't be dissapionted.
-Rock interview
-The MAINEVENT of the night featured Champion HHH(with vince on his corner) vs The Rock(With Stone Cold Steve Austin in his corner) and special referee Shane Mcmahon.
Rock and HHH got into it quick with no sign of Austin which left Rock by him self and out numbered by three. There was some interference by Vince and unfair referring by Shane as you would expect. But the tide does turn as Stone Cold makes his awaited appearance to the hyped up crowd of Washington. Austin with a chair in hand smacks anything thats moving and comes to the Rock's aid as the crowd is roaring with excitment and a new champion is crowned.
The show ends with Austin and Rock sharing a beer.
-Exclusive footage - BACKLASH WRAP UP
-Malenko promo
-Crash Promo
-Angle promo
-Jericho promo
-Rock promo
All in all this in my view was one of the top PPV's of the year with 2 CLASSIC matches Jericho/Benoit and surprisingly Scotty/Malenko also not to mention WWF WORLD TITLE changed hands and Trish gets planted through a table.
This is a very good event with a card that delivers, will add nicely to your collection.
RECOMENDED",1012867200,,3878,4.504261363636363
1062606,4,6305710414,"Ok, first of all I do not have this video. I ordered the PPV when it was aired live. It was my first time doing that and I wasn't dissapointed. The matches held my interest and the main event had big hype. I'm a HUGE Austin fan so obviously I ordered this. The reason I was somewhat dissapointed was, is that when Steve ""returned"" all he did was give chair shots to everyone except The Rock and when Steve came out, the camera was on The Rock most of the time. Also he never really returned, it was just a 1-time thing. If you want the PPV when he really returned try Unforgiven 2000, he does alot more at that one also. So here is my opinion of the matches and how good they were:
WWF Title: Triple H vs. The Rock With Special Referee Shane McMahon: ***** -Great match, a title change and an appearence by Stone Cold Steve Austin!
2. WWF Intercontinental Title Match: Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho *** 3/4 -At this time I wasn't a big fan of either man but later (Royal Rumble 2K1) they became 2 of my favorite wrestlers. The match was overall pretty good though.
3. WWF European Title Match: Eddie Guerrero with Chyna vs. Essa Rios with Lita: **** -Awesome! Lots of high-flying moves but at the end we see Chyna in her underwear? Yuck!
4. T&A with Trish Stratus vs. Dudley Boyz **** -Finally, Trish goes through a table!
5. The Big Show vs. Kurt Angle **** -This match was short, good and funny. Big Show imitated Hulk Hogan, It was halarios.
6. WWF Hardcore Title Match: Champion Crash Holly vs. Tazz vs. Perry Saturn vs. Hardcore Holly vs. Hardy Boyz ***** -Great match by all men. Matt Hardy jumped off the Backlash hook thing which is problaby like 16 or so feet!
7. WWF Light Heavyweight Title Match: Dean Malenko vs. Scotty Too Hotty ***** -Hey! We need a match like this in a great PPV like this! I got caught up in the match and was very intertained. I agree with J.R. we need more Light-Heavyweight matches. Not just T.L.C. and ladder matches, REAL matches!
8. WWF Tag Team Title Match"" Edge & Christian vs. Road Dogg & X-Pac with Tori **** -This was actually a pretty good match. X-Pac getting hit with the ring bell and getting busted open for real made it better!
9. Big Boss Man & Bull Buchanan vs. Acolytes ** -Not very good at all.

Big Boss Man & Bull Buchanan against the APA wasn't that good of a match. It just wasn't short enough. The Tag Title match I thought brought out a pretty good fight in both teams. The Lightweight Title match I thought showed some awesome moves and a great finisher to win the match. The Hardcore match was awesome like all of them. There was a lot of action and a lot of wrestlers the two together make a real scene. Show was funny how he dressed as the Showster. He beat Kurt Angle so bad. Angle had no chance. The only reason why I liked the match with T & A Vs. The Dudleyz is because FINALLY Trish got some. There were some good moves, but a sleeper. The IC match was good until there was a DQ. The WWF title match was good because Austin came back and whooped. To top it off The Rock won back the WWF title. This is a must see and buy!",995068800,,1603,4.361204013377926
1062608,5,6305710414,"Backlash 2000 was nothing short of perfect, with great matches and a superb ending with the return of Stone Cold Steve Austin delivering chair shots to everyone, including the WWF Champion, Triple H. All the matches, including the Tag Team and European matches were solid. Here are the matches:
1. TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP Edge & Christian vs. Road Dogg & X-Pac - since winning at WrestleMania, E&C seem to be on a great Tag Team title win streak, or at least until Unforgiven. Debra is the guest ring announcer.
2. LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP Dean Malenko vs. Scotty Too Hotty - dullest of all on the card. Sleeper match. I don't care much for Malenko, or Too Cool for that matter.
3. HARDCORE CHAMPIONSHIP Matt Hardy vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Hardcore Holly vs. Tazz vs. Perry Saturn vs. Crash Holly - excellent Hardcore title match, with Crash sneaking in a victory.
4. Big Show vs. Kurt Angle - Big Show comes out dressed as the Showster, so it made for a comical relief to put Angle out of his misery.
5. Dudley Boyz vs. Test & Albert - Hey, Dudleys finally put Trish through a table, but lose the match.
6. EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP Eddie Guerrero w/Chyna vs. Essa Rios w/Lita - You don't see Essa Rios around to much anymore, so if you are a fan of the high-flying daredevil, than this tape is watch you need. Awesome aerial maneveurs from both men.
7. INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho - Benoit wins by Disqualification, which is very predictable. You'll see why.
8. WWF CHAMPIONSHIP Triple H vs. The Rock - I am a great fan of Triple H, but I had to agree with everyone else that it was time for a new champ. The Rock is a little overrated though. But nice interference from Stone Cold, so I would recommend this to anyone, even those who don't like Rock or HHH, get it for nostalgia for Stone Cold, Essa Rios, and Debra's sake.",990662400,,1853,4.534328358208955

This was a bad match for E and C but it was a good way to open up the event, During the match Chirstian hit X-pac really hard with the ring bell.
2) Light Heavyweight title: Champion Dean Malenko vs. Scotty Too Hotty
This is a good match for the light heavyweight division, it has of course scotty to hottys worm in it and a lot of technical wrestling in it.
3) Big Boss Man & Bull Buchanan vs. Acolytes
This was a bad match, Bull Buchanan did a good job of wrestling but the big boss man just ..., Bradshaw did some aerial manuvers and Farroq did power moves.
4) Hardcore title: Champion Crash Holly vs. Tazz vs. Perry Saturn vs. Hardcore Holly vs. Hardy Boyz
I think this was the match of the night, it had some crazy stuff done in it especcially by the hardy boyz, the superstars used the super structure very creatively, they jumped, fell, swang and even broke one of the hooks. This match also used a ladder which was used for advantage by Jeff Hardy who did a Swanton Bomb off it, Crash Holly took a beaten and Tazz was the brawler of the night, great hardcore match that combeins weapons with wrestling just like the way ir really should be.
5) The Big Show vs. Kurt Angle
This was just a gimmick match when Hulk Hogans music turned on but instead of Hulk came the big show dressed as him, This was very funny big show even did hulks impressions and moves.
6) ... with Trish Stratus vs. Dudley Boyz
I liked this match alot and it included trish being put threw a table, Test and Albert really showed that they could wrestle.
7) European title: Champion Eddie Guerrero with Chyna vs. Essa Rios with Lita
In the begging Eddie and Chyna have a surprise entrance,great match, include almost all of Essa Rios high flying, acrobatic moves which are really amazing. At one point Essa did a moonsault off the top rope and went to far so he landed right on the announce table which is really amazing, at the end you see chyna getting ... by lita.
8) Intercontinental title: Champion Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho
This had lots of technical moves especcialy by chris benoit, the refree did a good job of keeping up with things especcialy at the end when benoit went for the head butt and jericho used the belt to smash benoits face in.
9) WWF title: Champion Triple H with Vince McMahon & Stephanie McMahon vs. The Rock with Steve Austin
The main event was not that good but when stone cold steve austin came out for his return after many years the crowd went nuts, Austin nailed every superstar that came in his way includeing Gerald Brisco and Pat Patterson with a chair, there were no stone cold stunners, but thats ok because the rock still became the WWF champion.
Overall the event was amazing and every match had a least one thing that you will remember, This event had lots of bumps but i think the bump of the PPV was Matt Hardy who jumped off the Backlash hook about 12 feet in the air. Overall Rating 9/10",989625600,,2993,4.355992844364938

April 30, 2000 -- Washington D.C. -- MCI Center
Edge & Christian vs. Road Dogg & X-Pac -- This is a Tag Team Title Match.  A great effort put on by all four men, as the crowd is into the whole match.
Dean Malenko vs. Scotty II Hotty -- One of the best matches of the night, as these guys put forth an incredible effort as the loser of the match takes a man-sized bump at the end.
Acolytes vs. Bull Buchanan & Big Boss Man -- This was a pretty good match, but not one of the highlight ones.  Surprisingly, these four big brawlers showcase some great wrestling maneuvers.
Crash Holly vs. Tazz vs. Perry Saturn vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy vs. Hardcore Holly -- This is a classic hardcore title match as everybody goes after the houdini of hardcore, Crash Holly.  Matt Hardy practically commits suicide as he jumps off of the entryway onto his five opponents!  I am not a fan of hardcore, but I liked this match.
Big Show vs. Kurt Angle -- The match itself was awful, but it is short and is the funniest thing I have ever seen in my life.  Buy the video just for this part!
Dudley Boyz vs. T&A -- Not a very impressive match and was probably the only real fast forward match on the card.  The ending is pretty well-booked though.  The match just drags on and on.
Eddie Guerrero vs. Essa Rios -- Pretty good match, but Essa Rios just isn't over.  There is a reason that this was Essa Rios' only pay-per-view appearance (unless Papi Chulo was in a Royal Rumble or something).
Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit -- Need I say more?  Best match of the night, by far.
Triple H vs. The Rock -- The contreversy of whether or not ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin will be in the house runs throughout this match, officiated by Shane McMahon.  I am not a big Rock fan, but I did heavily enjoy this match.  I also think that a WWF Pay-Per-View can be successful without a McMahon (or all four, like this one had) being involved in the main event.  But when you own a company, I guess you can do anything you want with it.
Nothing can be perfect, but this PPV was close.  A great event with a great effort by everybody.  Had it not been for the People's Elbow this would have gotten FIVE STARS.  I actually gave it FOUR AND A HALF STARS and rounded up.

7893359,5,6305710414,"1.) WWF Tag Team Championship Match: Road Dogg and X-Pac w/Tori vs Edge and Christian (c)

Debra was the special announcer for the match. A joy to look at in the ring but horrible at announcing. Both teams were heel in this match but Edge and Christian were the crowd favorites, unofficially making them babyfaces for this match. Great Tag Team opener with nice action from both teams. Christian nails X-Pac with the ring bell, busting him open, while the referee's back was turned and pins him to win the match

_______________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) WWF Light Heavyweight Championship Match: Scotty 2 Hotty vs Dean Malenko (c)

Nothing short of a spectacular match! This was probably the best match of Scotty's career, going against one of the best and underrated technicians to happen to WWF. Malenko retains with an amazing Tornado DDT off the top turnbuckle

_______________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) Bull Buchanan and Big Boss Man vs The Acolytes

An okay match. Nothing big happening here. Boss Man hits Bradshaw with his nightstick while the ref's back is turned and Buchanan hits a leg drop off the top for the win.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) WWF Hardcore Championship Match: Crash Holly (c) vs Tazz vs Matt Hardy vs Jeff Hardy vs Hardcore Holly vs Perry Saturn

Another entertaining Hardcore match at another PPV. Plenty of weapons introduced in the match as well as the action taking place in and out of the ring and up at the entrance ramp. Crash was the main target going into the match, so a lot of the guys beat down on poor Crash many times throughout the match. Crash manages to survive another day by pinning Tazz to escape with the Hardcore Title

_______________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) Big Show vs Kurt Angle

Following Wrestlemania, The Big Show decided he just wanted to have a little bit of fun and began a babyface run as a comical character who would dress up as other superstars and whatnot and imitate them. Kurt Angle was disgusted by this and made the mistake of getting in Show's face, which lead to this match. Show came out to the match as the Showster (imitation of Hulk Hogan). This was a short, comical squash match. Jerry Lawler's laugh made this really enjoyable to watch. Kurt gets in a little offense but Show come back and wins with the Chokeslam

_______________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) The Dudley Boyz vs T&A w/Trish Stratus

The Dudleyz were quickly becoming known for putting women through tables and Trish Stratus seemed to be next on the list. But a supposed infatuation for Bubba Ray, saved Trish from being from being put through one, planting a kiss on Bubba Ray, any time she felt in danger. Seemingly decent Tag Team match that sees Test get the win over Bubba with a Big Boot after Trish distracted Bubba. Following the match, the Dudleyz attack T&A and finally give the crowd what they'd been wanting to see; Trish getting put through a table!

_______________________________________________________________________________________________

7.) WWF European Championship Match: Eddie Guerrero (c) w/Chyna vs Essa Rios w/Lita

The match all came about after Lita mistakenly cost Eddie Guerrero a few matches when he and Essa teamed up. Chyna grew tired of it and fed Lita to be Powerbombed through a table by the Dudleyz. Lita came back and intentionally attacked Chyna during another one of Eddie's matches, which was no mistake. Ultimately this match seemed to be happening more because of Chyna and Lita than Eddie and Essa's problems, but it proved to be a fairly impressive Lucha Libre style title match. Jerry was making his usual perverted comments towards Lita but with a belly and boobs oiled up like Lita's, I'd be perverted too. Eddie retains the title with an Airplane Spin and Neckbreaker. Lita strips Chyna of her evening gown following the match and runs off with it

_______________________________________________________________________________________________

8.) WWF Intercontinental Championship Match: Chris Jericho vs Chris Benoit (c)

This was the first one on one bout that Jericho and Benoit had on PPV and it was an amazing one. As a person who grew up as a kid in the Attitude Era, Benoit vs Jericho was one of my favorite feuds to happen in the WWF. Nothing but a splendid bout from 2 of the best from the Attitude Era! Stiff competition at times but that's what made it so great. Jericho gets DQ'd after Benoit does a Diving Headbutt off the top rope and Jericho uses the IC Championship as a guard. Jericho snaps and puts referee Tim White in the Walls of Jericho. But what a tremendous match though. Luckily, Jericho and Benoit would go on to have a many more PPV encounters down the line

_______________________________________________________________________________________________

9.) WWF Championship Match: The Rock w/Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Triple H w/Stephanie McMahon and Vince McMahon  (Special Guest Referee: Shane McMahon)

Following Wrestlemania, The Rock earned another WWF Title match and the McMahon Family had all the odds stacked against The Rock leading up to Backlash. Shane was made the referee and Vince and Stephanie would be in Triple H's corner. Linda McMahon stepped in and decided that because Rock was outnumbered, she was putting Stone Cold Steve Austin in Rock's corner. It would be Austin's first PPV appearance since he was ran down at the previous year's Survivor Series. It's kind of odd how they didn't even mention that but I guess they didn't want to mix storylines at the time. Overall it was an amazing match to end the PPV. The drama with the McMahons screwing with The Rock was quite fun to watch unfold. Austin shows up nearing the end and the crowd goes wild! Austin kicks the baddies asses and Linda replaces Shane with Earl Hebner. The Rock capitalizes with a People's Elbow and The Rock is the new WWF Champion!",1398729600,,6167,5.3254376930998975

7893363,5,6305710414,"Another old tape that I have in my collection but this event was exactly the same way that the previous Backlash was in which this event heavily made up & surpassed the previous WrestleMania. During this time, Vince McMahon had turned on The Rock at WrestleMania with the McMahons making The Rock's life a living hell, however a swerve was thrown into the mix as Stone Cold Steve Austin would be returning on this night but the question was, who would he side with?

WWF Tag Team Champions Edge & Christian vs X-Pac & Road Dogg. Before the match, Debra had made her return to the WWF to ring announce this opening contest. Great tag team action here as the match build up & gradually picked up some steam that actually had the crowd getting into the action. One moment to look out for would be the shot that X-Pac took with the ring bell at the hands of Christian that busted him open pretty badly.

WWF Light Heavyweight Champion Dean Malenko vs Scotty 2 Hotty. Malenko was always an underrated performer & this match showcased it as he gave Scotty the best match of his singles career. A great wrestling match that was actually similar to the opener in which the action started off slow to begin with but picked up some momentum as the match progress that once again hooked the crowd into the action.

Big Bossman & Bull Buchanan vs Acolytes. This was better than Bull & Bossman's opening match at WrestleMania but just like that match, this was nothing more than just an average filler.

Hardcore Champion Crash vs Tazz vs Perry Saturn vs Hardcore Holly vs Hardy Boyz. The stipulation to this match was that for the match to end either Crash has to retain the title or one of the challengers have to beat Crash for the title. This was the typical multiman hardcore brawl with them hitting each other with weapons & brawling but some moments to look out for would be the interaction between Tazz/Saturn, the Hollys going at it & the Hardys being the human highlight reels during this match including jumping off the Backlash set.

Big Show vs Kurt Angle. Big Show came out as a new persona here as he acted & even sounded like Hulk Hogan. The purpose of this match was to deliver some comedy & it worked as Show was pretty funny but besides that, this was mostly a squash win for Show.

Test & Albert vs Dudley Boyz. A good tag team match as both teams worked well together but the real highlight was the aftermath that lead to Bubba Ray Dudley finally putting Trish through a table.

WWF European Champion Eddie Guerrero vs Essa Rios. Jim Ross quoted this match perfectly as he said ""someone should notify Reagan Airport"" because this was a high-flying war with Rios showing how underrated he was during his run with the WWF. With some mat-wrestling & the Chyna/Lita involvement becoming a factor in the match, this was another great match.

Intercontinental Champion Chris Benoit vs Chris Jericho. Anytime that you see these two going at it, you know that you are promised to get one of the best matches of the night & this was no exception. Both men worked over each other's bodyparts to help set up their submission moves with the usual intense chopping contest that had Jim Ross & Jerry Lawler literally sit there silently to hear the impact. Awesome wrestling match despite the way that the match ended.

WWF Champion Triple H vs The Rock w/Special Referee Shane McMahon. Before the match, Vince McMahon addresses to the crowd that Stone Cold Steve Austin will not be showing up tonight much to the dismay of the crowd. Just like I have said many times before, these two have never had a bad match as they delivered another great match here. This time, involved Vince getting involved many times along with Patterson & Brisco coming out to have the numbers gain on the Rock. From there, Stone Cold Steve Austin made his return & did what he does best & that was open up a can of whoop a** before The Rock was able to get his ""WrestleMania revenge"" & regain the title to even having a beer bash with Austin at the end.

In the end, just the previous year's card, this event had a better match quality & easily topped the previous WrestleMania making this an event I would go out of my way to get.",1223510400,,4203,4.503937007874016
7893364,5,6305710414,"Awesome Backlash. Some great matches on the card.

1. Edge and Christian vs. DX(WWF Tag Team Championship)

This was an awesome way to kick off the pay-per-view. Fast paced action and the crowd was really into it. X-Pac had a really bad cut on his head from the ringbell shot. 9 out of 10.

2. Dean Malenko vs. Scotty 2 Hotty(WWF Light Heavyweight Championship)

Very good matchup. Scotty put on a great performance along with Malenko(who is always good). Not as much high-flying action in this one, but it was made up for by the European Title match. Sick DDT off the top rope. The only problem was that the middle was a little boring. 9 out of 10.

3. Acolytes vs. Big Boss Man vs. Bull Buchanan

This match wasn't good at all. The only thing that is actually worth watching is the pretty cool scissors kick off the top rope. 4 out of 10.

4. Crash vs. Hardcore Holly vs. Perry Saturn vs. Tazz vs. The Hardy Boyz(WWF Hardcore Championship)

This match had some crazy moves. The Hardyz really helped this match, because they brought their high-flying moves to the match. I loved the parts where they were all by the Backlash hooks. Good weapons use, especially with the ladders. 9 out of 10.

5. Kurt Angle vs. The Big Show

Bad match, but it was pretty funny. Thats all I can say. 5 out of 10.

6. T and A vs. The Dudley Boyz

May I start by saying, Trish was pretty damn hot! Even in the history. Phew! OK, I'm done. The match itself was actually pretty good. Bubba is a very lucky man. 7 out of 10.

7. Eddie Guerrero(RIP) vs. Essa Rios(WWF European Championship)

Essa Rios was such an awesome wrestler. In this match, he displayed his awesome high-flying skills. Essa jumped over the turnbuckle and ring post and did a senton onto Eddie. 9 out of 10.

8. Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit(WWF Intercontinental Championship)

First off, I have to say that Jericho saying Chris Benoit's name wrong was pretty funny. But the match was a classic. There weren't too many crazy moments, but these two guys just wrestled their hearts out. I really liked the steel steps spot. The DQ ending should have taken away from the match, but it really didn't for me. The reason why is because Benoit really hit his face on the belt and was really bleeding. 10 out of 10.

9. Triple H vs. The Rock(WWF Championship)

Shane McMahon was the special ref and most of the other McMahons were at ringside cheering for Triple H.The match really picked up within the last 10 minutes, and that double Rock Bottom through the Announcer's Table was awesome. Stone Cold came back and cleaned house as well. 9 out of 10.

I highly recommend this pay-per-view to any wrestling fan.",1147478400,4,2653,4.478170478170478
