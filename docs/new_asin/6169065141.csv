7803842,2,6169065141,Average subtitles. Was expected better. I have bought both versions. This version and the Poh Kim (PK) version. The PK has much better subtitles and was much more nicely packaged compared to this version. I don't think I would ever buy again from this brand with the little pink sticker.,1431734400,2,287,4.76

Moon Geun-young, as Yoo Jung, is one of Korea's very best and favorite actresses, and excels in bringing her character to life.
Lee Sang-yoon (Angel Eyes, 2014, and many more) is great as Prince Gwanghae (prince charming).  While on a hunting trip with his older brother, he falls into a hunting trap - a pit dug by Jung and her brother - and meets Jung, his woman of destiny.  They fall in love but despite Gwanghae's deep love for Jung, he can not be with her.  He later becomes the 15th king of the Joseon Dynasty.",1424563200,3,726,4.519083969465649
