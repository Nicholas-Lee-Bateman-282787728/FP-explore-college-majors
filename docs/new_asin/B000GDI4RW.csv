2604800,5,B000GDI4RW,"I own this whole series in the separate sets, but buying the complete series in one is probably cheaper. Anyhow, the whole series is wonderful and dreadully funny, and, a major plus, some good looking guys to feast your eyes on too, the best of the lot being Arnie Lawson, played by Peter England in the first series, he is so utterly yummy and gorgeous looking, then there is Brian & Kurt of course, though not exactly as lovely looking as Arnie, they are very appealing characters, and then from the end of episode two, we have Matt, who is very nice looking, and then in series four, we have lovely Ben, so, plenty of fanciable guys to drool over! Not much in the female line, apart from Penny, but then I guess she makes up for the lack of female talent in the rest, though Jenny is not bad, the females in the series are none as good looking as the males, though I know it is a matter of taste, and personally, I don't find Simon attractive at all, though many people seem to, so I guess there may be some viewers who prefer Liz or even Carol, but for me at least, I felt I was well catered for in the hottie stakes, especially with Arnie! And the comedy of the series is unsurpassed by anything, so wonderfully non-PC! Wish there was a series five, six and seven too! Even more outrageous. It would be so cool.",1211846400,2,1316,4.268
8130677,5,B000GDI4RW,"This is a great series.  I love anything Andrew Lincoln is in, he is a fantastic actor and it is really fun to watch his earlier work.  He has a great comedic presence and the other actors do a great job tool.  The cast ensemble was a great choice and the series is light and funny.  It is the kind of show that just makes you feel good all over when you watch it.  It is a great way to relax and laughter is always good medicine.  I give this entire series two thumbs up for content, casting and creativity.",1478131200,,508,4.03

8130683,1,B000GDI4RW,"I bought this on the recommendation of the reviews, thinking it must be great comedy. Mistake. I watched the first disc with my son last night. He gave up after half an hour. I persisted through the whole first episode, but I don't think I can bear any more. Life is too short. It's unfunny, to the point of boring. There is no narrative worth following. The characters are cardboard caricatures, unlike any teachers I have ever known (lots!). What a waste of money! Anyone want to buy my complete series at cost price? No, I thought not.",1405728000,,538,4.5

OK, I will. If you are into brilliant British humour (spelling is correct for UK), you will enjoy yet another channel 4 series. This is one.",1388966400,,187,4.371428571428571
8130685,4,B000GDI4RW,"I loved this show a few years back... I was introduced to it mid way through it's third season, so I was a late comer but I did pick up all the individual series (1-3) on dvd after that season ended and watched season 4 on tv the following year and picked up that season on dvd too.

I really love the camaraderie of this show... despite the various cast comings and goings, I think the show managed to stay fresh and interesting and very funny too throughout all series'.

Okay, I recently weeded out my dvds and watched them in order..I  personally felt seasons 2 and 3 are the best.

Series 1 is very Simon -centred... I know Andrew Lincoln was the star of the show and main attraction originally thanks to his This Life fame ... but God, it was a bit irritating watching back  how his neurosis was focused on so much in series one as opposed to really developing the other characters... knowing how fun they were in subsequent seasons, I was kinda itching to get through season 1 because it does feel very like The Simon (and maybe Jenny) Show...

Season 2 is cracking, the show shifts more evenly towards other characters.. Susan after her divorce is fun, Jenny is more likeable but still bitchy enough to be interesting, Kurt and Brian take focus more too and their double act really is polished, Penny is hilariously incompetent and couldn't care less and JP is kinda charmingly smug... Of course, Liz is a bigger bitch this year too and fun to watch and Carol is still pining for Kurt and Simon leaves by the end of the series (and it is really a relief I feel).

Series 3 is great too... I feel it's the peak really... it shows how the show is way more than an Andrew Lincoln vehicle.  Kurt and Brian really take more central roles and really shine, Lindsay is a great addition as is slimy Matt and Penny thankfully gets her own back on him during this series...hopeless Bob is quite funny too as is Liz again... Carol is quite clueless with that baby of hers which is amusing too. This series has some great storylines like when Kurt and Brian fall out, when Kurt is wheelchair bound and when Brian goes on his date with the dinner lady..

Series 4 wasn't as bad for me as some found it... though I will admit it, I did think the show suffered due to the loss of Kurt and Brian and in a way Damien and are quite thinly veiled replacements for the duo... I liked how in the past seasons, when someone left they weren't just replaced with a pale imitation but with a totally new and different character.. this time I think the producers got it a little wrong... the show does become a little too focused on Bob this year too and his Thai bride story is a little overdone and drawn out... but still the show does have its moments... it can still be quite funny... Penny and her relationship with a student was a good twist, Lindsay is still as witty as ever, Claire and Liz are still fun to watch and some of the stories are as good as other seasons... like Lindsay's forced diet...
But by the last episode, you do feel the show has come to a natural end... the new characters just didn't gel in as well as could have been hoped and the wedding in the school was a bit ridiculous even for Teachers!

Still, this show is a very funny, very politically incorrect and enjoyable show to watch.... And re-watching it recently highlighted to me how it never really got the credit it deserved for being so well- written, sharply observed and the various funny minute detailing in scenes could easily be overlooked.. a lot of work went into this show you sense and for the most part,  it was bloody hilarious....

As for this boxset of all four seasons, I have the individual seasons but this boxset seems excellent value, I'm sure I paid more for each season than this boxset costs... excellent value if you  are a fan or if you fancy something politically incorrect and funny to relax to.",1259452800,2,3889,4.384722222222222
8130686,5,B000GDI4RW,"To look at the education system from the sole point of view of the libido, positive or negative, love or hate, live or die, of the teachers is an amazing starting point but so justified. We always think teachers are dedicated to their work, when they are only attached - with greedy chains mind you - to their jobs and particularly the regular though not heavy pay and the long vacation periods, something like there months a year. We even often think they are moral, ethical, pure, when they only think of having any kind of emotional imbroglio with their colleagues, edging onto and even ending in bed. And luckily we don't know, nor want to know, the details because too often that frolicking is always or nearly always ridiculous, silly, unsatisfying, frustrating, even in a way incestuous, I mean felt like sleeping with your brother or sister, some kind of dummy in some kind of show window if not even showcase for everyone to know, see and appreciate.

This British series is showing that level of the behind-the-wings scene marvelously but also sickeningly. But it goes far beyond that. It shows how this carnal obsession becomes comprehensive, the only word that fits the situation and the institution in Britain where nearly all secondary schools are comprehensive from 12 to 18, and then it obnubilates all other aspects or levels. They become lazy, out of incompetence, they try to do as little as possible, to keep some energy for their kinky nocturnal activities that can take place in the stationery cabinet that has the tendency to become perambulating instead of stationary, or the photocopying closet, they spend their nights in pubs and are drunk every evening and hung-over all next day long. They are insensitive to the students and their problems, or at times only sensitive to the appeal of boys and girls, crisscross and cattycorner.

They would pretend to be gender-friendly, but they are fundamental g***-bashers, not with a baseball or cricket bat but in their minds that are entirely p***-boasting all the time, and in their language that contains so many four letter words, F words like fun and fair and -uck words like duck and muck, that you just wonder if they are not all of them the Tourette-syndrome patients of the central mental hospital of New York City, or Bristol if you prefer, all released at the same time from their cuckoo's nest for a trip in the city.

They become p***-boasters, c***-measurers, d***-brandishers , even if and when they are women who have the sad tendency to imitate their men colleagues. They are unable to conceive what a g*** relation may be or mean, and the teachers who are g*** are always secretive about it, if not even more than that, short-lived in the institution and confronted to such a suspicion from everyone that they have to jump off the cliff and escape that Dracula's castle. The series is on such points so realistic, so strong that we just wonder if we are not dealing with some reality show gone berserk. But it goes even beyond that.

It shows the constant struggle, fight, battle, war going on around power, from the power a teacher has in his small little tiny territorial ghetto called his or her classroom, to the tyrannical - and it is always tyrannical no matter what - power of the higher-ups from school secretaries to heads of departments to principals and inspectors and even ministers if not prime ministers who have the tendency to consider the school system as their favorite campaigning and canvassing ground.

But the series turns that into a force with each episode or smaller group of episodes dealing with one particular problem showing the absolute hypocrisy of this teaching profession, from race relations to religious diversity or gender orientation or whatever, like citizenship or violence.

The last topic of the last season is admirable with the principal delegating one younger man teacher to seduce and do what he can - you can imagine what when you see him coming back rearranging his tie - with the woman inspector who found out about what was in the wings, had a glimpse at the reality if not truth of the divinely sadistic torturing chamber in which the ""mental"" - as they call them - students are both dealt with and given a free hand at dealing with themselves or rather one another on a rotating basis. And the ""mental"" Bob, an English teacher who had been head of the English department for three seasons, is buying himself a wife in Thailand via the Internet, and is not even able to see, accept and go along with the fact that it is only for a visa. Worse than me you die, in tremendously satanic suffering. The only criticism I will level at the film is that there is No Future in it, that it is Absolutely Punk.

Academia it's a fascist regime just like Rule Britannia was thirty years ago. But instead of the S*** Pistols and their B**** we get Channel 4, its international satellite broadcasting and ""Belle and Sebastian"". There is No Hope either, no seed for any possible improvement and when there appears a beam of sunshine it is short-lived and it comes from the fact one day one teacher goes dry on alcohol and then her or his sudden positive motivation is as if the institution were going cold turkey.

Enjoy that series of only twelve DVDs. But go at it little dose by little dose, small installment by small installment, tiny take by tiny take, slowly and spread out in time if not on the floor vomiting at this sedating purge, that is ""mental"" with the standard meaning. A brain hernia is guaranteed if you get an overdose of that.
