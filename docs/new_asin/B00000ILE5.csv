1222650,5,B00000ILE5,"IN A NUTSHELL:

Simply stated, ""Alien"" is a landmark horrific-science-fiction film set in deep space that must be seen to be believed. Yes, ""ALIEN"" IS THAT GOOD!

WHAT ""ALIEN"" IS ALL ABOUT:

All was going rather well for the crew of the ill-fated Nostromo until the computer awoke them from hypersleep before they reached Earth. The reason was unexpected, to investigate a possible life-form, and the crew was less than thrilled over the prospect.

BUT FOR THE AUDIENCE, IT ALL STARTS OUT WITH A SETTING:

Even before the crew awakened, the setting was eerie as though something was already underfoot. I can recall seeing this film in the theater in 1979 and thinking from the beginning of the film that this sound or that must be coming from the alien. If something was moving or vibrating on the ship, before the crew was even awakened, one gets the impression that perhaps a monster was already lurking. Of course, without having seen the film, one does not yet know that the monster is not yet on the ship, but this feeling of anxious doom seems to start from the opening credits and pervades all the way through the film.

BACK TO THE MISSION: ACT I: IS THERE A LIFE-FORM ON THIS PLANET? LET'S TAKE A LOOK!

Okay, so the crew wakes up. After grumbling a bit to Captain Dallas, Dallas [Tom Skerritt] leads an away team to ascertain the source of the distress signal which has mother [the computer] suggesting that there may be a life-form on the planet. In the course of their excursion, they discover a strange pod field, reminiscent of eggs. Then things get really weird and dangerous when some sort of face-hugging crab-creature explodes out of one of the pods and attaches itself to 1st Officer Kane [John Hurt]. Despite Ripley's [Sigourney Weaver] objections, science officer Ash [Ian Holm] opens the ships air-lock so that the away team and the immobilized Kane can return to the ship. The acid-blooded crab-monster eventually just came loose from where it had attached itself to Kane and appeared dead. Kane appeared to have been fully recovered, with only a ravenous appetite to remind him that something had happened to him. As he satiated that hunger, Kane began to suddenly convulse. The convulsions became more violent until, without warning, an alien lizard burst from Kane's stomach and vanished in the bowels of the huge cargo vessel.

TIME FOR ACT II: ALIEN STALKS THE HUMANS ONE-BY-ONE

Once on the loose, the alien hatchling appears to have grown as evidenced by the shedded skin that is found shortly thereafter by one of the crewmen. Then, the now-enlarged alien starts stalking the humans. One-by-one they start to vanish, but there is nothing quiet or mysterious about it, only real, unnerving surprise when the alien does strike. Each member of the crew is systematically eliminated in a rather dramatic and suspenseful manner. Creepy or chilling would be an understatement.

ACT III: SURVIVAL OR NOT?

Even before they are all but killed-off, the remaining survivors decide to get off the ship and blow it up by setting the nuclear reactor to go supercritical. Apparently, the alien has something to say about this. This is the climax of ""Alien,"" so I will refrain from giving away the ending. Suffice it to say, that ""Alien"" is among the fastest-paced 115 minutes you may ever spend watching a film. So compelling a film is ""Alien,"" that it spawned three sequels all of which are worth watching.

BOTTOM LINE:  A BIT GRAPHIC BUT VERY WELL-DONE HORRIFIC SCI-FI

A really frightening horrific science-fiction film set in space that has held up incredibly well over time. The actors were first rate and the direction by Ridley Scott created an atmosphere of impending doom. The first sequel, ""Aliens"" from 1986, is also an incredibly well-done film featuring a larger scope.",1164844800,,5529,5.015418502202643
1222651,5,B00000ILE5,"I remember being FOOLED by my younger brothers to take them to this movie. It played on EVERY fear...and worked my last nerve up that I LEFT the movie theater before the monster started its carnage. It took me over a DECADE to finally watch the whole thing...and that was with the sound turned down and fast forwarding it through the carnage.

Of course, I've finally seen the whole thing.

Still creeps me out.

If you don't own it and you're a horror fan, buy it. The sequels don't come close to the original.",1162339200,,511,4.414893617021277
1222652,5,B00000ILE5,"In 1979, Ridley Scott had given us a film that is considered to be the scariest film in Science Fiction history. That film is entitled, ALIEN. ALIEN has been a favorite with so many people around the world. It is the film that set the stage for three sequels that are worthy to this original film. The film also features a Sigourney Weaver in her first starring role.

On their way back to Earth, a crew of seven people aboard the space craft, The Nostromo, are ready to fight for their lives against a creature that is perfectly evolved to clearly wipe out mankind. In this crew, there is CAPTAIN DALLAS (played by Tom Skerritt), LT. RIPLEY (played by Sigourney Weaver), LAMBERT (played by Veronica Cartwright), BRETT (played by Harry Dean Stanton), KANE (played by John Hurt), ASH (played by Ian Holm), & PARKER (played by Yaphet Kotto). As they learn that they are half-way back to Earth, they receive a signal from a nearby planet called LV-426. They mistake the signal for an S.O.S. They land on LV-426, but crashing the ship just a bit. The ship can easily be repaired. Dallas, Kane, and Lambert are set to investigate what is on this planet. Kane finds dozens of eggs lying around. One particular egg hatches, but Kan does not have a chance to look at what is inside, for some sort of organism, known as the face-hugger, jumps out and attaches itself to Kane's face. Back on board, Ash and Dallas get Kane out of his space suit and helmet. They are shocked to see the face-hugger. They try taking the face-hugger off, but the face-hugger bleeds concentrated acid. They decide that it may kill Kane if they try prying it off, so they leave it alone. About an hour or two later, Dallas, Ripley, and Ash find that the face-hugger is off of Kane's face. The face-hugger has died, and Kane has now awaken. They all sit down to have dinner, but Kane never gets a chance to eat, for a little creature bursts through Kane's chest. The little creature is an alien that will soon grow into a gigantic killing machine.

Parker, Brett, and Ripley head out to find the little alien. Instead, they find Ripley's frightened cat, Jones. Brett goes after Jones, but finds that the alien has shed his skin and is now a gigantic killing machine. He finds Jones, but even before he can grab him, Brett turns around to find the alien that was once a small little creature standing behind in front of him. Brett sees the end of his life. Dallas has a plan to get rid of it, but he dies in the process. One by one, every crew member is slain, until Ripley is left. She sets a self-destruct bomb on the ship, grabs Jones, and gets safely in the shuttle. As the shuttle pulls away from The Nostromo, Ripley watches The Nostromo blow into nothing with the alien inside. As Ripley prepares to go into hypersleep, she finds the alien aboard the shuttle with her. She blows the alien out of the airlock, finally killing it. She finally gets into hypersleep, while waiting for the network to find her in the next six weeks.

ALIEN is definitely the best film in all of Science Fiction history. It is an award-winning film that set the stage for its three stunning sequels that were well on their way. If you have not seen ALIEN, well, now's your chance. So buy a copy for yourselves, sit back, and enjoy.",1117929600,,3281,4.483277591973244
1222653,3,B00000ILE5,"I'm an old time Aliens fan. I use to sit in class and draw aliens on a piece of paper, the aliens found in this movie, not those little green men. Everyone thought I was nuts, but I sure fooled them, I'm crazy not nuts ha!
Read further down to have an overall fast rating if you want to watch the rest of the Aliens Trilogy set. This movie is one of the worst in the whole Trilogy. Why? They use about half of the movie to introduce the setting and object and characters of the movie. The action is rare and it is usually exciting for about a couple of moments, than it goes back to being suspense and talking.
However, don't be too upset. Aliens, which is part two where they just add an s, which I must say is very clever, is the best in the Trilogy. The action goes from mild, to medium, to a lot, and intense, and also introduces you to the massive alien queen. The graphics is awesome by the way, very impressed. Part 3 or Aliens 111 is plan weak, more or less like the first part, but watch it once and get ready for Aliens Ressurrection and Aliens VS. Predator coming out soon. If AvP sucks I'm no longer their Fan, blah!!!",1081900800,,1130,4.117647058823529

1222655,5,B00000ILE5,"I saw this film the week it opened, and ended up going back to the theatre 6 times to see it before it closed, not to mention the numerous times I've seen it on video, TV, and now DVD. The critics were very unreceptive initially, many calling it a ""dreary"" and ""predictable"" ""space opera."" Even as an adolescent, I thought, ""Shoot, what do THEY know?"" I was right--""Alien"" has stood the test of time, and remains one of the scariest films ever made. Sigourney Weaver is astonishing, using the right blend of toughness and humanity to flesh out her character. The rest of the distinguished cast is equally wonderful: Ian Holm as the twitchy ""Ash,"" Tom Skerrit as broody ""Dallas,"" Veronica Cartwright as whiney ""Lambert,"" and Harry Dean Stanton in his portrait of stunned space grunt ""Brett,"" etc. These are not meant to be fully fleshed-out characters--as evidenced by the use of their last names--but they are nonetheless adequately engaging and believable to evoke our empathy as the horror of their journey unfolds. The set design and cinematography is legendary, as is the vision of Ridley Scott, and the creature is one of the screen's coldest, most ferocious killers. The less you know about this film, the better, but it still stands up as a great viewing experience after repeated viewings, even as you anticipate the next scene. The dialogue is crisp and just funny enough to make the creepy elements all the more jarring. Ridley Scott may equal this film, as he did with ""Blade Runner,"" but I will be surprised if he ever surpasses it. If only all sci-fi films could be this thought-provoking, and all horror films this disturbing!",1053388800,,1640,4.819148936170213

The cast is great and has good chemistry with one another.  This is one film that will really scare you, and you will be sitting on the edge of your seat the whole time.  Not to mention that the special effects are spectacular.
You won't be dissapointed.",1045008000,,430,4.35
1222657,3,B00000ILE5,"The futuristic mothership set is somewhat laughable in this day and age, much like how Disneyland's Tomorrowland is a kitschy souvenir of retro nostalgia. But the thrills and shocks are evergreen; of course, as Ridley Scott's breakthrough Hollywood hit, it sets the precedent for his blockbusters down the road, and establishes his suspense/blown away/suspense formula.
It is Sigourney Weaver's Ripley who no doubt steals the show, outlasting the other Nostromo crew members through wits and guts.
Unfortunately, not being a sci-fi fan at all, I'm not able to appreciate the movie any more than this, but my amateur knowledge of the genre tells me enough that this is an enjoyable romp.",1038700800,,686,5.1891891891891895
1222668,5,B00000ILE5,"ALIEN received mixed reviews when it debuted in 1979--largely from science fiction critics, who accused it of being little more than a sort of ""Friday the 13th in Outer Space,"" a blood-and-gore horror flick given a futuristic twist via some problematic special effects.  But while these accusations have more than a little truth, it has been an incredibly influential film--and even today, in the wake of CGI effects, it still holds up extremely, extremely well.

The story is well known: the crew of an interstellar craft responds to what seems a distress signal, only to encounter a remarkably lethal alien life form that boards their ship and sets about picking them off one by one.  Some of the special effects are weak (the alien spacecraft and the android ""revival"" are fairly notorious).  There is little in the way of character development, the film has a fairly slow pace, and the story itself is predictable; you can usually guess who is going to die next.

BUT.  The art designs are incredible: the entire look of the film, from the commercial nature of the spacecraft to the iconographic alien itself (brilliantly envisioned by Giger) is right on the money.  Director Ridley Scott encouraged his cast to ad lib from the script, and the result is a shocking sense of realism--and the somewhat slow pace of the film and the predictablity of the story gives it a sense of relentless and ever-mounting paranoia that is greatly enhanced by the tight sets and camera set-ups.  With its odd mixture of womb-like organics and cold mechanics, ALIEN is a film calculated to send even the most slightly claustrophobic viewer into a fit of hysteria.

The entire cast, led by Tom Skerrit and Sigorney Weaver, is very, very good--and the film abounds with memorable images and scenes ranging from John Hurt's encounter with the alien egg to Skerrit's search of the ship air ducts to Weaver's terrifying race against time as the ship counts down to self-destruct.  Seldom has any film been so consistent in design, cast, direction, and out-and-out fear factor, and although certain aspects of ALIEN are open to legitimate criticism the end result is powerful enough to bring it in at a full five stars.  A word of warning, however: you'll need to send the kids to bed for this one.  And you'll probably be up half the night afterward yourself!  Recommended.

1222669,5,B00000ILE5,"Okay, this is R rated and not for kids who will undoubtedly find it too frightening.  But it is no less than a classic.  There is obvious derivation.  IT, THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE was the B movie inspiration.  The original was a very stylish low budget movie in itself, but hardly matches Ridley Scott's treatment.
I know of no other movie made before or since that has matched this film both for the science fictional impact and for sheer horror.  The mood is set from the beginning, and you know in your heart that this sure isn't STAR WARS!  In fact, one could consider this an antithesis to the Lucas films.  This is absolutely the dark side of science fiction.
This is not for the extreme sensitive, but there is a depth to this movie.  No, it's sure not a ""feel good"" movie, but those who like an occasional trip to the dark side will find this rewarding.",1026172800,,865,4.39622641509434
1222670,5,B00000ILE5,"As we all know, Alien is an excellent film and probably about the best cast i have ever seen, but to me, Harry Dean Stanton stole the show as the befuddled and uncomprehending Brett. I just really love his character because he portrays just a normal guy trying to earn some bread. the chemistry between him and Yaphet Kotto is amusing at times but always sincere. blue collar buddies. plus harry is from the midwest i sort of understood his character more, especially coming up with the cattle prod thing.
 and killed by looking for a cat!  i like the recognition that slowly seeps into his visage as he holds the alien's shed skin in his hand.. he obviously was familiar with snakes. i guess i just think he is the kind of guy you could go into your small town local bar and see playing the jukebox or buyin ya a beer.

When the parasite infects the crew members and eventually takes full form, Nostromo spaceship is under a full-force attack by an alien evil that becomes increasingly ferocious and feeds on human flesh.  Sigourney Weaver is commanding in the lead position, proving that woman are just as capable of being a hero as anyone else.  Stunning special effects and powerful directing from Ridley Scott.

1222672,5,B00000ILE5,"I can only reiterate the many favorable comments about Alien seen herein. Alien is not only the best outer space movie ever made (yes that includes even 2001), but one of the best movies ever. What is truly remarkable is how it has not dated at all. The set design, special effects could almost have been today, except today it would have been more over the top and less effective, probably. Look at other sci-movies of the period, and notice how remarkable Alien is. How amazing it must have been to audiences in 1979. Aliens, the sequel is a great nail biter action film, but the original is the true classic of cinema.
I want to make special note of the wonderful musical score by Jerry Goldsmith. It is subtle and low key enough you might miss it if the volume is low, but it is absolutely right on, and contributes enormous tension and effectiveness to key scenes, as well as a dreamy deceptively tranquil setting to others.
Why Leonard Maltin, whom I usually agree with, would not like this film, I find quite inexplicable.

1222673,4,B00000ILE5,"This  is  a  Sci-  Fi  Classic  in  my  opinion.  Hey,  believe  me,  I  am  NO  TREKKIE!!!!  I  am  talking  to  all  of  the  people  out  there  like  me  that  snore  at  watching  shows  and  or  movies  like  STAR  WARS  and  STAR  TREK  and  that  terrible  move  STARGATE  that  was  made  by  the  same  lamebrains  that  made  GODZILLA  98.  Those  are  BAD  SCIENCE  FICTION  MOVIES.  Alien  is  a  REALLY  GOOD  SCIENCE  FICTION  MOVIE.
  I  mean  it  was  everything  a  non  sci-  fi  moviegoer  would  enjoy:  the  plot  is  not  filled  with  snore  diolouge  that  contains  a  bunch  of  high  tech,  futuristic,  out-of-this-planet-and-age  crud  that  no  one  but  a  TREKKIE  would  understand.  The  plot  is  relatively  simple,  yet  interesting.
  A  colony  spaceship  in  the  not-so-distant-future  stumbles  upon  a  planet  that  they  find  an  alien  craft.  A  few  of  them  explore  and  one  of  them  encounters  an  alien  nest.  He  looks  close  to  the  nest  when  an  alien  jumps  out  on  his  face.  He  goes  back  aboard  the  colony  spaceship,  but  the  facehugger  alien  is  still  attached  to  his  face.  I  guess  a  day  later(  however  long  a  day  is  in  space  is  beyond  my  knowledge  )  the  alien  dies.  The  dude  thinks  that  he  is  OK  until  it  is  suggested  that  the  facehugger  alien  dropped  an  embreo  down  his  throat  which  could  bring  about  another  alien.  Well,  I  guess  the  crew  ignored  the  rest  knowing  that  he  could  not  give  birth  to  such  a  creature,  but  they  are  proved  dead  wrong  in  one  of  the  most  discusting  dinner  scenes(  it  is  up  there  with  HANNIBAL  )  in  cinematic  history!  Thumbs  up  for  that  alone!  Anywho,  after  that  occurs,  the  offspring  scampers  away  before  the  crew  can  catch  it.  It  grows  rapidly  and  soon  the  crew  is  hunted  down  one  by  one!
  Another  thing  to  mention,  this  was  the  first  real  horror  type  movie  that  had  a  lead  women  character  that  kicked  butt(  as  said  on  E!  CHANNEL,  they  also  said  that  Weaver  was  originally  meant  to  be  a  man.  Just  a  little  trivia  ),  because  now  there  are  plenty  of  predictable  slasher  flicks  where  ""ya  just  know""  the  young  woman  will  be  the  only  survivor.  This  movie  started  that  trend.  And  there  are  plenty  of  the  new  cliched  sci-  fi  movies  that  steal  the  premise  of  this  that  a  small  group  of  people  are  trapped  in  a  place  and  are  being  hunted  down  by  some  evil.  Those  are  only  2,  but  there  are  plenty  more.
  Well,  I  think  I  covered  most  ground.  Aside  of  all  the  pros  for  this  movie,  I  do  have  1  complaint  which  covers  why  I  didn't  give  it  5  stars.  Some  of  it  is  corny  due  to  the  age,  and  the  basic  Hollywood  thing  is  there.  But  don't  get  me  wrong,  I  did  think  that  the  ending  fit  in  perfectly.
  Out  of  the  4  star  rating,  I  give  this  movie  3  1/2",1010102400,,3052,4.299586776859504

Maybe, but being conventional can be very good, it depends on the what you do with your storyline...let's take the example of ""Sleepy Hollow"" from director Tim Burton, which has a very simple story, but the images are so nice and perfect, and dark that you can enjoy a lot more the movie than you would enjoy a very complex movie...""Alien"" is for people who can recognize good directing, and a good atmosphere, otherwise, if you prefer action, see ""Aliens"" or ""Alien:Resurrection"".

1222689,3,B00000ILE5,"The first film in the ""Alien"" series and by far the best. The crew of a mining space ship investigates a distress call, and after landing and investigating, they end up with a pack of trouble. An alien life form gets attached to a crewman's face, and he ends up as the incubator for a creature in a very bad mood. The creature is much worse than ""The Thing,"" being smarter, more aggressive and very ill tempered as it proceeds to kill off the crew, one-by-one. In this move all the men are stupid; the only one capable of dealing with the creature is the crew-woman Lieutenant Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). The film is very effective at scaring the audience (it scared me a lot), but it's really a grade B slasher move in the garb of a sci-fi thriller. The acting is generally wooden (especially Weaver), and perhaps this is why the creature was in such a bad mood for the whole movie. The technology on the ship is inconsistent-- advanced robotics and machine intelligence, but there're still typing on keyboards, and perhaps even running some future version of Windows that's still buggy. Still all in all, the film is fun, and if you like getting scared then you'll love it.

My favorite character in this movie is Parker, who has the best lines. The pacing is slow, to be sure, but it helps build up the tension and get you to care about the characters and their situations. The sometimes slow pacing is the one thing I don't like about this movie. Not that I need action to keep my attention. I like suspense as well as action. I recommend this movie to sci-fi or Alien fans, if you don't mind the slow pacing that I mentioned.

And a wide range of opinions ----from Groundbreaking and much more innovative than Star Wars, to boring and not as good as sequels such as ""Aliens."" I have watched the movie over and over through the years and believe it marks a real turning point in Science Fiction.  Not quite as much as ""2001"" perhaps, but much more than ""Star Wars."" and a lot of that has to do with settings, music, a realistic ship and crew, etc.  Do we really think our future ships will be shining stainless steel with colorful designs, piloted by highly-made-up, California=type crews, or rather kind of old rust buckets with real, down-to-earth folks just trying to make a living?  I go with the second alternative, and so do the makers of Alien. I do have a few questions after watching it so many times?  ""Why not send the shuttle down to the planet, rather than the whole ship, and why wouldn't Capt. Dallas enforce the anti-quarantine measures and back up Ripley?

1222715,5,B00000ILE5,"This is an excellent film. Right from the start the atmosphere that is generated is bleak and empty, the stars don't shine very well here, they are indistinct and faint, the music which starts the film is desolate like a cold, cold wind blowing over an empty ice ridden tundra without the comfort of the midnight sun, totally lifeless and hopeless. The viewer feels very uncomfortable right from the start. The spacehsip is a huge mineral transport, probably miles across from the size of the thing. Its black and industrial looking. The inside of the ship is lit by fluorescent tubes some of which don't work properly flickering in the bad lighting, the whole thing is very functional, no extras just like it would be in the real thing. The colours are muted and empty of joy, suffused with a putrid green. The crew is waken from stasis by a distress signal being emitted from a planet whose solar system hasn't been charted. You also get a look at the crew who are real people not cardboard cutouts, completely anti-star wars here. Tom Skerritt is the grizzled Captain, Sigourney Weaver is simply gorgeous and intelligent, her debut in a big budget film. Supporting casts include the always superb John Hurt and Ian Holm. If the score isn't enough one meets the sublime alien artwork of H.R. Giger which really exceeds all expectations, if I didn't know better I'd think he had drawn it while completely insane. As they attempt to locate the source of the beacon they discover an ancient alien spaceship also enormous and strangely shaped with amazing structure inside, almost organic like support structures and vast empty cavernous corridors until they locate a large area containing eggs which are covered in a blue mist no doubt some sort of signaling system, dinner has arrived or thereabouts. One of the crew is attacked by a creature inside one of the eggs and the tension really mounts.
The whole film is slow paced but this is intentional with a slow build up and continuous tension and humanity in the cast. Ridley Scott directs this film with his usual style, this being one of his first, this was followed later but such films as ""Black Rain"", ""Blade Runner"" and ""Gladiator"". This is by far the best of the Alien series although each one of them has its own atmosphere associated with it, such as the almost Shakespearean mood of the third one.
Superb, just superb.",975974400,,2379,4.748792270531401
1222716,5,B00000ILE5,"In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream....Those are the exact words to the slogan that attracted movie-goers to this masterpiece of science fiction and horror. British director Ridley Scott brings us an excellent story that deals with the unknown. With frightening and terrifying results. One could say that it has elements of John Carpenter's Halloween in it. In a way it does. But in this case, we are not dealing with a psychopathic or sociopathic killer with supernatural tendencies. We are dealing with something alien (no pun intended).
With a superb cast that consists of Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver(in her first role), Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton(a Kentucky native), British actors John Hurt and Ian Holm, and veteran method actor Yaphett Kotto, the film tells the story about the seven crew members of a commercial starship that recieves a transmission from an alien planet, while returning to Earth. As per compnay orders, they set down on the planet to investigate. What they find there is an old derelict starship and the fossilized remians of its crew. They also find alien spores/eggs that releases a creature that hugs to a persons' face and implants an embryo inside its victims. When one of the crew members finds an egg, he sufferes the aforementioned fate. When the embryo explodes out of the crewmembers thorax in a bloody scene, the terror begins. For now an alien is running loose on the starship and killing off the crew members one by one. Another shocking event is that the company that the crew works for has put them in this situation because they wanted the alien for its bio-weapons division. In the end, it comes down to a showdown between the last surviving crewmember and the alien. And the results are most horrifying, if not explosive.
This movie is defiantely a classic! A successful fusion of science fiction and horror. All the cast members give excellent  performances. Ian Holm gives a remarkable performance as Science Officer Ash, a crewman who is actually revealed to be an android in an unexpected plot twist. Yaphet Kotto gives an explosive if not sarcastic performance as the ill-fated engineer Parker (his death scene as well as Veronica Cartwright's is the most intense and frightening). Cartwright's performance is very convincing as her character becomes hysteric and frightened by the turn of events. And finally, Sigourney Weaver turns in a powerful performance as the iron-willed Warrant Officer Ripley. A woman who holds the fate of the human race in her hands.
ALIEN not only has wonderful special effects(courtesy of 2001 and Space:1999 alumni Brian Johnson and Nick Allder), great costumes, an excellent plot, superb actors, spectacular set design(courtesy of Swiss Artist H.R.Giger), and a wonderful,if not frightening design for the alien itself, it is a truly wonderful movie that relies on the audiences imagination. One that allows suggestibility to enter the audiences minds instead of actually showing some of the violent moments in the film. The soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith is superb and haunting. And Scott's direction even better. Many of the cast members read parts of the script during the shooting, and some did not know the fate of their characters until it was too late. They did not even see the actor in the alien costume until the scene where Stanton's character was killed off was filmed. No one even knew about the chestburster scene with John Hurt until it was filmed as well. These actual moments in filming the movie are the actors real responses. Not acting. But for real. It was this secrecy, close attention to detail, and the unique script that added to the surprising plot twists in the film. Most of the actors actions in the film are reactions to some unexpected events. That is what makes a good film. Suggestibility and unpredictability.
ALIEN is as intense and violent, if not disturbing as The Exorcist and Halloween. It plays on your senses and does an extremely good job of terrifying its audience. If you want good science fiction and horror, this is the film to watch. I just wish ITC Entertainment distributed this film(seeing as how it was made at Shepperton Studios in England).
Interesting trivia notes: Harrison Ford was once approached to play the role of Captain Dallas in the film, yetvturned it down. He wuld work with Ridley Scott again on another science fiction classic. Blade Runner.
Yaphet Kotto had developed a deep dislike for the tall actor playing the alien, and a fight almost broke between them. Which would explain his character's intense hostility towards the alien and why he wanted to kill it. Very convincing acting on Mr. Kotto's part.",971049600,,4670,4.994865211810013

1222720,4,B00000ILE5,"Since my initial review of this film about six months ago, I have seen Alien again on VHS and give it a better rating then my previous 3 stars and 7 out of 10.
What makes Alien a really good movie are the characters, all  of them well played.  They are not supermen like Stallone or  Schwarzenegger, they are ordinary working class Joes in outer space who  encounter the unexpected and behave like real people.  For instance, when  Dallas goes into the vents with the flame thrower to flush out the Alien,  he loses his nerve and panics, which is probably what most of us would do  in the same situation.
The soundtrack is excellent and really complements  many of the scenes, like when Kane is being lowered into the egg chamber.  For first time viewers of Alien, the progression of the plot, while not at  the adrenalin pace of Aliens, keeps you wondering what will happen next.  When the alien is first encountered, it is just a small parasite that  latches on to Kane's face.  After the chest bursting scene, the crew  members expect to hunt down a tiny mean little creature with a cattle prod  and a net.  The next thing we know, it is a monster at least 8 feet tall.  In retrospect, it is almost funny when Brett says of the cattle prod  ""It shouldn't damage him too much, unless its skin is thinner than  ours, but it should give him an incentive.""
While I have not seen  the DVD version with the deleted footage, I have seen stills of the scenes  on the internet.  The most famous scene is the cocooned Dallas.  If there  had been no sequel, it may have made sense to include it in the film, but  since Aliens was made 7 years later, the inclusion of this footage in Alien  would have been problematic because (1) it suggests that a Queen is not  necessary for creating the eggs, and (2) Ripley would have known that the  missing colonists were cocooned when the marines encountered the hive in  Aliens in their search for the colonists in the processing station.
The  only question I have about the story in Alien is how the company knows that  these creatures are on the planet and why they just don't send a special  team specifically to retrieve a specimen instead of using the Nostromo crew  as unwitting hosts and hence a less than certain outcome.  But I won't let  such a detail distract from the fact that this is a really good  sc-fi/horror film.",964569600,,2364,4.4392523364485985
1222721,4,B00000ILE5,"There have been a few sci-fi/horror flicks lately that have failed to live up to their potential (EVENT HORIZON, SUPERNOVA, PITCH DARK).  ALIEN does it right.  While the sequel (ALIENS) becomes more of a sci-fi/action movie,  this film is the quintessential space horror flick.
Yes, it was made in  1979 so the technology props look a little hokey, but it was still  brilliantly done.  The mood that's set aboard the ship is very well done.  It draws the audience into the fear and insecurity of the crew.  No one  knows what the thing is or how to stop it.  To this day, H.R. Giger's alien  design is one of the scariest creations I've seen.
Sigourney Weaver's  performance is, as usualy, really good.  For those of you who've seen the  sequel, the change in her character between the two films is quite drastic,  for good reason.  Tom Skerritt's portrayal of the captain, Dallas, and Ian  Holm's Ash, the science officer, are both sublty excellent.
After having  seen the second film numerous times, it was good to finally see the first  one.  It explained in more detail the backstory and introduction of the  alien race.  The action was good and the suspense had my heart pounding.  A  definite must see for sci-fi fans.",964396800,,1224,4.691943127962086

Ridley  Scott absolutely shines in his direction of this taut sci-fi/horror  thriller, carefully building the story piece by piece and allowing the  viewer to actually CARE about the people caught up in the nightmare.

An absolute must for all serious fans of the cinema. Of course,  if you're one of the many filmgoers who demand ""immediate  gratification"", have no appreciation for subtlety, nuance of  character, or complexity of plot and idea, and must be  ""spoon-fed"", skip this film and go directly to James Cameron's  far inferior sequel ALIENS.",958003200,,1114,5.401162790697675

This picture is a surefire way to feel more cosy no mater where you're watching from. There are two ways to break this  film down, the first being as the primary entry in a trilogy. On that  level, 'Alien' knocks the stuffing out of 'Aliens' by a superior approach  ('Alien 3' has been kicked around enough so I won't add to its misery here  by rubbing in the iodine) to the subject. The first film relied  wholeheartedly on tricks found only in the horror school whereas the latter  snowballed into a multi-story car park of blood, bullets and bravado. To  say that 'Alien' moves too slowly is an idiosyncratic peeve....the movie  utilizes this build-up to its advantage (you relish the terror sequences  more once you've had the luxury of becoming a little bored) while  preserving a realism that James Cameron just couldn't capture in his more  soporific magnum opus. There's just no symbolism in 'Alien' to make it  something it's not: it's just a straightforward space thriller presented on  such a slow-moving vehicle that you can't appreciate what your going  through until you watch it for the second or third time. To be sure, there  is much borrowed from Fifties 'B' certificates, but that matter is so  minute that it doesn't even register when put on the scales opposite what  this pic has going for it. Good direction, state of the art SFX (the horror  element in 'Alien' kept parallels with 'Star Wars' from being drawn in the  same way that you're not allowed to compare the architecture of  Transylvania to that of Disneyland), the use of a nondescript cast (come  on, people - what had John Hurt actually done of note prior to this?) as  well as the aforementioned protraction of plot development make for one  killer movie. This is a film about hunting and a film about hiding with you  on the hiding side, the slow areas only serving to heighten the tension as  surely as if you were lost in a video game. Get it now and wonder how you  went for so long without it.",951436800,,2087,4.572972972972973
1222738,4,B00000ILE5,"This is a modern classic which has plenty of shocks and gore. Slow in places, but the actors and acting is brilliant. Stars Tom Skerrit (Poltergeist 3), Sigourney Weaver (Ghostbusters), John Hurt (Elephant Man)  and Yaphet Kotto (Running man, Freddy's dead)
It's now considered a cult  classic.",948931200,,294,5.23404255319149
1222739,4,B00000ILE5,"Dispite the lacklust reviews, this film became a classic overnight and prove to be worthy of three more sequels. Still most momeriable is the shockingly realistic Space alien ripping from the chest of one of the crew  and dripping acidic fluids from it jaw. People still talk about Alien  today. Whether or not the formula derives from the  classic 50's era, this  movie reinvents the genre into a modern day classic with it's use of  organic styled aliens and spaceship. As for the casting that speaks for  itself. the other elements of the film all pull together for one fantastic  ride of tension. I give this one four of five stars.",941846400,,636,4.675675675675675

1222750,5,B00000ILE5,"This film is a masterpiece of cinematography, rising above the 'all guns blazing', gore filled action of the subsiquent films. The original is an intelligent and scientificly accurate trip to another world where humans  are an alien race themselves. The atmostphere is mystical and is created by  the use of subtle and ambient sound effects, rather than imposing musical  scores. Excellent acting from John Hurt especialy, but an all round good  cast. The only Alien film worth seeing.",921024000,,485,5.17948717948718

I haven't seen this version but I have seen the original several times and I even have the comic book.  A real classic and a little bit campy with the retro computer (mother) and the tech that just says 'Right'.  And the the grungy industrial interiors ...  I love it !
But I can't see this trailer bringing anyone in that doesn't know anything about the Movie or Ridley Scott (if such a person exists.)",1502582400,,466,4.32183908045977
