1332779,4,B00003OSTT,"For those expecting the usually exciting and florid performance from Bette Davis, this film may come as a bit of a surprise.  Davis is subdued, but very effective, as the wife of an anti-fascist German freedom fighter  during World War Two, who has come home to her family in Washington so that  she, her husband, and her children may have a rest from the difficult and  dangerous life they have been leading.  Paul Lukas gives a sincere and  quietly emotional performance as her heroic husband who must make some  difficult decisions to protect his friends and family.  Lucille Watson is  terrific as Davis' strong and opinionated mother, while the young actors  who portray the children are a bit stiff.  The movie has a number of  political speeches about anti-fascism that would have been appropriate  since the film was released during the War, but the strong characters and  drama of the story don't allow the speeches to dominate.  Watch on the  Rhine is an unusual film for Davis, but it is certainly a good one.",956880000,8,1020,4.775862068965517

1332824,4,B00003OSTT,"No question these times are tough times for those who speak out against the current wave of Americas Bush-Obama endless war spiral, and we may soon be entering the name Clinton in that mix, again, tough times for those who speak out against the dark clouds of eternal war that hover over many other lands, tough times as well for those who speak out in defense of basic liberties, to be free from fears about speech, about searches, and a sense of privacy. Above all as a European court recently said the right to be left alone, to be forgotten by the nosey state. Such times, tough times, breed few defenders of what is right in the tussle, the ebb and flow of human progress, and more than its fair share of evil humans, and worse, those who depend on the leavings of others evils. The instinct is to bow ones head in or out of sand, let the next door guy worry about it, or let the government hated under ordinary times without opposition do what they feel they need to do, lying or not.

But these times, our times, have not been the only times when humankind had had to search its soul and has had to take a stand by the righteous as the film under review, the Dashiell Hammett screenplay adaption of Lillian Hellmans (his lover and companion) stage play, Watch On The Rhine, from the period when in the later 1930s evil lured full-blown and mostly unchecked in the world and every conscious person knew the hammer was coming down on their peaceful little worlds and were forced to do, or not do, something about it. The theme of this film is a little cautionary tale about some people who did something, some small thing in the great scheme of things in troubled times, and about that little peek of what humankind might look like if we did not always have to hide the better angels of our natures, and other did not mock us for trying.

Of course Europe in the late 1930s was in desperate shape trying to avoid the war everybody knew Hitlers Germany (and others) were more than willing to impose on an area that had only generation before had the flower of its youth slaughtered in the trenches and battlefields of the Great War (World War I for those who came after when big-time wars had to be numbered).  As I have repeatedly noted before in this space in other book and film reviews those who fought in Spain, those pre-mature anti-fascists have always been kindred spirits. And that desperate struggle in Spain, a defeat for working and oppressed people and not just in Spain, set the background for the action in this film. If it was dangerous to be an anti-fascist before the defeat in Spain then what was to come, what state-less condition was to come would test many. Many including the leading figure here the German resistance fighter, David (played by Paul Lukas who won an Oscar for the performance), his upper-class American wife, Sara, (played by Bette Davis), and their three children who had to flee Europe and come to America before the hammer fell.

In the year 1940 though in America, far from European woes, deliberately or not, most people did not believe, or consciously did not want to believe, the European crises would hit American shores.  And so David and Sara seemed with their European sensibilities and shattered dreams a bit out of place, seemed to be relics from another time and place on these shores. Until that  hammer I warned about before came down to affect the whole family, Saras Pollyanna-ish mother and brother and their connections in the first instance when the pro-Nazi Count who is reside in the home  does his dirty work, works in complicity with the evil-doers of the word. In that sense this films plotline is fairly straight forward. A known ant-fascist fighter, once exposed as such by the Count, and his deeply supportive wife and children are to be thrown under the bus for money, or else. David, wise to the world of the hangers-on of evil knows that the payment of money will not solve his problem with the Count, and that his work will fail as long as the Count draws breathe. So in a nasty hard-bitten world where the moral options that work easily in peacetime shrink qualitatively, he takes matters into his own hands and murders the Count. Murders him for the greater good as the far as he was concerned. And that was the moral dilemma he had to face and solve. In a better world he would not have had to make such a choice but just maybe if we could defeat the fascists we would have some breathing room. Whatever else has happened in the seventy plus years since this dilemma was placed on the table we are still facing the modern version of that dilemma. And so there you have it.

Well not quite, since those of my generation, as well as my parents generation would have been all too familiar with the decisions to be made by David and Sara. But I also note with interest that this film, the screenplay, and stage play are associated with the names Lillian Hellman, the Lillian Hellman of the 1950s red scare disputes with the novelist Mary McCarthy and an ardent Stalinist during all that time. And Dashiell Hammett as well, although we honor him for his forthright stand against finking to the HUAC and taking his toothbrush to prison as a result. I need not speak of his literary works since I have long paid homage to them, especially The Maltese Falcon. What does interest me though is how the film, screenplay, play would have been written say in the period from September 1939 to June 1941, the period of the Hitler-Stalin pact when the line from Moscow to New York would have been very different. Yeah, modern times are tough times, tough times to keep a moral compass intact indeed.",1424131200,,5663,4.539666993143976

1332827,5,B00003OSTT,"Written in 1940, opening in 1941, Lillian Hellman's play was a hit on Broadway, earning  plaudits from the critics and a solid run. This movie version, with screenplay by Dashiell Hammett and Hellman (his lover), had three of the original cast, Paul Lukas (hungarian born Jewish actor, Lucile Watson, and George Coulouris. Each repeated their first rate Broadway performances, with Lucas winning an Academy Award. Bette Davis was also a solid performer although not seen on Broadway. Geraldine Fitzgerald, in a small role, does what can be done with it, as well as could be expected. Made and appearing in the middle of World War 2, the film does offer an urgent message to Americans to  recognize the kind of enemy we are fighting as well as a reminder that some began the fight years before we were forced into the War. On the whole, however, the film profits greatly by keeping the action on the family drama of a daughter, married and resident in Europe for 17 years, returning to her childhood home to allow her underground anti-Nazi fighter some needed respite from his experiences, and finding the peacefulness and security to be quietly shattered by a viper, also a guest in that home. It is a product of its era but, nonetheless, quite touching still. It is a reminder that there are still nasty things going on in the world that cannot be resolved by negotiation alone.",1418428800,,1379,4.7656903765690375

1332829,1,B00003OSTT,"Probably one of the most over-praised (and astonishingly bad) movies ever made. Flabby script, improbable plot, ridiculous dialog, and laughable over-acting, especially by Bette Davis. You know any movie that begins with strains of the National Anthem is headed for trouble. One can only opine that the critics that touted this atrocious film were infused with a double dose of patriotic fervor. One of the leading examples of the shameful dishonesty that crept into America movies during the World War.",1414800000,,503,5.3
1332850,5,B00003OSTT,"This film presented the role of a lifetime for Paul Lukas,(Best Oscar) playing Kurt Muller anti-fascist resistance member, who never lost his European accent to win a an American role, leaves an indelible image of a dignified, courageous man of the highest integrity, married father returning to the U.S. with his American wife, ""Do not say noble.."" he says in the film, just a man ""doing right."" From the start you expect to see a film unfold like ""Best Years of Our Lives,"" as he moves to the suburb of Washington, D.C.. Then in the course of an hour and a half you find out about these pre-war forgotten times when the U.S. was neutral and news about Germany was sketchy. An uncomfortable air occurs in the family gathering when another couple of questionable loyalty leads to suspicion, thievery and fear of exposure for the Mullers. With Betty Davis securing the loyal wife part with aplomb and smarts, Lukas openly reveals his anti-fascist past and stands tall and firm as he explains his opposition to fascist Germany and his life-risking family sacrifices. In this story Lukas would leave his family to do right again if necessary;nor would he submit to bribery or veiled threats lightly. That moral stand of his in the living room when one of their guests collaborates with some Nazis and attempts to blackmail Lukas, expecting Lukas to submit to fear, is one Academy award winning moment that gets broken by a shocking decision Lukas makes after his anti-fascist confession that matches Hamlet's soliloquy. Hal Wallis produced this film and the classic ""Casablanca,"" both with poignant endings, one being with Bogart disappearing into the fog in ""Casablanca."" Equally effective in this one is the slip away of Lukas as he does what is necessary beyond his family's view with no possibility of an afterlife, with no Claude Rains to link arms with. It is a wonderful Patrick Henry moment made by a European with a love of democracy who makes clear the cost of freedom and the dangers of inaction watching from the sidelines or the comforts of neutrality.",1411603200,,2062,4.860795454545454

1332855,4,B00003OSTT,"Surprisingly, this play/movie is both firmly dated in the early '40's and also relevant to today's sleepy mind-set about the world around us. We. Americans still don't pay attention, do we? The plot and dialog are expert, from Hammett & Company; the filming and editing quite good, and the score one of Steiner's best, lyrical or suspenseful as the needs of the plot demanded. As for the acting, Bette Davis, imported for her box-office reach, gives a performance which I like as much as any she's done because she's toned it down. The kids are droll but average to unsatisfactoy, Couloris as Count Teck is dastardly in a satisfactory manner, and Bette's mother and brother are convincingly  self-absorbed and naive. Their mind-set is average for the times (notice how they treat the black help), However, they serve to draw us into the conflicts unfolding in their living room. Meanwhile Paul Lukas repeats, with wonderful effect., the role he had been starring in for a year or more on Broadway. If you're still annoyed because he won the Academy Award instead of Bogie, just take another look at Bogie. In my opinion, he's a bunch of mannerisms with a short acting range. For the most prt Casablanca makes good use of Bogie's limitations, breaking out at the very end to convey a bit more depth. By contrast, Lukas can convey, in a basically thankless role--compare Paul Henreid's Victor Laszlo in Casablanca-- another good but torn human being. These are difficult parts to make interesting or likable, but like Henreid, Paul Lukas succeeds in giving us a detailed portrait of a decent, dedicated man with a messy and troubled life of overwhelming commitments entangled with love of wife and family  Like Henreid's Victor, Lucas's Muller comes alive, convincing us about who he is, what's motivating him and why we need him in the world of the 40's and also of today. In my humble opinion Paul Lukas gives one of the transcendent performances in all of movie history. Why people prefer Bogart is beyond me. I gave the film 4 stars out of 5 because of the children and the silly digression with the best friend and the shopping trip to Washington, which seems to serve no useful purpose, just wasting our time.",1395792000,,2213,4.805774278215223

1332890,3,B00003OSTT,"Sorry, folks, but I dissent. I find ""Watch on the Rhine"" a perfect example of communist influence in Hollywood in the 1940s.

A few examples from the movie: (1) making heroes out of the Soviet-supported forces who fought in Spain in the late 1930s against the Nazi-supported Nationalists (a pox on both their houses); (2) transforming, (in several impassioned speeches by the Lukas character) American democratic ideals into ideological extremism. The lines, seeking ""a better world for our children,"" in this movie translates to a world dominated by Soviet-style communism. In short, the Lukas character is driven by extremist ideology just as much as his German enemies, one from the left, one from the right. It's interesting that this movie, based on a Broadway play by Lillian Hellman, was produced in 1943, four years after the international communist movement (represented by Lukas) had been stunned by the signing of the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact, promising eternal amity between Germany and the Soviet Union. This suggests to me that Hellman, a notorious communist sympathizer, wrote her play (adapted for the screen by Dashiell Hammett, also a communist fellow traveler) in the immediate wake of the Ribbentrop affair as a means of restoring the faith of her fellow Soviet sympathizers in the righteousness of their cause and their eventual victory over ""bourgeois materialism."" It certainly plays that way. By the time the movie was released, Americans needed little or no bucking up about the evils of National Socialism, the ostensible aim of the film, and instead were given a sample of not-so-subtle propaganda promoting the eventual victory of the Comintern. (I find it amusing that Hellman/Hammett wrote some lines critical of Ribbentrop and got them included in the script. Only the cognoscenti would get those references.)

While one reviewer here praises the Lukas character as extolling ""the virtues of western democracy,"" the Lukas character is doing no such thing. The Lukas character in fact is extolling the virtues of international communism, and underlines his fanatical devotion to the cause by: (a) abandoning his family to continue his efforts and (b) shooting a blackmailer in cold blood. Who was it who said ""to make an omelet one must break a few eggs?"" I leave the reader to guess.",1351987200,2,2313,5.198391420911528

1332936,4,B00003OSTT,"1943's timely wartime drama WATCH ON THE RHINE (adapted from Lillian Hellman's acclaimed 1941 Broadway play) was a most important film for the era; and it also marked the second time that Bette Davis acted with Lillian Hellman material (the first being 1941's screen version of her celebrated ""Little Foxes"").

Sara Muller (Bette Davis), her husband Krt (Paul Lukas) and their three children have been constantly traveling around Europe for many years, operating as part of the underground anti-Nazi movement.  The family is finally able to obtain temporary citizenship in the United States, where Sara is reunited with her mother and brother, yet their newfound safety is threatened when fellow houseguest Teck de Brancovis (George Coulouris) is revealed to be a Nazi sympathiser and blackmailer...

Although Davis wasn't overly fond of the movie, she did recognize it's importance as a propaganda tool during the war years; and fought long and hard for her co-star Paul Lukas to receive star billing, though that battle was sadly unsuccessful.  The film itself came shortly on the heels of Davis's brilliant star performance as Charlotte Vale in ""Now, Voyager"", and producer Hal Wallis wanted to exploit that fact in the marketing of WATCH ON THE RHINE.  Lukas (reprising the role he'd played to raves on Broadway) received ample compensation when he walked away with the Academy Award for his performance; it's still considered his greatest acting role on film.

Davis was surrounded by a few people she'd enjoyed working with in the past, including Geraldine Fitzgerald (from ""Dark Victory""); and Janis Wilson (troubled Tina in ""Now, Voyager"").  The film also boasts one of the most amazing turns from Lucile Watson who plays Sara's mother, as well as Beulah Bondi, Henry Daniell, Eric Roberts and Donald Buka.

During her now-legendary November 1971 appearance on 'The Dick Cavett Show', Davis was asked whether WATCH ON THE RHINE was one of her favourite films.  Her reply: ""It was not ever my favourite part except for one speech, about [Sara afraid of] being alone at night.  Wallis asked me if I'd play the wife for name value, because [the film] wasn't a good risk, but he wanted to make it.  And because it was such an incredible document of that time, of everything we were going through; and of course Ms Hellman's writing is always super brilliant.  I more than willingly played it"".

The DVD comes equipped with another fantastic Warner Night at the Movies programme, so you can extend the film into a complete evening of entertainment.  Available as part of the third Bette Davis Collection from Warners, which also includes ""The Old Maid"", ""In This Our Life"", ""Deception"", ""All This and Heaven Too"", and ""The Great Lie"".",1260835200,,2737,5.039911308203991

This is an adaptation of a first-rate play by Lillian Hellman, adapted for the screen by no less than the famous detective-story writer Dashiel Hammett (Hellman's longtime lover).  Writing, acting, directing are all top-notch, moving smoothly between family issues, political beliefs, and wartime issues, and eventually demonstrating how each is ultimately and inextricably entwined with the others.  Bette Davis, Paul Lukas, and Geraldine Fitzgerald all all excellent, wringing every last bit of drama, emotion, and intelligence from Ms. Hellman's story of the rise of fascism in Europe and America's slow but sure awakening to the threat.

Long a staple of Turner Classic Movies, it's great to finally see ""A Watch on the Rhine"" on DVD.  This Warner Brothers DVD release features excellent picture and sound, several short subjects that may have been shown in conjunction with ""A Watch on the Rhine"" when it was unspooling in theaters (why a newsreel with no sound was included here is a mystery, however), the film's trailer, and a commentary track by film scholar Bernard F.

Kurt Muller works as an anti-fascist but it doesn't pay well. [What he does is unmentionable.] People suffered in Germany after the end of the Great War. Then street fighting foretold of the coming storm of Nazi rule. [An over-simplified history?] The Muller family then moved to various European countries. The conversation reveals the history of the characters. Teck snoops into Kurt's briefcase and finds a pistol, a medal, and $20,000 in currency. He calls the German Embassy to squeal about Max Freitag. Later Sarah discovers that briefcase and tells Kurt that someone opened it. The news of the capture of Max Freitag in Germany shocks Kurt and Sarah. Will Kurt return to Germany to rescue Max from prison? It will be very difficult, even if the Gestapo doesn't know that Kurt plans to return.

Teck offers to sell information to the Gestapo agent at the Embassy. The price depends on the information. Kurt worries about what Teck can find out about him. Marthe makes a final break with Teck. Teck demands $10,000 to keep his mouth shut. Can he be trusted? Will the deal be reached by a gentleman's agreement? What will be done? What has to be done? Kurt makes a speech to justify his actions and says goodbye.

The speeches show its origin as a stage play. This drama provides a snapshot of popular feeling in the early 1940s. This two-hour film drags in spots, the attitudes are dated. Were the Washington wealthy and politically connected really so naive?",1216252800,,2238,4.8077922077922075

1332943,3,B00003OSTT,"A powerful and impressive film, ""Watch on the Rhine"", based on a Lillian Hellman Broadway hit, still resonates today.  Amazon themselves have described the film admirably with Paul Lukas's towering performance supported ably by a subdued Bette Davis and surrounded by a number of the Broadway cast. The film is static, reflecting its stagebound roots, but it does not matter because it is the screenplay by Dashiell Hammett, Hellman's lover at the time, which really counts.  There are some great monologues.

The print of the film is perfect and Warner's Night at the Movies covers some interesting ground. The Newsreel, called ""Bombs for Hamburg"", while missing its soundtrack, is vivid propaganda for the war machine. Ozzie Nelson and his band are featured in a short film with 5 musical numbers one being a group singing ""Chinatown, my Chinatown"" in close harmony - delightful. The cartoon has Daffy Duck causing havoc to Porky Pig.  Daffy does a mock strip in preparation for the oven and this is hilarious.

The dud of this set is the commentary delivered by one Bernard F. Dick, a biographer of Lillian Hellman, Claudette Colbert and Hal Walllis, the film's producer. A commentary, however good the content, can not be detached from the delivery of the commentator himself. This is fair game because after all it is an aural experience. Not only does Dick barely talk about the film, concentrating on Hellman's history and somehow introducing Colbert into the discussion while panning Davis, but his blurred diction and pretentious delivery are ghastly.

The DVD is excellent value if purchased as part of the Davis Set Volume 3.",1210896000,7,1636,5.04074074074074

First off, Bette Davis took a secondary role for Paul Lukas to have the lead that he developed on the stage, Lucile Watson jumps off the screen as Bette's mother, and the children's odd accents don't even matter due to the excellent dialogue and meaning of this film.",1180915200,,395,4.72463768115942
1332975,4,B00003OSTT,"First of all, none of this movie takes place in Europe. It takes place in or near Washington DC. By 1940, Europe had been plunged into darkness. Bette Davis is Sara Muller & she has been in Europe for the last 17 years. She is married to a German anti-facist freedom fighter Karl Muller, played by Paul Lukas. They have three kids. They have fled to the United States which is still a year & a half away from war. They are welcomed into Sara's childhood home by her mother, the wealthy & influential Mrs. Farrell & Sara's brother David. They are representative of the ignorance most Americans had as to what had happened in Europe. Mrs. Farrell rules but she warms quickly to her daughter's family. In addition, Mrs. Farrell has two house guests, Marthe & Teck de Brancovis, upper class exiles from Romania. He is a Nazis collaborator & visits the German Embassy often. He wishes to return to Europe. Marthe who appears to be an American, does not want to go back. Besides, she is in love with David. The Muller's plans to settle into a comfortable, affluent lifestlye are foiled when events in Europe convince Kurt that he must return to Europe & continue the fight. DeBranovis becomes aware of this & plans to inform the Germans, thus currying favor with the Nazis. This major conflict must be decided the night that Kurt plans to leave. There is some sermonizing on both sides & when done by the children it is a bit irritating. This is Paul Lukas movie. Bette Davis stepped back just a bit to allow Lukas to shine. He did, all the way to the Academy Awards. It is a war time movie, a mellowdrama & a classic.",1142467200,4,1612,4.467796610169492

1332977,4,B00003OSTT,"Bette Davis stars in ""Watch on the Rhine"" as Sara Muller, the daughter of a well-connected Washington political family.  Sara is married to a German (Paul Lukas), and they return to America after living for many years in Europe.  Her family is puzzled by the somewhat mysterious Lukas, especially when they hear that he has been fighting fascism in Europe.  Slowly the pieces start to fall in place, which attracts the attention of others as well.

""Watch on the Rhine"" is a solid WWII film that tackles fascism in a straight-forward manner.  Obviously, the stakes were high in 1943, so one can imagine the impact of the film at the time.  Today, the film is a bit antiseptic and stagy -- exposing it's origins as a Lillian Hellman play.  In addition, the tone is somewhat jingoistic, but it's carried off with sincerity as well as fine performances and direction.  Paul Lukas won an Oscar for his characterization.  He originated the role on Broadway but was not selected initially for the film; Bette Davis agreed to take a supporting role here to give the film a star and allow Lukas to be cast.  Lukas is quite good, although he probably did not deserve to beat Humphrey Bogart in the far superior ""Casablanca.""

Although based on the Hellman play, surprisingly the script was written by Dashiell Hammett -- the only one he wrote not based on his own books.  He brings little of his film noir flare to ""Watch on the Rhine,"" although a fair amount of tension builds toward the end. Overall, ""Watch on the Rhine"" is a good 1940s WWII film -- a bit on the turgid side but well done in most respects.",1116720000,6,1600,4.595070422535211
1332978,3,B00003OSTT,"I found the movie ""Watch on the Rhine"" to be rather dated and I say this as a person who believes that WWII was a true battle between good and evil.  I guess that is the point.  There is a climatic moment in this movie where there are so many available solutions to the problem that our hero faces.  Unfortunately, he chooses the one solution that exemplified everything he professed to be fighting against.  All the great dialogue and the truly great preformance of Paul Lukas washed away quickly when I saw how our ""hero"" handled his crisis.  I'm doing my best not to give anything away for those who haven't seen the movie.  Just consider that Lukas and his family were in neutral America, that no one was apt to get away with anything funny around them, that he had been brilliant in avoiding detection throughout Europe for years and presumably would be able to do so easily again, and on and on and on.  Call me naive but I just thought that actions spoke volumes more than all the impressive words.",1114992000,4,1005,4.459016393442623
1332979,5,B00003OSTT,"The Rhine is a great European river that serves as the German border on both France and Switzerland.  Its place in the title of this overlooked classic is symbolic, as all of the action in this film takes place in North America.  The story's focus is on Germany, Europe, American isolationism, and all that they represented in the years leading up to World War II, with the Nazis tightening their hold on their power over the majority of the German people while many Germans were escaping their grasp.  Some actively fought the Nazi overthrow of their homeland, crossing the Rhine to move more freely outside Hitler's Germany.

This film is about one such man and his family.  Paul Lukas earned an Oscar as Best Actor for this film, with Bette Davis supplying her usual histrionics in support, although it is interesting to see her portray a gallant loving wife where her melodrama is understandable.  Davis, as a major box office draw of the time, insisted on Lukas reprising this role that he had originated on stage, agreeing to play against type herself to ensure the film got made, thus performing in her second consecutive Lillian Hellman tale in a row (the only two of her career, the other being 1941's even more excellent ""The Little Foxes"").  There are flaws in this film; there are none in Lukas's performance.  The child actors who portray their offspring are often painful to watch, but their scenes are usually brief once the film gets rolling.  And I agree with other reviewers here that the film is too heavy on exposition and speeches.

Nonetheless, the final act of this film is well worth waiting for.  It doesn't play as safely with its characters as one may expect from films of this era, and what seems at first a rather mediocre film does redeem itself with a tremendous payoff in spite of the anticlimactic epilogue.

Ultimately what's most interesting about the film to me is that it is a snapshot of an unsure time, an era when Hitler was still in power and thriving as the greatest threat to freedom the world perhaps had ever known, filmed in 1943 but set in 1940 when Americans strongly wanted to stay out of it...until Pearl Harbor.  Viewing this story and these characters through their perspective is an enlightening experience.  If you have a chance to see this remarkable slice of history, don't pass it up.",1114992000,3,2341,4.71990171990172
1332980,5,B00003OSTT,"In spite of its creaky melodramatic trappings and talky, static stretches, this adaptation of Lillian Hellman's play is still meaningful and moving after more than sixty years. Hellman could write crackling, passionate and original-sounding dialogue, and this fine troupe of performers brings it intensely to life. It's clear that they all believed passionately in this project and they gave it everything they had.

Paul Lukas, repeating his stage performance, plays with simplicity and passion. Watson is strong and amusing as the crusty but loving mother. And Davis, in a supporting but vital role...well, this is some of the best work of her long career. No tricks, no mugging, no over-the-top gestures that marred her later work, just intense, in-the-moment playing, with great style, always in character, unafraid to play someone her own age and a mother, and listening and reacting to the other players. This was one of the 20th century's great talents, and it shines here.",1106697600,7,980,5.24203821656051
1332981,3,B00003OSTT,"This film adaptation of Lillian Hellman's groundbreaking anti-fascist play has aged poorly since the 1940s. The plot is similar to ""Casablanca"": Paul Lukas (in what is generally considered his best role) plays an aging, weary member of the German underground, who has come to America with his wife and family, as they continue to raise funds to help the resistence at home. America is still a slumbering giant, childishly unaware of the evil depths of the Nazi threat. Lukas faces off against an unscrupulous Nazi collaborator, who threatens to turn him and his family over to the Germans, and while the bad guy is an absolute sleaze, he and Lukas share a common bond as Europeans, realists who recognize the nature of the fascism, even though their American hosts remain clueless. The stage version of this story was ahead of its time (Hellman was one of those left-leaning ""premature antifascists"" who ached for the American government to get into the war), but the film adaptation, which came out in '43, was a bit anachronistic: by then, the thought of any Americans, anywhere, being naive and accomodating towards the Germans was a bit unbelievable. Mostly, though, the movie is just way too exposition heavy, and even with a fine set of actors and a script that was touched up by Dashiel Hammett, it's frankly a bit awkward, sluggish and melodramatic. Bette Davis is fine; Beulah Beondi is a hoot. A classic, sure, and certainly worth checking out, although you have to be in the right mood.",1052611200,3,1497,4.874509803921568
1332982,5,B00003OSTT,"The events of December 7, 1941 propelled America into a war that had already been raging for two years.  Hollywood responded with a series of big and bold war films that emphasized action and the personal heroism of its stars.  WATCH ON THE RHINE was different in that the action was personal and verbal.  Director Herman Shumlin took the successful play by Lillian Hellman and placed the battlegound in a living room where Paul Lukas and George Coulouris traded ideological body blows that became physical only in the final scene.  Lukas and his wife Bette Davis are forced to leave Europe for the sanctuary of the United States, where they can live in the luxury of Bette Davis's wealthy mother.  After arriving in America, Lukas enjoys his new surroundings but is also aware that his work of fighting Nazism is far from complete.  George Coulouris is a Rumanian expatriate count with strong Nazi leanings who threatens to turn Lukas in should he return to Germany.  The best parts of the film lie in the extended debates between Lukas, who extols the virtues of western democracy, and Coulouris, who maintains that Nazism is the inevitable end of European politics.  The movie belongs squarely to Lukas, who was a deserved Oscar winner for Best Actor.  For one of the few times in Bette Davis's career, she was content with a supporting role, yet she managed enough screen time as Lukas's devoted wife to indelibly etch herself in the audience's mind as a woman caught in the middle of the old world of European politics and the new one of America's.  WATCH ON THE RHINE portrays a pre-Pearl Harbor America that allows a Nazi way of life to broadcast itself as an alternative to American democracy, and in so doing, affirms the superiority of a way of free life that lingers even unto today.",1048291200,15,1794,4.739549839228296
1332983,4,B00003OSTT,"This is a highly enjoyable, classic film based upon a Lillian Hellman play about the fight against facism during World War II, before Americans became embroiled in the war. The screenplay adaptation, which was co-authored by Lillian Hellman and Dashiell Hammett, is terrific. It tells the story of a German resistance leader, Kurt Muller, who comes to America, traveling incognito with his American born wife, Sarah, and three children, and visits his wife's wealthy mother and brother in their beautiful antebellum style mansion.
During their visit, they make the acquaintance of a Roumanian expatriate who is there as a house guest together with a his wife, a hometown girl and friend of the family. The Roumanian, a Nazi sympathizer, who frequently visits the German embassy, ultimately clashes with Muller, as irreconciable philosophical differences come to a head in a rousing climax.
Paul Lukas, who plays the noble freedom fighter with consummate dignity and passion, steals the show. A finer piece of acting is hard to find. He deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his heartfelt and heroic portrayal of Kurt Muller. It is, without a doubt, a performance to remember. Bette Davis plays it smart and gives a fine, though somewhat restrained, performance as a loyal and altruistic wife. She is luminous in the role.
Lucille Watson is marvelous as Sarah's dominant, generous, and larger than life mother. A very young and beautiful Geraldine Fitzgerald effectively plays the role of wife to the disreputable Roumanian expatriate, a wife disgusted with her husband's politics and lack of character, making her susceptible to the infinitely more alluring charms of Sarah's kind brother. The three childrem are stiff in their roles and, though affording some comic relief, are the only weakness in this otherwise compelling drama.
This is a marvelous movie that will appeal to those who love classic films. Fans of Bette Davis will also enjoy this film, provided that they do not expect a histrionic, over the top performance by Bette. This film is entirely, though quietly, dominated by Paul Lukas.",1005004800,27,2115,5.169096209912537

When the fight and ideologies become a reality in their house, they are forced to take sides in the struggle for freedom.

They're both about a heroic anti-fascist fighter (a popular motif, under world circumstances), but this movie lacks the dramatic tension and moral ambiguity of Casablanca. And while Casablanca has one of the screen's greatest love stories, Watch on the Rhine makes do with a longsuffering-wife motif (coupled with a half-hearted adultery subplot).
