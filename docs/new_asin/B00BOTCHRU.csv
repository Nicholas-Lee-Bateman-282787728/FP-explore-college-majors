5661995,5,B00BOTCHRU,"I am totally disappointed to hear that Enlightened has been cancelled! It was not even given a chance! Two seasons, seriously?! Never fails, the shows or movies that I find entertaining are the ones that don't make it. Probably has something to do with no sex & no violence. Big surprise there!",1365984000,12,294,4.673076923076923
5661996,5,B00BOTCHRU,"This is a sweetly beautiful show filled with a very complex purity.  It was one of my favorite shows. (I am extremely disappointed to see that it was cancelled this month.)  In any case, Laura Dern is just superb in her complexity and ""cuteness factor"".  And Mike White, and all the rest of the cast, along with the entire production, are just genius. So very sad to see it cancelled.....But thank you HBO for bringing us this TRUE gift for the two seasons it was on.  I am definitely buying the DVD's now.....",1364428800,58,510,4.451612903225806
5661997,5,B00BOTCHRU,"this show once again produced cringes in me about every ten minutes. this was also the effect the first season had on me.  it is a bizarre experience to watch a show with a character, dern's, who would send you running in the opposite direction if you ever spotted her on the street. this is because ever since she became enlightened due to her rehab, she became committed to saving the world and becoming a major player while doing that saving. in this second season, she ups the ante by becoming a whistle blower on the company which employs her. when she meets with an LA reporter to do the whistle blowing, i again cringed, thinking, ""oh, no, she's going to throw herself at this guy after the two of them spend time saving the world.  cringe, cringe and more cringing.

the most amazing part to me about this show though is that I've known these people, especially the dern character. I've been the friend who sits through the harangues and hears about the teachings of whomever is the current prophet for achieving the better life. i was raised a catholic, went to all catholic schools, until i went to a public university where i promptly lost my religion and never adopted another.  so I've known a lot of women with causes, almost all of them getting tied up with some abyssmal involvement with the wrong man, just like the dern character.

mike white, the creator and writer of this show, does a formidable job here.  this is territory not usually mined in tv or movies as characters who it is hard, or impossible, to like do not sell well. the show has not been renewed for a third season because of low viewing.  wisely, white did not put any cliff hangers in this second season.  thus the ending of this season will hold well as its overall ending.

5661998,5,B00BOTCHRU,"Great show.  Showed multiple layers of characters and how their lives affect others.  I found myself yelling at the screen for them to stop being so foolish and to not cross the line.  But, it all rings true.  Funny and heartbreaking.",1518220800,,234,4.634146341463414
5661999,5,B00BOTCHRU,"Season 1 was okay, and after the first few episodes of Season 2, I stopped watching. Then I came back and it and was I glad I did. After a slow start, several episodes were amazing, building up to an incredible finale and final episode.",1516492800,,236,4.266666666666667
5662000,5,B00BOTCHRU,"The critics who gave this less than a Five Star review have to come to terms with the knowledge they are now outsiders. They have critiqued the world to death. I am 65 and I continue to have a childlike sense of hope! Thank god the critics of the world haven't beat that out of me. Awesome script and acting! I was left satisfied and not wanting more because it left me with lots to ponder. However, anything else from Mike and Laura would be much appreciated.  The movie industry is a virtual wasteland.",1516320000,,504,4.361702127659575
5662001,5,B00BOTCHRU,"At first I wasn't too sure about this show,I thought I needed more,so went on to watch something else than keep coming back to it,now I can't stop watching it,I had a day off today and been watching it all day long,just took a break to write this review cos I have to let everyone know how good this show is before I start the first episode of season 2,I'm sooooo hooked on it I can't believe how much I love it,the actors are so good that I forget it's only a show and I get so mad at how everyone treats her in the corporate office,I have to keep telling myself that it's only a show,I recommend it to everyone.",1516060800,,613,4.074380165289257
5662002,5,B00BOTCHRU,"The writer and star, Mike White, is brilliant and this is my favorite thing that he's done.  It reaches in and pulls out your guts.,, In the best possible way.  The mismatched crew of office workers are relatable on an almost primal level.  I loved each character for how mad and mundane that they were.  Beautifully written, acted and shot.  The story is put together so that it has a royally satisfying ending.  Loved it!",1515801600,,423,4.573333333333333
5662003,5,B00BOTCHRU,"Love the writing. A wonderfully engaging story, I'm grateful for the opportunity to watch a thought provoking series. Thank you.",1515801600,,128,5.45
5662004,5,B00BOTCHRU,"Wonderful show, full of something rare these days -- HEART. Dern plays a complex character, full of surprises. No stereotypes here -- not her, not her mother (wow, found out that's her mum in real life!), not her ex. So great to see a positive, yet flawed, female character who's developing self esteem and self worth. Most shows about single American women portray them as insecure man chasers, on the verge of complete breakdown -- never after the breakdown. This woman feels genuine, as does her underlying spiritual/psychological shift throughout the series. I'd never heard of this show so it's great to be able to binge watch it, and see the characters and themes unfold.

Laura Dern in her 40s has never looked more beautiful. I love watching her!",1513555200,4,754,4.844961240310077
5662005,1,B00BOTCHRU,Awful and sooooo sloooow! The only redeeming thing on this show is the handsome Luke Wilson!,1512864000,,92,4.8125
5662006,5,B00BOTCHRU,"If you ever tried to break free, or rise above the rat maze we find ourselves in, you will recognize and relate to this story. The people who feel threatened and need to pull you back, the people who are comfortable in their shallow existence, or do not want to move beyond the dysfunction in their lives and relationships.
I felt a lot of sadness as Amy struggled alone to break free from it all and become ""enlightened"". To be a better person. To live a fuller and more real life. Only to be met with contempt, indifference, or to be used as a pawn for her idealism.
Amazing acting. I wish there was more...",1512518400,5,609,4.304347826086956
5662007,5,B00BOTCHRU,"Whimsical, bittersweet, and quirky with many levels of struggle, tiny triumphs and many failures. Excellent depiction of life's shifting outlooks and the struggle of trying to ""do good"" with all the cost, empathy and mistakes that exist. I loved it.",1512432000,,249,5.25
5662008,2,B00BOTCHRU,"Pretentious, needed more comedy and less annoying voice-over. casting was great and if it wasn't so much about Amy's POV it might have been good.",1512086400,,145,4.84

5662010,4,B00BOTCHRU,I watched the entire season & it's great but super depressing! Like the worst!,1510444800,,78,4.642857142857143
5662011,5,B00BOTCHRU,"What a great series! It is the best portrayal of office life and politics I've seen in a long time. More realistic than The Office and doesn't hold back. This kind of writing is too direct and truthful to have lasted. I don't know what Laura Dern has done in film in past years, but this proves she is a great actress. The angst and undying optimism of May Jellicoe, the near madness of her fight to live a sane life in a psychotic world, fires off like a deadly bullet of truth right into your heart. This is a story of a courageous woman who takes on a real dog of a company and its ""pod people."" If you experienced the abuse and oppression of the corporate world or of a smaller enterprise, this is the show for you. Either you identify with the brave soul of Amy or with the malleable, ""suck ups"" of present-day office life. The brave will love this show and the sell-outs will hate it. For others it will be a painful reminder of their experience in the office.",1510358400,6,966,4.227027027027027
5662012,4,B00BOTCHRU,"Enjoyed seasons 1& 2. The show has depth & is Thought provoking, blunt & an honest storyline.",1509840000,,93,4.529411764705882

5662016,5,B00BOTCHRU,"By turns sweet and satirical, this show will make your skin crawl with unwilling self-recognition as you empathize with and are embarrassed for its main characters. It's not always easy to watch, but the pay-off is worth the psychological discomfort. Fine ensemble work. Terrific writing.",1507766400,,288,5.4222222222222225
5662017,1,B00BOTCHRU,"Like the actress, but I dislike the series where people mess with each other.  Life is hard enough without this game added. :(",1507161600,,126,4.478260869565218

5662022,4,B00BOTCHRU,"Totally worth the binge. Laura Dern is fantastic. I absolutely hated her character while somehow being totally sympathetic to her. I really wanted to like her and cheered for her to succeed, but she just had this manipulative, annoying quality that drove me insane. It's that awesome mix that made this show so binge-able. Definitely check it out!",1505260800,2,347,5.0
5662023,5,B00BOTCHRU,"The likelihood of a 40 something yr. old, fired, broke woman pulling off something like this would be sooooo not, at least in my life.

5662024,5,B00BOTCHRU,"Love the idea, the cast, the performances! We need more movies like that! Bravo to all!!",1505174400,,88,4.5625
5662025,2,B00BOTCHRU,"The plot was somewhat interesting, but the characters... not so much.

Bluntly, the main character is a complete idiot. The supporting characters largely dislike her and she blunders through everything, making more mistakes than doing anything worthwhile. The only time she's interesting is when she flies off the handle because most of the time she wanders around being ""authentic"" and coming off ridiculously. It isn't the new age attitude that she has, either, but the complete lack of awareness of anyone else while simultaneously trying too hard to make people who already completely hate her, love her, instead of doing something more worthwhile. She's committing criminal acts but trusting everyone and anyone to keep her secrets, even people who clearly dislike her and think she's ""crazy"". The other characters are bland at best, though Luke Wilson's character actually has some dimension to him, which everyone else lacks... but he loses it in the end anyway. The premise is interesting, but she and the other characters even screw that up and it almost costs them their whole plan.

Overall, I saw it once and I don't need to see it again. I don't recommend it but there are doubtlessly people who enjoy it.",1504396800,,1218,5.024752475247524

5662028,5,B00BOTCHRU,A treasure...kept me interested and wanting more.  Highly recommended,1501977600,,69,6.666666666666667
5662029,5,B00BOTCHRU,"The writing, casting, acting, musical score, and production were all so cleverly done! :)  Everything fit together like a beautiful puzzle, with all the different pieces coming together in a creative, realistic, lovable, unpredictable and often frustrating, and awkward way (like life itself?).  It reminded me of what we loved about the long running tv show ""The Office"".  That superb cast of characters was so memorable as we cheered for some, didn't like others, but appreciated all for the parts they played in furthering the great story lines.  I was wowed that Laura Dern's real mother (Diane Ladd) was cast, as they both were so believably authentic, separately and together.  Her dog (Ginger) too - a bit annoying/cute - as it was supposed to be - and as dogs often are in real life.  I think her garden of roses also had star power lol.  Luke Wilson, terrific too!  He is my new favorite.  No wonder Amy was so attached to him as Levi, and kept connected, even when it sometimes made no sense!  Mr. White, who wrote and created and produced with Laura Dern was also so well cast as Tyler.  Like I want to google everything else he has ever done and watch it now. So good!!  And kudos to SNL's Molly Shannon for her serious role later in the series, as his girlfriend, I almost didn't recognize her!  And as for Dermot Mulrooney, from my hometown and high school in Alexandria, VA, what's not to love... he played his part with aplomb.  I literally know people like all of these characters, including the not so nice ""mean girls"" from the office that Amy tries to connect/re-connect with.  And the Boss!  Egad, too real, and also why we loved/cringed during the movie ""Office Space"", he was perfectly cast.  Laura Dern you are amazing - An In-depth performance of an earnest woman; naive, hurt, impetuous, goofy, talented, inspired, well meaning, imperfect people pleaser, reckless, angry, trusting, inspired.  All of these opposing traits rolled into one perfect role.  Amy is a total 'work in progress'.  (We've all known people like this well created composite character - the ones who goof off at work, brainstorm adventures and ideas, try too hard in some areas, don't try hard enough in others, are total winners at some things, losers at others... Think of those you know at work and in relationships.)  The recovery, health and wellness, self help themes were surprisingly balanced too; as in life, it is not all roses and sunshine, or all doom and gloom, but a quirky changeable blend of the two.  As is the search for our own 'life path or mission', which is frequently karmic soul searching with reading, listening, meditating, and sharing, coupled with all kinds of strange people and uncontrollable life events.  This show ranks up there with other iconic stereotype busting, genre blending tv shows (Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Six Feet Under, Bates Motel, How I Met Your Mother, Seinfeld, The Office, The Americans, House of Cards (thank you Robin Wright for your episode on this show, I loved you with long hair and a tan and yoga pants).  Add your own favorite best shows to this list! :).  Well done Enlightened - please more like this!!  Thank You.  I loved it.  I would have enjoyed watching soooo many more episodes!  Consider, ""Further Enlightened"" and take on corporate malfeasance AND politics.  Talk about relevant!! :)",1501632000,,3348,4.82280701754386
5662030,3,B00BOTCHRU,"This season fell flat for me after a stellar first one.  Still some bright spots, but no smiles and laughs as I did throughout Season 1.",1501545600,,136,4.230769230769231
5662031,5,B00BOTCHRU,"A gem of a show, and can't really separate Season 1 from Season 2. So great to have a full story told this way and not strung out into something it wasn't meant to be. Superb acting, so believable on everyone's parts. Highly recommend.",1500768000,,235,4.363636363636363
5662032,2,B00BOTCHRU,"I feel like this shows tries too hard to fit into multiple genres.  The voice overs at the beginning and end make it seem like it's supposed to be some deep, thoughtful, soul-search of a show but the characters and scenes are clearly chosen for comedic value.  Perhaps it would still be on if HBO picked one or the other.  While Laura Dern is a decent actress, her character comes across as vapid in her interactions and that causes a large disconnect for me from her voice overs.  I watched both seasons and I'm kind of glad there isn't more (I don't like giving up on shows).",1499904000,,577,4.364485981308412

5662071,5,B00BOTCHRU,"It's been a long time since I have seen a greater performance than Laura gives to the life of Amy. She has just the right mixture of silliness and intelligence, mixed with a fantastic sense of how Amy should be presented to present the story.

My only disappointment? The constant use of the f word. No wonder Abbadon was doomed to fail. It was obvious why the top brass was out of control; a complete lack of integrity or self discipline. In other words, whether in business or industry, anything goes, without fear of any consequences, as long as you make money and maintain power. Then if you are caught, take your fury out on the whistleblower.

Isn't that what made this story great? This poor lady, with no authority or power at all, but with amazing diligence, DID THE RIGHT THING! Without some sort of self discipline, our society is doomed to fail. Perhaps the appropriate word would be ""responsibility"".

Our society today seems to be based on the idea that if I do something wrong, it wasn't my fault, I was on drugs, I was angry, I was making money, you name it. And the authorities tried to apprehend me, but darn it, I didn't think I should be apprehended, and they treated me unfairly. A complete lack of self discipline.

Oh, I know there are those out there who say there was nothing wrong with using that word over & over. After all, it's just a word. But is that word used ""everywhere"", including out in society, or talking to your grandmother, or your priest or pastor. I don't think so. So, it is not ""used all the time"", including in any respectable business. And the constant use of the word added nothing whatsoever to the story.

In any case, I could hardly wait to go to the next episode on Amazon, to see what poor Amy had gotten herself into. I was highly disappointed when I wanted to watch Season Three, but even though that did appear as a selection on Amazon, I found out Season Three was cancelled. Too bad.",1473465600,,1940,4.453521126760563

5662076,4,B00BOTCHRU,"I really truly adored this show. Unconventional, quirky, traditionally 'minor' characters in lead roles that make you twitchy and uncomfortable at times (but in a good way), poignant, moving, socially awkward in a delightfully realistic way, refreshingly unique voices all around, and the soundtrack was obviously a labor of love. My favorite episodes were those featuring Levi and Tyler, although Laura Dern is seriously bad ass in this role, with the nuance and range she brings to such a peculiar and singular 'nobody' kinda dame, the heroine/antiheroine flip-floppy soul that she is, cringeworthy frustrating and nausea-inducing yet loveable, huggable, and relatable all at the same time. Bonus points for a show that manages to make Luke Wilson such a sympathetic, complex, warm, deep and soulful creature whilst morphing Dermot ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" Mulroney into an utterly lame and monochromatic douchewad (although he still looks awfully pretty doing it :)  I too am disappointed there won't be any more seasons, as I actually truly cared about these characters and where they were going in life... but regardless, watching these two little humble seasons was a gift in and of itself.",1472860800,6,1198,5.3052631578947365

5662105,3,B00BOTCHRU,"Gets its message across, the acting and writing is good, but the main character never figures it out.

The way they do ""hacking"" is also infuriating. They print out internal documents using the networked corporate printers and then store hard copies in their desks all the while being really paranoid that the top brass is going to figure out their game.  You know they're paranoid because they keep having extremely loud discussions about it in their office right around the corner from all their coworkers.

At one point, one of the characters starts shouting in the crowded corporate lobby about the contents of the files they've stolen pertaining to him specifically and then tosses the entire folder onto the ground, with very specific pieces of paper leading directly back to him scattered throughout the same corporate courtyard that the CEO of the company frequently walks.  This same character then has the gall to say, ""You need a good hacker, and I'm the best there is.""

A little bit more research about how computers work would have done well, but the whole story is just a bunch of incompetent people doing dumb things motivated by anger and a desire for revenge.  Nobody learns anything and the good guys are extremely unsympathetic.",1462060800,,1248,4.919047619047619

Laura seems so good at portraying this girl who is barely holding it together.

5662170,5,B00BOTCHRU,"Good ending , I loved it",1453507200,,24,3.1666666666666665
5662171,5,B00BOTCHRU,"Dang!!!! Just finished this completely outstanding, beautiful series. If Dern could get an Oscar she should have. She should have at least got an Emmy. Just outstanding and beautiful performances from all the actors. Luke Wilson is a stand out in his best acting role I've ever seen him do. Laura, I knew she was brilliant. She blew me away in Lynch's Wild At Heart. But, this girl is freakin awesome. Her complexity in this role is just brilliant! So touching and hilarious to see her struggle with her old self and new self. It was so funny and so heartbreaking and really hit close to home for me. I'm so glad the ending wasn't a total downer. I was holding my breath. For anyone who has struggled with who they are or what life is about this will give you such hope. Would  have loved to see more but I think the ending was perfect.",1453248000,,836,4.358974358974359

5662173,5,B00BOTCHRU,"If at first you find yourself annoyed by Laura Dern's immature and selfish character, Amy Jellico, just stick with it. You will not be sorry. She is a tragically flawed protagonist surrounded by misfits, the classic anti-heroine, an idealist without direction. I rewound several scenes just to watch subtle facial expressions of this top-notch cast. If you are experiencing any kind of existential crisis, this show is sure to bring you some comic relief and deep catharsis. There is no neat little bow to tie up anything, this is raw and painful and beautifully moving cinema. I cannot believe there's no 3rd season.",1451520000,2,617,5.0

5662177,5,B00BOTCHRU,"I'm SO disappointed that this show was cancelled; true, it accomplished something the last episode, Abbadon was defeated. But what I REALLY wanted was for Levi and Amy to become the family they should have always been. Not only is Luke Wilson a dreamboat and one hell of an actor, but Laura Dern is absolutely magnetic in her role. Levi was enlightened at the end, and despite all their dysfunctions they remain true and heartfelt toward each other... with all the mindless entertainment out there, why couldn't HBO have supported an actually positive influence in media?! Maybe ""ratings"" really weren't what this show was going after. Maybe HBO is just as crooked and corrupt as Abbadon. Damn, loved watching this and I hate that theres no more to watch.",1450483200,2,755,4.8604651162790695
5662178,5,B00BOTCHRU,"What a great great series.  If Amy was real she would be lobbying NetFlix, YouTube, Amazon, and everyone else to pick it up.  She would hack the HBO's executives to find the REAL reason they canceled it.  You want the truth?  You can't handle the truth!  It reminds me of the excellent show, Mr. Robot, only much better!",1450483200,,320,4.448275862068965
5662179,5,B00BOTCHRU,"Shame on HBO for not letting this show continue. I think its pretty clear by now that people continue to discover this brilliant TV  series, and they should right the wrong and at the very least give it a special or something.",1449964800,,226,4.380952380952381
5662180,5,B00BOTCHRU,The movie series Enlightened would be a great movie for Amazon to continue with a Season 3. The movie is great on so many levels. It shows young people what an office job is like. Laura Dern's character shows that a person in your past does not need to be the person in your future. Her character needs to end up with the reporter. Her ex husband is an old record that she needs to move on from. This show is better than all the pilots that Amazon has us viewing! This is a great series. Amazon should pick it up and continue it. Her character could find fulfillment in a person better matched to her. She could find another job better suited to her. She could build a relationship with her mom. This is a nice series! Please pick it up! It could be another Downton Abbey! Amazon will give this show popularity. Amazon has the power to grow it as a show in a TV time slot cannot.,1449619200,3,879,4.176470588235294

5662187,4,B00BOTCHRU,"Season 2 takes on a dark tone. The character Dern plays is annoying and awkward, cringworthy in fact. Getting evidence on Addidon Industries is the entire focus of this season with a couple episodes focusing on supporting cast. I did enjoy this show but it is hard to quantify exactly what this show is, comedy? drama? social statement? character study? cautionary tale? thriller? drama? All, I suppose.",1448409600,,403,5.029850746268656

5662190,5,B00BOTCHRU,"The honesty of the main character was so raw sometimes, it made me uncomfortable.  But that's what real life is all about and I respect the writing and portrayal for going beyond slick Hollywood and venturing deeply into the world so many of us actually inhabit.  Laura Dern was stellar and the supporting cast was amazing.  Hoping there is a Season 3!  This was great entertainment.",1448064000,,383,4.757575757575758

5662192,5,B00BOTCHRU,"Im surprised that anyone would question the cancellation, especially after Season 2 only having 8 episodes (which is something that would be intentional).  The story played out and it was obviously the end.  There was no leaving you hanging of more to come, however, I think it could have elaborated more on what happened to everyone, especially Levi and her mom.  All in all, great writing, great story and excellent casting.  It felt  almost real at times.  Anyone who has ever worked in a big corporate office could identify with all the corporate office people in this series, especially the monster boss lady heading the HR department.  I know a person EXACTLY like that with that awful robotic corporate speak.  Its the worst department to deal with in any big office, with as it only attracts people who posses that corporate (you are a slave) mentality.  HR's job is to seek out the ugly in any employee and shows how awful corporate america can be (and is?) - it brought back past nightmares.  They got that HR character down perfectly.",1447891200,4,1045,4.7555555555555555

Unfortunately, all those who have used her thus far (ok, her sorta boyfriend) are going to cash in on a smaller vision. With a few more episodes, maybe she could have taken that job and started to get to know the CEO--what was behind that almost panic she saw at the country club? How can a man so powerful operate from so much fear, and was he really so delusional? And just as crazy as he claims she was? This could have been a much more interesting story than an expose in the LA Times. Instead, she has to move back in with her old boyfriend--in a way, the perfect place to leave us--stranded at the arrested development of the passionate but un-mentored and unfunded middle-class, American Woman.",1445472000,,839,4.490196078431373

This is more of a black comedy (so be prepared) and I found each 30 minute episode provided lots of ""food for thought"" after the episode ended.  Laura Dern (who I haven't seen in anything else) is fantastic as the main character (Amy) who returns to her place of employment after having a nervous breakdown.  Every scene with Amy's mother felt like I was watching my own family!  I really enjoyed the themes of ""trying to fit in, finding your purpose in life, and encountering all the challenges along the way.""

The 1st season begins at 5 stars, but the 2nd season slumps.  Great premise, but Amy 'barely' has any real conversion.  Her selfishness just takes on different shapes.
The lack of conversion for her makes the second season painful to watch.  Maybe that's the creator's intent.  The show is very well produced with a great cast, but the lack of a personal conversion story arc ultimately makes the series unsatisfying.",1440374400,,506,4.5777777777777775

But, my gut insisted we give it a shot, and man am I ever glad I did. Superb television. I hope one of the online outlets picks up the 3rd season.

5662290,4,B00BOTCHRU,"I Thought Laura Dern was great in ""Wild"" so I took a chance on this.  Once again she plays a slightly crazy but well-meaning woman who might be attractive to some for her enthusiasm, but a turn-off to many others - because of her dramatic tendencies and stupid trespasses.

And ""Enlightened"" is all about a giant, stupid trespass. I'm refreshed to see modern day send-ups of social-justice busybodies, which this show laudably is.  If you think this show is about a righteous take down of a supposedly evil corporation, I think you missed it.  To me this show is about histrionic dead weight in Amy getting a free ride from big company employment.  And she leverages things like sick leave legalese, harassment insinuations, and other unproductive office politics to destroy the organization all while getting paid by it, and without creating anything.

Her CEO said it all at the end;  she's nothing but a hysteric who had her way in destroying the company, but if the world reflected the way she thought and behaved there wouldn't be anything at all.  And considering Laura Dern is a smart actress who portrayed her character just that way all the way through, this point of view of her nemesis is validated by the whole structure and arc of the show, isn' it?

Which is not to say her character isn't likable.  Everywhere in real life there are sweet but damaged and not terribly smart people who fall into causes and utopian agitations without really understanding the origins and implications of their new found alliances.  And they do so out of their own emotional problems and a desperate need to belong.  Erin Brokovich she aint.

And this also not to say the corporate work place is not also deservedly sent up here.  It is.  But that dimension is obvious and well-covered elsewhere in other shows and movies.

Be that as it may, the protagonist Amy surely can be admitted into the ""forgive her for she knows not what she does"" category.  And so I wanted to root for her just as someone who was really trying to build a meaningful life, and as someone who would hopefully learn some of the basics about life, reality and social behavior - even if a little late in years...  That's the good part of the show.

Its funny too because Dern's character is so wrong about so many things, but not without hope for some true enlightenment.  The enlightenment she thinks she achieved in Hawaii after her breakdown is only the most preliminary and transitional kind. Baby steps from an adult child. Would love to see how this story might continue, perhaps with real enlightenment for Amy coming to mean simply growing up.",1439596800,,2620,4.703947368421052

5662319,4,B00BOTCHRU,"I rated Season 1 of Enlightened, and for those who read my review I won't bore you with too much repetition.
This is the story about a woman named Amy, who has a meltdown/breakdown ... whatever you'd call it, at work, goes off to a beautiful island (therapeutic) retreat to get her life together, and then returns to her ""normal"" life expecting everything to be just peachy with everyone.

Amy is played by Laura Dern, her mother, Helen, is played by Diane Ladd. Amy is kind of a victim personality - never owns responsibility for anything she does, and she DOES a LOT! She thinks ... or wonders if she's become enlightened while away, and every travesty of justice demands her attention. The only problem is .... Amy returned to a broken down car, a different job than she expected (really - ""expected""!), she's living with her mother - who doesn't have an ounce of affection, and an enormous bill from her island retreat!

Amy's ex-husband, Levi, is played by the dreamy Luke Wilson. Levi has had his share of problems, which becomes evident in the show, but he's still dreamy - because after all, he is still Luke Wilson! All during the series, Levi lets Amy back into his life, every time she screws up, and needs a shoulder to cry on! It's no wonder he does/has done some of the things he does with Amy's constant craziness! Amy's mother, Helen, and Levi are about as close as fire and ice, oil and vinegar, you get the picture. Helen is, as I said in my first review, if you can imagine, like cuddling up to a Brillo pad! Not exactly winning any awards for mother of the year. She does have one savings grace ... her dog!

Amy's boss, Dougie (yep, a grown man called Dougie!), is played by Timm Sharp, and her poor desk mate, Tyler, is played by Mike White. Dougie is kind of a dicky, but he's pretty tech savvy  - which is why he has a job. Tyler is just too nice, probably lonely and very naive, and also happens to be in the wrong seat at the wrong time when Amy starts to work in this rather unusual new job.

Anyway, it's made me cringe more than a few times, but I kept watching. It ain't no Kimmie Schmidt (which is a great show by the way!).  However, I am curious to find out what happens in season 3 - when we find out just how much damage Amy's done in her most recent ""brilliant"" move -  Saving the world, by  taking on ""the man""!",1436745600,,2348,4.308390022675737

This is a testament to the actors' performances, and the directin & editing of the show. Every minute of a finished episode really seems to count. The pacing of each 1/2 hour episode is just right. Although I wouldn't call the show ""phenomenal"" or ""can't miss"" television, it is definitely engaging and fun to follow these flawed, truly human characters as each does their own thing.

5662363,5,B00BOTCHRU,"Wow... After that... I just feel... Enlightened! This show brought to light so many deep problems in our modern-day mischievous society. It tells the ironic yet fairy-tale story of a hopeful woman trying to make a difference. This show is for anyone who has lived as the underdog. It portrays all archetypes: the ghost, the trapped, the greedy, the struggling, the aspiring, and all of those hidden in our world. The leading actress does a fantastic job of compelling her thoughts and feelings to the viewer; every emotion and action was plausible and every choice was real. This show was so REAL. The finale has me on edge. Beautiful ending to such a deep and rooted story, compelling all emotion from screen and bleeding all purpose of the story: hope.",1433289600,2,754,4.8076923076923075

I love the perfect imperfection this series celebrates, and how the most interesting characters are not the most powerful, popular, or well-polished. Hurray for the awkward souls of this world who understand much more than they are ever given credit for.

5662410,5,B00BOTCHRU,"LOVED IT!!!!!!!  I can't believe HBO didn't go with a 3rd season.  It took a couple episodes to grab me and then I was ravenously binge watching. The characters and what they go through are so relatable.  It's the type of show that makes you feel like you made a whole bunch of friends.  You root for them, cringe for them, you are mad at them, you are sad for them, and now sadly missing them since it wasn't renewed.  Laura Dern is amazing as always. She plays off balance and impulsive perfectly for her character. Diane Ladd is beautiful and such a precious gift to the series. Her character portrayal is spot on and heartbreaking. Luke Wilson plays broken and jaded so well it makes you worry about him in real life.  Hope you are ok Luke, ""you are marvelous"". There are so many talented actors in this show, I could go on and on.  To top off my accolades, Mike White is the writer and one of the main characters.  What a talent!  I hope he keeps writing, producing and acting.  I also will hope he can figure out a way to get the 3rd season made.  Thank you Mike White for such a gem!",1430265600,,1090,4.217391304347826

Amy is a stereotypical idealist liberal- a sociopathic narcissist who hides behind her supposedly good intentions. She speaks and acts recklessly without considering any of the consequences her actions may have on herself and others. In the end, she screws everyone, including herself. By ""manifesting the change she wanted,"" she is left in a codependent relationship with her alcoholic ex-husband, jobless, homeless, friendless and facing a major lawsuit.

She is a disgruntled employee who didn't mind the big corporation greed and corruption as long as she was in a supervisor position. She slept with her married boss and then flips out when he moves her to another department (probably because she started stalking him).
She goes to a rehab and becomes ""enlightened"" .......until she returns to work , only to be placed in the corporation basement with the ""losers"".
She then contradicts her enlightenment and becomes wrath. She uses and manipulates EVERYONE around her in order to bring down her old lover Damon.

Would be a good pick up series for Amazon or Netflix.  If you find yourself in transition personally, professionally or spiritually and asking yourself questions like, "" Am I living my purpose"" , ""Does what I do matter?

Almost no one in this show is truly likable, but almost everyone is sympathetic, which is a neat trick. Season 2 is somewhat less satisfying than the first, but I assume that's the result of an abrupt cancellation and the need to tie an awful lot up quickly.

5662535,5,B00BOTCHRU,"I have read so many reviews applauding this series as a 'fight against opression,"" kind of movie. I did not see that even though it becomes this. My first impression was this is a very depressing series about a woman who has a breakdown...she's actually a very self-centered person who thinks all her problems are, anyone else's fault but hers. (Played magnificently by Laura Dern). She also believes her life is worse than it is and is looking for some reason to live so she feels she has to have a mission. Regardless of who it might harm. She is annoying, insensitive, obtrusive, destructive....and yet as much as you can't stand her...you know she is deep down a good hearted person, wanting to do good, even though she goes about it all wrong. The funny part is, even though I could not stand her, and if I knew her in real life I would want to ring her neck, I actually did understand her. I just would not have gone about things the way she does. Meanwhile, as she is analyzing her life and feelings...her conclusions are kind of bringing her to realize she may be her worst problem. She never quite gets there though, which is okay because I was intrigued enough to
hang on. The way she sees the world is pretty much the way a lot of us see it, we just handle things different, because we are not self-centered. Even though it is depressing and very intense, I found myself very interested watching her muddle through, and curious about how she was going to find her answers.

Yes it is about big business along the sides, but the show is really about this womans journey to find a place in this existance. I would have bet that I would have never watched it after the 3rd episode, but something kept dragging me back. I am glad because the ending is better than I expected.

By the way, all the actors did a great job. Loved looking at Luke Wilson. The only thing I did not like was all the swearing.",1424131200,3,1909,4.389830508474576

5662541,2,B00BOTCHRU,"Enlightened was a real dissapointment.  I kept watching hoping SOMETHING would happen but finally decided the goal of the show was to just make me annoyed.  Mission accomplished.  The main character is an incredibly narcisistic, bi-polar dingbat who should be sued by the company for every dime she was paid to do nothing all day but waste company time and money on her own agenda.  Her life and her mother's life are so depressing, as is the life of EVERY character in the show.  Even the dog seems depressed!  I am now depressed about the time wasted on this show.

While I have appreciate innovative programming of high integrity entertainment like Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Homeland and House of Cards the subtle brilliance of Enlightened is unsurpassed. It is ironic a show speaking about a culture of misogyny and sleeping consciousness did not get financed to continue by the same very system. It only reinforces any semi awakened individual to the fact that ratings ultimately rule programming.

Laura Dern, a wonderful actress, plays here a typically Los Angeles woman: not very bright, slept through school, totally superficial, a mess. All that's missing is the mandatory surf board and wet suit in her car trunk and primary conversation being ""Surf after work?"" Luke Wilson is also terrific as a kind-of dopey booze-and-drugs but sincere jerk. Mike West, the creator and co-star, who looks like a simpleton and plays one, is more LA - stupid and easily manipulated. Now I love LA and have lived there, and there are plenty of brilliant people there (lots or most from the Northeast), but these are the natives whose families came West from the Dust Bowl or the Midwest. This series is totally overrated. It's another example of a mediocre HBO series reviewers treat as sent direct from Heaven. Overall, the series on Showtime are far better. I do want to single out one episode in season one in which Robin Wright guest stars. She's not to be missed. She's another empty vessel filled with idiotic life advice she actually doesn't understand and she just floats along screwed up completely, a total mess, but the most staggeringly beautiful mess you've ever seen.",1420329600,,1344,4.797413793103448

Thank goodness for the very real and grounded performances of her mother, her ex, and her office mate Tyler.

5662601,5,B00BOTCHRU,"""Some pearls are never found. They hide under the sand on the ocean floor. No one knows they're there...but the pearl knows.""

The words of Tyler (""The Ghost is Seen,"" Season 2, Episode 5) remind me of this show, which has unfortunately been canceled, and Mike White's stellar writing. Both were grossly under appreciated by HBO. ""Enlightened"" was one of the best offerings HBO had, and I'm sorry to see it go. Mike White and Laura Dern both did a phenomenal job.

On the surface, Amy Jellico seems like a do-gooder, with an undercurrent of naivete and hope. Go a little deeper (pay attention to the small scenes) and Jellico spills some uncomfortable secrets. She's a woman who used her sexuality to get ahead, and then grandly manipulates the company that no longer wants her by threatening lawsuits, not once but twice. She's a hypocrite who wants to believe that she's fighting for the underdog, yet she has disdain for those who are unattractive or unaccomplished. (The scene at the party, where Amy is dreaming of becoming The Next Big Thing when she's interrupted by a former waiter at Chili's is telling...as is the way Amy views her Cogentiva office mates).

Amy's desire to take down Abbadonn becomes more questionable as the show goes on. Is she truly invested in what she perceives as injustic,e or is her mission more about revenge? Is her ""enlightenment"" a veneer for her own naked ambition and self-absorption, or does she actually care about making a difference?

During the course of the show, Laura Dern's character of Amy comes across as sad and lost, but also conniving. The character is somewhat ditsy, with no actual talent to call her own, but she becomes an expert at manipulating others into doing what she wants. She's impatient and often brittle, but there are glimpses of self-awareness. Amy is a complex character and not one that's very likable, but I still found myself wanting to know where she was going.

It's sad when an intelligent, well-written show like this gets canceled, especially when the final season leaves viewers hanging and wanting some sort of resolution.",1418256000,4,2104,4.865921787709497

She didn't improve, she didn't learn anything, she just stumbled around in the dark from one disaster to another. The show had me wishing for bad things to keep on happening to her for being such a clueless ego maniac. I enjoyed the supporting cast more then the lead. The ending of the 2nd season felt open ended, unfinished, unresolved. I do not know if they had plans to bring closure in a third season or if the writers knew they were making the end.

5662624,5,B00BOTCHRU,"The first time I heard about Enlightened, I saw a clip posted on an article that tried to give people reasons about why life is worth living. It was and still is a difficult period of my life. But the clip was from Season 1, in the episode where Amy wonders about what others do not have and how much she has to give. It is difficult to say whether I have seen a more beautiful and succinct description of hope.

I watched all 18 episodes over a span of 10 days (I was home for Thanksgiving). During this time, I met Amy and got to watch all the characters grow. There is something both simple and complex about this show. It is about change and doubt, hope and loss. It is about making mistakes and carrying on. The acting is quite possibly one of the best I have ever seen. I can't tell you how many times I wanted to physically shake Amy to stop her from being so annoying and needy. But then, I had to ask how many times have I acted that way? And that's when I understood and said, carry on Amy.

It's hard not to relate to Enlightened. It touches upon every feeling in the spectrum of human emotions. Even nothingness. The insight the few episodes give us into Helen's memories and Levi's slow acceptance of change. We learn about Tyler and how despite his loneliness and my cynicism, I root for his happiness and being less of a ghost. Enlightened can draw the hurt, shame and truth within us to the surface. It encourages you to feel despite the hazy, sunny backdrop of southern California. It understands how desperate we are to do more, to be more, to be bigger than we feel. It shows you that if someone can write about this for a TV show, you truly are not alone. It can help you end the self-pity (as it does for me). It can make you laugh and cry. It does so much in so little time. So thank you Mike White, Laura Dern, Diane Ladd, Timm Sharp and Luke Wilson. Even though it ended too soon, thank you.",1417305600,10,1915,4.201086956521739
5662625,5,B00BOTCHRU,"Wonderful end to a great story.  I am sad that there will be no 3rd Season, but the series does a wonderful job at closing up the story leaving the audience satisfied with the ending.

I really love character driven comedies. This show does a great job at taking a seemingly annoying person and teaching the audience how to love them and even root for them. We all havesomeone like Amy in our lives. That person who tries too hard and makes everyone uncomfortable. I like how we got to know her mother's story more in this season, giving perspective on why Amy is the way she is.

In Season 1 we see Amy trying to enlighten herself, humorously struggling to be a better person and get back to where she used to be. But in this season she realizes that she can never go back to where she was, she is a changed woman. Now she is on a mission to enlighten the world, dragging all of her friends with her along the way.",1417305600,,915,4.217142857142857

5662658,5,B00BOTCHRU,"I'll admit to being skeptical, based on the blurb that described the premise of this show, but it's stunning and brilliant. What a shame it was canceled. The acting, writing, direction - all of it is superb.

The odd thing is, it took me by surprise only after the third episode. I think that's largely because it created a lot of personal internal conflict. I found myself deeply annoyed by Amy's (Dern) self-righteous, self-serving behavior, but then somewhere in there, the character is so misguided, so self-absorbed and delusional, that you do feel a bit sorry for her good intentions and terrible results. That's an incredibly difficult character to write and act, that the nuances of the feat drew me in. Somewhere along the line, it made me think of how we can all be just like Amy at times, completely unaware in our quest for some elusive sense of fulfillment in a world where basic survival has to come first.

As the story unfolds, you wonder who is really worse, Amy for thinking she can pull off these grandiose, (often flaky) gestures of ""good"" or all the people around her who are apathetic and deluding themselves just for a paycheck. I think anyone who's worked a day in their life can relate to that internal conflict, even though its primarily played out in the interaction between several characters.

Without giving spoilers, all I can say is that this is the sort of rich, slow-burn character development that is lacking from most shows. If you want to understand the premise better, listen to the NPR interview with Dern and White from 2011 with Terry Gross of Fresh Air. It doesn't have any spoilers either and will give you a sense of the show's premise and intent that will tell you if it may be for you.",1415404800,,1731,4.650326797385621

5662683,5,B00BOTCHRU,"Surprised how effecting and subtle this show is. I wasn't certain I would enjoy it but found myself laughing out loud and being moved simultaneously. Brilliant ensemble who are not afraid to let ego go and play the truth of the character. The show fires on so many levels. It is a deft comedic juggling act that goes after corporate greed, capitalism, media, addiction, new age enlightenment and so many more modern social plagues all the while playing devil's advocate.

5662692,5,B00BOTCHRU,"Amy is all too human and fallible, lives in a world of her imagining where she would be a famous leader, everyone would listen to her, those who formerly rejected her or made fun of her, would hail her wisdom and see her as a saviour......it's kinda sweet, even though she unthinkingly causes chaos around her. No thought to possible repercussions for others, or even any awareness of events as anything other that revolving around her own illusionary goals. She is completely innappropriate almost all the time, and her former co-workers consider her 'crazy'.

Pretty funny too, when she imagines burning down the building where she works. No, she doesn't have any need for revenge, right???? Not her......

Anyway, very human and points out many of our own illusions and foilbles.....That idea that if we could only change others, we would be happy....it's called, co-dependency.

Makes fun of the 'you can change the world and then be important' brand of self help etc......

  I kinda think Amy is trying really really hard to get away from the pain, lostness, lonliness, and sense of helplessness, of being 'nothing', that actually came from her childhood-and then was reexperienced by later painful losses and events....She doesn't seem to know that everyone is a 'Somebody'..........

Anyway, very brave show.",1412985600,,1316,5.093023255813954

Laura Dern is a fabulous actress and I thoroughly enjoy her portrayal as a woman on a mission. The movie has it quirks and its moments, some comedy, but more on the drama side. It held my husbands interest as well as mine. We watched more than one episode at a time since I had to find out what was going to happen next. Each episode is only 30 minutes long.

5662700,4,B00BOTCHRU,"In this surreal real drama-comedy-drama series its interesting to see real-life mother (Dianne Ladd) and daughter (Laura Dern) together play acting as mother and daughter (Bruce Dern - her father , a character actor - is one the last standing king of the western movie/TV).  However that's not what makes this series a winner and worth watching,  this is a series about making a lot of mis-steps on the way to a career, making meaningful contribution to the world, friendships and finding love.  The supporting cast are perfect in their roles and realistic portrayal of the everyday we don't want to be - but  will at some time becomes.  Its the movie Clerks,  Erin Brokovich, and Lucy (Lucille Ball) coming together to tell a story about stepping outside the box -seeing one's self - in the true light - even you look a little crazy.  Worth watching. peace",1412553600,,857,4.75
5662701,4,B00BOTCHRU,"The show is just another example of how a person can make excuses for his or her actions and how easy it is to convince oneself that sometimes a wrong can make a right (whether it does or not). The show is clever, funny and sad all at once. The main character, Amy, played by Laura Dern, does an exceptional job of playing a righteous person laced with psychotic behaviors. One moment you can't believe she is so completely self-absorbed and oblivious. Then you find yourself cheering her on while she is fighting to make a change and make some sense in this crazy messed up world. The acting is believable for most of the characters. . The writing is good, but misses now and again; things are just incomplete (ex: Amy's mother's story, Amy's work environment and what she did before she left, Levi's and Amy's, etc..) Overall, it is a program that could have you contemplating at least some of your values if your on the fence.",1412553600,,929,4.502958579881657
5662702,5,B00BOTCHRU,"This series is part of the new genre of TV which I call the TV novel.  While each season can be watched individually, the series was written and planned to be watched in sequence.  This opens up a whole new opportunity for the artists involved:  the actors, writes and directors.  In this case the characters and story are developed over the course of the whole series, which I find awesome.  The actors are top notch and give nakedly stunning performances.  Laura Dern's character slinks back and forth from likable & honorable to irritating & selfish.  It's amazing to watch her navigate these waters.  What I'm left with after watching this series is a modern interpretation of a person who believes their greatest potential involves helping others.  There is the constant tension the Laura will have a breakdown and ruin everything, but that gives a very dramatic edge to every episode.  However, the series covers some extremely important soul-searching for us all.  At some points, it may seem mocking, but it provoked me to reflect nonetheless.  I was left wondering what contemporaries of St. Francis would have thought of him:  leaving behind wealth and dedicating his life to helping others in poverty & animals.  I'm sure he was shunned much as Laura Dern's character, probably deemed insane as well.  However, consider the legacy of St. Francis now.  A beloved saint/man.  We are left defining our own sense of what is good, what is worthy, what is virtuous.  What is saintly, what is holy and at what cost?",1412467200,,1519,4.8671875

I wish I could let Laura Dern and Mike White know how enjoyable it was and not to give up on it. I have HBO and never heard of it. Not enough promotion I guess.

5662737,5,B00BOTCHRU,"I can't believe HBO would able cancel such a wonderful show. Amy exposed what is truly going on in the corporate world. Hospitals are doing the exact same thing. She was so courageous in making her ideals public but unfortunately, look where it got her. In this day and age, we have to be careful of what we say to fellow employees and HR, They'll only look at you as a trouble-maker and find any excuse to fire you. We are all irreplaceable folks, so we are forced to keep our mouths shut. Is this the reason the show was cancelled so as not to entice others to act the same way Amy did ? What she did was right. Instead HR labelled her as 'crazy' and threatened to use her history of mental illness against her in court. How low can they go ? This show has received nothing but positive reviews. All of the characters were fabulous actors. The story was unique in that people don't talk about this subject but she had the balls to bring it out into the open. If HBO cancelled it then go to another movie network that will air a season 3. Why do us fans have to suffer because of politics ? I don't think it is right to call her crazy just because she was different/eccentric. Krista was never a true friend. Her only true friends were Tyler and her ex Levi. Push for season 3 and 4 and 5 Laura, you can do it ! I'm dying to watch what happens next. I'm happy that Tyler eventually eventually found love in his life.

5662743,4,B00BOTCHRU,"The storyline kinda followed what happened with the first episode, which was funny and amazing, and I thought they were going to continue with that, but then it kinda took a turn and became about something completely different, which I didn't like the subject matter as much. I wanted to see the main character develop more, not just keep moving about trying to effect change in the world - I really thought this would be about her ups and downs and journey. It was more about the character's narcissism, and how she was exactly the same as the people she hated, except on the other side of the spectrum (selfish, manipulative, fake, shallowness), her craziness and jumping to conclusions,

That said, I thought they did a great job with character development, storyline, progression...superb acting. Lots of nice turns in the plot that made it worth watching, but the flip side is that it wasn't very centrally themed.

I'm not saying do exactly what she does in the show- definitely DO NOT. But try to live by her attitude and you will be a much more calm and peaceful being.

Now I am on a mission to find another 30 minute show that is as engaging.

I liked that the settings and people in Enlightened were down to earth.  Home and work place scenes that an average person might find themselves in.  I liked that every episode ended with a different song.  It shows just how much thought went into this show.  I wouldn't consider myself a big Laura Dern fan but I liked every aspect of this show.

5662747,4,B00BOTCHRU,"This show is about a hyperactive, 40-something lib-tard who is trying to show the world she has changed after spending a few months at a hoity-toity retreat in Hawaii. I found the character annoying and dorky, out-of-touch and socially awkward. I applaud Laura Dern for capturing the essence of Amy Jellicoe and the many people out there just like her, it couldn't have been easy. I enjoyed the show for what it was and am sad it only lasted two seasons, but I can see why. The first season is excellent, but the second seems to wane a bit in interest.

5662748,5,B00BOTCHRU,"Let us ask ourselves one quick question....Why would we get rid of a T.V. show that has such a great message and wonderful actors that people can really relate to and feel like they have become a part of??? Especially the way that season 2 ended! There are so many things that need to happen in order for this show to be complete. Where does Dougie go after this? His character was a great one and there is so much more that he needs to do. How hard does Abbadon go down? What are the legal actions that are taken against Amy? I could sit down and write 5 more seasons for you, and then write 5 seasons for the new show about Dougie! Listen you have a solid fan base that is only going to grow because this show is so phenomenal! Please bring it back....BRING THE SHOW BACK!",1409097600,,774,4.166666666666667

5662750,5,B00BOTCHRU,Sometimes hard to watch as the character of Amy Jellicoe makes some decisions however... throughout the whole series there's a light that shines through and compels you to watch.. I love the episodes that focused on the other characters perspectives. Mike White and Laura Dern's writing are just a beautiful thing to take in.,1409097600,,325,5.037037037037037
5662751,5,B00BOTCHRU,"Great writing, perfectly cast. The main characters are complex and believable, while the supporting characters add a little extra humor, especially Timm Sharp as darkly clueless Dougie, who nonetheless really does wear a great shirt. Yes, there is humor, but I would say more of a drama with humor than you might expect.

Laura Dern's, Amy, can be maddening at times until you realize that this is about someone who has made a big change in their life, but it has not been even close to be fully processed. The old Amy is still there in the shadows, and the old Amy is in many ways not so very different than the people the ""new"" Amy deems self-centered and calculating. Just when you wonder if she really is *only* the old Amy, she will realize something important about life and herself. Her heart, if not always in the right place, is heading there. This brings a believable sense of hope, and the show benefits from that.

Luke Wilson's character, unrepentant as he is, nevertheless brings some needed honesty to the scenes they share, and I always was happy to see him. Good chemistry between them, too, a believable pair. Dianne Ladd, who plays Amy's mother and is Laura Dern's mother is real life, is solid and convincing, a great foil to Amy's blue sky aspirations. One wonders what doing this together was like for them, and one hopes, only good. Mike White brings a touching poignancy to his character as he reveals the pain of his loneliness, but with just enough humor and never over milking it. That he also is the main writer, producer and even directed at least one episode is astonishing. Talented man to say the least.

It's a pity this was not let to run longer, but they were given the time to wrap up the story lines, so you are not left hanging on the major plot points. Not all wrapped up neatly in bow, yet it certainly seemed a realistic and satisfying conclusion to me.",1409011200,,1894,4.548387096774194

I cried after the last episode, and when my husband (who had not yet watched the series) asked me why, I couldn't tell him, because I didn't know, or more accurately, I couldn't articulate it.

5662801,5,B00BOTCHRU,"The second season of Enlightened was even better than the first. It surprised me -- in a good way!

When I started watching the first season, it was the comedy that kept me coming back for more. It was very hard to actually identify with Amy, because her causes were all clichs, and her motives were not pure. She believed herself to be enlightened, but she was so far from it that all the normal people she interacted with seemed actuated by better motives. What Amy thought was good will to all mankind was often undisguised pettiness on her part, revenge and jealousy masquerading as a compulsion to do good. And every conflict in the beginning of the series was resolved in an inconclusive way that allowed the status quo to remain as it was. And yet, somehow, throughout it all, there was hope. It was murky and unclean and not something you could count on, but it was still there.

The second season, though, allowed for plot  points that actually moved the story and the characters along. There was character growth. There were dreams that came true. Even though the negative side of each character's soul was fully explored, they were allowed to come together and overcome their pettiness and make something happen.

I still don't identify with Amy Jellicoe's causes. I think the CEO of Abbeddon was right when he accused her of destroying without creating. I like that he was not drawn as all one-sided either. And the fact that a series like this exists gives me hope, even though I am rooting for a different outcome.

The kindest people and most interesting were the  ordinary people, all the ordinary people who know this Enlightenment Trip is just that,  it makes people more neurotic and selfish and oblivious to the world around them,  I think that was a big message of this show,

...and that is exactly why it was pulled,  it was going to start waking people up to all this nonsense , this 'spiritual trips' that are cults putting people to sleep.

 Our Corporatized U.S.  have 'rehabilitated ' the cults, and allowed them to become multibillion dollar, multinational  Corporations,  they don't care which one we join, they are all basically the same,  the same cult-thought control techniques to put us to sleep.

It was funny how caught up I found myself in the storyline and how I would find myself saying, ""stupid, stupid girl!"" or ""don't do it!"" I noticed how narcissitic she could be, but it didn't disturb me so much, because ""Amy"" saw herself as a work in progress. When she met with Mr. Zidan she even admitted that she wanted to feel powerful, but also wanted to do something positive with it.

All in all I feel that the characters were so realistic in the fact that none of them are perfect and sometimes they are altogether loveable and disgusting at the same time. I always felt like I needed to see what would happen next!",1403827200,,756,4.213793103448276

5662872,5,B00BOTCHRU,"This is (was) such a good series. Excellent acting! It was a quiet look at human life. It was painful to watch sometimes, the suffering of human striving and our need to find meaning and connection in life and to make an impact. I found all the characters interesting. Lots of cringe moments and just as many powerful, agonizingly bittersweet moments too. All resonate with truth, even when mixed with craziness. That made it so intriguing to watch! I was rooting for all of them and curious to see how their lives and relationships would unfold.
 I'm sad that it was such a short run. Tsk, tsk, HBO. I used to be so proud of your willingness to stick with a series if it was good, even if the viewership was slow to catch on. Have you lost that faith and patience that set you apart?",1403395200,,784,4.36986301369863

5662874,5,B00BOTCHRU,"As difficult as Amy (played brilliantly by Laura Dern) is for her family and co-workers to deal with, she's putting into action what she now knows to be true and natural for her following her stint at the rehab facility, Open Air. As in all major life changes it is more often messy than smooth or pretty. All the turmoil makes this viewer uncomfortable, yet if it weren't for such committed whistle-blowers, social and industrial change would happen much more slowly and even more painfully. Laura's real life mother, Diane Ladd, is great as Amy's mother. The rest of the talented cast does an admirable job with the series as well. I am surprised that the memorable Luke Wilson is not listed as a star. He's very strong in the role as Amy's former husband, Levi, with whom she's still very much in love.  I am very glad to have two seasons of the show available for viewing and am disappointed it has been cancelled. I would love to see what Amy would do next.",1403395200,,962,4.497142857142857

5662879,5,B00BOTCHRU,"I can't say enough about this amazing show. HBO should not decide to continue or discontinue shows based on ratings; if the critical acclaim is solid, the viewers will catch up to the show. Avoid reading too much about this series and just watch it from the beginning.

Oh, and something else: the color palettes are amazing. Someone really took the time to see that the lighting and colors capture the mood of the scene in ways that exceed the norm. Amy's mother played by Diane Ladd lives in a house with a lot of beige, burnt orange, and gauzy curtains that let in a weak muted light. Just perfect for her character, and the subterranean Cogentiva office is well done too as are the large bright airy offices of the Valhalla-like buyers at Abbadon, the company around which a lot of the action revolves.

5662881,5,B00BOTCHRU,"A very good show, though the main character is nuts.  The supporting cast is fabulous and rounds each episode out completely.",1403308800,,125,4.9523809523809526
5662882,5,B00BOTCHRU,"I'm still in Season 2, but this show has me hooked. I'm binge-watching and wish that it was still on the air. Dern is brilliant, as is Mike White.

At first it had me alternately pissed and laughing at the narcissistic, self-righteous Amy who seems opportunistic yet pious. What irked me was the way it seems to follow the stereotype of a whistle-blower as just a crank with an axe to grind, negating the value of dissent (a book on Wikileaks I was reading dismissed Manning this way, as well as Assange- while Assange is probably a creep, the character assassination of Manning seems secondary to the question exposing war crimes).

In the beginning, it makes acceptance of corporate corruption seem normal, and only an unhinged, emotional f-up would complain about it, and naively so. And in some ways, there may be truth to that: people with nothing to lose may be more likely to say the unspoken instead of people who have a vested interest in maintaining status quo.

But living in the Bay Area, I've seen a lot of Amys- and I'm sure many of us have. People who aren't really that self-sacrificing but just want to guilt-trip you to death. People who don't really want to do the hard work of social justice, but talk about it loudly. My favorite part (spoiler) is where she doesn't want to work with homeless people for low pay, but she's weasley enough to let her boss think **she's** homeless so she can keep the job she keeps slacking on. WOW! Yet I've known Amy's, and I've worked with them.

(****some spoilers below****)

But there are great shifts in her character, though she's deeply flawed; I love the episode ""Other People's Lives"" where she starts to slowly remove her head from her arse. I think the show is great for showing the especially lame side of New Ageyness in all of its cloying self-righteous cluelessness, yet then it makes us reexamine our own cynicism. Even when you want to smack Amy, she's pretty hard to stop watching.

Also, just when it makes you somewhat sympathetic to her, she's confronted with the question of her own motives by the very type of social justice-fighter that she wants to be: a reporter bluntly asks her ""did somebody screw you over?"" which is what we knew from the beginning, that she never would've cared about social justice before until her way of life was pulled out from under her. She would've been just like everybody else in the company, living the good life and not asking too many questions.

And the episode ""Consider Helen"" is also quite powerful. I won't give that away though...just stick with it through all the awkwardness and squirmy moments. That's what makes real drama, not lightweight entertainment and cheap laughs.

Don't write it off too quickly- there's a lot of substance here. Also, I think Dougie's line ""Stay anal, guys"" needs to be a catchphrase.

I think only Laura Dern could've pulled off this character.",1403222400,2,2894,4.703557312252965
5662883,5,B00BOTCHRU,Really hope for season 3!!! Characters are great! The story is got somewhat intense but so is life sometimes. Wished to see where the events will take everybody.,1403222400,,161,4.785714285714286
5662884,4,B00BOTCHRU,"To be honest, I am not quite sure what made me watch past the first show. But I did. And kept going. Sometimes, I was just watching for the trainwreck, incredulous that anyone could be that clueless in life -  but in the end, I found myself rooting for Amy - not only for her to win the obvious battle, but for her to find her purpose. Amy is a messed up, lovable fruitcake. Laura Dern was so believable (and beautiful) and I just loved her mom and how carefully and slowly we got to know her. Some of the characters were overly stereotypical, but I think it was a purposeful choice to make a point, to heighten the contrast between the mindless drones and the characters we get to know more personally. The show had a good pace, staying true to it's format without being too rigid but I do have to say that her monologues started to get irritating toward the end. This may be because I watched both seasons in about two days. The writing is superb, believable, hilarious, and touching, although I could have done without quite so much copious swearing. Do people really talk like that anymore? One wonders if Dermot Mulroney ever gets tired of playing the rakish, clueless, unattainable hunk?

5662887,5,B00BOTCHRU,"It's been a while since coming across a show as refreshing as this.  The main character maintains her positive attitude in a cutthroat world despite complete lack of support from her mother and duplicitous, back-stabbing co-workers. Her goal is to rise above, and in doing so finds herself in sticky situations.  Very uplifting and I couldn't stop watching until every episode was finished.",1402963200,,390,5.174603174603175

5662889,5,B00BOTCHRU,"I had this series on my Amazon ""watch list"" for months because the Dern family are excellent actors..  When I finally began watching, I fell in love with Amy and her friends.  I applaud their courage.  Being a whistle-blower is a great way to ruin your resume'.

As a nurse I've always regretted not blowing the whistle on a greedy hospital administration that placed the dollars importance over the safety and lives of the patients and their families who trusted them. I went to the union leaders but they said I should go to the newspapers with the evidence I had.

Instead I made it known why I was quitting and I left.  I heard from friends who stayed, that some appropriate changes were made that might prevent any further injury and/or deaths.",1402790400,5,749,4.593984962406015

I liked that main characters were not idealized, and rather were shown to behave in self serving ways.

I really liked it. I wish there were more episodes.",1402790400,,517,5.023255813953488
5662894,3,B00BOTCHRU,"I enjoyed the first few episodes of Season 2, but Laura Dern's character is too much to watch in one sitting of back-to-back episodes. The zeal of the main character's concern for the environment, anti-big business exploitation of lower-level employees, and fairness in the workplace is sometimes justified but mostly over-the-top--especially from a worker who barely works at all. Still, there are moments that will churn out viewer laughter. Perhaps I will watch more episodes in the distant future.",1402790400,2,501,5.3544303797468356
5662895,2,B00BOTCHRU,"I'm still not sure what this show was about.  On the one-hand it seemed to be about whistle-blowing and how one person can make a difference.  But the more I watched this series, I decided it was really a study about mental illness, and the delusional aspects of a mind off the rails.  I am pretty sure that was not the creators intent.  Or maybe it was, and they are exceptionally brilliant at developing this duality perspective?  Was Amy the only one with her head on straight, and the rest of us zombie-employees of greedy corporate hives the deluded ones?  Unfortunately, I sided with the CEO on this one:  Amy is a narcissistic hysteric: full of wild unproven, untested ideas; rudely disrupting everyone else's jobs and lives. It's all about her, isn't it?  Always having to be the center of attention; unwilling to hear any arguments except the ones bouncing around in her empty little head. The world is (literally) dead wrong, and she is the only one who can correct the situation. Even though her personal life is a disaster, and breaks a lot of rules in order to get what she wants, she has a higher calling, which justifies everything.  And yet, Amy completely misses the irony that even she doesn't live up to the lofty expectations she wants to impose on everyone else.

I read somewhere that the writers/producers Laura Dern and Mark White anticipated a trilogy. So that explains why Season 2 ends with the main character on the downside, like an Act II.  Still, when you look at the series as a whole, I can understand why nobody watched it and HBO had to cancelled it: It was too preachy, and really wasn't very entertaining.",1402617600,5,1642,4.627586206896551

5662900,5,B00BOTCHRU,"Why HBO would cancel a show with so much depth and life lessons is beyond me. This show was a true heartfelt series with real topics such as corporate greed, addiction, love, friendship and family. (It also didn't hurt that Luke Wilson was a main character).Mike White & Laura Dern should pitch this show to another network. Showtime cancelled Drop Dead Diva and Lifetime picked it up when they realized the demand of the fans was so high. If you go on HBO's website, you can see pages of upset fans expressing their disappointment with HBO for cancelling this series.

5662902,5,B00BOTCHRU,"So bummed they cancelled this show.  Only some people ""got it.""  It's a nice mix of comedy and serious drama.  It has a very political and idealistic theme where ""Amy,"" once a corporate shrew, becomes an ""enlightened"" tree-hugging shrew after getting fired from her job. She (Amy) manages to come back to work for the same company, however in a less desirable position, then begins her attempt bring down the company after learning that it's one of the biggest polluters and sells toxic products (kinda of like most big companies today.)  as I mentioned, the show will mean something to some and they'll love it.  By default, the writing and acting are great.  the series of events leading up to the finale will keep you motivated to watch.  For others, it's just left bleeding heart bologna.  I'll probably sound like a prude, one of the things I didn't like about the show (besides it being canceled) is the number of f-bombs they dropped.  It became distracting at times.",1402358400,,974,4.75

5662909,5,B00BOTCHRU,"I like that it was not predictable and that characters for the most part remained true to who they were, no magical epiphanies, changed them into completely different people.  I like that.  Most of the characters were like most of us made up of gray areas and inconsistencies.  The segments were different too.  Some were sad and depressing, others encouraging, and still others provoked anger and disappointment for me.  While some just made me laugh and smile.  Something for everyone.  Every character was well defined and each had their own little surprises.  All in all I would say if you want to watch something not from the cookie cutter mold of episodic television this is an interesting choice.  I only meant to watch the first episode one boring rainy day, the first then the next and on and on till I finished the series.  I wish it would come back in some form but alas even if it did I do not subscribe to HBO.  It's not vampires, zombies, extreme weight, or a talent competition.  It is it's own unique thing and I recommend it, for what that's worth.",1401840000,,1065,4.576719576719577

5662916,4,B00BOTCHRU,"Overall, I really like this show. Laura Dern's character is an earnest, spiritual-seeking, recovering substance abuser - and what's refreshing about the way the show is written is that, just like anyone that strives to be a better human being, she is also imperfect, and I appreciate that this contrast is conveyed. This is life! Sometimes she is SO annoying in her idealism that I gag with frustration, but I know there are people out there with similarly strong convictions and so it is not entirely unrealistic or without merit.",1399075200,2,531,4.911111111111111

Exquisitely wrought portrait of a confused woman trying to find her way in the world while being oblivious to the damage she causes around her - trying to live a ""BIG"" life and do big good things, but ignoring how she hurts the people closest to her.

From Wikipedia: ""In Entertainment Weekly's Melissa Maerz piece ""Contrarian Corner: Why 'Enlightened' is the best show nobody's watching"" she writes about the state of television and where Enlightened fits in: ""There's a general feeling among cable TV fans that television needs to be dark in order to be taken seriously. And I get that. Most of my all-time favorite shows are about meth dealers and undertakers and stylishly dressed alcoholics. So there's something pretty brave about a show that's not cynical or sarcastic or defeatist, one that's not set on a street corner in Baltimore or inside Al Qaeda's torture barracks, and still manages to be absolutely heartbreaking. HBOs Enlightened is the most genuinely moving TV show thats debuted this fall. And none of the characters get cancer.""",1383782400,2,847,5.182481751824818

Mike White, from the days of 'Chuck & Buck' until this genius collaboration w/ Laura Dern (& DISAGREE strongly about Luke Wilson, think he's terrific) is such an interesting actor, director & writer.

Still, the show ends on an okay note instead of one which leaves you hanging (like the finale of Season 1) but Season 1 was released on blu-ray, so why not Season 2?

Is HBO really that stingy that they are only going to release Season 2 on DVD? I don't even buy DVDs anymore.

If ANYONE working for HBO happens to read this...PLEASE tell whoever you need to that fans of the show would like to own both seasons on blu-ray, not just one.

Our show was cancelled. Please, be gentle with us and give us Season 2 on blu-ray. Please.

If you haven't checked out Enlightened yet, I recommend buying Season 1 on blu-ray. I watched Season 1 during a difficult time of my life, and it really picked me up and touched me. I'm sad to see it end, but both Season 1 and Season 2 are well-worth owning on blu-ray. Lets cross our fingers and hope.",1369267200,26,1023,4.335078534031414

5662939,5,B00BOTCHRU,"What can an everyday person do to help change the world?  Enlightened Season Two maps the territory in an erratic, sometimes aimless way that eventually delivers its punch through underplaying (yes, even Laura Dern and her mother try underplaying here, to great result) and some script surprises which I dare not reveal in this public space, eve though the show's been cancelled and anyone who cared for it has doubtless subscribed to HBO and gone for it.  But anyhow when the end times came for Enlightened I put aside my grudges and totally embraced the ethos of the show, confusing and arbitrary as it is/was.

I should add that some varied acting helped the pace of Season Two.  Viewers, some of us, had a hard time with Laura Dern's continual swing between relentless optimism and Nazimova-like gloom, which occurred in every episode; one wanted to reach out and counsel her, Amy Jellicoe, don't stop taking your meds just because you saw a flower in your mother's garden.  And Christa, her assistant, obdurately chipper and phony, and Mike White sitting there looking like the underside of a log in every episode, his lips twitching--well, the director made them all act this way  We looked forward to Luke Wilson showing up once in a while not because he's a better actor, nor because he used to be a hunk (sorry, that boat sailed long ago) but because he gave some relief from the one dimensionality of everything else we knew about the world of Enlightened.  Southern California is a two-edged sword in this series, one blade ripe for satire of New Age belief in self-improvement, and the other blade trying to cut through the thorny, perdurate fiber of corporate culture with its lies standing in for truth.  But Season Two brought us Molly Shannon and James Rebhorn as the top players at Abbaddon and the show got much more intriguing instantly.  And also late in the season, we got a blast of Charlie from GIRLS in Hawaii trying out rehab and failing miserably, right before he got fired from GIRLS itself, poor guy.  Yet another victim of corporate culture, meta style?  He was good in this show too.

Did they know ahead of time, last year, when Laura Dern was pushed into the bowels of Timm Sharp's Cogentiva, that the humble IT department would be put into use, episode by episode, in a Herculean effort to bring down Abbadon?  Every time you saw the word Abbaddon engraved in stone on its gleaming building surface, you were reminded that it was the name of Satan in ancient Babylonian teleology.  (The show was never about subtlety exactly--Luke Wilson's first name, for example, was ""Levi"" and his last name ""Callow.""  Mike White makes characters' names the way John Bunyan did in Pilgrim's Progress.)",1366502400,18,2720,4.782051282051282
