2156254,4,B00049QLWS,"By far not the most interesting movie I've ever seen. At times it was quite boring and the contents had a poor flow.

Why give it 4 stars you ask? After the modern Mein Kompf known as Fahrenheit 9/11 made big, people need to see that theres more to the Bush white house than is shown by a morbidly obese, American-hating liberal who puts Osama Bin Laden on a higher moral ground than our commander in chief.

If George W. Bush himself saw Michael Moore's movie he would think that America was evil and that he himself was a oil loving, baby killing redneck who would Al Qaeda and the Taliban to build a pipeline.

This movie not only shows how wrong Michael Moore is on a number of issues but shows how right America is.

The movie starts off by justifying many things the president has done (like his ""vacationing"" which was often spent signing bills, meeting foreign leaders and giving speeches rather than golf). It follows by disproving many Michael Moore's facts theories(i.e Saudis own America or that George Bush wanted a pipeline in Afghanistan so badly he'd go to war for it.) Finally, we see the exploitation of others used by Michael Moore, including the aunt of a fallen soldier. The soldier seen buried in Fahrenheit 9/11 who unlike Michael Moore went knowing the mission was right and just. Also the young man who had lost his arms (seen describing how much life sux in Fahrenheit 9/11) is telling of his patriotism, how glad he was to serve  and how much he distains being used for such a False, misleading piece of hateful propaganda many consider a ""documentary"". Oh and of course therewas the large number of Fahrenheit 9/11 bought and distributed by the terrorist group Hezbollah but that's another story.

When i see my peers talking about Michael Moore as a patriot, and how Fahrenheit 9/11 is so enlightening and truthful it makes me sick. Before you can be sure that you know whats what, be informed not brainwashed. This is why all Americans should see FahrenHYPE 9/11.",1101686400,16,1993,4.6477272727272725
2156255,1,B00049QLWS,"FahrenHYPE clearly sidesteps the more important points made in Fahrenheit 9/11 (which are of public record) to dwell on instances in Moore's film which can be conveniently played out as crowd-pleasing pro-Bush rhetoric and be easily spun to suit the needs of the filmmakers. It's for good reason that the filmmakers carefully steered clear of the whole WMD fiasco to site one example.

Like Fox News it relies heavily on doublespeak and opinion rather than facts and solid journalism to make its case. This is the modus operandi of the conservative media in dealing with unpopular truths. Questioning one's patriotism always seems a good way to gain support for something or other. In FahrenHYPE 9/11 everyone from Ed Koch to ex-Clinton mucky-muck Dick Morris try their hardest to paint Moore as a big, fat, wealthy opportunist who also happens to be an anti-American in defacto",1101686400,13,878,5.055172413793104
2156256,4,B00049QLWS,"This is a low budget documentary that succinctly lays to rest some of the incredible distortions put forth by propagandist Michael Moore, who actually thinks ""there is no terrorist threat"". As Ron Silver, one of the participants in this film explains, this mindset is a re-run of 1937-38 Europe and their attitude towards the Nazi threat. Those who do not know or acknowledge history, are condemned to repeat it.

It takes the myths in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" and dispels them with logic, starting with the ""My Pet Goat"" incident. Others include the ""Saudi Connection"", the ""Oregon Coast"" nonsense, the ""Carlyle Group"", whose biggest link is actually George Soros, and the ""Patriot Act"".

The saddest is Moore's twisted interpretation of Sgt. Peter Damon's words, used without his consent and out of context, as well as his sick exploitation of a family's grief after losing a son in Iraq. The depths Moore will sink to fabricate his ""documentaries"" for fame and fortune is appalling.

Directed by Alan Peterson, this film interviews Sen. Zell Miller, who I admire and respect for his courage and principles, as well as Dick Morris, Ed Koch, Congressman Peter King, ""American Jihad"" author Steven Emerson, and people who appeared in Moore's film, who want to set the record straight.

I find it sad that there is a segment of the population who swallow Moore's rotting garbage as if it were a gourmet meal. Rather like Leni Riefenstahl , Hitler's propagandist (though Moore is far from being in the same league as Riefenstahl as a filmmaker), Moore starts out with a premise, and splices his film to fit the premise, creating celluloid lies for the gullible, or those that share his twisted view of America.

Michael Moore has said ""Americans are possibly the dumbest people on the planet"". Perhaps he is referring to his fans, who have made him very rich while he deceives them. Please don't be one of his sheeple...read some history...see this documentary...wake up to the truth.",1101513600,80,1975,4.972727272727273
2156257,1,B00049QLWS,This is nothing but what good propaganda should be... It just feeds off people's already biased beliefs... to make them look credible.,1101427200,21,134,5.136363636363637
2156258,4,B00049QLWS,"A solid, intelligent rebuttal of Michael Moore's wildly successful polemic prepared and released in time to make a difference. The film was produced by a group helmed by the veteran political operative Dick Morris, one of the slippier characters on the current political scene, but that should affect judgment of the content not at all.

Flaws include an overreliance on right-of-center talking heads, a few of whom come across as strange, others as droners. Exceptions include Frank Gaffney, a man who knows whereof he speaks, Ann Coulter, who fires one broadside after another with all the bounciness of a twelve-year-old (no wonder they hate her so much), and ironically, Dick Morris himself, who evidently had his sincerity button pressed long and hard on 9/11. Ron Silver, the veteran character actor who has caused some dismay in the industry over the past year by acting like a man with a brain, provides a welcome dash of professionalism.

But the meat is contained in interviews with private figures misappropriated or otherwise abused by the people's tribune. These include the Florida teacher whose classroom Bush was visiting at the time of the attack, with a very eye-opening tale of media manipulation to tell, and the relatives of a dead soldier whose funeral footage was commandeered by Moore, excoriating both his

methods and message.

Above all, there's the kid whose hands were blown off in the Blackhawk chopper maintenance accident, who got to star in Moore's film with neither his knowledge or permission. This footage is both astonishing and deeply moving. Here's a guy who at a young age has suffered more than most people will in a lifetime, who feels neither regrets nor bitterness, and would do it all again if that was required. Nothing places Moore's cynicism in clearer perspective than this, the spirit of cheerful sacrifice, supposedly alien to our epoch.

A number of technical problems exist. The first two rental disks refused to play, leading to dark muttering of left-wing sabotage from friends. The final disk contained several flaws, such as the

screen suddenly turning black and white in the middle of interviews.

But though FahrenHYPE 9/11 is not as well made as Moore's opus, has no extras, and will be seen by only a fraction of Moore's audience, the old saw about substance versus flash remains true. If you want the facts, this is where you'll find them. If you want entertainment... you know where to go for that too.",1101340800,27,2466,4.985401459854015

To say we have liberty or freedom in the U.S. is a huge untruth.  Sure, there is plenty we get to choose to do, but how about all we do not get to do like when it comes to age restrictions.  How about not getting one's rights in this so-called legal system.  What a joke!  We are practically forced to pay taxes unless one gets a return.  We are asked to go to jury duty under threat of a fine or incarceration if we do not go.  I am forced to take off my hat in court.  Why?  I think we need a Statue of Unliberty on the West Coast.  I will say we have more freedom than a lot of other countries, but we are not 100 percent free.  You know what I am saying is true.  If I had my own doc, it would be called Michael Moore and Dick Morris Lie or Moore Dick Lies (you see I am doing a play on words for fun).

Among the voices was Ann Coulter who to me represents all that is wrong with the Republican party and caused me than to question the credibility of all the over politicians.  Especially since one of the movie's intent seemed to be to clear the W. of any wrong doing.  I buy that he wasn't as bad as Moore betrayed but, he wasn't right about everything.  The most powerful rebuttal came for the soldiers.  Still, I am glad to have watched the film because it allowed me to see how those on the right view things - what is badly needed in this country - listening to contrary opinions.  It was a fair rebuttal but,  it could have done better if they had kicked out the politicians and just let the people talk.",1433894400,4,1103,4.326829268292683

2156396,2,B00049QLWS,"The failure of ""documentaries"" made to criticize Michael Moore or his ""documentary"" style is that they all fall under the wide umbrella of modern propaganda film making; just like Michael's do. I am more interested in film as a way to make commentary on society or as anthropology. I am not interested in political propaganda for the right or left. As a political radical and syndicalist, I relate with Michael Moore (who has called liberals ""wimps"" for not actually doing more to support those ideas and people they champion - source: audio book guide to ""TV Nation"") at times.
Moreover though, I am just frustrated by the amount of screen time that he gives himself and how narrow of a window he provides to telling half of the story.
FarenHYPE 9/11 was extreme right wing Propaganda; it was interesting to me that they chose to make it a character assassination piece about both Clinton and Moore; which obviously, to my values is completely self-defeating. Moore is not the king or champion of the left. He's just another guy making movies. Believing that America is so polarized that if they hate Bush that they love Clinton is another totally failed concept. Even though it fails to make a point, it has reasonable production values and is entertaining (I laughed out loud at some of the logic leaps and attempts to string clips together to undermine Moore's points).
It is hilarious that the best undermining they can do is to try and ""source"" Michael's material and track down his interview subjects.

This documentary does very little to achieve its own thesis. It is more interested in raising fists on the right than it is creating a dialogue or  even a reasonable take on the facts.

I think Sam Green's Weather Underground is an excellent documentary as it doesn't let you know where he stands on his subject matter. He's telling a story and tellinig us cleverly about alternatives to voting for political frustration. Noam Chomsky is vastly more entertaining than Moore just by sourcing his material and never having to bend any ethical priniciples to crush his debate opponents.",1197936000,6,2093,4.857142857142857

Most everyone I knew just lined up to pay money to see a manupulative piece of propaganda and they just came out of the theater bleating the same bleat, ""Bush is baa-aaa-aad"".

2156401,2,B00049QLWS,"I'm so glad that I rented this movie from Netflix instead of actually buying it.

This movie barely does much rebuttal of ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" and is almost laughable at certain parts. Indeed, this documentary proves that Michael Moore perhaps did not give the ENTIRE story in Fahrenheit 9/11 in certain parts. But what this documentary does is it totally botches the story of Election Night 2000, by merely mentioning that certain ""liberally biased"" newspapers confirmed the recount was in George W. Bush favor. What they did not mention (and what Michael Moore DID mention) was how thousands of black voters (and we all know how 90% of blacks vote) were wrongfully knocked off the voters list, and how many ballots were faulty, and how Katherine Harris and George W. Bush's buddies on the Supreme Court stopped the recount. Al Gore's biggest mistake was not ordering a statewide hand recount.

Also, this documentary is EXTREMELY heavy on opinion and conjecture. Merely 15 minutes is dedicated to people talking about their experiences in Manhattan on September 11th. And merely 70% of the documentary is opinion anyway, perhaps 40% of it from Dick Morris, Clinton's fired advisor. I can only remember them using and citing actual documentation and news sources twice, the first one to show that Michael Moore allegedly misrepresented a news article, and one quote from the 9/11 Commission Report, an organization of which Bush tried to prevent the formation (an undisputed fact from Michael Moore's documentary not mentioned here).

There are two interviews in particular that were just awful. One of them was by Peter Damon. He was the amputee at Walter Reed. Moore merely had him in his documentary for 5 seconds, but Peter Damon went on to say that Michael Moore quoted him out of context and portrayed his interview as though he was against the war. The fact is if you look at Moore's documentary, he quoted Damon verbatim, when Damon simply said that he had his limbs shot off but that he was fine with the drugs they gave him. I respect Damon's service to the country and his sacrifice, but he was way out of line in accusing Michael Moore and attempting to sue him for inaccurately quoting him.

Another interview that was extremely fishy was an interview right at the end. I do not remember the lady's name. But the documentary claimed that Michael Moore ""exploited the tragedy"" of a family who lost their son in Iraq, and were angry about Bush and war in general. They claimed that this was one of the members of that family who were in Moore's documentary. But closer inspection shows that she was not, and that she's not even related to them.

All in all, while this documentary perhaps taught me to see if Michael Moore is telling the WHOLE story, it does nothing to prove him wrong. Too much opinion, not enough rebuttal. And next time, if you are going to accuse Michael Moore of collaborating with Hezbollah, PROVE IT, with either a video tape or documents. Those are the sources Michael Moore used and showed us, and you, Dick Morris, used nothing but opinion.",1184630400,31,3077,4.809073724007561
2156402,5,B00049QLWS,"This film examines all of the lies and half-truths told by perennial bleeding heart ""filmmaker"" Michael Moore. The film is hosted by former Clinton consultant Dick Morris and has a lot of great interviews discussing the reality of 9-11 and the Bush administration.

2156403,2,B00049QLWS,"Nearly three years after the 2004 election, which this film preceded, the half-truths, untruths, and innuendos which permeate it are extraordinarily obvious.  Rather than presenting a rebuttal to Michael Moore's film ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", 99% of this effort is devoted to attacking Michael Moore--while blaming anything bad that has happened in the world of late on Bill Clinton.

In its defense, this film DOES reveal and explain one significant inaccuracy in Michael Moore's film.  This seems almost accidental as the various participants proceed to ask questions about ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", then provide responses to an almost unrelated matter (often one on which Moore was silent).  Many arguments are left unsupported by sources or substantiating facts (Moore, whatever one may think of him, did generally ""show his work"").  Moore is compared variously to Leni Riefenstahl and Tokyo Rose, and when all else fails, Ann Coulter pops in to say something angry which, more often than not, is utterly irrelevant.  Among the sources cited for ""facts"" presented here is The Washington Times, owned by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon and as one might guess, hardly noted for objectivity.

Claims that the Veteran's Administration is providing excellent care to wounded servicepeople seem almost ridiculous in light of the recent Walter Reed scandal.  Claims by various service families and relatives that they were somehow ""exploited"" by Moore sound more like sour grapes than legitimate complaints (were they filmed without permission?  If so, where are the lawsuits?). And so on and so on and so on.

This film, along with Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", would be most entertaining viewing just prior to the next presidential election.  This example in particular illustrates beautifully how ""factoids"" can be manupulated into ""the truth"".  Pay attention to this film--and remember, they'll be trying to play the very same tricks in 2008.  Watch closely and you just might catch them at it next time.",1181260800,4,1980,5.327974276527331

2156405,3,B00049QLWS,"Good to watch so as to see different views on the subjects. And like average reviewers, I do not have time to launch my own research so I watch both Fahrenhype and Fahrenheit with equal skepticism.

Something I like: Arguments on the Afghan pipeline and the Pantagraph

Not a very good rebuttal in terms of justifying the war on Iraq. Too much time spent on arguing the statement ""There is no terrorist threat."" Michael Moore also questions the insufficient effort in Afghan taken by us on hunting down those terrorist. The main messages he carries are summarized in the very last narration: how the underprivileged have given us their great gifts by serving the country, which protects the very system which had left them with not many choices other than the military. And all they ask for is that they don't have to sacrifice until it's absolutely necessary. In this regard, Fahrenhype 9/11 does not offer a good rebuttal. In my opinion having a couple military people stand up for  their opinions and challenging Moore does not represent everyone from the military. This makes Fahrenhype 9/11 an equal propaganda.

Rebuttal regarding our president response at the school: THANKS to Fahrenhype 9/11 now I understand that in fact our president acknowledged the 1st plane hitting the tower before he even stepped into the classroom. [Note that when he was informed by the agent within the classroom that's when the SECOND plane hit] And he sat for another 6, 7, 8 minutes.... If Fahrenhype 9/11 argued that he was told not to do anything at that point - what's our president for? (He is supposed to do whatever he was told to do?) And if Fahrenhype argues that the 6, 7, 8 minutes are insignificant. How much time did the 9/11 victims have? About 15 minutes between the second and the first plane hit. And about 50 minutes before the tower collapsed.. That's all the time they had, and we're talking about thousands of human lives. Fahrenhype 9/11 does not offer any better explanation for our president/agency response on that day.

And sorry my brain does not register whenever Ann Coulter speaks. Fahrenhype would have been better off without her opinions.

After all, Fahrenhype is still worth watching in my opinion. But we need to watch it with caution and skeptcism. Try to look for the FACT, and know that it only offers just another side of the story.",1166918400,6,2360,4.7862407862407865
2156406,4,B00049QLWS,"Moore's terribly slanted movie was soooo biased that I refused to even pay a rental fee for fear that some of that hard earned money of mine might go into his pockets. Luckly my g/f was a manager at Blockbuster and we get a few movies a week in advance to watch for free so that she can be up to date on the new releases. In this way I finally watched the worst propaganda film since Tokyo Rose perhaps.

It was so slanted I almost couldn't watch it. I haven't been that mad and enraged at a movie since I watched ""Dirty Pictures"", starring James Woods, about the Mapplethorp exhibit in Cincinnati.

Though this 'compliment', if you will, to Moore's movie should be displayed right next to his but typically you find it buried somewhere else in the store. If anything, regardless of politics, you would think that a retailer would want to put this out for sales would be triple than what they are now.

The best line in this documentary is by actor Ron Silver. Who also narrates it. ""You give me enough footage of Michael Moore in enough situations and I could make him look like an anorexic Right Winger."" Best said!

Either way, I highly recommend anyone to buy this for any Right Winger or anti-Moore supporter. Not to mention, why not have the other side spoken for eh? More on the review of this DVD at my site, [...] -ST",1166745600,5,1326,4.378048780487805
2156407,4,B00049QLWS,"I gave this 4 stars.  Why?  Yes, it lacked a lot and if it was just about pitting fact against fact then it would have gotten a 3.  But the most important fact of all is that Moore took statements of common people, the most reliable witnesses and twisted them into something all his own.  This production was a hurried rebuttal to a slanted production by a slanted man with an agenda.  Michael Moore is a man who has made his life and living off of nothing more than the tragedies of others.  Running like an ambulance chaser from one disaster to another.  Columbine.  Layoffs.  9/11.  He has criticism, but he has no answers.  Only sad comedy if there is such a thing.  I've never read a single story of him taking a single dime of the wealth he earned off the misery of others and using it to help them in anyway.

I would have liked to given this movie more stars based solely on the reason it was made.  This production was made mostly as an emotional response and outrage toward a man who manipulated the truth for his own agenda.  This production was never about money or academy awards or fame.  Anyone involved in producing or filming it knows that.  The persons who made it rushed it as a timely rebuttal and didn't have time to dig in and find all the little facts that dispelled all the lies that Moore wove in with his truths.  Hype found some of the biggest ones and filled in the rest with the emotion, commentary, recognizable faces and pundits.  They wanted to strike while the iron was hot.  But just because they had some ""illuminaries"" on the film that provide controversy and opinions doesn't diminish the accuracies they portrayed and if you're compelled to watch Moore's film and filter out the truth from the lies, then you should be equally compelled to watch this production and do the same.  Otherwise, you're a follower and a fish that swallows the food hook line and sinker.  The one star reviewers who tuned into this film and hated the whole thing because it's pro-Bush are as bad as the pro-Bushers who loved it for nothing more than being pro-Bush.

Next off, for the pompous casual reviewer and other's like him who asked ,""what did the soldier expect who allowed himself to be interviewed by Moore?""  I'll tell you what he expected.  He expected a chance to tell his story and not have his story raped and misrepresented for profit, and he expected the people who interviewed him in Moore's stead to represent themselves as who they really were.  He expected to come home after giving parts of his body up to get treated with a modicum of respect over what he gave away.  The kind of respect the vast majority of decent people in this country are inclined to give.  Instead, under Moore's direction, hired people with little self respect put money above personal integrity and misrepresented themselves as people who just wanted to tell a person's tale of pain and sacrifice.  I was interviewed for FarenHYPE and expected the same.  They gave me that respect.  And that is the difference between the two productions and the people behind them.  You can talk about pundits and media darlings and presidents and their opinions all you want.  But the comments of people like the soldier who were actually there and the witnesses to events are the real story and the truth no matter what it says should be told for better or worse.  The producers of HYPE didn't twist what I had to say.  They stayed true to what they represented when they approached.  I pointedly asked their purpose, they told me and they kept their promise, unlike Moore and his henchmen.  Furthermoore, there is no such thing in any story or production as signing some sort of waiver requiring anyone to tell it the exact way you want them to tell it.  If you feel that no-one should ever take an interview for fear of being slandered or misrepresented then you better get used to putting all documentaries and movies and tv shows of any intelligence aside and prepare yourself for nothing but endless reruns of ""Animal Planet Presents....""  Be prepared to sit there in your chair in front of the TV mesmerized by butterflies as they land on leaves and branches.  Extremely pretentious of you and demonstrates the pompousness of a person who thinks they are so smart that they can ""never get taken.""  Right.  Your type is the perfect target of deceptive shamsters because you know all their tricks apparently.  Having probably never been interviewed yourself or spent anywhere near a production of any sort, you are yet filled with some vast untapped well of knowledge about it all.  You're perfect Moore material...ready to have strangers approach you, swear they're not associated with Moore, have them sign a paper and hold it in your hand while you spill your guts to the world.  Yeah, great job...he'll find the ""free footage"" others made then chop you to shreds anyway.  You're the bold Monday morning quarterback sitting there in a lazyboy, critiquing the game with endless reruns a week after it was played.  Good job.  Well, you're not the quarterback and that's the reason guys like you never get interviewed.  You should do as well as that soldier did and you d*mn sure oughta be critizing Moore a lot more than him. Instead, you attack the victim.  Tell em how stupid they were for getting shot or carjacked.  Next time, spend a bit more time going after the criminal before he does the same to you ok?  Yeah, you're pretty ignorant and your comments piss me off and it shows.

As far as Fahrenhype?  Yes, it was an emotional response, slanted toward the side of emotional people filled with outrage and disgust at the slander of good people, soldiers and other witnesses.  Not just slander at politicians.  Moore slandered the most basic truths.  Both sides may have been guilty of imperfect presentations but Moore's deception was the guiltiest of all by far.  You can be disgusted at the Ann Coulters and Dick Moriss's of the world all you want and whine about their musings, but if that is where you are offended the most, then your morals are cheap to me because when people like Moore take the footage of the average person, actual witnesses with the real story and the real truth and twist it into something else, that is the lowest form of a living organism I can think of.  At least Fahrenhype actually portrayed the real thoughts and opinions of the people who were actually there.  Not fabrications.

The Fahrenhype project was filmed and completed in an amazingly short time.  Far less than the amount of time Moore had to film.  And BY FAR, with less money.  It had one purpose and believe me, it wasn't about making money as with Moore's film.  The people who poney'd up the money never expected academy awards or accolades or riches or political favors.  It was a direct emotional response to an emotional outrage.  They didn't have the time or money to find all the nifty little facts when they made the film.  They didn't even have time to meticulously cut and edit each inch of footage.  Just time to make a statement on some of the more basic things.  You want perfect facts?  Then dig deeper and quit stopping short at 90 minute documentaries.  If nothing else, this movie demonstrated that you can't rely on Michael Moore for the truth.  Or even this movie if you want the whole perfect truth.  You don't have to sit on one extreme or the other.  To the three star reviewers, you have my respect.  To the people that gave it 5 stars on nothing more than a rebuttal to a despicable ambulance chaser, you have my respect also.  To the 5 star reviewers who love it because of blind alliegance to Bush?  Well wake up and think for yourselves.  He isn't worthy of 5 star respect by any means.  To you one star reviewers who gave it one star over nothing more than hatred of Bush?  You're as shallow as Bush himself.  At least rate it better than one star because this film exposed Bush's twin brother in many respects.  They both twist the truth and serve their own self interests.

I follow neither Michael Moore or George Bush.  I think they are both men that serve their own interests.  Most people who are at center stage on these issues are out of touch with reality.  I work in government...a branch that is supposed to preserve and protect this nation (not the military) and I can tell you that just as with FEMA, the people at the top live in a dream world and have no concept of reality.  Incompetent Presidents surround themselves with incompetent people that support their agenda.  They either have no experience or they don't have the guts to use it.  As with Brown at FEMA, what did we get?  A former executive of Pepsico.  Great credentials.  But that's what they are.  Bush wanted to appoint who to the Supreme Court?  A life long friend who had never spent day one in a judge's chair...to represent the most powerful court in the land?  Bout says it all.  The top people in governemnt today as a whole don't want to prepare or act or take measures, they want to meet and talk about what they might do if disaster strikes.  If you want to be preserved and saved from danger and all manner of uncomfort, you best start preparing to do it yourself because this government won't do it for you.  And neither will the Michael Moore's of the world.  If Moore or Bush is your idol or your savior then you're hanging your hat on a world of hurt.  You're a fool.  If you believe some activist movie star will save you, again, you're a fool.  If you believe the people who advocate nothing but peace in the world or the people who advocate nothing but terrorism in the world will save you, again, you're a fool.  You can choose to follow and be spoon fed or you can choose to prepare and protect yourself because none of these  fools will be anywhere in the vicinity when you need them the most.  If they are, they're more likely to ask for your help than give it

That goes without saying. However this can hardly be seen as some ""right wing conspiracy"" film when you consider that most of the people speaking directly in the film tend to run democrat to begin with. Obviously not Ann Coulter, but the rest for sure.

Forget the political arguments about liberal versus conservative or democrat versus republican for the moment and simply see it as an exposure of the man Moore himself as a master manipulator if nothing else.

Moore says ""there's no terrorist threat"" more than once in it which is just mind blowing. But anyway, since this film has been bashed to pieces by the brainwashed radical left, spend the $2 or less on it and watch it right after Fahrenheit 911.

That said, now to the matter of the film itself: If director Peterson wanted to market this solely to, say, the type of people who avoid mainstream media at all costs and rely strictly on alternate (i.e., *conservative*) news sources for information and current events, it would be easier to aceept the finished product. However, attempting to market this as a bipartisan response to Fahrenheit 9/11 only serves to damage this film's credibility even further, as one glance at the cast listing will tell you:

- Ron Silver (the narrator), a liberal-turned-conservative actor
- Dick Morris...while the pacakging touts him as a consultant to both Trent Lott and Bill Clinton, no mention is made of how he's since become an outspoken critic of the latter's wife, even joining the on-air staff of Fox News ('nuff said!)
- Ann ""I hate liberals"" Coulter...do you expect Democrats and the political left to get a fair shake from any work that includes her as a participant?
- Sen. Zell Miller, a glorified DINO (Democrat In Name Only)...even the packaging mentions his voting for Bush in 04 and being a keynote speaker at the same year's RNC
- Former NYC mayor Ed Koch, a conservative Dem...but regardless of his views, Peterson should've though twice about using him regardless, given the apparent senility he projects in his on-screen time

And what did the disabled solider from Farenheit expect when he gave that interview, regardless of its context? Moore was still free to use it as he pleased.

Liberal documenaries tend to be more biased. Conservative documenaries are not as biased because they use a lot of facts to back up their points.

I've debated many supporters of Michael Moore on the IMDb. Their arguement against people such as Michael Wilson, and Dick Morris is that Moore is just merely questioning the Bush administration and its policies. Moore is not just questioning the Bush administration. He wants to prove that President Bush is the worst president in our nation's history. Bush is not a perfect president, but he's not the criminal that Michael Moore portrays him as. But Moore wants Bush out of office. Political protest against the government for doing something wrong, is not unpatriotic, but using bent facts to slander or defame the government is. This is exactly what Michael Moore has done in Fahrenheit 9/11. I have exposed nine lies in Fahrenheit 9/11.

They include...

Fahrenheit Lie #1: National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice is depicted in the movie telling a reporter, ""Oh, indeed there is a tie between Iraq and what happened on 9/11.""

The scene deceptively shows the Administration directly blaming Saddam and his regime for the attacks on 9/11 by taking her comments out of context. Now read the entire statement made by Ms. Rice to the reporter: ""Oh, indeed there is a tie between Iraq and what happened on 9/11. It's not that Saddam Hussein was somehow himself and his regime involved in 9/11. But if you think about what caused 9/11, it is the rise of ideologies of hatred that led people to drive airplanes into buildings in New York.""

Fahrenheit Lie #2: In the film, Moore leads viewers to believe that members of bin Laden's family were allowed to exit the country after the attacks without questioning by authorities.

The September 11th commission, on the other hand, reported that 22 of the 26 people on the flight that took most of the bin Laden family out of the country were interviewed and found to be innocent of suspicion. The commission reported that ""each of the flights we have studied was investigated by the FBI and dealt with in a professional manner prior to its departure.""

Fahrenheit Lie #3: Moore claims that James Bath, a friend of President Bush from his time with the Texas Air National Guard, might have funneled bin Laden money to an unsuccessful Bush oil-drilling firm called Arbusto Energy.

Bill Allison, managing editor for the Center for Public Integrity (an independent watchdog group in Washington, D.C.), on the other hand, said, ""We looked into bin Laden money going to Arbusto, and we never found anything to back that up,"" (Source: Seattle Times, 7/5/04).

Fahrenheit Lie #4: The movie claims that the Bush administration ""supported closing veterans hospitals.""

""The Department of Veterans Affairs did propose closing seven hospitals in areas with declining populations where the hospitals were underutilized, and whose veterans could be served by other hospitals"" (Source: Kopel, Independence Institute). But Moore's film fails to mention that the Department also proposed building new hospitals in areas where needs were growing, and also proposed building blind rehabilitation centers and spinal cord injury centers (Source: Department of Veterans Affairs).

Fahrenheit #5: Conspiracy theories abound about the reasons for the War on Terror, but none is more outlandish than the one propagandized in Moore's film: that the Afghan war was fought solely to enable the Unocal company to build an oil pipeline (the plan for which was abandoned by the company in 1998).

Moore ""suggests that one of the first official acts of Afghan President Hamid Karzai ... was to help seal a deal for ... Unocal to build an oil pipeline from the Caspian Sea through Afghanistan to the Indian Ocean. It alleges that Karzai had been a Unocal consultant,"" (emphasis added), (Source: Seattle Times, 7/5/04). Unocal spokesman, Barry Lane, says unequivocally, ""Karzai was never, in any capacity, an employee, consultant or a consultant of a consultant,"" and Unocal never had a plan to build a Caspian Sea pipeline.

Moore mentions that the Taliban visited Texas while President Bush was governor to discuss a potential project with Unocal. While Moore implies that then-Governor Bush met with the Taliban, no such meeting occurred. The Taliban delegation did, however, meet with the Clinton Administration on this visit (Source: Weekly Standard).

Fahrenheit Lie #6: Even readily available figures are exaggerated for effect in Fahrenheit 9/11. The claims have a basis in reality, making them believable, but are false nonetheless.

In the film, Moore asks Craig Unger, author of House of Bush, House of Saud, ""How much money do the Saudis have invested in America, roughly?"" to which Unger responds, ""Uh, I've heard figures as high as $860 billion.""

The Institute for Research: Middle Eastern Policy reports that worldwide Saudi investment approximated $700 billion - a figure much lower than Unger alleges the Saudi government to have invested in the U.S. The Institute reports that 60 percent of that $700 billion - roughly $420 billion, less than half of what Unger ""heard"" - was actually invested in the United States by the Saudi government.

Fahrenheit Lie #7: ""Moore's film suggests that [President] Bush has close family ties to the bin Laden family - principally through [President] Bush's father's relationship with the Carlyle Group, a private investment firm. The president's father, George H.W. Bush, was a senior adviser to the Carlyle Group's Asian affiliate until recently; members of the bin Laden family - who own one of Saudi Arabia's biggest construction firms - had invested $2 million in a Carlyle Group fund.

Bush Sr. and the bin Ladens have since severed ties with the Carlyle Group, which in any case has a bipartisan roster of partners, including Bill Clinton's former SEC chairman Arthur Levitt. The movie quotes author Dan Briody claiming that the Carlyle Group 'gained' from September 11 because it owned United Defense, a military contractor. Carlyle Group spokesman Chris Ullman notes that United Defense holds a special distinction among U.S. defense contractors that is not mentioned in Moore's movie: the firm's $11 billion Crusader artillery rocket system developed for the U.S. Army is one of the only weapons systems canceled by the Bush administration."" (Source: Kopel, Independence Institute.)"" There is another famous investor in Carlyle whom Moore does not reveal: George Soros. But the fact that the anti-Bush billionaire [Soros] has invested in Carlyle would detract from Moore's simplistic conspiracy theory."" (Source: Kopel, Independence Institute.)

Fahrenheit Lie #8: Not revealing relevant facts is dishonest enough. But to paint the Bush Administration as sympathetic and friendly to the Taliban prior to September 11, is not only dishonest, but maliciously so.

Moore shows film of a March 2001 visit to the United States by a Taliban delegation, claiming that the Administration ""welcomed"" the Taliban official, Sayed Hashemi, ""to tour the United States to help improve the image of the Taliban."" But the Administration did not welcome the Taliban with open arms. In fact, the State Department rejected the Taliban's claim that it had complied with U.S. requests to isolate bin Laden. To demonstrate even further the Administration's contempt for the Taliban and its illegitimacy, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher - on the day of the terrorist regime's visit - said, ""We don't recognize any government in Afghanistan.""

Fahrenheit Lie #9: Moore does more than simply downplay the threat posed to the U.S. by the former Hussein regime in Iraq. He goes so far as to assert that Saddam ""never threatened to attack the United States.""

If by ""attack the United States"" one interprets this claim to mean that Saddam never threatened to send troops to the United States, then Mr. Moore has a point. But Saddam Hussein clearly sought to attack the United States within his own sphere of influence, even though he didn't have the resources to attack U.S. soil from his side of the world: On November 15, 1997, ""the main propaganda organ for the Saddam regime, the newspaper Babel (which was run by Saddam Hussein's son Uday), ordered: 'American and British interests, embassies, and naval ships in the Arab region should be the targets of military operations and commando attacks by Arab political forces.'"" (Source: Kopel, Independence Institute.) In addition, ""Iraqi forces fired, every day, for 10 years, on the aircraft that patrolled the no-fly zones and staved off further genocide in the north and south of the country,"" (Source: New York Times, 12/1/03). Saddam Hussein also provided safe haven to terrorists who killed Americans, like Abu Nidal; funded suicide bombers in Israel who certainly killed Americans; and ran the Iraqi police, which plotted to assassinate former President George Bush.

2156419,1,B00049QLWS,"Poorest excuse for a rebuttal I have EVER seen - though I have to say it takes a lot of guts to defend the Patriot Act, a hefty tome of legislation that Moore rightly pointed out no one read before they voted on it. Fahrenhype does not address that salient fact - that our congress is so inept that legislation gets passed the day after it comes off the press without so much as a glance. Or as Homer Simpson once said, ""Wait a minute, I don't sign anything until someone gives me the gist of it.""

Moore pointed out that only one member of congress has their son in the military in Iraq - no rebuttal - lame, lame, lame. Also no rebuttal to the salient fact that the poor are in the military in much greater numbers than the rich.

I wish the makers of this piece of dreck would sign up at their local recruiter and take Hannity and Limbaugh with them - and for you Limbaugh fans, did you know that Mr. Big Mouth attends Bilderberg meetings with the blessing of his friend and confidant David Rockefeller? Means nothing? Look up Bilderberg and then get back to me. Rush and Hannity and all the other loud mouth flag waving chicken hawks are Judas goats financed by the global elite to urge you to send your son or daughter off to fight for oil. Oh, by the way, the fact that the acting Presdent of Afghanistan was an adviser to UNOCAL gets no rebuttal in this movie either.

Moore pointed out that Bush continued to sit staring into space at the mention of the 9/11 attacks - Fahrenhype actually defends this, saying his aides were telling him to sit still. Who the hell is running this country anyway? Even Ann Coulter defends this stupidity - ""What was he supposed to do? Run out the door and shout Let me take the first bullet!"" Well, Ms. Coulter, no. But what could have been a photo op to show that he was a ""man of action"" basically made Bush look like an inept fool.

I was expecting a point by point rebuttal of Fahrenheit 911 and all I got was a bunch of lame-a** republican opinion pieces.

""The war was wrong""

Did the United States tell Saddam Hussein to disarm? Yes Did Saddam disarm? No. What about the chemical weapons Saddam used on his own people? Were those weapons of mass destruction? Yes. How about the SCUD missiles he launched against Israel during the Gulf War or Kuwait during the recent Iraq War? And how about that fact that some weapons were found, while you liberals are in total denial.

""The Iraqi people never threatened my people outside of their own country, Osama is our enemy""

And notice how you never talked about the plot to assasinate George H.W Bush in Kuwait in 1993. And why is Al Qaeda trying to get Saddam back in power? Shortly before the Iraq War began, Ted Kennedy (one's of the most liberal members of the Senate) clearly stated that Iraq had ties to Al Qaeda. Clinton was notified of this too. Bush shouldn't be the only one taking responsibility.

2156421,1,B00049QLWS,"I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 and now Fahrenhype 9/11. It is very hard to say which movie has more propaganda. Fahrenhype 9/11 critizes Michael Moore's movie, but it is not more objective than the other one. It uses the same techniques. The director tried to be funny as Michael Moore did with irony. The so called reliable interviewees are mostly republicans or people who endorses their politics:

- Zell Miller was Democratic Senator, but now fan of the republicans

- Ed Koch was Democrat, but now more republican

- Ann Coulter, a republican

- Steven Emerson, very disputed because of many errors in his books

- Dick Morris, backer of the republicans and disputed because of his scandal with a prostitute named Sherry Rowlands

- Peter King, republican

- Ron Silver, backer of Bush's politics

There are some inconsistencies like the involvements of Germans and Frenchs in the question of Iraq War. The author said the purpose of Bush's government in Iraq is not oil, but he indirectly said the purpose of the declination from the Germans and Frenchs did. Is this propaganda?

In sum, Republicans will like the movie. Democrats will say ""what a boring and stupid movie""",1131840000,23,1169,4.863636363636363

2156425,4,B00049QLWS,"First, all the disclaimers.  I watched Moore's film two days ago, and ultimately gave three stars for providing a decent, emotionally compelling, yet often uneven piece of propaganda.  I also voted for Bush, and have been hopeful, yet ambivalent about the war in Iraq.

As a film, Fahrenhype 9/11 is similar in quality to Moore's offering, yet more straightforward and dignified in approach.  While Moore often comes across as peevish and disdainful, the many speakers here communicate mostly dismay and wonder, as if to say, ""We know you do not like Bush, but why would you ridicule your own country and military before the world?""  Additionally, the tone of this film is almost like an extended newsmagazine doing an investigation--an appropriate response to Moore's sarcastic anti-Bush commercial.

As for the debate, Fahrenhype is a clear winner over Farhrenheit on the following counts:

1.  Effectively disputes some of Moore's rather sensational conspiracy theories:  That Bush's politically connected friends stole the election for him, that there is a sinister Bush/Saudi connection, and that the real reason for this war is to enrich the President's oil buddies.

2.  Effectively proves that some of Moore's evidence is misleading, that some was even doctored, and that he callously used out-of-context clips from people who in actuality oppose his views.

3.  Ultimately, Fahrenhype 9/11 proves that Moore did not convincingly prove his case.  In classic debate, those who argue for change have the burden of proof, and Moore collapses under this load!

Bottom-line:  Fahrenhype 9/11 bests the movie it critiques, but loses a point for its failure to reach a broad audience, and to escape the handicap that it is also a Republican propaganda production.  Bush won the election, so Mission Accomplished.  However, both of these films will garner amens from partisans, but may not draw much attention from the ambivalent majority in this country who are wary of a war drawn long, yet not convinced that there is a better alternative to staying the course.",1126656000,31,2064,5.203030303030303

2156429,4,B00049QLWS,"While watching this ""response"" to Michael Moore's documentary I found myself yelling at the TV screen. So I have to give the film some credit for striking a nerve (several, actually). I did appreciate the film pointing out several areas where Michael Moore either twisted facts to paint a convenient picture from time to time but some of the critique's of Moore's film fail to actually address their beefs with the picture. For instance, the only response we get to the sudden departure of Saudi Arabian royals after 9/11 was Ron Silver stating something to the effect that if he were a Saudi, he'd flee the country, too. I wondered, why? If American is not as bad as Michael Moore supposedly says it is, then why should Saudi Arabian's flee the country if they had nothing to do with the attacks???? There were plenty of Saudi Arabian and Muslim people who didn't flee the country after 9/11 - and some of them were beaten and harassed as a result...by so called patriotic Americans. Hell, we even passed legislation to make sure their (and our own) civil liberties were undermined. I particularly enjoyed Dick Morris's little rant about how great the Patriot Act is.

I also enjoyed how this documentary attempted to debunk the President's reaction to the attacks while he was at the Elementary School. Ann Coulter states ""I want to ask liberals what did you expect him to do?"". I'll tell you - I heard about the attacks through a phone call from my manager who was in Phoenix (I was in Philadelphia). I immediately called my wife at home and told her to turn on the news. I then told my coworkers and we all immediately tuned in our radios to get information. We then tried getting in touch with our office managers who were in a conference room to tell them what happened. By the time the third plan hit the Pentagon we all pretty much assumed the U.S. was under attack. Since we work in a high rise building in center city Philadelphia, we decided we might be in danger so we took it upon ourselves to get out of the building. From the moment we heard the news of the attacks, we mobilized, gathered as much information as we could, and made a decision to do something. We sure as hell didn't sit around for 5 minutes, 7 minutes or 8 minutes.

Sure, the President unified the country for a brief moment in time after the attacks but he soon divided it with curious actions like invading a nation that the Right still refuses to admit HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH 9/11!!!!!!

Finally, whether Michael Moore used footage of an injured soldier and a military funeral without permission is a valid criticsm; however, why must the Right use the sacrifice of our servicemen and women in order to intimidate critics into silence? Because Farenheit 9/11 criticizes the current administration does not mean Michael Moore hates those who serve our country (nor does it mean he hates America). It is true horror that our military people have been trained to take it personally when anyone criticizes their leadership. Because if those who fight for our country can not be critical of the actions our nation takes, then our very liberties are at risk from within. We don't need terrorism to bring us down.",1118707200,16,3192,4.62610229276896
2156430,2,B00049QLWS,"I watched ""Fahrenhype 9/11"" because a friend of mine rented it who is so far-left he makes Michael Moore look like Rush Limbaugh. He rented it because he wanted to ""know thy enemy"" and it was in that spirit that I watched it as well.

There really isn't much here on the whole. I'll be polite and say that the Fox News Contributors and absolutely loony Zell Miller did little to sway me. But then they finally bring out the one big gun they possess: the ""phantom limb pain guy.""  They prove to my satisfaction that Michael Moore did a nauseatingly dishonest thing. There is something especially despicable about using a man who has sacrificed his limbs for his country in an anti-war film without his consent, a film that is apparently totally contrary to his own beliefs. Now, if memory serves, that clip was used as part of Moore's contention that the US military was not doing enough to help those with medical problems. I'm sure he could have found someone who would willingly attest to that fact, but no that person might not have missing limbs, and if film history has taught audiences one thing about the disability experience it is that nothin' says ""war is terrible"" like a severely disabled vet.

I would consider what Michael Moore did to be not only exploitive, but also to be akin to perjury, it casts doubt on everything else in the film.
  If the man told the makers of ""Fahrenhype"" the exact opposite of what Moore implied, it is safe to assume that Michael Moore must have had some inkling from the source footage that he harbored no ill feelings toward the military.

I used to be what Michael Moore calls a RINO- a Republican In Name Only. He convinced me that corporations get away with crimes the media will not cover, that healthcare should be universal, that most of us will never be rich so we should have no false allegiances to the wealthy in the hopes of someday joining them, and lastly despite his ill-timed and ultimately very disrespectful Oscar-speech, he helped me realize beyond all doubt that this war is unjust. Since I have now seen irrefutable proof that Michael Moore is not above doing incredibly dishonest things to get his point across, I now believe that those of us who support the supposedly ""far-Left"" causes I have listed deserve a better representative than Michael Moore.",1117324800,17,2320,4.6601466992665035

2156432,2,B00049QLWS,"OK.  The debunker is about to be debunked.

First, I'll mention what I believe are legitimate criticisms of Michael Moore's movie.  Though I generally agree with Moore and his message, there are occasions where he stretches a bit.  One of the most valid points made concerns the Oregon coast.  In Fahrenheit, Moore points to the one part-time trooper within 100 miles of coast, and makes it appear this man, singularily, is responsible for keeping boats of terrorists at bay.  State tax dollars do not go to border patrol; this is something that federal agencies specialize in; federal police and the Coast Guard.

Personally though, I think Moore included that scene, more than anything, as an excuse to give us yet another slice of small town rural Americana, like he does with Tappahannock VA, or in ""Roger & Me"" when he includes the totally extraneous scene of a woman building up an Amway buisness.  In this instance he couldn't resist the temptation to make a direct link between the lack of troopers and Bush's incompetence.

Another valid point, illustrated via FahrenHYPE's contributors, is that the US - Saudi relationship is a delicate, flawed relationship which stems all the way back to 1945, and that one can find ample pictures of every American president hamming it up with the Saudi elite.  This does illustrate one tenet of Moore's movie: it focuses so singularily on Bush's administration that the less-educated viewer might think ""Crap.  Our government had so much openness and integrity before the criminal regime of Bush Inc.""  In reality, Bush's policies, though more aggressive and transparent than his predecessors, are the culmination of fifty years of US imperialism.  This might take a slight amount of heat off Bush personally, but it doesn't excuse our government's imperialism.

(It is worthy to note, however, that in ""Bowling for Columbine,"" Moore does highlight the larger context of US foreign policy from 1945-present.)

OK, now to rebut the more ridiculous criticisms:

First, there's the ""mountain-out-of-molehill"" school of criticism of Moore's movie:

That in the Florida classroom, the children were reading to the president, not the other way round!  Second, the amount of time Bush was sitting there was actually five minutes, not seven!  Third, Porter Goss' phone number was not a 1800 number, but a 1-877 toll free number!

Needless to say, the above criticisms do not stand up affirmatively to the question ""Does this alter the validity of the message of Moore's film?""

Election 2000:  Shot of Katherine Harris declaring that Bush won.  Remember, Katherine Harris was the secretary of state, which also meant she was the Florida vote-counter for Bush.  FahrenHYPE completely avoids the Black voter disenfranchisement issue.  It does however focus on a shot of an editorial Moore used, from Bloomington Illinois' PANTAGRAPH paper.  Apparently, Moore blew up the headline and rearranged the paragraphs so that they would fit the movie screenshot.  The paper was offended and asked Moore for an apology, which he rightfully did not issue, as he did nothing wrong.

After 10 minutes of the FahrenHYPE's contributors reminiscing about the patriotism and heroism of the police and firefighters on 9/11, obviously included to put the viewer back into the immediate 9/11 aftermath mindset, political operative Dick Morris starts attacking Clinton for eight years of failure to stop 9/11.  No hard facts are presented that Clinton was asleep at the wheel; to the contrary, Clinton's team thwarted many domestic al-Qaeda attacks, most notably a Y2K (late 1999) plot to blow up Los Angeles international airport.  Why?  Because they took warnings seriously.  Clinton met with Richard Clarke for terrorism briefings every day.  Bush had a clear warning on August 6, 2001 and ignored it.  Of course, none of this is mentioned in FahrenHYPE.

Moving on to Afghanistan and the whole Unocal thing:  what Dick Morris and company are saying IS TRUE:  Unocal DID explore an Afghan pipeline deal during the Clinton period (when Dubya was governor) and the plan WAS dropped.  But they don't tell you the rest of it, because it proves Moore's point.  The REASON it was dropped was because Unocal couldn't negotiate with the Taliban.  Once the Taliban was out of power after 9/11, plans for the pipline could resume.

Well, this review is getting long, but to just rebut one more criticism in HYPE: Moore's ""emotional manipulation"" of his audience.  While it is true that Moore is a master of this, Fahrenheit justifies its use.  In HYPE, Hardy and Clarke (""Michael Moore is a Big Fat Stupid White Man"") use the exact example I knew they would:  Moore's footage of Iraqi children playing, followed by the US bombing of Baghdad.  Clarke says, ""Moore shows you children flying kites, then immediately cuts to the bombing, and the viewer associates the bomb damage with the children.  In actuality the bombs were directed at Saddam's military targets and bunker.""

This would be valid criticism were it not for two things:  First, there have, to date, been over 100,000 Iraqi civilian deaths.  Second, Moore immediately follows the bombing footage with footage of a pickup truck full of dead bodies, including at least one child!  Hardy/Clarke's point here is null and void, and clearly directed toward partisans who refuse to see Mr. Moore's movie.

Oh, and the amputee who's outraged over being included in Fahrenheit and disagrees with Moore's take on the war:  he's in denial.  He's lost his leg and can't accept the fact that the reason he went to war could be a lie.  In a few years, when the ugly truth hits him, he'll be bitter.

Finally, toward the end, the right-wing hate reaches its artful conclusion:  ""Michael Moore is un-American; he's not British... he must be French!""",1114905600,29,5806,5.060063224446786
2156433,5,B00049QLWS,"Most of the claims that Moore makes in Farenheit 911 are invalidated by this film by being revealed as devoid of context, but others are proved to be outright lies. After making it through Moores 2-hour gloomy, arrogant, and mostly fictional demonization of his own country, this is a breath of fresh air. If you were shocked and amazed by the picture of lacking moral values among the Bush administration painted by Moore, you'll be shocked once again after seeing this, this time by the factual fallacy of the cornerstones of Moores strongest points in Farenheit 911.

An additional bonus is seeing characters from Farenheit 911 appearing in Farenhype to reveal the circumstances of their appearances in Moores film. All were lied to by Moore and his affiliates, misrepresented, and taken out of context.

The fact that this film will never enjoy the media attention and retail distribution of its factually inferior counterpart is unfortunate, but is why I encourage anyone and everyone who's seen F911 to follow that viewing with this one.

2156434,3,B00049QLWS,"The good news is that this DVD does enable one to be more critical of Michael Moore's movie, ""Fahrenheit 911.""

The bad news is that this DVD is at least as deceptive as Moore's movie.  Even if leftist orthodoxy were not involved, this amalgam would be at no risk of getting any award at Cannes or anywhere else.  Honest conservatives will admit that this was an election campaign rush job and a Rush job.

I ordered the combination DVD and companion book.  I was disappointed even by the covers of each.  The book cover has a tasteless, juvenile cartoon beneath even ""T V Nation.""  The DVD package features incomplete biographical labels that will be used slyly in the actual film.  For example, Dick Morris was a consultant to and image guru for Bill Clinton, but before that he worked for multiple Republicans and after 1996 (he left the service of President Clinton over Mr. Morris's peccadillos, remember!) he became a conservative author, debunker, and contributor to and analyst at Fox News.  Identifying Morris as advisor to Clinton represents Morris as much as calling Ronald Reagan a New Dealer would.  Where's the rest of him?

One reads, for a second example, that Steven Emerson has uncovered many of the plots since 9/11, but one is not told that Mr. Emerson authoritatively attributed the Oklahoma City bombing to jihadists.  I don't blame the producers of this DVD for leaving out that juicy tidbit, but I do fault them for attacking Moore for similarly partial, partisan incompleteness.  Sauce for the goose, baby!  If you're going to attack Moore for being selective and deceptive (as you do and should), then you should redouble your efforts to be as forthcoming as you can.  Clever labels incline the skeptical, attentive viewer to ask who is more deceptive, Moore or you.

That the makers of this pastiche resort to such misleading tactics led me to conclude that, when they analyze propaganda and partisan bilge, they certainly know whereof they speak.  Who would cite Ann Coulter's views on any subject and expect to be taken seriously?  How dare the makers of this movie degrade serious thinkers and writers (such as conservative intellectual David Frum) by juxtaposing them with Zell Miller?  Who but an ideologue would regard Bill Sammon as adding credibility to the film from his perch at the Washington Times?

Inside both the companion monograph and the DVD, I encountered a decidedly desultory mix.  Excellent points (for example, that Moore was dead wrong about the pipeline through Afghanistan) lie cheek by jowl alongside vilifications of Moore, post-911 solidarity-speak, emotion-laden irrelevancies, and more digressions and irrelevancies than a book report recited by a third-grader who had not gotten around to reading the book.

(...)

Worse, those who assembled this extended campaign commercial imitated some of the very tactics for which they excoriate Moore.  How important is Moore's utterly decontextuallized statement ""There is no terrorist threat!"" to his film?  If one believes that Moore's personal beliefs are fair game (and I suppose they are, despite the fact that this is a textbook example of an ad hominem), then why isn't it as unfair to rip his statement from context as it was to parody President Bush's remarks out of the context in which and to which they pertained?

And if this or that person plunked into Moore's film disagrees with Moore's message or hates Moore, so what?  That Moore is at best a scamp and a blowhard and at worst a scalawag and a bloviator (thank you, Bill O'Reilly, for reviving Menckenesque adjectives!) is admitted even by the Left.  That those whom Moore selected to dramatize and to hype Moore's points disagree with his points seems to me inconsequent. Did Dick Morris and Ed Koch miss a certain polemmical edge to Moore's work over the last 15+ years?  Do they imagine that many on the Left actually resemble their or Ann Coulter's slanders?

In sum, this DVD, when viewed alongside Moore's DVD, might make for a fascinating study of how crass, childish name-calling supplanted intelligent debate in our times.  Neither DVD, when viewed alone, will adequately inform or enlighten.

The filmmakers have taken great pains to refute every single claim and ""fact"" presented by Moore, who looks like a true charlatan by the film's end.  The interviews, particularly Ed Koch and Zell Miller are very interesting, and Ron Silver is enthralling as the narrator.  the Film industry must do more to stop filmmakers, espcially those who claim to make documentaries, to hold to a higher standard of truth.

I saw this film and thought ""well it is clearly one sided but in some points it seemed true and the interviews seemed genuine"". But some things sounded fishy and down right propaganda. Then to be fair I saw the other view ""FahrenHYPE 9/11"",and my eyes were opened wide. the same people interviewed in Fahrenheit 9/11 were also in FahrenHYPE 9/11 saying how what they said was edited and manipulated, and all the Bush footage was shown uncut so you could see what was really said and manipulated in  Michael Moore's film. I have to tell you I have never seen a film so manipulating and full of lies like Moore's film. I felt insulted and mislead. I then decided to check all the facts myself and after a deep and long finding of facts it was clear. Michael Moore's film Fahrenheit 9/11 was full of lies and manipulated facts wile ""FahrenHYPE 9/11"" was 100% true. Look I am a left wing tree hugger but the truth is the truth and Moore's film is a lie. If you want the truth I suggest you watch ""FahrenHYPE 9/11"", and then check for your self.

2156442,1,B00049QLWS,"I tired to see this movie to get ""the other side of the coin"" from a totally biased movie, which was Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911, and of course, he is trying to make a point. First of all, this has a very right-winged feeling. They are portraying a president that I really don't know why they don't add a halo in it already. Second, the so-called ""experts"" just blunt explanations like when people don't want to admit guilt and just say whatever to defend themselves. One example was Michael Moore's allegation of Bush's connection with the BinLaden family. Well, these guys counterattacked by saying ""well, then you have a bigger problem because so and so from the Clinton cabinet belongs to that group too."" does this mean Moore is lying? I don't think so. Yet, for some reason, this movie is too concerned in calling Moore a liar without much basis.  They never gave an intelligent explanation on the Bin Laden connection and why Osama Bin Laden is still at large if he was and *IS* the real threat considering 911.

The only honesty I seemed to grasp from the movie was from the soldiers, their families, and the actor that assimilated the atrocities of Sadam Hussein (if we don't stop him in time, what would it lead to?) with those of Adolf Hitler. I can see their point of view and can sympathize. From the people Moore interviewed, I can see the point this movie makes about the Oregon state trooper. It's true; lack of funding is really the state's problem, not federal. The other soldier that felt ""violated"" though, he even mentioned that the footage was from another interview, well then, who isn't going to use public footage for their use? I really feel bad for him, and I guess when something like that happens to the soldiers or there is a loss of a loved one in war, we are going to blame someone, some people blame the elite people making the decisions of going to war and their reasons, others will blame the people who are protesting against these people and their reasons like Michael Moore. That is sadly the way it is. However, I didn't feel Moore mocked the soldiers; he just presented footage, some of it was raw and unpleasing, some of it was honoring and presenting the feelings of the soldiers. And the footage from the soldiers, I thought, they are human, they believe they are going to fight the enemy ""evil"" otherwise they wouldn't be there. Also, if Moore is a lying bstrd, then why not add an interview of the most compelling lady from the movie, the one that was very patriotic and then lost her son? Is this a fake too? It didn't seem to me.

Questions that make one wonder.... what happened to the orange level threat during the elections? Instead of spending so much for his election, shouldn't Bush have focused on something else, like, Osama Bin Laden or the problem in Iraq with increasing numbers of soldiers (more than 1000) dying not to mention about 100,000 Iraquis dead? And if Iraq was a very real threat, wasn't it too North Korea? Heck they really have not disarmed. Or better yet, why not bomb half the globe! Who isn't a threat nowadays? Or maybe, that is exactly what our good president and his administration are thinking of already....(history to be continued). Oh, and don't expect to hear any of these questions explored by this lame documentary.

I would have applauded this movie if they would have shown the unbiased truth on Moore, and on Bush (good, bad and ugly on both), but no success. And even though Moore is totally biased on his attacks for Bush (please note, Bush, NOT THE MILITARY as they say in this movie) I enjoyed Moore's film much better than this one.

2156447,1,B00049QLWS,"This could've been such a better film. Dick Morris makes the profound insight that Al Gore's name is similar to the word ""algorithm"";  Ann Coulter says the word ""Kurd""--a word she claims liberals never use; thus, proving once and for all she's a conservative; Kopel mentions one or two of his 59 Deceits (I guess they didn't have time for the rest), Zell Miller states that public nuisances are like copperheads who ought to be smashed;  Ed Koch claims that most of those who oppose the patriot act don't know what it says (neglecting the fact that those who oppose it actually do so for what it DOESN'T say [like define ""terrorist""]), and actor Ron Silver gives several soliloquies that demonstrate how best to act like someone with a chip on his shoulder (or is that a log in the eye?).

As for the negative side, they mainly have to do with mis-truths (naw, you say?): but HYPE actually out-does Fahrenheit in HYPE when somebody claims: ""What's not being shown on TV, and what you'll never come and understand is a group of children flying a kite. Under the Taliban that would probably be their death."" The speaker here is referring to Moore's depiction of life before the Iraqi invasion, including a scene where children are shown flying a kite. The speaker, however, goes at length to mix up the conflict in Iraq with the one in Afghanistan. Actually, if you listen to what's implied by quite a few of the speeches here, you'll find a lot of the tirades guilty of this.

Much of HYPE accentuates the trivial (e.g., Democrats also invested in Carlyle [this doesn't exclude the fact that Bush Sr. was once one of its senior advisors]; also complaining that Moore used footage in the public record without the participant's permission ... it happens, it's public!). It's efficient, though, in the manner it expands on a half-truth, e.g., failing to mention that the proof of al-queda's involvement with the USS Cole bombing didn't materialize until May 2001 (i.e, Bush's watch, and as Ann Coulter would say, he did nothing). FahrenHYPE (and HYPE it is) also goes so far as to claim that Moore's film is unpatriotic and, beyond that, aids terrorists. But I don't mind HEIT being seen outside of the U.S. since the film patriotically shows that dissent is acceptable in the U.S.. Bush isn't ""America"", after all. He's a hired hand whose office has to adhere to the checks and balances our nation's founders assigned to it.

Overall, the quality of the arguments here are like the one specified on the DVD's back cover: ""Is Michael Moore out for the truth, or is he out to get rich?"" This is a bad argument of giving a choice between only two options while more are likely (i.e., a false dichotomy). In this case, it excludes the film's real intention: to discredit Bush. FAHRENHYPE, similarly, has the agenda of discrediting Moore. So, what you get in both films is a series of half truths along with some misinformation (but HYPE lacks the humor, and has the burden of proof). In general,  HYPE probably deserves 2 stars for being standard fare, but I demoted it one because it attempts to do (as does Kopel's ""59 Deceits"") what ought to be impossible: to succeed at the very thing it condemns (HYPE!).",1106179200,28,3203,4.690391459074733

2156449,4,B00049QLWS,"While one can't address all of Moore's lies and distortions in a single film (unless it is the length of the full-length version of Shogun), this one does a good job of discrediting some of the most damning accusations made by Moore.

Moore's implication that Bush spirited the bin Laden family out of country while the nation's airspace was closed is discredited by the 9/11 Commission.

People that Moore used in his docuganda came out against him.  An Oregon state trooper, who was included in the docuganda, told the truth in this video.  Moore claimed that Bush budget cuts to Oregon State troopers were the reason that the Oregon coast was undefended.  Fact:  The federal government doesn't fund the Oregon State Police, state funds do.  Fact:  The Oregon State Police's job is NOT to defend the coast, that is the job of the U.S. Coast Guard.  A soldier who was decapitated also voiced his displeasure at his inclusion in the docuganda and set the record straight (while wearing the cap of the greatest baseball team on the planet.)

This video, while not flashy like Moore's docuganda, has the virtue of being true.

There is little left of Michael Moore except a grotesque, grizzled carcass by the time FahrenHYPE 9/11 ends.

The film is composed of a considerable amount of interviews with well-known public figures, but some of the interview subjects are rare and valuable. The teacher whose classroom George W. Bush attended during the morning of 9/11 is heard from and it's quite a journalistic ""get"". She comments that, although she did not vote for him, she regarded him as acting appropriately and Presidential on that day. This is just one of the many ways in which the film refutes Moore's assertions in Fahrenheit 911. Ed Koch is an exceptional commentator and points out that, although he voted for Gore in 2000, Bush's leadership has won him over in the years since. Zell Miller and Dick Morris lend further gravitas to the production and Ron Silver is excellent as well.

The response to Moore is detailed and large in scale. We find that his statistic about Bush's vacation time before 9/11 was inaccurate, and that his footage of Bush at the 2000 Al Smith dinner was misleading due to its leaving out Al Gore's attendance, and that Fahrenheit 9/11's link of Bush to the Carlyle Group and Bin Laden is entirely fictional. In fact, the Carlyle Group is more closely affiliated to George ""Moveon.org"" Soros than to George Herbert Walker Bush. Particularly surprising was the interview with the poor Oregon State trooper who Moore manipulated via inclusion in his film. It seems that the trooper never met Moore at all but thought he was doing a local documentary. A great point, consistently presented by the interviewees is that Islamofascism is the biggest threat to US security today.

I could not agree more even though Fahrenheit 9/11 slanderously claimed that it is not a threat to America at all. Michael Moore is a pathological liar and we should all be glad FahrenHYPE 9/11 was created.",1105833600,55,2060,4.863247863247863

The film has some good interviews, strong statements from both the Left and Right and, most importantly, interviews with people that were featured in ""Farenheit"" who disagree completely with Mr. Moore.  I think that this film was more of a pure documentary than Moore's film, which I consider to be propaganda.  However I do think that the film failed to do one important thing: explain to the viewer how Moore's film was full of fabrications and crafty editing.

Yes, all the major lies and manipulations were pointed out.  But, unless you had just finished watching Moore's film, it can be hard to remember everything being referred to from ""Farenheit"".  I imagine that Michael Moore fans and most people on the Left will not be affected by this film, which I consider to be a major failure on the part of the film maker.  Michael Moore is hardly in the film and scenes from ""Farenheit 9/11"" are very scarse.  It would be more effective if scenes were shown - immediately followed by a presentation of the actual facts.  Much of the time, people being interviewed just talked about it.  Visuals would have been much more effective.

I recommend this documentary to anyone who loves Michael Moore and hates president Bush.  This film will, at the very least, offer a new way of looking at Michael Moore and provide an opportunity to see him as the manipulator of facts that he actually is.

I'm not sure if Fahrenheit 911 was directed by Moore, I mean, the movie is credited as his, but Hype just pointed out that every bit of information Moore used was wrong or made up. IN Heit bush sits for 7 minutes in a classroom and wtc is attacked. In a clear attempt to prove Michael Moore a total liar, Bush only sat for 5 minutes(according to Hype), what difference did it make 5 or 7, they claim he was collecting his thoughts for 5 minutes. Look at his eyes, He looks like he is working on a coverup or purposely placing himself in a situation in which he will too occupied to do anything, making him look like a wise hero. A savior if you will. Personally after seeing him in the debates with Kerry, I realize nothing is going on up stairs. So for five minutes he was probably sounding out the letters to read the cover of my pet goat. In the original commercial for MICHAEL MOORE HATES AMERICA.

2156462,1,B00049QLWS,"This movie is widly, clumsily dishonest, but it's also just a terrible, amateurish, boring movie. The bulk of the movie's time is spent exaggerating and distorting stuff from Michael Moore's film, then refuting these things that were never said or represented in Moore's film. I guess it's easier to refute things that were never actualy said to begin with. One of the film's central witnesses is Dick Morris, a former liberal hack who was kicked out of liberal elite circles (over both personal scandal and because he's a loose cannon) and who has glommed onto Fox News and the right wingers now. The only people interviewed here are fierce Bush defenders, which might be okay if the movie wasn't pretending to be truthful and ""fair and balanced."" This movie is full of nothing other than mindless, shallow declarations about terrorism, revenge, and fake patriotism. Sadly, the reviews posted here continue the same angry name-calling and screeds that liberals hate America -- how shameful and depressing for our country.  There's no harm in seeing this thing (other than the fact that it will bore you to death), but it's rarely informative, never balanced, and somehow determined to ignore any truth if it contradicts right wing political dogma. What a shame. Imagine how powerful it could have been if it HAD honestly, intelligently refuted information from Moore's film. Luckily, very few people are seeing this thing. I was curious, and now that curiosity has been satisfied.",1104105600,24,1481,5.069672131147541

Moore presents his case, the only way to get an alternate opinion is to view a movie such as this, which not only presents a counterpoint to Moore's arguement, but also talks to the very same people that Moore claims to have interviewed for his movie.  The best part, for me, is that FahrenHYPE 9/11 doesn't even go in to the manipulative movie-making tactics that Moore employes to fool the audience, it simply lays out the statements given by the people in Moore's movie and let's the viewer decide.

It exposes the information (or misinformation) introduced by Fahrenheit 9/11 as a combination of blatant lies and deliberately misleading half-truths. Regardless of one's political affiliations and views on American foreign policy, it is important to see this film so as to be appraised of reality. Some of Fahrenhype 9/11 contains editorial commentary on American foreign policy in Iraq which not all people would agree with, but irrespective of this, the film exposes the truth about the real threat of Islamic fascism and Michael Moore's anti-American propaganda, of which all people should be aware. Incidentally if Michael Moore thinks he can tap into anti-American sentiment in Australia by presenting lies, he is in fact achieving an effect opposite to that which he intended - he certainly failed to achieve his goal with me and a number of my Aussie friends, who do not appreciate being lied to, regardless of their politics.",1103328000,8,1037,5.290909090909091
2156467,5,B00049QLWS,"This movie shows what really the facts are, half of them left out in Moore's movie. Most interesting is Dick Morris who was working with the Clinton administration. As he puts it: If Bush was to be blamed for 8 months into the office, when 9/11 happened, Clinton should have been blamed for 8 years. Under the Clinton administration, 8 of the 9/11 terrorist were identified as suspects; officials working for Clinton asked him to go after them, but Clinton only accepted a solution to make sure whenever the ""suspects"" travel, their luggage travel along with them (because that's what brought down PanAm 103 back in the 80s).

It is also very interesting to see people who were in Fahrenheit 9/11 critisizing Moore not showing what they were really saying, i.e. Moore edited their interviews to present his own view. The victims feel betrayed by Moore, and as one person puts its, Moore is nothing but just an ""Ambulance Chaser"".",1103155200,18,929,4.80625

Those who have not even taken the time to view Fahrenheit 9/11 have no rights to comment upon it.

It argues that Moore's film takes great liberty with truth or otherwise, completely mistates the truth. Regardless of your belief, the movie certainly counters the most significant points of Moore's film. In the end, i concluded that Moore's film is a well crafted hit piece on Bush and this is a decent(but could be better) reply.

2156475,5,B00049QLWS,"His hair was meticulously combed, his face was clean shaven and he wore a well tailored suit and tie. Yep-I'm describing Michael Moore's appearance as a guest on the Jay Leno Show on November 30th. Equally stunning was the dignity with which he spoke. Moore acknowledged that President Bush was re-elected because the President received the most votes, calling it, correctly, the will of the majority. WOW!!! First Bill Mahr publicly, graciously accepted defeat of his chosen candidate, and now Michael Moore publicly accepted defeat with a goodly amount of dignity. (Good. No one likes a sore loser---nor a boastful winner, either).

There are two sides to every story because interpretation is an art not a science. I like investigative journalism. It's good to publicly confront people, businesses, and even governments and other entities. I dislike spin. Again-interpretation is an art not a science. But what I absolutly hate is deceit, and Moore stooped to deceit and falsehoods in his film. FahrenHYPE 9/11 was not perfect but it was an excellent counterpoint to Moore's film, and I highly recommend viewing it IF you have already seen Fahrenheit 9/11. If you haven't, then it is not crutial to do so.

If Moore hadn't strayed so far off the path of truth and wisdom with his Fahrenheit 9/11 there would have not been a NEED for  FahrenHYPE 9/11, and I do believe that FahrenHYPE 9/11 would not have been made if this true NEED didn't arise.

One telling moment for me was when Moore told Leno that he made the film as a DOCUMENTARY but that he had to re-classify it as a DRAMA when he wanted to air it on network TV. (Yeah, because a documentary must be able to prove it's facts and a drama isn't bound  by that rule).",1102032000,17,1726,4.74
2156476,4,B00049QLWS,"OK, so the movie was not perfect.  I would not have repeated all of the ""bashing"" of Micheal Moore to some of my more liberal friends... but I still enjoyed the film.  I knew exactly what I was going to watch when I sat down.  I didn't mean to pick out another Micheal Moore film and ""oops"" what was this; a left winged conservative film?!!!  Seriously, I am sorry some of you watched this movie just so you could write a nasty comment.

I found this film to be very entertaining. The bashing of Mr. Moore seemed fair considering the ""evidence"" he presented in his film.  (So, no issue there.) I LIKED the fact that the movie used many right winged members to fuel their points.  But, what I enjoyed the most from FahrenHYPE 9/11 were the interviews with the SAME people from both movies.  How on EARTH can you argue with that?  Just like in several scenes, the picture flashed from color to black and white... maybe the truth can be that simple, as well. It has been said a million times before, but the truth CAN be as simple as black and white.

All I have to say about those that disagreed with Ed Koch: that's fine.  There were some statements that were below the belt, but others you just can't deny.  To those who have not seem either movie... watch Moore's film first and then at least watch the HYPE to help filter out what was a lie.",1101859200,23,1343,4.306772908366534
2156477,2,B00049QLWS,"I lean slightly to the left, but I like to be open minded so I thought I'd see this film.

The film basically tries to do a point/counter-point argument against some of Moore's opinions in F9/11. The most powerful and effective are new interviews of a few people who were in Moore's film who thought they were not represented fairly. How well you think the rest of the film was made will depend on your bias.

I agree that the film relied too much on right-wing ""experts"" to counter Moore. For instance, a good piece of the film relies on the two men who wrote the book ""Michael Moore is a Big Fat Stupid White Man,"" whom clearly have a bias. The men seem more concerned with smearing Moore's image than corrected inaccuracies of information. It's pretty much epitomized when the fat bald guy says something to the effect of ""Moore is unAmerican, he's not Canadian, he must be French."" Then his little friend snickers like a weasel. A public service announcement of Project VoteSmart this is not. Was I really expected to believe these guys over Moore?

One of the most memorable parts of Moore's film was the sequence that showed Bush in the classroom after being told, ""America is under attack."" Fahrenhype basically argued that Bush didn't want to alarm the American public by making any sudden moves. First of all, who was watching Bush live in the classroom? Nobody. Everyone I know was glued to news channels like CNN watching live footage of NYC. Was it even being broadcasted live? Wasn't it just for publicity?  Second, it doesn't explain the scared and lost look on his face which left such a strong impression on myself. They are sure to make clear that Bush actually did nothing for 5 minutes, not 7.

I was annoyed by Fahrenhype's constant attempts to make the viewer think Bill Clinton was at the root of all conspiracies--clearly a Republican bias.

It gives a typical Republican argument for supporting the Iraq war, which we've all heard a thousand times, so it is unlikely to change any opinions. Nothing new or stimulating is presented, just interviews of a few soldiers who were clearly conservative.

Often Fahrenhype would state a damning ""fact,"" yet not give any hints at the source of the information. This is absolutely crucial! I guess the film expects you to believe it to be a reliable source of information--more reliable than Moore's film.

Finally, I noticed there was a lot of zooming in and out on interviewee's faces, as well as switching back and forth from color to B&W, which made me wonder if they had done a lot of editing and were trying to hide the copy-and-pasting of words and sentences.

If you don't know where you stand on the political compass see both films. If you prefer Moore's then you're probably a liberal, if you prefer this one then you're probably a conservative.
