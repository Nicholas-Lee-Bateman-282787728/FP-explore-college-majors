1987298,4,B0001CNRS4,"I was told, many years ago, that if one did not have anything nice to say, one should say nothing at all.  Can anyone imagine that rule being followed on Amazon?  The board would be empty, pretty much.  The problems with ""honey"" stick out like very sore thumbs, one can see every blemish during the previews, even on the poster.  It seems the pretty young idealist from New York, I think it's New York, the film credits say Canada, a really urban Canada perhaps, teaches hip hop at ""The Center"", you know, one of those lovable, grimy city dwellings that cater to talented, racially diverse groups of young people who just gotta dance.  Good thing too, because if ya don't dance in ""The hood"" ya gonna get ""dusted"" or Smoked"" or whatever.  There is only one way out kids, sing, dance and dance some more, if you are very lucky the local idealist hottie will be teaching the ""Moves"".  The hottie in question is, debatably, the hottest hottie in all of Hottietown ( I don't know if this is Hottietown USA or Canada, it really doesn't matter).  Jessica Alba is best known as the Sci Fi Hottie on ""Dark Angel"", I never saw the show, but I certainly saw Ms. Alba in the magazine ads and the ""Got Milk"" ads.  Damn she's hot.  Really hot.  But this is the movies and so on we go with the endless roll call of Hollywood clich&eacute;s, got a paper and pencil?, let's have the roll call.
1.  Drop dead beautiful idealistic young hottie (I know that's redundant and I don't care)
2.  Group of adorable scamps who are going to wind up in jail or the NBA of they don't get there big break dancing, singing, whatever.
3.  Evil rich guy who wants to A.  Tear down the beloved building where the crucial practice take place.  B, seduce and destroy innocent hottie for his own nefarious purposes.  C.  Seduce and destroy adorable scamps recruiting them to a life of crime and bad dance numbers.
4.  Colorful local characters with hearts of gold, sassy girlfriends, lovable barber and numerous characters recycled from ""The Jefferson's"" and ""That's My Mamma"" (yes I am that old, and who asked you anyway?)
5.  Cliffhanger scenario where all will be lost if some large amounts of money are not raised just in time.
6.  And of course the evil ""other dancer"" who seems ready to take Honey's spot when Honey refuses to do the casting couch hustle with the evil rich guy.
They used every toy in the box.  Albas mother, a retired hottie, has noble ideas for her daughter, but is clueless as can be, at one point she actually says ""You are 22 years old...you don't know what you want"", to there credit, no one in the cast burst out laughing, the same cannot be said for the audience.  As the time is running out and the noble Alba is faced with certain ruin if she can't come up with the cash, she is forced to resort to desperate means to raise the funds.  I promise I won't give away the ending.  Let's just say that it involves lots of adorable scamps handing out leaflets with the word ""Benefit"" on them, and the noble barber comes across with a place to perform (there were no barns available I guess), oh yeah and what movie like this would be complete without the established ""big Star"" coming to the rescue at the end.  Anyone old enough to remember the Brady Bunch TV show will know that like Davey Jones, of the monkees fame, another celebrity with a big heart and a big name will suddenly;y materialize and save the day.  Missy Eliot steals every scene she's in, she is easily the best part of this film, telling the evil dancer to ""call MC Hammer and tell him you been stealing his moves""  Ha Ha Ha, that never gets old.  She could have said ""Vanilla Ice"" too, that would have been better, I think.  But like in days of yore the lovable, energetic cast give it all they've got.  They do handsprings and twirl around a lot and dance there little hearts out, gee I wonder if, in the end, Honey will triumph, and the new center will stay and ""lil Romeo will see that the ""home boys"" he thought ""had his back"" were really just ""wack"" after all and will there be a lotta dancin and smilin during the end credits?  I promised I wouldn't give away the ending and I won't.  It would be easy to be critical of this film for the very same reason it should be praised.  Given a choice I prefer that the glass be half full then empty.  Even if we have seen this cornball story told a hundred times, there is always a generation of PG13 young people who will want to know that you don't have to sleep with someone to get ahead (it doesn't hurt to wear tiny tank tops that look like they were painted on though)that crime really does not pay, that people can overcome adversity (as long as they look really really hot and can dance).  So what if we've seen it, perhaps some other people haven't, this will never go out of style and perhaps it never should.",1076198400,71,4829,4.374439461883408

1987300,3,B0001CNRS4,"Honey (Alba) is raised in slum New York, where her mother runs a center to give kids a safe place to be that keeps them off the street and gives them constructive ways to channel their energy.  Honey teaches dance at the center by day and works at a dance club by night, hangin' wit her homegirls and practicin' her moves.  By chance she is discovered by the owner of a studio who produces music videos and he gives her a job choreographing, which is her dream come true, careerwise.  But when he tries to pressure her to sleep with him and she refuses, she loses her job and disappoints a group of young kids from the 'hood she has promoted for the latest video.
But Honey has vision and fortitude.  She has previously committed to opening a dance studio for inner city youth, and presses through with a commitment to see that come to pass whatever it takes.  With the help of her boyfriend and providence the dream is realized.
The most cool thing about this movie to me is that Honey was raised with the example of helping disadvantaged kids - modeled by her mother - and she takes her God given talent and takes it to the next level, in spite of obstacles that stand in her way.  The most powerful obstacle is her mother, who would like to see Honey get out of the 'hood.
This is a powerful movie that is very inspiring.",1074902400,2,1324,4.318548387096774
1987301,5,B0001CNRS4,"This movie is totally awesome. Jessica Alba shines. I really love her. I liked her in her series Dark Angel. You should definitely check this movie out. They had a lot of cameos like tweet, missy elliot, ginuwine, shawn desman, 3rd storee. I loved this movie and can't wait til it comes to dvd so i can own it myself.",1074643200,2,317,4.3
1987302,5,B0001CNRS4,"This movie was outstanding! For any one who likes dance, this movie is for you. Just watching Honey and the others dance makes you just want to get up and do your own moves!!!! Honey is an amazing dancer and the story has a wonderful message about making it ""on your own Terms.""",1074470400,,278,4.264150943396227
1987303,5,B0001CNRS4,This could have been a boring chick flick. I got conned into it by my lady friend. I only agreed to see it because Jessica Alba is a hottie. This is a really cool movie though. Honey Daniels is a dancer / bartender that wants to make it into the big time. She gets her chance from a music video producer. She also meets a group of kids including Lil Romeos charector a kid with heart who's mixed with the wrong crowd. She realizes she wants to help these kids and decides to open a dance studio.,1072656000,3,495,4.11340206185567
1987304,5,B0001CNRS4,"I am already in my lower 30's, and this is a movie I would definitly see again! This has always been my kind of movie. You know, teeny-bopper kind of movie. Ofcourse this was a more of a twenty something kind of movie, but the dancing was awesome! Jessica does some great sexy moves here. I've liked her since she was in ""Never Been Kissed"", and I was really into her ""Dark Angel"" series. Although this movie has sort of a weak story line, you know, young pretty girl, rough city, has ambitions, boss is a jerk, dream comes true, the end, I was really into all the dancing! The music was great as well. I recommend this movie!",1071792000,2,626,4.26890756302521
1987305,5,B0001CNRS4,"Jessica Alba truly makes this movie.  Raymond, a little 8 year old who she takes under her wing also is a scene stealer.  I saw this 3 times so far and it gets better everytime.  The soundtrack is great but is missing a few key songs from the movie.  Missy Elliot, Tweet, Lil' Romeo and Jadakiss made great appearances and in some cases performances.  Hopefully the DVD will have some deleted scenes because as you will see, some of the scenes could have continued a little bit longer.",1071792000,2,485,4.465909090909091
1987306,4,B0001CNRS4,"It seems that about once each decade there is a dance movie that captures the popular imagination, an ""Honey"" is definitely an attempt to be in the mold of ""Saturday Night Fever,"" ""Flashdance,"" and ""Dirty Dancing.""  Unfortunately while ""Honey"" is entertaining, and has some minor moments with regards to the dancing, it is not going to end up being in the league of those contemporary classics.  Still, from the dancing perspective, ""Honey"" does come out ahead of ""Save the Last Dance,"" but that is because Jessica Alba does more of the actual dancing than Julia Styles.  However, she does not do enough of it and the routines are not as exciting as they should be.
The story is rather incidental, because it is just an excuse to have people legitimately dancing as opposed to the musical tradition where people suddenly break into song and dance.  Honey Daniels (Alba) wants to be a dancer.  She works at a record store by dance and tends bar at a club at night, and when she goes off shift she struts her stuff on the dance floor.  Honey also finds time to teach hip-hop dance classes at the local center.  A toadie working for big name video director  Michael Ellis (David Moscow) records her on the dance floor and he brings her in to save the day on a video shoot.  The next thing we know Honey is not just dancing, she's doing choreography.  Her big dream is not to be the next Paula Abdul, but to open up a real dance studio for the kids in the hood.  Ellis derails Honey's plains, but the girl has got spunk, and, as everybody who has seen the ads for this movie knows, a pretty impressive guardian angel.  The problem with the story is the director character of Michael Ellis.  His idea of directing is a joke and I find it hard to believe that he is fooling every single one of these artists, except for the fact the story got written that way.  But none of that would have mattered if the dancing had been presented a lot better.
The character of Honey has lots of minor interpersonal problems that provide some breadth but not true depth of character, such as getting successful while staying tight with her best girl Gina (Joy Bryant), putting up with all the negative vibes from her mother (Lonette McKee), hooking up with Chaz (Mekhi Phifer) the barber, and keeping an eye out for brothers Benny (Lil' Romeo) and Raymond (Zachary Williams), who are a couple of at risk kids in the neighborhood.  For those who showed up to see what Jessica Alba is like without the barcode they will see some strong similarities with Max from ""Dark Angel"" in that Alba's best moments are when she is acting the big sister.  Whether dealing with escapees from Manticore or the kids in the hood, she connects with them.  Her best scenes are with the kids and her dance class.
The fault with this movie is not with the cast or even with the writers, the latter being excused because if you want to make a good dance movie the story is not as important as the actual dancing, so you if you want to go back and pull out the Andy and Judy bit about the kids putting on a show, that is not necessarily a bad thing.  The problem with ""Honey"" is that the dancing is not as great as it should be.  Honey is involved in a bunch of music videos, all of which involve real hip hop stars including Tweet, Ginuwine, Shawn Desman, Jadakiss & Sheek, Rodney Jerkins, and Silkk.  But the presentation of the dancing almost always is less than inspiring.  The initial scenes of Honey in the club set up things nicely, but director Bille Woodruff, a popular video director, must have really been aware that this was a big screen motion picture because there are only bits and pieces of flair for most of the movie.  The fault is not with the choreography of Luther A. Brown and Laurie Ann Gibson, but with the way Woodruff is presenting things.  We never seem to be getting an entire dance routine, just bits and pieces.  The best set piece is probably the one with Ginuwine and the kids, but all we get is part of a rehearsal and the camera angles and cuts do little to enhance our enjoyment of the routine.
Another part of the problem is that halfway through the film, Alba pretty much stops dancing as she turns into a choreographer.  A great dance movie is predicated on the star doing the dancing, whether we are talking Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly or John Travolta and Patrick Swayze.  Jennifer Beals can fool us with a body double, but that is not going to work twice, as Julia Stiles discovered.  The proof of the pudding here is in the final credits, where we get to see a complete music video (""directed"" by ""Honey Daniels"") and we are all sitting in the theater saying, ""Yeah, we wanted to see more stuff like that!""  A lot of people are going to enjoy this film, but most of those people are going to know that this could have been a lot better and that the fault here is not that of Alba but of Woodruff.  How ironic that the credits for this film show us how what had been good could have been great.",1070582400,25,4991,4.412213740458015

1987552,1,B0001CNRS4,"There's nothing especially bad about the story- it's pretty clear cut, if almost painfully predictable:  Big-city girl dreams of life as a dancer.  Parents don't really understand or openly disapprove (lampshaded here, as one does approve.)  Dreamer finds sponsor who turns out to be sleaze, dreamer doesn't just dream for herself, but for her entire neighborhood.  We even get the Fund-Raiser Held in Abandoned Building bit (jeesh, that one has mold on it, but whatever...) Like I said- simple, straightforward, easy-to-follow but don't hold your breath for a surprise plotline we've all seen done as well or better a thousand times already....

The problem here is Alba.  She isn't just a dreamer with a dream who wants to follow her dream and oh why does the world seem rigged to prevent her from living her dream?  Her character practically walks on water throughout the entire film.  She's not sweet- she's a bowl of sticky maple syrup who just can't get enough of children and teaching them (for nothing, apparently) how to dance and reach for THEIR dreams.  She's an eager- TOO eager- friend and counselor to one and all.  She stops short of serving up soup and sandwiches at a homeless shelter every morning at 4 AM, but that's about it- she is just way too perfect and nice to be believed, or believable.  This film could have ended with her being burned at the stake and ascending into heaven and I wouldn't have blinked.

The Sweet Innocent bit gets stretched to the breaking point when the incredibly gorgeous, sexy Alba is stunned to discover that her new manager is attracted to her- at first, she thinks he MUST be joking.  When she realizes that he isn't, she walks off in a chaste huff- back to the children who Just Want To Dream Just Like Her.

What would have helped?  If Alba's character had been shown honestly, well aware of her sexiness (she uses it unblushingly whenever she dances) even when she isn't performing, and maybe tossing out a curse word now and then just to let us know she isn't a wind-up toy.  Maybe if she had eased up on the I Love All Children bit- why does she visit Lil' Romeo's character in Juvenile Hall? What's her motivation?  Oh yeah- because she's soooooooo good.  Maybe if she had looked legitimately exhausted or discouraged or even a little pissed now and then.  No one goes through life with a delighted smile on her face 24/7.  Alba's Honey is just enjoying life waaaaayyy too much to be believed.",1392336000,,2453,4.686915887850467

1987677,4,B0001CNRS4,"Contrary to what other reviews state the entire series of 26 episodes was English-dubbed, not just the episodes found on the Sony VHS videos. The English-dub series was indeed televised and could be seen in the 1980's exclusively on CBN (Christian Broadcast Network). After that run and the limited VHS release, Honey Honey then sadly dropped out sight -- doubtless, the show was seen by many kids who must still have fond memories of it but unfortunately memory may the only way to access it unless someone was clever enough to tape the broadcasts.

I have all the Honey Honey factory VHS videos except for one, ""Alpine Express"". These tapes are nearly impossible to find and very likely not many were ever produced. In addition to the tapes I managed to obtain some ultra rare recordings off the religious TV station when it was aired years ago, not the complete series but I have enough to actually know what happened at the end.

This show was really poorly dubbed but that's actually good as the whole thing is so wacky that the dopey English voice talent fits the crazy antics perfectly. The further the story progresses the kookier it gets...they even have poor Honey in the clutches of a King Kong gorilla atop a high bldg type thing before its over. Strange plot twists and surprise Honey-isnt-what-she-seems-and-neither-is-Phoenix ending to wrap up the whole story.

1987748,3,B0001CNRS4,"`Honey' is not the greatest movie out there.  It's not even the greatest `dance' movie out there; but who are we kidding, none of us expected that.  Jessica Alba is not the greatest actress out there; she's not even really a `good' one, and she's not the greatest dancer out there either, but she is a good one, and she looks `good' dancing.  That pretty much sums up `Honey'.  Good looking girl dances well.  It doesn't matter that the reasons she's dancing is to help young kids in the neighborhood turn to dance over crime or that she dreams of furthering this cause by opening a dance studio for underprivileged inner-city children.  No, the only thing that matters is the fact that Jessica Alba looks good dancing.  Hey, I'm just stating the facts here.

Mind you; I'm not complaining.

The film follows young Honey Daniels, a girl who teaches young kids to dance at this worn out clich of a dance studio in `the hood'.  She's caught on video dancing in a club and recruited by a music video director to dance in his next video.  Obviously smitten with Honey the girl, not the dancer (since she doesn't dance any better then the other girls in the video) he decides to let her choreograph.  Things are looking up for Honey and soon she may have the means to really do some good for her community (since you know the hottie has to have a heart of gold).

Then this great guy who gave her the big break reveals his true intentions and all the good in her life starts spirally downhill.  She's losing the respect of the kids in the community and as a result come of them are turning to a life of crime.  She's losing the bond she had with her best friend because of her new career and with the sudden strain on her working relationship she risks losing the means to buy this great place to house a dance studio.

Honey, the condiment (can I call it that), is a great way to make a tasty dessert even more delectable.  If used properly, that syrupy sweet goodness can make any tummy more than happy.  If improper amounts are digested at one time though, one can become sick, to the point of vomiting even.  `Honey', the movie, is similar in that it can provide mindless fun at one moment but then deliver a migraine the next.  I prefer a little depth to my movies (and what this movie presents as `depth' can't really be called that since its delivery is laughable at best).  That isn't to say that there isn't something good to be found here.  If taken in the right doses then films like `Honey' can serve their purpose; they can make the viewer `happy'.  I just wouldn't suggest a diet that consisted of too much of this type of syrupy mess.

Besides; who doesn't love Mekhi Phifer?",1205798400,,2685,4.4105691056910565

1987750,5,B0001CNRS4,"*** SPOILER ALERT!!! ALTHOUGH I WILL TRY TO KEEP IT SIMPLE, SPOILERS MAY BE CONTAINED HERE!!!! ***

The Wonderful Adventures of Honey Honey (Honey Honey no Suteki na Boken, in Japanese)  first came out in the U. S. the early 1980's and it follows the story of a young orphan girl, oddly named ""Honey Honey"". Honey Honey's best friend is her cat, Lily, as Honey Honey has no parents or relatives of her own. Honey Honey works at a restaurant in lovely 19th Century Austria, during the national celebration of the Princess Flora's 19th birthday. Princess Flora is bored with her group of suitors from all over the globe. Her group of suitors include a California gold mining tycoon, Geronimo, the American Indian hero, an wealthy oil sultan, and of course, Gustav, the German military toughie. But Princess Flora was about to have more excitement than she expected, as she is charmed by no other than the good-looking Phoenix, The Phantom Thief.

During the Princess' birthday celebration ball, Princess Flora is tricked by Phoenix into removing ""The Smile of The Amazon"", her irreplaceable jewel, as Phoenix claims Princess Flora's beauty is a mere reflection of the jewel. Furious to hear such a remark, the spoiled Princess places the jewel inside a fish and tosses it down the alley next to the palace. Phoenix then makes his hasty exit to retrieve the jewel, but Honey Honey's cat, Lily, eats the fish and swallows the irreplaceable gigantic diamond.

Wanting to have fun with her diverse group of suitors who are stunned by her beauty, the spoiled Princess Flora, promises to marry anyone who can retrieve her diamond. Problem is Honey Honey is not about to give her her best friend Lily to the Princess' suitors, so she is forced to run away in the middle of the night. As she attempts to make her escape, Phoenix shows up and tries to get Lily from Honey Honey. Phoenix may be good looking, charming, and very smooth with the ladies, but he fails to surpass Honey Honey's love for her cat Lily, the only family she has ever known.

Honey Honey's name has a simple, yet interesting origin. She was found by nuns in a flower-filled field in the Spring, the time of the year when bees come to collect flower nectar to make honey. Thus, the nuns decided to name her Honey Honey. It makes sense, I guess. :) Honey Honey later discovers her origin and the story behind her parents leaving her in the flower field. This is, of course, thanks to the fact that she is forced to leave her job and travel throughout Europe. So Honey Honey traces her destiny as she travels and experiences the wonderful world of 19th century Europe.

The Wonderful Adventures of Honey Honey is an interesting early Japanese cartoon of the challenges and adventures of this young girl being pursued by a group of desperate suitors and the professional thief, Phoenix. Honey Honey is young and innocent, but she slowly blossoms into a young woman during her travels and discovers love for her charming pursuer, Phoenix. But can Honey Honey change the Phantom Theif??!

Anyone who is open-minded to the pure aspect of love and the simplicity of a young girl who risks it all for the love of her cat, will certainly fall in love with this older, yet much revered anime series all over the world.",1200787200,2,3269,4.694589877835951
1987751,4,B0001CNRS4,"I don't know why it's taken me so long to review this movie, but I have to thank Bravo for airing this movie this weekend and reminding me how much I love it. I know it's cheesy. I know it's been done. I don't care. I love Honey. And here's why: 1) Honey starts off as a bartender but she secretly wants to make her living as a video dancer. I always root for the underdog. 2) Everything Honey wears reveals her midriff. Everything. 3) Honey teaches inner-city kids how to dance and then puts them in a music video. That's hot. 4) The line, ""Someone wants to dip his fingers in the honey jar,"" said in complete earnest. 5) The wannabe thug manager who flips out when he can't get the girl. You've seen it before (think Terrence Howard in Glitter). 6) Honey's parents want her to dance ballet, but Honey loves hip hop and follows her dreams (think Save the Last Dance).

So yes. Honey isn't original. But hey, you steal from the best and make it your own. Honey does that. Yes it's got bits of Glitter, Flashdance, Center Stage, and any other dance movie you've seen in the last few decades. Yes. Honey is cheesy. But who cares? Enjoy it for what it is: a leisurely, entertaining film that ends in a dance sequence. What more could you want?",1194652800,2,1240,4.3218884120171674

1987753,4,B0001CNRS4,"After watching this movie I was very suprise to see how amazing it was and iI would recommand this movie to everyone of different age groups.  Honey (Jessica Alba) is a wonderful hip hop choreographer who tries to work her way up to the top with her talented moves.  Working at the center teaching her hip hop class keeps her motivated to try and be one of those hip hop dancers that is in the videos.  While on this journey she gets her big break of meeting a producer that can get her in the industry of music, but things doesn't go as planed.  After her ended relationship with her producer she has no hope of ever geting in the music business again but she doesn't let that bring her down.  Hopeing to get her own dance studio with the help of her boyfriend she rents a building and does a dance charity to help herself and the people in the community.  With all the trouble she had to go through she worked her way to the top with the help of family and friends and open up her own dance studio and also meet hip hop atrists on the way.

This is a good movie that can help motivate you and to help you realize the only person that can keep you down is yourself, so follow your dreams.

1987755,3,B0001CNRS4,"The only thing that (somewhat) seperates this ""beautiful star has good intentions for her 'people in the hood'"" film is that the racial lines are clearly drawn and somewhat offending, somewhat comical.

We meet Honey Daniels, who is a Hip Hop Dance instructor at the Community Center by afternoon and a Bartender by night that uses her ""after hours"" at the club to show off her moves. And, as we all seen coming, she meets a video producer one night at the club who offers her the opportunity she's been waiting for: to choreograph and dance in a music video.

Things on going well until the produce (a goofy looking white boy) puts on the moves on Honey and she shoots him down.  And, as expected, this same producer fires her, along with the 'hood kids she got dance parts for in the new video, and hires her dance-archenemy, Katrina.

Honey is so broken hearted; not about her loss, but the loss of those poor kids.  So she decides to do something about it: she wants to open her own dance studio.  Yet she lacks the funds to get off the ground.

Never one to be pessimistic, Honey devises a plan to raise the money: a dance benefit.  She's out pumpin' the neighborhood for donations while, in the meantime, that silly, oversexed white boy of a producer is preparing to produce a new video for Missy Elliot.  Elliot shoots the producer down when she finds out her video is going to be choreographed by Katrina (who Elliot describes as a thief of M.C. Hammer's moves) instead of Honey.

Just when Honey thinks she may have a tough go of raising the dough, that goofy lookin' boy pops up again and this time he's begging and pleading and apologizing to Honey trying to get her to come back to work for him.  This time, she bursts his little bubble with a resounding ""No!""

It's a story that has been done one too many times.  As with all the rest, it was okay but will never be ranked as a favorite. I'd recommend it only when cable offers nothing else; you know, like when it's those wee morning hours and there's nothing but infomercials...that's a good time!",1174089600,,2062,4.466666666666667

Jessica Alba may be beautiful but she can't act to save her life (at least she can dance) and Lil' Romeo is one of the most annoying little actors/rappers I've ever seen.  The story is sweet, even if it has been done a billion times, and the ending will make you smile but just don't expect this to be a movie you rave about.  Like I said, I like this movie, I'll watch it...but I can't defend it because as far as Hollywood fluff goes, this is at the top of the list.

One of the main reasons this film falters is that it tries way to hard to be a serious film instead of embracing its mediocre generality and just being that same ol' same ol' slice of American entertainment.  By trying to add that `the hood is a hard place' statement and the `do for others not for yourself' morale they end up making this film even more ridiculous and far-fetched than it is initially.  It's entertainment, and not all entertainment has to deserve an Oscar.  This is a fun way to pass the time, and Jessica moves real nice, so sit back and enjoy the mindless entertainment but don't expect to be see anything new or improved.",1167868800,2,1299,4.320987654320987
1987785,3,B0001CNRS4,"I stumbled on this while channel-surfing and was pleasantly surprised.  The ever sunny and optimistic Honey Daniels holds down two jobs in her increasingly hectic life - a bartender by night and a hip hop dance instructor by day. She has hopes of one day appearing in a music video, a dream that comes true when she catches the eye of a big time producer named Michael Ellis. Not only is Honey a smash in her first video appearance, but Michael immediately hires her as choreographer for one of his projects.

The movie wants to be taken seriously as a realistic view of urban life but very little of what we see ever rings true, starting with Honey herself who, with her invariably perky demeanor, seems like a cross between Little Mary Sunshine and Mother Teresa in form fitting jeans and matching halter top. Everything that happens to her - from her meteoric rise in the music video world to her purchase of an empty store for her new dance studio to the benefit performance she and her dancers stage to raise the money for the project - all come about way too easily and with virtually no noticeable effort on her part. We never believe for a moment that any of this would happen in this way in the real world.

Honey is really little more than an urban fairy tale, fine for children, I suppose, but not of much use for adults with a more pragmatic understanding of how life actually works.",1161993600,4,1395,4.484251968503937

That was one sick lousy move and one that will make you cringe. Honestly that kid sucked. There are tons of kids on Mtv and other TV dance shows that will have your jaws dropping. Check it out for Jessica, otherwise this is no big ""dance-movie"". There's a sweet romance between Jess and her lover that is worth watching though.

1987845,5,B0001CNRS4,"Is mine for Jessica Alba!  HONEY was filled with memorable dancers and a clutch of tunes that all sort of sound the same but have enough difference between them to disti8nghuish them-just.  Genuwine seemed like a creep because he accepted Katrina instead of Honey as a choreographer, I can't understand why Genuwine got himself talked into accepting a part which shows him to be so heartless he disappoints a whole community center's worth of little kids

By contrast, Tweet, who doesn't seem like she has much talent, shows that at any rate she's full of heart by showing up and paying money to get into Honey's big dance benefit, even after Honey's been blackballed out of the music video business by a jealous ex lover.

Lil Romeo showed some spunk as Benny, the little boy who would rather be a drug dealer than a dancer, for the movie

Jessica Alba is so beautiful and sweet in this movie you can easily believe she is the daughter of Lonette McKee, once the most beautiful woman in the movies and even here, at age 50 or so, still fantastic looking.  Poor Lonette is probably wondering why she doesn't get the plum parts she used to in such films as COTTON CLUB and MALCOLM X but she's got nothing to be ashamed about!  Her fans have never forgotten her crooning ""How Long Has This Been Going On?"" in ROUND MIDNIGHT and we will never will!  What they should have done in HONEY is have a duet with Lonette McKee and Missy Elliott.

Meanwhile Mekhi Phifer is adorable as the lovesick barber who clawed his way outta the gangs, and as for David Moscow (who plays Michael, the hyorndog viedo director), he was so cute in BIG and NEWSIES that we hope this turn towards sexual harassment is just a momentary aberration on his part.

The final number, ""I Believe,"" is just as good as the climax ""I Sing The Body Electric"" in FAME.  If only Jessica Alba danced in it my happiness would be complete,

The movie has every cliche under the sun but I wouldn't have it any other way.  I just wonder about one thing, why the head gangster (BB, played by Wes Williams), who threatens to make life miserable for Honey and Chaz doesn't do anything beyond making empty threats.  I thought at the very least he would have had one of the child gang members killed or the barber shop torched, or, well, I don't want to disappoint fellow viewers any more than we already are.",1127088000,5,2359,4.494145199063232
1987846,4,B0001CNRS4,"Kokusai Eigasha (Movie International) and the Korean arm of Toei Animation adapted Hideko Mizuno's 1966 manga into an anime TV series in 1981, ""Honey Honey no Suteki na Boken"" (Honey Honey's Wonderful Adventures).  Part of the series was dubbed into English and received limited video distribution across the U.S. courtesy of Sony, but its greatest success outside of Japan was probably in Italy, where it was screened on TV in its entirety with the heroine renamed ""Fiorellino."" I only managed to see the first episode which I rented from my local video store during my phase as a child when, raised on ""Superbook,"" ""Mysterious Cities of Gold"" and ""The Little Koala,"" I was seeking out and devouring everything anime.  The tape I rented only had the first episode, and I thought it was a ripoff - I wanted more.  So be advised: the U.S. release was only one episode per tape!
Our story begins in Vienna in 1907.  It's the day of the lovely Princess Florel's birthday celebration, and she is boredly interviewing potential suitors for marriage.  The princess hides her precious gemstone, the Smile of the Amazon, inside a fish and throws it out the window, declaring to her suitors that she will marry whoever finds the fish and returns it to her.  Meanwile, Honey (Fiorellino), a teenage girl who was abandoned as a baby and raised by nuns, is working as a waitress in a nearby restaurant.  Honey's cat Lily spies the princess's fish and greedily devours it, thus swallowing the ring!  The gentleman jewel thief Phoenix meets Honey afterwards and tries to charm Honey into selling him her cat, but Honey refuses and  attempts to escape by jumping into a hot-air balloon.  Thus begins a series of adventures that take Honey and her pursuers - Phoenix, who wants the ring for himself, and the princess's suitors, who want to get the ring so they can marry the princess - all over the world.
*SPOILER* The story eventually evolves into a ""Cinderella""-style fairy tale, with Honey marrying Phoenix and learning that she is really a princess herself - Florel's long-lost twin sister. *END SPOILER*
The U.S. dub wasn't too bad considering that in America, anime wasn't taken all that seriously in the 1980s - in fact, the translators didn't even bother to replace the Japanese writing on one sign in episode one with English words, perhaps because the technology wasn't readily available then? - but the series itself seems to be a nice mix of adventure, drama, and more than a little comedy.  (Just watch the opening animation, where Honey is decked out in evening wear and dancing with a handsome guy who proceeds to spin her into a table, resulting in her spilling punch all over herself.) The animation is also pretty good considering the series is now nearly a quarter-century old, and is actually better than that of ""Superbook,"" ""Urusei Yatsura"" and other better-known shows on Japanese TV at that time.  Phoenix is a '60s-looking hunk, complete with the huge sideburns, and Honey is really cute, a blonde who looks like a cross between Dolly Parton and ""Sailor Moon""'s Usagi.  The English theme songs were also really catchy - especially the very-'80s-disco-ish ending theme - and still stick in my head all these years later.

Overall, an entertaining and enjoyable shoujo series, especially for young girls (of course, that's what ""shoujo"" means).  Worth picking up if you can find it on VHS, but good luck, as what of the series that was released in America is out of print and will likely never see the light of day on DVD.  Apparently Enoki Films USA owns the rights to the show in America now, but I'm not sure what, if anything, they plan to do with those rights.  Information on the series in English is very hard to come by, so you'd probably do best to search for information on ""Fiorellino,"" the Italian dub.",1126137600,4,3822,4.792998477929984

'Honey' is not a bad film as some reviews might lead you to think.  What is really bad about the film is its awfully cliched story -- it is as if intentionally copying the old formula used in the Hollywood classics.

The film stars Jessica Alva plays Honey Daniels, hip-hop teacher at community centre.  Her best friend says, as if pointing to the next chapter the film is going to show, that Honey deserves stardom better than anybody else, because, you know, Honey can really dance.  And, as it turns out, Honey is spotted by a top music video director Michael, and instantly hired by him.

[I HAVE SEEN THIS] It is kind of amazing that the script of 'Honey' offers absolutely nothing original in its all too predictable story.  What does happen next when the video director invites Honey to the party?  What is the solution of Honey who must save the community centre which is facing a finacial problem?  Even the kids on the street (including Lil' Romeo) go on the predictable course, and their descriptions are perfunctory at best.

The dancing scenes are good, however, and though I still don't know Jessica Alva can really act or not, she is certainly attractive enough to convince us that her heroine Honey could be an overnight sensation in the competitive music industry.

Still, the film's story is so thin and predictable, like that of 'You Got Served.'  'Honey' is surely made with sincerity, I admit, and yes, I like Jessica Alva, but I really wish that such a good actor as Mekhi Phifer had done something better than providing a possible love interest, or I also wish that I could have seen David Moscow playing someone better than awfully stereotyped music video director.

Honey Daniels (Jessica Alba) works as a bartender at night. During the day, she also works in a record store, and in the afternoons, volunteers, teaching dance classes to underprivileged urban kids. When not helping to keep street kids off drugs and comforting old ladies, Honey dreams of becoming a dancing superstar.

After being 'discovered' while dancing in the club that she works at, Honey enjoys a meteoric rise to become the premier hip hop music video choreographer (within a week or two). But alas, the sinister Music Video Director Michael Ellis (David Moscow) begins to drool over the supple and lithe Honey. When the sweet and innocent Honey rejects his advances from her high moral horse, maintaining the movie's kid-friendly rating, Ellis tries to have her black-listed in the industry. Meanwhile, the community centre where Honey volunteers at is being closed. Oh oh, the poor homeless kids will have to put on a show to raise money to keep the centre open . . .

Although the movie tries to portray itself as deep by taking place in the 'hood, it just doesn't work. Alba's character (Honey) is bubbly and positive, which are good character traits. But her personality just doesn't fit in at all with the grimy inner city atmosphere of New York City.  The acting in the movie wasn't even that great. It was very amateurish except when it came to Lonette McKee and Mekhi Phifer. Lil' Romeo can't act to save his life and he can't dance either. Most of his dance moves looked like they were copied from one of Bow Wow's videos.  I give credit to Jessica for performing her own dance moves instead of using a body double like Jennifer Beals did for 'Flashdance.'

All the dance moves were tight, the themes were inspiring, and the soundtrack was BOOMING. This could have been a classic. But really now...if you're going to make a movie based on real life struggles within lower classed communities, the acting must be right. Apart, from Lil Romeo and the supporting cast who were great throughout the movie, Alba just didn't fit in.

1987948,2,B0001CNRS4,"**1/2 Credit ""Honey"" with at least having its heart in the right place - even if its brain isn't always so easy to find.  The ever sunny and optimistic Honey Daniels holds down two jobs in her increasingly hectic life - a bartender by night and a hip hop dance instructor by day.  She has hopes of one day appearing in a music video, a dream that comes true when she catches the eye of a big time producer named Michael Ellis.  Not only is Honey a smash in her first video appearance, but Michael immediately hires her as choreographer for one of his projects.  As is typical in these strive-and-succeed tales, Honey soon discovers that success is not all that it's cracked up to be when Michael reveals his true colors, setting up conditions for her continued employment that she hadn't quite counted on (in other words, ""put out or pull out"").  But the always-undaunted Honey is not about to be knocked down that easily.  She uses this little setback to start thinking less about herself and more about the street kids whom she sees turning into drug dealers and gangsters right before her rose-colored eyes.  Filled with a righteous zeal and determination, she rallies the neighborhood to raise money for a new dance studio that can get the youngsters off the street, channel their energies in a more positive direction, and turn their lives around.

Only the most Scrooge-like curmudgeon could object to the positive, laudatory, pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps message the film is trying to convey, and one would have to be downright inhuman not to feel uplifted by the final dance sequence.  But good intentions and noble aspirations do not, in and of themselves, make for a quality film, and ""Honey"" is a long way from fitting that bill.  The movie wants to be taken seriously as a realistic view of urban life but very little of what we see ever rings true, starting with Honey herself who, with her invariably perky demeanor, seems like a cross between Little Mary Sunshine and Mother Teresa in form fitting jeans and matching halter top.  Everything that happens to her - from her meteoric rise in the music video world to her purchase of an empty store for her new dance studio to the benefit performance she and her dancers stage to raise the money for the project - all come about way too easily and with virtually no noticeable effort on her part.  We never believe for a moment that any of this would happen in this way in the real world.  Thus, ""Honey"" is really little more than an urban fairy tale, fine for children, I suppose, but not of much use for adults with a more pragmatic understanding of how life actually works.

Jessica Alba is no great shakes as an actress, though she has an infectious smile and a bubbly demeanor that work well on screen.  But it is Zachary Williams, as the adorable, gap-toothed eight-year-old Raymond, who steals the show.  Now that is one hell of an endearing little kid.",1092441600,11,2927,4.6764132553606235

1987952,2,B0001CNRS4,"First, the obvious question - why was I watching this? Well, when my younger sister was visiting me she rented it, and half from morbid curiosity/half from Jessica Alba's abs, I sat in.
This film chronicles the journey of Honey Daniels, from teaching dance at the unspecified ""center"" all the way to stardom as a choreographer of the stars. Along the way she's confronted briefly by a mother who knows ""there's a whole beautiful world out there for her to see,"" the slimy agent who wants to exploit her, the unsympathetic best friend, domestic violence, and well...now I'm boring myself.
I'll start with positives: It could have been worse. It at least looked like a real movie with real actors (for the most part). Alba looks pretty amazing, and for what dancing there is, it's well done.
The problems...well...let's be realistic. You kind of know what you're going to get with a movie like this, so it seems almost bully-ish to bring up things like plot and dialogue. Unfortunately, every character in this movie is a walking, breathing clich&eacute;, with as much depth as a puddle in your driveway. If that seems unkind, consider that I called them ""walking and breathing."" That was benevolent. The other major problem is with the dance content. The only thing this movie really had going for it was Alba and her dancing. There isn't all that much of it. The story has her going off to be a choreographer, not a dancer, which takes her out of the action that most of this movie's potential audience wants to see. The only way for ""Honey"" to be successful would have been to cram it with Alba dancing. They didn't get that memo.
There are two reasons to see this film. 1) If you are an aspiring dancer and want some inspiration, and 2) if you really, really, really like Jessica Alba. I hope Alba gets past this one and makes some more films. She's much less annoying and much more talented than the current slew of canned actress/singers (Mandy Moore, Hillary Duff etc.). I did give it 2 stars, however, since it wasn't as bad as Glitter, the all-time low for movies of this type. If Glitter is 1-star, then this has to be at least 1 higher, so Jessica can thank Mariah for setting a standard so low that even this can surpass it.",1088899200,5,2234,4.5875

I thought the moves were so cool, & Jessica is so hot, & the moves were hot too!! I'm going to have disagree with anyone who doubts her acting abilities, or anyone here, the acting in this film is amazing!! Mekhi Phifer is amazing, I really admire that guy, he's funny & he's likeable in every movie I've seen him in so far. Lil' Romeo, I was wondering how he would turn out, actually he wasn't too bad, he's a good actor for a rapper. Actually, most rappers are pretty good actors these days, well, better then pop stars anyway, except the ones who changed into pop stars later(like Jlove or Hilary Duff, they might suck at singing, but they can act.) Back to the movie, if you were seeing this for Missy Elliot, well catch a different one, cause she's only in like 5 minutes of it, at the end. David Moscow is Michael Ellis, sometimes I hated him, other times I liked him, that's the only character I have mixed feelings about. & the thing that made the movie for me, the Honey/kid connection, I don't remember his name. That was so cute!! Plus, Chaz's crazy brother, he was awesome!!

 Hip-hop dancing is cool, they should have more movies like this, & Jessica has such a pretty smile, I would watch a movie just to see her smile, she's so gorgeous.

 Another thing I like about this film, they don't waste every effort just on swearing, just cause your black, you have to swear. That's so stupid!! Not everyone swears every second in real life, I think it's so stupid when there's tones of swearing in a movie, unless it makes sense(ex. Phone Booth or Turn It Up) but for the most part, I find it mindless. This movie however, has a PG-13 rating, & I like it for that!!

 Plus, you have to watch the outtakes, if you don't, then shame on you. It's the best part of the movie!!

 It's nice, relaxing film to watch, I definitely recommend it!!",1087257600,2,1953,4.346153846153846
1987985,2,B0001CNRS4,"Jessica Alba plays Honey, a sweet and sunny girl who teaches hip-hop to kids at the community center even though her mother tells her that she should be pursuing a career in ballet.
Honey is spotted by a director of music videos (David Moscow), and before you can say ""That flava's hot!"" she is lead dancer and choreographer. She is just about to achieve her dream of putting her students into a video starring Ginuwine when it turns out that the video director is interested in more than her dance skills. She turns him down and he fires her. Even worse, he fires the kids and makes her tell them.
She doesn't mind losing the job except that she does not know how she will get the money to buy that building she wants to turn into a dance studio so that she can give kids an alternative to thug life. How can she raise the money? Hey, let's put on a show!
Alba has a lovely smile and Joy Fisher (Antwone Fisher) adds some verve to the sassy best friend role. Hip-hop fans will enjoy seeing favorite performers like Tweet, L'il Romeo, and Missy Elliot. And the movie is very short, less than 90 minutes. This is the good news. The bad news is that it is just dumb, way past cheesy-but-fun into the realm of ""From Justin to Kelly""-level you-must-be-kidding. Its efforts to be hip make it as instantly out of date as if the characters used words like ""groovy"" and ""out of sight."" When Honey is under pressure to improve her choreography for one video, she gives the dancers a (presumably very expensive) break and goes for a pensive walk, where she draws inspiration from the moves of kids playing basketball and jumping rope. I'm not kidding. It wouldn't be so terrible that the plot, dialogue, and performances were so poor if the movie's reason for being -- the music and dance numbers -- had more energy and style. Worst of all, the movie fails to take advantage of the talents of performers like the glorious Lonette McKee (Jungle Fever) and Mekhai Phifer, who pretty much stand around looking embarrassed.",1086566400,2,2009,4.537190082644628

At no point in this film did anything seem even remotely REAL.  When Honey (Jessica Alba) leaves the CLUB out a side door and happens upon some neighborHOOD kids breakdancing in the alley I actually laughed outloud.  A few minutes into the ""conversatin'"", between Honey and the home-boys a couple of WHITE cops ask the street crew to move.  PLEEEEEEASE, this is so corny it's pathetic.
Maybe it's because I'm not into Hip-Hop that I felt this movie fell way short of a any mark one might shoot for.  It was just too calm, simplistic, and prejudice for me.  The drug dealer who confronts Honey on the street outside her apartment was like a ""G"" rated cartoon character - he was so nice.

I'd compare it more to Fame. Others compared it to the horrendous Mariah Carey bomb, Glitter, even though this film is far superior and executed quite nicely.

1988019,4,B0001CNRS4,"I popped Honey into my DVD player expecting a good hiphop dance movie- something similar to Save the Last Dance (although now after having seen both movies, these films cannot be fairly compared).
What I got was a great storyline, a very talented supporting cast, great dancing- and a little something more. Alba brings a sensitivity and a depth to the character Honey, a sense that she's chasing after her life's dream, she just doesn't know what it is.
While most dance movies focus on the main character and their obsession with dancing, this movie split that view two ways- into dancing, of course, but also into Honey's relationships and her passions outside of the hiphop club realm- which includes teaching a dance class at the Center her mom runs, a safe place for kids in the hood who want to get off the streets.
The movie has an excellent message and is very well acted. The supporting cast- including a lot of kids (!)- is awesome, and Alba makes Honey a deep character that we grow to love and support.
While the writers could have done more with the story and certain characters (such as Mekhi Phifer's), it was still very entertaining and suprisingly real and heartfelt.
The star-studded hiphop cameos are great to watch, as are the numerous special features on the DVD, including the full-length music videos of the songs and videos shot in the film, a hiphop dance class, and great deleted scenes, blooper reals, and behind the scenes stuff.

But why is the movie called Honey? Her co-stars and the other characters overpower her. The little children are so cute and so adorable they steal the screen. The movie is more about the children getting off the streets and doing something than it is about Honey finding her career. So if your just watchin it to see Jessica Alba shake her butt, then your wasting your money.",1080086400,,642,4.270491803278689
1988023,2,B0001CNRS4,This is a marginal movie that tries to exploit albas obvious appeal. Its not memorable except as an on screen launching pad for ms albas career. It is not fair to judge an actress only for first performances that can bring attention to her overall potential. I know she is very talented. I realize that sometimes these movies are inevitable. However she has already proven herself in dark angel. I will wager that her next moves will be to try a variety of concepts leading to big screen success. In the end i do not blame her for a foolishly made production by hollywood copycats. She is super. The movie?- is your decision. now you know mine.thank you !!,1079136000,,656,4.5210084033613445
