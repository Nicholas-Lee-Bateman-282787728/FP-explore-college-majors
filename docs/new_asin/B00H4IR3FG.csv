6131991,4,B00H4IR3FG,"In 1944 a bad FDR impersonator (Bredan Burke) orders a small group of soldiers to extract a mole, Claudia (Carly Kingston) from a Nazi run demonic research center in Poland. That is pretty much it. Some fighting, some demons, some killing.

Eli Dorsey who wrote and directed this film was clearly conceived at a Drive-in theater and spent his entire life there. The film uses western style swagger music for the good guys. Half of the Nazis wear a mask (not all the same) during this feature for no particular reason other than they were on sale at the army/navy surplus store. The cinematography of Claudia on a motorcycle was all old school with the mismatched scenery moving behind her as she is stationary with a fan blowing her hair.

Our group wears Nazi uniforms in case someone sees them, although who would notice a black man (Jamin Watson) in a Nazi uniform? Our mole hides a camera in her cleavage as she squeezes her breasts together to take a photo which makes a loud click, one that goes unnoticed by a room full of Nazis. If there is any criticism it would be they had too much woods fighting and not enough demon coverage.

Too much fun. 4 star cheese festival.

6131996,1,B00H4IR3FG,"This a comedy.  You have a story where four trained soldiers are to pick up a agent in Germany.  They are dressed in German soldier uniforms.  One of the soldiers is black who fought the Japanese previously.  On this mission, he carries a Samurei sword and a japanese banner on his forehead.  When they encounter a German patrol, the soldier who is a sniper picks off four German solders with his telescopic rifle.  He then puts his rifle on the ground and proceeds to pick off the remaining soldiers while running towards them while firing his pistol.  It gets worse from there.  The leader of the group is a Captain who is a former priest who has to perform an exoricism.  The black soldier has a sword fight.  The agent and the  German scientist are two buxom blondes that are so well built that either one can button their top of their blouses.  This is a comedy!",1481241600,,867,4.452229299363057

6132021,3,B00H4IR3FG,"First of all - yes, this is just a terrible, terrible movie. Do yourself and humanity a favor by watching an hour and half of SciShow videos on YouTube.

With that said, there are at least a few people out there who may actually enjoy this movie. So for you 3 or 4 folks - here we go.

Im about 99% certain the the opening shot, which has the camera sweeping over what appears to be pine trees in the American northwest, is the opening footage from Twilight. Letters appear on the screen and let us know that its actually occupied Poland, circa 1944. Theres a typewriter sound effect thats supposed to go along with the titles telling us this, but it doesnt match up with how the letters appear, or even match up the number of letters that appear.

At least its not Twilight. I think we can all be thankful for that.

With that said, nothing about this movie makes any logical sense.

Example - when the group of elite American soldiers are on the plane heading to where they're going to be dropped behind enemy lines in Poland, one of the soldiers asks their commander why they're wearing German uniforms. Now - youd think that someone would have discussed the plan with them beforehand. Hey, you're going to dress up like Nazis and drop behind enemy lines in order to stop these crazy occult Nazis. But apparently this didn't happen. Instead, what we have to assume, is that someone came up to these soldiers after their missions briefing - which is shown in the movie as a movie that the soldiers watch in which their mission is explained to them, which is kind of weird in itself since this is supposed to be 1944, so why wouldnt someone just come in and explain the mission instead having a film record of it that might fall into enemy hands? Anyway, I digress. So after the briefing, someone must have come along and handed them Nazi uniforms and told them to put them on. And the soldiers were all like, Yay! We like dress-up! But then it festered and festered in this one guys mind until he finally asks a minute or so before they're about to drop into Poland, Why are we wearing German uniforms anyway?

Also, one of the American soldiers is black and wears a Japanese headband and carries a samurai sword. Except for a tank battalion, there were no integrated combat units in the European theater until March of 1945. Of course, they throw in some racial tension between a hillbilly soldier and the black soldier that results in a fist fight, but I won't spoil the movie by telling you if by the end they learn to see each other as people and become friends.

Now, I see a lot of people comment that this is porn. I didn't see any porn. The filmmakers managed to find a couple of  good-looking blondes with fake breasts to show off said breasts. But other than that, there wasn't anything even close to resembling Skinamax. If you're looking for an ultra-low-budget WWII Nazi-occult softcore porn, youll have to look elsewhere. I suggest you check with your local chiropractor. I hear they're into all sorts of weird stuff.

Listen, this movie looks like someone scraped some money together and made a movie that they thought would be fun. They probably got with some local WWII reenactment groups and borrowed gear and went to town with what what they had. All of the effects look like something you could put together with After Effects and an afternoon of Andrew Cramer tutorials. The plot - I don't even know what the plot is. This is a movie for a very specific niche - people who enjoy terrible micro-budget movies that are one step above kids running around with camcorders - and not much of a step above at that. The dialogue is a train that wreck that fell into a cesspool of toxic medical waste (Do you believe in God? Yes. Why didn't you become a preacher? Cut to next scene). The cinematography is - well, I assume that the cinematographer and whoever was responsible for the sound design were at the bar and simply forgot that they were supposed to be handling the cinematography and sound design for a movie somewhere.

But if you enjoy watching these kinds of movies - and I have to admit that sometimes I do - then this might worth checking out.

However, if you're looking for a half-decent war flick, or an entertaining horror movie, or any kind of movie that has any redeeming qualities, then for the love of God don't watch this.",1464566400,9,4359,4.498103666245259
