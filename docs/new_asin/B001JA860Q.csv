8312188,5,B001JA860Q,"Setting the production during the age of Puritans was inspired--think ""Scarlet Letter"" and Monica Lewinski. Kate Nelligan's Isabella reminds us of a young Ingrid Bergman, gorgeous in her virginal restraint, and Tim Pigott-Smith is simply the best Angelo imaginable. Why isn't this actor called out to act in every big-budget Harry Potter movie or Judy Dench-weeper ever filmed? His work in this is deep and surprising and fascinating to watch. Frank Middlemass's Pompey harkens back to the Cockney bravado of Robert Morley, and this production captures John McEnery in the finest film performance this actor ever delivered following his heartbreaking Mercutio in Zefferelli's Romeo & Juliet. His Lucio is ripplingly funny!

Alas, it's hard to know what Shakespeare was up to with the character of Duke Vincentio although I like an earlier reviewer's suggestion that he's in search of his Dukedom's only truly virtuous soul. Doesn't make me like the character any better, though! Kenneth Colley does his best Obi Wan Kenobi as the inscrutable Duke, but it would take a genius like Mark Rylance to allow us to actually LIKE the old meddler.

Nevertheless, this is a very clear and compelling production, maybe the best of the BBC Shakespeare series.",1407628800,,1247,5.199004975124378
8312189,5,B001JA860Q,"I consider myself very lucky to own a DVD of this play which
Is one of my favorites.  The acting is superb and Shakespeare also.
Gratefully when Shakespeare lived, they had not heard of
Political correctness.  Brilliant dialogue.",1376784000,5,229,5.0
8312190,2,B001JA860Q,"I was really excited to share a theatrical production of my favorite Shakespeare play in class as a treat... and sadly, it had the opposite effect.  My students begged me not to finish showing them the film.  It was boring... pathetically boring.  When compared to the plays I showed before this, Much Ado About Nothing and Titus Andronicus, I assured my class the best was yet to come.  I am now looking for a better version to show my kids, because this performance was a real let down.  I begged them not to let this film ruin their impression of this complex and thought provoking play.

On a positive note, I do think that the actors who portray Isabella and Angelo are quite talented, but sadly, their skill is not enough to save this shipwreck of a performance.  If anyone can recommend a better version, please let me know!!!",1366416000,2,833,4.550335570469799
8312191,5,B001JA860Q,"Nothing short of astounding. The play is extraordinary, and speaks to our age in a unique way. The play is set in a licentious time when public sexuality is rampant, most citizens are scofflaws (and why not? no law is enforced), and the virtuous are cloistered. In other words, it's about 2012 A.D. The Duke of Vienna at the start hands the reins of power over to his stern deputy (chief of police) and goes underground in order to return disguised as a priest to find out what's really going on. Meanwhile, the deputy condemns a man to death for living in sin with a pregnant fiance, then meets the condemned man's sister, Isabella, a nun-to-be come to him to beg for her brother's life--and promptly falls for her. After the deputy propositions her, the Duke (disguised) tells her to pretend to go along with the deputy. The play ends, preposterously, with the deputy exposed and forced to marry his first betrothed, and the Duke proposing to Isabella (which is why it's considered a ""problem"" play--the Duke and Isabella aren't in love). Critics have spent centuries trying to figure out the end of this play. I figured it out. The Duke is attempting to locate the most virtuous person in his realm. He finds her--and why wouldn't he want to align with her? Now for the 1979 BBC TV production. All parts are faultlessly played, from Kevin Colley as the Duke; to Kate Nelligan as Isabella (my favorite performance of a Shakespearean heroine ever); to Tim Pigott-Smith as the deputy (he shifts from law enforcer to rapist in a single line); to John McEnery as the foppish Lucio; to Adrienne Corri as Mistress Overdone, madame of the main whorehouse in Vienna; to Christopher Strauli as Isabella's condemned brother, who doesn't want to die just yet; to William Sleigh as Barnadine, a convict too drunk to be executed that day; to Frank Middlemass as Pompey, the malapropping clown who (with Lucio) turns this drama a bit towards comedy. Director Desmond Davis makes all the right artistic choices in this curiously undramatic but nevertheless fascinating think piece.",1354492800,6,2068,4.828169014084507
8312192,5,B001JA860Q,"This is one of William Shakespeare's so-called problem plays -- and it is certainly strange, yet superbly dramatic.  The curious nature of the play is that none of the characters are really likable, as we find in the comedies.  Yet in this production, I was able to feel sympathy for Isabella, who is flung into a profoundly distressing situation and choice.  Kate Nelligan is superb; she has youth and beauty, but these aspects are not used to conjure characterization -- she seems authentically distressed when the man who has condemned her brother to death suddenly reveals his sexual lust for her.  The actress handles with expertise the severe morality that is one basic aspect of her persona.  She never overacts in a role that could become melodramatic, but is always realistic and, for me, exactly right.  I found her performance mesmerizing.  One feels keenly the fear of death in the minor part of her brother, Claudio.  I felt absolutely no sympathy for the Duke, played here by Kenneth Colley -- who is portrayed as a curious leader who feels very little human warmth in his preoccupation with matters of justice.  Especially brilliant is handsome Tim Pigott-Smith as Angelo -- we feel keenly his sudden lust, and his bewilderment at this sudden desire.  Although this is such a heavy play, it has moments of wonderful humor, and Frank Middlemass is delightfully amusing as Pompey.  Production is superb.  There are many delicious moments, such as Isabella's pause and lowering of her head before she accepts the Duke's proposal or marriage.  Highly recommended!

For a really excellent source on this BBC series, check out BBC TELEVISION SHAKESPEARE at Wikipedia--it's amazing!  It gives the history of the series, director, taping dates and full cast of all 37 plays, and with some wee yet information ""behind-the-scenes"" summaries.",1262217600,14,1846,5.066225165562914
8312193,3,B001JA860Q,"""Measure for Measure"" reuses a plot device in another of the comedies of having a woman sleep
with the man who is her reluctant husband.
The fellow who plays the Duke, Kenneth Colley, is very good.
I thought that someone younger and more gentle should have
played Isabella for her to have conquered the hearts of the Duke and Angelo both.
Kate Nelligan is too old and too plain.
but overall the staging and costumes were well done
and most of the characterizations were fine as Lucio
was very well done by John McEnery.
I enjoyed the play over all.",1258156800,2,548,4.49
