8759919,5,B01F0XL2KS,An absolute thriller to the very end. I loved it and I never saw the end coming.,1528588800,,80,3.764705882352941
8759920,2,B01F0XL2KS,"Ever since I purchased ""CUB"", I have fallen in love with Art Sploitation Films as a distributor. Purchasing every release I can get my hands on. An absolutely amazing indie film line up so far. And after seeing a trailer for ""The Perfect Husband"" I insta-bought it. It looked incredibly dark, twisted, brutal and creepy; feeding into one of the many avenues that leads to the happy place in my brain-pan. Though, sadly it delivered zero of those things. Which isn't a bad thing in my book. So the film didn't reflect it's marketing, it happens. Was the film still well made and recommendable? Hmmmm... The story idea itself was actually compelling, but the dialog more often than not was poorly written, to the point that I was laughing when I definitely should not have been. The acting was good in brief moments, and horrible in others. The editing was all over the place, and the sound mixing was confusing and laughable at times. Also the ADR was very bad, like bad bad. If this film was a parody, it would be an amazing film haha, the serious tone/story juxtaposed by laughable writing/acting/editing and sound.. sheeeit that would be golden. I did however, like the cinematography, the framing made it feel like there was something always looming just off the edge of the screen, which at times added a real ominous feeling and gave breath to the film. I dug the color filter, and again there were moments when the acting was pretty solid, but the film as a whole just fell short for me. This isn't a bad film, I enjoyed it (mainly due to convincing myself halfway through that it was a parody), but I can't recommend it. 2/5 because the cinematography was great, and there were some well-groomed moments, times when the film found itself, but those moments were just too few and too far between.",1495411200,,1802,4.652037617554859

8759923,4,B01F0XL2KS,"Nice little thriller with some gore.  A couple, still grieving the loss of a baby, go away for a weekend to reconnect.  Then we see the husband is quite abusive towards his depressed wife.  An unexpected twist at the end that takes an already done plot and makes it new.  The acting is B+ at best.  A little better than say Tara Reid or Tori Spelling but definitely no Julianne Moore.  This movie was fun to watch once but you probably won't watch it a second time.",1481760000,,465,4.287356321839081

8759925,4,B01F0XL2KS,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Dont let the title of this film fool you; this is not a Harlequin romance or Lifetime movie.  Oh, no, no, no.  This is something much more fun.  This is one of those films that starts off all sweet and innocent, but then quickly spirals into a blood-soaked trip of mayhem and madness.  And I loved it.  While not perfect, this is a heck of a film, and I highly recommend giving it a look.

Im happy to state THE PERFECT HUSBAND is not what I thought it was going to be.  I figured the couple would be terrorized by a maniac or something.  I never imagined it would be the two of them going after each other!

THE PERFECT HUSBAND is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The production value seems high, and the overall feel of the film is polished and well-made.

The acting is very good, with both Gabriella Wright and Bret Roberts giving outstanding performances.  With that being said, I had a bit of a problem with the characterizations, particularly that of Viola (I am assuming this comes from the script).  It was difficult for me to feel for her because, frankly, she was a bitch to her husband for most of the opening scenes of the film.  I understand the trauma that can result from a lost pregnancy, however I feel like she was too hateful for me to care about.

This lack-of-feeling for her character, therefore, led me to not care as much about her later on in the film as well.  And even though things get crazy halfway into the film, I found myself almost enjoying what was happening to her.  I won't give anything away, but I will say I actually enjoyed the ending and I found it satisfying in a sense.

THE PERFECT HUSBAND won't be for everybody (some will find it difficult to watch), but I enjoyed it for the most part, and I do recommend it.  Full of great special effects and some gut-wrenching imagery, this is a film that will haunt your mind long after the credits roll.",1470268800,4,1966,4.3489010989010985

8759927,2,B01F0XL2KS,"Nicola (Bret Roberts) and Viola (Gabriella Wright) are going to have a baby who is going to be a doctor and a lawyer. When the baby is stillborn, this creates psychological issues. Nicola takes Viola to a remote family cabin for a getaway, although neither one seems normal as the film digresses into a WTF blood and gore fest, followed by a light clued twist that says, ""see how clever we are?""

The characters were odd and I couldn't connect to any of them. The twist needed better clues as it comes on you all of a sudden. The dialogue did nothing for me. The was disjointed by design to show a mental state, by it lacked entertainment value because you don't realize it until the film is almost over. Might be better a second time through, or watching it knowing the over used ending.
