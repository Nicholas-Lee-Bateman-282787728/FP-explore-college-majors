8301393,4,B001FAEN84,"After viewing this interesting offering of JUST the goals of Euro 2008, I can say that overall I felt that it did a pretty good job and I enjoyed myself while watching it. I emphasize the word JUST because that is what you get and see. You DO NOT see....1. Highlights, 2. Red Cards, 3. The foul that leads to a penalty, 4. Any penalties that were missed. You also don't see any shoot-outs either, which was kind of disappointing (They aren't open-play goals, so they don't count apparently?!) Anyways, the Goals are fantastic, and it is a nice piece of history to hold onto....4/5!",1393372800,,581,4.542857142857143

A very entertaining encapsulation of all the goals scored during the past summer's Euro 2008 championship won by long-suffering Spain. Relive the amazing goals scored by the vaunted Spaniard short-passing attack, the flair of the Dutch and the Teutonic precision of the Germans and the artistry of the Portuguese. Definitely worth a look see.",1232150400,,522,7.15625
