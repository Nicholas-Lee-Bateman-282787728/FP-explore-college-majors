The work farm is owned by unfeeling,selfish,pervert,Russ Tropp(John Russell)whos only interest is making a profit.
The judges son,Bob(Don Burnett)freash out of the army is hired as foreman by Tropp because the judge sends him cheap convict labor. Bob falls for pretty Jane,but he frowns on the poor working conditions. There is little Bob can do when he finds his mom is married to the evil Tropp.
Back in its day this raised a lot of eyebrows and was banned by religious groups. Now a days it wouldnt get a PG rating.
John Russell was a decorated Pacific World War Two Hero who got the Battlefield Commision.
Eddie Cochran and Mamie sing us some cool 1950s tunes.",1345852800,7,891,4.754838709677419
4114022,1,B003EGD5KO,"I don't usually write reviews, but I was so disappointed in this purchase I felt compelled to. I was glad to receive the DVD so quickly, but when I started to watch it, I was no longer happy about the purchase. It looks like a copy of a recording that was taped on a VCR from a public television station in 1983- just to clarify, I am describing the picture quality--not saying there is any evidence of how it was recorded.  The entire picture is scratchy and severely washed out. During the outdoor scenes, the faces and any other details cannot be seen--truly disappointing not being able to make out Eddie Cochran's face--the only way to know it was him was to recognize his voice.  Believe me, I was not expecting a crispy HD-quality video, but seriously, the quality is really bad.

Update (1hour, 20 min. later):  I changed my review from 2 stars to 1 star because the video loses sound during Mamie's Calypso bit, then stutters and cuts off before the real ending. Just to be sure it wasn't my DVD player I popped in a different DVD to check, and it's NOT my DVD player.  The crappy quality of this video is confirmed.",1344384000,9,1125,4.441747572815534
4114023,4,B003EGD5KO,"Mamie Van Doren was one of the several gorgeous buxom blonde bombshells of the 1950s who was molded to compete with the legendary/unforgettable Marilyn Monroe for box office popularity. Though Van Doren never reached the superstar status as Monroe and didn't appear in many creditable films, she did however become a popular sex goddess of the 1950s. In ""Untamed Youth"" (1957), Van Doren stars along with Lori Nelson as a sister act who get arrested for skinny dipping and hitchhiking and get sentenced to work on a rural farm miles away. The film's quality is moderate (B-) and the plot is somewhat meaningless and goes no where (a C). The four stars are for Mamie Van Doren and for what she made work with what little Warner Brothers gave her to work with. Mamie and so many other blondes during this era, including Sheree North, Cleo Moore, Anita Ekberg, Barbara Lang, Greta Thyssen, and Barbara Nichols, could've been way more if studio could've gotten off their pedistals and put them in fans based on their talents and not the talents they were trying to take from Marilyn Monroe and put in them! However, Monroe remains an icon even to today and remains as my favorite and the most beautiful actress of the 1950s.",1343001600,,1220,4.732394366197183
4114024,5,B003EGD5KO,"A sister act (Mamie Van Doren, who sings and Lori Nelson, who plays guitar) are hitchhiking from Illinois to L.A. but somehow end up down south where they're caught skinnydipping by the law. They're arrested for the hitchhiking rap and sentenced to a work farm where they have to pick cotton. The farm is run by a very corrupt boss, the conditions are horrible and their ""chow"" is dog food. Arf! Yet, they still get to sing (well, Mamie does) and rock'nroll with the other ""untamed youth"" who are inmates on the farm...even as things start getting deadly.  This little b&w item is a time capsule from a bygone era. Van Doren was a platinum blonde sex kitten and she is on full display here singing and gyrating to songs like ""Salamander"", ""Rolling Stone"", ""Ooh Bah Lah Baby"" and ""Go Calypso Go"". Nelson had previously been the heroine of ""Revenge of the Creature"" (1955) and ""Day the World Ended"" (1956) but here she is the tough one of the two, winner of a catfight with another female inmate early in the film. The script is chockfull of unbelievable dialogue, zingers and some rather unsavory situations---one being a major subplot. But it's all so unintentionally funny and jawdropping you find yourself enjoying it. I appreciate Warner's Archives for releasing this. I ordered directly from their site and the print is not restored but it is fine and clear nonetheless. I recommend it highly for pure camp entertainment and those who love the 50's ""juvenile delinquency"" melodramas. I'd love to see DVD releases of other Van Doren films like ""Guns, Girls and Gangsters"" (1958) and ""Girl's Town"" (1959). They're good stuff also.  Mamie Van Doren is still around, looks great and has her own website. She recently launched her own wine label and posed nude for it! So check out  ""Untamed Youth"", it's real gone, man.",1266624000,22,1819,4.786624203821656

8395454,2,B003EGD5KO,"I ordered Untamed Youth some years ago from Amazon, and I'm just now giving it a review. First off, I must specify that I ordered this movie only because I've read (on multiple occasions) that this was one of the better movies starring Mamie Van Doren. Miss Van Doren is one of the two blondes from the 1950s (the other being Kim Novak) still alive today. Of course, like the others, Mamie was placed in the Marilyn Monroe mold, but not even a beautiful dish as Mamie could hold a candle to Marilyn. No way, no how. Mamie just didn't possess the charm and likable on-screen personality to match her attractiveness; in fact, she comes off rather dull and very uninteresting. She seems so fake. Her sexiness seems completely forced. She's just like in your face and not very captivating.

Untamed Youth has many problems. The writing is pretty bad; the acting is bad; the video is bad; the audio is bad. Shall I go on? I most certainly could, but I won't. I can't say that I am really disappointed. From what I've read, almost all of Mamie's movies were of this quality, and the majority of her fans considered her an inferior actress. Beyond Mamie, the rest of the cast is pretty dull and forgettable as well. I couldn't even finish this movie. Yes, it was that bad! I watched maybe the first 15 or 20 minutes and after I seemed maxed out on extreme boredom, I took it out and found something better to waste my time watching. I guess if you like really bad old movies, this movie will be your cup of tea; but, if you're looking for good ole entertaining camp, this definitely isn't it. I certainly didn't like this movie and it's a very safe bet that I won't be ordering any other Mamie Van Doren movies.",1436832000,,1704,4.426751592356688

8395456,1,B003EGD5KO,"This was an awful movie with bad directing, terrible music and pitiful songs by Mamie Van Doren.
John Russell looked like he was trying to imitate Ponch with his tight fitting shirt. Eddie Cochran was too
young to really show what he would one day become and was limited to singing the awful ""Cotton Picking""
song. The only positive was Mamie Van Doren doing the Calypso song near the end of the movie.",1434672000,,402,4.52054794520548

8395458,2,B003EGD5KO,"Another cautionary tale about hitchhiking and cotton empires.  A pair Hitchhiking hotties take farm life gig over serving 30 days of jail. There they encounter Pinky,  an erudite talent scout/dishwasher and work for the original monopoly hoarding Mr Trump. Inspire of the backbreaking field work the titular untamed youth still have time for jitterbugging and several impromptu jive numbers that may lead them to fame in the city. Okay, It's no Manos but this delightfully bad teen exploitation fare can make a fair drinking game film if you drink each time ""cotton picking""  is said or someone is called a square.",1426377600,3,614,5.0594059405940595
