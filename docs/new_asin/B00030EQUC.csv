8035716,5,B00030EQUC,"The prologue is a very nice piece: the Lilac Fairy is quite glamorous in her gown and her miming is soft, compared to Carabosse's jerky, angry movements. She also smiles beautifully at every opportunity she gets. Carabosse appears as a sly, mean opposite of the Lilac Fairy. She looks really regal in her black gown and snarky more than anything else. All of the six fairies and their cavaliers dance effortlessly: they make the choreography look very easy.

Act 1 introduced me to Sofiane Sylve's Aurora. Though she definitely looked over sixteen years old, her confidence during her Rose Adagio was a giant plus. Her variation afterwards made her more like a teenager: she looked really shy, but wasn't afraid to show off her talent. The other dancers did really well, perfect with their timing. Everyone was in pure hysteria when Aurora fell asleep - I had never seen such chaos like that before. The King and Queen's acting as two mournful parents was very convincing. To my great pleasure, Aurora was kept onstage upon a bed-like bench instead of dragged off by the four princes. The Lilac Fairy also made me feel that everything was going to be just fine when she put the kingdom to sleep.

Act 2 introduced me to Gael Lambiotte's Prince Florimund, whose acting is just superb. All the dancers there were just as perfect as those in Act 1. The setting was very believable as a forest at night. Gael was as confident as Sofiane with his dancing: I wanted to watch his variation a thousand times over. Then, Sofiane appeared with the Lilac Fairy and her sylphs and they danced like it was no one's business. I got to see Carabosse's true nature when Florimund went off in search of Aurora: she was the embodiment of evil. The moment Florimund gets near the thorny place, she is determined to kill him - either by making him strangle himself or by sending her minions after him. At the end of the act, Sofiane and Gael dance the cutest pas de deux together as Aurora and Florimund. I could so see one of them asking the other what their favorite color was as they danced.

Act 3....I loved it! Every single dancer onstage was purely confident in themselves - awesome acting and dancing by all. You can also see in the costumes and setting (which is more varied in color and has certain differences in it) how the kingdom has changed after 100 years.

Overall, Dutch National Ballet has definitely showed me what a powerhouse they are. Sofiane's performance grew and grew as Aurora while Gael seemed to let her keep the spotlight throughout. It was a very enjoyable performance that I will definitely watch again in the future.",1450051200,,2629,4.6594827586206895
8035717,5,B00030EQUC,"This is my favorite version of the Sleeping Beauty. The two lead dancers
are excellent. The costumes are beautiful. Even the corps dancers are quite good.",1388275200,,154,4.961538461538462
8035718,1,B00030EQUC,"Although there are a great many people who know more about the dancing aspect of ballet than I do, I will defer to no one when it comes to the appreciation of music. Although I love all aspects of ballet, to me the music comes first. Tchaikovsky's ""The Sleeping Beauty"" is my favorite. I had previously written a review of this ballet performed by the Royal Ballet, criticizing it because of all the magnificent music that was left out of that recording.
  I recently purchased this DVD by the Dutch National Ballet (Het Nationale Ballet) because there were several very good reviews by Amazon purchasers, and the listing of the dances appeared to contain more of the music than most versions. Boy, was I wrong! Although TWO discs are used, it contains LESS music than just about every other recording of which I am aware. The Prologue and Act 1 are fairly close to being complete, but what a chopping job they have done with Acts II and III. What a waste of space! Nor only are dances completely omitted, but many are abridged. Both result in substantially less of the written music being played. The Asylmuratova VHS tape, even though the picture quality is not nearly as good as the modern DVDs, especially in the Prologue and Act I where much of the dancing is in almost total darkness, at least contains most of the music.
  I realize that many, many DVD viewers will not agree with this. You may feel that the viewing good dancing, even in an abridged ballet, is sufficient enjoyment. If that is your view, more power to you, and I hope that your enjoyment increases over the years. We all have different opinions, and mine is that I wish the ballet companies did not take such liberties.
  I will now list all of the dances of ""The Sleeping Beauty,"" and state whether each one is complete, abridged or omitted.

8035719,5,B00030EQUC,"Don't panic!! This wonderful ballet is still available from KULTUR and at a reasonable price.....<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sleeping-Beauty/dp/B001PSVHLC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sleeping Beauty</a>.....It is the same ballet performance. So don't pay an inflated price.

No better version of The Sleeping Beauty exists IMO. That is, in the six copies I own. I've only been collecting Ballets on DVD since February of 2008, so I will not claim to be an expert on ballet, and The Sleeping Beauty in particular. However, I already know WHAT I LIKE, and this one I like. Next on my favorite ""Beauty"" list, is the Australian Ballet version, with Christine Walsh and David Ashmole.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleeping-Beauty-Christine-Walsh-Australian-Ballet/dp/B0017HEYAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleeping Beauty  / Christine Walsh, Australian Ballet</a>&nbsp;They are the couple who got me started on my love affair with this so beautiful art form. Though I have seen a few live performances, of ballet, it didn't dawn on me just how beautiful it can be.

The Het National Ballet version (here-in-after to be called the Dutch version) has the most sumptuous sets and costumes of any version I've seen, although the Australian version comes close. Peter Wright explains in the bonus material, that the roles of the Lilac Fairy and Carabosse should be mime rolls, which they are in this version, even though Carabosse does a bit of dancing, she is in a full length gown befitting an evil queen. This Carabosse is played by a woman which is better than a man imitating a woman. Again, this is my opinion. The Russians seem to like a man in this role, but it seems clownish, as the ones I have seen overact the role.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tchaikovsky-The-Sleeping-Beauty-Semizorova-Fadeyechev-Speranskaya-Kopilov-Bolshoi-Ballet/dp/B000A16I32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tchaikovsky - The Sleeping Beauty / Semizorova, Fadeyechev, Speranskaya, Kopilov, Bolshoi Ballet</a>&nbsp;A woman playing the part of a woman simply works better.

""Beauty"" is played by the brilliant Sofiane Sylve and The Prince is Gael Lambiotte. They look good together and their dancing is spectacular. One added piece in this Dutch version which I have not seen in any other, is a PDD just after the Prince wakes her with the kiss, to the same Tchaikovsky music used in the NYCB production of Balanchine's ""The Nutcracker"" for Marie's dream sequence.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/George-Balanchine-s-The-Nutcracker/dp/6304698577/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">George Balanchine's The Nutcracker</a>&nbsp;It is a very beautiful melody and it is good to see it used here in the PDD at the end of the second act. Sylve is a very convincing young Aurora, and enters the first act with youthful vigor and vitality, with bounding leaps and fast turns. Yes, she did wobble a bit during her Rose Adagio, but her balance was acceptable to me since I sometimes lose my balance just putting on my pants if I'm not leaning against something. Her acting was also very good in the finger pricking scene when she shows her mother the blood and then to her ladies in waiting, who all assure her that she will be alright. Then as she is losing her strength in her final dance she shows everyone again her injury before losing consciousness. Then her mother gives the best performance of a bereaved mother that I have seen in any ""Beauty"" to date. She actually acts like she is afraid her daughter is dying. In all the other versions everyone just stands around looking at her lying there and in some cases, walk away from her, as they chase Carabosse. One of the best things Peter Wright does in this version is to keep Aurora on stage as she enters her hundred years sleep. She SHOULD stay on stage and not carried unceremoniously off stage or worse yet up some winding staircase, not to be seen again for the next hundred years. And, of course, all of her folks should be put to sleep beside her, exactly the way Peter Wright did it. When she is awakened she should be in the same place where she entered her sleep, and in the same clothes. I think it is alright to have her in a more ethereal dress in the vision scene because, she is, after all, a spirit. The interaction between Carabosse her minions and the Prince was good, but all of the power seemed to be in the Lilac Fairy, and not much bravado coming from the Prince.

The last act shows what can happen in a hundred year time period, from candelabras to glittering electric chandeliers, for instance, but the opulence is still there, and the ambiance is still very regal. Of course, there are the typical divertissements of a ""Beauty"" third act with a wonderful Pas de quatre and four beautiful variations, Puss and Boots, Red Riding-hood, an exceptional Blue Bird and Princess Florine and their variations, followed by the bridal couple and their very beautiful Adagio and variations.

The very best ""Sleeping Beauty"" to be had. It is beyond belief that anyone would give this a two star rating. Frankly, I think they need a better display device (TV set) as there are NO dark scenes in this particular DVD.

I will admit, however, that it is a little out of focus especially in the wide shots, but close-ups are beautiful.",1218585600,16,5421,5.325934579439252
8035720,5,B00030EQUC,"Es una obra espectacular. Gran montaje, las ballestistas son excelentes y bellas, vestuario precioso. Las variaciones de las faries y de Aurora son de lo mejor. No te la pierdas!!!!",1189900800,3,181,5.066666666666666
8035721,2,B00030EQUC,"I apologize upfront for the negative review as I usually only rate products that I am enthusiastic about -- the negativity usually reflects merely my personal preference and therefore a negative review may not do justice to the author or artist. But I felt compelled to say a few words about this recording as it is rather overrated. Got this for my ballet-mad daughters for Christmas and we watched it right away. Very disappointing. I chose this production because it was recorded in 2003 and I had hoped for a better quality, at least technically. Well, the lighting was way too dark -- for a good half of the show the screen would be so dark that it was difficult to figure out what's going on. The pace could be a bit more cohesive as well. The choreography was less than captivating. On top of all this, one practical nuisance is that the performance was recorded on two DVDs -- the disc needs to be exchanged after the First Act. It is really not a big deal but it adds to the non-cohesiveness of the whole performance. My 5 year old, who is usually fully absorbed in ballet and musicals and had sat through numerous full length live performance and recordings, also voted against this one just ten minutes into it. Positives: excellent performance of the orchestra and gorgeous costume design.",1104278400,22,1301,4.636363636363637
8035722,5,B00030EQUC,"As soon as I held this dvd in my hands, I knew this was no ordinary edition; it's heavy!  Actually, this edition is TWO dvds.  It also contains a sumptuous booklet in English, French, and German(why no Dutch?).  That's why it is so heavy.  There is also no regional coding, so it should be viewable in ALL regions.  This is a very complete,long Sleeping Beauty.  It is brand new(performed in 2003) and state of the art.  It is a very ambitious and successful production.  The dancing is nearly flawless, especially by Sofiane Sylve.  What an amazing stage presence!  What an amazing dancer, as the New York City Ballet  has discovered, since she now dances for them.  Sadly, this was her farewell performance with the National Ballet of Holland, but she says her heart will always be in Amsterdam.  This should be enough of Sleeping Beauty for anyone.  The playing time, including the interviews, is three hours!  Gael Lambiotte does a great job also as Prince Florimund. This dvd is one of the Ballet greats!",1100736000,31,1009,4.718390804597701
