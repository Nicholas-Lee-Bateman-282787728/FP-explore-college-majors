8671891,4,B00MEXP5S8,"I am a Christmas nut!  I love everything about Christmas, and I really enjoy Christmas movies.  In fact, I collect them.  I reserve five stars for my very favorites.  Christmas at Cadillac Jack's will never be on the same level as some of the classics like ""It's a Wonderful Life"".  However, it is a good movie and is worth watching.  I will watch it again during future Christmas seasons.  If you decide to buy it, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.  It is a story about forgiveness.......something we all need to practice more often.",1423612800,,538,4.418367346938775

I watched this story several years ago and it is still one of my favorite Christmas stories of the modern era. I won't give away the story,but if you want a lovely,soothing,special movie check this one out.",1415750400,,326,4.945454545454545
