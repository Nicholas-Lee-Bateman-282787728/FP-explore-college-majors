8070718,4,B0009Z1AE6,"OK (as spaghetti westerns go) mid-60's, Italian-French made, English-dubbed Euro western.  A former gunman, now a mild-mannered shopkeeper, tries to hide his former identity from townspeople and an invading horde of no-good outlaws.  Not easy when you're trying to defend the town from these slugs.  The Dorado Films DVD is OK quality but it is clear that the film has not been re-mastered and the DVD has no extras save chapter selection.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1431302400,,475,5.051282051282051
8070719,2,B0009Z1AE6,his is quite a rare movie so I was pleased to be able to purchase it. As usual with all this old stuff I (we)live in hopethat the company marketing it has gone to some trouble to remaster the film but why by no means is this the worst I have bought its no where near worthy of spending your money on blurred and often colour dropout you are all aware of this with amlost 90% of what is being marketed out there however rare it is worth buying if you live in the usa where the postage is fair trying the same getting it from accross the water and the disc is the cheapest part of the deal. I plan sometime in the future when I have the time to write a book rating the rubbish that companys expect us to buy  Al Watts Radio presenter Australia,1263427200,,741,4.006756756756757
