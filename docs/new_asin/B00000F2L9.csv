1201227,1,B00000F2L9,"Are people giving this movie good ratings because they think they ought to, or because they honestly find it interestingly done?  I love Bob Dylan and Jeff Bridges and many of the other people involved in this film, but this is easily one of the worst movies that I have ever seen.
A lot of people are going to ""say"" they like this because they will feel their cultural coolness is at risk if they don't.  But most people are going to hate it.  Why?  Because it is just dreadful.",1074988800,17,479,4.288888888888889
1201345,5,B00000F2L9,"Good film. A bit awkward, but in a good way, not unlike Terry Gilliam's best films. Obviously fans of Bob Dylan (particularly of his 90s-present period) will also be interested in this. I loved this film even before I learned that Bob Dylan co-wrote it (under a Russian pseudonym) with the director. It makes sense because it FEELS like the real Bob Dylan, although he's playing a fictional role in a fictional movie. But the movie's a great blend of realism with some slightly surrealistic, puzzling elements--which, again, the filmmaker Terry Gilliam is also good at.

I'm surprised that this film apparently got a lot of bad reviews. Yeah, it features a lot of big-name actors in various medium-sized roles or small cameos, and though that sort of thing CAN be done very badly, it wasn't so in this film.

Personally, I'm a huge Bob Dylan fan, and love his late/current period, and think he's a great bad-ass and all-around artist. This film was another of his countless great achievements. And all of the other actors did great too.

A good political, spiritual film.",1483315200,,1071,4.809782608695652

Finding Gold on The Independent Film Channel

I just saw a film on an a television channel that specializes in Independent, off beat, didn't quite make it films. It was made in 2003 and is called Masked and Anonymous. I'd neither seen nor heard of it. It was directed, produced and written by Larry Charles, who penned the first five seasons of the Seinfield sitcom. Bob Dylan co-authored the script under the pseudonym ""Sergei Petrov."" I have no idea why Dylan, who also was the central character and star, used a pseudonym.

According to Wikipedia the people's encyclopedia, the film was funded by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and filmed in 20 days.

Despite the the obvious low priority and short shooting schedule, here is a partial list some of actors who have commanded millions for roles they've played, who signed on to work for union scale . The current Screen Actor's Guild (SAG) daily rate, is $880; and the weekly rate is $3,280. Here are some you will probably recognize: John Goodman, Jeff Bridges, Penlope Cruz, Val Kilmer, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Lange, Luke Wilson, Angela Bassett, Bruce Dern, Cheech Marin, Ed Harris; Christian Slater and Fred Ward.

Let's face it, the opportunity to work with a living legend like Bob Dylan doesn't come along every day, even for stars to work for what was minimum wage to them, just to be a part of it.

Masked and Anonymous is set in an undated future world in which chaos and a dictatorial, third world type government reign. Dylan plays a washed up but legendary music icon, Jack Fate, who is obviously supposed to be Dylan himself. Fate is the estranged son of the the President/Dictator of the United States is in prison when the film begins.

Fate is sprung from prison by Uncle Sweetheart (John Goodman) -- a shady concert promoter -- to be featured in, a giant charity concert, with which the desperate promoter plans to pay off his own debts. Goodman's character is being pursued by criminal types to whom he owes a lot of money. He. has described the concert as ""something that will be bigger than Woodstock.""

It seems that this film is mostly a platform for Bob Dylan's music, politics and philosophy, and that's all right with me. Not an actor, the former Robert Zimmerman still manages to deliver his lines and voice-overs in an acceptable, though somewhat monotone voice and the actors working for scale seem to try no less harder than if they were starring in a film based on a Nobel Prize winning novel.

Goodman plays as the blowhard con man who will say anything to make the concert a success, is very believable; Val Kilmer gave an exceptional performance as a hippy-like prophet who loves animals and hates people; the always beautiful Jessica Lange, plays an aging former world famous actress, working as a go-between manager is superb as usual -- implementing orders from the unidentified criminal syndicate bosses through Goodmans's character, who must in turn persuade Fate to go along with the orders disguised as ""requests;"" Christian Slater is outstanding as a philosophical stagehand, watching and commenting on the often chaotic situation.

Last but not least, Mickey Rourke Plays, Edmund, a sort of foster brother to Dylan's character, who says to the music legend at one point: ""I'm the man your father always wanted you to be.""

I will not give a way any more of the rice paper thin plot or the ending. As an example of cinematic art, most critics gave it a violent thumbs down, but I'm not a cinematic critic. If you came of age in the sixties, saw Woodstock as an almost religious event -- and especially if you are a Bob Dylan fan -- you need to watch this film. I just ordered it on CD for a few dollars and I generally don't collect films or CDs. It can also be downloaded directly for immediate viewing.

This film is worth seeing, especially if you fit the criteria of an aging Dylan fan who came of age in the 1960s, or a student of the music of that era. Here are a few quotes from Masked and Anonymous:",1438819200,,4073,4.7631205673758865

1201397,5,B00000F2L9,"""Masked & Anonymous"" is a surreal masterpiece written by none other than Bob Dylan himself.  For an independent film obviously made with a minimal budget, it has a DREAM CAST OF A-LIST ACTORS: Bob Dylan, Oscar-winner Jessica Lange, John Goodman, Angela Bassett, Mickey Rourke, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeff Bridges, Val Kilmer, Chris Penn, Christian Slater, Ed Harris.  Jessica Lange is BRILLIANT as always. It's very much worth getting the DVD, because there are in-depth interviews with the cast. Lange and Goodman are just perfect  on-screen together. I hadn't seen them together on screen since 1995's ""A Streetcar Named Desire."" Both actors are simply mesmerizing--what fantastic chemistry they have on screen together! Bob Dylan also turns in an equally brilliant understated performance as ""Jack Fate,"" a singer-songwriter who is let out of prison to perform a ""benefit"" concert for a government-controlled network television special, in a war-torn dictatorship-run country. ""Sometimes it's not enough to know the meaning of things,"" Dylan says in voice-over early in the film. ""Sometimes we have to know what things don't mean as well. . . I stopped trying to figure things out a long time ago."" It's a complex tapestry that reminded me of a 21st century Shakespeare comedy/tragedy/drama all rolled into one. There's a scene where Jessica Lange has one of the best lines of the film. Somebody asks Jessica Lange, ""What are they fighting about?"" Lange says, ""I don't know what they're fighting about...do the Jews, Hindus, Arabs, Muslims, Christians know what they're fighting about? The last person who knew what this war was all about...was killed a long time ago."" She is at the top of her game in ""Masked & Anonymous,"" as is the entire cast. I believe the movie was panned by critics because the film can't be easily categorized or understood. It's deep and fascinating and entertaining. Period.",1431388800,,1898,5.175895765472313

A true labor of love with 22 Dylan songs like you've never heard before!

Bob silently observes until it's time for him to take the stage.  He chooses to do most of his communicating in song.  It would be a huge mistake to expect his bizarre encounters with big actors to somehow make cohesive sense.  They never do.

The performed music is great, the use of the (overly) star-studded cast is hilariously tongue-in cheek, and the plot in no joke.  The movie was filmed in LA, and it's about life under a (future?) totalitarian state.  An intriguing mix.

John Goodman  holds the group of characters together and turns out a concert from an entailed tale of revenge  and political  overthrow.  Dylan as Jake Fate is off the cuff funny and sad. It is his fate that tangles  the web. Good music  score. OF COURSE ...  It is a movie for those with the aquired taste  for  the independent  films.  AND  the Bob Dylan  fan. I needed to see it more that once to appreciate  each character and the story.  And the music is great. Worth buying since you will be hitting play more than once.,1351987200,,581,4.289719626168225
1201478,3,B00000F2L9,"MASKED AND ANONYMOUS is long, often incoherent, open to interpretation, visually over the top and more than a little pretentious. I kind of like it.

I doubt there's much point in debating whether or not this is a masterpiece. Since when has ANYTHING about Bob Dylan been easy to define? What I do find is that it's very much in the spirit of his most allegorical song lyrics from the mid-Sixties, and about as anarchic. If you enjoyed Mr. D during that period in his life, or even some of his post-Sixties music where the songs' meanings were highly subjective, you might well like this movie. Or not...this is a movie, after all, and not an album. But you might be pleasantly surprised by its staying power after you finish watching it. In sum, this movie is worth a second, or third or more time screening it, before deciding whether or not  there is more meat on these bones.",1346457600,,879,4.522012578616352
1201479,3,B00000F2L9,"This is an arty film that falls flat on its face in communicating with the general audience. However, if all you really want is to see and hear Bob Dylan sing and act, in addition to hearing others sing his songs, then you should enjoy it. It plays pretty as did Ben Hecht's arty film when he was not employed only as a writer, Dylan is called upon for a minimum of acting, neatly handled by making him the silent type, his singing  is pretty much representative of his late middle aged style, meaning pretty unintelligible with the voice being used as a musical instrument more than as a device for communicating words. John Goodman makes the most of a decent part, with no one else, no matter how good an actor, given any room for display of these qualities. The setting could be any one a hundred possible sites; frankly, I don't think most watchers will care much. Just think of a dictatorship with a mirror image new government taking power promising nothing better. Apparently BBC was involved in producing this dud; I wonder why.",1323129600,,1036,4.56989247311828

Forget ""Chronicles"". Forget ""No Direction Home"". THIS is Dylan's autobiography! Candid, hilarious at times, and as pointed as it's ever going to get. From Jeff Bridges (as the journalist) asking all the stupid questions Bob's ever been asked to Penelope Cruz understanding that  ""his songs are open to any interpretation"" - it's all you need to know.

And IF they DID, anyone with half-a-brain would run away from them as fast as possible!  The acting ranges from insanely OVER-THE-TOP to lame to amputated - many good-to-great actors say their lines as if each was so gosh-darn PROFOUND or if this were high school and ""M&A"" was their chance to ""shine"" in a 10th grade class play.  The plot/story is heavy-handed satire on, well, stardom and America -- if someone under the age of 16 wrote the script, I'd say it was OK.  As for Dylan's ""acting"" as ""Jack Fate"" (I guess ""Irving Destiny"" was already taken), I've seen CORPSES move more naturally.  The soundtrack is nice, however.  Criswell predicts: In the future where we will spend the rest of our lives, ""M&A"" will be held in the same regard as ""Battlefield Earth,"" ""Heaven's Gate"" (also starring Jeff Bridges!), and ""Pluto Nash.""

1201529,4,B00000F2L9,"Obviously, this movie is not for everyone.  But it DOES have a lot going for it including footage of Dylan performing some otherwise unavailable songs with (arguably) his best band ever, and some very entertaining cameos.  John Goodman and Jeff Bridges are always fun to watch and distract the viewer from Dylan's limited acting abilities.  I won't give a synopsis here -- read some other reviews for that.

The movie gives us a real dark, dystopian view of the future -- fans of Terry Gilliam's films may appreciate this.  Yes, there are messages in the movie about the relationship of the artist to commerce, his role in society, the nature of war, redemption, etc., but I think a lot of people who have reviewed this have just been taking it a little too seriously.  It strikes me as post-apocalyptic vaudville -- entertaining, funny and perhaps with a little something to say, but that's all...

Bob Dylan & Larry Charles wrote the screenplay together - and created a powerful social commentary on where America could be headed.  The primary cast is perfect, plus there are quite a number of short appearances by another group of actors with powerful little scenes.

The central theme is the state of government, the TV network, and a varied & diverse group of stressed individuals who are trying to make their way through a society that has crumbled into half-collapse.

Put Granny & the kids to bed, crank up the surround sound system, and let the movie take you on a wierd, creative, Dylan-esque song experience........on film.

Uncle Sweetheart: [to Jack Fate] You look good. You got the ""jail pale"". It suits you.
======================================

The first time I tried to watch Masked & Anonymous I got to the part where Jack Fate sings for the first time since being released from prison and I couldn't understand a word he was singing. I gave up and went to sleep. The next morning I woke up refreshed and gave it another try. When I heard ""My Back Pages"" performed by Mogokoro Brothers as kind of a hip hop thing done in a foreign language (Spanish?) I knew I was going to enjoy the movie. The sound track is chock full of Bob Dylan songs, done everywhich way, from The Golden Gate Strings, or Percy Faith and his Orchestra, to The Ramones, or Los Lobos. Pulled in by his music, I had no trouble understanding the words of Jack Fate, alias Bob Dylan.

-----------------------------------
Jack Fate: I was always a singer and maybe no more then that. Sometimes it's not enough to know the meaning of things, sometimes we have to know what things don't mean as well. Like what does it mean to not know what the person you love is capable of? Things fall apart, especially all the neat order of rules and laws. The way we look at the world is the way we really are. See it from a fair garden and everything looks cheerful. Climb to a higher plateau and you'll see plunder and murder. Truth and beauty are in the eye of the beholder. I stopped trying to figure everything out a long time ago.
==============================================

The movie takes place in a politically unstable future, like some South American country always on the verge of another coup, another revolution. Jack Fate is in jail, but Nina Veronica (Jessica Lange) and Uncle Sweetheart (John Goodman) have plans to spring him so he can play a big benefit concert. It would mostly benefit them, of course, but The Network is not really aware of just how big a legend Jack Fate is. Still, they can get him cheap, and so the show will go on. Meanwhile journalist Tom Friendly (Jeff Bridges) is assigned to do a story or an interview on the man, and Tom reluctantly brings along his young girlfriend, Pagan Lace Pen&eacute;lope Cruz).

But don't let the plot get in the way of the story, because the movie is really a fable or a metaphor for the career and life of Bob Dylan. How he approached the life of a traveling folk singer as a kind of poet, but then became a prisoner of his own fame. Where his poems came from he didn't know himself, they kind of just went through him. He saw flaming letters and wrote down what they spelled out. People thought he had the answers. They thought he had all the answers and was just sitting on them, like a dragon guarding a decaying horde of gold that wasn't doing anybody any good. Obsessed fans went through his trash and harrassed him because he refused to give them the answers they knew he had stashed away.

------------------
Jack Fate: By the way, which side of the political fence are you on?
Desk Clerk: I do not belong to any political party, sir. I guess you could call me... a feminist
=============================

The movie was written by Bob Dylan and Larry Charles under assumed names, because they were masked and anonymous. Dylan was Sergei Petrov and Charles was Rene Fontaine. Mr. Charles was a writer for Seinfeld and then he had his own show, Curb Your Enthusiasm. Larry Charles directed it, his first feature film, and they knocked it out in 20 days, filming on digital video. A stellar cast worked for much less than usual for the chance to be in a movie with Dylan. They were honored to be included, as well they should.

A high point in the movie is when a very young black woman (Tinashe Kachingwe) sings ""The Times They Are A-Changin'"" Even a tool of a critic who trashed the movie and called it a vanity project was moved by this scene. There are many interesting versions of Dylan's music performed for the soundtrack. Virtually all of the songs were written by him, and he also contributes quite a few performances of his own music. Masked and Anonymous is a great film, but if you don't 'get' Bob Dylan, then you probably will be perplexed by it. Sometimes it's not enough to know the meaning of things, sometimes we have to know what things don't mean as well.

1201535,5,B00000F2L9,"This is rated PG-13, but it's a must for any Dylan fan. From the blurbs and reviews, one can piece together the story, so I won't recount it. It most reminds me of the Sam Shephard (sp.) plays I've seen performed and acted in. There's a bit that seems almost taken from T-Bone Burnett's Truth Decay album, and has the same intonation and delivery. There's a band that includes Charlie Sexton, who joined Dylan's band after recording two Tonio-K songs. Full of rare genius, this film has the usual suspects' fingerprints all over it.

The last three films I watched had John Goodman in them, but here he outdoes himself in a performance that may equal that in O Brother, Where Art Thou? Val Kilmer hints at hidden depths and could have excelled in a wider part. Jeff Bridges as the writer delivers a curiously muted performance. In my view, he simply doesn't have John Goodman's command of language. However, he could be playing The Big Lebowski (sp.), this so easily slips into Coen Bros. /T-Bone Burnett territory. The natural in this film, however, is Jessica Lange. Hers is an Oscar winning performance (if films like this were ever considered for Oscars).

What of Dylan? I most enjoyed watching him perform, and likely don't have the same view of that as some other reviewers. I thought he was rather forced on 'Dixie"" and the other folk songs, mostly because people know how those go and expect a certain sort of rendering. But Dylan's originals are his own. There's a tremendous version of ""I'll Remember You,"" unplugged and far slower than whatever album it appeared on. There's also one verse of ""Blind Willie McTell"", which is on the third disc of Bootleg Series Vol. 1-3. Also in that boxed CD set is a dazzling number called ""Angelina"". An instrumental version of ""Angelina"" plays near the end of the film, but the lyrics are never sung.

I eagerly searched for the CD soundtrack, thinking these songs would be on it, but they're not. Some critics have found this film to be pretentious and self-conscious. I found it anything but. There is some overdubbed talking, apparently in the first person by Dylan persona Jack Fate, which may fall into that category, and there is a Jeff Bridges monologue I would have edited out. Some of the Jack Fate parts sound like they could have been Dylan reading his autobiography. The actual character rarely speaks in the film, and doesn't seem too far removed from the riverboat gambler of Love and Theft. I would have liked T-Bone Burnett to have been in this film, but of course he's busy with his Coen Bros. projects, producing and, I hope, re-releasing Proof Through the Night and Trap Door for those of us who missed the Rhino limited edition release.

The photography is amazing. The iconography seems taken from the cover of the little heard Dylan album, Knocked Out Loaded, which perhaps helped inspire it. Dylan is one of the few performers at home in both French and Spanish culture. He regularly performs at the New Orleans jazz festivals, and is here at home among references to Hemmingway and other expatriates. Finally, the writing in this film is amazing. Where are you going? Jack Fate asks a fellow traveller at a bus stop. ""This way,"" he replies. ""Another good way is that way"" or words to that effect. ""Masked"" captures Dylan in perhaps his most natural persona, and one to which many can relate, that of the wanderer. It walks into serious business indeed, without taking itself too seriously, and proves that art house need not be arty.",1222992000,,3506,4.733224222585925

Writers: Bob Dylan (written by) &
Larry Charles (written by)

I did not know I had this movie. Sorting through old DVDs I found 5 movies starring Penelope Cruz. Then I looked more closely at the cover art - there he was - the living legend - Bob Dylan starring in a movie of his own (directed by Seinfeld director).

That was enough reason for anyone to watch this movie. Dylan starring as Jack Fate - an old forgotten heroic musician lost to the modern era. He is brought back on stage by a hustling friend (Goodman) who is organising a charity where none of the big stars want to play. Damn all LiveAids and the rest. This is in a country unknown with a war not understood at an unspecified year.

Now the fabulous star cast that bring more vigour to the solid presence of Dylan himself:
Bob Dylan ... Jack Fate
Jeff Bridges ... Tom Friend
Penlope Cruz ... Pagan Lace
John Goodman ... Uncle Sweetheart
Jessica Lange ... Nina Veronica
Luke Wilson ... Bobby Cupid
Angela Bassett ... Mistress
Steven Bauer ... Edgar
Michael Paul Chan ... Guard
Bruce Dern ... Editor
Ed Harris ... Oscar Vogel
Val Kilmer ... Animal Wrangler
Cheech Marin ... Prospero
Chris Penn ... Crew Guy #2
Giovanni Ribisi ... Soldier

They all are perfect in their characters.
I didn't recognise Mickey Rourke as the President's son and heir. But I recognised his voice of course - am a fan of that guy or rather the crazy people he plays in his movies.

So you think it is too heavily loaded with superstars to make it work?

Well the question you need to ask is :
Do you love every single Bob Dylan song he has ever written?

Affirmative!

The appeal of the movie is to people to whom his songs speak to. He sings about You, about Everyone. The movie has the same USP. And there are Dylan songs galore here even before they were released in Album format.

When the movie started with the legend's songs being covered by pop/hiphop style versions as background music I must say I was outraged. But these are good cover versions. And then of course Jack Fate (Dylan) is recruited to do the charity gig and he sings.........

Live Dylan and there are other beauties. Jessica as the stressed out media exec and Penelope as Jeff Bridges' Jesus fearing lady.

Incredible movie magic as Dylan kicks Jeff Bridges' a$$ to protect the hustler friend. Dylan floors him easily and the climax makes you ponder the futility of all Life everywhere.

There are incredible monologues in this movie. The one by Val Kilmer is an acting lesson and work of genius.

Then those by Dylan and then him reminiscing the horrible past and dead present.

Then there is that weird radio Jessica listens to which gives out News about discovering things at the Earth's crust and how hollow Earth's soul really is.

Yes Philosophy or Abstract Art - whatever you call it - its mesmerising and captivating.

The guest appearances by some of the well known actors are very fun...and the rolls they play make you sit back and think...what the hell? Which is totally Dylan, and totally fun. Everytime I watch the film, I pick up on something, or some little spoken ditty that I missed before.",1207526400,,449,4.69620253164557
1201538,3,B00000F2L9,"Bob Dylan, Jeff Bridges, Penelope Cruz, John Goodman, Jessica Lange, Luke Wilson, Angela Bassett, Bruce Dern, Ed Harris, Val Kilmer, Cheech Marin, Chris Penn, Giovanni Ribisi, Christian Slater - among others.  With a blockbuster cast like that it's got to be good, right?  Wrong.  This movie is, to paraphrase Churchill's description of Russia, a train wreck wrapped inside a catastrophe.  The fun is seeing all those stars.  The regret is seeing all that talent squandered.  It's like one of those dreadful Altman movies where you spend all your time going, ""Oh my God, that's xyz,"" because actors love him so much they're willing to play hotel clerks, meter maids, and lavatory attendants. The same force is at work here.  Dylan has so much juice that terrific actors jumped at the opportunity to work for peanuts and failed to notice that the concept, script, and direction were staggeringly awful.

This said, there are moments, and appropriately enough, they are always isolated.  If you enjoy painfully self-conscious, intentionally murky art house soliloquies, meaningless twaddle disguised as deeply poetic reasoning - and who doesn't? - you'll be pleased.  Ribisi, as a soldier who changes sides as often as you or I might change clothes, delivers the best one, followed by Kilmer who has a Walken-esque gift for deranged, disturbing characters.  Bridges is convincing as a nihilistic, alcoholic journalist whose abrasive, narcissistic pursuit of Dylan must have been very amusing to these insiders, accustomed as they are to fleeing from this type.  The absolute lack of plot and character provided some participants with motivation to act, presumably in hopes of causing something to happen.  In addition to Bridges, Goodman and Lange give it the old school try.  By contrast, Dylan seems to be sleepwalking through the entire effort, expressing absolutely no emotional range whatsoever.  Perhaps, since everyone else can do a good Bob Dylan impression, he didn't feel the need to do a good one himself.

Larry Charles shoulders the directorial shame, and shares the writing shame with Dylan.  A generous soul might say that some of the alleged third world footage (actually L.A.) shares the same stream of conscious feeling one gets from Dylan's better songs, jarring imagery, disjointed, haunting thoughts.  A generous soul might say that the twin themes of social revolution and musical posturing manipulated by the media says a great deal about where pop culture stands today as opposed to where it stood when we all believed that the times really were a changing.  A generous soul might.  But that generous soul ain't me.  Babe.",1195430400,2,2644,5.174117647058823

1201562,3,B00000F2L9,"Masked & Anonymous is a silly vanity project, pure and simple.

No, your enjoyment of the film is not the ultimate litmus test of your Bob Dylan fanhood.  On the other hand, do not attempt to find anything redeeming about the film if you aren't at least a casual admirer of Bob Dylan.

The plot is simple and cameos abound.  Folk singer Jack Fate (Bob Dylan) is busted out of prison by manager (John Goodman) so he can perform a benefit concert that may re-unite his unnamed civil war-torn home country.  Cameo highlights include Jeff Bridges as an overzealous Lebowski Dude-like reporter, Luke Wilson as a fellow musician, Val Kilmer as a prophet of sorts, and the always enjoyable Cheech Marin.

Bob Dylan is a flat, frail actor.  I suspect his stony silence was supposed to belie some inner tortured musician nature, but he just comes off as a cardboard cut-out.  Watching this movie, I was struck by the similarities to Poison lead singer Bret Michaels's vanity film about a felonious bad boy with a heart of gold (Letter from Death Row).  Both movies have fantastic musicians proving that they can't act, their script-writing abilities are absurd, and their music is far superior in the context of an album than as a concept piece for a movie.  Both movies abound with stereotypical characters who serve only to parody themselves.

This is not to say there aren't funny moments, or that none of the actors shine.  It's an overblown project full of pseudo-meaning, but there are moments of genius scattered about, and some excellent performances by Bob Dylan and other musicians.",1179014400,2,1583,4.822222222222222

1201565,2,B00000F2L9,"I purchased this DVD with my eyes wide open, because I had been forwarned by reviewers I respect, and I still place Dylan's 1977 ""Renaldo and Clara"" near the top of my most pretentiuos doo doo list. But wait, that was almost 30 years ago and this movie stars Jeff Bridges AND John Goodman (the Dude abides), also Jessica Lange, Giovanni Ribisi, Val Kilmer, Bruce Dern, Mickey Rourke and was co-written and directed by Larry Charles of Seinfeld and Friends fame, so how bad could it be?
Well I planned on watching it one night but after about 30 minutes became fatiqued and fell asleep. This went on for about 3 more nights until I finally finished the movie. The week before I had watched the uncut ""Heaven's Gate"" (nearly 4 hours), a deliberate slowly paced film, in one sitting, and yet ""M and A"" seemed so much longer. I also skipped watching the few deleted scenes (something I can't remember ever doing), and went straight for the ""Making Of"" and watched and listened to those involved talking about the great script and a movie I can't remember seeing.
I realize now that deleted scenes would be overkill since the entire movie seems like it's just a bunch of strung together deleted scenes. This is not to say the movie is unwatchable, I had kept coming back to it night after night, in fact there are some very entertaining and surreal moments in the film, I just wish there had been more of them. For starters I would have liked to have seen more of Ribisi, for he was the most focused in his part (though it also seemed like he was in another movie), they could have beefed up the Christian Slater-Chris Penn bits or even made them the main characters and created a sort of Abbott and Costello Meet Jack Fate. Val Kilmer was great, but he disappeared too soon, and some of the songs Dylan did with his band were pretty good, but they could have given the young girl (Tinashe Kachingwe), who stole the show singing ""The Times They Are A-Changin'"", more of Dylan's songs to sing.
The best part of the film for me was Jeff Bridges as a Dudesque reporter asking Dylan's Jack Fate lots of bizarre questions, in fact a short that just edited together all these bits would be enjoyable.
I guess that's most of the good stuff, but on the other hand, I wish they had removed the entire subplot concerning his dying father (Richard Sarafian) Angela Bassett, and Mickey Rourke, and despite old man makeup, his father still looks younger than Bob (things must have been pretty bad in prison).
Less of Lange and Goodman would have made it less irratating, and Luke Wilson and particularly Penelope Cruz should have ended up on the cuttingroom floor. I'm not sure what to make of Ed Harris in black-face except that I felt like he was a refugee from some old Fellini film.
Bob Dylan acts like he sings which isn't so bad in a film where  many of the other actors are so over-the-top, and watching him is like looking at an abstract painting, it doesn't ever change but you keep looking at it to try and find some inner meaning.
This is Larry Charles first film and judging by his TV work you would have expected it to be at least funny, but where ""Seinfeld"" was supposed to be a TV show about nothing but was actually about alot, this movie really is about nothing.",1144454400,12,3261,4.480672268907563

Listen to Bob's albums, but stay far away from this movie.  So many great actors, but the story is nonsense.  The characters are just a random assortment of stereotypes.  Unnatural dialogue.  Poorly lit.  Poorly directed.  Poorly edited.

And Bob couldn't act his way out of a paper bag.  Stone-faced, frail, semi-catatonic; completely devoid of charisma.  It's his vanity project, but he comes off looking ridiculous.  Even his musical performances are only so-so.

The movie was shot entirely inside a Hollywood studio (except for a few 2nd unit shots of downtown LA), making it look fake and crowded.

I think this whole movie is more about experience than story. It is profane and divine, clear eyed and full of poo, full of wrath and compassion, funny and tragic, artful and artless, a confusing mess -- sorta like life.

The surprising thing about this film is how good it is.  Clearly experimental in form (which often equals boring) Masked and Anonymous is instead a fascinating work of art with outstanding performances amid a meandering chaos replete with cunning little speeches that defy analysis.  I was not really surprised to learn that credited screenwriter ""Sergei Petrov"" is really Bob Dylan.  Kudos to him and to ""Rene Fontaine"" (actually Larry Charles of ""Seinfeld"" fame) for coming up with this little gem.

However I have to say that without Dylan's music and the fine cast this could have been an unmitigated disaster.

One of the things I love about Bob Dylan is the intensity.  It's always there.  He never stops.  It's as though the next lyric will be the line to end all lines (pun intended) or that the next musical hook will exhaust the music.

Like Emily Dickinson he invented a new kind of poetry that confounded the poetic establishment and confused academia.  When I first heard Dylan's lyrics in the sixties referred to as poetry, I was an undergraduate at UCLA and thought (apparently along with Carl Sandburg): this ain't poetry.  It's all cliches.  And it is.  But what Bob Dylan did was to use the phrases and the cliches and the rhythms of our world as the poet uses words.  The cliches became the building blocks of his poems.  And of course they filled his head to overflowing, echoing and ricocheting around in his mind like the wares of Quinn the Eskimo running all around his brain.  And they had to get out, and he tossed them out with tune after tune and a lyric to string them together, and he ended up writing some of best poetry of the latter half of the 20th century.  But of course his poetry, like that of all song writers does not stand entirely alone without its music.  Still his phrases that look into our soul and chronicle our times are as indelible as the color of our skin.  It is no coincidence that in the age of the soundbite, Dylan wrote his poems in soundbites.

Like the 19th century academics who wanted to edit Emily Dickinson's poetry and improve her meter and adjust her ""imperfect"" (slant) rhymes and normalize her punctuation, the academic world of the 20th century wanted to get Dylan to eschew cliche.  But what they missed is the poet knows the language better than they and his cliches are in the modules of our minds.  They are the wings of the zeitgeist and the linguist's meme.

Goodman was perfect as Uncle Sweetheart who might be a deeply buried persona of Dylan with his cryptic one-liners and his desolation soul, his corrupted heart and his huge appetite for life.  And Jessica Lange was also excellent as were the cameos by all sorts of name actors appearing on stage to confront a stoic Dylan.  In a way they were intriguing and perhaps nothing more than that.  Like Shakespearean players they came and had their time upon the stage and were heard no more.

Yes, this film seems to signify in the final analysis not much, but, isn't that the point of life: there is no point.  Life is that tale by an idiot signifying nothing.

Here's a nice string of quotes from the cynic, Jack Fate, Dylan's alter ego: ""I was always a singer and maybe no more than that. Sometimes it's not enough to know the meaning of things, sometimes we have to know what things don't mean as well...Things fall apart...The way we look at the world is what we really are. See it from a fair garden and everything looks cheerful. Climb to a higher plateau and you'll see plunder and murder. Truth and beauty are in the eye of the beholder...I don't pay much attention to my dreams...I stopped trying to figure everything out a long time ago...""

I have only one criticism of this film: I wish there had been a lot more of the hauntingly beautiful Penelope Cruz.",1137369600,3,4011,4.580645161290323
1201593,2,B00000F2L9,"Yes, I admit sometimes musicians make good movies. The Beatles did in `A Hard Days Night' back in the 60s, and I like `Help!' as well. But it is also true that charismatic as they are, they also made mistakes in, say, `Magical Mystery Tour.' And Paul McCartney did another again in `Give My Regards to Broad Street'

But the music is always great, even though the film lacks the brilliance of the music. The same thing can be said about `Masked and Anonymous' in which Bob Dylan appears as `Jack Fate,' a musician who is asked to do a benefit concert in the disordered country, held by an unscrupulous promoter John Goodman. Recently released from the prison, Jack joins in the band and plays songs before us ... before the revolution interrupts.

But before that concert, Jack meets many people - his friend Luke Wilson, rock journalist Jeff Bridges, his love Penelope Cruz, soldier in a bus Giovanni Ribisi, Editor Bruce Dern, Crew # 1 Christian Slater, Crew #2 Chris Penn, Animal Wrangler Val Kilmer, and Oscar winner Jessica Lange. Plus, Cheech Marin, Steven Bauer, Mickey Rourke, Richard Sarafian, Susan Tyrrell, Tracy Walter, Fred Ward, Robert Wisdom and unrecognizable Ed Harris. All of them must have gathered here because of one person Bob Dylan. And Dylan's status in the music history well-deserves it.

But the film itself (written by Dylan and director Larry Charles under assumed names) need more polishing, or at least a point to make. I don't complain if Dylan cannot act - after all he is playing himself. But if you make a film with this cast, whose job here is to act, you need to make it coherent. One example would do. In the film, Dylan's character Jack Fate is often regarded as `nobody' - a has-been who can no longer draw audience as John Goodman repeatedly insists. But we know the truths. We know Dylan is admired by the musicians all over the world (and that's why Goodman is here). And the live sections of the film prove that he is as cool as ever as musician, if not as actor. We enjoy his singing while the characters do not seem impressed. Real professionals like Goodman, Bridges, and Lange do their best to cover the gaps with strong acting, but they are too big to be ignored.

I understand the enthusiastic response from Dylan's fans. For all the undeniable energy in the live performance sections (which are mercilessly cut by editing), however, the film is incomprehensive throughout. It's a chaos, and this chaos has no energy that chaotic things are often endowed with. The humor is too feeble (including the references to music history, like the promoter asking Jack to sing a Beatle song), but the most misguided part is its too philosophical speeches that the characters make. Dylan's enigmatic lyrics work in his songs, but not in dialogues or monologues of a film. `Masked and Anonymous' is a curio at best, which is accompanied by the great soundtrack.",1134345600,4,2899,4.734653465346534

John Goodman is always worth watching-i am yet to see him play a bad role on the large screen. His opening scene is a classic with the black heavies. The Val Kilmer character is in the film for no exact reason-sure the whole scene could be deleted if you wanted to be like that but the conversation he has with ""Jack Fate"" is fantastic.

1201596,4,B00000F2L9,"Director Larry Charles works a lot on HBO producing and writing comedy. This film was a pet project for him, and somehow he recruited a plethora of excellent people to be involved in what became a clunky movie. It is a very dark Sci-Fi/Musical/Adventure/Comedy. It is part political allegory, and part fairy tale--with a healthy dash of rock video for zest.

Bob Dylan is the pivotal character, and gets the most screen time. I can't get over how much he is looking like a short Vincent Price these days, what with his thin haggard face and pencil thin goatee. Dylan is getting a lot of press these days, since Martin Scorsese released the new documentary on him--shown first on PBS, and released immediately in DVD.

The world of the near distant future seems to be a mess--rife with revolution and anarchy. The president of the US, who looks like a Central American dictator reject, is dying of a social disease secondary to his pedophilia. Bob Dylan is supposed to be his prodigal son--who once had a career as protest rock star (some stretch for Dylan), and who has been cooling his heels in a filthy prison as a political prisoner.

The film swarms with big stars doing cameos and small roles. It is the kind of independent small film that might have been a real classic, but has ended up a poorly edited mish-mash. Yet, having said that, I wouldn't be surprised if some day it reached a kind of cult status for its use of Bob Dylan and all those stars--kind of a grand and noble close call to greatness--a film almost impossible to fully comprehend--a plot almost too silly to reflect. Yet a movie that stays with you, irritating your intellect.

John Goodman rants and raves as a sleezy con man promoter. Jessica Lange looks great as his producer partner, although her dialogue makes very little sense. Giovanni Ribissi had a nice scene as a burned out freedom fighter. Jeff Bridges plays a burned out alcoholic reporter, who carries a gun, and gets beat up a lot--after spouting divers non-sequiters and poetry. Penelope Cruz wanders about lost as his religious zealot, ex-whore girlfriend--crossing herself hundreds of times just prior to and following all the scenes she is in. Mickey Rourke plays a gangster White House Chief of Staff, who takes over the country once the President dies. He is supposed to be a childhood friend of Dylan's--a foundling that El Presidente raised and kept beside him. Christian Slater and Chris Penn play philosophizing stage hands who do a poor imitation of a Greek Chorus--and mostly stand around with their arms crossed, looking perplexed.

But Bob Dylan is the focus--if there is one. He and his band perform 8 or 10 songs, and it is fun to watch him and listen to him--although he mumbles so much half of the lyrics are lost--even to the engineers who struggled to make them audible. This film will entertain you, and perplex you. I liked it, even though it played out like a rough cut, and the religious existential apocalyptic images do not mesh well. Give it a look for yourself.",1130284800,3,3029,4.718336483931947
1201597,5,B00000F2L9,"When I was growing up, Dylan was one of the best there was. He is still one of the best, only he is more in the back ground and people do not recognize him as much as they did. His music has always had a message and was not just some bubble gum popping stuff. It is nice to see that he is still around and where he is at at this point in his life. He is a lot better singer than he is actor, but that is because you can tell, he has spent a lot of his life on the stage singing. But it does not look like he has done much acting in comparison. Still, this movie gives us a little bit of insight into who he is and what he is all about. It is a little bit hard to follow, but there is a commentary to help you to figure it out. Or at least so you know what they were thinking, when they produced it.",1130198400,2,798,3.645348837209302
1201598,3,B00000F2L9,"Storytelling is elementary.  You introduce characters and their parts in the story.  Trite and overdone plot elements cried out for the need to approach these story elements from new directions and many of the greatest directors have met that challenge by creating new concepts to the art.  But in the end the audience has to get it somehow, even if, as in the case of some of the more bizarre directors' visions, the point is that there is no point.

  My least favorite type of film director is the one who doesn't have the skills to back up his convictions.  Larry Charles wants to be innovative and different but at the same time he wants this film to look professional.  Hollywood has great stars who can act, so Mr. Charles got great stars who can act.  Hollywood cannot have a musical performance in a film without impatiently interrupting it by cutting to main characters and their seemingly crucial incessant dialogue.  So Mr. Charles cannot allow his character, Jack Fate (Dylan) to complete a performance without jumping right in to more of his disconnected plot.

  In all of the arts, including film making, the weakest work is the one that cannot stand on its own and needs the `big explanation' to justify its survival as art.  This is sloppy art because it makes the audience work for their entertainment which is antithetical and compromising to the viewer.  `Masked and Anonymous' is such a work.  Many of the characters names and purposes are hidden either in the film somewhere or in the DVD chapter titles.  Some complain that they don't understand what was going on in the movie but this is because they didn't know that they have to dig a little for the plot.

  For example, at one point the movie abruptly introduces a character played by Jeff Bridges (if you look at the DVD chapter title you will discover his name is Tom Friend).  He comes into an office but you don't know of what type and only through the dialogue with his boss do you discover it is a newspaper office.  In most movies you would know this immediately.

Tom Friend:  So, what's this all about?  I got my awards. I got my scars. I got nothing to prove to you.

Newspaper Editor:  The rebels are broadcasting a benefit concert for medical relief.  But the government controls the network.  I just want to make sure that its not a P.R. thing, that they're not trying to make themselves look compassionate, or that its not some kind of a set-up or a nefarious ploy to weed out the rebels.  But I will tell you this, there is a story there.  ...There's something else.  There's only one performer, Jack Fate!  You don't need more than that performer.",1129939200,2,2642,4.600858369098712

The movie was not intended to be a huge commercial success, just as he never wrote a song intending it to be a huge commercial success.

Keep in mind Dylan has received two honorary PhD's including one from Princeton.  He has also been nominated many times for the Nobel Prize in Literature and Poetry.  If you want lighthearted top 40 tunes or cookie cutter box office success movies, look elsewhere.

From Shakespeare to Tennessee Williams to Wes Anderson, artists writing for visual adaptation must all posses their own sense of ""song writing."" Bob Dylan is a masterful musician who speaks with such soul, depth, and rhythm that he has become a legend. Surrounded with mystery, the man has an almost religious following (don't believe me? Just take a look at all the big name actors that lined up just to work with him in this one). Masked and Anonymous captures the soul of Dylan with its cryptic poeticism, and distinct political messages. Add to the mix the real Dylan and six original songs debuted in the film, and you have created a cinematic world like none you have seen before.

Most critics bashed the movie, calling it brainless and empty - a sort of masturbation act for Dylan and the actors who blindly signed up to work in a ""Dylan Movie."" I don't care. Masked and Anonymous had me from its opening frames.

Bob Dylan is an American Icon, a man whose music has interpreted much of the milieu of the 20th century in America, and the times they are a changing.  Dylan wrote the script for this venture (with director Larry Charles whose credits include Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm etc) and the film is very much like a Dylan song: there are repeated phrases drawn from the gut-level of language and reaction to events, phrases that don't necessarily make a lot of sense taken out of context, and a lot of band covered vocalism that just seems to add atmosphere for the heck of it.

That is the manner in which this film reflects Dadaism and Nihilism and as such it truly is an art film.  The story is meager: corrupt show people try to hold a fundraising concert for the corrupt government that is being overthrown by revolutionaries and counterrevolutionaries and the only Big Star they can hire is the jailed Jack Fate (Bob Dylan) who is less than the desired Hollywood extravaganza desired.  The writing on the signs in the town of unknown origin are in every language and the characters who are in charge of the show and who are the populace of this oddly demented, strife ridden, war zone city are of every ethnic group imaginable.  In other words, this 'political upheaval' place could be in Africa, Latin America, Middle East, Asia, ? the USA? - it is just somewhere (or everywhere!).

The film is obviously a work of love as it has the largest cast of fine actors even in the bit parts: Bob Dylan, John Goodman, Jessica Lange, Luke Wilson, Christian Slater, Val Kilmer, Mickey Rourke, Penelope Cruz, Giovanni Ribisi, Ed Harris, Angela Bassett, Cheech Marin, Steve Bauer, Bruce Dern, Michael Paul Chan - and others.  The sets are obviously sets, the scenes seem like they had no rehearsal, the acting is intentionally crude, and the action simply is decor for some renderings of Dylan's songs.  It is looney, weird, funny, puzzling, ridiculous, overlong, and altogether a tribute to the genius of Bob Dylan - and a frightening anti-political statement about where we are right now, right here.

Tune in and turn on and adjust your head controls for a wild ride that has a lot to say because it makes you think - and then questions the very process of intellectualizing the whole affair!

The negative criticisms of the film I've seen all seem to be informed by a lack of any substantial understanding of Dylan and an expectation of the usual.  This is art, not a commercial.

1201678,4,B00000F2L9,"It would be almost cliche' at this point to liken ""Masked and Anonymous"" to one of Dylan's epic songs, since every other reviewer who has seen it has done so. But they're right, and if you're a Dylan fan, you'll appreciate the film so much more for just that reason.

""Masked and Anonymous"" encompasses just about every theme we've heard Dylan deal with in his music for the past forty years - religion, corruption, oppression, injustice, love and, finally, redemption.  Dylan, through the character of Jack Fate, portrays an image of himself that is familiar from his songs - at times in the film, he's the Jokerman, other times the Jack of Hearts.  These are, of course, my own interpretations - you'll certainly have your own once you've seen this film as it's wide open to a million different interpretations.

The performances in this picture should not be overlooked either. The lead performances as well as cameos from a dozen or so A-list Hollywood actors are top-notch.  Among these, Jeff Bridges as Tom Friendly, the cynical journalist, stands out as exceptional - oscar-worthy in my humble opinion - but since when does the academy give awards to the films and actors that really deserve to win??

But I digress ... Dylan is obviously the weakest actor in the film, but more than makes up for it with his powerful presence.  In certain instances, as he recites lines like, ""I don't pay any attention to my dreams"" or ""You've got to be born on my side, Sweetheart,"" he even upstages his very talented co-stars.

And, of course, the music.  The film is packed with interpretations of Dylan's own songs, including foreign language translations of ""Like a Rolling Stone"" and ""If You See Her, Say Hello"".  I was personally thrilled to hear ""Blind Willie McTell"" in the soundtrack, though it didn't particularly seem to fit the scene.  And the instrumental version of ""Angelina"" over the film's final scene gave me a chill.

The bottom line is if you're a Dylan fan, as I am, you'll love this picture as a huge addition to Dylan's already legendary body of work.",1093478400,12,2067,4.759103641456583
1201679,3,B00000F2L9,"So I was watching this very late and got to the point where Ed Harris appears in blackface as a banjo-toting ghost, and I said, ""Okay--enough for tonight."" Next day, it had gone back to the video store. ""You didn't want to watch the rest of that thing, did you?""

Well yeah, I did. Not because I was particularly impressed or that it was in any way outstanding, but because my interest was held in spite of all that. ""Masked and Anonymous"" is something you don't often see these days, the kind of let's-turn-on-the-camera-and see-what-happens flick they stopped making around '72, for good reasons. (Anyone who has seen ""Steelyard Blues"" or ""Brewster McCloud"" knows exactly what I mean.) M&A is not going to revive the genre. It features most of the type's drawbacks--a perfunctory story that basically serves as a framework for various odd, disconnected events. Dismal camerawork, cinematography, and technical aspects done with that ""throw out the rulebook' feel that's always marked this kind of film. (""I mean, Dylan did it  that way back in the '60s, right?"" Yeah, but Dylan replaced it with genius, and that was R&R.)

The acting is almost uniformly awful. The cast evidently took this as being on the order of a John Waters film and proceeded accordingly. M&A features THE worst Jeff Bridges performance.  Lange spends the time channeling Cruella de Ville. Goodman carries most of the weight with much of his usual charm, but he seems tired at times. Not even the dependable Fred Ward comes out unscathed, managing to screw up a turn as an obnoxious drunk.

Exceptions include Basset, as adorable as ever, Luke Wilson, who doesn't have much to do, and Val Kilmer, who excels as a kind of postmodern Jeremiah. But I would have guessed he'd do that.

The difference, of course, lies with Dylan. No, he can't act, but that doesn't matter. All he does is walk around looking enigmatic and uttering oracular phrases, but that's Bob Dylan as he's been since 1961, and that's what you came to see. And it works, as it always has, even if he does look like Vincent Price after a rough night in the graveyard. When he's onscreen, your eye is glued to him, and nothing else registers. There are few at any given time who have that kind of presence. The rest of the cast may well have been aware of it, and simply decided not to compete. DeNiro might have been able to keep up, but he'd not in this one. (Bob has a couple good lines too, as in the beginning where somebody reports two eagles killing a rabbit. ""Rabbit must have done something,"" Bob says.)

So for the moment, it's a three-and-a-half. But I will catch up with rest of it one of these days. I mean, where else can you see Ed Harris doing an Al Jolson schtick?",1092873600,10,2720,4.619047619047619
1201680,5,B00000F2L9,"I watched this film probably six times before I arrived at a decision. I knew the first time, that I liked the movie, but I didn't know what the heck happened.

If you're a Bob Dylan fan, and you KNOW his lyrics, you're going to love the film. Bob isn't an actor; he's a poet and a great singer. Get over that. Nobody liked his voice the first time they heard it, but they came around when they realized they agreed with the things he said. Well, give him another chance and stick around to agree with the things that are said here.

The plot is mildly confusing the first couple of times. There's some unexplained war going on and not until you realize that the fact you don't know why there's a war, is a powerful statement, will you be able to overcome that step of the plot. It's an anonymous war, people are fighting and dying and nobody knows why. There's a line in the film, early on, where a character says ""The last person that knew what they were fighting for died long ago.""

This is like a two hour version of one of bob's better songs.

How many times do you listen to a song before you realize you've gone and fallen in love? If you watch this movie once and toss it aside, you need to suck it up and watch it like a poetic piece of art not like a Saturday night movie at home.

And the cinematography, breathtakingly beautiful. Stunning, dramatic and powerful stuff here with camera angles and lighting and just... everything.

And talk about an all star cast, not since Basquiat have I been so pleasantly surprised by familiar faces and wonderful performances.

Ed Harris, Giovanni Ribisi, John Goodman, Luke Wilson, Jeff Bridges, Christian Slater, Angela Bassett, Jessica Lange, Penelope Cruz, Mickey Rourke, just to name a few!!

To top it all off there are about five or six full length Bob Dylan songs to be heard.

1201681,1,B00000F2L9,"Did you people below me on this list of reviews watch the same movie I did?

 I'm a huge Dylan fan, but I also know that Bob Dylan has never used film to his advantage, which explains why he's never made all that many movies.

 This thing is AWFUL. And it's awful pretty much for all the reasons that it's being praised here. Everything everybody says is the movie is supposed to be PROFOUND.

 Nobody can just say, ""Hey, Jack, how you doin'?"" ""Fine. You?"" No, the answer to that question would be a 30-second philosophical rant that sounds like Dylan pulled it out of a file cabinet called ""profound statements I haven't used yet,"" and put it in the script just to get rid of it.

 What's really sad is that this all-star cast is here simply to work with Bob Dylan. It's like if JESUS ever made a movie. It could suck big time but who wouldn't want to be in it?

 So we get cameos by everybody from Christian Slater to Bruce Dern to Val Kilmer (to his credit, Kilmer has ""creepy"" down to a science), Cheech Marin (who actually looks EMBARRASSED to be saying his lines) and the list goes on and on.

 The direction is horrible. John Goodman's unsavory character appears at times to be using the wrong emotions in certain scenes. There are times when it looks like Goodman has simply given up; he just wants to go home.

 Oh, I haven't mentioned the plot yet, not that it matters: Dylan plays Jack Fate, a Bob Dylan character who also happens to be the half-Hispanic, half-white son of the President of North America, an Hispanic fella who apparently took over the hemisphere in a coup, and looks (even on his deathbed) about 20 years younger than Dylan.

 Dylan, of course, is the prodigal son who is in jail until he's sprung free in order to play a benefit concert for...something.

 We never really figure out what, although several ideas are thrown at us.

 On the upside, Dylan performs rather decent versions of five or six songs, most of them his, and there's a cute little girl who sings a perfunctory version of ""The Times They Are A-Changing,"" for no apparent reason.

 Oh, and you do get to see Dylan help beat the tar out of Jeff Bridges, which is always nice.

 ""Masked and Anonymous"" is a truly jaw-dropping experience. I'm glad I rented it, because I most certainly won't be buying it.",1091750400,20,2300,4.447368421052632
1201682,5,B00000F2L9,"This is the first review I've written on this site. Cool.

 I remember walking into the video store and asking for this movie. The owner gave me a quizzical look, like ""Why is a 20 year old college student asking for a movie with a 63 y/o folk singer in it?"" Thus is the question of most of my generation, who are into Britney Spears, Snoop Dogg, etc.

 This movie is really, really good. I think the critics slammed it because they didn't take the time to try and understand the movie. One of the complaints made was ""Bob Dylan is even more enigmatic now that before the movie started."" Well...duh! That's Bob Dylan. He makes you think.

 I believe that each of the characters represents an aspect of humanity. Uncle Sweetheart represents the lifelong lust for material wealth; Veronica represents impatience and overt criticism; Bobby Cupid represents introspection and questions; and Jack Fate is a man that has spent his entire life trying to figure out why people and life are the way they are, and has stopped trying to figure it all out.

 The film features excellent performances by Dylan, though only a couple (""I'll Remember You"" and ""Dixie"") are played in their entirety. According to Larry Charles, the others were cut short for time's sake.

 This film is much better than the soundtrack, btw. Hope this helps. :-)",1090713600,6,1327,4.705627705627705

I saw this at the video store, thought I'd give it a shot. Lots of famous folks, to round off a great cast of support.
From the beginning you can tell the script is pulled from almost every Dylan song imaginable. So it's more of a film then a movie.
My question is: Are all these actors acting so horrible to make Bob look good? Please don't anyone say he's a great actor?
It is a fun movie to watch, again someday.
Dylan play's some traditional music that sets the movie up a few notches.

You don't have to ""get"" Dylan in the first place to appreciate this movie, but it helps a lot.  It is good for the same reasons Dylan's songs are; but you need a lot fewer fans to make a successful record than to make a successful movie.  A million CDs sold is quite a success; a million tickets sold for a Hollywood film is a miserable failure.

The music is great, the acting is excellent, and the scenery and stock footage paint fascinating pictures; and the plot, while minimal, is quite enough to make the movie work.  On its own terms, a big success; ignore the bad reviews and watch with an open mind.",1085184000,3,693,4.259541984732825
1201705,4,B00000F2L9,"Bob Dylan fans will love this surrealistic film, starring Bob Dylan, co-written by Bob Dylan (apparently under the pseudonym of ""Rene Fontaine""), about Bob Dylan, with an extraordinary supporting cast of Hollywood royalty who all seem to revere Bob Dylan. It seems like everybody who is anybody in tinsel town, with an appropriately reverent attitude toward ""Mr. Tambourine Man,"" wanted to be in the movie and act with the maestro. The ""anybodys"" in the cast include: John Goodman, Jessica Lange, Jeff Bridges as a bizarre reporter who grills interview subjects, Pen&eacute;lope Cruz as his supremely neurotic girlfriend with a 333 tattoo and an Incan wardrobe, Luke Wilson in snakeskin, Angela Bassett, Chris Penn, Christian Slater, Mickey Rourke, Ed Harris, Val Kilmer - very funny as a rabid animal activist, Bruce Dern, Cheech Marin, Giovanni Ribisi, and Fred Ward - Dylan groupies all. Larry Charles directed ""Masked and Anonymous."" He is an acclaimed television writer for Seinfeld and HBO's ""Curb Your Enthusiasm."" The movie is set in an unnamed third world country post disastrous counterrevolution...or, it could be the US turned third world country because of a disastrous counterrevolution. Dylan's song, ""Desolation Row,"" was probably consulted and studied before the set designer went to work.
Music impresario Uncle Sweetheart, played by a sleazy John Goodman, decides to host a musical benefit for the children made miserable by the country's upheavals. He and his blowzy producer, (Jessica Lange), are unable to get any of their A-List performers to star. Paul McCartney, Springsteen, Billy Joel all just say ""no."" The only available musician willing to perform is Jack Fate, (played by guess who?), who has to be sprung from jail before he can show up. There is an underlying story about a despicable, dying dictator who looks just like Saddam Hussein, (Richard Sarafian), and could be Jack Fate's father. It really doesn't matter who he is, though, in the general scheme of things. If you like Bob Dylan, you won't mind the laid-back air of confusion surrounding whatever plot there is. Just go with the flow - a very 60s thing to do.
Much of the film's dialogue seems to come from Dylan's songs, some in-jokes that older fans, born before the 1960s, will undoubtedly understand, (I sure did), and wry commentary about almost everything. Some of the dialogue is quite funny. What isn't funny, however, are all the obviously aging stars - who share approximate birth dates with me. The aging process leave no one untouched. Mr. Dylan is totally deadpan, as usual. Has anyone ever seen him smile? It is difficult to understand much of what he says - but hey, I'm a Dylan fan, Bigtime! So, while I may feign a bit of disrespect and sarcasm, I was thrilled to see my favorite super-charismatic, anti-hero and musical genius on the big screen. He makes amazing music - still. His back-up is excellent. He performs six songs on camera, four of his own and two standards, ""Diamond Joe"" and ""Dixie."" And his version of ""Dixie"" is fab-uuu-lous!!! (although why he selected ""Dixie"" is beyond me).
Director Larry Charles described this movie to the press as, ""Shakespeare done by John Cassavetes"" - a ""post-apocalyptic, sci-fi, film noir, spaghetti western."" I'd have to agree with him. Again, I loved the movie - but I would love anything that featured Bob Dylan.

1201706,5,B00000F2L9,"This is a an ambitious film.  It is dense with metaphor and allusion throughout, and I was left feeling that I comprehended a mere fraction.  Repeated viewings would doubtless be rewarding, and I plan to watch it again, preferably with folks who know more about the history of the blues.  Dylan is the ""simple"" bard making his way through an apocalyptic society torn by dictatorship, corruption, and civil war -- a contemporary Hell. (The sets have a prescient and eerie resemblance to footage coming out of Iraq.)  If Dylan is Virgil, it is by virtue of the songs themselves, poetic ballads that address the profound questions, yet whose significance, as Dylan comments at the end of the film, remains in the eyes of the beholder.  Hearing the songs covered by other artists provides a fresh window on their brilliance, and there is a little girl who will break your heart with her georgeously-phrased a cappella version of ""The Times They Are A-Changin'.""  There are also some spectacular Pynchon-like stream of consciousness monologues by a cadre of talented actors on various themes, often punctuated at the end by a cryptic/irreverent/oracular comment from Dylan.  I was entertained by the juxtaposition of silly humor, which in some instances resonated with the more nuanced literary points, such as the leopard joke (""What did the monkey say to the leopard at the card game? I thought you were a cheetah."")which nevertheless evokes the leopard Dante encounters in the first canto of The Inferno.  And unlike some other reviewers, I found Dylan's acting pretty natural, and got the sense he actually did lay it on the line with respect to his personal viewpoint.  This is not to say the film is a total success -- but rather even where it veers into obscure digression and fails to engage the audience, it fails nobly by aspiring to be all that film can be.",1083196800,,1863,4.870253164556962
1201707,1,B00000F2L9,"If conservative talk show hosts wanted a target for the inanity of Hollywood's political beliefs, they'd do well to rent Bob Dylan's ""Masked and Anonymous.""
It isn't particularly liberal - it's incoherent ramblings about a quasi-authoritarian future America, couched in some plot about a benefit concert that stars Dylan as folk singer Jack Fate, recently freed from jail and - get this - son of the authoritarian leader. Two concert promoters (John Goodman and Jessica Lange) bite their nails over Fate's appearance, Luke Wilson is the roadie to end all roadies, while a rock journalist (Jeff Bridges) is assigned to the story, a hitman (Mickey Rourke) intends to party poop, and so on and so on.
The movie unfurls like a Dylan song, with roundabouts and twistaroos and ""ironies"" such as a freedom fighter switching sides to fight his own kind because they were too dogmatic. This character is played by Giovanni Ribisi, who eventually gets so ticked off during his monologue - the entire movie is monologues, most of which are given while Dylan sits silently next to a B-list cameo actor - that he jumps off a bus and deliberately gets shot. Uh huh. Like most Dylan songs, ""Masked and Anonymous"" is rich with everything but discipline - if it ekes every so slightly toward Making A Definitive Point it recedes, Dylan-style, back into a squint and shrug - and listening to a happy accident is great deal more fun than watching it.
If The Truth is that everybody's hands are dirty, fine - use that as a line a dialogue and make the other 90 minutes about something else entirely. Of course, if Dylan and director Larry Charles were so enamored with authenticity, they wouldn't have credited themselves as Sergei Petrov and Rene Fontaine for writing the screenplay.",1082851200,4,1764,4.863787375415282

This is art imitating life and doing a dandy job... its not the ""feel good movie of the year"" and Siskel and Ebert did not give this movie ""two thumbs up"". The bottom line is folks would rather be entertained than think about their entertainment. If your not one of them, I highly recommend you see this movie. Bob Dylan may not be a great ""actor""... but, for his part he really doesn't have to be. And with a cast like this... acting is really not an issue.

However, repeated viewings produce more pieces of the puzzle. You may never put it all together, but you will at some point have a partial or near complete picture.

Throughout the film the audience hears thunder in the background, and in the end a storm erupts. Physically and symbolically. Bob Dylan's performance is somewhat dry at points, but he is merely playing himself. You can not judge him as an actor because he is a singer, a songwriter. The music in the movie was done entirely by him, even the songs not sung by him were written by him and they all have a connecting theme, imperialism. There are many cameos in the film and to the average moviegoer they will seem pointless, but in fact each of these cameos are symbolic representations of human characteristics. If you notice in the credits each person is labled as either ""the soldier"", ""the drunk"", etc. That soldier and that drunk can represent every soldier and drunk in the world.

To make things worse, the cast of stars here seems lifted from those who feel desperate to be seen paying homage to the man, grovelling to be in the limelight next to Dylan before Dylan is no more.

The movie itself, particularly the plot, is a thinly disguised yarn of Dylan's career, focusing on his latter years, the forgotten hero, and the birth of the mother of all comebacks:  Playing a concert to save the world, or some such thing.  Such embarrassing stuff would make good self-mockery of an artist of lesser statue.  With Dylan, however, it comes across as pathetic:  the man pays homage to himself, brayed on by a cast of hangers-on.  Truly sad.

Now for the acting and the script.  Bob is as expressive as a plank of wood.  To say anything less than that would be sheer praise.  The others are perfunctory, only there to get Bob through it all. And the script is just as miserable. Thankfully, Bob does not have so many lines himself, but his 'pearls of wisdom' are thrown in as disembodied reflections at 'crucial' moments between scenes, an irritating and repetitive technique that only adds a sense sanctimonious phoniness to an already phony-soaked production.  Honestly, whoever directed this should be banned from future film work.

In all, the movie is a shocker of poor taste and abysmal judgement, revealing much more about those behind/in it, than about the story itself.  After the great ""Love & Theft"" album, it is nothing short of distressing to see Dylan stoop to such depths, tarnishing what would otherwise have been a brilliant end to a brilliant career.

Leaving through the wrong door, I found myself outside with no way to reenter except through the lobby. Would I be stopped and asked to produce the ticket stub that I feared I had thrown away?
I returned to the theater without incident, no questions asked. But I had questions of my own, notably what is the point of ""Masked and Anonymous""? In retrospect, I suppose there is no easy answer. One can't explain ""Masked and Anonymous"" any more than one can explain ""Visions of Johanna"" or ""Desolation Row,"" or dozens of other Dylan songs. It is what it is, and you either get it or you don't.
I'm not sure I get it, but I can't say I didn't have fun trying. For die-hard Dylan fans, ""Masked and Anonymous"" should be worthwhile. For someone whose CD collection includes ""Blood on the Tracks"" and ""Greatest Hits,"" but not ""Self-Portrait"" and ""Knocked Out Loaded,"" this film may inspire more impatient head-scratching than enjoyment. Those who have followed Dylan's career through the main roads, as well as the back-alleys, may find ""Masked and Anonymous"" rewarding.
Both should be pleased with the music. It's great to hear the brilliant ""Blind Willie McTell"" on the soundtrack, but best of all is the concert footage, including a terrific and all too brief version of ""Dixie,"" and a pleasant take on ""I'll Remember You,"" a track not available on the officially released soundtrack.
As for the acting, John Goodman and Jeff Bridges give their all, while Dylan remains distant, as enigmatic as ever, a guest in his own film.

1201771,5,B00000F2L9,"To see this movie is to somewhat see another side of the enigmatic and mysterious Bob Dylan. A Dylan who has put up with the harshness of critics for 40 years. A Dylan, who like his namesake Jack Fate in the movie, who has been never been forgotten and has many loyal friends, followers, and fans. A Dylan who, like Fate, is released from the man built prison but must struggle to be free from the walls that life has built up to keep him down, to hold back the waters of the floodgates of the thoughts in his mind.
Bob Dylan is a genius. And this movie helps to prove that. Too many movies nowadays try to push sex and violence to entertain forgetting that there are a few people whose intelligence is not turned on by a fast high speed car crash. This is a thinking man movie.
With an all star cast the plot line centers on John Goodman as a sleazy promoter(imagine that)named Uncle Sweetheart who is putting on a benefit concert to help support the poor people of an unnamed country which has been torn apart by corruption, wicked politics, rebel uprisings, and much violence.(Sounds like most countries today) Of course Sweetheart's main goal is to pay off his bad debts. Dylans character, Jack Fate, is freed from a prison to perform at the concert. Fate must deal with the sleaze that surrounds the benefit as well as wrestle with the demons of his past and reconcile with his father,the president of the country, who is on his deathbed. He must also deal with a hardcore drunken reporter whos last name is Friend but he is anything but. The questions he ask Fate are very well related to things Dylan has had to deal with throughout his career.
This movie features great acting, a well thought out story line if you get it, and excellent music as Dylan performs several updated versions of his great masterpieces live in the film with his band, the tightest back up band ever!
The movie shows Dylan as a natural at acting, makes several points that can ring home and that most anyone can relate to. This is a must for any Dylan fan and without giving away the ending, all I can say is it's a simple twist of fate!",1077580800,6,2120,4.410714285714286

It certainly helps to be a Bob Dylan fan, but I think it is intrinsically interesting, thoughtful and original on its own merits. Believe it or not, I picked up this movie at the video store without knowing much about it, and I didn't even realize the central character was Bob Dylan until he sang! (call me the Clueless Critic ). My point is, I had been enjoying the film up to that point, and continued to do so. As in other surrealistic movies (e.g. Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas,  movies by David Lynch or Jim Jarmusch), you have to accept that you aren't going to get a linear plot and open yourself to the experience. I found the satirical manner in which a war and revolution-stricken Third World nation was portrayed darkly hilarious. It is a hellish montage of every poor country on earth. The downtrodden people are, improbably, of all different races and religions. Dylan himself (who was criticized for his lack of acting) plays a stone-faced version of himself named Jack Fate. He has been hired to play a benefit for this unnamed country by a corrupt promoter (John Goodman). It would be almost pointless to try to describe the plot any further. What this film is really about is the bizarre imagery, dialogue and atmosphere (and, of course, music). Characters are constantly having conversations where truisms and conventional thinking are twisted into humorously wise Zenlike nonsense.  Although Dylan apparently did not write or direct this film, he seemingly could have. Both promoters and reporters (in the guise of a pestering, gun-toting one played by Jeff Bridges) are portrayed as slimy predators. Although it is true that Dylan doesn't really act in this film, his total lack of expression adds something to the surreal effect. An actor who was trying too hard to appear funny or brilliant would have ruined it. Dylan sings several songs; there is also a surprisingly good rendition of his classic, ""The Times they are a'Changin'"" sung by a very young girl. This is obviously not a movie for everyone, but I found it more interesting and entertaining than any  I've seen in quite a while.",1077408000,21,2259,4.877604166666667
1201798,2,B00000F2L9,"Just finished watchin' yet another of BOB DYLAN's Oscar Caliber performances
(NOT!) Glad I waited for Home Video.
OK, I's gets it. Life's a Stage. Life's a Carnival (note the
Circus-cum-""Rolling Thunder Review"" like back drops on the set). Enough.
Bob Dylan as JACK ""Oooh Im so Cryptic, Im the people's Misunderstood
Freakin' Enigma"" FATE as Martyr.
Its actually funny that Someone shanghied a group of
Investors (this is how Independent Movies get made) out
of 4 or 5 Million ""Zimmer-Yens"" to lens this Incomprehensible Pile of
Steamin' Mudlark (a Pheasant like bird native to Minnesota) Turds.
Whats even funnier is to read the reviews of the many ""BOBHEADS""
who pretend they ""Understand"" this Mess. On one of the DVD extras
the director ""quotes"" Dylan as saying the reason for doing this
movie was the journey getting there, not the end result. I guess like traveling down Highway 61, stopping off in every Podunk/No Nothing town for dinner, only to find the exact same Crappy Conveniece store in every town with only a few Stale Candy Bars to eat. Man I's gots to have some nourishment, something SOLID along the way, sometimes. Not just Mars Bars and SOCIOPOLITICAL
ramblings by some philosophy major working the late nite shift.
Yeah I get the ""veiled"" referances to Dylan's life. Angela
Bassett as the Black ""Back up Singer"" he had a affair with
and produced an illegitamate child (the little black girl
singing  ""times they are a changing""?) Fate/Dylan as  Political
Commentator-Everyman Troubador.  Was that John Goodman....or Albert
Grossman? Then there's the  Car Crash; or was it a Motorcycle Crash? Hmmn.
In all fairness, the musical numbers were Great -featuring
Dylan's  real touring Band (including Charlie Sexton), the
soundtrack's score was good (Dylan classics sung in several foreign
languages). But that was only a 3rd the movie.
I could almost forgive the plot if Dylan could act, or ACT
like he cared. He's a walkin' stiff through the movie. Most of the MANY
cameos seem like they're phonin' their lines in. Only John Goodman and Ed
Harris (In ""Black-Face""...
dont' ask!) looked like they were enjoying themselves.
This movie is about 30 years too late. If this would've been released in
1972 or 1973 when much more of the
world was more in-tune with what was going on politically, I couldve seen
this flick taken on a life of its own , especially with the College Age
Liberally minded folks who caught Medium Cool and Zabriskie Point and
talked at length about the symbolism and hidden meanings
in Goddard and Jodorowski movies.
Dylan's music and his songs' messages are just as relavent today, however
the movie doesnt even approach the fact that it wants to land any message
itself. The movie is what it is, a cerebral Dry hump.",1077321600,12,2754,4.901287553648069
1201799,5,B00000F2L9,"Dylan, and his character Jack Fate, are just incredibly compelling. His Bobness is an extremely strange human being, as we all know by his music, but to see the man walk and talk and interact with other people (actors) is nothing short of surreal. The movie moves like a dream. It is by no means all neat and tidey. It requires you to suspend preconceptions and needs to be seen repeatedly (and even then its up in the air). And then there's the musical performances. Worth the price of the dvd alone. Dylan and His Band rock in a way here before unseen in any movie ever (period).",1077235200,3,581,4.388888888888889
1201800,2,B00000F2L9,"There shouldn't be a doubt in anyone's mind that Bob Dylan is an artist and, in my opinion, a great artist.  He's been producing work for over 40 years, and much of it has imbedded itself in American, if not world culture.  First and foremost, he's a brilliant lyricist and master of artistic revelation, he's also a composer of sorts, but his music has never been all that complex.  When he received a songwriting award he mentioned that he didn't read music, and didn't plan to learn.  He's certainly accomplished in folk, blues, gospel, and in the way those forms melt into rock and roll; and he's even got some cool jazz licks in his repertoire, but no one will ever mistake him for a ""serious composer"" though his heart, hand, ear, and mind are connected and he has the tools and collaborators he needs to get his musical vision out to the public.  He's also written prose, though not that well; poetry, but outside his gift for song lyrics his poetry isn't very good; and screenplays, but no awards will be heading his way in that category; which brings us to, ""Masked & Anonymous.""
I think Dylan has written a script that's a lot more coherent than some reviewers believe but it's not tight enough to be compelling, and it's not directed with the rhythm or consistency needed to lift it beyond a series of scenes, or to make it as interesting as any of Dylan's more surreal lyrics.  I actually think the failure of ""Masked & Anonymous,"" has more to do with direction than writing, and though I don't know how much of a hand Dylan had in that all indications are he and Larry Charles were close collaborators.  For a Bob Dylan work that's probably as it should be, but for a script written by Dylan and directed by Charles the director should have had a firmer hand. Someone has written that the performances were as cartoonish as they needed to be, but they weren't cartoonish, they were just bad.  Bad as in ""undirected.""  The movie  seems to have been directed in the same way a Dylan album is produced, only less skillfully as Dylan is not an accomplished cinema artist in the way he's an accomplished musician.

""Masked & Anonymous,"" is going to live as a cultural artifact with a wider distribution than ""Reynaldo and Clara,"" but it's not any better a movie.  In fact, I think ""Reynaldo and Clara,"" will end up being the better piece of film making because its visual and thematic pretensions were held more closely in check, and because its milieu was a chaotic reality rather than a fantasy.  But even with that being said, ""Reynaldo and Clara,"" isn't so much a good movie as a noble failure.
Like other reviewers, I recommend ""Masked & Anonymous,"" for those of us who can't seem to get enough of Dylan, and for students of Dylan's art, but certainly not for anyone looking for a developed work of art, or even a good movie.",1077148800,27,2838,4.541176470588235
1201801,5,B00000F2L9,"I watched this with lowered expectations. The bits I've seen of Ranaldo & Clara didn't really grab me. But after watching this twice, I'm still stunned and weirdly delighted. As surrealistic as his prime ""Desolation Row"" lyrics all fleshed out by some great actors. The use of language is thrilling and poetically eloquent. Yeah, people don't talk like this in ""real life"", and this is archly artful and self consciosly poetic in ways that will make some cringe. But Bob's fire and flinty vision pulses through this film with the same vitality as his best songs. And the music is worth the price of admission on it's own. I hope he makes 20 more films with Mr. Charles. The wide world needs more perfectly dream logical fractured visions like this.",1077062400,3,748,4.7615384615384615
1201802,4,B00000F2L9,"I really enjoyed this film. I really didn't know what to expect as Dylan's forays into film have been irratic at best. This isn't a film that you will walk away from saying ""That changed my life,"" but it is one that I will watch repeatedly in the future. M&A feels like a 106 min visual Bob Dylan song. Take that for what you will.",1077062400,3,331,4.107692307692307
1201803,3,B00000F2L9,"Here's a movie that got me thinking, I had to give it a chance. It has a plot, but it just hangs together so you might consider that a bad aspect, but in fact I think what is being conveyed is life in a series of images that in the end may not show much except that people try to make sense out of life in their own way. What motivates their decisions is the key.
In order to make sense of the movie I had have to try and figure out what Dylan's world view is. He is not a close friend of mine so I guessed based on  his songs. I think he thinks we all are prostituting our morality whenever it seems convenient and that if we don't stop we are headed towards (or already in) the society shown in the movie which will eventually be purged somehow.... one of Dylan's themes in his music is a flood. There is no reference to this in the movie, but my feeling is that it is a probable outcome and on a biblical level. (Is this what Dylan would have seen as the end? All I can do is guess.)
The subject of fame and media is a big part of the movie. One of the best scenes is Dylan talking to Jeff Bridges (playing a reporter). Bridges brings his own set of biases into the interview where Dylan answers none of the questions and at the end Bridges says he ""has his story"". Are we looking for ""answers"" from Dylan and making up our own answers as we go along so that we can feel that someone out there, we think, has a better insight into life. Meanwhile Dylan just goes along writing and performing. It is what he does and the rest of us react.
Enough philosphy, the performances I think are great. The concert footage is terrific... how often can you see Dylan like this?
If you give this movie a chance it is worth it, but I had to drop some preconceptions about plots and story lines and go along for the ride.
Every ride will be different and maybe the end won't be recognizable or.....",1077062400,2,1886,4.083557951482479
1201804,5,B00000F2L9,"Either you'll love this movie or you won't. You probably already know which camp you're in. Personally, as a fan of both Bob Dylan and international cinema, I thought it was the most exciting and original film I saw last year.
The ""extras"" on this DVD are great. They include five deleted scenes, among them a great performance of the song Standing in the Doorway. The way Dylan sings it is absolutely killer. It should have included it in the movie.
After watching these deleted scenes, I felt as though director Larry Charles's three hour cut may be the definitive one. I hope we get to see it some day.
There is also a 15 minute documentary about the making of the movie that includes great interview clips with Larry Charles and most of the cast. During this doc, you see a lot of behind the scenes footage of the making of the movie, including footage of Dylan on the set. Several times you see him smiling and laughing while talking to the other actors and crew members; he looks like he's having a good time.
You also get to see a _very_ tantalizing clip of Dylan and his band playing Knockin' on Heaven's Door, a scene that wasn't included in the film. The only complaint I have is that this documentary is way too short. A lot of what the actors have to say is reduced to sound bites; someone will start to say something really interesting but then they'll cut to someone else.
Also of interest is Larry Charles's audio commentary in which he sheds light on his inspiration for a lot of the scenes, costumes, locations, etc. He also points out who a lot of the bit players are, which is interesting. For instance, the woman who plays ""Mrs. Brown"" is one of Bob's daughters-in-law.
All in all, well worth the twenty bucks I paid for it.",1077062400,6,1744,4.453125
1201805,4,B00000F2L9,"Two things will really add to the appreciation of thid film. 1. An extremely open mind and 2. a working knowledge of Bob Dyaln; his history, his philosophy, his music. This is not a high budget film. Think more surrealist art house film. It does have many stars that most people will recognize, but that isn't the focus, nor point of the movie. This is the highly metaphorical tale of a musician and how he can't control his place in a chaotic society, but can remain true to his own self amid the chaos.
  The very loosely woven plot becomes secondary to the individual events which make up the film, each scene revealing a nugget of Dylan's perspevtive. Dylan often delivers comments that make the entire scene seem irrelevant. In this way this is, at times, a very funny film. Dylan seems relaxed, especially compared to the other films he has made. The feeling is much more ""Don't Look Back"", much less ""Hearts of Fire"". He does retain his wooden movement and he delivers his short lines as commentary more often than conversation.
  The soundtrack is exceptional. The performances are a real treat. All Dylan songs, but unique versions which fit seemlessly into the texture of the movie. The little girl singing ""The Times They are A-Changin"" will at least choke you up a bit, and possibly help us to remeber exactly how much that song meant 41 years ago, and how much it still means today.
  I certainly recommend this to Dylan fans, especially those who respect or admire his perspective on the world. Anyone who enjoys non formulatic surreal films may also find much enjoyment in this movie. There is too much to pick everything up in your first screening when looking for interesting comments or details. I would recommend trying to watch and a get a feel for the film initially. Don't drive yourself crazy trying to make sense of every detail. In that way it is like most of Dylan's music, to be experienced repeatedly.",1076976000,55,1929,4.67551622418879
1201806,5,B00000F2L9,"After reading the other reviews i felt compelled to make an observation.
This film is unpolished, low budget, no special effects and no inspiring performances.
BUT it has fantastic dylan live performances with his road band. dylan has gotten better and better and these performances prove he is still one of music and poetry's finest.
Definately a must for any Dylan fan.
Definately a ""pass"" for movie buffs.",1076371200,6,408,5.014705882352941
1201807,1,B00000F2L9,"As a Dylan fan, I went to see this in the theater even though I suspected I would agree with the overwhelmingly negative reviews. And I do. This film is a travesty, the kind of pretentious and pointless foolishness that might have seemed to possess bottomless depths and hidden meanings in the Sixties when people seemed not to be thinking clearly (listening to records backwards and treating their bodies like a pharmacy). For those who think Dylan is something other than a great singer and songwriter (which is all he is, folks, and isn't that enough?), there may be layers upon layers of wisdom to be found in this trifle, but I think they're either kidding themselves or engaging in wishful thinking.
It's kind of sad that Dylan didn't step aside and simply agree to appear as an ""actor"" in this film rather than write it, too (under a pseudonym). He may not be an actor, but he has a real presence and an eccentric quality that could make him a fine comic performer. And with that cast, this could have been good. Instead, like the atrocious ""Hearts of Fire,"" it's just another missed opportunity.
The Amazon.com reviewer compares this to one of Dylan's songs, but a movie is not a song, just as a movie is not a book. The best books rarely make the best movies, and the best songs succeed because they can't be translated into another medium. Just as a book is a book, a song is a song, and a movie is a movie.
