8417353,4,B0046LUACM,"This film really opens your eyes on how poorly the Native People have been treated by the US.. Sadly, the sound is so bad, the Narrator is difficult to hear at times, those being interviewed are really hard to hear, even with subtitles it is difficult. The sound effects, either added after, or what ever, are so loud it is ear splitting. Everyone should watch this, but subtitles are your friends for this one. Do not watch with earphones, the sound effects will deafen you.",1528761600,,475,4.6
