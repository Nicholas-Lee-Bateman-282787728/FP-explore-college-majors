8481272,4,B0007IR4JK,"Pictured here is a mid-1980s PRISM brand VHS of the 1978 TV movie, LADY OF THE HOUSE. This is from the era when videos each cost $70 or more and the quality shows. It's a sturdy tape, twice as heavy in weight than the final flimsy VHSes MGM issued in the early 2000s, that's stored in a durable oversized clamshell case.

Although a quarter-century old, you will find that this video plays flawessly, as does my PRISM dub of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-USERS/dp/B000ANH438/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE USERS</a>, which was issued around the same time as ""Lady of the House."" Both are recorded in SP mode, have clean HiFi audio and a nice full screen picture.

""Lady of the House"" is a factually loose biopic of SALLY STANFORD (5/5/03 - 2/1/82). She was born Mabel Busby in a small Oregon town and relocated in 1924 to San Francisco. For a decade Sally ran an upscale bordello located on Nob Hill. A raid on her leisure palace by D.A. Edmond ('Pat') Brown Sr. led to his 1950 election as California's Attorney General. Brown also served two terms as Governor, successfully defeating Richard Nixon's challenge in 1962. His son Jerry, who served two Governor terms (1975-83) is returning to the job in 2011.

After Brown closed her cat house, Stanford operated a restaurant in the Bay-area town of Sausalito. She ran for city council six time and was finally elected in 1972. Four years later, a re-election majority made Sally mayor of Sausalito at age 72.

Fourth-billed here is Susan Tyrell, the self-styled gypsy best remembered as queen of the Sixth Dimension in ichard Elfman's bizarro cult classic,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FORBIDDEN-ZONE/dp/B0002LE9QS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FORBIDDEN ZONE</a>&nbsp;(1982). San Fran's mayor is played by Melvin Belli, the high profile ""King of Torts"" attorney who defended many celebrities. His most infamous client was Lee Oswald's killer, Jack Ruby.

Also in the cast are Armand Assante and Colleen Camp, a specialist who's played more cops than any other actress.
