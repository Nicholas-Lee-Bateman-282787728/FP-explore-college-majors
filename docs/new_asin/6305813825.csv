8315748,3,6305813825,"Any review of this film would have to start out by stating that it is part of the Hitlers war machine series. This series consists of captured Nazi propaganda films. As the title suggests, this one stresses the German campaigns in the Crimea in 1941 and 1942. The primary emphasis is on 1942, with the campaigns that led to the capture of Kerch (located in the far eastern part of part of the isthmus) and the fortress of the Sevastopol (one of the worlds great fortresses of the time).

The film itself is, pretty much, unedited. It is in German with English subtitles and with the original poor quality graphics (i.e., maps and associated animations) of films of the time. There appears to have been no remastering of the actual film or soundtrack. Hence the viewer sees what viewers of these films would have seen during the second world war. This is unlike, say, the DVDs of the the archive collection (or the war archive collection or war archives  unfortunately this reviewer cannot remember the exact title of the series) where captured propaganda footage is presented but with a British voice offer providing an analysis of the relevant military hardware and campaigns (this reviewer highly recommends these, primarily due to the quality of the analysis offered even though the voice over is quite monotone).

These films are what one would expect to see from a propaganda film. This includes no German losses, no footage of the bloodshed and horror that is war, plenty of footage of large numbers of Soviet troops being captured (with nothing on showing their fates  usually death), nothing on what happened to the civilians of these captured territories, atrocities, etc. There are some surprises though. For one, the films show plenty of horses in the service of the German army. Although horses were quite numerous, one would think that propagandists would be a little apprehensive of showing that the mighty German army was not as mechanized as proclaimed (even though the reality was that armoured and mechanized divisions only accounted for about 15% or so of all German divisions). On the positive side, the film does show front line infantry combat, albeit without losses.

For those interested in a more serious examination (but short) of the campaigns covered in this film (i.e., Kerch and investment of Sevastopol) this reviewer highly recommends Robert Forczycks Sevastopol 1942: Von Mansteins Triumph published by Osprey publishing.",1475280000,2,2454,5.0344827586206895
8315749,4,6305813825,"Superb footage of both sides of the war between the nazis and

the communists.

A ""bit"" complacent with the russian side because of the enormous

sacrifices committed by the populace and also the fact that

Stalin was an ally at the time...

Still, a lot of very knowledgeable comments and info from John Erickson.

Maps could have been better. Running commentary clearly not

objective but then very few are concerning this period of

recent history.",1113091200,3,451,4.92
8315750,5,6305813825,"This set of four videos, featuring analysis by Professor John Erickson of the University of Edinburgh, is a model for the intelliegent presentation of military history via video. This medium is especially appropriate where,  as was the case on the Eastern Front, everything was done on a large scale,  both in terms of the distances and the number of troops involved in complex  military actions.

Professor Erickson is especially impressive --  knowledgeable and unbiased, yet modest, his sole obhective is simply to  inform and to talk about a subject that obviously fascinates him.

If you  have any interest in military history, or even if you have none, you should  consider buying these videos. They are superb.

UPDATE: NOTE: This program is available in four separate DVDs titled The Russian Front:
