655721,5,6303421849,"My friend got me hooked into ER a year ago and I could not stop watching it. I watch the episodes every Thursday on NBC, but this movie is the best of all. I got this for Christmas one year, and since then I have probably seen it 20 times. It gives me a good feeling whenever I watch it, which horror movies can't do, and I love horror movies (just click see more about me to find out!) The music sets the tone for the movie. The movie is perfect and I couldn't see how it could get any better. It is weird to think that only a few characters from this movie still live on in the show today. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes hospitals, medical dramas, or just anyone who likes that feeling of a good movie. That is how good this movie is.",1013299200,6,754,4.0

655724,5,6303421849,"In case that you are not one of those who have been watching the series for the last years, one must addmit that this is the most outstanding series on my personal note have ever seen!  The first time I watch the pilot episode of this on going drama, I was surely impressed in what way the directors have achieved to frame such a stunning and even moreover impressive plot, combining the personal - emotional ""everday - life as an ER - MD"" with the bare facts and procedures of such kind of a professional, whose daily job it is to save the lives of our loved and pursue to provide their well-being, although, quite natural, not always being capable of attaining those high set standards of ""service"". Alltogether, if not already being addicted to this kind of genre, it is a worthwhile investment to buy this premiere episode in order to get an idea of what you have missed so far...",986256000,10,884,4.45679012345679
655725,5,6303421849,If you just got into ER you would want to catch up with this VHS.A must have if your the #1 ER fan. Be cool!!!!,984528000,,111,3.48
655726,5,6303421849,"""E.R."" was not a ground breaking drama in any way, but it brought the energy of an urban Emergency Room to television.  Not since ""St. Elsewhere"" had there been a decent doctor show on television.  I can remember early on in that series they had one act in which they had an emergency case in their E.R.  It was more intense and more realistic than anything I had ever seen on television up to that time.  On ""E.R."" they usually have at least two such emergencies going on at the same time.  More importantly, although the personal lives of the doctors and nurses come into play, they are rarely the main emphasis of what we see each week.  All of this is clearly established in the pilot episode.
When you watch the pilot movie, now six years old, there are two things to keep in mind.  First, the original script began with Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield) being rudely awaken, not Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards).  Think what a difference that would have made to the show.  Second, pay attention to the difference in the characterization of Peter Benton (Eriq LaSalle) in the pilot, which is definitely the one role that changed the most, even more so than Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies) who was originally slated to die from her overdose.  Of course, it was nice to see George Clooney in ""E.R."" since I remember him so fondly from his first television series, ""E/R.""",974246400,16,1373,4.636363636363637
655727,5,6303421849,"Oh, nothing, nothing at ALL can compare to ER! It's definitely THE best drama ever! And this great episode is where it all started... ER Rocks! Get the tape! Get all the tapes!",959385600,5,176,4.363636363636363
655728,5,6303421849,"""ER"" is the best medical drama ever. It has a little bit of gore for realization. The characters are well developed and deep ( with the acception of cleo ) Every eppisode has humor, an amount of seriousness and  romance (not chick flicky either). The actors and actresses are very  good,and the supporting actors are good too. they add a lightness to the  more tragic eppy's, which there are some that can get to you. this show  provides a typical day in a chicago general emergency room , filled with  excitment! where you'll find bumbling medical students(lol) , knowledgable  surgons , stressed out ""ER"" residents, and the calm and cool  nurses that keep things running as smoothly as the  ""ER"" can get!",954806400,6,706,4.729508196721311

 ER - The Series Premiere [VHS]

 i found that i already have it
i did not open the package,I tried to resell it at amazon.com and they only accept a one cent i.e a penny for it?
I imagine that is the reason that amazon is getting richer by the day?",1310169600,,277,3.9107142857142856
7847910,2,6303421849,"This is not a review of this specific title, but rather of Warner Brothers' ""TV Premiere DVD"" series as a whole.  I would like to make you aware of my issues with features that are apparently prevalent in ALL of the titles in this series, based upon my purchase of one of these titles (""The Flintstones - The Flintstone Flyer"").

Although the list of issues below was written specifically for The Flintstones DVD, I highly suspect that most (if not all) of it applies to this and all of the other titles in the ""TV Premiere DVD"" series.  Be sure to check out The Flintstones page to see the photos that I uploaded which better illustrate the packaging and disc printing issues mentioned below.

-- The disc does not come in a plastic case, but rather in a cardboard sleeve which opens on the side.  I've purchased $1 public domain DVDs from no-name companies that came in plastic slim cases, so it's appalling that a $6 DVD from a big-name company would be done so cheaply.  Also, the sleeve has a hole at the top in the center where the peg would go for it to be hung on a rack like an action figure or toy.  The hole has been edited out of the promo photos that Warner Bros. gave Amazon to display for the DVDs.

-- The text on the disc is very faint and hard to read - another way Warner Bros. skimped on production costs.

-- The cheapness doesn't stop at the packaging.  The DVD does not contain a menu, not even a plain one.  Because of this, there's an interesting glitch that happens if you let the DVD play past the episode.  You see, after the episode plays, it goes to a FBI Warning on title 3, which then goes to the non-existent menu, so the player just hangs on a black screen.

-- They were even cheap in the placement of the chapters marks, which are placed every ten minutes (0:00, 10:00, and 20:00) no matter if it makes sense in the episode content for one to be there or not.

-- From what I've read, most (if not all) of the titles in the ""TV Premiere DVD"" series were originally released on VHS and/or laserdisc, with these DVDs being done from the VHS and laserdisc masters.  The quality of The Flintstones DVD definitely appears to be better than VHS, so either it came from a laserdisc master, or not all of the titles were done from old home video masters.

Although at first I didn't mind paying $6 for one 26 minute Flintstones episode, that was before I knew that the DVD didn't even come in a plastic case.  Now that six dollars really seems like a rip-off.

7847911,5,6303421849,This sure takes me back to why I loved and still love ER!!  I have the first season also and have really enjoyed going back to the first episodes.  This is a great pilot and series.,1173312000,,181,4.0
7847912,1,6303421849,I love ER but don't waste your money on this pilot issue if you've got season 1.  This is just the same as the first two hours of season 1.  Yes I did waste money on it because I read here that the pilot was different from the first show.,1135468800,14,238,3.74
7847913,5,6303421849,"Greetings...I just got done watching this video for the first time. I had been a fan of ""ER"" off and on since it started, but have recently given up watching the show because they killed off several characters that I was rather fond of, and it kind of spoiled the show for me after that. This video makes it clear that ER was, in it's glory days, the best drama on T.V. Anyone who buys this tape will see that, even if they aren't familiar with the show. Watch for an unusual performance by Miguel Ferrer as a patient reacting to his awful diagnosis...Miguel would go on later to a starring role as Dr. Garret Macy on ""Crossing Jordan"".

Diehard fans of ER will be interested to see how all the characters evolved from this starting point, way back in 1995. I gave it 5 stars!",1104710400,7,776,4.315068493150685
7847914,5,6303421849,"ER was brilliant. I was just sitting there without taking my eyes off the T.V. If you love the drama and suspense this is your show. It was so real unlike other shows where you know where all the gadgets and computer animation was done, it was like you were right there next to the doctors and looking at the patient. ER shows the truth behind being a doctor in the hospital its turns, ups and downs and consequences. Although we know none of its real, all fiction it is very alive and realistic. Watching it over and over never got boring for me, it was just better. It was very interesting getting to know the crew and its begginning. I give ER the best ratting five out of five.",1041638400,4,681,4.246153846153846
7847915,5,6303421849,"Years ago, when Dr. Mark Green had hair, and Carter looked like a high school graduate, ER debuted. It has been one of the most succesful shows on TV ever! and although many of its original starts are no longer in the shows, it still rocks.
If you are a fan (if you are reading this, you probably are), see how every thing got started. The long shifts, the bad pay, the terrible food and the addiction to coffee, these actors made ER what it is today. I love it. Every now and then I watch the pilot again. It moves me all the time.
See Mark Green in action and Dr. Benton's attitude in a pilot that started it all.
Do yourself a favor and buy it. You will not regret it.
Enjoy the show!",1032134400,25,687,4.0588235294117645
7847916,5,6303421849,"This video is a movie length two parter. If you're a DIEHARD ER fan, the first two SEASONS (with the third on the way) are available at Amazon's UK sister store. Surprisingly these are not listed in the Amazon links at the IMDB. Highly recommended to anyone who loves good absorbing drama.",1021507200,12,289,4.576923076923077
7847917,4,6303421849,I purchased this video thinking that ewan mcgregor was in it. The way it is advertised makes you think that.
