8639248,5,B00I4FJIT2,"I am a fan of Bad company i only have their albums from the self titled CD until their 1978 album
but i like Led zeppelin more
there's been many bootleg VHS/DVD Doco's on Bad company since the early 80's, 90's, 2000's
even the Inside Bad company DVD'S were unauthorised Documentary's about the band
that only had new interviews with Critics, band managers, record producers
and were stealing archive interviews of paul rodgers & simon kirke that was never permitted by the band members

so there's never actually been an official Documentary by the band members themselves until now
i bought this new blu-ray out of curiosity really
and i tell you what it's been worth the wait worth the money to buy it, better late than never i guess

Produced & Directed by Jon brewer and officially Authorised by the band members themselves
the Doco starts with the Beginings of Bad company until last year 2014 when this blu-ray was released
all new in depth interviews with Paul rodgers, Mick ralphs & simon kirke as they give recollections of the 70's, 80'S, 90'S, 2000''s
and how they were signed to Led zeppelin's label Swan song
plus all 3 members talk about behind the scenes stories that have never been heard before
they talk about their band member Drug addiction problem who tragically died in 1974-75
they talk about their Run with the pack tour, their 1978 tour
when Peter Grant left the business because Led zeppelin ended with John bonham in 1980
so of course bad company's management suffered
plus interviews with other musicians that have been influenced, inspired by Bad company
according to the back cover there's no mention of the runtime which i thought was very annoying
i can tell you the runtime is a full length 90mins & incredible 90 mins to i was Glued to the screen the whole time

there is some Bonus features,
more extended interviews with Paul rodgers, Mick ralphs, Simon kirke
very interesting extended interviews
Hard rock cafe Q & A session
Woodstock tour & Photo Gallery
all this one 1 Blu-ray Disc, incredible.
this blu-ray is ALL REGIONS, so it's not fixed to a certain region

so if your a big fan of Bad company and have all their albums or only have some of their albums from the 70's like myself
gets this new Documentary anyway, still very interesting to watch
5 stars i gave it, 90mins worth of interviews plus the extended interviews aswell
worth the money for sure",1421193600,8,2396,4.684085510688836
