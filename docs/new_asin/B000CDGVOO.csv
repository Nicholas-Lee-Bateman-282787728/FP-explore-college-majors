2458465,5,B000CDGVOO,"Whisper of the Heart is a wonderful Ghibli movie; although the animation style shows a bit of age, the visual compositions, the magic that makes the ordinary suddenly special, the human touch and warmth of people all make that totally inconsequential. Even if the characters might not be the smooth and flashy style, their movements, the life in them, let alone the breathtaking backgrounds are better than almost anything modern animation has produced.

The plot itself doesn't read as anything exciting that would make one pick up the movie, but that would be a mistake; Whisper of the Heart is about idealism, about love, about the emotions that make us human, that make life worth living. This doesn't make it a boring chick flick or art movie, though. The characters have enough quirks and humor to them to keep even an action aficionado entertained.

There is nothing adult about this movie, in the best senses of that word. No foul language, no sex, no drugs, no drinking, no violence. This is the kind of movie that you can show to a child of any age, from seven to a hundred and seven, and the magic will be there. It is the kind of work that inspires faith in humanity.",1136332800,37,1179,4.636363636363637
2458466,5,B000CDGVOO,"I am so glad that this Studio Ghibli gem is finally getting a U.S. release, so that it can get an even wider audience.

Unlike some better known Ghibli productions such as Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, Whisper of the Heart has very few fantasy elements; it's a story that is very 'real'. The setting of Whisper Of The Heart (original title: Mimi wo Sumaseba) is a typical Tokyo suburb, and the main protagonists are Suzuka and Seiji, a girl and a boy in junior high school. Suzuka is not quite sure yet what she wants to do with her life, but Seiji on the other hand has already found his lifes work. The themes this movie cover are universal, such as:

What does it mean to have, and pursue a dream? What is the use of  education? What does it mean to love someone? And so on.

This is a perfect family movie also, for kids over age 10 or so and up. The pace may be a bit too leisurely for younger kids and they may not quite get the themes of ambition, etc as well as older kids might,  though there is plenty of other elements to hold their attention, such as the gorgeous animation and the cheekiest cat imaginable. (There is absolutely nothing in this movie that's 'inappropriate' for young children in any way - just that the themes may be a bit difficult for them.) Adults who remember their teenage years would love this movie also. It made me remember what it was like to be 13 and unsure of myself and what I wanted to 'do with my life', and of hanging out with my friends, and the crushes I had on boys, etc. This movie is particularly great for young girls, since Suzuka, the main character, is one of the most realistically portrayed low-teen girls I've ever seen on screen. Ironic, since she's animated. (I wonder why so many Ghibli movies feature a girl as the main character?)

I do hope that Disney doesn't dub this with hyperactive voice actors - the original voices are quite calm and 'normal'.

Incidentally, this is a prequel of sorts to The Cat Returns (Neko no Ongaeshi), since a cat statue that appears in Whisper... comes to life so to speak in the more fantasy-oriented The Cat Returns. You can enjoy either movie on its own, however.",1135641600,73,2167,4.4025
2458467,5,B000CDGVOO,"Whisper of the heart is one of the most sensitive, heartwarming and beautiful films ever made. Based on a shojo manga by Aoi Hiiragi, Written and produced by Hayao Miyazaki and directed by Yoshifumi Kondo, whisper of the heart is a tale of self discovery and coming of age of a high school girl Shizuku who is not sure what she wants in life. A series of dramatic events bring her closer to a guy Seiji from her own school. Together they embark on a journey which will help them find their inner potentials, realize their dreams and also love for each other. Also featured in the movie is an old man who runs an antique shop stocked with amazing treasures, including a magnificient porcelain figurine ""the baron"" (also featured in ""The cat returns). Both of these characters play an important role in the film. Though ""The cat returns"" is kind of follow up to ""whisper"" yet for some reason it was released on dvd before ""whisper"".

Rarely is a film as honest and realistic as whisper of the heart and that's what makes it amazingly special, charming and successful. Within its thin plot and realistic settings, whisper has its magic moments which are downright uplifting and strike a chord somewhere deep inside. The film itself is a breath of fresh air.

Whisper of the heart, though slow in pace, draws you in from the very beginning and refuses to let you go. Its a heartwarming tale which makes you feel nostalgic and helps you relive the adolescence. Except for the Shizuku's dreamy fantasy sequence, the film relies heavily on dialogues and simple and real situations. The locales and the backgrounds shown in the film are as beautiful and breathtaking as in any other ghibli film. Open spaces, beautiful countryside, deep blue sky with summer clouds, a bicycle ride atop the hill, there are numerous things and moments in the film that set the mood just right, leaving the viewer spellbound and satisfied. After a while you forget completely that you are watching an animated film. Music plays an important role in the film and is soft and relaxing though we do get lots of those silent moments too for which ghibli films are famous. Also featured in the film is John Denver's song ""country roads"" which makes the perfect backdrop for the film. Not to mention here, the royalty disputes which arised later, making it difficult for the movie to see an American release.

Be it character development, animation or background art of the film, attention to details is simply stunning. The incredibly detailed backgrounds of the fantasy sequences were done by Naohisa Inoue who was an established artist and a long time Miyazaki fan. Impressed by his fantasy work, Miyazaki himself invited him to work on the film. Whisper of the heart dvd released by Buena Vista in Japan includes a special documentary showcasing the dreamy artwork of the film.

Director Yoshifumi Kondo had worked on many ghibli films such as Kiki's delivery service, Grave of the fireflies and Pom poko etc, as an animator. Hayao Miyazaki, who was looking for new breed of directors for ghibli, recognised Kondo's talent in no time and gave him a chance to direct this movie. Unfortunately, whisper of the heart remains to be the first and the only film directed by Yoshifumi Kondo. Just after the release of whisper, Kondo succumbed to aneurysm. It is evident from whisper of the heart how immensely talented and sensitive director Kondo was.

Films like whisper of the heart are very rare and come once in a lifetime. Watching a film like this is an experience to behold and cherish forever.

  ----Blu-ray RELEASE UPDATE----

Whisper of the Heart finally makes it to North America on the stellar format. The film is reported to have received a shiny new digital 1080P remaster for this Blu-ray release which will also feature English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French 2.0 Dolby Digital Language Track, Japanese 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Original Production, English and French Subtitles.

2458481,5,B000CDGVOO,"I'm a middle school art teacher that concentrates on teaching beginning animation. I have to say, that this gem of a movie Whispers Of The Heart, is without a doubt one the best Anime I've ever seen. The plot is sweet romance and coming of age mixed in with middle school drama and other enticing story telling peripherals, that do not disappoint. I show this movie to all my animation classes both for it story telling prowess and for the beautiful graphics. This anime is a masterpiece in combining a compelling story with exquisite animation. Middle school students reaction to this movie is always positive and they're always hungry for more. I love Whispers Of The Heart because it feels like it was written by a writer for writers.

Good family entertainment that was not rude, vulgar, sexual, or any other sort of content that made it challenging to watch with children. This one is best when viewed prior to watching The Cat Returns as they seem to follow one another. My kids love Studio Ghibli films. They are consistently high quality and very interesting fantasy worlds where there are positive and responsible lessons to learn in an enjoyable way. Thank you.",1500681600,,514,4.8522727272727275

2458512,4,B000CDGVOO,"This is a pleasant movie. My two sons (aged 2 and 5) both LOVE ""My Neighbor Totoro"" (as do I). We have been going through the Ghibli films this summer. After ""Spirited Away,"" ""Kiki's Delivery Service,"" ""Ponyo,"" and ""Howl's Moving Castle,"" we tried this one. The plot is somewhat boring, and the visuals are obviously nothing like the others we've seen. Compared to those, it's a bit colorless and slow. This is set in the real world with very little magic compared to the other movies mentioned.

But the characters are sweet, and the nuanced facial expressions and non-verbal communication makes it one you can watch again and again and find something new to love every time. If you think of yourself as an artist and are interested in stories about artists' struggles, this is a good one.

My 2-yr-old loves watching the cat navigate the city and the trains all on his own. He thinks it's hilarious. My 5-yr-old is too young to understand the teenage romance parts, so he has little use for this movie! But I like it.",1497398400,8,1019,4.624309392265193

2458524,3,B000CDGVOO,"Unfortunately this film was not as good as I remembered. I loved it the first time I saw it, but having watched it a couple times now that I'm older, the story and dialog are nothing special and don't elicit much reaction anymore. The voice work in both the dub and subtitled versions is fairly standard and not on par with some of Ghibli's better productions.

""The Cat Returns"" is one of seven or so Studio Ghibli films that in my opinion are must own and earn the studio the well deserved reputation of being the Disney/Pixar of the East. ""Whisper of the Heart"" is not that sort of blockbuster. It is the heartwarming story of young love that develops between a pair of normal Japanese teens living in a typical real world Japanese city with just a hint of fantasy (which led to the sequel). My son that went as a high school exchange student for a summer in Japan adored this film. It gives a sense of what real Japan was like to him.

It definitely lacks the intensity of the other films I've seen from Miyasaki and falls more on the Totoro spectrum of being a simple, sweet story. There are moments that the storyline alludes to an impending tragedy or for things to take a negative turn, but this movie has a happy ending, I promise.

Pretty realistic teenage ""coming of age"" and romance at its bestWhisper of the Heart is endearing and funny with all of the sweet, capturing elements Studio Ghibli does so well.",1476057600,4,583,4.715686274509804

2458565,4,B000CDGVOO,"A lesser known work from the legendary Studio Ghibli, but one that sits comfortably within their treasured filmography. Whisper of the Heart is a gentle and warm coming-of-age tale in the spirit of Kiki's Delivery Service, but without the fantastical elements and with a romantic spin.

The themes of the film are quite traditional for the genre: the childhood struggle of finding your own voice, building confidence, balancing your dreams with reality and the challenges of school, and the first sparks of attraction. Our lead, Shizuku, follows the Miyazaki (who wrote the screenplay for the film but did not direct it) tradition of strong yet endearingly-flawed female protagonists. She is an intelligent middle schooler with a passion for reading and writing, but who is easily distracted, forgetful, and, like any child her age, lacking in confidence.

We follow her through the film as she struggles to find her own path, which eventually leads her to Seiji, a boy from her class and a kindred spirit. Although there is a clear romantic element between the two that builds as the film progresses, the element is underplayed and is secondary to how the two inspire one another to challenge themselves and to follow their dreams, even if it may lead them down a non-traditional path. The film does a really excellent job of mining the tension between your dreams and the realities and responsibilities of life, and Shizuku and Seiji ultimately learn that they must find a balance between the two.

I appreciated that the film retained a feeling of realism and never veered into fairy-tale territory, other than perhaps the last few minutes which just barely crossed the line into melodrama. Save for the ending though, Whisper of the Heart is a wonderfully restrained film that is packed with the trademark Ghibli charm. There are no evil villains, manufactured dramatics, or high stakes like we see with so many Disney films - just a couple of kids facing the challenges and rewards of everyday life.",1461542400,,2004,4.994011976047904

2458569,5,B000CDGVOO,"Absolutely one of my favorite movies. It's, effectively, a love and a life story and revels a bit in the 'normalness' of it. It's very different from most Ghibli movies, and worth every dime one might spend on it. Believe me, if you're a fan of quality, this is worth it.",1458950400,,271,4.333333333333333
2458570,5,B000CDGVOO,"I am a big Hayao Miyazaki fan (Spirited Away is one of my favorite movies of all time), and I thrive on his work- the look, the atmosphere, the ""heart"" of his characters.  Note that I watched this in Japanese with English subtitles (not English captions for the hearing impaired, that's the American reworking of the dialogue).  As an aside I cannot bear what Disney/Americans do to Miyazaki dialogue, ruin it every time (for me, anyway).  But it's possible the English-dialogue version was somewhat better (I very much doubt it).  I purchased the DVD to complete my Miyazaki collection.  I love the look, the sound, the essential purity and goodness of Miyazaki's films, so after I got used to the fact that it wasn't a particularly magical or metaphysical film, like Spirited Away, I delighted in it (after several viewings).  It's quiet, episodic, full of small happenings with big import.

***SPOILER ALERT*** There's gorgeous animation, atmospheric music, magical thinking, a mysterious cat, memorable people (e.g., an old craftsman), an interesting family dynamic, a sense that some things are preordained, and the oriental sensibility of the universe being animistic, alive- all very subtle.  Will she study for exams or go to the library and check out extracurricular books?  Does she like an enigmatic boy she keeps seeing around?  Who does this strange cat belong to?  The film is strikingly beautiful.  I reveled in Shizuku's quest for meaning and purpose in life, in the notion of a young girl seeking a test (a la A Man Called Horse, perhaps) of her mettle, her abilities, along with her strength of character (it's subtle and underplayed though).

This has mostly to do with the inner life of a junior high school girl, and I think that girls of that age and younger may find it interesting and appealing but wonder if boys and men, or older girls and women will.  Unless you are ultra-sensitive and revel in slow-moving, episodic films, thrive on eye candy, and are especially moved by a young girl being treated as very important in the scheme of things, you might rent it or watch it online before buying.  I liked it better with each viewing.  I also recommend Spirited Away or Song of the Sea, both splendid in every way.

P.S. I read other reviews after writing this, and many of the negative ones comment on disrespect towards parents and adults- there is NONE of that in the Japanese language version with English subtitles.",1458691200,2,2446,4.869565217391305

2458603,5,B000CDGVOO,"Shizuku (Brittany Snow) is a junior high school student who lives in Tokyo in a cramped apartment with her parents and older sister. Everyone seems to be busy. Her father (James Sikking) is a busy librarian, her mother (Jean Smart) is pursuing a master's degree, and her sister (Courtney Thorne-Smith) is a working university student. Shizuku herself is an avid reader that is supposed to be studying for her high school entrance exams with the hope of getting into a good school. But she notices that every book she checks out from the library has already been checked out by one Seiji Amasawa (David Gallagher). She starts to wonder who this person might be. Meanwhile, she and her friend, Yuko (Ashley Tisdale), are starting to get interested in boys and love.

Since I have just recently been introduced to the works of Studio Ghibli, I checked out this film mostly on a whim based on little more than the Ghibli name. I was not disappointed. Although this film lacks the fantasy elements of many other Ghibli works, it is nothing short of the top quality one would expect from Ghibli. The animation does a great job of bringing to life the urban environment of outer Tokyo. But the real heart of this movie is the story and characters. I thought the characters in this movie were great and realistic. The way the film depicts the life of teenagers is very grounded in reality as the main character, Shizuku, lives her life, gets through school, deals with a budding romance, all while trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life. The way she and her friends act is not like what you might see in other movies where young people sometimes act with wisdom beyond their years. She constantly wonders if she is good enough and second guesses her decisions.

I found this to be a lovely movie that is sure to be enjoyed by anyone who likes animation or a realistic depiction of young teenage life. It may not usually top the lists of everyone's favorite Ghibli film, but it is one of their usual quality works.",1443744000,,2022,4.598337950138504

Now as I usually say for Ghibli films, I HIGHLY  recommend you watch the original Japanese version. But especially this one. English dub is horrendous. The ending enraged me. They trivialized their commitment to each other.  I know know they are middle schoolers but they believe what they feel is real.  That's  how kids are, but writing it off as ""is this corny?"" you make it corny. Commit to the dialogue and conviction of the characters, please, when you dub!!! Also the girl's voice was cringe worthy.

Most of her books come from the school library, and she discovers many have been read by the same person. This causes her to begin wondering who shares her interests.

2458706,2,B000CDGVOO,"First off, I had high expectations on this movie. I'm new to the Studio Ghibli films, so maybe a fan would hit me upside the head for this review. The Studio Ghibli films I HAVE seen are The Secret World of Arrietty, Grave of the Fireflies (GREAT, but REALLY depressing!), and, my favorite, From Up On Poppy Hill. I loved all of them, and this movie sounded truly charming and the reviews I read really promoted that impression. But it...wasn't.

The heroine (Shizuku) was dreadful. She was extremely disrespectful, a bit whiney, and just stupid. She saw a cat taking the subway and started talking to it (I can't judge her there, for I have a deaf dog and I talk to him sometimes--who DOESN'T speak to their pets?), but she talked and talked to it. I was expecting something magical to happen, like the cat answering her back and leading her to many adventures. It never happened. It was just a stray cat. He got off at her stop and ran away. What did she do? She ran all over the city looking for it, and finding it, continued talking to it. I could go on, but I'll spare you. You probably have things to do. As for disrespect, her parents would tell her to take the trash out or do the dishes and she'd turn around, say ""No!"" and stomp to her room and slam the door.

The film itself was a bore. It was basically her going to school, walking home, talking to the stupid cat, disrespecting her parents, and occasionally talking to a guy (Seiji), who for some reason has had a crush on her for years. That's it. Rinse and repeat. Near the end she attempted to write a book, and that was as exciting as it got. The best part of the movie was Seiji, who got a smile out of me with his witty comments. But those comments made Shizuku mad, and she got even more obnoxious.  There were no magical elements, no adventure, just the everyday life of a 14 year old teenager. It was very, very boring and painful to watch. I kept watching, however, hoping it would get better and when it ended I just sat there, thinking I just wasted 2 hours of my life. 2 hours that I'll never get back.

Obviously, my advice to you would be to skip this movie....If you want to bore your kids to sleep, then it's perfect, I suppose. But I wouldn't inflict it upon anyone. Do yourself a favor and spend $20 on something worth your time.",1389225600,,2312,4.295871559633028

2458708,5,B000CDGVOO,"Over the past three weeks, I've watched this movie seven times.  I empathize with the leading character Shizuku who is looking for her direction in life.  I think that she is a little too obsessive about finding her way, but that is because she is young and she is comparing herself to another person who knows what he wants.  Also she is Japanese and her parents and her society put pressure on her to excel.  This movie is a window into what it is like to grow up in Japan.  I would recommend this movie to anybody who wants to learn more about life and life in Japan, especially young people.  This movie is also about young romance.  The John Denver song ""Take me home, Country Road"" is a major musical motif in this movie.  I was very surprised to hear this song on a movie from Japan.  Apparently the Japanese liked the song too.",1389052800,2,835,4.335483870967742

2458711,4,B000CDGVOO,The animation is as amazing as anything you would expect from Studio Ghibli. They always choose the right talent for the English voice over's so i'm never disappointed on that front but it seems that there was still a bit of a loose thread to the story.

2458712,5,B000CDGVOO,"not a miyazaki one but by his studio a long time ago. a gentle love story between 2 teenage kids trying their hardest to find their own path in life. warm, touching, magical... i've watched this dozens of times and it remains refreshing each time.

highly highly recommend even if not miyazaki",1384819200,,293,4.634615384615385
2458713,3,B000CDGVOO,"A rating of 3 stars is perhaps harsh but I am judging it next to the films Directed by Hayao Miyazaki which are truly magical. ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", ""Ponyo"" and ""Howl's Moving Castle"" are cute but brave and poignant allegories while ""Princess Mononoke"", ""Nausica of the Valley of the Wind"" and ""Spirited Away"" are epic tales with more than a hint of darkness, and with that a vivid journey comes to life for both the characters of the films and for the viewer. These are qualities ""Whisper of the Heart"" lack. If you want more of a cute film this is for you. But see it in the japanese version, the english language is not very good.

I bought this dvd because of the great reviews saying it equals Miyazaki, which I obviously find not to be true. It is a nice movie but if you haven't seen any of the ones I mention above, I recommend to see them first. Chances are you'll see them more than once.",1383868800,,903,4.34319526627219

2458717,5,B000CDGVOO,"Raymond Chandler believed that there are no dull stories, only dull minds. Before Pixar came along and explored the possibilities of the animated medium in storytelling, Hayao Miyazaki had already done so through Studio Ghibli, producing such engaging, fully fleshed out stories such as Castle in the Sky, My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, Grave of the Fireflies, and Only Yesterday. Months before Pixar released its first feature film Toy Story, Studio Ghibli had released Whispers of the Heart, the story of a girl who is in the cusp of change, who is figuring out who she is and what she wants to become, and in the process slowly gaining confidence in herself and also discovering the feelings of romantic love for the first time.

Everything about the film has been treated lovingly: the animation including its palette of colors, the artful rendering of the industrialization of Japan, the subtle difference of the strokes of light between dusk and dawn, the splatter of rain on the pavement, and even the wind that ripples along the riverbank. Such honesty is commendable; the story is meditative, raises questions about predestination, of consequences to personal choices, of taking the path less traveled. For someone like me who has often wondered what to make of my life, such a story is very appealing.",1382745600,,1325,5.050228310502283
2458718,5,B000CDGVOO,"The movie arrived very quickly and in perfect condition. I'm very happy!

2458720,5,B000CDGVOO,"I'm a huge Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli fan, and I own almost every title (blu-ray is amazing for their films). I was actually ordering Ponyo for my friend, and this title popped up in my quick picks.

I didn't even read the description, I just bought it! Not knowing anything about the title, I was pleased to find out it's the predecessor to the Cat Returns (which I also love). Whisper of the Heart is both endearing and touching. It's proof that there is beauty in everyday life and trials. Add a bit of childhood first love, and you have a classic. So glad this one is in my library!",1379462400,2,592,4.333333333333333
2458721,5,B000CDGVOO,"Wow. It has been a while since I saw this movie but I am so glad I bought the Blu-Ray. The HD transfer is absolutely amazing. And the story is so engaging - a girl who is not sure what she want to do with her life and is drifting in school meets a boy who knows that he want to do and works at realizing his dream. This causes the girl to push herself to see if she can be what she has previously only played at. This story can speak to anyone who is unsure of what they want to do with their lives.

And this Blur_ray package does not disappoint. As I already mentioned the HD transfer is wonderful. There is a DVD copy (handy for soccer Moms and Dads who need to keep the rugrats occupied for long trips in the family van), multiple commentaries, subtitles and languages. There is even even the English subtitle of the Japanese audio, as well as the English subtitle of the English audio. A perfect 5 stars!",1377216000,,909,4.135593220338983
2458722,5,B000CDGVOO,"Whisper of the Heart tells the story of a girl named Shizuku who is an avid reader and upon noticing all the tags on her books, realizes they had all been checked out by a boy named Seiji Amasawa. Shizuku is very imaginative and she can't help but wonder what type of person Seiji is, although, when she does meet him, he's not really what she expects (In my opinion, he's my favorite type of character so I wouldn't have minded).

Upon meeting Seiji, Shizuko begins thinking of her future and decides to take action in trying to pursue her it.

I think that this film is amazing for the fact that it is so relatable for any person worried about the future and also their personal life. This film inspires hope that we can become what we wish and that hard work and passion will allow us to find our personal happiness.

2458732,5,B000CDGVOO,"This is my favorite film of them all.  Many people don't like it because it is one of Studio Ghibli's ""non-magical"" films, in that it takes place in present day (ok, early 90s technically), and the magical sequences are really just the girl's imagination and somewhat corny coincidences. That's what makes it interesting to me though. This film shows a magic in the ordinary, and shows us a modern girl trying to discover herself without losing touch with the magic she still believes exists in the world.",1372723200,,505,4.804597701149425
2458733,5,B000CDGVOO,"Who is Whisper of the Heart aimed at? It's animated, so it must be for children? The lead characters are young teens and there's a strong romantic element, so is it aimed at teens? I'm a 51-year-old man who doesn't have any children, but I love every minute of this film.

If you are a fan of Studio Ghibli, you'll know that Hayao Miyazaki has directed most of the studio's work. Yoshifumi Kondo directed this time, but Miyazaki wrote the screenplay, and his influence can be felt rather than seen. Whisper of the Heart is set in the real world and only contains the tiniest of fantasy references. It's a coming-of-age tale that just about everyone can identify with. Even if you are not a child, a teen, or a parent, you will remember living through similar moments to those depicted in this story.

Shizuku is a 14-year-old girl who focuses most of her attention on school, reading, and studying. One day, she notices that almost every book she borrows from the library has previously been checked out by Seiji Amasawa. She becomes curious about him, and wonders how someone could have such similar tastes to her own. At school, she's a good student, and goes through the typical things that most young girls experience. She talks to her girlfriends about boys, but writing is her real passion. She impresses her friends by writing song lyrics.

Her life changes when she encounters a cat on the train, and she follows it after it gets off at her stop. It leads her to an antiques store, owned by an old man. The man turns out to be the grandfather of the mysterious Seiji, and the two finally meet.

Although Shizuki studies hard, she has little idea of what she wants to do with her life. Seiji and his grandfather provide the inspiration she has been lacking, and she soon realizes that her true passion in life is writing. Seiji's passion is making violins, and the old man spends his time restoring antiques. This new focus means that her studies start to suffer, and she has to decide whether her writing is more important to her.

That sounds like a boring story, but it's nothing of the sort. There are no villains, no explosions, and not a lot of humor, but it's a sweet story with real characters that are easy to like and care about. You might find yourself remembering key moments in your own childhood, or perhaps wondering how different your life would have been if you had chosen a different path.

The film includes well-developed relationships with friends, parents, and siblings. Shizuku's parents are supportive, but realistic about their daughter's choices. There's a lot of respect present in her relationships with family, and the other people in her life. In typical Studio Ghibli fashion, Miyazaki's script includes many instances where characters stop and reflect on their actions. The animation includes little touches which add to the realism. For example, how many animated movies take the time to show someone using a vacuum cleaner?

The story is so realistic that I could imagine it having a positive influence on young teens or even parents. The messages are all positive, and they fit well with the story. My favorite Studio Ghibli films do include strong fantasy elements, but Whisper of the Heart is close to perfect while remaining firmly in the real world. These events could actually happen. It reminds me that Miyazaki must be a keen observer of human nature.

I've seen the film several times, and it always reaches me emotionally. The themes are simple and universal. I urge you to give it a try, even if you think that the genre isn't something you would normally enjoy. It's one for the whole family. If you do end up loving Whisper of the Heart, one of the characters also appears in The Cat Returns, and that's well worth your time as well.

The Blu-ray presentation is pleasing, but don't expect the film to look like something from Pixar. This is the intended look.

2458744,5,B000CDGVOO,"Whisper of the Heart is a 1995 Studio Ghibli film and the only film to be directed by Yoshifumi Kondo before his untimely death. Slated to be both Miyazki's and Takahata's successor, Kondo shows his skill as he successfully lives up to his would-be title. Whisper of the Heart is a fun and light-hearted coming-of-age story that has you smiling from start to finish. The film does a great job of making you love all of the characters, cheering them on each step of the way.

Shizuku Tsukisma is a junior high school student who does what most girls her age do. She reads books in her spare time, talks about boys with her best friend, and spends most of her time making up songs, or adapting them from older westerns and singing them (These are things normal girls do...right?). The whole film revolves around the old John Denver song ""Take me Home, Country Roads,"" and throughout the film Shizuku is trying to adapt the lyrics to help express her feelings for her junior high graduation.

Shizuku also reads a lot and as a result of this, checks out many books from the library. Eventually, she starts to notice a pattern in the books she checks out: the have all been checked out by the same person before her. This sends Shizuku in search for the seemingly elusive Seiji Amasawa, and sets the story for our film.

In May 2012, the North American blu-ray version of Whisper of the Heart was released alongside Castle in the Sky and the Secret World of Arrietty. The movie came shipped from Amazon in great condition, along with the sleeve cover (no bends or tears, the movie was shipped in a box with giant bubble wrap). Inside the packaging you have your standard bluray on one side, DVD on the other, as well as paperwork for a code to Disney Movie Rewards (something I would HIGHLY recommend you start taking advantage of. Signing up is free, and if you buy enough Disney movies, you might as well reap the full the benefits, especially at 35+ bucks a pop, MSRP).

The English dub of Whisper of the Heart is one of the best I've heard and is just as enjoyable as the original audio to me. If you are, however, a stickler for the Japanese audio, the good thing about this release is that it comes with both a verbatim subtitle track of the English version, as well as the original translation subtitle track, so you get to choose.

The only thing that I had a real problem with was the cover art. The Japanese releases on these films got way cooler, exclusive artwork, which would have been great, but of course that's not how these things go. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase, and I'm glad I own this timeless classic. I give the film a 5/5.

Good luck getting Country Road out of your head! It'll be stuck in there for days after each time you watch this film.",1369958400,8,2777,4.456692913385827
2458745,5,B000CDGVOO,"Nothing disturbing, distressing, immoral, or weird in this movie.  Just a classically simple tale of one of the phases of transition from childhood to adulthood.  Personally, I thought this was one of the best written movies ever because it focused on the characters and the dialogue rather than special effects and the shock factor.

Definitely recommend it! May not hold young boys attention, but girls (young, teenage, and adult) will enjoy this simple romance.

Note: If you don't mind reading subtitles, I personally think the Japanese voice actors were exponentially better than the American actors. They were much more emotional, convincing, and their voices sounded more age appropriate for the characters.",1369440000,2,714,5.405405405405405

2458748,5,B000CDGVOO,"A lot of people gave low rating to this movie because they thought it was going to be more like Kiki's Delivery Service or Princess Mononoke. This just happens to be one of many Studio Ghibli classics with non-fantasy stories (like Grave of the Fireflies, I can Hear the Sea and only Yesterday). I really love this charming and endearing movie because of the message of finding oneself and believing in oneself. It is the only Ghibli movie so far to have a spin-off movie made from it: The Cat Returns (also love that movie!)

I prefer the Japanese language version to the English dub, but that's just how I like to watch anime. The American voice cast did a really good job, too. I really love that there are two different set of subtitles in English. One that matches the Japanese language version, and one that matches the English dub version.

The Blu-Ray is clear and crisp and the sound is perfect. So many details in the old man's shop are now visible. Did you see the words ""Porco Rosso"" on the clock?",1368403200,4,1009,4.478260869565218

2458762,5,B000CDGVOO,"I've had the DVD version for a number of years and seeing the blu-ray version was like watching the movie again for the first time. Images are sharp and crisp. While the colors have largely been untouched and appear somewhat flat compared to today's standards, over-saturated images can quickly tire the eyes, so I believe it's best to use one's imagination to fill in the colors. Also, this was the way the film appeared back in 1995, so the muted colors convey a sort of nostalgia for the 90s, remaining unaltered and faithful to its heritage.

What makes this anime a gem is that it takes a non-traditional approach. While Whisper of the Heart has a main protagonist, Shizuku, it doesn't have an antagonist. The conflict is unclear at the start, but develops steadily into one I believe we can all relate to: the need to have a direction in life. We are given a very intimate portrait of Shizuku's life. Her ups and downs. The things she wants to accomplish. The fact that she endeavors to do what she wants, yet feels awfully insecure are what make her such a real, genuine character.

What I love about this film is that every character contributes to the overall message of the movie. Their experiences, past and present, foreshadow the important decisions Shizuku will have to make for herself. The level of detail is simply amazing, from the depiction of life in Tokyo to the changes in Shizuku's room as time goes on. I feel that this review is very much incomplete, as there is so many good things to write, but I will leave the rest to you. I highly recommend this anime.",1359072000,3,1582,4.586572438162544

2458779,5,B000CDGVOO,"Studio Ghibli's 'Whisper of the Heart' is a poignant masterpiece that captures all the highs and lows of being a teenager. Shizuku Tsukishima is a girl who loves fairy tales and reading more than she does studying for school. She has her friends and a good relationship with her family - as good as it gets for any teenager. She also finds herself intrigued by Seiji Amasawa, someone who keeps checking out all the same books that she checks out. She wonders who he is. At the same time she keeps being annoyed by a tall, good-looking young man. And you can probably see where that is headed . . .

Whisper of the Heart follows Shiziku as she struggles with her life. What does she want to do in life? And will she be any good at it? Helping her along the path is a cat. A cat you say? Yes, a cat. For the cat leads her to an antique shop and a kindly older gentleman who helps Shiziku with her dreams. And it just so happens that this man is grandfather to Seiji, who himself struggles with dreams of becoming a violin maker.

The movie is beautifully rendered and as in all Studio Ghibli films, the characters and the story both shine. Whisper of the Heart is a truly magical film that will leave you smiling and that will touch your heart.",1351987200,,1242,4.280851063829787

I was captivated right from the word 'go'. The animation is excellent; the blu-ray transfer is first-class; you would hardly guess the movie was made in 1995 - it looks (and sounds) very fresh; no complaints there!

The story revolves around high-school girl Shizuku Tsukishima, who wants to be a writer (the name 'Whisper of the Heart' or 'Mimi o Sumaseba', lit. ""If you listen closely"", is the title of a story she is writing), and her school friends in Tokyo in 1994. Then, the mysterious Seiji Amasawa comes on the scene, initially through his name appearing on many of the library tickets in books Shizuku gets out of the library (her dad is a librarian); she is fascinated and decides to find out more... I won't say any more, so as not to spoil the story, but I would heartily recommend this movie, it is absolutely superb; I would place it in my top 10 favourite movies of all time; it is that good. I felt really good and moved by the end of the story, and the 'feel-good' factor will stay with you.

2458783,5,B000CDGVOO,"Yes, this is by far my favorite Studio Ghibli title. ""Better than the works of Miyazaki? Blasphemy!"" I hear you cry, but in this story I find more to emotionally connect to than any other Ghibli film.

The plot follows a girl named Shizuku. She's an avid reader and often picks up books from the library. One day she begins to notice a trend in her books though, they've all been previously checked out by the same person: 'Seiji Amasawa'. Later she meets a young man who annoys her to no end... and well, you can probably see where the plot's going from here. What makes it interesting though is the storytelling device of... well, stories. To put it simply Shizuku is a girl who doesn't know where she's going in her life, what she wants to do when she grows up. Through the process of meeting the young man and his grandfather, she ends up thinking about stories and one she would like to tell based off a cat figurine in Seiji's grandfather's house.(The figurine, called the Barron would become so popular in Japan that he would get his own spinoff movie called The Cat Returns. It's much more in line with Ghibli's usual magical world type films).

Unlike Ghibli's other titles, Whisper of the Heart is a pure, unadulterated coming-of-age story. No gimmicks, very little embellishment, and very little in terms of flights of fancy. There is no magic creatures in this one that will change the lives of the characters. Any magic that comes about is made by the character's own thoughts and imagination. If I was to compare it to another of their movies I would have to say Grave of Fireflies... though nowhere near as depressing.

Despite its G rating, I don't honestly think this is a kid's movie. There's nothing really objectionable in it, I just doubt it would hold their interest. It's a slow paced and thoughtful movie. This seems to be a film made for young adults, people who are almost finished with Highschool or going off to college. It's a movie about deciding what you want to do with your life, and where you will go. That's not to say that you won't enjoy it if that's not where you are in your life, far from it. It just seems like it would have more emotional resonance with that group.

Sadly, this was the only film directed by Yoshifumi Kondo who died only a few years after the film was completed. After watching this, I can only wonder what he would have gone on to do if he would have had more time.

From a technical standpoint this blu-ray is beautiful. While it is not the most colorful animated film, containing very few flashy scenes and a rather minimal color palate, it comes off looking something like a spring day. Just enough color to get feelings across, and always beautiful to look at.",1347235200,,2725,4.530487804878049
2458784,5,B000CDGVOO,"If Jane Austen had served as the muse for this film, it wouldn't surprise me in the least.  The movie has many elements that seem to pull almost directly from Pride and Prejudice (so if you like this film, give Jane a chance!).

By rights, this version of the movie probably only deserves 4 stars for some quality issues, but the story more than makes up for such defects.

We are spoiled by Miyazaki's influence in films and all their glorious splendor.  This movie rings very much of him, especially in very subtle ways.  The detailed, realistic backdrops are really elegant and vibrant, as we have come to expect with anything related to Hiyao Miyazaki.  Scattered throughout the film are some little things that most movies wouldn't include but which are subtly thought-provoking:  little detailed things like the items in the antique shop; Shizuku having to expend a little annoying effort to turn off the lamp; the way Shizuku seems to find it hard to stay annoyed for any length of time (moral/ethical insinuation here?); the prisoner making a violin picture that Shizuku cherishes; the kindness of Shizuku's father to the neighbor on the stairs before he finds Shizuku arguing with her older sister; Seiji's protectiveness of Shizuku with his bicycle when a car drives past in the dark; the decided lack of safe walking space in Tokyo, etc.

Some detractors:
- Particularly noticeable in the earliest parts of the film, before suspension of disbelief sucks you into this heart-warming world, is the low number of cells per second.  The backgrounds look great, but the animated portions are jerky, particularly with Shizuku, BUT this seems to improve as the film progresses (or, as I said, I just am too engrossed to notice).
- The English language dubbing could have been a bit better.  The voice of Seiji is done by David Gallagher.  While I think the voice itself seems to be a good match, there are some points where his tone isn't really in sync with the expression or meaning of the words.  There are one or two moments with Brittany Snow's speaking for Shizuku that I would tweak if I could, but those were tolerable, and for the most part, she did an excellent job.  I feel overall they could have worked just a little harder on some of the dubbing to get it more accurate--if only the very last words of the film by Seiji so that the mouth and character expression matched the audio!
- As some other reviewers have said, this isn't quite so fanciful as other Miyazaki films, and what is there is meant to be raw and juvenile, which can make a seasoned fan wince a little.  But overall, that's the intent, so it can't really be held as a flaw, right?
- Over-use of theme of separated lovers:  Shizuku and Seiji, Mr. Nishi and Louise, Baron and Baroness, dwarf king and fairy/sheep and clockmaker...WE GET IT.  The only relief we seem to get from this crushing theme is with Yuko and her dramas and Shizuku's own family pseudo-dramas.

However, as an avid Jane Austen fan, as well as a Miyazaki fan, I imagine this movie as a beautiful blend between Pride and Prejudice, Romeo & Juliet, and mid-90s Japan.  Some things I love in this film:

- The complexity of characters is wonderful.  Each character has depth.  All of them have flaws, many of which they share in common, and the interplay of these flaws makes for a very rich demonstration of Life.
- What could be more romantic than Seiji's line in the library, telling Shizuku to keep on working, that he'll wait?  It kills me that some alleged teenager can have such a selfless, loving spirit.
- There are no sloppy makeouts.  In fact, no makeouts of any kind!  No ""fan service"", just age-appropriate romance and sweetness.
- The reminder/push for children to be helpful members of their families.  Shiho is this great demonstrator of what a helpful daughter can be, and I hope my 4yo son is taking notes!
- The theme song interplay.  You'd think a song would get overdone by being in a film so often, but it's fresh each time, and I find myself cheerfully singing along in my head for hours after watching this.

I may be a little hormonal right now or something, but seriously, I've enjoyed this film so much that I've been watching it twice a day for the past 4 days.

Anyway, the main gist is that if you are looking to just look at a hunk of Miyazaki art, there are portions in this film that will appeal, but much will fail to satisfy you if that is all you seek.  However, if you are looking for a rich movie with great character balance and an emphasis on feminism, eco-friendliness, and no dichotomous ""good vs. evil"", which are also hallmarks of Miyazaki influence, then please, buy Whisper of the Heart and watch it.  I love it!

What I liked the best, or should perhaps say loved, was her version of the lyrics to the 'American' song ""Country Roads"" by John Denver. Her version of those concrete roads of Tokyo was excellent IMO, left me wanting a couple more verses for that chorus.

Very good coming of age storyline with the wandering cat that led her to all that followed, chiefly that name found in all her books.

2458789,4,B000CDGVOO,"Many a long year has passed since a movie impressed, charmed, and touched me like _Whisper of the Heart_. Those with preconceptions about anime might be surprised to discover that this is not primarily a comedy or an action-filled melodrama but a finely detailed, believable portrait of modern junior high school students in Japan, with all the ambitions and insecurities, the longings for adventure and for love, that young teens almost anywhere might feel. In fact, it brings to mind a coming-of-age television series called _The Wonder Years_.

In _Whisper of the Heart_ the protagonist is a winsome, vaguely self-effacing girl named Shizuku--a bookworm whose encounters with a mysterious cat, an old man, and a boy with hidden talents prompt her to discover her own undeveloped gift for writing. The occasional insertion of a brief dream sequence lends an extra element of fantasy and visual variety to a strikingly beautiful movie.

Such were my initial reactions to _Whisper of the Heart_ as dubbed into English by the Disney studio. The DVD edition, however, provides other choices: watching the film as it was first released in Japanese (with or without English subtitles) or even viewing the original storyboards--more than a thousand pencil sketches by Hayao Miyazaki, which flash by in synch with the soundtrack of your choice.

The Disney dubbing emerges as a characteristically slick feel-good movie. The infusion of American slang is reasonably effective, the voiceover acting even more so (with a few exceptions), and the surround-sound audio mix more elaborate than in the Japanese version. In some scenes, the dubbed version actually has more dialog than the original, as characters keep talking when their faces are turned away from us. The moralizing is perhaps more explicit than in the original--the message that students need to study hard, just as artists need to labor at their craft--yet it is inspirationally presented. Though many visible details reflect Japanese culture, young viewers could easily forget that they were watching a foreign picture.

There is one distasteful moment in English where Shizuku calls the cat a rather vulgar name that has no equivalent in the Japanese script (most parents will not object to the word, but it would not pass muster in my classroom). Even more cringeworthy is the line where Cary Elwes--who is supposed to play a supernaturally wise, urbane, gentlemanly character--unintelligently mispronounces ""lapis lazuli."" The gaffe is all the more obvious since at the end of the previous scene, a few seconds earlier, Harold Gould pronounced the term correctly. Speaking of gaffes: David Gallagher mispronounces his own character's name; at best, he Americanizes ""Seiji Amasawa"" in a way that no other cast member does.

Early in the film, a significant plot point involves Shizuku writing new lyrics to the John Denver song ""Country Roads."" Watching in English, we can't help wondering why the student is rewriting the song for her middle school graduation (but months ahead of time). Her version--to the extent that we can make out the words--has nothing to do with graduation, nor does it sound like remotely capable writing. In the original film, it makes sense that Shizuku is adapting the American song into Japanese and, in the process, making a poetic statement about life as a lonely and uncertain road.

What no one seems to have noticed is that the Japanese and American editions have startlingly different plot resolutions. By modifying and adding just a couple lines of dialog, the Disney team have given us a satisfyingly predictable Hollywood happy ending (details under ""Spoiler Alert"" below). The Japanese ending is more bittersweet and potentially more haunting. Which one best fits the story becomes practically a litmus test of viewer preference and personality.

And just when I would like to say ""Skip the Disney dub and watch the film with subtitles,"" it turns out that the DVD spoils the Japanese version (and not the dubbed one) by cropping off the top of the image during the entire epilogue, which is wordlessly played out during the closing credits. The viewer is simply unable to see the final interaction between the young heroine's friends Yuko and Sugimura.

A sufficiently dedicated viewer might watch the film in Japanese and then watch the closing credits of the dubbed version. Unfortunately, finding the credits requires using both a chapter stop and a fast-forward button. The film is indeed a heartwarming and visually impressive masterpiece, but unless the recent Blu-Ray release has corrected the problem with the Japanese credits, an ideal DVD edition has yet to appear.

SPOILER ALERT: In the Disney adaptation, handsome young Seiji ultimately returns from Cremona, Italy, eager to explain that his mentor has pronounced him a potentially gifted violinmaker who will still need years of practice. Being sensible as well as sentimental, Seiji has realized that he really wants to attend high school at home in Japan with Shizuku. After finishing high school, he will be able to pursue his dreams in Cremona; once he is a famous violinmaker and Shizuku is a professional author, they can get married. Shizuku teases him for sounding a little corny, but as the sun rises, they have their whole lives optimistically planned out.

In the original script, however, the Japanese dialogue makes clear that Seiji has returned to Tokyo a day ahead of schedule to attend his junior high school (middle school) graduation ceremony. Within a few days, he will be leaving for Cremona to resume his long-term apprenticeship. As they cling to each other under a single jacket, he and Shizuku both cling to the touchingly juvenile hope that someday, in the far-off future, they will marry each other. Of course, the implication may be that just as Seiji's grandfather lost touch with the young woman he loved as a student in Germany, Seiji's youthful crush will not withstand the test of time and distance. This reflection gains significance as he shouts the final line of dialogue--""Shizuku, I love you!"" Perhaps the reaction we see momentarily on Shizuku's face goes beyond startled or astonished embarrassment. Is she not concerned, alarmed, even pained at the same time?",1340496000,6,6262,5.160591133004926
2458790,1,B000CDGVOO,"As my husband and I are fans of The Secret World of Arrietty, Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle, we were looking forwards to watching Whisper of the Heart and expecting it to be equally enjoyable.

Sadly, it was not.  After the first half an hour, we seriously considered turning this movie off.  Only the hope that it might get better, given time, kept us watching.  I rather wish we hadn't bothered.  This movie did not get better.  We remained bored throughout, and I actually laughed when the end credits rolled because it all just seemed so meaningless and I couldn't believe that I'd wasted my time with this film.  It was like watching paint dry, really.  Very pretty to look at, but totally lacking in any real substance or depth at all.

I can't help thinking that the principal problem with this movie is that it was targeted at a very specific audience:  namely, young girls.  Neither my husband, or I, were at all drawn into the conflicts of Shizuku as she struggles to deal with such yawn-inducing (for us) ""conflicts"" as love (more like puppy-love, actually) and the uncertainty of what she wants to do with her life.

I was bitterly disappointed by this movie because I thought that the description of it was extremely misleading.  I was expecting a fairy-tale like journey, much akin to the likes of Spirited Away, but ""a chance meeting with a mysterious cat"" turned out to be anything but.  In fact, it really is just some chance meeting with a stray cat, which Shizuku follows. It's all really boring, once you realize it really is just a stray cat that she's randomly decided to follow.  I got even more annoyed when Shizuku started trying to talk to the cat (and later, certain inanimate objects) because it seemed really boring and silly once I realized they weren't going to answer her back.  And it wasn't like anything she had to say to them was all that interesting(well, I certainly wasn't very interested.)

There were also a lot of sub-plots that seemed to just go nowhere.  Like the one where the main character is working on some song for the upcoming graduation---we never see the graduation event itself, (because it doesn't even occur during the timeline of the story) or find out whether the song was a success or how it worked out.  Furthermore, the main storyline itself wasn't particularly interesting.  I really struggled to sympathize with Shizuku's attempts to write a story, because we're not actually told what the story is about.

All in all, Whisper of the Heart felt like a ""slice of life"".  We got to watch Shizuku as she begins to try to find a direction in life, but in the end, I was left feeling like I'd just not been shown enough to feel like the movie had a worthwhile or meaningful ending.  Unfortunately, I was so bored by the end, I was rather pleased that it was over.

As I've said earlier in the review, this movie is definitely aimed at a very specific audience.  It didn't appeal to my husband and I, and I do wonder whether it would appeal to the very young, either.  Not really very much happens in it, and I think younger viewers would be bored.  We get to watch Shizuku eat dinner, do chores, walk to school and attend class... hardly gripping viewing!  I also felt that the ""love interest"" was handled very badly and the characters didn't seem very consistent.

In conclusion:  Watch Howl's Moving Castle, Spirited Away or The Secret World of Arietty.  Don't watch this.  It is boring and I think many viewers (not of the intended age group) will be very let down by it.",1339977600,12,3541,4.598086124401914

Of course, going by the fact that it was Studio Ghibli that did both films and its high ratings, I picked up Whisper of the Heart. I wasn't expecting a fantasy adventure, but I was expecting something... more. As others have said on here, there seemed to be a lot of filler and the movie felt long. I kept wondering to myself, 'when is this movie finally going to be over?' It's not the subject matter. I've watched The Girl Who Leapt Through Time and it has a similar theme of a schoolgirl who is confused about her feelings and has to sort them out, and I love that movie. Something about this one just didn't grab me. I didn't care too much about the characters. There's nothing wrong with them, but that's about as good as it gets.

HOWEVER, the scene where Seiji starts playing the violin and tells Shizuki to start singing Country Roads was magical, it started out with just her voice and his violin and then the store-owner and his friends come in midway and start playing backing instruments, that was a great scene; I could watch that on repeat.

2458795,5,B000CDGVOO,"Most (if not all) animation fans love anything that comes from Studio Ghibli, that said, this is one of the more obscure titles from the studio. It was story boarded/scripted by Miyazaki himself but actually directed by another talent, Yoshifumi Kondo (who likely would've become Miyazaki's successor had he not passed unexpectedly in 1998 at the age of 47). The animation is gorgeous, though the effort has been put into capturing the reality of a young girl's life in modern day Japan more than in creating an epic world of fantasy one might expect from a Ghibli film. Still, there are a few scenes of imagination that allow for that broader style of animation. Beautiful animation aside this film is a real gem, it's something that is hard to find not just in animated films but in live action or film in general. I anticipate it will shine even brighter on Blu-ray.

The charm of this story, like the charm of the animation, is in the realism. This film harkens back to that time in life between childhood and adulthood, the time when you are too old to be a kid but are too young to even be a young adult.

The main heroine, Shizuki, is trapped in a world of childhood fantasy, she loves to spend each day reading book after book. The rest of the world is telling her it's time to grow up but all she wants to think about are her stories. When an oddly ordinary looking cat leads her into a real life story of her own she meets a young boy, Seiji, not entirely unlike herself. He is dreaming too, but he is working to make his dreams a reality. His talent creating violins inspires her to become active and put her efforts into becoming a talented writer. As she tries to write her first story she drifts further from schoolwork and other obligations. Conflict comes realistically from her wanting to do what she is passionate about while having school and familial obligations. When she finishes the first draft she isn't sure it's good enough, will she be able to pursue her passion? Has she been wasting her time? Does she have any talent at all?

These are doubts every youth can relate to and that's what makes this film so great. No spoilers, but in the end she learns a wonderful lesson about finding your inner talents and developing them into something more. Then there is the forming relationship between her and her new friend, Seiji, which adds a sweet touch to the film overall. It's also nice to see her parents portrayed realistically as concerned but caring. As a matter of fact all the relationships are excellently crafted, including Shizuku's relationship with her older sister and her relationship with her best friend. Each rings incredibly true.

This film has an excellent lesson for children and preteens, school doesn't have to get in the way of your passions or interests, it should be used to enhance and strengthen your passions. As difficult as that may seem, especially at the time, it is all about attitude. In a world where every youth oriented show finds the main characters being rich, being pop stars, being television stars, being wizards, going to expensive boarding schools, and generally having unbelievable lives of fun with little adult supervision, it is nice to have this film. A film that depicts realism and does it all with beautiful animation and a wonderfully crafted, but simple, story. This is the kind of story we haven't seen since before preteens were tapped as a profitable market. As such, it may be too simple for the preteens of today (I still suggest they view it) but it will certainly be adored by young children and will provide nostalgia for adults who remember simpler times, before preteens were thought of as major consumers. This film is especially recommended for Ghibli fans or animation enthusiasts.

The sound design is terrific in this film and as with all Disney/Ghibli dubs this is top of the line. You have the Japanese track if you prefer it but the English dub here is superb and perfectly casted, Brittany Snow, David Gallagher, Ashley Tisdale, Cary Elwes, Jean Smart, all do excellent work.

I'm very pleased more Ghibli films are finally coming to Blu-ray in the U.S. I've been waiting for a long while for news on Spirited Away or Howl's Moving Castle, but never did I expect this would be one of the first titles to make the jump to HD. Since it's listed with Castle in the Sky and Arietty, I can only assume Disney is putting it out as a more obscure title hoping fans of those more prominent titles will pick it up at the same time, and I suggest they do. It makes sense if this comes out right alongside Arrietty as both are simpler stories about a young girl coming to terms with the world, and many parents took their children to see Arrietty. That seems to be the marketing decision behind it. Either way I'm not complaining, quite the opposite. I'm so glad this film is coming to blu-ray and hope many more Ghibli titles follow closely behind.

Pick this 5 star film up with Castle in the Sky and Arrietty.",1333065600,8,4999,4.622747747747748
2458796,5,B000CDGVOO,"I look forward to this film coming out on Blu-ray. I have seen it in a theater and own it on DVD.

This is one of my favorite Studio Ghibli films. It follows a middle school student as she begins to look inside herself to find her creative talent as a writer. On the surface, it is a romance, but it is really about creativity and developing a skill at creative work.

Shizuku begins to look at what she wants to do in life after becoming interested in a boy who is determined to master a highly skilled craft. The film follows her first exploration into finding out whether she has a talent and how to develop it.

The location is the Tama area of Tokyo which was featured in an earlier Ghibli film ""Pom Poko"" when the area was developed and tanuki (Japanese raccoon dogs) fought the developers for their homeland. Whisper of the Heart takes place after the development is completed and the area populated.

Since most Ghibli films take place in beautiful countryside, the studio wanted to make a film that urban and suburban  children could relate to directly. So, they applied their luscious style to the Tama area. One thing I've always found appealing about Ghibli films is the gorgeous backgrounds. Not being a fan of the urban landscape I was surprised at how appealing they made the Tama area.

2458800,5,B000CDGVOO,"Directed by the late Yoshifumi Kondo (screenplay and storyboards by the acclaimed filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki), ""Whisper of the Heart"" is one of those films that capture so many things - the pangs of growing up, adolescent angst, finding one's place in the world, and following that inner voice within one's own heart.

The setting is Tokyo - teenager Shizuku Tsukishima is a bookish girl who'd rather while away the hours buried in a book than study her school books. Shizuku feels there's something missing in her life and a chance encounter with an indifferent yet strangely captivating cat on a train one day changes the course of her life. Shizuku follows the cat to an old antique store, where she is captivated by the statue of a mysterious cat (the Baron, who made a lasting impression on fans in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cat-Returns/dp/B0006J28BO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cat Returns</a>). Later, Shizuku discovers that the store is owned by an old man who happens to be the grandfather of Seiji Amasawa, the very young man whose name had been on the library cards of many of the books Shijuku's been checking out.

A gentle friendship develops between the two teenagers, one that baffles and delights Shizuku. Her lack of confidence in herself makes her question the balance in this friendship as she thinks very highly of Seiji's talents as a budding violin maker, whereas she thinks she has nothing much to offer in return. She just writes song lyrics and wastes time reading fairy tales, pursuits she deems worthless. It takes a while, but Shizuku does finally find her true calling, and the statue of the Baron serves as an inspiration towards this end.

I loved the way the story took its time to unfold. Nothing felt rushed or plodding - this is one of those movies that I would watch again on a leisurely weekend afternoon, and reflect upon my younger days. It is such a sweet, if a tad melodramatic, coming of age story that is sure to warm anyone's heart. Note: The picture quality is crisp and clear. There are scenes of Shizuku's father smoking, and minor language (in some earlier scenes, Shizuku calls Seiji ""stupid jerk"" several times, and also uses the term ""idiot"", but that's it).",1332547200,5,2264,5.032

2458802,5,B000CDGVOO,"The director of this film, Yoshifumi Kondo- was on the way to being successor to Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata.
Unfortunately, 3 years after this masterpiece, at the age of 47. Unfortunately he only directed one Ghibli film. Fortunately it's one of the best.

This is a personal favourite of mine, travel back to when I was in year 4 (10 or 11 years old) and I begun collecting Ghibli films on DVD (It's great to be a Ghibli fan in Australia :P we get some nice DVD releases and some of the better covers in my opinion). This was one of the more elusive ones, which made me yearn for it even more. I eventually found it in a store which had it at the retail price of $30 (the store I usually bought them from had $2-3 off retail price, and even then was having a huge Ghibli sale that lasted some time which made my collection expand swiftly.) It was probably the first Ghibli I bought for more than $15.98 besides Spirited Away (which still wasn't retail price). I think to this day it's the most I've spent on a Ghibli film (that and Tales of Earthsea, which by the way we got many many years before ths US oddly enough).

You'd think with almost $15 more than almost all my other Ghibli films it'd be easy to be disappointed right? Wrong.

I was in awe at this film, if I recall correctly it may have beaten Totoro to the top in my favourites if not sharing the top place.
This film for one, looks utterly amazing, it has wonderful art and just such a great universe to be sucked into.
The story isn't too strange, nor is it too bland. It's just real, nothing like the usual Ghibli tale, but still has the magic of one. The music like any Ghibli film is beautiful. Another thing to make Australia proud is Australia's Own Olivia Newton John singing the opening song of Country Roads.
There are slight fantasy aspects of the film, which are parts of the lead's imagination. Some of these scenes are rather odd, but still beautiful and still are great to watch.

One thing about this film that disappointed me is what is considered to be the Spin-off. The Cat Returns, which is a great movie- but is supposedly to be based off of the in-film novel written by the lead, and the imagination sequences, The Cat Returns does not do a good job of this and only seems to share one or two things with what we learn about the novel. I would love to see an accurate adaptation of this by Ghibli, including the scenes of it we see in Whisper of the Heart.

Chances are I've forgotten to put something in this review- so I'll just end with this.

Whisper of the Heart is amazing, I highly recommend it, it's unique, it's real, and it's beautiful.
And for the price Amazon is doing it for- why on earth not?

I fall in love with this film every time I watch it. I feel like every woman, young and old, can relate to the main character Shizuku. She reminds me of when I was younger and dealing with the same problems she comes across. The ending is a bit of heart warmer too.

It may be one of the reasons, this is one of the most splendid anime among Studio GHIBLI.

The process when light love feeling of a Japanese serious young student changes is drawn.
There is not the intense scene.
Young naive two people do that they can do it as much as possible awkwardly, and it becomes the last scene to be impressed by.
There may be a person to feel to be boring but, their pure thought reminds you that oneself of the youth was so.

Shizuku and Seiji talk in English not Japanese, but there is not the sense of incongruity at all.

Whisper of the Heart and Only Yesterday by other directors are hands down my favorites. Why, because they are a slice of real life and emotions that we have all experienced at a point in our lives. The awkwardness and wonder of entering adulthood the clueless cruelty of other children towards their peers as away of dealing with their own struggles is captured beautifully in these films. On the flip side for fantasy with a good message Miyazaki's work is unrivaled.",1323734400,,594,4.891089108910891

2458808,4,B000CDGVOO,"Whisper of the Heart is a sweet coming-of-age story about young love and having the courage to follow your heart.  It is a gentle film, at turns sweet, sad, and funny.  I was really charmed by the main character, a dreamer who lives in fairy tales she reads in the library.  Shizuku is just a terrific character, easy to relate to and very likeable.  I love how she's a bit of a slacker, whether at school or at home, but the people in her life are important to her, and she really tries hard to be a good friend.

The story is beautiful and romantic, but very down to earth.  There's plenty of slice-of-life stuff here, which I tend to enjoy.  I liked how the Shizuku grew as the story progressed, but didn't lose those qualities that made me love her from the start.  The other characters in the film are enjoyable to watch, especially the boy who Shizuku is starting to like.  But the cast of characters are really only important as they relate to the main character, and her journey in the film.  This is okay, because the story is really only about Shizuku and all their scenes serve to further her story rather than theirs.  (For instance, her best friend is having romantic problems, but all her scenes in the film are only to highlight Shizuku's life and relationships, and there is no real resolution to her friend's story.)  Even so, you never get the feeling that these are not real people, with their own dreams to follow, jobs to do, lives being lived when Shizuku is not around.  The story just doesn't deal with them too much.  But it doesn't need to, because in the end, this is the story of one girl starting to grow up and maybe starting to fall in love.

The animation is wonderful, and there is great attention to detail.  Little things stand out, like the way Shizuku tries to turn off her lamp and fumbles around without reaching it until she sits up in bed.  It's the little details that bring the film, and its characters, to life.

I really liked the film.  It's a movie for dreamers and romantics.  Shizuku is a great addition to Ghibli's cast of great film heroines.  For those who liked Shizuku's fantasy story scenes, there is a sequel to this movie called The Cat Returns, which follows the Baron (the cat statue in this movie) and a new cast of characters.  It does not have much of a connection to this film, but it is a fun movie in its own right, with more fantastic elements (kind of a girl-in-another-world story).  I recommend both films, but I think that Whisper of the Heart is the more emotionally powerful and inspirational of the two.  If you like animated films, or Studio Ghibli films in particular, you should enjoy this movie.",1306108800,,2672,4.461855670103093

I recommend watching this to anyone. It was not only inspirational to make you want to go out and chase your dream, but after watching it, I got over my writer's block and finished my own work I had been working on.

The animation is the usual high quality we've come to expect from any Ghibli film and this film doesn't have that surreal feel to it that 'Howls Moving Castle' or 'Spirited Away' engender. There are many moments where you'll smile or laugh to yourself and the story is sweet and charming. I found the ending a touch abrupt, but that is a minor flaw and doesn't detract from the overall feel or quality of this film. You should finish this film with a nice warm glow inside and also inspired to work harder at fulfilling your life's dreams. I know I did! Another great Ghibli film and well worth a viewing.

2458813,5,B000CDGVOO,"Most action movies are pure fluff, relying on clichs, special effects, and bravado to win over the mostly male audiences that keep them in the pipeline. They are junk food. They provide the illusion of satisfying us but they are not nutritious or filling at all. But then there are those action movies which are so solid, well-written, well-acted, well-paced, and well-done that we don't even think of them as action movies. They are the action movie gourmet meals. Think of Lawrence of Arabia or even Full Metal Jacket. Movies like that are outside the traditional action realm, and tend to have much wider appeal. They are entertaining and smart.

Likewise, the action movie's female counterpart, the romance movie, tends to be fluff, relying on overwrought acting and writing, schmaltzy music, and clichs. Even rarer than the ""good"" action movie is the good romance movie. A movie that realistically depicts love and interpersonal relationships without relying on any clichs or overwrought acting or writing. City Lights is one example of this, the works of Ernst Lubitsch are another. Think of his movie The Shop Around the Corner. It's a love story that works by depicting real ""moments"" (as critics like to call them). Instead of being a hammy soap opera, these movies work by touching us on a real level. You don't cringe watching these, you don't say to yourself ""Who talks like that?"" and you don't hear schmaltzy music all of the time to let you know what emotion you are supposed to be feeling.

I'm bringing all this up to make the point to any guy who is reading this that ""Yes, there are good romance movies you will like."" Whisper of the Heart is a movie like that, and BOY is it a good one. You've heard of the rare romance movie that both men and women like equally, this is one of them. Guys will like it because it isn't junk food. Comparing this movie to typical romance garbage like Up Close and Personal is like comparing a piece of filet mignon to a Slim Jim. People talk like real people, they have real problems that 14-year-olds have, and they relate to their family like real 14-year-olds do.

This movie should be easy to find on DVD and for once I do not hesitate to say ""watch it dubbed."" Miyazaki himself says that his movies should be seen in the language of the viewer, and not subtitled, so that you can devote your full attention to the image on the screen and not to reading subtitles (I make the exception for Princess Mononoke which IMO has a inferior dub). It was written by Miyazaki but directed by another very talented man who unfortunately died not long after making this, his only film. The influence of Miyazaki shows in this film, although the animation style is a little different, and the style of the backgrounds is *very* different. I do not know what process was used, but I'd say they based all of the backgrounds on real photographs. The lighting in them is so well that some of them could easily pass for photographs on an NTSC display unless you look at them long and closely. The pacing in this film is also very well-done. Too many directors hurry through pacing, they don't want there to be any silences because they don't know how to use silence. This director does.",1290988800,4,3225,4.62478184991274

2458815,5,B000CDGVOO,"Ok first off if you are after a faced paced action packed white knuckles thrill ride viewing experience this is NOT your kind of movie.  For the most part this movie offers its viewers what is for the most part an amazingly accurate picture of what it is like to be a family in Japan.  The movie treats you as if you are a silent onlooker as this young ladies life unfolds before you.  There are few if any fast cuts and action sequences designed to fast forward you into a basic understanding of what motivates the characters.  Great time and effort was taken to allow the complexities of each character to unfold before you.  As the movie played on I actually had the sense that I was being allowed to get to know each character.  Another thing that makes this movie special is each character was crafted with amazing subtelty and attention to detail making feel real.  The attention to detail and slow pace of character development in Whisper of the Heart made me want to invest myself in loving each character for the unique perspectives, joys and pains and insights they brought to the overall work. This is not the movie for someone who needs an action sequence every 4 minutes to stay interested and connected to the movie.  This movie is for someone who enjoys people, love and the most awesome cultural aspects of Japan.

I was impressed also with the quality of the animation.  The sheens on the wood surfaces as light shines on them in rooms was awesome.  The attention to detail in the look and feel of the fathers library workplace was astounding.  As the young lady decended the stairs I could almost the crisp air heavy with the unique smell books have when collected together.  The train stations and appropriate signage were also well detailed. True attention to detail during animation can be seen by looking out of the windows as the train goes from place to place.  The scenery changes, the support poles for the trains electric power lines pass by as expected.  It is not the same three to seven buildings passing by in cheap animation seen on the Flintstones and Jetsons for example.

This is a love story between a adulescent young man and woman both on track to enter high school in Japan.  I will say nothing more about the plot because; I do not want to spoil it for others.  This is an awesome movie.  It is slow in pace but if you care about cultural details and want to get a sense of what life in Japan is like this is a great beginning on your journey toward understanding and human enlightenment.  There is One VERY unrealistic plot point in this movie I feel compelled to point out.  At one point the high school aged young lady flirts with the idea of not entering or completing high school.  Her grades drop off to a point that is totally worrisome and her parents eventually become very mellow and supportive of her plans.  Unfortunately most typical parents in Japan do not reach with passive love when their childs grades fall and they express a desire not to continue school.  In Japan the entire culture is geared to seek perfection in all things.  In Japan school, college and job life is a never ending competition and everyone and I mean everyone is taught from birth to take the important competitions in life seriously.  Few parents would behave as the young ladies parents did when her grades fell and she announced she would not be attending high school.  That said this movie is worth owning.  It is sweet light and wonderful and might leave a tear in your eye at its ending.

This is a movie about real people doing real things. Any number of teenagers could have lived this movie, there's no magic or fantasy, but there's also none of the bull that makes most modern romances so bad.

2458819,4,B000CDGVOO,"Whisper of the Heart is a film produced by Studio Ghibli and directed by Yoshifumi Kondo.  It is based on a manga by Aoi Hiiragi.  Whisper of the Heart is a very well-told and well-animated coming of age story.  You really feel for the characters, and you can identify with them and the situations they go through if you've been through adolescence yourself.  Whisper of the Heart is also a good family viewing experience; there's really nothing in the film that is inappropriate for younger viewers.

When Whisper of the Heart was released on DVD in the United States, it was released as a two-disc set.  The first disc contains the film and two special features.  For the film, you can select what scenes you want to see.  You can also choose between English and Japanese audio, and you can also choose to have English captions for the Hearing Impaired or to have English subtitles, or to not have subtitles at all.  The main menu also has a ""Sneak Peeks"" option, which allows you to choose which of the trailers you want to see that are included at the beginning of the disc.

The first bonus feature on the disc is a roughly eight minute long documentary titled, ""Behind the Microphone.""  During the documentary, you see some of the English voice actors recording the English dialogue for the dub version of the film.  There are also interviews with some of the English dub actors and staff (Brittany Snow, Ashley Tisdale, Ned Lott, Rick Dempsey, David Gallagher, Martin Spanjers, Courtney Thorne-Smith, Jean Smart, Harold Gould, and Cary Elwes).  It's not a bad documentary for what it is.

The only other special feature on the disc are the Japanese trailers and TV spots for Whisper of the Heart, which run for about eleven minutes.  There are six in all, and they have Japanese audio and English subtitles.  The spots are in one continuous piece, and there is no way to select which ones you want to see.

All that is on the second disc of Whisper of the Heart is a storyboard version of the film.  This is basically the same as the movie, except it utilizes storyboards and none of the actual animation.  I really don't understand the point or appeal of seeing the complete film in storyboard form.  This release would have been stronger if it was just one disc instead of two, and only had brief storyboard-to-animation comparisons of some of the scenes on the first disc.  I believe that including the second disc is a waste.

If you are a fan of Studio Ghibli's films, then you should see Whisper of the Heart.  Even with the unnecessary second disc, and the few minor complaints about the bonus features on disc one, this is a DVD that should be in the collection of any anime fan.

2458824,4,B000CDGVOO,"Whisper of the Heart / B000CDGVOO

Although I usually avoid movies with youthful angst and uncertainty, ""Whisper of the Heart"" touched a deep nerve with me. The characters are touchingly realistic and poignant as they navigate a difficult period of growth and development with a mix of intense creativity and unfocussed existential uncertainty. In particular, the character of Suzuku tugs deeply at the heart-strings of the viewer, as she fluctuates between the ennui of young adulthood and a fevered dream of creativity as she attempts to ""prove"" herself to her family, her loved ones, and even to herself.

Stricken with low self-esteem, she mistakenly believes that everyone around her - including her love interest - is confidently following their dreams, without a single second thought or self-doubt. Suzuku believes that she alone is `not good enough', that she is wasting her life and her talent by failing to produce - immediately! - a material example of her dedication, hard-work, and raw talent. After she pours her heart and soul into a youthful novel, she is able to find peace with the understanding that she is ""good enough"" with or without a successful novel, if only because she genuinely tried. The movie ends on a note that I wish more `creative genius' features would focus on - Suzuku plans to hone her craft, because it needs polishing, but she has found a quiet peace and acceptance with herself and those around her.

A long and introspective movie, ""Whisper of the Heart"" is a lovely movie for anyone who has ever struggled with low self-esteem or with general self-acceptance.

2458825,4,B000CDGVOO,"I've been a comic strip junky all my life. You know, the panels in the newspaper? Like Li' Abner, Dick Tracy, Peanuts, Doonesbury, Calvin and Hobbes, Get Fuzzy...? That's just the American tradition, of course, and it's quite distinct from the European -- Tintin, for instance, or Asterix and Obelix -- and from political cartooning. The daily strips are addictive; even though 4 out of 5 installments are utterly boring in and of themselves, the ongoing development takes on a ""life"" inside your own Life. Perhaps the key is that Life itself is a steady panel of trivial moments that accumulate interest as memories.

But I'm not an ""anime"" addict. I watched ""Whisper of the Heart"" as an outsider, much as a Turk or an Icelander might pick up an American newspaper and find himself thoroughly non-plussed by a panel of Rex Morgan MD. I rented Whisper simply because a musical colleague told me that I'd be ""blown away"" by one scene in which three elderly Japanese men pull out instruments and join in a jam session with the two teenage lovers-to-be who are the principal characters. Well, I rented, I watched, I waited. Beautifully drawn animation! Marvelously evocative of Japan, where I have lived. Sweet, humane, and stunningly boring for the first 45 minutes ...

... and then, the jam session! Hard to believe my eyes! Is this an in-group joke perpetrated by some Japanese animationist who happens to be a Baroque music dilettante? The song they play is the goldy-moldy ""Country Road, Take me Home"", but the instruments the oldsters play are a viola da gamba, a six-course lute, and a Renaissance cornetto, while the boy hero plays Bassano-like ""diminutions"" on his violin. Huh? and again, huh?

The jam session is, happily, the turning point of the film. Thereafter the story-line develops some gentle momentum; one starts to engage with the cute little cartoon kids, to have a pocket of warmth in one's heart for them, like for the children of a distant cousin... or for the grandchildren of Dagwood and Blondie. Without any justification, I had always supposed that Japanese anime films were invariably dark, violent, edgy... but Whisper of the Heart is pure syrup, a mushy love story without the truly Japanese denouement of a 'double-suicide'.

Net evaluation: watch it for the gorgeous graphics, and don't expect much from the story.",1260748800,2,2345,4.9291139240506325
2458826,4,B000CDGVOO,"this movie reminded me slightly of kiki's delivery service. kiki's delivery service was made before it though, and i'd have to say that it was a better story of self discovery. but as whisper of the heart is alos from studio ghibli, the fact that it pales in comparison to kiki in no way makes it a bad film.

whisper of the heart is the story of a girl who is at odds with herself. she has no direction and doesn't know what she will do in the future. she meets a boy who loves music and is inspired by his passion, so decides to write a novel. there isn't a lot of action in the movie, but watching shizuku struggle with her frustration at discovering what she enjoys and what she should do with her life, and then the passion and effort she puts into attempting to fulfill that endears her to the audience. she struggles with some conventions that the young people of today are encouraged to participate in. i won't say exactly what so as not to spoil anything, but suffice it to say that she resisted this convention because didn't see the use of participating and later returned to it when she saw the use.

at the end of the movie, shizuku finds her beginning, and i have to say that the story she is writing bears more than a resemblance to the cat returns, another ghibli film created after this one.

overall a sweet film, but kiki does a better job of it on the whole.",1256601600,,1378,4.272030651340996

This movie, like his others, can be enjoyed by younger audiences and adults. Children will see it as a boy meets girl movie, but older viewers will admire both the story and the exquisite scenery provided by Studio Ghibli. We have yet to be disappointed by any of Mizazaki's works, and this film is a fine blend of story and art, and of the world we live in and the fantasy that awaits us just around the corner. This is an excellent and beautiful movie from the master of Japanese animated cinema.",1256601600,,611,4.614678899082569
2458828,5,B000CDGVOO,"I was sure when I heard ""Country Road"" at the beginning of Whisper to the Heart that somebody had turned on the radio. But no, the song is a very present element to this wonderful animated movie. It's a distinct film in Studio Ghibli's repertoire, given that it's not a tangent fantasy and the setting of Tokyo is never really abandoned. It instead explores the subject of magic in other forms; just what is magic, and where can one find it? The first and only film directed by the late Yoshifumi Kondo, it is a heart-warming movie that explores the magic of life, and what it means to find yourself. It's something many can relate to, including yours truly.

Shizuku is a well-meaning but insecure junior high school student in Japan. Pressure is high on her year as they need good grades if they are to get into a good education. Shizuku, however, is restless and spends most of her time helping out other people, particularly with adopting English language songs into Japanese for her friends. Still, she longs for a direction. Her kind-meaning but demanding family don't help her there.

A series of events, however, lead Shizuku to meet Seiji, a boy from her year who wants to be a violin-maker. The two set up a warm, believable friendship. Inspired by Seiji's belief in his dream, Shizuku realises that to find herself, she has to follow her heart. Seiji's uncle, who runs an antique store (one of the items there is the Baron Cat featured in The Cat Returns), helps her in looking inside herself. Shizuku realises she wants to be a writer. But should she stay in school, or quit like Seiji and follow her dream? Can she find the courage?

John Denver's ""Country Road"" is a solid backbone to Whisper of the Heart, which is a beautiful piece of filmwork - written and storyboarded by Hayao Myazaki, it's a deep film with a profound, human insight. It's possibly even more distinct for the visual style of Shizuku's fantasy world, visualised by established artist Naohisa Inoue, whom Myazaki approached for the film. Though copyright issues may have led to its late US-release, Whisper of the Heart is a different kind of gem from Ghibli - a thoughtful revelation on what it means to not only look inside yourself and find out who you are, but what it means to act on it. It is an animated movie to be cherished, beautiful both visually and philosophically.",1253923200,,2362,4.6594724220623505
2458829,4,B000CDGVOO,"Lets start off by saying, if you're experience with Ghibli studios is Monokoke, Naussica, Spirited Away and Howle's Moving Castle, and that is what you are looking for, this is NOT your movie.

'Whisper of the Heart' is a touching, heartwarming story of a young Jr. High girl trying to discover who she is and where she is going. It reminded me a bit of a Japanese version of the 1979 film ""A Little Romance"" with Sir. Laurence Olivier and Diane Lane. The heart is incredible, the characters around her are supportive and wise, and she and her friends are passionate, insecure and trying to figure out love, life, career, future and how to grow up.
This is a movie you want to watch if you want a 'feel good' movie, and you can appreciate art- things like the lead reaching up to turn her lamp off, but it takes her a second or two to find the switch. Very realistic and artsy (to the point where at times it seems possibly a little dragged out, but as a filmmaker myself I really appreciate the realism that is the Miyazaki/Yakahada style).

This movie can not compare to movies such as Porko Rosso and Naussica, it's a completely different type of film. You could compare this to Miyazaki's ""Grave of the Fireflies"". This film is NOT a high flying imagination adventure, it is a heartwarming, laid back, touching look into the life of a young tween trying to find her calling.",1251244800,2,1378,4.508

I was prepared from reading previous reviews that ""whisper of the Heart"" would not be a fantasy laden tale.  That being said, I must still say that I did enjoy it.  I must also say that it is a bit slow.  I think they could've cut out about 1 hour's worth of filler (numerous scenes of the girl just walking or the entire first portion of the movie that's nothing but her running errands) and still conveyed their message.  Compared to other Studio Ghibli films this was just somewhat boring (most of their films are slow, but this was really slow).  Also, I felt the choice of ""Country Roads"" as a theme song was very out of place in this film. As soon as you hear the words ""Virginia and Mountain Mama"" you start to wonder why they ever chose the song.  I laughed everytime I heard it because it sounded so out of place in Tokyo.  Other than that, the movie is a very touching coming of age story, although the ending was a bit unbelievable. Overall, it was worth watching at least once to see the origin of ""The Cat Returns"" and I'm glad I did.  I do recommend seeing this at least once if you are a fan of Studio Ghibli or of ""The Cat Returns"".",1219795200,4,1243,4.25531914893617

2458841,5,B000CDGVOO,"When you watch a Studio Ghibli film you expect certain things. A fantastic cast of characters, an origional story line and moments that tug at all human emotions. 'Whisper of Heart' directed by Yoshifumi Kondo brings it all out in a heartwaming coming of age story.

Shazuku is a young 14 year old who is growing up following motions of ordinary life. Though she craves to live in the worlds of magic and fairytales, she always keeps brining herself back down to earth thinking she can never be her own person. Then with all the worries about getting into high school and helping her friends as they develop intrests in boys,  her dreams are further from her reach than ever. Then one day she notices the same name showing up in all the library books she checked out and wonders who this mystery boy is who shares all these same intrests as her. Not realizing it's him at first she meets Saiji a guy with big ambitions and trying to find his own way to become a professional violin maker. Their friendship blossoms into a beautiful story like Shazukus' fairy tales and soon she is able to follow her dreams with the help of some unlikly friends.

'Whisper of the Heart' is such a warm movie that shows the togetherness of family, friendship and love. It is a movie that will whisk you away and melt your heart as you see a young girl realize that there is a place for her in the big world. All she has to do is listen to her heart.",1214092800,5,1431,4.37218045112782

2458843,5,B000CDGVOO,"This is a great, though somewhat different, Studio Ghibli film. Make no mistake about it, this is a teenage love story, there's very little fantasy and no real action to speak of. It is still a very well told and heartfelt film though, and definitely has Ghibli's impressive storytelling written all over it.

The film tends to be pretty slow paced, but actually feels more realistic as a result. It is this sense of realism that is the movies greatest strength I've found. The characters and their behavior, their lives and how they live, and just about everything else has a sense of realism that you don't often get from this genre. So many movies/shows in this genre seem to have some kind of hook, but this film doesn't rely on one. Yeah, you have the minor fantasy sequences, but those aren't really a hook so much as a result of Shizuku's imagination. You'll know what I mean when you view it if you haven't.

It's great to see the relationship form, and then to witness how it effects Shizuku's life and how they deal with the hurdles placed before them. This relationship is really the focus of the story, and it only benefits from the sense of realism I mentioned previously.

The dub is pretty well done, though Seiji's performances was hit or miss. Overall he did a good job, but there were a few scenes where the delivery was a bit lacking. Cary Elwes pulls off a perfect sounding Baron yet again, even though his role in this film is significantly less than in ""The Cat Returns"". Brittany Snow played a great Shizuku and pulls off the scenes with singing wonderfully; she has a great singing voice. The use of ""Country Roads"" was actually pretty well done I thought, and it didn't feel strange at all; I mean, after watching this film I actually have the song stuck in my head now.

Despite the films age I did not feel that it suffered from it. The animation was terrific and the imagery didn't really make it feel dated. The artwork was great and is a testament to Ghibli that they can animate a plain modern city and still manage to impress the audience with the visuals. Their eye for detail is also strongly presented in this film, as you see the characters act or move in a manner that is more realistic, but many other studios wouldn't bother animating. Ghiblis attention to subtle details is one of the things that sets them apart. Seeing these subtleties and movements in a more familiar setting only makes their appearance that much more noticeable.

In the end this is yet another Ghibli great. For fans of their more unique films, this might be a bit of a disappointment though. This isn't a fantasy film, or sci-fi, nor does it have any action or a vital life or death plot to it. It's a love story through and through, but it's also a very well told love story with impressive storytelling to back it up.",1209254400,3,2832,4.512670565302145

Seiji had dreams of becoming a violin maker and Shizuku wants to be a writer. Both of them find out that it takes schooling and hard work to reach their dreams.
Miyazaki has a wonderful way of portraying children, gentle and still very natural and realistic. When watching this movie I felt I got a glimps of life in Japan and wonder if this is a life of the past or if one still lives that way.

2458846,5,B000CDGVOO,"Whisper of the Heart is a wonderful adaptation of Aoi Hiiragi's manga work and who does it better than the guys at Ghibli. Master Hayao Miyazaki with Yoshifumi Kondo direction, you see how real this animation is about the life of a girl name Shizuku. I won't go into too much detail as others here have already provided more than enough information on this outstanding gem like all of Miyazaki's animated production films. I just like to point out that the ending could of been more heartfelt than it was in my opinion. For those who haven't seen this movie yet...stop here and go rent this for the whole family to enjoy.

** spoiler **
The scene where Shizuku's dad tuck the blanket over her in bed than showing the night sky as it fade to the credits would of been a sad but worthy ending. It's more realistic and acceptable then to have Seiji show up at her place early in the cold morning on his bicycle from out of nowhere and ask her to come ride with him to somewhere is a bit odd when he should be in Italy learning to become a master violin builder. Now here is where it got a little wierd...the ending where he basically propose to her to marry him after taking her on top of this hill to see the sun rise. I mean how many guys would ask a girl to marry him when they haven't even gone out yet?!? Then again, maybe that happens more than not in Japan but not really here. Nevertheless, it does not hurt this charming movie one bit as I still highly recommend everyone to watch this animated movie. Great theme song on country road, top notch dubbing, especially the Baron voice over by Cary Elwes, which continues on in the sequal, The Cats Return.

I'm a big fan of Hayao Miyazaki's animated work and have seen Spirited Away, Porco Rosso, Castle in the Sky, Nausica of the Valley of the Wind, My Neighbor Totoro, The Castle of Cagliostro, Howl's Moving Castle and a few other gems, which i will provide a review on some of them in the future.",1205539200,2,1953,4.333333333333333
2458847,2,B000CDGVOO,"I hate to give anything by Ghibli a negative review, trust me it has NEVER happened before, but Whisper of the Heart is hardly as good as any of Ghibli's great films, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Away/dp/B00005JLEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Away</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grave-of-the-Fireflies-2-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00006HAWP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grave of the Fireflies (2-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Neighbor-Totoro/dp/B0001XAQ0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Neighbor Totoro</a>. The technical aspects of the film are on par with anything Ghibli has done up to this time, and a lot of the same plot devices are present in this film, but Whispers lacks the magic and wonder which made other Ghibli films, including its sequel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cat-Returns/dp/B0006J28BO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cat Returns</a>, great.

Although Hayao Miyazaki (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Howl-s-Moving-Castle/dp/B000CDGVOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Howl's Moving Castle</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Princess-Mononoke/dp/B00003CXBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Princess Mononoke</a>) wrote the script and storyboarded for this film, he didn't direct it. It has a lot of the same elements of any Miyazaki film, female lead, a coming of age story, romance, etc. but whereas Miyazaki's films almost always held a universal appeal in that almost anyone could enjoy them Whispers is directed and will appeal to only one group of people, young girls, of which I personally am not. This is a coming of age story about a young middle school girl who, at the start of the film, spends most of her time in a book or fooling around doing absolutely nothing. Her life is turned upside down, however, when she meets a young man named Seiji. She sees that he knows what he wants to do with his life and that he has a purpose for livening, which forces her to examine herself. She realizes that her life, for the most part, is meaningless and sets out on a journey to find herself.

Parts of this story are extremely easy to relate with, the overbearing overachieving sister (she was EXACTLY like my own sister), the self doubt, the insecurity, the hopeless search for happiness and meaning in ones life are all emotions which are easy to see in oneself. Unfortunately the movie doesn't focus on these elements as much as they should; instead it decides to turn the story into yet another generic and clich tween romance. The story starts out so heartwarming, so beautiful and light, but then takes a nose dive straight into mediocrity. Maybe romance just isn't my thing, but whenever I see middle scholars talk about romance, love, and (cough) getting married when they grow older, I can't help but role my eyes. There is nothing more annoying then tween romances.

The animation, like all Ghibli's works, is good for the most part and great in all the right places. The character designs are relatively simple, the motion fluid, and the backgrounds detailed and diverse. One of the closing scenes, when Shizuku and Seiji are together looking at a sunrise, was one of the most beautifully animated scenes for any Ghibli movie ever made. I'm a sucker for a good sunrise scene, and although it didn't match the brilliance of similar scenes from movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Place-Promised-in-Our-Early-Days/dp/B0009PLMAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Place Promised in Our Early Days</a>, for the time it was made (1995) its fantastic.

Overall if you like tween romances, then go ahead and see this film. Just because I didn't like it (and I'm in the minority here) doesn't mean that you won't, but I warn you do not expect the same wonder and excitement of Miyazaki's films, this is a romance and nothing but.

2458857,5,B000CDGVOO,"""Whisper of the Heart"" (1995), animated coming-of-age story was scripted and storyboarded by Hayao Miyazaki and directed by the Yoshifumi Kondo. Hayao Miyazaki (Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbor Totoro, Howl's Moving Castle, Spirited Away, and Princess Mononoke) saw in Kondo his successor as Studio Ghibli's film director. Unfortunately, Kondo was only able to direct a single Ghibli film, ""Whisper of the Heart"", before his untimely death in 1998. As magical and beautiful as the rest of Studio Ghibli feature films I've seen, gentle ""Whisper of the Heart"" focuses on the dreams, feelings, insecurities, and search for life's meaning of two teenagers - middle school students Shizuku Tsukishima and Seiji Amasawa in modern Tokyo. We also meet Shizuku's and Seiji's friends and families. We will follow a  smart and curious  cat that likes to ride the subway  train by himself and one day would lead Shizuku to a magical shop run by Mr. Nishi, a kind, wise old man whose teenaged grandson Seiji Amasawa checks out from the local library the same books Shizuku does. The boy dreams of becoming a violin master. There are untold stories behind the beautiful objects in Mr. Nishi's store that wait to be told, but it would take a talent to capture and to write them down. In the shop, Shizuku meets her first love and starts the long road on becoming the writer.

The beauty of the film lies not in the mythical worlds or the fantastic creatures from the fairy tales. It is in the little film's  universal appeal, in the way all viewers, the children and their parents,  can relate to one girl's  search for place in life, for her determination to follow the dream , and for support, guidance, and approval she so desperately needs and receives from her busy but loving and understanding parents. My favorite scene in the film is the conversation 15-year-old Shizuku has with her mother and father at the kitchen table about her future. It was so realistic, filled with the warmth, love, and understanding that children need from their parents. ""Whisper of the heart"" reminded me the films of the great Japanese film director, Yasujiro Ozu. While watching this new Tokyo story, I felt the same warmth, soft tenderness, power of human emotions and moving simplicity as in the  Ozu's films from over than 50 years ago.",1192060800,8,2317,4.892857142857143

Shizuku thinks that her boring life is never going to get any better, until one day she decides to follow a cat home and finds a wonderful antique shop. Inside lies more than just treasures from long ago, but treasures for the future, too.

Also, for any of you fans of The Cat Returns, the Baron makes a suprising ""visit"".

Personally, I think this film was better off left in Japanese and subtitled. It was painful to watch Dubbed, since the voice actors never seemed to match the mouth animantions.

It, as with some Anime for children, portrays an intelligent, viable approach on life as a teenager or making that difficult transition from adolescent into adulthood, unlike most of the youth culture movies/tv in America today. It not only is entertaining but retains it's youthful essence throughout with a magical flair. At times, it can be corny, but not over-the-top.

As an extra bonus, the second DVD of this movie has the original storyboard (or at least a large portion of it) shown in sync with the audio of the movie playing in the background. This shows very clearly the artistic genius of Hayao Miyazaki, and just how much of his creative vision is infused into this movie.

If you haven't seen either yet, I recommend seeing Whisper of the Heart first. It's slightly slow, and focuses on the nuances of everyday life more than adventure. The main character, a girl named Shizuku, wants to be a writer and finds inspiration in The Baron, a beautiful statue of a nattily dressed cat. However, the story takes its time in transcribing Shizuku's life and thus might be boring to some who like adventure.

There is really no reason this had to be depicted as a cartoon, and that makes this have the least in common with the rest of the Studio Ghibli collection.

I preferred the Japanese audio better; I didn't really care for the English version because I felt that it took away from the movie. Half of the film is good because of the language.

2458880,5,B000CDGVOO,"I like John Denver's ""Country Road"" as well as that by Olivia Newton John. They give me the memory of my high school days when I sang the song in English.

Shizuku Tsukishima of this story does the amazing. She makes the Japanese language version of the song at the age of 14! (Miyazaki-san is also involved in the Japanese lyrics). Other than that she is ordinary but bit like Anne Shirley of the Anne of the Green Gables. She is a bookworm just like my elder sister. She likes borrowing books on fantasy novels. With Miyazaki/Kondo combination ordinary suburban Tokyo life was made much vivid and real. Characters' conversation is often interrupted by the rushing autos. Sounds so real. Violin featured Country Road is really nice. I just hope I want to explore the inside story written by Shizuku Tsukishima much further. Maybe you can enjoy the sequel? of that Shizuku's story at THE CAT RETURNS movie. Cat figurine BARON and drifting cat MOON(MUTA)also make the movie special. Miyazaki's brilliant scene cuts shines even at suburban Tokyo and the last sunrise scene is excellently described. Yeah Miyazaki and Kondo tell us we can find a little bit of fantasy in urban life. Shizuku's mother's eco-friendly attitude is cool as well.

Verdict: Wonderful coming of the age movie by late Yoshifumi Kondo.
Rating: 97 out of 100. Makes me want to go back to Junior High School Days.

2458893,5,B000CDGVOO,"Hard to believe, but there are places on earth where people are making movies that do not have the standard doses of hollywood toxins.  Films that don't play to the lowest common denominator of esthetics and attention span, without shallow sentimentality or arrogant brutality, without the requisite nihilism of postmodern sophistry. This movie is the antidote to all that, and it came from one cluster of brave people who live in Japan: the Ghibli studio.  Be forewarned, once you taste the real thing - and Whisper of the Heart is a prime example - you may not be able to go back to the schlock that Hollywood dishes out.  Which will pretty much keep you out of the cinema in the U.S.  Sadly, the total output of Miyazaki and Ghibli is maybe a dozen films, not all yet translated to English  - but at least they HAVE made the magnificent films they have.

I put this film in the top 10 of any cinema I've ever seen. Story, music, design, every aspect is just right, an absolute work of Art. As with all Ghibli productions, in the first 5 minutes you'll forget it's animated. This film succeeds at encapsulating something that's essential and priceless for literally anyone, child or adult. I'd challenge anyone not to fall at least a little bit in love with Shizuku, or rather, the true feminine spirit she represents.

An additional benefit of watching this film is that you'll have some new, more interesting words to the old John Denver song.

2458895,5,B000CDGVOO,"Like chocolate milk and pancake batter, utter realism and animation rarely mix. Cartoons, completely unrestrained by the laws of physics, usually depict fanciful, imaginary, or surreal worlds and creatures that real fleshy human beings can relate to only indirectly or analogously. Talking lions, anthropomorphic toasters, ants with eyebrows, singing lawn furniture. That's the stuff of animation. ""Kid's stuff,"" at least for many living in the United States. But, across the Pacific, one of Japan's greatest animation houses, Studio Ghibli, has continually broken this tradition by incorporating human characters so believable and lifelike they could already exist two doors down. ""Whisper of the Heart"" contains realism so tangible it could work as a live action movie.

Apart from a few scenes, the entire plot of this animated film takes place within the human realm. The heroine, Shizuku Tsukishima, a junior high school student in a middle class Japanese family, faces the perennial coming of age question: ""what should I do with my life?"" Her easily distracted squirrelish mind often wanders through fairy tales and imaginary stories. She follows tangents and roads less traveled, a habit that induces her to follow a stray cat, Muta, from a public train to an antique store. Once there she discovers an enigmatic sculpture of a well dressed cat. Its eyes radiate like fiery nebulas. The store's proprietor, Shirou Nishi, refers to it as ""The Baron."" Something about this statuesque cat catches Shizuku's attention and she decides to write a fairy tale narrated by The Baron. For a few minutes the movie shifts out of reality to depict pieces of this story. But reality quickly, and harshly, returns.

Along the way Shizuku gets haunted by a name: Seiji Amasawa. This person has already checked out nearly every book she has from the library. Examining the old style checkout cards - now extinct from computerized libraries - reveals this startling pattern. She begins to fantasize about the mysteriously reoccurring name. By this point her friends have taken an interest in boys, which also piques her own interest. One friend has a stultifying crush on a somewhat brutish baseball player who wouldn't notice a flaming brick thrown at his face. Shizuku tries to set them up but falls flat into a humiliating ""whoops!"" moment. The evasive name of Seiji wafts in the background.

When Shizuku discovers the identity of Seiji Amasawa, she's disappointed and a fight ensues. Nonetheless, the two build a relationship based on the ineffable stuff that all relationships are built on. Then Seiji, in pursuit of his life's ambition, decides to move to Cremona, Italy. This throws Shizuku into an emotional abyss. She seeks the solace of her friends. The same ones that previously sought relationship advice from her. Shizuku's own flowering fairy tale confronts reality. Will this relationship work? How can it?

Allegories of lost love permeate the story. An old clock, restored by Nishi, depicts a Prince staring longingly at his true love who only appears at twelve o'clock. Nishi himself dreams about the return of his long lost love, Louise. Even in his old age he still hopes. The lonely figure of the Baron parallels this tragedy. A companion piece, a well-dressed female cat also named Louise, disappeared along with Nishi's Louise of the flesh. Life interferes with love. And, despite the ending, life appears ready to deliver a blow to Seiji and Shizuku. Arguably, the ending remains open to interpretation. The constant refrain of ""Country Roads,"" made famous by John Denver but sung here by Olivia Newton-John, hearkens those who have gone astray or wandered off to return home ""where they belong"" (at least in the minds of the amorously abandoned). Eerily, Shizuku and Seiji's story could end up mirroring Nishi's and Louise's.

""Whisper of the Heart"" is one of Studio Ghibli's most poignant and beautiful films. Adults will probably identify with its themes more than children or teenagers. It searches for magic in reality rather than in fantasy, but it challenges these dreams with the vicissitudes of workaday life. It also makes us reflect on the whispers of our own hearts that tell us what we may have lost or may potentially be in the process of losing.",1164067200,15,4275,5.1189111747851
2458896,4,B000CDGVOO,"Miyazaki wrote the screenplay so it has to be good, one way or another. This one has Miyazaki's signature elements, flying machines and an early-teen heroine, but is much more sedate than many of his more fantasy-based movies. In fact, the emphasis on relationships almost makes it a chick flick, but for the junior high set.

Still, even I enjoyed it. There's a little bit of everyday mystery in Moon and The Baron. There's more than a little of the perpetual embarassment of being 14. There are also little lessons on finding and creating your own inner strength, on earning a place in the adult world, and maybe on what it is that makes real friendship and affection.

I have to admit that I'm more of a fan of Miyazaki's fantasy/action movies. The fact that this one held my attention anyway says a lot.

2458897,3,B000CDGVOO,"It's always strange reviewing certain movies because you keep feeling like you're going to get lynched if you badmouth it. While most just simply say ""don't buy this, buy teh creed!!!111"", others go into heavy detail about why it wasn't one of their favorites. Whisper of the Heart of course has a charm about it and there's obviously nothing offensive about it such as bad acting, dialogue and such but there wasn't that kind of wonder and magic I got from Totoro, Spirited Away or even Nausicaa.

Shizuki is a high school student who impresses many with her poetry, does her chores and reads a lot of books but she's quite unhappy. She meets Seiji, a violin maker which at first she gets off on the wrong foot with but then starts to like him. Eventually she gets inspired to write a story based on the Baron, a strange cat statue found in a shop.

Many people say Spirited Away is the best Studio Ghibli film while it does have its detractors with usually a common complaint: its length. The film clocked in at a sliver over 2 hours. The Cat Returns, Whisper's ""sequel"", was at a small 1 hour and 10 or so. Whisper is at around an hour 50 and it does feel like it at times. So much stuff happened but it ultimately doesn't propel the story forward it's just a lot of stuff. The Baron in his chatty form shows up past the hour mark and his appearance is cameo at best.

Will kids love it though? I don't know, it has none of the magic that previous Ghibli films had. It's at least worth a rental but it's hard to recommend if you're thinking it's going to be another Totoro or Spirited Away.",1158624000,8,1593,4.3389261744966445

2458899,5,B000CDGVOO,"Set in the suburbs of Tokyo, ""Whisper of the Heart"" is a story of finding ones place in the real world and of finding one's first true love.  The teenage main character, Shizuku, wants to be a writer and is seeking her place in the world.  While she is a voracious reader, she reads only fantasy which tends to skew her world view.  After meeting a hansome boy, Seiji, who both infuriates and intrigues her, Shizuku sets a personal goal.  Because Seiji knows he wants to study violin making in Italy and is going there for a short apprenticeship to see if he has the skills, Shizuku sets a goal of writing a story by the time he returns in order to know conclusively if she should be a writer.  During the course of Whisper of the Heart, she learns that life and love is not as easy as in a storybook but that with hard work, one may find true love and happiness in real life as well as in stories.  A subplot is Shizuku's relationship with Seiji's Grandfather who serves as the voice of wisdom and experience.  He teaches her that many beautiful things are hidden and may only be exposed with hard work.  He also teaches that life does not always give a happy ending.

Other than the scene showing Shizuku's writing, the story has none of the strange characters, magic, or fantastic settings of other Studio Ghibli U.S. releases.  (In my opinion, some of their best real-life style stories such as ""Omoide Poro Poro"" do not translate well into American culture or the American market.)  The animation is fantastic, which I attribute to the detail Studio Ghibli includes.  This is the film which gave rise to ""The Cat's Return"" and several of the characters are found in both (the Baron, Muuta).

Regardless of the subject matter, I was easily caught up in the story and found it quite compelling.  My wife and I often set the language to Japanese with subtitles (my Japanese is abysmal) and as we found with ""Kiki's Delivery Service,"" the translation of the Japanese dialog is better than what was written for the English version.  Those with some knowledge of Japanese culture will notice some other facets of that culture which underlie the story.  These include studying for the High School admission tests and the ""Goodbyes"" of long-time classmates following junior high school.

2458913,5,B000CDGVOO,"One of the lesser-known Studio Ghibli productions, ""Whisper Of The Heart"" is also one of the most brilliant gems in a Ghibli crown that seems to be studded with nothing but brilliant gems.  It begins with two simple premises - 1) during summer vacation a book-loving girl named Shizuki discovers that the same person - a reader named Seiji - is also listed on the library cards of most of the fable-books she checks out as having checked them out also, and 2) during the simple act of taking a train to deliver her father the lunch he's forgotten to take to work, Shizuki is uncannily intrigued by a distinct cat riding the bus and decides on a whim to follow the cat off the train and see where he goes.  From these two beginnings the movie and its phenomenal cast of characters branch off in a myriad of directions.  Both hilarious in a way few live-action comedies can match and incredibly moving on a level few live-action dramas can ascend to, ""Whisper Of The Heart"" is also, undoubtedly, one of the most gorgeously romantic tales ever told.  The closest comparison, in non-animated terms, might be to imagine ""The Notebook"" crossed with ""Serendipity"" but with certain elements toned down to open the movie up for younger viewers as well as older ones.  In the transition it loses not one whit of its power, enchantment, or depth.

  It's also about a lot of other things.  It's about insecurity vs. taking the plunge.  It's about a quaint old antique shop and its owner and patrons.  It's about a striking statue of a bipedal, nattily-attired cat whose gem eyes catch and refact the sunlight in a mesmerizing way, in that shop.  It's about the value of story, it's about impromptu musical singalongs, it's about dreams vs. societal expectations, and more further tangents than can be listed here, all coming together in one extraordinary package.  Absolutely unforgettable, one of the most essential movies ever made.  Movie lovers of all tastes and stripes owe it to themselves to give this masterpiece a try.",1146009600,8,2016,4.755747126436781
2458914,5,B000CDGVOO,"Before I saw this fantastic animated masterpiece, my only contact with Japanese Anime' was when my nieces and nephews came for visits (they were interested in watching Ninja/Karate/Sailor Moon, etc). These cartoons, although hypnotic and mesmerizing to the kids, seemed mindless with no real message (not that there's anything wrong with that).

One evening this past January, I was flipping through the channels when I came upon TCM's Thursday night special tribute to Hayao Miyazaki. I listened to the pre-feature info-guy describing the great artistry and storytelling of this director and thought ""I'll give it 2 minutes and then continue flipping"".

After only ten minutes I found myself totally immersed in the experience. What a beautifully crafted, artistically amazing, and poignant study of two young Japanese students encouraging one another to follow their dreams as they surprise themselves by falling in love.

As a professional artist, I was amazed at the superb quality and artistry of the background panels, each one alone a separate masterpiece, and the 3 dimensional feel in the movement/action. This was not what I had expected.

The most striking element of this masterpiece (at the risk of being trite) was the slice of modern Japanese life/culture it imparted to me. The characters were real, while at the same time decent, moral kids. There was a certain innocence in the characters that was totally refreshing and endearing. They projected an almost spiritual reverence for their elders and total respect for their teachers. Because the Japanese culture is shown to be ""user friendly"", their parents had no fear for their kids traveling on bikes and rapid transit throughout Tokyo. It was quite charming to follow the various characters through their daily activities and reminded me of my own childhood before our American culture became so dangerous.

I now own many of Miyazaki's films including Porco Rosso, Kiki's Delivery Service, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, Castle in the Sky, and a few others. However, my personal favorite is still Whisper of the Heart. I can't wait to introduce my nieces and nephews to these fantastic and beautiful stories.",1144972800,18,2183,5.261494252873563

""Whisper of the Heart"" has no fantasy element.  The movie is about a young girl going through some emotional introspection, experiencing love for the first time, and trying to figure out what to do with her life.  It's nothing serious, she's just growing up, yet the story is compelling enough to hold your attention.

The animation is great!  Small, subtle, details pop up everywhere [just watch], giving this story and setting fantastic depth.  The background sounds are just as full and thought out, of passing cars and bicycles, and other ambient details.

Each of the characters in this film are well portrayed, from Shizuku's parents and sister, to her friends, and the old shop keeper.  [I loved the impromptu jamb session with the shop keeper, two of his friends and Shizuku singing ""Country Roads"".]

Now there is a surprise!  The main theme song of the film is ""Country Roads"" by John Denver, though they have a female vocalist.  At first it seemed a little out of place in an Anime, but it doesn't take long to fit right in.

[Note:  This is 'sort of' the prequel to ""The Cat Returns"", and in fact the 'Barron' is in this story.  However here he is only a statue, and nothing more.

The story is simple girl hates guy but eventually they fall in love with each other except this is a pure love story that isn't tainted by raunchiness or anything too old that would feel uncomfortable. It's truly the way true love stories are created and that's at an early age when it is considered as friendship first. Originally made in 95 but the animation is perfect for this type of movie and the voice actors hit the target. Whisper Of The Heart makes you wish you had the same whisper when you were this age and shows you what it could've been like if you did.,1143417600,4,777,4.292517006802721

He also has a strong male lead as well, with both coming together as a strong couple.  I can see myself watching this many times over the years, without losing any of its charm.

2458941,5,B000CDGVOO,"I first became a Studio Ghibli fan when I saw Spirited Away. As I have fallen in love with numerous films from this studio, I have no qualms purchasing films they offer without previously viewing them. Such was the case with Whisper of the Heart and I was not disappointed. This film is perhaps one of my favorite offerings from Studio Ghibli. It is down to earth and presents relatable characters in a beautifully written storyline.

Synopsis:

Our story starts out with Shizuku who is determined to read 20 books during the summer. Her father works in the local library and she can be constantly found there as well. She reads loads upon loads of books, particularly fairy tales. In fact, she reads so much that she cares for little else, friends and writing lyrics excepted, and her grades are suffering as a result. Apparently in Japan (or just in this movie) your entrance tests to high school are a huge deal. The High School you go do partly determines your success in life and the oppertunities available to you (something like that). Instead of being caring particularly about the exams Shizuku is instead facinated at solving a mystery revolving around her library books. It seems that every book she has checked out a ""Seiji Amasawa"" has checked out before her. She can't help but wonder who this boy is like.

Meanwhile, Shizuku figures out that her best friend, Yuko, likes a fellow classmate of theirs, Sugimura. After her friend leaves her this valuble piece of knowledge, Shizuku figures out she left her library book somewhere and races off to retrieve it. In the process she bumps into a boy who proceeds to insult the lyrics she had been working on (and incidentally had left in the library book that he found). Calling him a jerk all the way home, Shizuku ends up revising said lyrics, and showing them to her friends at school who are deeply impressed. Later, Shizuku is on the subway to the library to drop off a lunch for her Dad when she spots a cat on said subway. Intrigued, she follows the cat to an antique shop, leaves the lunch in the shop and once again runs into the rude boy.

Later, at school, Sugimara tries to convince Yuko to go out with a friend of his. Yuko blows up and him and leaves crying. Sugimara is crestfallen at what he could have possibly have done wrong and Yuko decides not to go to school the next day, telling the whole story to Shizuko. At school, with pleading from Sugimara, Shizuku tells the boy that her best friend has a crush on him. Sugimara then admits he's been in love with Shizuku for years. This is bad. Shizuku realizes that this is a horrible situation to be in, turns Sugimara down because she doesn't return his feelings and also would never ""steal"" her best friend's crush, and rushes over to the antique store for some solice. Who should she run into but the rude boy? The rude boy lets her into the antique shop and Shizuku finds out that the boy's dream is to be a violin maker. She also finds out that he is none other than Seigi Amasawa! But the time they spend together, between talking about a cat, an antique, and violins proves to smooth over any past rudeness and they become friends.

However, everything can't stay peaches and cream. The next day at school Seigi tells Shizuku his dream is coming true! His parents have allowed him to apprentice himself to a violin maker in Italy for 2 months. If he shows promise he will be allowed to stay, after his Jr. High graduation, but if he doesn't show promise he must go to High School. In the same conversation, Seigi admits to checking out so many books in hope that Shizuku would notice him as she always seems to have her nose stuck in a book. (Make no mistake though, Seiji still has read the books he has checked out!). Shizuku realizes that she has developed a crush on Seigi but it is all for naught as he is going away for two months. Despondant, Shizuku has tea with her best friend, Yuko, and tells her how inadaquate she feels compared to Seigi, who not only has read a lot of books, but puts his talents to use and knows what he wants to do with his life. Shizuku, determined to proove herself worthy of him, decides to use the two months to write a book, as she has been told she's a gifted writer. Inspired by one of the antiques in the store, Shizuku starts writing constantly, staying up at least once until 4 am., to the detriment of her grades. Her parents, however, say that she must follow her heart. The two months rolls along and she finishes her book. She still feels so inadaquate to Seigi and believes that she can never catch up with his ""greatness.""

This is when Seigi's grandfather, owner of the antique shop, tells her this valuable lesson. Artists are like geodes; there are valuable gems inside an ordinary rock. Now these gems can be overshadowed by the showy crystals inside, and you can waste your time polishing those. But the real gems are uncut and rough, needing not only to be unearthed but polished. You can't tell just by looking, what valuable stone a geode may contain, but that doesn't mean there isn't one inside of the rock. He also tells her that we have to keep polishing, and yes, her initial story is good, but she needs to polish it. That is when Shizuku realizes she still has a lot to learn and decides to buckle down and study for her entrance/High School exams.

Meanwhile, Seiji has returned from Italy. He too, shows promise in his craft of choice. He decides to go to High School and then pursue his dream of making violins. Seiji and Shizuku share a touching romantic moment before the film ends.

Summary help with jogs in memory by: [...] (I highly recommend this sight as it pertains to all Studio Ghibli films).

Whisper of the Heart is certainly delightful, containing many a poignant lesson on love, friendship, success, imagination, and goals. I highly recommend it!",1142985600,,5862,4.527856468366384
2458942,5,B000CDGVOO,"For me, the Ghibli films are difficult to put in an order of best to worst as whenever I think of one to put at the top, I think '..oh but then what about..'.  However, I can be pretty certain that Whisper of the Heart comes in the top three, if not at the head of my list.  It baffles me why it doesn't even get mentioned in the Studio Ghibli trailer that comes with this waves releases.

Though it centers on children on the verge of adulthood, I think its audience is meant to be a little older than that - perhaps about 20 onwards.  Whisper of the Heart is a slow-moving film, and so a child brought up on anime such as Pokemon or Dragon Ball Z may quickly become bored, so if this is a present for a youngster/teen, choose according to your childs tastes.

It, like many films centers in on a life-changing period of the protagonists' lives but on the way stops a little to show the beauty and magic of the world they inhabit.  The film is sprinkled with small, sometimes inconsequential scenes which were designed to make the viewer not outright laugh, but smile on both the outside and the inside.  One small example is where Shizuku is in the antiques shop, and as she stares into the emerald eyes of the Baron cat statue, the camera fixes on the last rays of sunshine as they disappear from the window, filtered by the branches of the tree outside.  Its only a few seconds in length but verges on the photorealistic, with a perfectly judged color pallette.  Its an incredibly calming scene and uses no 'magic' in the conventional sense of the term to delight the viewer, just the raw elements of life.  It reminded me of the Safflower fields scene in that other great Ghibli film, 'Only Yesterday'.

Occasionally, as Shizuku begins to test herself by writing her first novel, the normal world gives way to her imagination and we see several scenes drawn by INOUE Naohisa.  These scenes are suitably magical reflecting the raw ideas and imagination rushing to the front of her mind.  They represent the only fantasy element to the story and are beautiful to look at.

The music for the film, dispite Amazons' listings, were not done by Joe Hisaishi, but are still very good - the opening is 'Country Road' sung by Olivia Newton John, and the ending is a parody sung by the Japanese acress who plays Shizuku, which ends the film on a high.  In between are a selection of pleasant tunes which fit the film well.

I could describe the story more but that would be to spoil it for new viewers.  When I first watched this film it was at a screening of the original Japanese dub in Cambridge.  After it ended, I couldn't believe how relaxed and calm it made me and I sat for a good half hour in the park watching the world go by with a smile on my face.  It has that effect.

I would say however that, at least on your first viewing that if possible, please watch the original Japanese dub.  After watching the 'behind the microphone' item it became clear some of the actresses were too 'britney' for me and a few sections of the dialog were changed a bit too much for my liking.  (I listened to the english dub of the last scenes and that was more than enough).

A note about the DVD quality - though the reproduction of the film is excellent, the Japanese (but not the US) dub of the film cuts off about an inch of the top of the closing credits - cutting off the heads of the characters so you cant see the resolution of one of the story threads.  Bad Disney!  To your room!

Finally, if you liked this film for its pace, artistry and emotional impact, I recommend Haibane Renmei, which is a similarly beautiful anime series.",1142553600,6,3630,4.3725782414307
2458943,5,B000CDGVOO,"""Whisper of the Heart"" is a wonderfully simple story, filled with characters that you genuinely care about, namely that of Shizuku, a struggling teenager who is trying to discover herself.  Through the course of the movie, she discovers her talents, and gains a renewed desire to make her dreams a reality.",1142467200,3,306,5.0
2458944,5,B000CDGVOO,"Yoshifumi Kondo's first and only film for Studio Ghibli (he died a few years after it was completed), WHISPER OF THE HEART, is an absolute delight.  Gentle but not syrupy, this modern-day story about a girl and boy discovering that they have a lot in common is beautifully animated, compellingly characterized, and full of heart (pun intended).

Based on a graphic-novel by Aoi Hiragi with a script by Hayao Miyazaki, the movie centers on Shizuku Tsukishima, a spacey yet sympathetic young High School student who would rather read books from the library rather than study for her school tests.  Shizuku discovers that a certain Seiji Amasawa checks out the same books that she does, as detailed on the library checkout cards.  When Shizuku first meets Seiji in person, she thinks he's a ""stupid jerk"" (he makes a somewhat snide remark about her supposedly ""corny"" writing abilities), but she soon discovers that he is a strangely gentle fellow who longs to become a violinist yet feels that his playing isn't as good as others say it is.  Shizuku can relate to this, given that she doubts her talents as a writer.  The story takes a dramatic turn when Shizuku discovers that Seiji will be temporarily leaving for Italy to train as a violinist.  This inspires Shizuku to pursue her own talent, and she proceeds to write her first story.

At the surface, this would sound like a rather simple love story, but that's not all WHISPER OF THE HEART has going for it.  Miyazaki's screenplay ingeniously allows the viewers to identify with Shizuku as she expresses the following emotions:  frustration, disappointment, fear, joy, and vulnerability.  This is displayed not only in her growing relationship with Seiji, but with her daily interactions with her friends, family, and her inner thoughts.  We even see Shizuku deal with humiliation (and even guilt) when a boy reveals he had a crush on her all along, yet she only considered him a friend.  Sometimes certain movies can delve a little too much on these angst-ridden elements, but in WHISPER OF THE HEART, this is handled in a way that is not so overbearing (or frustrating even) to the viewer.

The film also works in a subplot involving a captivating antique shop containing all kinds of sparkling treasures, including a charming statuette of a cat known as ""Baron"".  The kindly owner, Mr. Nishi, is warm and supportive of Shizuku, especially when she decides to write her story based on the aforementioned ""Baron"" statue. He reminded me of Uncle Pom from CASTLE IN THE SKY, a similarly gentle old man who sadly only showed up for one scene; having this kind of character play an even bigger role in WHISPER is a delight.

Speaking of which, the scenes where Shizuku imagines her story are among the movie's most imaginatively animated moments.  The film's artwork, typical of Ghibli, is top notch, but this sequence (one of the studio's first experiments with computer animation) is especially stunning.  Here we see the Baron come alive and escort a fair young maiden (who strangely resembles Shizuku) across a graceful sky of floating islets.  The character of the Baron is quite charismatic and one of the more memorable characters in the film; the only other notable feline we see is a pudgy furball known as Moon (aka Muta), who appears quite grumpy whenever Shizuku tries to talk to him.

Incidentally, both of these felines appeared in another Studio Ghibli production, THE CAT RETURNS, a pleasant but merely forgettable family flick considered by many (myself included) as an inferior spin-off.  Not that Hiroyuki Morita's film doesn't have any charm, but WHISPER has something that THE CAT RETURNS didn't have, hence why it holds up better.

Interestingly, John Denver's immortal ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"" plays a crucial part in the story:  the first half of the movie deals with Shizuku trying to translate the song into Japanese.  This part of the story obviously gave Disney a lot of problems in terms of translation, hence why it was delayed from its English release for quite some time.  Fortunately, their dub handles it in a way that remains true to the original intent, yet at the same time makes it easier for American audiences to connect with.  Here Shizuku tries to write her own lyrics for the song, with each attempt improving as she learns to write from the heart.  This approach works rather well, as I could sense little, if any, lost in the translation.

As much as I've heard people criticize Disney for the actors they've chosen to voice the characters in their dubs for Ghibli's works, I have practically enjoyed every one of their voice casts--and, in the case of WHISPER OF THE HEART, I think cynics are going to be very hard-pressed to find any real fault with the performers assembled here.  As the insecure Shizuku, Brittany Snow speaks in a very expressive, believable way without being saccharine, and has an equally lovely singing voice.  David Gallagher--no stranger to voice acting, given his work in KINGDOM HEARTS--provides an excellent contrast to Snow through his understated yet effective turn as Seiji.  Cary Elwes reprises his role as the debonair Baron from THE CAT RETURNS.  The person who takes the prize for best acting in the dub, though, is Harold Gould, who brings just the right amount of warmth, poignancy, and compassion to the kindly Mr. Nishi.

I had heard so many wonderful things about WHISPER OF THE HEART, but I never expected to like it as much as I did.  And now that it is available as yet another top-notch dub from Disney (although their DVD extras are a little bit sparse here; good thing the movie looks fantastic though), it pleases me that this film will hopefully discover an even wider audience.  All in all, WHISPER OF THE HEART is a real winner as both a Studio Ghibli film and a Disney revamp, and I highly recommend it.",1142380800,10,5856,4.8453815261044175
2458945,5,B000CDGVOO,"Having purchased this film knowing nothing of it but its pedigree (the wonderful Ghibli Studio whose other terrific films I was familiar with), I couldn't believe in retrospect how fortunate I was that I took such a chance. The last time I felt this enchanted with an animated film was the first time I saw ""Spirited Away"" in the theater (although ""Wallace and Gromit"" runs a close second). The film moves from strength to strength, filled with naturalistic dialogue, convincing voices and stunning animation. But what makes it extraordinary is the charming, emotionally resonant story. The filmmakers have captured the moments in every child's life when they first feel the inklings of adult love. That they do so in such a sensitive manner with three dimensional characters portrayed visually in two dimensions only makes the accomplishment that much greater. No matter your own age, this film will be a revelation to you, as it was to me.",1142035200,3,941,5.0
2458946,5,B000CDGVOO,"Ghibli studio in Japan give's American studios a run for it's money. They don't need to make their cartoon movies in 3D in order to make it good animation like the U.S. does all the time. Cause America lost it's talent in doing hand drawn cartoons.

I have never seen such a touching love story between two young people, driving each other to achieve their aim in life by doing self-discovery. What makes me realize is we don't have to know someone in real life to push ourselves to achieve something. They can be far away from us or a stranger to be our role model in life.

This story can occur in reality and who knows? The story line is simple but very interesting. It also makes you think whether you have such an inspiration in life, whether our partner give us an inspiration in doing what we want in life or just live another day.",1141689600,3,838,4.3312101910828025

2458948,5,B000CDGVOO,"Whisper of the Heart is based on a screenplay by Hayao Miyazaki, which he adapted from a comic by Aoi Hragi.  The story focuses on a teenage girl who is to find out about life's difficult journey, as she discovers a mysterious name in a library book.  Nonetheless, it is not a conventional teenage coming of age story that have already been made so many times.

The teenage years are the bridge from childhood to adulthood in which the child discovers itself in a process people call coming of age.  Whisper of the Heart is such a story about the young teenage girl Shizuku who does what every good girl is supposes to do -- obey her parents.  Parents often try to steer their children in a well-trodden path where mistakes are minimized and choice are limited as the future is important.  Thus, it is essential that children obey the parent's wishes and desires as they usually have more knowledge and wisdom.

One of the demands that the parents put on their children is to study.  In Japan the school system puts a lot of pressure on the teens, as they have to take hard entrance exams right before they enter high school, which means the students who get into high school usually spend the majority of their summer studying for exams.  Shizuku, who is a good girl, does a lot of studying when she does not read books, which is one of her favorite pastimes.

Shizuku makes many visits to the library where her father works and she borrows large numbers of books.  Through the old way of keeping the records of who borrowed what book Shizuku discovers the name Amasawa Seiji on more than one of the books that she has borrowed.  This begins an innocent and secretive romance for Shizuku who uses her imagination to create an image for Amasawa.  Despite this beginning, Whisper of the Heart is not a teenage love story, yet love is an important part of the film as it illustrates the complexity of being a teen.

When Shizuku does not read she translates and writes her own poetry, carries food to her father at work, and helps out with the house chores.  In the summer heat she even finds time for a little friendship, which is huge element of being a teen.  The ability to socialize with friends is affected by what they do most of the time, which is studying for the entrance exams.  In one of these moments she provides a translation of John Denver's Take Me Home, Country Road of which she has also created in her own Japanese version.  This is an interesting scene as it displays how hard these teens work even when they are relaxing.

On one of Shizuku's short ventures with food to her father who is working a stray cat leads her astray.  The cat leads her unintentionally into a small antique shop owned by an old man.  In this store she gets to hear the story of Baron Humbert von Gikkingen, a cat statue, which becomes the foundation for the film Cat Returns (2002).  Shizuku also meets a young teenage boy who dreams of becoming a violinmaker and who dreams of going to Italy to study violinmaking.  Through this teenage boy she learns to look into herself in order to discover what she desires to do with her life.

Shizuku sets out on a quest to discover if she has what it takes to become a writer and she drops her studies and focuses solely on writing.  Her older sister becomes irritated over her lack of respect for her parents and her parents are bewildered to see how she is changing.  The film does not simply imply that one should follow ones dreams.  Rather, it takes the notion one step further by applying hard work, dedication, and desire to the idea of following ones dreams.  Thus, it does not become a pretentious teenage film, which often teaches the superficial value of ""follow thy dreams"".  Instead, it provides a realistic perspective on success, as most of it is due to hard work and rarely only dreams and hopes.

In this process Shizuku comes of age as she discovers what she wants to do while applying dedication and zealous work ethic to what she loves the most.  Yet, the film is not only about ""follow thy dreams"", it is about so much more.  As mentioned beforehand she falls in love with this mysterious Amasawa, has friendships that go through difficult times, experiences hurt feelings, has looming exams, goes through failure, and deals with whatever else life presents. In essence, Whisper of the Heart is about coming of age while dealing with the ups and downs of life. The film does not focus on one of the moments in life, but rather on the journey through life as Shizuku is acquiring wisdom.

Whisper of the Heart is a brilliant animated film by Yoshifumi Kondo who unfortunately passed away in 1998, which makes Whisper of the Heart the only film that he directed.  Kondo worked as an animator on wonderful animated films such as Grave of Fireflies (1988), Kiki's Delivery Service (1989), Porco Rosso (1992), and Princess Mononoke (1997).  It is sad to know that his visual talent and skill never got to make more flawless cinematic experiences such as Whisper of the Heart, which still has not been released in the United States.  Hopefully, this film will also reach this nation as it has so much to offer in the sense of entertainment, enlightenment, and contemplative bemusement.",1140048000,15,5238,4.588614393125671
2458949,5,B000CDGVOO,"I collect anime, and have recently had the opportunity to see the dub of this great work on TCM before it's released on DVD.  I've owned the subtitled version for a few years now, and was impressed that no newer anime movies can even touch the quality of animation displayed in this film.  Yes, the story is good although I'd call it less a coming of age film and more a exploring our youthful options type of story.  This is a slice of life type of movie, not an action or an adventure. It's interest is in how well it can capture the audience.

Capture you it does.  I recently showed a friend of mine three animations.  The first was a nicely done anime episode of a series called Bleach.  The second to show the higher level of detail was Mulan, a Disney animation, with at least some footing into their cel movies.  Finally, I showed Whisper of the Heart.  The first was fine for most watching as are most decent anime series, the art and characters don't get in the way of the viewing.  The second was a Disney theatrical release which is as good as can normally be expected.  Decent detail and some nice visual effects to help drive the movie plot.

Then there was Whisper...  Here's a little test if you don't believe me straight up.  Watch the sequence where the girl follows the cat up to the antique shop.  I've never seen such an attention to detail as this before.  That an artist could render drawings of a city scape with this much detail and realism, is flat out amazing.  I've seen animators blog on their extra's disc about the challenge to accomplish some special effect in an animated movie or series.  Looking at it from their perspective, I could see the difficulties.  Then looking at it from what was accomplished in this film, I think they are just whining over minor details.

Here are some more good examples in this film, check out the color changes with the lighting at night and in the morning at the student desk in the bedroom.  Check out the many transparencies and translucencies from glass doors and windows.  Check out the subtle motions of background items, and the detail and functionality.  Nothing seems like an after thought, or out of place.  The items the characters use and react too, always seem to have function.  Even the special grandfather clock in the antique store, while imaginative somewhat, still looked and operated like it could have been real.

The style of Miyasaki characters are is on display here as well.  He must have provided some of the drawings, if only in conceptual mode for this film.  What is amazing for him is that he can create characters that are obvious animations. This is in contrast to the growing trend to create photorealistic characters, in mostly rendered animation.  Instead Miyasaki characters are simple in their appearance, and features. Yet, they react to the incredibly detailed backgrounds, and all blend together to form a smooth animation without seeming busy or cluttered.  This is one of those films that sneaks up on you.  You find you can remember the story long after its over with.  It's a pity most animated films don't have craftsmen of this level of talent.  Other studios, have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on other film projects that were so ill conceived, a focus group of children could have told them they were bad!

If you read the plot summary of this film you will not want to watch it, so don't.  Just view the film when you are relaxed, and you'll have an unforgettable experience.  Studio Ghibli films tend to be like that.  This one doesn't do any environmental or political preaching like a few of them are known to do.  It simply entertains, and shows off animes to be a true art form, a fact that is often overlooked in the commercial world of crank them out, and get them to market, cookie cutter animations.",1139270400,23,3833,4.59882005899705

8097853,4,B000CDGVOO,"Anyone who is a fan and lover of animation has (and should) seen at least one film by Studio Ghibli, and its acclaimed writer and director, Hayao Miyazaki. His beautiful and stunning movies are known the world over, and has inspired artists everywhere. But although I've grown up with many of his films, there ARE still a few I have yet to see for various reasons. And I'm embarrassed to say this was one of them. Though, to be fair, it seems this film doesn't get as much attention as Ghibli's other, more famous works. And it's a shame, because the messages presented here are ones that anyone, young or old, can take to heart.

Shizuku is a middle school student on the cusp of entering high school, though between her dating problems, a busy family that has little time for her, and an older sister who's constantly berating her for ""being lazy"" and not having her life figured out, Shizuku finds it increasingly difficult to focus on her studies, and would much rather lose herself in a good book--wishing her life were more like a fairy tale. But things suddenly take an interesting turn one day when Shizuku spots a stray cat riding the train with her; even weirder when it gets off at the same stop as her. Curious, she follows the cat to see where it goes, to which it leads her to an antique shop, run by an old man and his grandson, Seiji, who's in training to become a violin maker. And when she learns the backstory behind the mysterious Cat Baron statue in the shop (while also striking up a budding romance with Seiji), Shizuku will realize her dreams of becoming a writer...and maybe finally get her life together.

The visuals and animation, as per usual in a Miyazaki film, are utterly breathtaking to look at and watch. The amount of sheer detail put into every background and character movement is incredible. But unlike a lot of Miyazaki's other films, this movie is just a straight up drama about a girl figuring out what she wants out of life. There's no magic or fantasy elements what so ever, save for just a couple dream sequences as Shizuku tries to write her novel. Anyone, especially writers or artists, can connect with Shizuku as she struggles to figure out what her talents are and ""prove"" her self-worth, both to herself and to Seiji, who she feels is miles ahead of her in terms of knowing what he wants and making his dreams happen.

And though the movie can be a bit slow-moving at times (it's not until more than a third of the way in that the real plot finally gets going), a patient viewer will be rewarded as the lessons it hammers home are important for everyone to learn. Though it can be frustrating, you don't have to get things perfect on the first try, and it's okay to not have your life totally figured out. What's important is to try and not compare yourself to others and just focus on your own self improvement.

With likeable characters and a timeless message, this is the perfect film to watch when you feel like you're at a crossroads in your life, or you feel like you're not good enough to accomplish your dreams. Only by daring to be different and taking the road less traveled can you sometimes discover just how talented you really are.",1523836800,,3195,4.512953367875648

8097855,4,B000CDGVOO,Good movie. Just what ive come to expect from a Ghibli film. I seen The Cat Returns first so i considered this kind of a prequel. This i guess would be by only complaint about the movie without giving anything away.  I just thought it would be different than what it turned out to be. Still a great movie though.,1523664000,,312,4.2
