About the age of 2/3yrs I found the signing time series was easier for them to sit and watch (of which I limit their overall TV time to 1-2hrs per week!). Compared to baby signing DVDs these present the words slower and there's no constant song during the word but the words are ""tied"" together in song at the end of the lesson. Overall what Rachel has created has given my kids another language to use which helps us the parents understand what they are trying to communicate as well as teach them when we see things. Whenever and wherever we go we repeat the signs with the kids and they are excited when they can show us their signs!",1319673600,,876,5.401459854014599

8236269,5,B000ZN71R2,"I have three girls- 5, 2 and 10 months- and they all love the Signing Time series. We borrowed many signing DVDs from the library, and this is the only series I think is worth buying. The songs and repetition are wonderful. My 5 year old learns the signs for fun and to communicate with her sister. My 2 year old learned the signs as her first form of communication, has all the signs to every video we have memorized, and still loves to watch them over and over. My 10 month old is already using three signs on a regular basis. I recommend this series to everyone.",1199318400,2,565,4.2407407407407405
