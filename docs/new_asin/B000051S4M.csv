1387387,4,B000051S4M,"I have the whole series on VHS and I definately want to get the DVDs.  My tapes are starting to be a little bad after friends viewed them a lot.  And it was reported that they got a new master to transfer to the DVDs so there's an even HIGHER quality for the DVDs.  Plus lots of juicy extras.  What reason do I have NOT to buy them?  Characters are loveable, you'll be attached to one of the characters, relating to them.  Cherry forever!  Yes, I am attached to people who can cook heh, anyway, a good buy!",981158400,3,506,4.1020408163265305
1387408,4,B000051S4M,"I generally agree with the reviewers above, but felt compelled to add a few details:
Some have commented on the poor quality of the English dub.  I actually thought it was fairly well done.  The difference, I think is that I watched the English dub first, so I had no preset expectations.  The English casting IS very different from the Japanese.
I thoroughly enjoyed this show, but had to heavily suspend my disbelief to do it.  As an example, any high school biology student can tell you that you can make women from the genetic material of men with the most basic of manipulation techniques.  There are other areas as well where the plot is not tight.  That's OK, though; this show is about characters.
The characters are what makes this show.  Lime is absolutely adorable, possibly one of my favorite chacaters ever (I've been collecting anime since 1984!) Also, it is facinating watching all the marionettes grow from being machines with preprogrammed emotional responses to become real people.",1003104000,,999,4.875739644970414
1387409,4,B000051S4M,"If you're looking for some serious anime, with lots of guns, explosions, gratuitious violence and sex then don't look here. If you're looking for something fun with no redeeming social message, this might be what you're looking for.
It's an enjoyable romp through the life of one man, and the trials that come with having 3 marionettes of his own. There are laughs, obvious jokes and generally a fun feeling about it all.
The only downside to it is the absolutely *terrible* English dubbing. With the possible exception of ""Bloodberry"", the voices just do not work. And yes, part of it has to do with the fact that that perennial favourite voice artist ""Megumi Hayashibara"" does the voice of Lime to such a degree that anybody else is unworthy of that role.
All in all I have to give it a 4, it's not perfect but it's better than average.",994118400,,838,4.593333333333334
1387410,4,B000051S4M,"This series is definitely a keeper.. Even with it's extravagant comedy scenes and wacky characters, this series also manages to add a sweet story of love, compassion, and the human heart.
Although for the most part this series is full of side stories and nonsense humor (mainly involving a man loving side character named Hanagata) the episodes always ontain a moral involving the human heart. Starting off right away, the main character Otaru accidently discovers a hidden marionette named Lime. Marionettes are machines created to replace the human girl on the planet Terra II, but the strange thing about Lime is that she somehow has the same emotions and personality as a real human... And she has falen for Otaru, her new master!
This series is not for one on a feminist kick or for even one who is compelled to cry at any highly emotional scene, for it contains men using marionettes as emotionless servants and also has scenes so compacting they will even leave the hard-hearted in tears. At times the animation is a little so-so, but overall it is a very rewarding piece of work.
This is one series that is under-rated but really should not be missed...",993513600,3,1161,4.781094527363184
1387411,5,B000051S4M,"As other reviewers have noted, SMJ is very funny, nicely animated, and has many memorable characters--I mean really, how can you not like Lime, Cherry and Bloodberry (to say nothing of Panther, Luchs and Tiger?).  What I appreciate, however, is the evident care that the producers put into creating the world of Terra II. It certainly is fascinating to see nations similar--but not identical--to ones on Earth (Japoness, Gartland, Peterburg, New Texas, etc.), and that's certainly unusual because anime, naturally, tends to be pretty focused on Japan.
Curiously, the central curiosity of Terra II--that it is a world without women--is not addressed as directly as I would like.  Without being too indelicate, one wonders how fully the marionettes (most of whom lack true emotions) stand in for actual women in that society.  Certainly, the discomfort of Otaru with his rather effeminate male friend makes one wonder about that.
However, that didn't bother me enough to make me not like the series; it is very entertaining, and--although it touches on heavy themes like politics and war--the overall tone is very light and breezy.  Maybe there's a little too much goofiness in places, but the tone is funny when it should be funny, and tender when it should be tender.  Certainly, any anime fan should consider adding this to his or her collection.",991267200,,1347,5.076923076923077
1387412,5,B000051S4M,"This is probably one of the best animes I have ever had the pleasure of watching.  The characters are very well developed, and there is plenty of action, and comedy.  Not to mention surprises.  If you are a big fan of shows like Tenchi Muyo, then you will LOVE this series.",989107200,,273,4.313725490196078
1387413,5,B000051S4M,"Saber Marionette J was originally transmitted in 1996 in Japan. In the Saber Marionette ""universe"" there are the original series Saber Marionette J (25 episodes), Saber Marionette J Again (1997, 6-episode direct-to-video release) and Saber Marionette J to X (1998, 26 episodes).
This first DVD contains the first 9 episodes... the beginning of it all. This is by far the best anime series I've had the pleasure of watching. All my family has already watched all of Saber Marionette (all the way up to J to X), even my 45-year-old mom, my brother and my sister, and have enjoyed it greatly. It has no nudity and very little violence. (And violence is not an integral part of the story, anyway.)
The DVD has the original Japanese language, plus English and Spanish audio tracks. I've watched the episodes in Japanese (English subtitled), English AND Spanish. If you understand Spanish you are in for a great surprise, as the Spanish dub is one of the best dubs I've ever heard. It's totally cool.
As an extra, you get a musical video of one of the main characters in Saber Marionette. I've watched it more than 20 times already. First watch all 9 episodes, then go have a look at the musical video. (Highly recommended: turn on the subtitles for the video, you'll know what the opening song says, and you'll see that it fits the video perfectly.) The more episodes of Saber Marionette you get to watch, the more you'll enjoy the video.
The image quality is very good. The second DVD may present a problem with some players, where you will not be able to enter the Setup screen to change language/subtitles. The default is English audio... anyway, you can use the DVD remote or controls to change it manually while the disc plays. (My DVD player had no problems at all, but one of my friend's did.)
To sum it all up: Highly recommended. And if you like J, you still have J Again and J to X to look forward to, all highly recommended also.",988502400,13,1935,4.595375722543353
1387414,5,B000051S4M,Everyone else is talking about the story so I'll talk about the DVD.  My DVD had problems due to a scratch on the  disc but rubbing alcohol fixed it ^^ (Which is great since I bought it at an Anime Con and have no way of returning it).  Moving on...  This DVD is run the way all DVDs should be ran!  There are two subtitles: one for the talking and one for the Japanese writing.  Every DVD should have the option of turning all subs off for anyone wanting it in raw japanese form.  The DVD has a slightly different script from the VHS and the video is of the japanese version that aired in Japan.  This two disk DVD collection is a great buy and a must for any anime collector's collection!,988243200,2,690,4.135338345864661
1387415,5,B000051S4M,"This is a story about a world with only men. The only thing they have even close to a female is a robot-doll, called a marionette. The unlucky boy, Otaru, who does not have the financial values to own one, stumbles upon his own marionettes, Lime, Cherry, and Bloodberry.
This series has it's comedy and drammatical effects. While Lime, the childish marionette is cute running around making us laugh, there is still the moments where the story comes into play and causes a major effect dramatically.
I'd recommend getting this whole series, it was one of my favorite so far.",986083200,,573,4.74
1387416,1,B000051S4M,"Saber Marionette is one of my favorite anime series but there are enough minor glitches on this collection to drive fans nuts. This is why I rated this disc 1-star and not 4.  I've exchanged SMJ several times and tried it on numerous DVD players including Sony, Go Video, PS2 and Panasonic  with the same results. The biggest bug is on the second disc on this collection. Accessing the set up menu to change language tracks will automatically stop the disc. This is a really annoying glitch since activation of the subtitles via the remote doesn't work on all DVD players. The second noticable glitch effects both discs. The gap between chapters produces louder than normal disc accessing sounds from your player. Bug number three, you may experience ""disc error"" when you view extras and trailers, however, this only happens once in a while. All problems were also reported by others on bulliten boards so I believe it's more than a single bad batch. So if you can live with such an obviously defective disc, by all mean buy it because SMJ is a lot of fun. Otherwise wait until Bandai addresses this problem.",985737600,3,1109,4.711340206185567
1387417,5,B000051S4M,"Saber Marionette J.  I heard it had Megumi in it.  I heard it was popular.  I heard it had comedy in it.  So I purchased it.  I expected it to be about a 3 or 4 star series but I was surprised.
When I inserted the DVD I quickly started the first episode not expecting much.  As I suspected the first half of the first ep. was bad and boring (99% of Anime starts this way).  Then it picked up.  And god did it ever pick up.  Midway through the third episode I knew what had happened.  Time had been distorted, I had remained in one position for an uncomfortably long period of time and I was laughing quite a lot.  All of the indications of a good series.  Just how good?  Well...I will say that for the first time in a long while I have finally met a series with all the wit, comedy, and plot of Slayers.  The big question was it equal to or has it surpassed Slayers?  I'm not sure of the answer yet...but after I see the next DVD and the rest of the eps.  I will have the answer.  Right now I beleive that it can and may quite easily surpass Slayers for my all-time favorite series.",983664000,3,1083,4.009389671361502
7929441,5,B000051S4M,"Enjoyable sci-fi harem comedy. In a plot device similar to the sci-fi series ""Van Dread"", a space colonization ship
malfunctions, and the male colonists are marooned on an earth-like planet. Without women.
They cope with this by cloning new generations of humans and by constructing somewhat limited robotic
women called ""Marionettes"". Centuries go by, then one day, in the nation of ""Japoness"", our hero,
good-natured loser Otaru, accidently activates three long-lost Marionettes built with circuitry that
allows them to think, feel, and act like real women. And to squabble over Otaru, of course.
At the same type, the fascist dictator of the nation of Gartlant is planning world conquest through a
series of blitzkreig-like campaigns against his neighbors, and Otaru and the girls find themselves
caught up in an interesting re-writing of history, where honorable Japan must save the world
from tyrannical Germany.
The psychology of this aside, the entire series is great fun.",1385942400,,979,5.363636363636363

7929443,5,B000051S4M,"Otaru lives on a planet inhabited only by men. The people have created marionettes that look like women to fulfill their desires; whether they be for working, fighting or anything else. These marionettes are pretty much devoid of emotion and personality. They can be very cold. Otaru, however, has stumbled upon 3 marionettes with ""maiden"" circuits. This allows them to have personalities and emotions. Lime, Cherry, and Bloodberry are Otaru's marionettes. They live together but are drawn into a war to save their country from a foreign invader. Saber Marionettes are the ultimate weapon in this war; and Otaru's girls are on the front lines.

This series is pretty over the top, but tons of fun. It's been around a while, so the animation and music is very outdated. After watching it a little you can get used to it. The action and comedy are so much fun that they overshadow the other flaws with the series. Saber Marionette J reminds me a lot of Vandread. The premise is pretty similar. This is a very fun series to watch. I think that just about every anime fan can find something to love about this series.",1355184000,,1113,4.707692307692308
7929444,5,B000051S4M,"All my previous attempts at watching anime were a failure, but one of my friends persuaded me to take just a brief glance at the first episode of Saber Marionette J. Since then, I have been completely enthralled. The series is a pleasant mixture of romance and grave events going on in the background - to be unleashed upon the whole of Terra II in the end. But the thing that distinguishes the series from the average is the catching self-irony, which protects the anime from becoming kitsch. This hilarious humour is much more evident in the first episodes - as the great, complex events slowly unfold, the story gets darker and ever more melodramatic. In fact, it is arguable whether it was a good decision to give it a completely happy ending, after the things that happen (well, at least this way it was possible to continue the series with Saber Marionette J to X). The Japanese voice-actors are great (it is interesting that the main male character Mamiya Otaru is being dubbed by an actress), as well as the animation. The whole series is full with mild erotic content - rather to add to the humorous side of the story than to be serious. The characters are complex and filled-out, though after a while they inevitably start to become increasingly predictable. And that leads to the only attribute of the series I didn't approve of: as the plot progresses, some scenes get soaked up with melodrama, almost to the point of distastefulness. Nevertheless, this is not very bothering, because the unfolding plot and the morale that shines through compensate for it. I would recommend Saber Marionette J to anyone craving for some romance, humour and action, arranged in an enjoyable and consistent way. All in all, the whole series is just very touching. A must-have for old anime-fans, too, though they have probably seen it.",1145145600,,1830,4.7760252365930596
7929445,5,B000051S4M,"This was one of the first and, frankly, still one of the best.  Tenchi Muyo, Hellsing, Trigun, Love Hina and the rest are good.  But Lime, Cherry and Bloodberry was my first love among the anime series.  The extras with the music videos, hidden easter egg with the interviews, the humor and sometimes touching scenes made the episodes in this set of discs and the other two collections PERFECT.  The interaction between the characters and the complex plot, with the stand alone episodes, make it worth the price and open the door to the other series of the Saber Marionette universe. While the other stories set in the same setting are fun, this is the superior of them all.  And I happen to be a fan of Tiger!  Hubba-hubba!",1109289600,,724,4.573643410852713
7929446,5,B000051S4M,"Saber Marionette is definetely one of the best anime out there, if not the best. Loveable Lime, Cherry, and Bloodberry really bring out anime, not to mention Otaru! Anyway, to anyone, I really recommend you buy this fantastic anime! I love you Otaru!",1026259200,,250,4.837209302325581
7929447,5,B000051S4M,"I heard really good stuff about this series and I had wanted to purchase it for a long time. I ended up having really high expectations for it, aghhh I tried so hard not to do that, you're just asking to be dissapointed. Lucky for me, I was not let down. Man, this show is hilarious. The first couple episodes, I admit, started out kinda lame. I didn't really like the first marionette he found, Lime. By the third episode tho' I was just like ""I LUUUUUV this series"". The other robot girls he finds are way cooler than the first and the main character is actually pretty cool himself. That's right, unlike every other anime I can think of where dorky guy that isn't great with girls, is suddenly surrounded by ones that adore him, this guy actually seems worthy of them. He's drawn pretty cute and doesn't have a total doormat personality (tho' he does stand by the typical indecisiveness with his girls, the ""i love them all"" theory).
I also like his english dubbed voice. Yuck, It sounds like a woman is doing his voice in the japanese version, darn it and I'm just too lazy to find out if it is or not for sure. But anyway it sounds like it and I can't picture him being manly when he sounds so feminine. So that's why I like the dub, it's pretty good. The japanese is awesome too tho', the voice actresses doing Lime and Cherry are really admirable.
So anyway, it takes a couple episodes to get into but this is a great series. All right!, and it come with nine episodes, that's more than enough to get hooked. I greatly recommmend everyone give this show a try. My only regret is now I gotta scrounge up another 90 bucks so I can buy the last two collections ^.^",1024704000,,1668,4.3152866242038215
7929448,5,B000051S4M,"I already seen the whole series on video tape. And I watched so much that I had to get it on DVD, because the tapes were getting worn. When I first saw it, it grabbed my attention as to how adorable Lime was. And as the other marionettes Cherry and Bloodberry showed up the story got only more interesting and fun. I am in my twenties I must admit and since I was a kid I watched alot of the old animes, but when I saw this one I was thrust back into the whole anime scene. It is one of those stories that hasn't been told like any other, it has comedy and heart-break and alot of suspense, with twists of emotion with the characters, that make you feel like you were right there with them, and wish that you could be a part of it. Not many stories I see where I feel sorry for the villians as much as the heroes, but as the story goes on you come to like all the characters, even the very one minded and irreversibly annoying Mitsurugi Hanagata. if you are a anime fan and have not seen this let alone heard of it you must give this one a shot, I still remember the first time I saw it and I always smile when I watch it since. This has to be one of the best and most unique stories ever told, please don't hesitate to get it. The only thing that I was worried about was that the next set of stories wouldn't match up to the first season. But I was wrong, but that is another review for another time. I really hope that this helped you, and I apologize that I didn't go into more detail but when you get it ( yes I am confident with that ) you will be glad that I didn't, and didn't ruin all the suspense for you. This is definately one for the ages.",1024012800,2,1651,3.946107784431138

This anime is definetly one of the best out there. Funny, cute, great music and added effects, everything you could ever want in an anime.
What's there not to like, (excluding cough cough the Haganata [i think that's how you spell it] issue, I find that perverted, but it's funny watching him get beat up.)^_^;;
Lime, Cherry and Bloodberry are so well played out and the voice actors are awsome! 'specially Megumi (plays Lime) one of my fav. Japanese voice actress as well as singer^^
Well, there isn't much else to say because by reading the other reviews, you basically discover the plot.
On this DVD, you can play it in Spanish, Japanese and English, but I  highly recommend the Japanese version with subtitles, because this anime originated in Japan, and obviously the Japanese version is cuter, more understandable and just plain BETTERRRRR!!! so watch the original version in Japanese before you get mixed opinions about it by watching the English first(which i haven't seen, but I can tell you, Japanese voice actors are MUCH better than American ones [this is very well demonstrated in Cardcaptor Sakura(Jap version) and Cardcaptors(English version), but I won't get into that>.< ])

This story is about a world with only men, so they must create ""marionettes', or robotic women.  A guy named Otaru happens to be chosen by three of the six special marionettes that can experience feelings and have minds of their own.  The marionettes, since they are not human, have spectial powers, like great strength.
