8084435,5,B000BB1NGS,"A group of scientist  proving once again that Gods word, the Bible, is scientifically sound on matters that human researchers discovered only at a later date. This documentary  describes how things happened and is in accordance to what God told us thru is word. People should watch it and come to their own conclusion, that is your prerogative. Keep in mind that before Cristobal Colon, a Scriptures reading person, was brave enough to get on a wooden ship and go around the world, because of his faith that the Bible was right when it told us that the Earth was in fact a sphere and not flat. Isaiah 40:22 says: There is One who is dwelling above the circle of the earth. In ancient times the general opinion was that the earth was flat. It was not until over 200 years after this Bible text had been written that a school of Greek philosophers reasoned that the earth likely was spherical, and in about another 300 years a Greek astronomer calculated the approximate radius of the earth. But the idea of a spherical earth was not the general view even then. Only in the 20th century has it been possible for humans to travel by airplane, and later into outer space and even to the moon, thus giving them a clear view of the circle of earths horizon. This DVD explains logically why we can find water in space and where did the first humans started filling up the earth. This is not about religion, its about objective science and the a book completed over 1,900 years ago, even when powerful men, from emperors to religious leaders, tried desperately to eradicate the Bible.",1395360000,,1576,4.565371024734982
8084436,5,B000BB1NGS,"Fallen man hates God period. So those who cling to evolution in whatever strength will gasp, shriek, cringe and cry foul at the mention of His name together with science. Truth is truth though and we all can't run away from it though many many try. They will trash scientific proof that is contrary to their faith in evolution. ""Crack open a COLLEGE level biology book"" they will say as though it's not known the radicals in this country have systematically been pushing Judeo/Christianity out of the public schools and injecting their presuppositional ""There is no God"" pseudo science no different than the current ""science"" of Global Warming.  Anyone who opposes them is marginalized and discredited as legit. Some are at least honest to say in one way or another that they would rather believe in a lie than believe in God (knowing that true science bankrupts evolution). I HIGHLY recommend if you're intrested in also learning more on this ""science war"" by getting the DVD ""Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed"" by Ben Stein. It's NOT a Christian movie but greatly touches and treats this subject very well. Also recommended for a lighter treatment on the matter is ""Uncensored Science: Bill Nye Debates Ken Ham"" DVD. Both available here in Amazon, but back to this video review.

This video is not a pulpit pounder but actually talks first in great detail about the two theories making the rounds of evolution's preaching circles of what caused the dinosaurs to become extinct (astroid or hyper volcanic activity). Then it brings in the scientific evidence of the deluge as a possible reason. I say possible only because they play it as a comparison theory without a final verdict but the presentation is obvious as where they are going.

The video presents scientific evidence of the age of mankind on earth by bio molecular evidence, mankind with dinosaurs on earth at the same time, Walt Brown presents his hydro plate theory (I was delighted having known of it), etc. Make no bones about it they are talking Creationism. Scary stuff for the faithful evolutionists! It's not an in depth treatment but does put out some healthy scientific proof to chew on.

Great video. Great price. For the scoffers who read up to this point if you are really are open minded buy it. It won't break your bank. With a truly scientific mind ponder all the evidence and if so moved crack open that Bible (KJV) collecting dust.  There is other more extensive material out there if you are more fair minded to look into it.

Just remember folks the word ""dinosaur"" was invented in 1841 by Sir Richard Owens but the Bible written before hand refers to them as ""dragons"", ""flying serpents"" and makes two other references with descriptions carrying the names of ""Behemoth"" and ""Leviathan"" (found in Job 40).

Check it out! Add it to your video library. Don't just sit there and scoff. You'll be missing out if you do.",1260921600,3,2898,4.807228915662651
8084437,1,B000BB1NGS,"This disc is sold as a science based program.  It is simply a FRAUD, filled with bible based BS.  It should be labeled as ""creation science,
""intelligent design"" or simply as ""sunday school lesson for sixth graders.",1209513600,6,215,4.783783783783784
8084438,1,B000BB1NGS,"Buyers thinking that this is a lesson in natural history and evolution for their kids need to be aware that this video puts forward alternative theories to evolution, linking events in the geological record to Biblical events.  While the word ""creationist"" is never uttered, some supposedly legitimate theories are proposed alongside well established ones.  Some of these I have never heard of in all of my years of undergraduate, medical, and postgraduate education in the sciences, and yet they are presented as well accepted alternative hypotheses to the extinction of the dinosaur.  I believe the title and packaging are misleading, and there is a lapse in truth in advertising.  Amazon should post a disclaimer, IMHO.",1181347200,11,722,5.252173913043478
8084439,2,B000BB1NGS,"This video has the feel of Discovery Channel but by the end they are making more and more bible references.  This is, to a large extent, an argument that dinosaurs may have been wiped out in ""noah's flood"" and evolution may not be as sturdy science as we may have believed.

It is not bad quality but some of the stuff that appears to be straight science may get logged in your mind with stuff you learn from Discovery Channel and you might start talking in scientific company about discoveries of dino-tracks together with human tracks.  This looks like science but will remind you of hunts for big-foot and proofs of the bible (which this attempts to be).

The greatest value here is showing my son an example of when he should be skeptical of everything he reads and sees.  2 stars instead of 1 due to this unexpected benefit.",1138233600,23,829,4.5
8084440,1,B000BB1NGS,The biggest group of crackpots since time began have all gotten together to have you swallow the most wacko theories in history.  If you seriously believe that mankind walked on earth at the same time as dinosaurs and all of this happened a very short time of just 5000 years ago this is the show for you!  But don't expect to find much of anything about dinosaurs in this DVD.  The cover on this DVD is about the last you will see of them.  But do expect a group of crazed right wing extremists to quote endless verses from the Bible including Genesis and Job as proof that Darwin is wrong.  Continental drift happened very fast according to this movie.  Perhaps it should be renamed continental dash.  This DVD proposes they smashed into each other at 45 mph.  And Noah's flood really did kill off the dinosaurs.  This whole DVD could be best described as right wing political propaganda you buy rather than get for free. I have to say that getting it all was an enormous disappointment for me.  I was expecting to learn something about dinosaurs.  What I got is someone sell me their interpretation of the Bible.  I hope they get their Scope's monkey trial back again.  Maybe then they will get the idea of who the monkeys are?  You would be best to forget owning this.  ... Unless of course you wanna' own mine?,1135987200,32,1315,4.466386554621849
