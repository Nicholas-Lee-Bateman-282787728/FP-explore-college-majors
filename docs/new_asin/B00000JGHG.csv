7912228,5,B00000JGHG,"With Dean Jones in the lead role you can't go wrong. The story chronicles the trial of a mute war hero who is on trial for his life. An ex-attorney (Jones) is asked by his young daughter to defend the mute with a surprise verdict and ending. This show was originally considered for a series but was rejected by the studios because it was too clean (no potential sex or violence story lines). Great story, cinematography and score. For more background on this film, read Dean Jones' autobiography ""Under Running Laughter"" where he devotes 2-3 chapters. Jones took this role due to its clean storyline and his no compromise beliefs concerning his Christian faith and his desire to do family-friendly films. Plenty of cameos in this film.",1088380800,6,735,4.7952755905511815
