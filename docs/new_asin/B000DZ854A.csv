2475243,5,B000DZ854A,"as for the episode ""The Complaint Box"":

Dave: I take the complaint box very seriously and I seem to be the only one who does.

Bill: A complaint about the complaint box? Delicious!

(reading from the complaint box)

Dave: ""You suck."" ""You suck."" ""Howard Stern rules."" ""If you can read this you are a dork."" ""Coupon for one free kiss from Joe if you are a girl."" ""We need more complaint cards."" ""Coupon for one free kiss from Joe if you are a guy.""

Joe: Hey!

Dave: [pulling out a fortune cookie slip] ""You will go on a journey, happy long time."" ""Matthew is a moron."" ""No I'm not."" ""Yes you are."" ""No I'm not infinity."" ""Yes you are infinity plus one."" And this one, ""I have doobie in my funk,"" which I assume is some sort of reference to the Parliament Funkadelic song, ""Chocolate City."" Uh, ""You got peanut butter in my chocolate. You got chocolate in my peanut butter. Together they taste like crap."" ""Matthew has been staring at me all day... and I like it."" I don't think I get this one, it says, ""I try to be good hard-worker-man, but refrigemater so messy, so so messy.""

Lisa: I think that one's probably from Milos, the janitor.

Dave: Oh. Refrigem---oh, then that one's legitimate. [continues reading the complaint cards] Uh, ""Who's the black private dick who's the sex machine with all the chicks.""

All: SHAFT!

Bill: I thought we'd all enjoy that.

Dave: [reading one last card] And, ""Help, I'm being held prisoner in a complaint box,"" which is actually kinda funny.

2475244,5,B000DZ854A,"The first two seasons were great, and I can't wait for the third. The writing is superb, and the characters work very well together. This is probably the best (and most underrated) cast ever assembled for a sitcom. Dave Foley is nominally the star, and does a good job, but Hartman steals the show. Maura Tierney, Stephen Root, etc. are all very talented as well. Andy Dick, who I find very annoying generally, is perfectly cast as Matthew, an equally annoying member of the radio station's staff.

If one sitcom is worth owning on DVD, this is the one.",1136246400,6,553,4.585858585858586

I love this show and now going into the third season you will notice the comedy to really devolop. I can't wait until the release.",1135641600,3,370,4.36231884057971
2475246,5,B000DZ854A,"I can hardly wait for the 3rd season to come out, in fact I can't wait to own the entire series.  Dave Foley is excellent and is still underrated to this day.  Stephen Root, who is gradually getting more and more roles, but not near as many as he should, shines as Jimmy James, the owner of WNYX.  And who could ever forget Phil Hartman as Bill McNeil - maybe his most memorable character ever.

Also, what is quite possibly the great 30-minute sitcom episode of all time will be in this box set.  This episode is the one with Bill and Dave stuck in the St. Louis Airport.  Classic.  You will want to watch it over and over.  The episode where Jimmy James runs for president is another NewsRadio Classic as well.

If you are only going to buy one TV series, or even one DVD, then this is THE one to buy.  In fact, it is a must own.",1135468800,14,831,4.105590062111801

The combination of absurdity, slapstick, and creativity that go into every episode make this the funniest TV show of the 90's, if not of all time.

The show really starts to pick up steam in season 3 (actually, the second half of season 2 as well) and seasons 3 and 4 are the best by far. Thanks Sony, for continuing to release this great show!",1135123200,5,508,4.462365591397849

2475251,5,B000DZ854A,"It's a good time for NewsRadio fans. The release of the first and second seasons in May of 2005 was a dream come true (not associated with Dream Come True Garage Door Openers). As nice as it is to have just the episodes on DVD format, the set included a gag reel, a short featurette and best of all, around 20 commentary tracks from the likes of Paul Simms, Dave Foley, Stephen Root, Maura Tierney, Andy Dick, and the rest of the cast and writers that are still around (Phil Hartman and Drake Sather have both died since the show). Although some fans complained about the video quality (which wasn't great, but was more than acceptable to me), the DVD set was a truly incredible release.

Well, the news has come in, and season 3 is coming out at the end of February (and hopefully that date will not be changed). NewsRadio's third season was when one of, if not the greatest comedy show was at it's prime (which is really the first four seasons, but 3 and 4 are out of the park). I was worried due to the time lapse between DVD releases, which makes it even better news that there will be ten more commentaries, another gag reel, and multiple featurettes (that all sound a bit better than the one included on the first set).

Some of my all time favorite episodes are here...
President - Where Mr. James runs for President and Matthew grow a moustache.

Arcade - Star Gate Defender, SATs and moldy sandwiches.
Daydream - Heat induced hallucinations plague the office.

Movie Star - James Caan visits WNYX and finds out what make Bill McNeil tick.

The Trainer - Dave turns out to be Canadian and the office is shocked. Meanwhile, Bill enrolls at the Ted Chambers gym where he has to deal with the money grubbing antics of Ben Stiller.

Rap - Bill is enraged to find out that Rap music not only has lyrics, but that they are offensive and readily available to the children and the elderly.

Complaint Box - A favorite among anyone who has seen it.

Airport - Dave and Bill are snowed in at an airport in the midwest. One of my all time top five episodes.

The Real Deal - Bill McNeil; Meet Jerry Seinfeld.

Space - What would NewsRadio be like in Outer Space? The answers in this episode.

Every single episode here, all 25, are great. There isn't one that falls below the line of excellence. The ones I listed are just a few personal favorites. The episodes that will have commentary tracks (from everybody again), will be Arcade, Stocks, Daydream, Christmas, The Trainer, Rose Bowl, Our 50th Episode, Sleeping, Mistake and Space. I for one am looking forward to these commentaries almost as much as I am to having the episodes. The other extras include a gag reel (I think), Space: From Table Read to Film, A Visit to Andy's Trailer and Joe Furey's One Man NewsRadio. This promises to be an amazing release.",1135036800,71,2809,4.488235294117647

I just hope I don't have problems years down the road as I absolutely love the show.  I read on Amazon reveiws here that people who bought the complete series were disappointed in the shipping container, so I got them all individually.  Glad I did, but I'm also disappointed in a lack of widescreen options and not much in the way of DVD extras.  Ever heard of bloopers?  Maybe the great Andy Dick didn't make any mistakes.  There are some small features, but not nearly enough considering the gravity of this cast.  Anyway, overall I'm happy.  Glad to have this piece of TV history.

2475294,5,B000DZ854A,"I gave the DVD set for seasons 1 and 2 five stars, saying it was a very good, but not great sit-com, unlike some of the very best, such as ""All in the Family"", ""Taxi"", and ""Cheers"". I continue to give the show five stars, because it is very entertaining, and that's what is important. This season seems better than Seasons 1 and 2 because the ""geometry"" of the relations between the eight principle cast members has settled in, and begins to make the episodes make more sense. In the foreground is the pairing of Dave (Dave Foley) and Lisa (Maura Tierney), which seems 'on again', but not a major topic in this season's stories. Primary colors are added by the two heavy weight comic contributors, Jimmy James (Stephen Root) and Bill (Phil Hartman). Both are ""loose cannons"" outside News Director Dave's control, but for two very different reasons. Matthew (Andy Dick) and Beth (Vicki Lewis) are there to be either victims of Bill's disdain or annoyances to Dave and Lisa. Joe (Joe Rogan) and Catherine (Khandi Alexander)almost seem to be surrogates for how the audience reacts to Bill and Jimmy and Matthew and Beth. They are rarely the center of an episode's story, but they are often the key which opens or closes an episode, and generally provide some sanity in the face of the more ""off the wall"" characters.

The show may be compared to a very good, but not great dessert. You look forward to it, but in the end, it seems like empty calories. I have yet to see an episide where I really felt any concern for any of the characters. There is none of the intensity and fire between Dave and Lisa that we see between Sam Malone and Diane Chambers on ""Cheers"". There is no genuinely obnoxious badgering we see from Louie in ""Taxi"", where you keep wishing Alex Rieger would pop him on the chin. There is certainly none of the pathos we get from the best episodes of ""M*A*S*H"" and ""All in the Family"". One wonders, then, why is it not as good as ""Seinfeld"". I'm not sure I have a good answer, except that the ""Seinfeld"" characters seem far more like real people. When Matthew screws up, it's because he's a spaz, virtually a comic book character. When George Costanza screws up, I tend to both feel sorry for him and wish that he were really not that shallow and dumb. But then, the shallowness of the characters is the whole point of a show which is about ""nothing"".

These DVDs have comment tracks on a few episodes, and as others have pointed out, they are virtually worthless. They seem to be conversations between various writers and cast, which happen to go on while an episode is playing in the background. This actually contributes to my sense that there is really nothing much of value you can say about these people or their stories.",1344816000,,2742,4.548582995951417
2475295,5,B000DZ854A,"this is such a great show, i miss watching it and am glad to have this in my collection. i highly recommend getting this show.",1340323200,,126,4.08
2475296,5,B000DZ854A,"If you quizzed most average TV viewers on their favorite sitcoms I doubt many would include ""NewsRadio"". However, I have no doubt that some time in 2045 there will be an academic seminar titled 'NewRadio: A 50th Anniversary Retrospective"" with session titles like ""Matthew's Manic Moves: A Study of Physical Comedy and Andy Dick"" or ""Phil Hartman-Comedic Genius Taken before his Time"". Not given much network support or attention during it's intial run, 'NewsRadio"" is a hidden gem, the toy prize in a box of video Cracker Jacks.

The show has several things going for it:

1. It has a good sized ensemble of well-developed dynamic characters that all interact together well. These are all archtypes that we have encountered in our lives and they are all written/tailored for the time period involved. The effect is much like when your folks laughing at WKRP in Cinncinnti and saying ""It's so funny because it's true.""

2. There are just the right number of in-jokes. Weaving pop-culture elements into the script help establish a connection between a show's world and ours. - these could be the people working in the office on the next floor. At the same time the connections are  not overdone to the point of making the show another ""Talk Soup""

3. There is slight sense of surrealism. Events and reality are regularly tweaked and warped in what I call the ""Monty Python effect' to maximise effect. The surrealism is not nearly as pronounced as it was with the Pythons or Ernie Kovacs but there are enough surprises to add to the overall effect. Because it is a 90s show also has a slightly slower pacing so you have a better chance of catching and savoring most of the many facets of complex humor.

4. The show ended before it got old. Some people might debate that they should have just not come back after Phil Hartman was killed in 97 but I think they needed to cap things off. I don't think anyone could have ""replaced"" Phil but at the same time no one could have soldiered on in his place better than Jon Lovitz. If we could have kept ""Bill McNeil"" I have no doubt there'd be 'NewRadio"" episodes floating around reflecting the events of 9/11.

I started picking up the DVDs via Amazon in 2008. I thought I would remember one or two episodes from first-time network broadcast but was surprised to find that I had seen at least 3/4 of them.

As for availability I don't know if NewsRadio is currently being shown any where on cable but the DVDS are very affordable . They are also available for download via Amazon Instant Video as well, so I am loading up my MP3 player with episodes.

Actually I like this show BETTER, and I'm a sitcom fan. Comedy is the hardest thing there is because it either works or not.

The episode ""Movie Star"" with James Caan is one of the single funniest episodes I've ever seen - especially if you are a fan of Green Acres bizarre surreal style. I was coughing laughing.

Writing - probably the best and smartest of any sitcom, most surreal too. Very surreal. VERY intelligent. Even the titles are funny, for no particular reason - if you are a fan of rock music.

Directing - Sharp and snappy - you can almost feel the intelligence on the set - wonderful editing and graphics

Actors - one of the best and most under rated group ever, particularly Stephen Root, who is virtually unknown but a very VERY funny guy. These people must have had a very hard time not busting up constantly. Maura Tierney shows how good she can be when not wasted in a stupid show. Joe Grogan, smart guy too, though you might not know it from his other exposures on TV, very tough and funny stand up comic. Even if you don't like Andy Dick you'll like him here.

2475300,4,B000DZ854A,"Well, I'm watching this season on DVD and, yes, while we all know that the episodes are immensely pleasing, I have to scold the production team for their commentaries.  It could have been great if they had taken the slightest effort to even watch the episodes they were intending to comment on before appearing in the recording studio.  At least know the plot, and better yet - plan ahead with a few scintillating technical details and stories from the set.  Instead the commenters were reaching back ten years or so to try to remember ANYTHING to say about the episodes.  If I may paraphrase the commentaries - ""Does anyone know what's going on here?  Totally incorrect assessment of the plot line on screen.  Well, I guess we've run out of things to say.  We suck.  Hahahaha!""  Several times they'd point out a guest actor and say ""Oh, that guy!  What's his name?  He went on to do something, what was it?  Does anyone remember his name?""  The one exception was Rose Bowl, in which the writers yakked endlessly (I fast forwarded through most of it after a while) about George ""Goober"" Lindsey, who appears for 20 seconds towards the end of the episode in an appearance that was painfully padded to attempt to make it worth the effort.  The other 25 minutes of the episode was forgotten to them.

As one reviewer mentioned earlier in his complaints about the shoddy commentary - Maura Tierney had to be telephoned for commentary because she had a work conflict.  However, even though she couldn't see the show, it turned out that she's the only one who's see the shows in the past ten years and was actually able to make some of the most interesting and relevant commentary from the set of ER.

If you're a Newsradio fan, you'll want to have it for the episodes.  But I must detract a star because the production team totally flaked out on their fans and posterity, sort of devaluing (through apparent neglect and disrespect) their show that their fans love.",1221350400,,1959,4.628985507246377

It's the same wacky ""at work"" sense of humor that ""Scrubs"" and ""The Office"" have. If you like one, you'll like the other. Each member of the cast is a perfect choice for their roles. The 3 standouts, in my opinion, are Phil Hartman as the ego-centric newsman Bill McNiel, Andy Dick as the goofball mega-nerd Matthew Brock, and Stephen Root as the quirky billionaire Jimmy James.

Everytime I watch an episode, I always think what a great comedian Phil Hartman was. He's a true comedic master. These DVD are a great testament to that.

2475325,4,B000DZ854A,"Not as memorable as Seasons 1& 2, but still beats the [...] being electron-gunned at my non-HD TV (that's HD for hellacious dramatizers).  Very much anticipating Season 4, for four months I've been doing so.  Dave Foley really impressed me yet again with his lightening quick witticisms, but there are other elements of the writing that almost became forecastable and lackluster.  After watching 2 opening seasons of miminy-piminy jiminy....glickin' crickets this is laughable material, Season 3 suffers a comedic tapering-off effect explainable perhaps by frustration with the ratings the show was then getting network-slapped by.  In many scenes the situational build up is evident, and the punchline is emptied of what draws a chuckle.

Take away Lisa Kudrow from friends and give her a role in NewsRadio and everybody's favorite supine stare-fest may have instead been the AM-propaganda panda.  Not to discredit Vicki Lewis, Khandi Alexander (wedded Jason?), and Maura Tierrney (can't immediately spell Tipperary either), they all play their parts to perfection.  It could be said this season lacked the aggressiveness of the first two, and Andy Dick seems stifled writing-wise in a few shows too many.

Can't blame the cast, because the confluence of interplay is still there, however, something certainly is missing or went awry, productionally speaking.  All in all I still love the DVD but only a minute portion of the episodes met my expectations.  Four Stars for the 'Complaint Box' & the one where Phil/Bill (Monica reads it dyslexically) gets institutionalized.

Trickster Dickster's still got it, readily apparent in Phil Simm's visit to Andy's tractor-(need something to transport that much inhalant)-trailer for a rare glimpse of revved and roaring Tricky Dicky at play.  Seriously now, the guy had a pipe-full of smurf-pudding jam packed into his couch cushions, and he's off-the-hook giving the run down of his melodious composition.  Andy's natural gifts here are on full display; he, Robin Williams, and Jim Carey are three of the fastest & funniest idea shufflers this side of Mars metric system converts (watch Robin Williams Live on Broadway).  I could rave about Andy Dick's insanely gut-wrenching style until Star Jones put(s) the heft back on... but I do not savor nor can I stomach counting her daily dose of chip-bag polyunsaturateds (that is when she used to consume nutrients).  There's a reality show destined to attract a lot of obesely disorienteds; Anna Nicole squares off against skeletal emulator herself Star Jones for who can cram the most trimspas in one sitting while listing the greatest number of candy bars conjurable - consider hiring Ozzie to fill in as Anna Nicole's voice over, nuts in a vice.

I fell in love with it because of Khandi Alexander; her sassy sister remarks and fine comedic acting was the clencher for me to continue watching.  The fact that even the producers and directors admitted that she was underused was a further incentive for watching, incase they opted to give her some more meaningful dialogue, which meant she would do more than just be added as ""also starring....

I enjoyed Dave from the ""Boys in the Hall"" series and Joe from his stand up comedy.  The other cast members are honorable in their own right.

The only gripe I have with this show was with the previous reviews including the ones on the commentaries; yelping on and about the Lisa character, yeah she was cute in a non developed frontal way.  I enjoyed the Vicki Lewis and Khandi Alexander very much for their sardonic humour excellent timing and fabulous good looks. Phil Hartman without saying was gorgeously talented and I loved his face offs with the Lisa and Catherine characters.  Also I wish they had continued the Ton Luc character along with Junior.

Three scenes I thoroughly enjoyed which featured Khandi Alexander prominently were: (1)When she taught Bill ebonics for the beer commercial (2)When she was leaving and everyone had their take on that day, and when (3)she daydreamed how the office would be if it were really diversified.",1144281600,,1422,4.823045267489712
