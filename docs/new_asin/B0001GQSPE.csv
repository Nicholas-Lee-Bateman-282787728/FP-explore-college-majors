8012361,4,B0001GQSPE,"Made in 1969 for the price of a second hand bike (more or less) this film is all about being young and having nowt. Del is working in a factory when he meets the teenage Anne and his hormones take over and he just wants to be with her. He does have a motor bike though and can afford the odd bag of chips. He also has some mates and one of these is Bronco Bullfrog.

Bronco is a bit of a legend as he has been in borstal and has returned to his old haunts and habits because he has nowhere else to go. This is a kitchen sink drama - without the sink. It was made by Barney Platts - Mills with a cast of non actors in order to keep the costs down. What he has come up with is a great little film and a rather nice time capsule on the sixties just where we were going to tip into the optimistic seventies and the fashions certainly reflect that.

He has loads of little things here that were ordinary then, but have been lost to the mists of time - like getting one person into the cinema then they let everyone else in through the fire exit - brilliant. This is not a great film of itself it but there is so much here to admire and appreciate that it becomes the sum of its parts and is a rewarding watch for it. A testament to a lost Britain.",1432771200,,1242,3.9051383399209487
8012362,3,B0001GQSPE,"This movie can get a bit boring.  The sound's often bad too.  If it weren't for the fact that it the film belongs to skins and suedeheads it would most likley have been forgotten by most years ago.

While it may not be that great a film, it is an interesting document of a time period.  I own it and watched it a couple times.  No regrets.  But it really isn't a ""great"" film, even if the sound were improved upon.",1203811200,,414,4.049382716049383
8012363,3,B0001GQSPE,"Kitchen-sink theatre was well into (and possibly even past) its prime before films portraying what reviewers called ""a gritty realism"" started to appear.  On the whole, the most successful kitchen-sink films - directors realized the versatility of the medium at once, and they effectively became agitprop films - were the ones based on recent novels of working-class life.  ""The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner"", ""This Sporting Life"", ""Kes"" (badly over-rated), and ""Poor Cow"" were the acknowledged classics.

I mention ""Poor Cow"" last because Nell Dunn, like Barney Platts-Mills who directed ""Bronco Bullfrog"", was labelled as a rich kid slumming.  Sincerity needn't come through, or be belied, on screen; you care first about things like plot, characters and setting, and little else really matters.

Looking at ""Bronco Bullfrog"", the plot is a simple one.  We're at the tail end of the nineteen-sixties here, the period of the suedeheads, and before massive immigration, before anything much had been done to give the lower reaches of the working class a real chance at post-war prosperity.  If you think of Stratford East and districts like it all over England, and it strikes you that Del is apprenticed to a skilled trade, you reflect that he's better off than most, although he may not know it.  Boredom, anomie, the gradual movement into crime: the tempo of the film alone says what needs to be said about ""Bronco Bullfrog"".  All ordinary things except, possibly, the way Jo projects his fun in stealing - and the fears that come with it.

The characters were based on the reach of the young people at Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop in Stratford - in fact, Platts-Mills did most of his casting there.  He chose well; Anne Gooding, the one lead who had nothing to do with Stratford East, was spotted by Platts-Mills working in Hammersmith and just looked right.  ""Everybody is an actor,"" was Joan Littlewood's motto, and this young cast all in essence plays itself.  A lot of improvisation went into ""Bronco Bullfrog"", and it fits, even if much of the screenplay was pretty non-verbal.

The setting - well, Stratford East plays Stratford East, and you can see exactly how grim it must have been to grow up and attach your hopes to such places.  I thought it good that, when Del and Irene escape to rural Essex, they see nothing better than East London rather than a refuge where the streets are paved with gold.  I know the decision to film in black-and-white was for budgetary reasons - but you can't help suspecting that Platts-Mills also wanted it for political realism (that's a pretty black-and-white vision that you get if you happen to live in Stratford).  Doing it in colour might have been less depressing but a whole lot more alive.  And agitprop, to work, HAS TO come alive; whereas, unfortunately, ""Bronco Bullfrog"" often turns into trite propaganda.

Oh, yes.  Why it's temporarily unavailable.  Things change quickly, but, for the moment, it's only available directly from Barney Platts-Mills' Web site - [...].  This may be modified, because it's unusual for a little film to maintain such popularity for so long, and it's good to be able to find it on Amazon's site, but for the moment it's for direct purchase only.",1195776000,,3249,4.94475138121547
8012364,5,B0001GQSPE,"I saw this film ten years ago at an underground film festival in London and have been trying to get a copy ever since.  This film stars Sam Shepard at about 16 years of age. It is dogma 30 years before dogma was invented. If you are a Mike Leigh fan you must see this. Groundbreaking--it was more like watching real life than any narrative film I have ever seen. The film supposedly also influenced Pete Townshend of The Who, and inspired another rock band to take its title. I however ordered this film last year and it did not play in my NTSC DVD player so I sent it back. Can't wait until the foolproof non-PAL dvd is released.",1124064000,,630,4.25
8012365,5,B0001GQSPE,"This fairly unknown British film is really a classic of the genre. Very realistic portrayal of disenchanted working class youth in London.

Del is a bored youth going nowhere and doing nothing, with a dead end job, in a dead end town (starting to sound like a KINKS song) who basically runs around with his Suedehead/Skinhead friends, committing little thefts, trying to act hard and the like and generally looking for something to do.

He has two meetings that will change his life. 1) Jo ""Bronco Bullfrog"" has just escaped from the Borstal and is on the run, ""doing jobs"" (petty crime) and avoiding the law. 2) Irene, his teenage love interest. Del's relationship with both will test his limits and see how far he is really willing to go.

We take a look at one's kid's futile attempts to become soemthing bigger and escape the doldrums that life has to offer.

Using actual London youth as actors, the movies hits upon a gritty realism and is almost ""kitchen sink-ish"". Bronco Bullfrog influenced filmmakes and musicians for years to come. Quadrophenia, BLUR, The ORDINARY BOYS, all owe a debt to this over looked classic.

Footnote: although this claims to be Region 1 disc, it is also in PAL format, which means it did not play in my SONY DVD player. Luckily it played on my computer DVD-ROM and I bought a $70 Philips DVD player that played ALL REGIONS. This DVD will not play in most *regular* players.",1099008000,5,1409,4.665322580645161
