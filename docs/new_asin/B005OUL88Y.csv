4854844,3,B005OUL88Y,"The movie is a sci-fi horror mystery. I had some flashbacks to ""Twin Peaks."" The town has sink holes, disappearances, a corporation that seems to be causing cancers, a mental facility, and Joseph Webber (Reggie Bannister) a recently paroled pedophile deliberately placed back in his old neighborhood where he is harassed. As the town is torn apart by strange events, a group of people attempt to figure out what is going on.

The movie starts out slow and climaxes early in aisle 11-2. What we need was more of the weirdness in aisle 11-2 to have saved this film. It suffers from the lack of good dialouge creating memorable characters. The mystery is revealed about half way through the film...or sooner if you read the title. The film had some real potential but was hampered by budget constraints and mediocre writing. There were a few rare dark comedy moments in a movie that should of had more.

4854845,1,B005OUL88Y,"I am here to agree with another reviewer, I have rarely reviewed movies, but I almost feel like it is my duty as a viewer to express how incredibly awful this movie was. I came into it with an open mind, and I love a good psychological thriller/horror film.  Not only was the acting terrible, and the special effects cheesier than a 1970s low budget film, but the movie did not make sense, and was incredibly hard to follow. For example, a scene reflects back where the main character is remembering being in high school, but its hard to figure out that this is what is going on, because the characters all look over 35. Another scene, the main characters mother comes in, but the acting is so off, you think it is an ex lover, then about 2 minutes later, you realize that the thinking was totally wrong.

I am all about supporting indie films, something unique, out of the ordinary. But this was just bad. BAD, bad. Imagine the things that make awful movies awful, and this movie has all of it. I seriously wonder if this is some kind of experiment by LIONS GATE to see if anyone notices. I am truly in shock. Watch this movie for a laugh, and a disturbing one at that.",1326412800,8,1170,4.337899543378995
4854846,1,B005OUL88Y,"I usually do not take the time or trouble to write reviews; however, I am making an exception because i feel a sense of duty to warn anyone who may be considering buying this DVD to PLEASE, please do not waste your money. This is one of the worst movies ever made. The plot is indecipherable; the acting is deplorable; and, the special effects and CGI are cheap, hokey, and laughable. I actually was riveted throughout the entire 90 min. because I couldn't believe how bad it was. And the more I watched, the more I shook my head in disgusted disbelief. There is a protracted scene featuring demonic dolls that is so cheap and creepy, I didn't know whether to laugh or gag. Seriously, the only recommendation I would give this movie is that it is almost worth purchasing just to see how exceedingly execrable it actually is.",1323648000,18,824,4.5369127516778525
4854847,4,B005OUL88Y,"Was anxious to watch Psychic Experiment so I decided to rent it on a quiet Sunday night. I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. There were several scenes in Psychic Experiment that caught my eye that I will not mention-don't want to give out any spoilers. It was one of the most original scfi movies that I have ever scene. This movie has really incredible special effects that will not disappoint. It was really great to see Adrienne King back in a movie again!!! Also wonderful performances from Debbie Rochon, Reggie Banister and well everyone in the film!!! Please check out Mel House's very impressive film!!!",1323475200,2,619,4.794392523364486

4854849,1,B005OUL88Y,"How Katie Featherstone decided to attach herself to this project is beyond me. The only reason I rented it, in fact, was because she was in it, and I expected something at least as professionally made as the Paranormal Activity trilogy. This one sinks far below that to the barely watchable. Katie is barely in this (which is probably good for her future hopes to work in better films). The plot, acting, setting, photography, etc., are all beyond amateurish. This film struck me more as something a stoned, untalented community college film student would throw together as his final thesis film. It's really just...terrible. Save your money for something - anything - but this.",1323043200,,678,4.956140350877193

4854851,2,B005OUL88Y,"""We got word that something big was supposed to happen this week. We know that there is a skeleton crew here but everyone else is off site. I'm beginning to understand why."" A small town that is home to a psych hospital is having a problem. The citizens are disappearing and dying gruesome deaths. A reporter is sent to investigate the mystery. To say this movie is bazaar is an understatement. To talk about this at all is going to lead to me giving something away. The only thing that I can say is that the acting and effects are not that impressive, and neither is the movie really, but it kept me watching. I have seen worse, but in the recent string of psych hospital movies this one is toward the bottom. If you are big into horror then you may like this, I though ""The Ward"" was better. Overall, I'm not sure if the acting and effects had an impact on how I felt, but I wasn't impressed by this. I give it a C-.",1322784000,6,918,4.192090395480226

8481993,4,B005OUL88Y,I thought that this film was really good because most psychic films you don't know what is happening. Also most psychic films you can't follow it because there's no storyline to follow. Psychic experiment is a very good movie which I think will have most people on the edge of their seats. It is scary but also very gory in certain areas of the film. The plot of the story is simple yet easy to see what's going on.,1389225600,,415,4.265822784810126

8481995,1,B005OUL88Y,"Originally filmed in 2008 as Walking Distance and finally being released by Lionsgate as Psychic Experiment. Low budget sci-fi/horror stars horror vets Adrienne King and Reggie Bannister with a brief 2 scene appearance by Paranormal Activity star Katie Featherston. Filmed a year before Paranormal Activity became a sequel spawning hit, Lionsgate is taking full advantage of Miss Featherston's star power By featuring her prominently on the movie poster and in the billing despite having less then 5 minutes of screen time. Flick centers on a man returning to his small hometown and finding himself in the middle of the title event. Experiments are being conducted using psychically gifted people to effect changes in reality, or something like that, in the over-complicated and conviluted plot. Pic is slow moving despite Lionsgate asking director Mel House to remove 20 minutes of footage and bites off far more then it's meager budget can chew. The gore effects are OK but, the CGI is real cheesy and over-used as filmmaker House tries to accomplish things far too ambitious to be successfully carried out on his low budget. The plot is hard to follow, too many ideas crammed into one movie. I appreciate someone trying to do something original but, this film would have benefitted from being on a smaller scale and with a more streamlined focus, something the budget and audience can handle. What we get is basically a mess that leaves us scratching our heads more then involving us as we are bludgeoned with endless CGI and gore FX wrapped around all the idea overload. The acting doesn't help either, but, the characters are thinly written and there are too many of them. Half of the characters could have been omitted without effecting the film whatsoever. This is a sterling example of ambition overcoming common sense. House had to look no further then cast member Miss Featherston's ""other"" movies to see that sometimes less is more.",1362268800,,1943,5.018575851393189

8481997,1,B005OUL88Y,"This movie is really a mess.  It seems like the screenplay was thrown together haphazardly with no sense of logic or cohesion.
From the film's title, it's easy to ascertain what's supposed to be happening, but the script doesn't really offer any reason for the ""experiment"" nor the various characters' role in said experiment.
The special effects are cartoonish and laughable and the acting subpar.  Glenn Morshower (24), Katie Featherston (Paranormal Activity franchise) and Adrienne King (the original Friday the 13th) collect their paychecks and the rest of the cast are community theatre level.
I find nothing to recommend this stinker.",1329436800,,640,5.326732673267327
