8034385,5,B0002Y0HXY,Got this for my grandson who is Asperger's and is totally fascinated with Humpback Whales. He LOVED it to say the least. I would reccommend this movie to all!!,1320192000,,159,4.517241379310345
8034386,5,B0002Y0HXY,"This is an informative and interesting narrative on the humpback whale.  By the end of it one feels he is actually ac
quainted with the whale!",1272672000,,142,4.461538461538462
8034387,5,B0002Y0HXY,Kids under 6 aren't really into the National geographic version of Whales and no kid wants to watch the horrific and unfortunate things that are happening to whales. This is a wonderful way to introduce whales to younger children and my nephew just loved it. Its so nice that they have followed these whales and they even follow them as a whale family. They have other videos about this whale salt and Friends they are all good.,1265500800,,428,4.571428571428571
8034388,5,B0002Y0HXY,"My 2 year-old loved the whale scenes from ""Finding Nemo"" and this was the next best extension for that passion. ""Salt & Friends"" helps kids to identify with whales on a personal level: who they are, how many babies they have, thier sense of humor, just the thing to enthrall young children who love whales. After months of ""breaching and splashing"" all around the house, my now 3 year-old has convinced us to take him whale watching in Gloucester, MA where the footage was originally shot. Exciting and fast-paced for adults, no. But if your child loves whales then this amazing whale footage might just be the thing to push them over the edge and make the next Jacques Cousteau out of them.",1153785600,,691,4.626016260162602
8034389,5,B0002Y0HXY,My kids love this.  They have picked favorites among the whale families and watch those sections over and over.  I'm also surprised by the number of things they learned and remember about humpback whales.  They are starting to search websites about whales thanks to this DVD.,1107993600,2,275,4.934782608695652
8034390,4,B0002Y0HXY,"This is so unusual.  It shows whales almost like they were pets, but they are wild and too big to ever put in an aquarium.

Some liked people and seemed to be showing off!  There were even several whales who have many calfs and some grandcalves.

This is unique and great for all ages.",1101254400,2,285,4.222222222222222
8034391,5,B0002Y0HXY,"This program is fantastic!  My kids watch it several times each week.  They have adopted a whale that they met on the DVD.

It is entertaining for the kids but they are learning a lot about whales and having fun at the same time.  Highly recommended.",1101168000,4,250,4.369565217391305
