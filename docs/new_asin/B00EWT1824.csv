5948970,1,B00EWT1824,"Sorry, but I can't get past the horror of seeing white children come onto the stage in blackface caricature, looking like golliwoggs. And ballerinas in brown leotards (suggesting they're naked except for a few gold strings around their waist), with afro wigs and blackface. And why was it necessary to cover Hui He with brown, uneven make-up (looking more like dirt or ash) that starts to run when she sweats and cries? Or Ambrogio Maestri for that matter? We don't have enough imagination to picture them as Ethiopian without it? If we can imagine old, fat and ugly singers as beautiful and young, I think we can make the leap with race. Disgusting is the only word I have for this. I'm sorry I listened to the other reviewers and purchased this. I'm ashamed to own it.",1390521600,5,770,4.627737226277373
5948971,4,B00EWT1824,"This production was very good; I haven't seen much opera but it held my interest.  I recommend watching the 3-D version if you have the equipment, as it added a lot and made it seem like I had a front row seat.",1389225600,3,210,4.0
5948972,5,B00EWT1824,"this production of aida is what the term grand opera is all about.  of course there are minor issues, but one can say that with just about any dvd production.  I don't think anyone can find a more spine tingling triumphal scene anywhere.  i have several dvds of aida but i always keep coming back to this production for its sheer enveloping size.  almost overwhelming!!!  not to be equaled for some time.  the visual and sound aspects are superb!  a wonderful addition to my collection.",1388707200,2,486,4.647058823529412
5948973,4,B00EWT1824,"Okay, this is a reprised production of the grand 1913 La Scala premiere, the sets of which were designed and made with the involvement of Auguste Mariette, the eminent French Egyptologist at the instigation of the Khedive (Viceroy) at that time. The Khedive stipulated that the opera that was to be premiered was to be a purely ancient Egypt with the sets to be based on historical accounts and costumes to be designed after the archaological bas reliefs of upper Egypt. Mariette knew what the Khedive wanted and said No effort will be spared in this respect, and the mise-en-scne will be as splendid as one can imagine. You know the viceroy does things in a grand style.
Imagine, what joy it is to be able to watch a re-creation of that splendid premiere version, especially for Asian viewers who had not been able to see the great inauguration production, nor given any idea of what that looked like!
Apart from the vocal side, this production has great choregraphy and great dancing.  The venue, the Arena di Verona, has an even larger size than La Scala in which this production premiered, with a grand scale and magnificent acoustics of the Roman arena that is even more ideally suited to the pageantry of Verdi's Egyptian opera, framed by obelisks and sphinxes and filled with chorus and dancers.
Filmed in the 2000 year-old Roman amphitheatre at Verona with 20,000 seats and in 3D & High Definition in 2012.
Gianfranco De Bosio directing the revival of the original 1913 production, and he, together with conductor Daniel Oren, approach the production at a 'grand' manner.
Luckily, in the title role, sung by Hui He, she is able to provide the dire subtlty and musical nuances of the work in the portrayal of the eponymous slave girl.
Both her big arias, Ritorna vincitor and O patria Mia gleam. As her competitor for Radams love, the experienced Hungarian mezzo-soprano Andrea Ulbrich has a voice is big enough for the role and although not particularly subtle in characterisation.  However, she has the vocal heft and bite to come over in the large Verona Arena while her acting is committed.
As the war hero  Radams, Italian tenor Marco Bertie retains his usual good standard as a true Verdian tenor, though imperfect in his acting, but strangely works well enough for the large space at Verona.
The real vocal king in this production is  Ambrogio Maestri, who looks as if he could stomp the Egyptians to death if he wanted to, who sings and acts a monumental Amonasro.",1388534400,9,2479,4.771561771561772
5948974,4,B00EWT1824,"Aida is a hell of an opera to stage: Enormous sets?? massive sound stage? huge cast, expensive costumes and it needs a decent set of soloists. Recent Blu-ray releases have been lamentable so this new release faces little competition. That is not to deride it before I start but I found it a bit of a mixed bag. It is an attempt to recreate the original staging in 1913 under Tullio Serafin and it would appear to achieve this remarkably well. The only other mega stage Aida is the SD release from St Margarethen and I have compared them in part. St Margarethen is even bigger than Verona and obviously suffers from massive sound issues from the head mics and the huge distances but it is still quite impressive.
 Here the sound is better managed with a battery of fixed mics along the front of the stage and no head mics were visible if they were used at all. It worked quite well and one could not expect much better considering the nature of the arena. The staging was spectacular with an enormous cast of dancers and soldiers, even dancing horses that bowed and a cat that failed to turn up at the end for his bow! The camera work was good with one regret: There were no close ups of any of the dancers, many of whom were beautifully turned out and put on a rip-roaring show. They deserved more exposure and as the audience I wanted it too. Many were Africans as far as I could see, including children, and they were given no credits which is a shame. The costumes and general staging were magnificent and although the bit rate was a bit low (18-20 Mbps) it all looked very good. The soloists were adequate but not in my view anything to really shout about. The Met soloists were grossly overweight and this is a bit of an issue here. As cameras on Blu-ray recordings get better the appearance of the soloists DOES matter and age and fitness do influence the audience's perception. I remember Marco Berti as an indifferent Calaf in Turandot in the Forbidden City and he has not added much lustre in my view. Neither of the ladies were particularly well cast but sang quite well.
 I do not like 3D and have not tested this disc under 3D conditions. All in all this must be the best Aida on disc right now and we may never get a more spectacular setting but there is certainly room for improvement in the soloists. The Israeli conductor did a great job and the orchestra played beautifully.
I would like to add a correction having watched this again, the "" African"" dancers are not original Africans but look like it because they are all dressed up in afro wigs and black skin suits!! The white lines round the neck give the game away! Perhaps the cat should have had an afro coat as well!!",1386806400,2,2691,4.4124748490945676
5948975,5,B00EWT1824,"There are two general approaches to Aida, gentle reader: the first focuses on the spectacle of ancient Egypt; the second on the relationships between the principal characters. The former is represented on DVD by the Met version with Botha and Urmana; the latter by the long deleted (but soon to be re-issued) version from the Teatro Giuseppi Verdi's tiny (30m) stage in Busetto. This release, from the Arena di Verona, does both and does so to near perfection.

The sets date back to 1913, and have to be seen to be believed. There are few venues for opera that would allow for the enormous scope and complexity of the sets and I cannot remember ever seeing anything to rival them.

The singers are ,in the main, excelllent.

I was totally gobsmacked by Hui He as Aida. I am still unsure as to which superlatives would encompass the totality of what we experienced. My reference of Aida has always been Leontyne Price, but if He didn't eclipse her, she came VERY close. The voice is simply splendid from top to bottom. She floats those incredible pianissimi with no apparent effort and when it's time for forte singing she just opens up and rattles the rafters. There is a lot of singing for He in Aida, but there was no sign of fatigue or strain. Dramatically, too, she is spot on. I pray to the opera gods to get more on disc of this incredible lady!

Andrea Ulbrich is almost as good as Amneris. She has a rich, deep mezzo voice with splendid technique, but she sounded a bit tired and strained right at the end of Act IV when she had to nail a high note forte. Otherwise a credible job, dramatically and musically.

I think that Ambrogio Maestri is the best Amonasro I have heard other than Leonard Warren. Superb voice! Superb technique! Great stage presence, even if he is a bit large.

Marco Berti is not the best Rhadames in memory. He is not effective in Celeste Aida. I know that it's a killer piece to sing right at the start of the opera, and I know that only Tucker and Corelli (in my experience) have done it perfectly, but perhaps a bit more warming up might have made the aria go better. Considering the dearth of modern Verdi singers in general and tenors in particular, I really can't be overly critical.

The rest of the cast does a great job, and Daniel Oren nails it from the pit! Cosidering the size of the Arena, the orchestral detailing is quite good. Picture and sound are splendid, especailly in the DTS mode.

The performance is complete on one disc with no extra features.

The sum of this superlative Aida is the result of all the parts meshing extremely well and I cannot recall a better performance (certainly none on disc) im my lifetime.

Buy this one with confidence",1385510400,19,2700,4.514344262295082

8610130,3,B00EWT1824,"Fantastic 3D spectacle!  Unfortunately, the audio is damaged throughout by relying on foot mics too closely placed to orchestra, capturing some idiot sighing all through the opera just as loud as the singers.  Also all kinds of other accidental sounds are captured.  Very distracting.  Somewhere in Act II I finally got to the point where I could listen around it and enjoy it anyway.  If the audio recording had been as good as the video this would be one of the best opera blu-rays ever.  Still, it's a must-see just for the video. MORE 3D PLEASE!",1475884800,,549,4.666666666666667
8610131,2,B00EWT1824,"This is a pretty spectacular show with regard to the lavish production. However, the actual performance was fairly lackluster. Marco Berti is about as wooden portayal as I have seen, and certainly does not look the part. His characterization and physical dimensions remind me of Pavarotti. However, Pavarotti had unparalleled vocal technique and beauty of voice that Berti simply can not equal. The singing and acting by the other leads is variable in quality, uneven from aria to aria. There are some sync issues between singer and orchestra, but that is understandable given the venue and acoustics where this was filmed. I'm glad I borrowed this from the nearby university library before doing a 'blind' buy. I won't be adding this one to my collection, despite the 3d aspect which is pretty cool on a 3d tv. And yes, a stray cat does video bomb the taping early in the first act. Trivial, but amusing.",1471996800,,905,4.84516129032258

8610135,4,B00EWT1824,"I do like this DVD, the sets, the ballet, especially He's singing and acting (very good acting indeed) as Aida.  However, there's a better version of Aida also sung by He and performed at Arena di Verona, which is too available at Amazon (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J587L6E/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1).  Why do I like the other DVD better?

1, the leading tenor is much much better, so is the princess- mezzo soprano.  You would know the difference once you hear Radames' aria ""Celeste Aida"" at the beginning.

2, the music and conducting.  This DVD is good, but the other is WOW!

3, the sets. This one is beautiful and traditional, but the other is so inspiring, creative, imaginative, full of surprises while yet very very beautiful.

4, the acting.  The other one is more vivid and touching.

5, Believe me, I really really love He's Aida in this DVD, but she was even better in the other DVD!

In short, buy the other Aida. In my opinion it is the best Aida available on DVD.

8610136,3,B00EWT1824,"With the exception of a fine Aida this cast is pedestrian at best and abysmal at worst. Amneris is chubby's love interest or his mother? The Pharaoh gave birth to her when he was, what? ... minus twenty?
There are plenty of talents who suit roles physically. Not in this production. Sorry, but I've had it with greased down hair Rodolphos, physically misfit Radams and just about every other physically inappropriate casting choice. I'm sure these characters were believable from the cheap seats. On a Blu ray disc.......not a chance. Too distracting.
Mic balance in the orchestra was often way off; often ignoring the melody line.",1401408000,,631,4.962264150943396
8610137,4,B00EWT1824,Of course this opera is a spectacle  with only the good music in the second act  but the massive number of actors and singers wwas quite mind boggling..I know this is trivial but did people notice the white cat that strayed on stage casually walked up the steps and then came down again..all in the first scene.,1395360000,2,311,4.43859649122807
8610138,3,B00EWT1824,"I bought this DVD together with Hui He's CD.  I usually don't write negative review, but since my first intention was to do it, I will say only a few words.
  I don't understand why people buy tickets to a show that they can't see anything even with a giant TV screen.  And I believe I saw a big dog running wild at the back of the stage while the show is in progress, I wonder whether it was part of the plot; I really doubt it.
  In short, this is not my type.  I gave it a three-star because although I don't like it, it nevertheless is imaginative and for He's good singing.  I didn't finish watching the whole thing, just after Aida's 'Ritorna vincitor' May be I'll pick it up again some other time.",1394323200,,704,4.125
