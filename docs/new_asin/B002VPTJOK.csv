4000652,1,B002VPTJOK,I really enjoyed this movie and laughed out loud at least ten time...of course that was when I saw the movie in Bazarro World.,1260144000,20,126,4.291666666666667
4000653,5,B002VPTJOK,"I read this book and went into the theater with high expectations for the movie. I expected a lot more scenes out of the book to be filmed, however I was wrong. That's understandable because of the limited time a movie has. It didn't matter tho. I couldn't stop laughing while watching this film. It's a must buy! You can't go wrong watching this movie over and over again.",1258675200,9,373,4.420289855072464
4000654,1,B002VPTJOK,"I saw this movie when it came out. It's so-so. There's not any really memorable lines. I don't think I'd want to pay $20 for the DVD. Maybe $10?

If you can get it for $10, sure, why not?

EDIT:

Upon rewatching the movie, I didn't really laugh the second time through. The humor is dated and Tucker's characters has no redeemable qualities. Drew's quips are awkward and forced, and I don't understand why Dan continues to hang out with either one.

I might buy it for $5, or if it was in the dollar DVD bin at Wal-Mart, but if not, no biggie.",1258156800,19,543,4.1923076923076925

4000847,2,B002VPTJOK,"Hilarity does not ensue. Tucker Max's books are funny, this movie is not. If you've read the books, your expectations build in the beginning, but Tucker is not the Tucker of his books, just some weirdo with a dwarf fetish. The ""comedy"" is not funny, more just WTF moments and weird plotlines about a mildly debased bachelor party and a WTF story involving eye drops that most people know hasn't been possible for decades. The film is watchable, so it gets two stars, but you are not missing anything by missing it. It all ends with a smarmy ending not at all like the Tucker of his books. Softened up for mass appeal, but not intelligent enough to be funny. The Tucker of the books may be extremely obnoxious, but he is witty enough to make it funny. This movie is neither witty nor funny. I heard Tucker was in counseling to change his narcissism when this movie was made, so perhaps that is why this movie is half-a**ed, neither classic Tucker Max, nor some socially redeeming story.

The main character gets thru the whole movie never learning his damn lesson but in the finaL scene everyone is just like whatever it doesn't matter.

Another low point for me was the scene that lasted forever too long about Tucker pooping his own pants.  If you want to watch a guy literally crap himself for about 3 minutes this is the movie for you.  Yes you see the poop in the pants, sock and eventually all over the floor and toilet.

Everyone associated with this movie should have their SAG cards burned in public, and the so called ""writers and producers"" should be forced to make documentaries in Waziristan on a $1 a day budget.

4000920,3,B002VPTJOK,"I don't have proof that Tucker ever belonged to a fraternity, but he sure behaves like an ex frat boy.

That said, and he being an ***hole as a given, this book is well worth reading, if you like reading about drunks gone bad (wait, drunks are ALREADY bad, aren't they?).  The chapter in which Tucker visits Odessa, Texas (nearby Midland former home of George W. Bush) and drinks beer with some rednecks as they round up a couple of goats made my ribs hurt I laughed so hard, but the part where he goes to the hockey game and picks a fight with the mascot brought tear to me eyes.  I don't think I've cried--er, laughed--so hard in my entire life.

Basically, lots of fornication and inebriation, not necessarily in that order.  Usually it goes like this.  Tucker goes to a bar, meets a ""chick,"" they get drunk and go to his/her place managing to avoid the cops along the way and culminate the occassion with wild, drunken sex.  Both sides try not to vomit, although at times that is not possible.  The next morning he runs away, if possible, so that he can repeat the process with a totally new and (unsuspecting?) woman the next evening.

I give this book three stars because as funny as he is, I think that Tucker doesn't set a very good example for anyone and I don't necessarily condone this sort of behaviour so I'm withholding two stars.  But, he is brutally honest, even though he's a brutally honest ***hole.

If that's not enough, the ignorant jokes keep on coming without any purpose or any desire to even create a storyline.  The jokes are also said in a quick-witted and creative way, and none of it is even remotely funny.  Sorry, but there comes a point where it's obvious a line has been crossed, and this movie is a perfect example of line crossing in its most brutal form.  Ugh.

However, there IS a saving grace.  Since the storyline is about a group of young men going around strip joints and humiliating women with clever intelligent wording, it's the way the storyline unfolds and gradually improves (and most importantly, the message BEHIND the storyline and how it's totally wrong to disrespect women to this extent) that actually makes the film not a complete disaster, and even allows it to approach ""good"" in a few spots towards the conclusion.

The final 45 minutes of storytelling involving a toilet/wedding incident really does save the movie from an easy 1-star rating.

However, there's no denying that the first 30 minutes were designed with the intention of just completely making women look like horrible human beings in every conceivable way with no storyline to speak of, and it's completely unacceptable in my book.

I really hope women despise this movie, and I hope most men out there hate it just as much.  Thank God the moral of the story saves it somewhat.  Besides that, the storyline itself barely qualifies as good and the acting is secondrate at best.",1288224000,6,1914,4.795731707317073

It has a lot of offensive material in it(mainly bashing women), but at the same time we thought it was all well placed and the characters are speaking from their hearts(or elsewhere) and they don't pull any punches. The bathroom scene with Tucker is one of the funniest things I have ever witnessed in my life! I fell out of the bed laughing so hard. Shoot, I'm laughing right now thinking about it as I'm writing.

Don't listen to a few of these haters on here who obviously have very controlling girlfriends or wives. I am married, and like I said, my wife thought it was hilarious too. If you get offended by a movie folks, well, I feel sorry for you. I love stereotyping people, and these characters deliver in this area ten fold.

4000939,3,B002VPTJOK,"Let me begin by saying that I believe many of the over-the-top negative reviews of this movie are submitted by people who were offended by the content or characters and are afraid to say it. Grow up.

This is a movie for people who enjoy social spectacle, venomous one liners, and ridiculing posers.

Things I liked: The ""Drew"" character's dialogue, if not the actor's delivery at times. The ""Tucker"" character when he was doing what he does best.

Things I didn't like: Hollywood interference with the characters and events. It's easy to see it if you've read the book. Basically they took some of Tucker's stories and shoehorned them into a standard plot sequencing. (Characters are introduced, harebrained plan develops, rock music montage, hi-jinks ensue, events go awry, sad music montage, lead character learns lesson and tries to make amends, ""I learned something today"" speech, happy music plays as party ensues and credits roll.) I think the actors had the characters down very well, and the only time I noticed awkwardness was when the forced plot structure demanded incongruent behavior.

It goes without saying that the book is better; always is. The redeeming value of the movie is the ""pure"" parts of it when the actors are allowed to bring the characters and stories to life. Everything said, it's worth a watch if you like pointed humor and can take a joke. You don't have to like Tucker as a person to enjoy his antics.",1283558400,2,1436,4.848979591836735

4000943,1,B002VPTJOK,"I reasonably enjoyed the book, up until the end when it started getting a little tedious.  Most of the stories were pretty outrageous, if somewhat repetitive.

This movie, however, has almost nothing in common with the book.  It's loosely based on one story in the whole collection.  A better platform might have been a series of shorts or something, but trying to tie it all in with the crappiest, lamest story arc I have ever seen was a pretty horrible move.  The casting was awful, especially in the part of Drew, the smart-ass, gynophobic, comic-book inclined friend of Tucker.  The movie did nothing to capture the essence of the book, which was essentially a huge recollection of drunken rampages.  The production values are non-existent.  The actors exude no charisma.  The characters in the book were somewhat conflicted and always interesting, except for Tucker.  The characters in the movie are one-dimensional cardboard cutouts.

I watched this out of sheer horror, like watching an asteroid smash into a playground, or watching a semi-truck carrying litters of puppies burst into flame on the interstate.  The whole time I was asking myself:  how bad can a movie truly get?  I can definitely see why this went straight to DVD.

The saddest part of this sordid affair is Tucker Max himself defending this movie, saying that it has the potential to become a cult classic.  If by cult classic he means misunderstood during it's time, or so bad it's great, it's not quite at that level.  Expect this at the bargain bin at K-Mart sometime in the near future.",1278028800,10,1565,4.867424242424242

Not for everyone, but I love it. I have read the book over and over and laugh every time. I highly recommend you buy the book. This movie? I kept waiting for it to get funny and turn ""Tucker Max"" but it never happened. The only actor I enjoyed was ""Drew"". The others just never really clicked. Seems that there was so much more that could have been done with the story - from the stories - to make it funnier (or even a decent) movie to watch. The really funny parts of Tuckers stories are his descriptions of his interactions with others when he has been drinking - which is so hilarious in the book/stories (like the exchange with the girls in the bar). ROFL funny in the book, just plain painful in the movie. It was like watching a Made for TV Drama about Three Guys on a Road Trip rather than a Comedy. Honestly, I am glad I bought it and watched it because I want to support Tucker for all the laughs he has given me over the years, but this movie... It just makes me wonder if Tucker actually watched it (sober) and thought ""Dayum! This is sweet!"" because I find it hard to believe he put his stamp of approval on it.

The book is hilarious.  Chapter after chapter, young master Max hits and quits girl after girl.  He's a genuinely funny narrator, even if you can't really feel any sympathy for him or his plight (even his humiliation at wildly defecating across a hotel lobby).  He's a cad.  And proud of it.

So now they tried to adapt this master work of hedonism to film.

The first thing I notice: the women are human.  They're even smart and capable of taking on Tucker and his jibes and ruses.  This was not in the book.  He goes through woman after woman and they all appear to be suckers for his scams.  So when one of the strippers becomes a quick-witted single mom I was falling in love with...I forgot where this movie came from.  The movie forgot where it came from.

But it does make nice points and ties things up rather tidily, something I wondered how they could do with this wild man's life.

I have since come, through the bitterest of experiences, to believe that many individuals like him are sociopaths. I can testify from personal experience that they posses the following personality characteristics as stated in the DSM-IV, ""superficial charm, promiscuous sexual behavior/infidelity, pathological lying, and conventional appearance,"" but to name a few. They are toxic, and above all dangerous individuals, this is illustrated by the fact that most serial murderers are indeed sociopaths. If you accidentally let one of these reprobates into you're life, they will, as is their nature eventually turn on you. They will then maliciously attempt to destroy you're life, personally, professionally, and even physically with wreck-less abandon.

The book is much funnier than the film but don't think that Max has many redeeming qualities. He admits that he's a womanizer and makes no apologies for it. Does it make him misogynistic? This is briefly called into question in the film. The word actually means hatred of women. So, does Tucker Max hate women? No. In fact, if it weren't for them, he wouldn't fulfill his juvenile fantasies and conquests. But I can say that he's definitely disrespectful of women. He definitely has no respect for them. And yet, he still has women all over him. The quandary of this is brought to brilliant light by his best friends (Geoff Stults and Jesse Bradford -- the true pseudo-misogynist of the film). Nevertheless, if you're a guy this film is entertaining and funny. If you're a woman, you might not be so entertained. My favorite character in the film wasn't even male. I really enjoyed the character of Lara (Marika Dominczyk), who gave Bradford's character a run for his money and didn't put up with any of his crap. That's the kind of character I like.

Overall, don't waste your money buying, renting or even borrowing the movie from a friend.  Just read the book and end it there.",1265068800,12,748,4.188811188811189
4001022,2,B002VPTJOK,A very boring movie based on a very funny book.  This movie is not funny and actually a snooze; I had to literally force myself to pay attention to it.  The story is so cliched and just not humorous.  The characters are unimaginative & uninteresting.  I didn't care about a single character in this movie.  The Drew character was horribly acted.  The movie itself looks like amateur hour - I've seen better production on Youtube & Funny or Die.  I would not tell anyone to waste their time on this flick.,1264982400,26,504,4.472527472527473
4001023,1,B002VPTJOK,"I have seen some god-awful movies over the years, (e.g. Leonard Part Six, Howard the Duck and Gigli) but I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell is by far the worst movie that I have ever suffered through.

The characters are all douchebags who are completely irredeemable, and the jokes, such as there are, are dated, lame and unfunny. The production values are atrocious, especially the lighting. I've seen student films that looked better than this.

Don't waste your time watching this, to say nothing of your money. Trust me, the two hours that you'll save not watching IHTSBIH could be put to better use by doing just about anything else.",1264896000,18,635,4.711711711711712
4001034,3,B002VPTJOK,"I saw it in theaters and liked it, but not too much.  It was funny, but something irked me about it.  After watching it a second time, I think I figured out what it was.  The hangover was fantastical.  It never asked you to believe the events in the movie.  I thought it was funny, but yearned for a more realistic comedy, which is what Tucker's movie should have been.  Three friends at law school could have actually done everything in this movie.  However, this movie seems to be at odds with the role it should have played.  From the first mention of the midget in the beginning of the movie, I knew exactly how it would end.  When Tucker revealed his affair with the midget, was it really a surprise to anyone?  That story line fell flat.  Maybe it would have been different if I had not been familiar with Tucker's oeuvre.  I think that Tucker had an excellent opportunity to make a realistic version of the hangover that could have rung very true to its viewers. Unfortunately, he created an ambitious movie, which tries to do too much.  The best comedic timing in the movie I think was when Tucker himself gives the terrible best man speech in the wedding scene.  A lot of the actors could have benefited well from more takes; the dialogue in a lot of the movie seems a bit forced.",1264809600,5,1289,4.383966244725738
4001035,5,B002VPTJOK,"The Pros:
Hilarious, plot-based humor.

The Cons:
Predictable story.

The movie was shot on a relatively low budget, but you can't tell by watching it. It was made extremely well but the marketing wasn't amazing which led to a rather unsatisfying theatrical run.

It comes to my attention that many of the negative reviews on Amazon and generally reviews everywhere aren't addressing issues with /this/ movie, they are addressing issues with Tucker Max as a person. If you do not find this movie funny, then this is a legitimate argument, but finding Mr. Max to be a horrific person is not a reason to slander this movie in such a way.

To the reviewer who said that the positive reviews seemed fake: in what way? That they were thought out and typed with thought rather than rattled off on a whim?

I've heard lots of comparisons to The Hangover and this was addressed in what I believe to be the correct way: This movie is to the Hangover as The Simpsons (early run) is to Family Guy. While both were/are funny, Family Guy derives from largely random and situational humor, while The Simpsons derives more humor from its plot.

I hope this DVD makes considerable sales so we can see sequels and I have no doubt it will become a cult classic just as the book has.",1264636800,7,1264,4.546255506607929

4001037,1,B002VPTJOK,"I like a politically incorrect, rude movie as the next guy, but REALLY?!!  This is a ""be careful what you wish for..."" at its worst.

This brings new meaning to the expression ""blowing chunks""  YUCK!!!  GUARANTEED NOT TO BE A DATE FILM!  ie. this is ""Trainspotting"" for Cretins!

4001038,4,B002VPTJOK,"I enjoyed this movie. I am a fan of Tucker max and his book, so maybe that played into my feelings about it a little bit, but I liked it better than the hangover. I kind of wish drew had stayed a jerk ( I like how mean he is) but then, the movie is based on the book, which is real events so  I can't really complain. Not for everyone, just like the book isn't for everyone.",1264550400,11,374,3.7948717948717947
4001039,1,B002VPTJOK,"Where to begin? The main problem with this movie is that there's not a single likable character. The wife comes across as catty. The stripper has a change of heart too quickly to be believable. Drew is bitter, hateful, and delivers his supposedly comedic lines with terrible timing. Most of his humor is topical and extremely dated (Scott Peterson? Who even remembers who that is? Magic Johnson, that's cutting-edge stuff). Dan starts out as kind of a straight man, but gradually becomes as much of a jerk as his friends. And Tucker... well, I'm guessing this movie does a pretty good job at accurately portraying what it would be like to hang out with Tucker in real life. Based on the movies, this is an experience few people would relish. He gets drunk, insults and threatens random strangers, and does his best to embarrass his friends. How could this character possibly be the protagonist?

Overall, I found it very difficult to engage in a movie with slow pacing, an aimless plot, and unlikable characters. Maybe amazing special effects or chase scenes could have redeemed it, but probably not. Frat guys will probably enjoy it.",1264550400,25,1134,4.845360824742268

The tales from book are all tailored in to one event to make this movie flow which I didn't mind at all, instead of watching a bunch of short stories. This movie is about Tucker and his friend's adventure to celebrate a bachelor party with a hidden agenda. The dialect of this film was hilarious to me, I was crying laughing and on the verge of peeing my pants. There are very funny one liners though out. Regardless if you're offended by him or you support him, believe the stories or not... you have to admit, Tucker Max has a talent to tell a story. I originally rented a digital copy of this movie from amazon.com. Because I love the book and enjoy his website, [...] and had a great time with the movie, I will also purchase this DVD to share watch with my friends. The only reason I didn't give this movie a 5 star is because there's not a Blu-ray version.",1263686400,5,1015,4.319371727748691

Everyone in the theatre was laughing hysterically, I have never been to a movie where the entire audience was laughing out loud at once. If you've read the book or know who Tucker Max is you already know what you're in for, if not, well it's not exactly the most PC movie. Be prepared for crude jokes about women-I'm a girl and completely loved it regardless.

I recommend this movie and the book to college kids. It's just a guy writing about all of the shenanigans he got into in his early 20's.
