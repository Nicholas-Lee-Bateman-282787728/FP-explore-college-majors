8390298,3,B00375LBIA,"I do not own this video - I rented it from my library.  I'm in the process of previewing videos for possible purchase.  I am a 68 yr old grandma - currently interested in doing yoga for strength and flexability.  I cannot do floor poses due to disc herniation in my lower back.  This workout might be a possibility for me in the future, but not now.  If you are considering this video, you should know that these are STANDING poses, and FLOOR poses.  None of the poses are done with a chair, be it seated or standing while holding onto a chair for balance.  I have found the yoga videos by Peggy Cappy to be a better choice for me.  Hope this helps someone!",1438992000,,657,4.2
8390299,1,B00375LBIA,I think even the most novice person would find this DVD way too slow and  boring. I'm still looking for a yoga DVD that explains each movement/exercise at a pace that a beginner can follow without putting me to sleep.,1397347200,,217,4.425
8390300,4,B00375LBIA,"Gentle Yoga.  Great yoga for beginners, lots of stretching, calm pace.  Instructor is gentle, has you do things at own pace after first couple moves.",1358380800,,149,4.92
8390301,5,B00375LBIA,"Due to my former job & the heavy lifting of luggage amounting to close to a ton each day for me, I aquired arthritis & muscle damage in both hips, tendonitis in both shoulders as well as arthritis in one ankle.  No to mention a pinched nerve in my lower back.  Walking any distance was extremely painful, going up steps was bad enough but even lifting groceries going up those steps was torture.
I've been using ""Gentle Yoga Senior"" every day for almost a month.  If I skip a day I can tell the difference, especially with the pinched nerve.
I wasn't sure what to expect with this but I'm so very happy I purchased this.  I love the part when she says ""if you can, lay your rib cage on your leg"".  My first thought was ""does 'use to' count"".  I ""use to"" be able to do that but now I can't.  I know that if I keep up with Shay & her yoga class I WILL be able to put my rib cage on my leg.
I find that I'm stretching more & more & the feeling is wonderful.
Thank you Shay Eastham for this wonderful lesson.

8390302,3,B00375LBIA,"It was O.K., but the instructor is less than motivating.
I liked how she got up and watched the others doing it, while not doing it all herself. Would not recommend it. I want someone to motivate me....",1294963200,,202,4.342105263157895
8390303,5,B00375LBIA,"This is a great way to introduce Yoga to a beginner at any age, but especially to new students over 50. I recommend it to my massage clients who want to do Yoga, are uncomfortable going to classes and not able to follow other yoga DVDs, even those created with seniors in mind.
Shay Eastham's approach is indeed gentle and she is a wonderful guide. I highly recommend this DVD to people who would like to do Yoga but think they're too old to start. I also recommend it to seasoned Yoga enthusiasts as a shift in pace and practice.

8390304,5,B00375LBIA,"I bought this dvd because I haven't been able to go to a yoga class.  I really like the pace of the class that is being taught and how the instructor says to do it at your own pace.  I don't feel rushed like those shows on television where there is no way you can keep up.  I also like that the women in the class are at different levels of ability, that makes it seems so normal.  I really like this video and recommend it to all beginners or older people who haven't done yoga in a while.",1271462400,5,490,3.919191919191919
8390305,5,B00375LBIA,"I purchased this DVD for my father.  He won't exercise.  Yet he complains about flexibility and his fading strength.  The DVD sat on the TV for a week.  Then  I came over and did it with him.  What an amazing experience.  The woman definitely knows what she is doing and has a very calming voice.  Its not cheesy, nor over-produced.  My dad has been doing it by himself now 3 times a week and calls me everyday and tells me how great he feels.  Now I have a way to connect with my aging father and we both feel great.  I would highly recommend it.  Music is soothing and cool too!",1270080000,8,580,4.126126126126126
8390306,5,B00375LBIA,I had been to many yoga sessions at gyms and health clubs. The instructors only know one routine and there is no help to accomodate each individual. This DVD allowed me to modify the session's poses to what I could realistically do. Finally a yoga practice that I will do daily. I highly recommend this DVD for those who think they can not do yoga.,1269993600,6,348,4.369230769230769
