If every student had a teacher like Sang-Jin - believing in YOU, supporting YOU, encouraging YOU, and being tough on YOU - wouldn't we too achieve our dreams....unafraid !!!  I love how tough guys have tender hearts and dreams too !!!",1475366400,,368,4.630769230769231

I bought it, and put it in a DVD player. It was shakey and in black and white. Thinking it might be the DVD player, I out it in another one, it was still black and white, and off-center. (In such a way that you can't see half of them, and you can't read the subtitles)

So, I thought I just got a bad DVD, so I returned it, and bought another one. Same problem.

I was thinking that it might not work in American DVD players, but it claims to be region free. And there was a bad smell inside both DVD cases, so I think they all were damaged by something.

And since this is the only DVD of this on Amazon, I'm going to look on an entirely different website now.",1405555200,,709,3.9027777777777777
