He doesn't know how bad it is because he gets to watch military jets, but oh my gosh... it's so bad. And the hidden agenda is even worse than the dialogue lag being switched to English. It's SO BAD. And it gets really weird when the female helicopter is tekking Petey, ""I trust you. I feel safe with you"" in an oddly passive voice. Just a WEIRD and TERRIBLE show.",1500595200,,493,4.25531914893617

The incredible amount of suspense that director Qian Feng was able to build up over the course of this 72 minute epic can only be summarized in one word. However, this movie may not be appropriate for children as it depicts in gruesome detail the rotten carcass of the plane known as Drake. Other than that, the characters are dynamic, relatable, and their dialogue is very realistic.

Don't waste your time. Or that of your children. I started watching this as a possible movie to share with the family, but it disappoints on every count.

I thought it was from Pixar, due to the imagery, but this movie sucks in every way. No subtle humour, no complex plot, no redeeming of heroes.

Save your money and time, this thing is an awful ripoff, in the way that we think of Chinese stuff in our modern era.

7587973,1,B01A19LUSA,"Occasionally a film comes along that serves as a reminder to us all that creating a computer generated animated feature film isn't anywhere near as easy as Pixar makes it look.  The Adventures of Petey and Friends is precisely such a film; the literal opposite of all the magic and wonder that have made movies like Cars and Planes so endearing.  But before we take a look at precisely which ingredients are to blame for this films failures, lets try and dig up some hard facts on the production.

The Adventures of Petey and Friends comes to us by way of China; specifically Ori Animation under the directorial hand of Lucas Qiao and written by Fang Wen.

Its important that we make one point very clear- the film was written for and acted in Chinese initially.  Like so many direct-to-DVD animated films here in the US, a production company (in this case Uncork'd Entertainment) bought the rights to the film, slapped an English dub over the top of the visuals and released it as a finished product.

To date, this tactic as a means of delivering a quality animated motion picture has worked almost never.  And Adventures of Petey is no exception.  It was released here in the States on February 2, 2016 and comes in at a run-time of 74-minutes.

So whats the story about here?  The official summary reads like this: Desert Sky Air Force Base is instructed to carry out an urgent mission. At the same time, a new fighter plane, Petey arrives by forced landing. In order to rescue Petey's best friend Drake who is lost in the desert, Larry the best fighter plane of the Base, is ordered to perform the task. As a result, a competition is held between Petey and Larry. Petey is determined to carry out the most important task by himself in order to rescue his best friend.

In practice, this is a very, very generous assessment of what tries to pass for a plot.  The actual experience of watching this movie is an exercise in tedium as scenes don't serve as moments in time, assembled to tell a greater narrative so much as they simply exist- one to the next in the hopes that somehow a story will manifest before the conclusion.

As I am unable to speak or read Chinese, it is impossible for me to speak on how well Uncorkd preserved the original story in their English dub but the meandering nature in which the material is presented here certainly lends suspicion to the idea that they didn't do well at all.

Right from the onset things get murky in a hurry.  The film opens with a horrendous sandstorm that separates two planes.  From there we find ourselves on the Desert Sky Air Force Base with a living control tower seeking volunteers to go on a rescue mission to find one of the downed planes.  As all of the planes, jets, and choppers in attendance beg to be the one chosen to do so (cant send them all I guess?), the tower decides to have a contest to pick the winner.  So far, so reasonable, right?

It seems this contest takes place over the course of the opening credits and while this is all going on, one of the two planes involved in the prior nights storm sneaks into the very same base through a hole cut in the fence and begins to steal fuel.  This brown jet, it turns out, is Petey.  Um, doesnt the cover make it look like Petey is the little green prop plane?

Eh, it doesnt really matter.  By the time you reach the half-hour point (if you make it that far), you will come to the unavoidable conclusion that there is no way youll endure another 47-minutes of this torture.

The visuals, which I am cautious never to rely on when making or breaking a film in critique, are equally lackluster- with washed out background textures, endless brown desert-scapes and character models that look like rubberized versions of the rejects from Wings.

All in all The Adventures of Petey and Friends is a stunningly powerful example in everything that can go wrong in the world of CG animated feature film An abysmal story mated to lousy acting coupled to below-average visuals and absolutely no comedy, cleverness or character.  About the films greatest strength is its relatively brief run-time, though even then youll marvel at how long 74-minutes can feel.",1487203200,,4172,4.551539491298527
7587974,2,B01A19LUSA,"Truly a terrible movie for anyone over 6. The characters are incredibly boring and their motivation is non-existent. That said, my 3 year old and 4 year old enjoyed it as the dialogue is very simple (and often repetitive) and the plot has no twists or turns (and actually seems to borrow heavily from both Cars and Planes - which admittedly aren't that original either). The only real reason I can give to suffer through this (and why it didn't rate 1 star) is that if your children are young enough, and have already seen all the Cars movies and all the Planes movies, then this is something they may enjoy. That said, save yourself some pain by making sure that while they are watching, you are either in a different room or have headphones on.",1486684800,,746,4.492647058823529

7588058,1,B01A19LUSA,"First off, this is not a movie for adults. The animation truly is horrible, and the dialogue and plot seem like something my toddler comes up with as he's playing with his toys. But that's fine- if you're expecting the nuanced plot and humor of a Pixar film you're going to be bored out of your mind.  It's made for kids and kept them entertained while I worked on other things.

What's not fine is the ending. Most of the movie focuses on Petey "" competing"" to rescue his friend Drake, who crashed in the desert. But- spoiler alert- Drake has been dead the whole time, the others blame Petey for ""killing"" him, and he blames himself, too and never forgives himself. So, I had to explain to my kids why Drake- presumably as cute and personable as the other anthropomorphic airplanes- never wakes up when they show his crashed body on the desert floor. There's no moral lesson with it, they just leave him there and fly away to pick up a cargo box with a tractor beam. Or something.

So if you'd like to torture yourself be watching this unsalvagable mess AND scar your kids for no good reason, this is the movie for you. Otherwise, avoid it like the plague.",1474761600,9,1157,4.422535211267606

8746382,1,B01A19LUSA,"I had high hopes for this movie because my 14-month-old LOVES airplanes, but after the opening scenes where the airplanes performed all kinds of fancy aeronautic tricks, the movie quickly went downhill as soon as the characters started to have dialog. These are presumably planes accomplished enough to have earned acceptance at a base where they were being trained by more senior planes, and there is but one female helicopter character, Kylie, whose only purpose, apparently, was to fawn and obsess over the brooding, troubled Petey character once he arrived on the scene, even being in need of literal rescue at some point. Both Petey and Kylie represent tired old tropes that perpetuate the ""rogue rockstar"" and ""damsel in distress/love interest"" personas so pervasive in poorly-thought-out storylines. Kylie literally had no other explanation for her character except to fall for and support Petey, who, for most of the movie, is dismissive of her at best and abusive at worst.

If someone would dub over this movie with a more inspiring storyline, it might have merit, but the dialog as it is is embarrassing.",1516406400,,1115,5.092896174863388
