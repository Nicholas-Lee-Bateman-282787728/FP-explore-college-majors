8220242,5,B00008FJVN,"This is a London VHS tape of a concert recorded at the Budapest Convention Center on 28 November 1990. It was Sir Georg Solti's triumphant return to Hungary after many years' absence. It was also the Hungarians first chance to hear Solti and the Chicago Symphony, one of the world's best orchestras, playing the music of their greatest composer.

And how they play! The entire concert is white hot with energy; the precision and power of the orchestra is quite amazing. Solti gives vigorous, red-blooded performances of the Dance Suite and the Concerto for Orchestra, while Andras Schiff is both poetic and bold in the Third Piano Concerto.

This tape is long out of print and as yet unavailable on DVD. It is an absolute treasure! (London 071 227-3, VHS Hi-Fi Stereo, NTSC, 1991)",1156723200,,780,4.813432835820896
