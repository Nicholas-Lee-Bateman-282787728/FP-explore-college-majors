7912342,5,B00000JKY2,"I watched this presentation because I watched most of the previous Hamlet presentations and was intrigued to find what I could possibly have missed or should have been looking for. I was not disappointed.

This is copyrighted 1990 and depicts a young Kenneth Branagh preparing to play Hamlet on the stage in 1988. I actually saw his 242 minute film where he played Hamlet in 1996. He is being directed by Derek Jacobi who needs no introduction.

I'm not sure that this presentation has a focus; as it is Hamlet in part it also focuses on the actors and the acting in part, and would not focusing on the character of Hamlet actually shows all the elements that goes into a stage production. So we truly see that the play's the thing.

I purposely did not go into more detail as I think you will appreciate the presentation better than anything that I can describe.  I did find the skills and logistics of making the play quite intriguing.",1327708800,2,937,4.559523809523809
7912343,5,B00000JKY2,"In 1996, Kenneth Branagh gave us the screen's first complete Hamlet, uncut and as Shakespeare wrote it. The actor had some solid warm-ups, with cinematic portrayals of Iago (Othello, 1995), Benedict (Much Ado about Nothing,1993) and Henry V (1989).
Then Hamlet came along, a landmark in bringing the Bard to the big screen.
Yet this wasn't Branagh's first brush with the melancholy Great Dane.
In 1988, Branagh's theatre company, The Renaissance, had hired Derek Jacobi (dubbed ""the best Hamlet of his generation"" by The New York Times), to make his directorial debut with this timeless classic in which Branagh starred. We are lucky enough that filmmakers Mark Olshaker and Larry Klein were there from the first reading to the rehearsals to opening night, lucky that Patrick Stewart agreed to narrate and luckier still to have Acorn Media Group's Athena finally release Discovering Hamlet on DVD . . . with enough bonuses to bring a smile to the unhappy Prince's face.
There are lengthy cast and crew interviews, behind-the-scenes footage and wonderful interviews with Jacobi, at once elfin, informative and fascinating as he discusses the trials and tribulations of live performances. Including a twelve page viewer's guide and a history of Hamlets through the ages, this two-disc treasure illustrates the path taken as the torch is passed from generation to generation of brilliant actors playing arguably the greatest part in the English language. From Bard-O-Philes to gross amateurs, Discovering Hamlet belongs on everyone's shelf of great DVDs about great theatre.",1296172800,10,1571,5.313253012048193
7912344,4,B00000JKY2,"A team of renown Hamlets providing educational behind-the-opening-night reality of stage preparation. Excellence for that use. I have years of experience as set designer/construction/crew with community theater. This is an honest look, but on a professional level, the very best of Hamlet professionalism. It's Derek Jacobi's (Cadfael-a must view) 1st directing and Kenneth Branagh's (Henry V, Hamlet) first Hamlet acting, although he went on to win awards with his Directing/Lead/Writer of a DVD version of Hamlet-1996. What better teachers of Shakespeare? Try ""Playing Shakespeare"" on DVD for one.

This is a must for serious acting students. Footage is gleaned from 30+ hrs of footage made during the 4 weeks of prep for Hamlet. From the raw 1st read, through rehearsals & tech rehearsals, up to opening night prep; it's an in-depth behind-the-curtain look at theater never seen by most patrons. It's honest, it's with preparatory flaws, but yet it's 'grease-paint' excitement. Illuminating educational theater. A lesson, 1st time on DVD, for acting want-to-be's (or not to-be's). Sorry!  :-)

There are other stars like Sophie (Emma's sis)Thompson. Narration is provided by Patrick Stewart. Performed in Birmingham, this pre-show footage gives a lot of tips and fun looks at building up to perfection in theater. Even a sword fight. All in 53 minutes. If that's not enough, there is huge elaboration on this with the first-time-seen 3+ hours of bonus. Subtitles included for the feature.

==Deric Jacobi Extended Interviews:
'On Directing' 33 min, 1988; '2 1/2 Weeks In' 7 min; 'On Shakespheare & Performing' 12 min shot after opening night.
==Cast/Crew Interviews: 'Kenneth Branagh' 4 min; 'Russel Jackson' 8 min; Sophie Thompson' 8 min; 'Costume Super' 7 min; 'Set Designer' 2 min.
==Behind-the-Scenes: 'Dir. Notes' 22 min; 'Directing the Cast' 10 min; 'Sword Fight Choreography' 14 min; 'Rehearsal Act 2 Scene 2': To be, or not to be, 12 min; 'Rehearsal Final Scene': Good night sweet prince, 17 min; 'Cast Party' Swan Light & 11 min.

Also the traditional Athena booklet, this one 9 pages of text & photos in 'A Viewer's Guide.' Excellent.

So what's the problem? Why 4 stars? It's not for everyone. Not a true performance, just preparing for the performance, which the DVD viewer never gets to see this Hamlet in it's entirety. A bit of the bonus material seems to be from the 'editing floor'; not aimed to any speaker/person, not focused, dark, with some bad sound, with background motor noise. I'll bet acting students will overlook this negative bit, to be able to hear the excellent directing-coaching usable by the novice to a professional. That's not me--I painted set pieces--my forte.

Bottom line on purchase?
A smashing lesson presented on DVD for acting want-to-be's.
Educational footage of what it is like to prepare for a show.
Perfect for University, Public, and HS library.
Sorry about the length of this review,
""Good night sweet prince.""",1292630400,29,3525,5.41970802919708
7912345,4,B00000JKY2,"This documentary is a great overview not only of 'Hamlet', but the dedication and commitment it takes to 'put on a show'.  This production, performed in Birmingham, England and directed by Derek Jacobi, showcases a young Kenneth Branagh in his first professional attempt at the role.  From the first rehearsals, to fight scenes, to interviews with all involved, to the director's notes (a good scene where Branagh is picked on a little by Jacobi), to the eventual performance, this is an excellent primer for what it takes to do this complex play live.  Worth watching.",1021766400,11,569,4.968421052631579
7912346,4,B00000JKY2,"Nothing is so interesting as the actual process of creation leading to a final product, in this instance, the performance of Hamlet.  With Discovering Hamlet, a documentary featuring a production staged at the Birmingham Rep Theatre Company and directed by the fine stage and film actor, Derek Jacobi,  the performance highlights young Kenneth Branagh as Hamlet.  Knowing that Branagh too would stage is own stunning full-length production of Hamlet on film, observing how the actor matured from this early performance is a unique opportunity for comparison with his latter work also with Jacobi in the role of Claudius.
Following Jacobi as he shapes actor's performances and staging for the play, this video is privy to insight from technical staff as well.  Narrated by Patrick Stewart and featuring actors who graced stage and films familiar to audiences, the construction of Shakespeare's tragedy is worthy of several viewings.  While Jacobi differs from the more traditional interpretation of Hamlet's ""To Be or Not to Be"" soliloquy as a speech between Hamlet and Ophelia, the complex staging is Jacobi's own and unfortunately not alotted more time.  Although brief in length, the production is filmed from first rehersal to opening night jitters.  A new documentry could be titled ""Critiquing Branagh"" whose performances are faulted today, but in this setting, the actor is still fresh and vunerable to his director's insights to the lead actor's faults.
An excellent opportunity for students of film and performance studies to see process, it is worth purchase if only to have a record of one of Branagh's early stage performances before he became a film star.  It would be interesting to haveJacobi's production restaged based on this film for another perspective on the never dull Shakespearean masterpiece of The Tragedy of Hamlet.",1010880000,23,1841,5.280821917808219
7912347,5,B00000JKY2,"For anyone interested in a behind the scenes look at how a play proceeds through production this video is for you.  The Birmingham Repertory Theater is the setting for this production directed by Derek Jacobi with Kenneth  Branagh taking the lead as Hamlet.  Narration is provided by Patrick  Stewart to guide viewers through the production process.  Interspersed  between scenes of the rehearsals are interviews with the various actors  discussing their characters.  I would have like a longer interview with the  director, Derek Jacobi, discussing his vision of Hamlet but all in all this  is quite a good video.",947548800,32,614,5.173469387755102
