3943787,5,B002KQ6UE2,Loved all 5 seasons. Wish there were 5 more. I felt as though I was saying goodbye to a bunch of old friends.,1360454400,6,109,3.782608695652174
3943788,5,B002KQ6UE2,"After loving this show when it was on, I have been working my way through the series again. the last season was great. It has been so long since I had watched it that it was like a totally new series to me.",1360454400,,206,3.813953488372093
3943789,5,B002KQ6UE2,"I purchased this for my friend, because she could not find it anywhere. She was very surprised when I gave them to her!! She loves them!!!",1360022400,2,138,4.346153846153846
3943790,3,B002KQ6UE2,"I love Ally Mcbeal, but this season is not my favorite.  The things that made me love this show: her wacky imagination, theme songs, dancing babies, were sadly lacking from this season.  I did enjoy Bon Jovi, but not the parade of new characters that didn't seem to have any point.  The finale was disappointing.  It seemed rushed.  Wish the final season had a better ending.",1351209600,8,375,4.621212121212121
3943791,5,B002KQ6UE2,"Just think this show is hilarious! Not in love with calista flockhart, but she works well in this show. Great cast too!",1332201600,,119,4.454545454545454

3943794,3,B002KQ6UE2,The packet includes the 6 discs but is missing 3 episodes.  It is like there shouls be a disc between 5 and 6.  Also does not include the final episode where Ally decides to leave for NYC.  Is this a manufacturing mistake?,1292112000,3,222,4.238095238095238
3943795,5,B002KQ6UE2,"there is only one word for this episode... josh. i have seen him in the states, europe and canada. the first question, of grobanites outside the US is, ""have you seen him on ""ally mc beal""?"" thanks to vcr i could answer, ""omj! yes! i've seen both and i have one on tape."" there are hundreds of grobanites, all over the world, waiting for this to become available.
when i heard he was touring with ""closer"", i told HOG, ""josh? please?"" HOG, ""josh?"" me, ""you know, that kid that sang on ""ally mc beal""."" i found my tape, showed HOG and we went to a concert.",1290816000,4,555,4.245283018867925

3943799,3,B002KQ6UE2,Probably the worst of all the seasons since it seems Flockhart has already checked out along with the writers.  The worst mistake was giving Ally a daughter.  How can someone as neurotic and adorable as Flockhart do an about change and become an adult in the course of a few episodes.  Very disappointing indeed.,1454889600,,312,4.7407407407407405

Music = fingernails on chaulk board too",1413158400,,91,4.411764705882353
3943811,5,B002KQ6UE2,Timeless show that is still as funny and poignant as it was in the beginning.,1411171200,,77,4.2
3943812,3,B002KQ6UE2,Good value.,1407888000,,11,5.0
3943813,5,B002KQ6UE2,Not much on today like a good David Kelly program. I loved this when it was originally broadcast and enjoy just as much now.,1402704000,,124,4.208333333333333
3943814,5,B002KQ6UE2,I love this show!  John Cage with his nose that whistles.  Ally McBeal with her troubles with men and more.,1395619200,,107,4.3
3943815,4,B002KQ6UE2,"I completed watching season 3 last weekend. I just turned on instant video to start watching season 4, only to find that Ally McBeal is no longer available.  Does anyone know why it is no longer available? Is it likely that it will be available in the future? I have only used instant video a few weeks; so, I am curious--- do a lot of TV series ""disappear"" on Amazon?",1390003200,,368,4.257142857142857
3943816,5,B002KQ6UE2,"Just finished watching all 5 seasons...some story lines better than others, but will miss these ""characters""!!!  enjoyed all the ""guest"" stars.",1389312000,,143,5.809523809523809
3943817,1,B002KQ6UE2,"I really liked the first 4 seasons but then they brought in all these new people who really added nothing to the show, except for being annoying. (Dame Edna for one)  It's almost like they ran out of ideas, were sick of the whole thing and decided to end it all without much thought or grace. Too bad because it was, at one time, really enjoyable.",1388793600,3,347,4.257575757575758
3943818,3,B002KQ6UE2,"The final season of Ally McBeal seemed like the writers wanted to throw everything on the wall and see what would stick. The show cut ties with Robert Downey Jr. because of his problems and they looked completely lost. A lot of characters were no longer on the show without any explanation. This made things weird when Ally needed to talk to someone, she no longer had her best friend and roommate, nor did she have a psychologist. This season added a lot of characters and at times seemed like a completely different show. Some of the new characters worked and others were pretty bad. Bon Jovi was a nice addition, though his character was never anything more than what Ally needed. I found it strange that he was at her house so much, especially in the beginning when they had no real relationship. I'm happy the show got an ending, but the season is just watchable with some good moments.",1388534400,3,891,4.540372670807454
3943819,3,B002KQ6UE2,Several new characters.  This season gives too much time to Clare who I personally do not think is all that funny.,1386374400,2,114,4.428571428571429
3943820,1,B002KQ6UE2,"It is obvious they gave up on the show. This season is just all over the place, and not in a good way.",1385942400,5,102,3.4782608695652173
3943821,5,B002KQ6UE2,"WIsh it wasn't over! I  loved all the seasons and thank Amazon Prime
for offering this program. Don't miss it!",1385683200,,110,4.5
3943822,5,B002KQ6UE2,"I watched this series from the very first episode and laughed my heart out!  Calista Flockhart and cast were awesome!  Loved Vonda Shepherd's songs with Barry White as well.  Glad to have it on DVD now, so I can watch it all over again and double over with laughter!!  :)",1384560000,,271,4.36
3943823,5,B002KQ6UE2,"Although, this isn't as good as season 2 or 3 it still beats anything thats on tv today. A few highlights of this season are the whole group singing to John, cameos by Boz Scaggs and Mariah Carey, and Ling as a judge is just a laugh riot! The writing is muddled as you can tell they weren't sure where to go when Robert Downey Jr. fell off the wagon in season 4. I loved John Michael Higgins are Ally's new therapist and his C-word ticks.",1384214400,,438,4.104651162790698
3943824,5,B002KQ6UE2,I loved everything about this goofy show and assortment of characters.  They have foibles like the rest of us.  Writing is strong.,1384214400,,130,4.863636363636363
3943825,5,B002KQ6UE2,"Ally McBeal is fun to watch, the music is great and it provides easy entertainment.  It is interesting to see the characters then and now as many of them have gone on to be Hollywood stars.",1383696000,,189,4.25
3943826,2,B002KQ6UE2,"I loved the first two season, third one was ok - but the fourth and fifth season are just not good at all. You could see that they were trying to bring in guest stars to give the show a boost...",1380499200,2,194,3.7560975609756095
3943827,1,B002KQ6UE2,"I bought seasons 1-3 recently because I LOVE this show. Never saw seasons 4 and 5, so I got them from the library. Glad I did (and this review is NO reflection on Amazon or its PERFECT service for me to date) Season 4 was fantastic. Season five started off okay, but sank quickly. Like the last seasons of Smallville and Charmed, it was like the writers were all killed in a tragic train crash...and the custodians were called in to quick-finish the series. What's with the purple-haired dike and the watered down dialogues of Rikki and the cleverly-inserted daughter? I started fast-forwarding through the purple-hair scenes and finally quit 4 shows before Season 5 ended. Too much damage for a recovery. Even the music was overall ineffectively interjected and not as effective as prior seasons (except Todd Rundgren's ""We Gotta Get You a Woman""). It was a sad finish...but that's just my take. Anyone else have any coherent thoughts? Bruce C",1378252800,3,944,4.833333333333333
3943828,5,B002KQ6UE2,"I followed all the entire 5 seasons when originally aired.  This season completes my set.  If you love Ally McBeal, you just can't be without buying the entire 5 season set.",1375142400,,173,4.548387096774194

3943832,4,B002KQ6UE2,This was a good season and ending for the series. I think season one is still the best of them all.,1363392000,,99,3.761904761904762
3943833,3,B002KQ6UE2,"Aspect ratio is ""letterbox"" NOT Full Screen 1:33.1 as it was originally  broadcast.
Season # 1 is Full Screen and completely meets my expectation.",1363046400,,146,5.083333333333333
3943834,5,B002KQ6UE2,Although the final season wasn't as great as the first. It was interesting to watch the characters grow. It was Tito bad that season 4 didn't end with her wedding.,1361836800,,163,4.466666666666667
3943835,5,B002KQ6UE2,Great series.... I really enjoyed this season especially the one with Josh Groban.  Calista is a talented actress for sure.,1361145600,,123,5.15
