1421775,3,B00005BCP6,"A group of young people go to a tropical island to ""blood surf"", cut themselves and surf in shark-infested waters and make a documentary about it. Soon they realize that there's not only sharks, but also a gigantic crocodile, eating everybody who trespasses his area. It also has some subplot about some modern day pirates and a revengeful sightseeing boat captain.
The screenplay is very silly and quite bad. The lead characters are stupid (otherwise they wouldn't be blood surfing) and don't seem to care much when some of their friends gets killed. Most of the actors are mediocre at best, except for Katie Fischer, who plays the photographer, Cecily. The editing is also quite poor and manages to ruin one scene that could have been quite cool. The worst thing about the movie, however, is probably the extremely bad crocodile FX. It doesn't even move its legs while swimming.
So, this is not a good movie, and I didn't expect it to be. Still, it is entertaining enough to be a painless way to kill one and a half hours if you're bored and don't have too high expectations on it.",1016409600,9,1083,4.645833333333333

1421777,3,B00005BCP6,"Blood surfing, the new extreme sport of this millennium.  Get some cheesy, overacted surfer dudes and throw them in some shark infested, chum laden water and let them go.  Sounds like the makings for a fun action/adventure/horror movie. But Trimark apparently wasn't convinced; they wanted more, so the director gave them more.
After just barely getting out of the water without becoming lunch, the ""brooding"" surfer dives back in to save the beautiful camera lady from the increasingly wild group of sharks.  Narrowly dodging both tooth and fin the crew all make it to the surface alive, and after witnessing what seems to be a brutal inter water grudge match between warring jaws clans, they decide to call it a day, and head inland...........Where they are attacked by a group of Colombian terrorist, Rambo's friend stealing paramilitary types, captured, brought back to their boat and threatened with rape and torture.
You can almost hear the pitch guy, sweating dripping from his brow. The executives didn't like the shark idea, and it's up to him and him alone to save the movie.  ""Well it's not only the sharks, you see these sleazy Colombian coke smugglers types show up and pull them all onto a boat."" He scans the room, they all appear a little happier, but not much, then it hits him. ""Where they are all attacked by the biggest Salt Water Crocodile the world has ever seen.""  Smiles all around, the movie is saved.
Blood Surf's ""story"" is pulled in more directions than the Backstreet Boys thrown into a Junior High Girl's Gym Locker Room.  We've got hot shark dodging action, Terrorist attacks, wild jungle traps, a surfer's love affair with a beautiful, yet underage local girl. Oh yea, and the Cheesiest Crocodile the world of Giant Crocodile Cinema has ever seen.  The underwater scenes alone are enough to make anybody roll on the floor laughing.  What looks like a rubber crocodile on a string, bluescreened into these stock footage underwater shots, shooting through the ocean with a menacing wiggle.
I couldn't say that I would recommend this movie to most people, but I must stress that for anybody with a love of the cheesy, this film will qualify as a must.  Never before have I born witness to such audacity, ripping off entire scenes from other (and better) films with a reckless abandon that one wonders if the movie is trying to crawl into out and out parody.  Remember the scene in Jaws where Quint slips down the wet floor of the sinking boat and into the shark's mouth, Its here.  Remember the scene in Crocodile where the croc flips the kid with the died red hair up into the air and it comes back down landing in its mouth. That one's here to.  Shots at Rambo, Moby Dick, Point Break, and even a little Indiana Jones all come together to form this stew of low budget, American exploitation cinema.

1421807,2,B00005BCP6,"What is it with giant crocodile movies? Jeez.

Once again we've got a group of pretty, young people out for adventure who find themselves the target of a blood-hungry giant croc. Once again, the beast chomps through everyone and everything until the final two people make a last stand and live to tell the tale. Once again I couldn't care less about anything that happened.

In the latest snooze fest, 2001's BLOOD SURF, documentary producer Zack (Matthew Borlenghi, ""The Jeff Foxworthy Show) and his camera operator girlfriend Cecily (Kate Fischer, SIRENS) have drafted two younger surfers, Bog (Dax Miller, THE CONVENT) and Jeremy (Joel West, ""CSI: Miami""), to help them with their latest venture, blood surfing.

The quartet travel to an island where there are shark-infested waters, they dump a bucket of chum in the water to excite the sharks, cut their feet so they bleed into the water too, then surf to shore, trying to outrace the sharks.

The problem is, once they reach shore, before they prepare for another run, something really friggin' big takes out one of the sharks.

Hmm, they think, that was weird. Ok, we'll go again later, then.

Only later the boat that brought them to the island is gone, destroyed by a 31-foot croc, and as the foursome are trying to outrun the beast through the island's jungle, they run into a band of pirates who take them on their boat only to run into the croc themselves. The Americans (and the Australian--Cecily), toss the pirates overboard for the croc, then proceed to catch the boat on fire and have to jump into the water themselves. Before they can be croc-food, though, an old salty ex-adventure boat captain, Dirks, rescues them.

Back on the main island, it was Dirks who refused to show them the way to the shark-infested water, and with good reason. Some time before, his last charter was taken out by the giant croc. He might have mentioned that to someone and, I don't know, had the croc taken care of. Instead, I guess he just went back and said nothing? I don't know, it's never really gone into in any detail. But now that he's back, his plan is revenge against the beast, and he's going to use the documentary crew as bait.

Things end badly and almost everyone dies--I won't reveal who lives, that would spoil it--and the heroes must face off against the giant croc in one last, desperate chase through the island jungle. It's a race for survival! Can they make it?

Does anyone care? I don't. I wish they'd all died, just for coming up with the stupid blood surfing idea in the first place. Der.

My problem with this movie and all others like it stems from the complete unoriginality of the premise. I'm okay with the giant croc, it was well-played in the far superior LAKE PLACID, but the set-up for BLOOD SURF is just so lazy. They use the same set-up as ANY anonymous teens in peril flick. A group of pretty people show up at an ""exotic"" location (be it an island paradise to surf with sharks, an old summer camp to have lots of sex and get wasted, or a ""haunted"" house for whatever lame reason) and, one by one, the cast is picked off by the ""beast"" who rules the area. The names and places may change, but the story is always the same. And while I'll watch these movies, the more of them I see, the less each new one has my attention.

The movie is written by Sam Bernard (WARLOCK: THE ARMAGEDDON) and Robert L. Levy (SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT), with direction by James D. R. Hickox (CHILDREN OF THE CORN III: URBAN HARVEST). Given the credits of two of those guys, I wasn't surprised at how dumb this movie was, but Levy's involvement does surprise me. More successful as a producer (WEDDING CRASHERS and PAY IT FORWARD), I'd have thought this thing would have SOME production value. As it is, it's just as lame and forgettable as all the other movies of its kind.

The characters were a series of one clich after another, and the acting did nothing at all to help the cause. Several times throughout the movie, I could just imagine the scene before filming began: everyone's on their mark, cameras and lights are ready, and director Hickox says ""and OVERACTION!"" And his cast obliges, to everyone's delight.

The effects weren't a total bust. There were a few scenes where the croc's obvious puppetness came through too loud and clear, but that could be as a result of watching the ""bonus footage"" beforehand and seeing the puppeteer manipulate the HAND PUPPET in the water. Other scenes looked like bad CGI. In almost no scenes were the croc and humans shown side by side for comparison, so for all I know it could have been a regular-sized croc chasing them. Lame.

BLOOD SURF isn't the worst movie I've seen. It's not even the worst giant croc movie I`ve seen. I just think its flaws far outweigh any good it brought to the table. I was disappointed mostly in the lack of imagination the plot showed. Sure, blood surfing itself is an interesting premise, I suppose, but the execution of this thing just left way too much to be desired. A by the numbers plot, a totally forgettable script, and more overacting than an Al Pacino/Matthew Lillard buddy movie all keep BLOOD SURF from reaching its full potential--what there was to reach, that is.",1342656000,,5216,4.600645855758881
1421838,3,B00005BCP6,"Originally called ""Krocodylus"" and released in the US in 2001, ""Blood Surf"" is the wackiest crocogator flick I've seen. The plot throws in everything but the kitchen sink in its attempt to entertain; and the croc, when finally seen, is laughably fake-looking.

The pitch-meeting for ""Blood Surf"" possibly went something like this: The pitcher excitedly describes the basic plot: ""A couple of radical surfers go to a tropical island known for shark attacks so they can capture themselves on camera 'blood surfing' -- cutting their feet to bleed and wildly surfing the shark-infested waters."" When he gets a silent reaction, he adds, ""Okay, um, let's see... then this huge saltwater croc comes out of nowhere and starts eating the sharks... and proceeds to chase the surfers on to the island."" More disinterest. ""Where they encounter some Rambo-esque militarists and jungle booby traps a la Indiana Jones."" More solemn looks. ""In addition, the camera operator is a hot Aussie chick and there's also a hot island girl."" An eyebrow or two stirs. ""And one surfer has sex in the surf with the island chick and later discovers she's underaged."" Eye's brighten. ""On top of all that there's a Captain Ahab-like character who's hell-bent on killing the croc."" More interest. ""Who has a skinny girlfriend with a flat chest which she exposes every 10 minutes."" Smiling faces. ""She has a cool dance sequence at the pub-on-the-beach where the dudes ogle in fascination, even though she's really not sexy at all."" Now the pitcher has their undivided attention. ""And she and 'Ahab' have sex on the dock while she's bent over the railing."" Enthralled. ""And we'll throw in a score that sounds like the Beach Boys meets the 60's Batman theme."" ""What about the ending?"" they ask. ""The climatic stand-off will take place in some ancient ruins a la 'Congo'."" Now totally hooked. ""And even though the croc will be laughable and cheap we'll throw in a couple of 'Jaws' homages."" The deal is made.

That's pretty much ""Blood Surf"" in all it's low-budget, odd, irrational non-glory. But, hey, at least it tries hard to be entertaining.

As for the un-sexy, too-skinny, flat-chested girl who keeps exposing herself and trying to be alluring, I couldn't help wonder why the filmmakers added her into the mix. It's really inexplicable since, although she's sorta pretty, she just doesn't cut it, if you know what I mean. But then it hit me that they already have the conventional hot babe (Kate Fischer) and the hot island girl (Maureen Larrazabal), so the creators were evidently giving a nod to all the skinny, non-curvy ladies out there. Not every woman can be Kim Kardashian, after all, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't be given their honored due now and then, kind of like scraps from the table. Just joking. Hey, I'm sure there are some guys out there who find the skinny girl sexy. It takes all kinds to make a world. (And I'm not at all mocking flat-chested women since I don't mind women with small or no breasts, I even used to be involved with one; I'm talking about nigh-anorexic women with zero curves).

The film runs 84 minutes and was shot in the Philipines.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Blood Surf"" is not a good movie in any way, shape or form, but you gotta respect its exuberant attempts to amuse.

1421841,3,B00005BCP6,"A group looking to shoot a surfing documentary somewhere in tropic waters, unexpectedly encounter a huge salt water crocodile, in the creature feature Blood Surf (2001).  This B-movie has decent production values, barely passable special effects, and some silly cartoonish characters.  The story is mostly predictable and goofy, often more going more for laughs rather than scares, and spiced with a little romance and nudity.  Warning, spoilers lie ahead.

Zack Jardine (Matt Borlenghi) of Omega Productions is planning to shoot an edgy documentary, featuring surfers darting among the waves, in shark infested waters.  Cecily (Kate Fischer) is his camera operator, while surfers Jeremy (Joel West) and Bog (Dax Miller) are to be the stars of the movie.

Upon landing at Palm Island, Zack tries to convince John Dirks (Duncan Regehr) a tour boat operator, to act as his guide.  After a little thought, Dirks and his girlfriend Artemus (Taryn Reif) agree to guide them to Lilo Cay Island.  To transport his group, Zack hires the boat of Sonny Lofranco (Chris Vertido), who brings his wife Melba (Susan Africa) and daughter Lemmya (Maureen Larrazabal), along.

Arriving at Lilo Cay, the group dumps a little chum in the water to attract the sharks, and the two surfers make a run while Cecily films the action.  After getting some footage, the group calls it quits, when they see something strange in the ocean.  Sonny and Melba are aboard their boat docked at a pier, when something attacks and sinks it.  Lemmya and Jeremy have slipped away for a little romance.  Unfortunately, while freshening up, Lemmya becomes a crocodile snack.  After recovering their camera gear from the sunken ship, the survivors are attacked by the croc.  When they head inland, they are taken prisoner by some pirates.

At the pirates' boat, Cecily is about to entertain one of the pirates, when the crocodile strikes again.  The pirate ship is destroyed, and Dirks suddenly arrives to rescue the production crew.  Dirks remains near Lilo Cay to make another run at killing the croc he calls ""Salty"".

Blood Surf doesn't have many genuinely scary moments, as the film clearly doesn't have the budget for quality special effects that would be convincing.  Instead, many of the special effects techniques employed are quite laughable.  In the water, the CG croc shown is barely convincing.  On the land, a realistic looking dummy croc is featured, but while it can move its jaws, it doesn't seem capable of walking.  So when this croc moves, it looks like it is being dragged.

The acting isn't outstanding, but at least the characters aren't irritating, and the cheesy special effects and comic atmosphere, tend to make it easier to accept the campy performances.  The surfing element goes out the door pretty fast, and many of the story developments and situations defy logic, but if you can manage to put these matters aside, you might just enjoy this very minor B-movie gem.",1314748800,,2955,5.006147540983607
1421842,2,B00005BCP6,"Blood surfing: -verb. to chum the water with blood in order to surf with sharks. Ex. Two surfers head out to the tropics to make some quick cash blood surfing for a nature photographer, but they run into big trouble when a 31-foot salt water crocodile takes to the waves instead. BLOOD SURF takes a fun idea and destroys it by cramming the film with so many unnecessary subplots that the original story is hardly recognizable by the end. Thankfully, it never tries to be anything more than the silly and stupid B-movie that it truly is. The physical blood surfing only lasts for a single scene, where the visual effects team had their one and only shot to display their terrible computerized sharks. Although John Carl Buechler does slightly better with the mechanical croc, the cheap green-screening makes it look entirely unconvincing. Director James Hickox shamelessly references every key scene in JAWS throughout the picture as well, and the little amount of gore towards the end does nothing to save it. BLOOD SURF can be filed right alongside LAKE PLACID 2, CROCODILE, SUPERCROC, and so many other terrible straight-to-video releases.

1421843,3,B00005BCP6,"Man, I love dumb movies like this.  Let's sail into shark-infested waters, dump a few buckets of chum to attract all of the terrifying beauties, and then hop out there on our surfboards to Hang Ten amongst all the finny goodness.  We'll call it blood surfing.  What could possibly go wrong?  If you're thinking human shark bait, then I'm afraid you're probably not cut out for a career writing or directing low-budget monster movies.  Use your imagination, man!  We're somewhere off the coast of the Philippines, so what if we throw a few horny guerilla fighters on the island?  Ones who've been fantasizing about white women all their lives.  No, that's not enough.  We need something big, something unusual, something the audience won't be expecting.  But what's more scary and deadly than a shark or a guerilla?  Yeah, yeah, of course we have booby traps in the island jungle - I should think that goes without saying.  Wait a minute.  I've got it.  A salt-water crocodile.  No, not just any salt-water crocodile.  I'm talking the biggest, baddest saltie you've ever seen.  Would you believe 31 feet?  Yeah, now we're talking.  Now we've got us a movie worth watching.

I thought the two surfer dudes who signed up for this blood surfing gig were dumb - until the woman shooting the ""blood surfing"" documentary grabbed her camera and jumped into the bloody water wearing nothing more than some skimpy-looking chain mail body suit that wouldn't even protect her from a mosquito bite.  As it turned out, such acts of stupidity would recur time and again as this story played out.  Needless to say, someone is getting eaten before all is said and done.  Sadly, the director does tend to cop out on the gore of the actual killings, but you have to love the periodic ""croc cam"" perspectives and marvel at the sight of a giant crocodile - fake as it is - hurling all 31 feet of itself up out of the water to snatch the human meal of its choosing off of a boat.

Although Blood Surf (also known as Krocodylus) does seemingly borrow a few scenes from other sources (there's even a sailor with an Ahab-like obsession with killing the monster), the whole plot is by-the-numbers, and the giant crocodile is obviously fake, I must say I found the film quite entertaining.  Of course, I'm the type of person who enjoys watching films in which crocodiles attack unimportant and/or annoying characters.  As long as you go into this film with realistic expectations, I don't think you should be too horribly disappointed - if nothing else, you're guaranteed a few laughs.  And just think about this: where else are you going to find two attractive young women flashing a giant crocodile?",1281225600,,2674,4.731601731601732
1421844,1,B00005BCP6,"An amateur movie producer finances a trip for two braindead surfers to venture into danger (make Keanu proud, brah).  The concept: Find a guide to take them to shark-infested waters, drop in some chum, go surfing.  Genius.  Eventually they find a drifter and his woman, a breastless seductress who does some sort of cross between an erotic Lambada, a seizure, and a hyper aerobics routine to get attention (think Hillary Swank possessed by Richard Simmons).  The guy is a complete ripoff of Jon Voigt's character in Anaconda and inserted into the movie strictly to antagonize viewers.  They all make their way to the surf-site, and the shoot looks good - except for the laughably CGI'd sharks ""swimming"" beside the surfers, so fake that they made me think of the Saturday Night Live ""Land Shark"" delivering candy-grams - until a shark blows up.  Yeah, it explodes.

A few scenes later, a 50-foot salt-water crocodile appears out of nowhere, appearing out of the darkness to chomp a cute Islander chick and her family in half.  The crocodile was probably taken from the director's toddler son's toy-chest.  It was probably also responsible for the previous explosions, because later on it appears to set off some C4 on a bamboo bridge.  Read that again.  Back to the ridiculously fake crocodile...which looks worse than the sharks.  This thing jumps 10-feet out of the water, jumps off of cliffs, runs as fast as a deer, plays opossum, has read War and Peace, does a bit of land-surfing in its spare time, makes a mean margarita, and appears to understand basic military strategy.

Following the rules of ""so bad it's good"" movies, the chicks are hot and show full-frontal nudity at the drop of a hat.  Except for the skinemax sex scene between the gnarliest surfer and the islander chick (who gives it up so quickly her first words were most likely ""love me long time""), the action is wretchedly sense-deadening.  The movie's poor excuse for thrills trigger the onset of narcolepsy.  The acting is atrocious.  The script was probably written on extra soft Charmin or bar napkins.  Aside from MST3K possibilities (which I typically love), the only positives are the surfers' hilariously comatose stupidity and the boob to film length ratio.

The filmmakers should be black-balled from cinema for this ocean full of suck.  Either that or sent to Bollywood.  I'd only recommend this trash to people who enjoy the exquisite feeling of sinus migraines.",1226966400,,2623,5.2398081534772185

It has lots of silly surfer music with plenty of silly dialogue AND a silly looking crocodile that's fake from the word go.  But, this film still managed to hold my attention because it seemed to revel in the fact that it is a bad movie.

The story is pretty standard as far as creature features go.  Deep in the bluest of waters lies an ancient crocodile out for blood.  A film crew seeks out the best waters to do a little blood surfing, a.k.a. surfing with sharks.  Unfortunately for them, they decide to do a little surfing with a croc from Hades.  There's also a salty sea captain with a grudge against the ol' crocodile.  Bloodletting, explosions, and comedy ensue.

The actors in this flick seemed to be enjoying themselves quite a bit.  Kate Fischer, of ""Sirens"" fame, makes ""Blood Surf"" worth watching on her looks alone.  However, the rest of the cast does a pretty good job hamming it up on the screen, especially the surfer dudes.

As stated before, the surfer music is horrendous.  Dick Dale wouldn't find himself within ten yards of this ""surf"" guitar music.  But the stupidity of the music only makes the film that much better.

You really have to love the creature genre in order to understand why this film is what it is.  Many folks probably won't ""get it"" when so much of this flick turns out to be high on the cheese scale.  In my opinion, it's a funny little movie and deserves at least one look.

He transforms the movie from your garden variety sociopathic-crocodile psychodrama to an odyssey into the true ""blood surf"" we all must do when we explore our lineages.

Joel West (so smarmy in GLOBAL EFFECT) stands out as the ridiculously dudish Jeremy; with his blond spike and little goatee, he is your standard clownish clod, destined for croc consumption.  Duncan Regehr who once played Zorro many years back is no Robert Shaw (Jaws), but he is a crusty old captain and smirks admirably.  Katie Fleischer and Taryn Reif are lovely to look at, but Fleischer wins the acting honors; Reif is just not too believable.  Add a too handsome Dax Miller (Convent) as the studly Bog and you have your movie.  Blood surfing is not a sport I would consider, even if I could surf.  The idea is to surf ahead of a school of sharks and hope they don't eat you.  The script's switcheroo to the giant crocodile shows some spark of originality (duh?) and he does chomp up a few people.  The movie's climax is rushed and not all that exciting.  Still, BLOOD SURF has some beautiful scenery and should entertain those of us enamored with the giant sea creature anomaly.",1106092800,,1345,4.605042016806722

1421872,2,B00005BCP6,"""Blood Surf"" contributes yet another tired, clich ridden entry in the old monsters run amuck genre first created in the mid 1970s by ""Jaws."" A couple of years ago a movie came out called ""Deep Blue Sea,"" which if memory serves me well didn't do spectacular box office but did resuscitate this particular genre (as did ""Jurassic Park,"" but that's another story). In the intervening years studios bombarded video store patrons with an unceasing flow of low budget dreck involving sharks, octopi, alligators, crocodiles, eels, and whatever other big, mankind ravaging beasts a filmmaker could come up with. And guess what? Another shark type movie, called ""Open Water,"" will soon appear on a movie screen near you. If it's a success, or even if it isn't, we should probably expect even more movies like ""Blood Surf"" to appear in the near future. For the low budget, trash cinema fan, this is great news. There's nothing like howling at the ridiculous antics unfolding in car wrecks like ""Shark Attack 3"" and ""Blood Surf."" Believe it or not, this movie is worth watching despite its exasperating clichs and endless banalities. It's so funny that to not watch it is to miss out on something special.
""Blood Surf"" isn't so much a film title as it is a state of mind. According to the opening sequences of the picture, a couple of surfers named Bog (Dax Miller) and Jeremy (Joel West) plan on flying into an out of the way island to blood surf. This entails surfing amidst a whole mess of dangerous sharks. One small mistake and...well, you get the idea. Along for the ride are photographer Cecily (Katie Fischer) and her smarmy boyfriend Zack (Matt Borlenghi). Right from the start we discover Jeremy is the most annoying human being on the planet. He's one of those mouthy surfer yucks who talks like Sean Penn's character from ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"" without any of the charm associated with that actor's groundbreaking role. The plane lands safely, unfortunately, and the four quickly search about for a boat that will take them to a nearby cove where it is rumored that many hungry sharks swim about close to shore. With yawning predictability, our heroes meet up with the requisite grizzled tar, Dirks (Duncan Regehr), and his pretty young squeeze. The good captain of course tries to talk our team out of blood surfing, but eventually acquiesces when his girlfriend dances erotically for the surfers. Yeah, I know. Anyway, with directions firmly in hand, the quartet heads out with a bunch of natives and promptly runs into big problems.
Those darn sharks! How dare they intrude on our loveable characters! Ha ha, how wrong you are! The problem isn't the sharks but a huge salt water crocodile! What a coup the filmmakers pulled on us with this sudden shift in plot. I never saw this one coming. Neither do our protagonists as they stand helplessly by as the croc destroys the boat and dispatches the crew. Now our heroes can't get off the island, which is bad because that croc is fast! Salvation seems to lie close at hand when a bunch of mercenaries or pirates, whatever they are, stumble over our hapless characters and take them into custody. Once on the ship, only an amazing leap out of the water-the croc hangs in the air longer than Michael Jordan-saves the lead characters from the clutches of the nasty mercenaries/pirates. Then Dirks shows up (yawn again) and goes slightly overboard in his quest to destroy the crocodile. It turns out that the captain once piloted a ferry that fell to the savagery of the animal in question, and ever since that unfortunate incident he's been seeking revenge against the beast. I won't spoil the rest of it-you should know how it ends anyway-but the obligatory bloody encounters with the croc occur with frightening regularity. Who will live and who won't? Who cares?
""Blood Surf"" is amazingly underwhelming in its implications. Try this on for size: by the time the movie ended, I felt more genuine emotion for the crocodile than I did for the characters. Here's this old, exceptionally enormous creature, a veritable wonder of nature, destroyed by a surfer and a lady with cosmetic enhancements. What better way to show how the forces of modern superficiality have triumphed over the natural world? I've got a tip for the characters in the movie: DON'T GO TO AN ISLAND WHERE A GIANT CROC LIVES! Why is it that humans feel it incumbent to destroy everything in their path no matter where they are? Get outta there, you idiots, and don't come back! Besides, it's not as though any of these characters endear themselves to the audience. When the seedy Zack perishes after running out on his friends, the survivors witnessing the tragedy utter lines so callous, so disrespectful of life in general, that I almost turned the whole thing off right there despite not liking the deceased character.
The only reason to watch ""Blood Surf"" is to laugh at the ridiculousness of the whole thing. A bit of gore pops up toward the end, not badly done either, but it's far too late to save this mess by the time that happens. Katie Fischer is nice to look at, I guess, but the filmmakers fall down on the job here too since we never see much of her. Extras include a cheesy surf soundtrack, boring bonus footage, trailers for ""Blood Surf,"" ""Cut,"" and ""Attraction,"" and storyboards you can watch during certain chapters of the movie. The last feature was a first for me, but it's not impressive. When you watch ""Blood Surf,"" make sure to take off your watch and remove all timepieces from the room. Otherwise, you'll hurt your neck by constantly looking at them.",1090195200,2,5601,4.7693099897013385

1421874,2,B00005BCP6,"I simply cannot believe that there are filmmakers who believe they are doing a service by creating these films. The not-so-special fx are barely above Sid & Marty Krofft's level, and it is insulting to the public to expect anyone to have any sort of affinity for this. Yet it appears to be quite the exploding genre, these low-budget digital sea monster movies.
I try to look at these films as if the only thing holding them back from being great is the budget, and try not to blame any particular crew member for the deficiencies. But would this film have been superb with Star Wars-quality fx? Unlikely, since, in  this case, NOTHING could have saved a script like this. The infamous scene where their buddy rides the surfboard into the mouth of the croc--well, you don't actually ""see"" it happen--and all they can do is say ""that must suck""....what writer was thinking that an actual person would react so callously to a friend's violent demise? And the ""croc-teasing"" line: someone thought he was being clever, but when the characters are supposed to be scared out of their wits they probably wouldn't be cracking jokes. So here I have no choice but to point the finger at the writer as the biggest criminal.
Low budget also means low-paid actors, which means inexperienced actors, which means we must try to be kind to them. They need to eat, too. Taryn Reif--apparently a regular on the soap ""One Life to Live""--is, ultimately, the only reason I watch this. She is outrageously sexy IMHO, though I can understand she's not everyone's cup of tea. She bares herself way too briefly, but throughout she is very scantily clad and has a body that won't quit! I just can't figure what a soap starlet would be doing in a movie like this. It's a step backwards, one would think.
In the end, the high point of this film is the eye candy, and Taryn is my personal favorite, though the other girl, the one with the sex scene, is quite the looker as well.",1063756800,,1949,4.584527220630372

The plot, such as it is, involves an inconsiderate twerp (Matthew Borlenghi as Zack) who wants to film surfers and sharks together.  Hence the title.  With a little chum included.  This obnoxious cretin yaps his way through most of the film, leaving very little time for the mayhem to intrude.  Bits of nudity are tossed in as well as the suggestion of sex.  Out of desperation, they also include some would-be rapist pirates.  And then their guide (Duncan Regehr as John Dirks) goes Ahab on them as it turns out he has a longstanding grudge against this killer croc.  Harpoons away, the cretin encourages his girlfriend to jump in the water and film the capture of the killer croc.  Theres nothing as enticing as live bait.
