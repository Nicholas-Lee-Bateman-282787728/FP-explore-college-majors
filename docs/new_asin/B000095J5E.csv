1879628,3,B000095J5E,"This film is ok, but doesn't quite make you feel like you are watching a real documentary. The subtext of searching for video X makes it really seem even less believable.
I find it funny that people are padding the Amazon reviews with fake reviews of this picture like its really a documentary. Blair Witch wasn't that good to begin with, and that trick has been done so let's move on amateur film makers.
I'm frankly suprised the makers of the Charlie Starkweather film of 1993 with Tim Roth haven't sued over copyright infringement.",1073001600,4,534,4.691489361702128
1879629,1,B000095J5E,"I rented this thinking it was a real documentary. Cover box and synopis misleading. 5 minutes in, it was obvious. The actors are horrible sterotyping rural southerners. Phony accents and scripted dialouge comes through plenty. I guess this film is trying to go for a ""Blair Witch"" faux realism but it doesn't work. It is laughable attempt to create a ""reality gone mad"" fakeumentary.",1067817600,4,383,5.0
1879630,4,B000095J5E,This documentary really takes you to the south.  It's dark and eerie while still giving alot of information about the killings of Dwayne and Darla Jean.  This is a must see for true-crime junkies.  Some footage is included from Video X.  I'll be looking for a copy of that if and when it comes out.,1066089600,10,298,4.363636363636363
1879631,4,B000095J5E,"This is a really cool flick.  I really want to see Video X now.  The documentary is forboding and dark.  The 2 kids who are on the killing spree, Dwayne and Darla Jean, are just like people I've known in the south.  If you want to see something fun that will leave you guessing, give this a shot.  I'm going to try to find a copy of Video X on the internet or something and see how that is.",1066089600,8,390,3.8860759493670884
1879632,5,B000095J5E,"Spine Tingling.  Wow. That is all I can say.  This is a wonderful and sad journey.  To see such young people face such horror, throwing their lives away, yet feel their love for each other, fear, desperation.  This is truly a modern day Bonnie and Clyde!!",1064793600,9,255,4.478260869565218

7989679,2,B000095J5E,"This version of what took place in Nebraska in 1958 gives different names and places for the story. This is understandable but the movie is done as if a documentary and does not follow the story written so brilliantly by Jeff McArthur in ""Pro Bono"" which is excellent.",1358553600,,268,4.604166666666667
7989680,5,B000095J5E,"For may this was a love story gone wrong. The Cupid who mated Chuck & Caril Ann, should have turned in his wings and bow and arrow. This guy was hurting for a killing spree and that's what he did. His crime even made President Eisenhower mad as hell & personally wanted to see Starkweather get the chair, but got a presentative to stand in for him. 50 & Plus years later, bad things still goes on from 1959 to The Aurora Incident in July, 2012. In short Chuck Starkweather is in hell, but sees that he is still remembered & honored & he has the last laugh. Tim Roth should got an emmy protraying this dude. Wonder what would happen to Starkweather if he did Mi Lai? End of story.",1354492800,,679,4.190839694656488
7989681,1,B000095J5E,"without a doubt the worst movie/fake documentary ever filmed.  and the acting (I use that term very loosly) was horrendous!  I repeat what I said in the title, where did they find these people?!  I really don't believe there was a script for these people (if there was then that was just as awful as the acting, and the ""screenwriter"" needs to go back to film, no wait probably high school and start over) because the ""sister"" of the accused girl killer in her ""interview"" with the ""interviewer"" talked about she was doing this ""interview"" because she wanted to ""stop the explotation of her sister"" because these people that were ""explotation of my sister were making money and the money should go to me.""  yes folks I'm quoting her.  this was her answer to just about every question the ""interviewer"" asked her.  it reminded me of an eight-year-old who learned a new ""big"" word and wanted to use it as much as possible to TRY and sound intelligent.  instead it was obvious she really had no idea what the word means, because if she had she would realize how hypocritical her ""interview"" was.  hypocritical-now there's another ""big"" word for her to use, I wonder how long it will take her to figure it out...or maybe it's the ""screenwriter"" who needs the lesson...no way to tell really.

so if you're a prime member and can watch it for free (like I am) and want a good laugh this will suffice (there's another one, that should keep them busy for a while) but don't pay to watch this, you'll kick yourself if you do.",1342569600,5,1516,4.544117647058823
7989682,5,B000095J5E,"JUST ALOT OF GOSSIP AND TATTLE TAILS IS ALL ON THIS DVD, I WANTED THE MOVIE LIKE I SEEN ON T.V. THIS DVD SURE WAS INTERESTING BUT I FEEL I WASTE'D MONEY ON THI ORDER CAUSE IT WAS NOT THE MOVIE I WAS AFTER. I HAD A FEELING RIGHT FROM THE START THIS WASN'T WHAT I WANTED. WELL FOR OTHER PEOPLE 'GO ON ORDER IT YA MIGHT LIKE IT. SEE FER YA SELF. THANKS FOR READING MY SAY SO HERE.",1137628800,2,377,3.725
7989683,3,B000095J5E,"Obviously, this is not my type of movie fare, but it looked interesting in a mysterious way, and it does not disappoint.  From the chilling 911 calls in the opening seconds, to the unfolding of bizarre interviews, this documentary is really a psychological mystery that tries to explain why two ""good"" young people went on a murder spree.  The documentary ends up searching for the home movie made by the criminals, ""Video X: Evidence.""  ""Video X: Evidence"" I'm sure is too violent for me to want to view, but one does wonder what is on the tape.  Although I feel sorry for the two young killers, their deeds are reprehensible.  It is a sad commentary on the bleaker aspects of our children and society, and shows why a healthy family unit is truly the most important institution we have.  Beware of the graphic crime photos, which might be prohibitive for some viewers.",1126310400,11,870,4.690789473684211
7989684,5,B000095J5E,"My angry children of the night, you will want to join with them, in this movie.  These two innocents, Dwayne and Darla Jean, are ripe for nightcrawling.  For the living: Set aside your daytime ways and take up their rage.  Kill as one.  For the undead: Embrace them as our own, for they kill with their hearts only.  I want to hold them in the Dracule, and turn them myself.  The time for bloodletting is now.  Soil the day with your death flight, my innocents.  Fly...",1125878400,7,469,4.372093023255814
7989685,4,B000095J5E,"dudes, let's be real, it's like ""murder in the... whatever..."" (is that a title, or the definition of a sponge?)  is like a warmup for the real movie.  checked out the movie that THIS movie is supposd to be searchin for -- ""video x: evidence"" -- was like, now i get it, and it wet my drawers.  ""video x..."" is better than Kalifornia... looks realler than **ck.  i respect low budgt filmmaking, like when dudes get together with a camera, and go, let's do something creative... okay, Kubrick had to start somewhere... but ""video x: evidence"" did creep my sh** out.  had a seriel killer in my nighberhood once -- word.  ""murder in... sponge..."" seems like its a followup fake-doc to fill gaps.  indy awake at 5am.  j.",1124582400,8,715,4.53125
7989686,1,B000095J5E,"I checked this out of the library thinking it was a true case, before I got a chance to watch it a friend of mine who reads every true crime book he can get his hands on told me it was a fake. Nevertheless I figured it might at least be entertaining...wrong again! It has all of the excitment of watching a slideshow of someone's family vacation. I could only tolerate 30 minutes before I turned it off. I can only assume that the people that wrote positive reviews are friends of the filmaker.  I gave this one star because it wouldn't allow me to give it none.",1105488000,7,562,4.203703703703703
7989687,1,B000095J5E,this video really sucked!! i tried to convince myself it was okay but found myself in a greater and greater struggle to keep watching. It was hard to get through and the only thing i think that really kept me watching it was to try not to feel like i wasted 3 bucks on the internet. It just seemed fake and like a real waste of time!!!,1100736000,4,335,4.014925373134329
7989688,1,B000095J5E,"This was simply a waste of time.  A Blair Witch rip-off I suspect, this effort was from the start obviously a fake.  The movie is classified as a documentary.  It is not.
The end, the clip of the mythical video x, makes it clear that this is just some lame attempt to emulate BW.  I guess if you want to waste a few hours this is a good place....
