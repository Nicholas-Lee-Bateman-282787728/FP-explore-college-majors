8605804,4,B00EIPKK1W,"This is the ""complete"" animated series. All the stories. I first saw the ""movie"" on an international flight--with Japanese actors portraying the Romans. This is not it, but it's fun (and more phallic).",1496793600,2,201,5.121212121212121
8605805,5,B00EIPKK1W,"When I first saw the picture of the DVD, I was intrigued right away and after viewing this hilarious show, I can say it was quite a find. This is a fairly short show you can finish in an evening.  Plot is simple, a struggling architect in Rome named  Lucius is having some problems with his business, until he finds a secret way to make it big. He discovers a portal in a bathhouse underwater to the future!  He only has a short amount of time wherever he travels, but it's just enough to study the inventions of the modern world. He uses his newly found discovers to get famous!  Each ep is only 10-14 min give or take and the animation is quite limited. But I think the style suits the show.  The humor ranges from deadpan dialogue to in your face. In terms of a rating, probably 15 plus for adult situations and the occasional brief nudity.
The DVD itself is barebones with either a play all or ep select in the menu, nothing else. Japanese audio just so you know.
One thing that was weird to me is that you could skip chapters within the ep, but not skip to the next ep without fast forwarding through the end credits. Did not ruin anything, jus thought I'd point it out.
So if you're looking for something a little different in the anime section, I'd say check it out.",1384646400,7,1273,4.265560165975104
