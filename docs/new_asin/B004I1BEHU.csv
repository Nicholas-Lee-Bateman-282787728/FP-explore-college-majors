4381547,4,B004I1BEHU,"As a kid, I remember the Amos and Andy Show as the one we never  missed. I gave it four stars because I like it even though the video quality is poor. It still looks as good as it did on our old TV way back in the fifties. The comedy writing for this series was every bit as good as any sitcom writing of the day, and the casting seems perfect to me.

The packaging is less than it could be in that all the discs are stacked on one post and you must unscrew a fastener and sort through the discs by number and then refer to the
back of the case for the episode list to find which disc the episode you want is on. Then, since there are no menus you have count chapter stops to find a particular episode.

Well, enough about the negatives.
I think It is great to be able to watch a show that brings back so many good memories and this set is certainly worth the price to me.",1306886400,32,872,3.8876404494382024
4381548,3,B004I1BEHU,"The set of dvds had some episodes with little or no sound or blaring sound with white noise. I believe that the master from which these dvds were made most likely from VHS Tapes . I was dissatified the DVD quality which is not even equal to VHS, the contrast was jacked-up to high causing the quality and details to be down graded and sometime pixilated and grainy at times. I do not blame amazon for any reason related to this problem.  I will most likely not return this American Historical classic set of DVD's as this media is very hard to obtain regardless of the quality (due to the AFLCIO issues). I just wish because the times have changed(on the why we think), that the AFLCIO would lift the band on this show so that the studio owners Paramount Home Entertainment/ CBS DVD would be able to remaster/ convert the TV series into a good DVD and or Blu-Ray HD Disks, which I would then buy and discard the one's I have now.",1306195200,5,929,4.339080459770115

Story lines are excellent -- better than you'll find on current TV and it won't bother you to have your children watch with you.  (Now THAT'S a change!)  Plus the characters are really characters -- funny and appealing.  If you know the history of Amos 'n' Andy, you'll understand why they are bringing the show back on DVDs.

This episode is repeated twice on Volume 2. I'm a little disappointed. I can only imagine how many more episodes will be repeated as I go along. Such as Kingfish trying to swindle Andy into buying a lot that has oil on it. Actually there were 78 episodes recorded, not 74 as advertised on the box set. In addition there could be less than 74 with so many repeated episodes that I discovered while watching just the 2 disc so far. I will post more as I go along.",1494806400,5,598,4.300884955752212

4381609,4,B004I1BEHU,I was in elementary school in the 1950s. TV shows were in black and white. Many good comedy shows. One of my favorites was Amos and Andy. The character Kingfish was so funny. Good down to earth humor.,1481068800,5,200,4.2894736842105265

4381611,4,B004I1BEHU,"DVD's arrived on time and the shows were really funny.  The only reason that I didn't give 5 stars is because the sound and/or picture quality wasn't very good on some of the shows.  I understand that when these shows were made in the 1940's and 1950's, they had not refined turning radio shows into television shows, so the quality would be lacking.  I will share these treasures with my family and friends in our home and recommend that they buy the complete set like I bought.  I really don't think that Amos and Andy Shows were making fun of African American people because they clearly show how gullible some people can be with Andy, how scheming George was for money without working, and how Amos and Ruby were the moral compass of their friends and that is an important lesson for everyone, wheather they or African American or Caucasion or Asian or Native American.",1475884800,6,873,4.612903225806452

4381617,5,B004I1BEHU,"This is a hilarious series with over 70 episodes and over 2100 minutes of viewing. These are some phenomenal actors. They've developed knee-slapping characters with humorous attributes.

As a child I used to watch these on TV and this series inspires nostalgia. Unfortunately, some liberal activists protested this series back in the 60s, but I feel the Amos 'n Andy Show was anything but racist. It was just pure humor and, would be so, regardless of the race of these actors. To call this show racist would be akin to calling Sanford and Son racist - it's simply not so, but the protestors had to find something to protest - this show was sacrificed and outstanding Black actors lost their jobs.

But apart from the politics of this show, I have to say that it ranks with the best series ever shown on TV. Also, despite the age of these films, due to digital remastering, they appear quite visually pleasant.

4381679,5,B004I1BEHU,Always fun to see the old comedies.  This was a trip into nostalgiaville when you didn't need sex mentioned to be funny.,1363392000,,120,4.454545454545454
4381680,5,B004I1BEHU,Remembered this series from my early teenage years before it was taken off TV. Great acting and some seriously funny antics by the cast of characters. Always enjoyed them some 50 years ago and it is great to see them over and over again today. I was not as concerned about the video quality as I was totally aware of just how old the original source material was to begin with.,1361145600,,377,4.323943661971831
4381681,5,B004I1BEHU,"What a find! Some of the episodes are in better condition than others due to age and storage issues over the years, but they're great to see just the same. I remember sneaking downstairs as a child, and watching them from behind an oversized armchair after I was supposed to be in bed!",1357516800,,285,4.39622641509434
4381682,4,B004I1BEHU,i bought the amos and andy show box set it said all the shows were digitally restored they are not some of the dvds the picture is dark  the sound track is not that good but all in all they are pertty good i like this show very much  i just hope that someday the amos and andy show will be restored the way it should be.cbs who owns the show should get with it.,1355443200,4,361,3.8
4381683,5,B004I1BEHU,Without a doubt these shows were some of the funniest ever produced in tv history to date. The sad part is that the masters or first generation copies do exist (but where are they)because every time I've seen an excerpt from a show on a documentary they are near perfect quality.  This makes them nuch more enjoyable to watch. While this particular collection boasts digital restoration there are many episodes that are of poor quality.  However some are good quailty and many fall in between.  For the price though you are not being cheated.  The bottom line is that once you start watching these great actors you can't stop laughing. Think of a sitcom today that you can say that about.  Today they are not funny and only try to get laughs with crude humor.  I would hope that one day the vault where these shows are is opened and a true restoration is completed.,1353456000,2,865,4.548387096774194
4381684,5,B004I1BEHU,"There could be a college course covering the history of Amos 'n Andy and it's place in American TV of the Fifties. It is sometimes awkward watching these shows but the writing and acting are so funny and sweet one forgets how politically incorrect it is. Yes. Pre-Civil Rights America was dreadful but these gems of comic skits should not be hidden. Mostly the characters are no more self-demeaning than Lucille Ball, Gomer Pyle or the Clampetts. This is a classic.",1329523200,2,465,4.753086419753086
4381685,4,B004I1BEHU,"Great to finally see this 50's show again. Good audio, b & w video that is probably no worse than the original broadcast quality on a 12"" Crosley TV.

Surprisingly, my daughter and son-in-law (early forties) enjoyed Amos 'n Andy as much as I do.

This was a perfect Birthday Gift, as 9/10 gifts I get are returned. This one is a Keeper.",1326412800,10,336,4.317460317460317
4381686,3,B004I1BEHU,Love the comedy! But what happened at the end of the two parter where Sapphire's mother was engaged to get married? The end of Part Two just cut off and the closing song played for a choppy few seconds and that was the end of the DVD.  Very disappointing to watch both episodes and not knowing how it ends.,1319500800,15,306,4.186440677966102
4381687,5,B004I1BEHU,"Nobody makes good comedy anymore.  I adore how ""back in the day"" comedy was clean and funny.  I absolutely love Amos and Andy.  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.",1317945600,14,176,4.612903225806452
4381688,1,B004I1BEHU,"I was very disappointed in the quality of this product. DVD is very grainy and thus unpleasant to watch. Purchasers should be warned in advance for lowered expectations.  Shows are funny and very entertaining but the quality of the DVD takes away from the enjoyment. I will be very cautious about purchasing, in the future,  DVDs from old TV shows that have been digitally restored. I assume the technology has not been perfected to enhance the quality of such shows for 21st century viewing.",1309996800,27,492,4.845238095238095

8429853,5,B004I1BEHU,"I am very happy with this collection. I am a long time fan and have graduated from the VHS tapes sold a few years ago of this material. It is true that some of the video, more so than the audio, is below par.  Syndication was pulled in 1966 and the films fell into some kind of legal limbo. The films used to make these DVDs and the VHS tapes I have were not well preserved. Whether CBS has pristine copies, I don't know, but it seems unlikely since it has never offered Amos and Andy in home video formats. If you love Amos and Andy as I do, get this set. Despite the relatively poor quality, it is much better than the VHS tapes. The entertainment value of this material is worth this small negative.",1499817600,3,702,4.161764705882353
