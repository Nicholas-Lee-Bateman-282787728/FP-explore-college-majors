This DVD is a must for the newcommer as well as the advanced artist for inspiration.",1316044800,3,307,4.482142857142857
7795080,5,0982183321,"This video is down to eart and fun to watch. Tha video shows tool making techniques and subtle differences in style that will give a different perspective to advanced metalsmiths and show a well rounded instructiona format  for the typical metalsmith with beginning to moderate skill levels, wishing  to explore chasing and repousse. It is quite lengthy, over four hours of video, and is pleasing to watch. It will be added to my library of scores of jewelry books, this was my first DVD format jewelry media purchase. It is worth the price for the information provided. No regrets.",1299888000,11,582,4.8686868686868685
