8075054,4,B000A6QAFI,"This is a good work out,  the clothing styles and music are very1990's but the work out is fun and challenging.
Lucky me I found the Ramp that they use in this video at a thrift store.",1396828800,,184,3.972972972972973
8075055,4,B000A6QAFI,I bought this so that I could have more workouts to use my ramp.  I like these very well. Nice addition to Leslie Sansome Ramp Video's,1368921600,,134,4.153846153846154

8075057,5,B000A6QAFI,"I think this is great for beginners and intermediate to use a ramp. I am using a step instead and it works for me. I am used to the Leslie Sansone walking videos and I'm trying this for a change. It is a little bit faster pace, but great!",1356825600,,238,3.877551020408163
8075058,2,B000A6QAFI,"The cute hats stay on their heads during this routine that is simple and not Cardio intensive.  While Gin walks you through the Jazz routine moves, it is not as advertised with ""Super Cardio"".  I didn't break a sweat on this one.",1351123200,,229,4.428571428571429

Leslie Sansone</a>&nbsp;because the instructor exercised your arms much more frequently and in greater strength moves. My only criticism would be that the instructor did not more effectively demonstrate a few of the moves on this DVD namely the one she calls the ""hourglass"". Nonetheless I would strongly recommend this DVD for anyone who still has a ramp in their possession and would like to use it for exercise.",1284768000,5,1008,7.5508474576271185
