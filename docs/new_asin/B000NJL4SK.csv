2769446,4,B000NJL4SK,"This 2-disc set is a compilation of some of the best moments from the Tonight Show.  Johnny Carson was to talk shows as bacon is to a turkey sandwich; he made a good thing great.

2769447,5,B000NJL4SK,"This 2 DVD set includes 4 programs previously available on 4 individual DVDs.  It is a great set to get a real feel for Johnny's 30 years on television.  Anyone who was a fan loved it when Johnny would interact with his strange animal guests, and Animal Hijinx has some of the best appearances by many furry friends.  Kids especially like this one.  Tonight Show Memories features short highlights of the most famous moments from the the 30 year history of the show.  Return to Studio One is a really interesting full episode from the late 60's - when guests would show up unannounced. Johnny apparently kept a full-stocked bar back stage, and Dean Martin and Bob Hope showed up to have a few drinks and visit unexpectedly.  It is terrific to watch television that is not entirely planned and scripted.  And the Final Show is a classic in television history.  For fans who want more content, I would still advise buying&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ultimate-Johnny-Carson-Collection-His-Favorite-Moments-from-The-Tonight-Show-Vols-1-3-1962-1992/dp/B000068WS7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ultimate Johnny Carson Collection - His Favorite Moments from The Tonight Show (Vols. 1-3) (1962-1992)</a>over this one, as it has many more hours of content, and then buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Johnny-Carson-The-Tonight-Show-Return-to-Studio-One-3-6-69/dp/B00006IIP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Johnny Carson - The Tonight Show: Return to Studio One, 3/6/69</a>as a single disc, but for the price this is a great collection.",1181174400,22,1616,6.3807339449541285
2769448,5,B000NJL4SK,Been looking for a really good collection for several years. Most were of poor quality. NOT this one! I am thrilled to have finally found a comprehensive collection that not only brings back the best of Johnny but also great quality. I really like the format of cutting out the commercials and trimming the fat from each episodes to thirty minutes each. I just love this set and recommend it to any J. C. fans.,1431216000,4,410,4.48
2769449,5,B000NJL4SK,I grew up watching Jonny Carsion. These DVD's bring back these memories. Each DVD is differant and each hold 4 programs. All of the commercials are cut out so only the meat of the program is shown. AMAZON even sells a bigger package of these and if they don't have duplicates of the 14 programs that I now have I'm going to buy them also.,1426118400,2,338,4.2153846153846155

2769453,5,B000NJL4SK,Arrived quickly and as promised.,1409443200,,32,5.6
2769454,4,B000NJL4SK,"I bought this for my dad because he watched Johnny Carson back in the day. I checked it out just out of curiosity. I find it interesting that back then they used to drink and smoke on stage. I suppose they might still drink however from what I've seen on Jay Leno (which is now Jimmy Fallon I believe) it's hidden and made to look like coffee or water. You just can't tell anymore. They didn't hide any of it back then, though. Johnny definitely had a knack for hosting and it shows in this. Some very funny highlights and skits. I think most potential buyers won't need to read a review to buy this.",1395187200,,600,4.226086956521739
2769455,4,B000NJL4SK,We watched this dvd with friends and laughed at the old Tonight Show with Carson. The quality was good and I have no complaints about this purchase.,1376524800,,148,4.518518518518518
2769456,5,B000NJL4SK,Everyone loves Johnny Carson.  He was the greatest.  Have you ever seen the egg trick done with Dom Delouise?  It is awesome.  Everyone should see it.  Enjoy.,1359072000,,158,4.703703703703703
2769457,5,B000NJL4SK,"It's only a 2 disc set and a little over 2 1/2 hours but it's great anyway. If you want a small sample of how funny the guy was, this is the DVD for you. The interaction with guests, kids and animals are laugh out loud funny. Loved it and would be recommend it.",1340668800,,261,3.8518518518518516
2769461,5,B000NJL4SK,"Sent this along with other DVDs for my Dad. He has moderate Altzheimers and does not watch much TV. However, he likes some of these old shows. So far, he likes these Johnny Carson clips, Dean Martin and Jack Benny the best.",1294617600,,223,4.333333333333333
2769462,2,B000NJL4SK,"This collection consists of 2 CDS.
There are only two episodes (shows) on each CD
of about 30 min ea.
So the entire package consists of about 2 hours of material.
Some of the audio/video quality is faily low grade.
There doesn't seem to be any Re-mastering sone to clean up
the original material",1247616000,,295,4.481481481481482
2769463,2,B000NJL4SK,"This DVD set way okay, but short length for the price paid.  It also says it has moments from his last show, but does not.  I was disappointed overall.",1236988800,2,151,4.172413793103448
2769464,5,B000NJL4SK,"This is Johnny Carson at his best.  It brings back fond memories of the hours I laughed at his wit, his humor, his craziness --  all done within healthy and sane boundaries of respect for his audiences.",1205020800,,202,4.4324324324324325
2769465,5,B000NJL4SK,"I have always loved the Johnny Carson brand of humor.  Who else has come up with so many extra persona's, such as the Great Carmak.  This set of 2 DVD's was a good mix of some of his funniest shows.

No one since has measured up to his sharp wit and instant comeback's.  My husband and I will play this many times.  Our children were children when Johnny was around and I think they will appreciate his humor more now that they are adults and have children of their own.",1203638400,,470,4.177777777777778
2769466,3,B000NJL4SK,Beautiful picture quality but there wasn't enough material on these discs to warrant full purchase price. One only had less than 45 minutes of highlights. Good thing this was on a half price sale when i purchased it.,1191628800,5,216,4.7105263157894735
2769467,4,B000NJL4SK,"While this CD wasn't as good as ""Papa's got a Brand New Baghdad"" or ""Between Irag and a Hard Place"", it was still very enjoyable.",1186963200,,129,4.2
2769468,5,B000NJL4SK,I ORDERED THIS FOR MY FATHER FOR FATHER'S DAY AND GOT ONE FOR MYSELF TOO.  WHAT A HOOT!!  I WATCHED BOTH DISCS AND COULDN'T WAIT TO GIVE MY DAD HIS COPY.  WE LAUGHED OUT LOUD AND WISH JOHNNY WAS STILL AROUND TO ENTERTAIN US.  WHAT A GREAT COMEDIAN. WHAT TIMING AND PERSONALITY.  IT SHOWED THAT HE LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF BEING ON STAGE.  I RECOMMEND THIS DVD TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO GO BACK IN TIME AND ENJOY THE COMEDY OF THIS GENIUS.,1184544000,8,432,4.144578313253012
2769469,5,B000NJL4SK,"If you enjoyed watching Johnny Carson then this would be a good set to own.  It's a great alternative to the longer box sets because it only shows the most memorable moments from the Tonight Show in only about two hours.  I enjoyed being able to see the comedy duo of Johnny and Ed McMahon again, along with the final episode.  I was pleased, but not surprised, to see that clips from shows when Johnny had animals on the set.  They were always the most candid and entertaining.",1181260800,11,478,4.3977272727272725
2769470,5,B000NJL4SK,"This DVD set is all my favorite Johnny Carson shows pulled into one. Return to Studio One with Bob Hope and Dean Martin is truly a milestone in comedy, in my opinion. I I'm glad that I was able to make it a part of my collection.",1181260800,6,229,3.893617021276596

8178232,4,B000NJL4SK,"The shows were interesting, funny, and certainly nostalgic but I think the ""Best of..."" series would have been better. We are half way through viewing the set and there's very little from the early years and not much of the classic moments so far. Still, it is fun to watch and wonder if we ever that young.",1455580800,,307,4.4035087719298245
8178233,4,B000NJL4SK,"This collection is a hodgepodge of four shows that were originally released on individual VHS tapes/DVDs.  I purchased it primarily for the first title on disc two, Return to Studio One, which is apparently all that remains of the infamous show from March 6, 1969, which featured Bob Hope, Dean Martin, and George Gobel.  It runs about 40 minutes long, much shorter than the original 90 minutes, so there is quite a bit missing.  (Most shows from the 1960s were wiped and are lost forever, unfortunately.)  However, it is very enjoyable and includes the complete segment of craziness between Hope, Martin, and Gobel.  Other than that, it includes Johnnys monologue, a drum segment with Buddy Rich, a partial interview with Laugh-Ins Judy Carne (which ends abruptly and returns with Hope on the couch and Johnny in different clothing  obviously a big missing chunk there), and a brief bit with Carol Wayne and Robert Wagner at the end.

The other three shows are entertaining, but not phenomenal.  Disc one includes two clip shows.  The first, Animal Hijinks, includes short clips with animal guests, which are pretty funny.  The second, Tonight Show Memories, is various clips from throughout the years at break-neck speed.  It almost feels like you're watching an infomercial.  There are other clip collections which are better, in my opinion.  Both of these shows run for about half an hour.

The second show on disc two is The Final Show.  This is not the famous one where Bette Midler sings (which was from the next-to-last day).  It is mostly a clip show looking back through Johnnys 30-year tenure.  It is quite funny, but I suspect it has been edited somewhat.

Overall, I recommend this mainly for the rare Return to Studio One show.  If you want to really see Johnny in action, I recommend both the Vault Series and Featured Guest DVDs, which feature complete shows, including commercials.",1454544000,,1898,4.911949685534591

8178236,5,B000NJL4SK,King of late night is a five star show. Worth every dollar I paid for it. Quality of picture and sound excellent.,1443052800,3,113,4.181818181818182
