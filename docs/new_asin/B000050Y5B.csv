7929174,2,B000050Y5B,"""The Most Astounding Structures"" presents a number of record-holding buildings from around the world; unfortunately, the categories are overlapping and confusing and it is difficult to discern a train of thought.

Viewers learn that Romans invented concrete, and an 1885 ten-story building in Chicago broke the limit of masonry construction.  The Empire State Building is 102 floors, and held the title of world's tallest for 40 years.

The world's tallest title now is held by the Petronas Towers according to the film; however, Wikipedia says it is now held by the Taipei 101.  (Categories and associated rules go back and forth according to whether antennae or spires top the building, number of floors devoted to office-work, etc.)

The Eiffel Tower is over 100 stories high, used as a radio and TV communications tower, and built in 1899.  The world's tallest structure, according to the film, is Canada's CN Tower - 1,815 feet tall.  However, in 2007 a tower in Dubai reached 2,302 feet, and is still rising.

The largest pyramid is not in Egypt, but the White Pyramid of China - twice the height of the tallest pyramid and 20X its volume.

Then its off to a 1700 B.C. underground city in Turkey with 8 levels discovered so far, followed by the Greenbrier Hotel in West Virginia, and the Winchester House in San Jose, CA. - built in an attempt to assuage the ghosts of Winchester rifle victims.",1224720000,,1400,4.848739495798319
