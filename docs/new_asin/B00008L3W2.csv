1850970,5,B00008L3W2,"Remastered and restored in full quality with an enhanced 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound Track, this debut album from Kirk Franklin & The Family was re-recorded from its original 1992 version. Once again recorded at the Grace Temple S.D.A. Church in Fort Worth, TX, there are some distinctions between the first recording and this version. This recording was presented with more depth and clarity. I watched this video and was more than entertained. Having watched many of Kirk's most memorable and treasured performances, it just took me through a journey. What more can you say about Kirk Franklin? 16 years in the industry literally proves that there was [and still is] a special gift inside of him, The Family, 1NC, God's Property and all of the other groups that formed the Nu Nation. Every song starting with ""He's Able"" and ending with the stylishly ethnic incorporations of Funk, R&B, & Hip-Hop in ""He Can Handle It"" just re-introduced me to the initial direction Kirk Franklin was headed in. This experience was needed to spawn a new generation and a new way to worship, praise, and speak the word through song. As a footnote, this was also the first video that exposed some of Tyler Perry's Madea roster, which included Lakeisha Grandy, who sang lead on ""Silver & Gold,"" David Mann, (Mr. Brown) his wife, Tamela Mann, bassist Jerome Allen and percussionist Erick J. Morgan. What a way to begin a stellar career!!! I loved all 80 minutes of this presentation. Sometimes you have to look back in order to see ahead!!!",1137628800,11,1518,4.842307692307692
