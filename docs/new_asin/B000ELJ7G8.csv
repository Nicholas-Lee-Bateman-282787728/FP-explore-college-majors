8110937,4,B000ELJ7G8,"Pretty good collection of low budget horror but if you're looking for great special effects or great story plots,this is not the collection you want to have. It does have some gruesome scenes in them and some of them have some good horror humor. Worth $10.00 just to get some violent bloody scenes and a few good laughs.

8110938,5,B000ELJ7G8,"A rather bland collection of marginal cinematic efforts is saved by the modern underground classic: Catholic Ghoulgirls.  This film had sadly been out of print for several years now and makes its triumphant return to dvd.  Catholic Ghoulgirls is an incredible piece of DIY film making that introduced the world to the acting talents of the alluring Vanessa Kessinger.

  Unfortunately it is her one, and only starring role.  Miss Kessinger refuses to compromise her artistic vision, and has rejected dozens of offers to star in major motion pictures, preferring to wait for the chance to continue playing Becky.  Interviewed by The New York Times in 2003, she stated that she continues to hold out hope that the oft-rumored Catholic Ghoulgirls 2: The Reckoning  will be made, so that we can finally learn more of Becky and her struggles against the undead.",1229817600,,856,5.0212765957446805

8110940,2,B000ELJ7G8,"MAXIM MEDIA's ""Pendulum Pictures"" horror films are distributed exclusively by MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT. These movies are a throwback to the early '60s type of drive-in theater gorefests that were once popular with teens. If you're looking for big-budget state of the art special effects and top rank actors this series may not be right for you. Murder, mayhem and madness aficionados will not be disappointed by this little collection of killer babes, however.

More wicked, wanton, witchy women (including barely legal lesbian vampires) can be found on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BRUTAL-BLOODSUCKERS-6-MOVIE-PACK/dp/B000H5U66Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BRUTAL BLOODSUCKERS 6 MOVIE PACK</a>.

8110941,5,B000ELJ7G8,"Great collection of totally indie low budget horror. And we're talking LOW budget. Get out the handycam and call your cousins to be in a movie budget but alot of fun to watch. I laughed until I cried. My fav? ""Cutting Room"". Lots of little nods to past horror flicks as well as a cameo from the King of low budget indie himself...Mr. Lloyd Kauffman. The more I watch this one, the more I love it. Definitely will become a cult classic.",1141689600,14,435,4.317073170731708
