4495871,1,B004XKVP7K,"TCM has been putting out these four-bys of different actresses and actors.  I liked getting some of these old classics that way.  I already own Doris Day for instances.  So with great anticipation I purchased this one.  I checked the box to make sure the films were presented in their original aspect ratio.  The box said yes they are.  Well, surpise, surprise Butterfied 8 is modified to fit my screen (which is a HD 62 widescreen.)  So, here I have a CinemaScope movie in the dreaded Pan & Scan.  I wrote TCM about it and their reply was: ""You didn't buy it from us, so too bad.""  In other words unless you buy it directly from TCM they do not stand behind their products.  It is not like Wall-Mart put the wrong DVD in the box.

So, be careful - DON'T BUY THIS SET!!!

I'm now worried about any other TCM products since they have no customer service.",1344384000,33,853,4.329113924050633
4495872,1,B004XKVP7K,"Sorry, i can't raise any enthusiasm for this rush release, which is merely a re-hash of Taylor titles already freely available, individually and in collections such as the Taylor/Burton release, and also the Tennessee Williams collection. Although BUtterfield 8 is out-of-print, it is still available with a bit of searching. The Taylor fans will already own these on dvd. For years i have been raising the point that her 50s MGM titles such as Conspirator, The Girl who had Everything, Rhapsody, Beau Brummell, The Last Time I Saw Paris, and especially Raintree County were not available on dvd from Warners, who unfortunately now own these titles. Sure, some of these are now available, UNREMASTERED, on warner archive, which is an insult to Taylor. The Last Time I Saw Paris, in the public domain, has been issued by just about everyone except warners! Come on you guys at warners, get off your collective butts, and do something about these titles, and give them the release they deserve. Also, at the moment, there isn't a single Taylor title available on blu-ray. Hopefully the outpouring of affection following Taylor's death will stir someone at warners to action, or maybe they could be persuaded to give up their rights to these movies, and allow someone else to do them justice, as their lack of interest is appalling.",1304467200,23,1329,4.9641255605381165
4495873,4,B004XKVP7K,"Still,not the best of her films, of course ""cat on a hot tin roof"" is,m not even that crazy about it.
it would have nicer having ""Butterfeild 8""  ""Cat on a hot tin roof""  ""father of the bride"" and ""A place in the sun""",1304380800,,217,3.909090909090909
4495874,5,B004XKVP7K,"It didn't take too long after Elizabeth Taylor's passing for TCM to release a set in her honour, as part of the ""TCM Greatest Classic Films"" series, their special programme designed to bring classic movies to the masses in budget-friendly sets.

The four films included in this Elizabeth Taylor-themed collection do create an effective overview of Taylor's career path at MGM, from her early ingenue roles to the Academy Award-winning BUTTERFIELD 8, and onward to her collaborations with Richard Burton.

1950's FATHER OF THE BRIDE is the oldest film in the set.  In the very first version of the popular comedy, Taylor is Kay Banks, who surprises her family when she announces plans to get married; Spencer Tracy is her harried father who foots the bills (and most of the stress) that will come along with the big day.  Special Features: vintage newsreels ""Wedding Bells for Movie Star Elizabeth Taylor"" and ""President Truman meets ""Father of the Bride"""", behind the scenes notes, cast & crew, and the trailer.

CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF sees Elizabeth cast as Maggie Pollitt, driven to the brink by her estranged husband Brick (Paul Newman) during his father's annual birthday celebrations.  The original Tennessee Williams play was significantly watered-down for the screen, omitting the crucial homosexual undertones of Brick's relationship with a highschool friend.  Although Taylor is effective as Maggie, she'd fare much better in ""Suddenly Last Summer"", another Tennessee Williams piece, filmed shortly after this.  Special Features: ""Playing Cat and Mouse"" featurette, and audio commentary with Taylor biographer Donald Spoto.

Elizabeth Taylor always professed to despise BUTTERFIELD 8, though ironically it's the film for which she received her first Academy Award.  In what's little more than glossy soap opera, Taylor is Gloria, a model (ie: high-class hooker) who gets much more than she bargained for when she falls in love with a married man (Laurence Harvey).  Taylor's husband at the time, Eddie Fisher, co-stars in a supporting role; Dina Merrill is Harvey's icy Wasp wife.  Special Features: cast notes, and the trailer.

Finally in THE SANDPIPER, Taylor co-stars with her husband Richard Burton, in a decidedly modern adult love story, set to the lilting theme ""The Shadow of Your Smile"" and shot at breathtaking Big Sur locations.  Taylor is Laura Reynolds, a free-spirited Bohemian artist who falls in love with a man of the cloth (Burton).  Special Features: vintage featurettes ""A Statue for ""The Sandpiper"""" and ""The Big Sur"".

This set will be an essential purchase for Elizabeth Taylor fans.  And those who missed out on the now out-of-print standalone DVD release of BUTTERFIELD 8 will appreciate the movie coming back into print.",1303948800,11,2755,5.225
4495875,4,B004XKVP7K,"It's fairly common knowledge among movie buffs that Elizabeth's off screen life often mirrored what was going on in her latest film, and this four film's included in this set exemplifies that. In FATHER OF THE BRIDE we get Taylor as a bride as she was simultaneously walking down the aisle for the first time in real life. CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF and BUTTERFIELD 8 (and the original marketing behind both) display Elizabeth's sizzling sexuality onscreen as the Eddie-Debbie-Liz triangle played out in the headlines, while THE SANDPIPER the Burtons, the two most famous adulterers of the 1960s have an affair onscreen. This would make for a decent introduction to the career of the late Elizabeth Taylor, or for the casual fan. If you already own these films on DVD, this release offers no new extras, and therefore there is no incentive to buy this set. (Hopefully we'll see more unreleased Elizabeth Taylor films on DVD and especially Blu-ray in the coming months.)

THE FILMS:
In FATHER OF THE BRIDE (1950) dewy ingenue Elizabeth plays the daughter of Spencer Tracy in this classic comedy about the ups and downs of planning a wedding. Costume designer Helen Rose, who designed Taylor's gown in the film would go on to design her gown for the Hilton nuptials.

Elizabeth sizzles in CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF (1958) as the wife of Paul Newman, whose character refuses to love her. The plot is confusing due to strict censorship in place at the time (in the play Newman's character is a homosexual), however the overwhelming beauty of Taylor and Newman, both at their peak, distracts from this flaw. The role of Maggie the Cat garnered Elizabeth her second Oscar nomination for Best Actress.

Bonus: Commentary by Biographer/Film Historian Donald Spoto * Featurette Cat on a Hot Tin Roof: Playing Cat and Mouse * Theatrical Trailer * Languages: English & Franais * Subtitles: English, Franais & Espaol

BUTTERFIELD 8 (1960) sees Elizabeth as a high class call girl and part-time dress model who gets tangled up with a wealthy, reckless character played by Laurence Harvey. Elizabeth finally received the Best Actress Oscar for this one, although she (and most critics) attributed it to her having nearly died in London while making 'Cleopatra' (1963), as well as for her two previous, and more deserving nominations for the aforementioned 'Cat', and 'Suddenly, Last Summer,' (1959).

THE SANDPIPER (1965) is one of Elizabeth's many pairings with husband Richard Burton. While I would have liked WB to have swapped this title for 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' (1966) arguably both of their greatest work onscreen (Elizabeth won her second Oscar for her role as Martha), it's still a bit of a guilty pleasure. Elizabeth plays a Bohemian type whose son is taken from her and sent to a school run by  a priest (Burton). Taylor and Burton then enter into an affair set against the crashing waves of Big Sur, California.

4495938,5,B004XKVP7K,"Three out of four of these movies are favorites of mine of the late, great Elizabeth Taylor. Father of the Bride is very well done of course; just not my cuppa tea. Cat, Butterfield and Sandpiper are classics and I am grateful to have them in my collection.

Burton seemed a bit out of it in The Sandpiper like he wanted to be some place else. But Taylor was mesmerizing. What a combination of great acting and amazing beauty. Charlie Bronson was so young in this movie. You could tell by the shape his body was in, but his face already had that well lived in look. Wonderful actor.

I have similar sentiments concerning Butterfield 8. Everyone was in top form except for poor old Eddie Fisher. I suppose he was cast because he was Ms. Taylor's husband at the time, having lost her husband Mike Todd and consoling herself Fisher who happened to be Debbie Reynolds' husband, eventually taking him off of her hands. Fisher is about as interesting to watch as a plank of wood. But Ms. Taylor -- she was stunning and evocative.

Cat on a Hot Tin Roof? I doubt if either Newman or Taylor performed any better than they do in this movie. Ms. Taylor is at the height of her beauty and power, and so is Newman for that matter.

Shame on vendors like TCM putting these wonderful movies in dvd cases with only one button - no divider to help keep them from getting scratched. I know why they do this at their end but I don't like it o mine!",1458950400,3,1430,4.324626865671642

I think that movie was simply created so those out there who wanted to see the fantasy of Taylor being attainable. Father of the Bride is very cute. I liked that version better than the newer one simply because the focus was on the father and the mother more than it was on the daughter. The jokes were subtle and made me chuckle. The newer version felt like it had forced funny moments. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof I think I've watched 15 times since this arrived.

From ""Father of The Bride"" with Spencer Tracy, her performances simply get better and better as she matures into the screen goddess we all remember.  As Taylor was arguably the last screen beauty to have lived what we think of as the life of a typical Hollywood Movie Star, her films often reflected her personal life...and why not...her life was the stuff movies were made of! As Maggie, the cat, in ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" with Paul Newman, she sizzles as the all but abandoned wife of a husband caught up in his own personal struggles with his father and his ""best friend."" In ""Butterfield 8"" she shines as a high paid call girl and part time fashion model who falls in love with an unhappy and altogether reckless married man, played by Laurence Harvey.  She is sheer perfection in the role!  In ""The Sandpiper"" she shines again as, Laura, a free spirited and unwed mother, who questions life about her at every turn and whose son is all but taken from her and forced to be enrolled in a ""Christian"" school, San Simeon, headed by the very married, Dr. Rev. Edward Hewitt, played by Richard Burton...Taylor's real life husband at the time!

4496030,5,B004XKVP7K,"Elizabeth Taylor was undoubtedly one of the most beautiful women of all time, but unfortunately her beauty sometimes overshadowed her acting skills. I disagree with The Academy in giving her the Oscar for ""Butterfield 8"" - the move was kind of lame.  The golden stature should have been hers for her performance in ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" - it's truly Liz at her finest.

""The Sandpiper"" and ""Father of the Bride"" make this 4 movie package absolutely perfect.",1391040000,,459,4.725

4496048,5,B004XKVP7K,"Elizabeth Taylor is great as usual and as expected.  I really wasn't a great fan of Liz in my lifetime.  It wasn't until later on in life that I really started looking at her movies with interest.  She was really a very very good actress.  Not just a walking and talking beauty.  The story plots range from delightful in the case of Father of the Bride to heart-wrenching in the Sandpiper.  I loved all of these movies and I will watch them again and again.  You can't go wrong with this set.  The only thing missing is ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf"".... but then that movie is so good, it deserves to be on a disc alone.  You'll love this movie pack.  Liz is wonderful in all the movies.  I sure will miss her.  May she rest in peace.",1363651200,,736,4.215827338129497
