8092550,5,B000BTO1L4,"Amuse Bouche: A Chef's Tale was a documentary that was a little bit rough around the edges, but its content was great.  It is about Chef Barbara Lynch from South Boston, and how she became a nationally known chef.  My husband is an aspiring chef and was very touched by the documentary, as he found it to be a motivator to those in the field.  I would reccommend this short documentary to anyone from the inner city who is seriously interested in becoming a chef.  Chef Barbara Lynch is a true inspiration.",1255564800,4,506,4.467391304347826
