7240740,5,B00YSBFFZM,"A great buy for my 2.5 year old! It has all of his favorite Nick Jr. shows and it teaches him about changes that occur in Fall - leaves changing colors, the temperature getting cooler, needing a jacket, etc.  It also introduced him to show The Fresh Beat Band which we hadn't watched on TV but he absolutely loves as well. We keep it in the car to entertain him during short & long trips!",1443830400,4,388,4.173333333333333

7240800,4,B00YSBFFZM,"My daughter loves Paw Patrol and the two episodes on this dvd are super cute and perfect for fall. She also likes the Bubble Guppies and Team Umizumi, but not the others. Overall it's been great to incorporate more fall themed learning through our 30 min of morning cartoons each day. I won't pay for cable and Netflix doesn't have some of her favorites. Nick Jr. programs are great!",1447804800,,383,4.565217391304348
