7878046,5,6304839723,"I have visited Southern Africa almost every year during the past 20 years.  During that time I have had the opportunity to visit Botswana several times, and have been to the Okavango Delta several times.  I have experienced the beauty of the sunsets, and the magic of the African night, the ROAR of the lion and the grunt of the hippo, the crystal-clear water of the channels, the excitement of tracking elephant on foot through the shallows and in the papyrus grass.  The quality and excitement of Tim Liversedge's filmography is so appealing, the script so compelling, and James Coburn's reading so engaging, I felt I was back there in the magic of Africa's Wild Oasis.  If you care at all about wildlife, and about nature... you MUST own this video.  Also watch for his upcoming IMAX film: ""The ROAR of Power""",983059200,2,812,4.690140845070423
