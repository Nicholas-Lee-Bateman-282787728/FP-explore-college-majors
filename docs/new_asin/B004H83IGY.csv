4375271,5,B004H83IGY,"I loved Tarzan movies when I was a kid and I still love them.  Even though there were several actors who portrayed Tarzan, Johnny Weissmuller was the best. I am so glad to have Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 in my collection.",1316736000,2,212,4.0476190476190474
4375272,5,B004H83IGY,"To put it in simple terms: The Weissmuller-Tarzans by MGM were the best. Take it from me, I watched them for mor than fifty years.",1313452800,9,130,4.24
4375273,5,B004H83IGY,very good sound and video quality for 1930's movie. I saw these movies when I was little. Johnny weismuler plays a really good tarzen. I think he was the best.,1310688000,2,159,4.333333333333333
4375274,5,B004H83IGY,"This is the ninth film that Johnny Weissmuller made as Tarzan of the twelve that he made. It is the first that Brenda Joyce starred in as Jane. She did three more with Weissmuller and then one with his successor Les Barker. She played Jane in more movies that Maureen O'Sullivan. Johnny Sheffield is Boy again. All three are excellent.

 All of the Weissmuller Tarzan films have the generally same plot, but are still well-worth seeing. They are fun to watch. Tarzan is primal man, not at all bright. Boy is able to speak English as a regular American youngster. Tarzan can usually only grunt - nicely, of course - single phrases. Boy, in this film, memorizes an entire long poem. Tarzan is unable to memorize a single line, even after many attempts. But he has good common sense and a good heart, understands his world, enjoys it immensely, and wants no interference from outside. In fact, in each film, it is Jane or Boy who insists on doing things Tarzan knows is wrong and gets the trio in trouble.

 In this film Tarzan rescues an amazon woman from a panther and carries her back to her people, after warning Boy not to follow him. Tarzan restrains Boy because of his promise to the amazons that he will not reveal their existence or location. They have the same desire as Tarzan to be left alone. But he is unable to articulate this to his son who enjoys the company of others, and Boy follows him; and Boy later reveals the location to men who want to steal the gold held by the beautiful amazons.",1307404800,6,1504,4.478102189781022

4375277,5,B004H83IGY,"My wife loves the Tarzan stories and has read 8 different books 3 times and insisted we get the old DVD's of the ""Real Tarzan""
stories.  They are very exciting and makes my wife sit on the edge of her chair at times from all the excitement that Tarzan gets into
and out of.",1499990400,,273,4.055555555555555
4375278,4,B004H83IGY,"This second volume follows chronologically the first one albeit two MGM films are missing. My favorite films here are Tarzan's Secret Treasure and New York Adventure. In this latter film, Tarzan jumps from the Brooklyn Bridge. Spectacular! And even zoo elephants come to the rescue at the end of the film. The RKO productions of The Amazons and the Leopard Woman are moderately entertaining. In these films, Maureen O'Sullivan is replaced by Brenda Joyce. Although Joyce is cute, she can't fill the shoes of O'Sullivan. She always seems too out of place in the jungle, too civilized. O'Sullivan seemed to me to fit well in Tarzan's paradise. I missed her there. I also missed the Tarzan yell, and although there are some fight scenes, I also missed some of that energy that we saw in the MGM films. Even a fight with an alligator at the beginning of The Amazons never compared to similar encounters in earlier films. And I also missed the Tarzan yell and the elephants and gorillas who would come to aid Tarzan in these latter RKO films. Nevertheless, I found this purchase worthwhile and almost as enjoyable as the films of the first volume.",1499731200,,1142,4.7727272727272725

4375443,4,B004H83IGY,"This second volume of Johnny Weissmuller's ""Tarzan"" is almost as much fun as the first collection offered by Turner Classic Movies. With this collection you get:

Tarzan's Secret Treasure (1941) - In this entry, Boy discovers a bunch of gold sitting at the bottom of the jungle family's swimming hole, and uses the odd rocks for his slingshot. Not long after, a safari stumbles it's way onto Tarzan's escarpment looking to capture some exotic animals, but learns of the gold. Hoping to find the source of the gold, the men will stop at nothing to discover the hidden treasure.

Tarzan's New York Adventure (1942) - This one is a lot of fun, and probably the highlight of this collection. While trying to capture wild animals for his circus, a ruthless animal trainer discovers Boy's talent with animals. Thinking that Tarzan and Jane have been killed by a native tribe, they take Boy back to New York to put him on display. Jane and Tarzan follow the trail of the circus owner all the way back to New York City where Tarzan must learn to deal with civilization. Cheeta is riot in this one,

Tarzan and the Amazons (1945) - Tarzan rescues a beautiful young woman from being attacked by a Panther. Tarzan sees by her jewelry that she belongs to a hidden tribe of Amazon women, Taking the wounded girl home, Boy follows Tarzan and learns the location of the lost tribe. Some treasure hungry men learn that Boy knows where the Amazon women are located and convince him to lead them to where no man (except Tarzan) has gone before.

Tarzan and the Leopard Woman (1946) - Education is coming to Africa, but one tribe does not want outsiders to civilize their region. Instead this tribe worships a Leopard god, and sends their warriors dressed in Leopard skins with claws to attack caravans. A young warrior wants to prove himself by bringing back Jane's heart for the Leopard god.

Each of these films are fun in some way, and if you are a ""Tarzan"" fan, then you should definitely have these movies in your collection. The only thing holding me back from a five-star rating is Brenda Joyce's ""Jane"". Maureen O'Sullivan made that role, and it's hard to see someone else step in. Specifically in ""Tarzan and the Leopard Woman"", Jane does little more than stand around looking scared and helpless, even when Boy is fighting for his life, Joyce's Jane does nothing to help? In the earlier films Jane wasn't helpless, and showed real strength.

Still, these are great films that I will re-visit often.",1404691200,6,2490,4.68649885583524
4375444,5,B004H83IGY,The DVD came in good condition and in a timely manor.  I love the movies and they are great as they remind me of childhood.,1402876800,,123,3.92
4375445,4,B004H83IGY,"Grew up watching Tarzan in the 50's and now in the 21st century it is still good.  Come across a scene every now and then when the stunts of effects are bad, but considering what they had to work with then what can you expect.  After all these years Tarzan is still great to watch.  They are good enough to stand the test of time.  Do not regret buying this CD and will probably end up with more if not all of the movies.  Yes, Tarzan Rules....at least the jungle anyway.",1401494400,,471,4.131868131868132

Yes, the sound skips. Yes, the effects seem hokey. But, it's the Tarzan I know and love--just as it was in the day.

They've tried many times to revive the franchise, but none have stood the test of time like Weissmuller's 'TARZAN'.  4 great movies to sit down and watch and share with those who may have never seen these classics.  They've been able to 're-invent' Batman, Spiderman and Superman, but these are still the best Tarzan collection.",1391558400,2,379,5.080645161290323

4375456,3,B004H83IGY,"The Tarzan New York Adventure was a classic Tarzan flick, one of the best. But the others lacked the same entertainment value. Perhaps it is because Brenda Joyce just doesn't make nearly as good a Jane as Maureen O'Sullivan.",1384905600,3,224,4.769230769230769

Highly recommend it !",1348444800,,236,4.9
4375487,4,B004H83IGY,"A recent discussion with an old friend had reminded me of how much fun those old Tarzan movies were, so I got this package because it contains the greatest Tarzan film ever made; bar none: "" Tarzan's New York Adventure"". The other three are also most excellent, but nothing tops Tarzan in NY. A sleazy circus owner kidnaps Boy and makes him a circus attraction in NY, so Tarzan, Jane and Cheetah must travel to NY to rescue him. During a child-custody hearing for Boy, a slimy lawyer conducts a brutal cross-examination of Jane, so a nattily-dressed Tarzan flings him across the courtroom. WOW! This must be seen to be believed. Trust me, it's the ultimate fantasy of everyone who's ever been in court or who has been forced to consort with lawyers. Anyway, if anybody wants to get in touch with their inner child for a couple hours, try this collection of flicks of Johnny Weismuller as Tarzan. Just relax and let them work their magic and you'll be transported away from your cares and worries and feel like a little kid again for a very pleasant mini-vacation.
