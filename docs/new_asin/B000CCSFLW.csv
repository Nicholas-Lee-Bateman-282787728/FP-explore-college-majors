Sal Mineo was right for his part too.  Don't you think it's time for a remake with todays looser restrictions on projecting reality?,1415836800,2,311,4.703703703703703
2457328,5,B000CCSFLW,"Rebel Without A Cause is a story about a rebellious teenager who arrives at a new high school. It narrates many events of his life like when he meets a girl that he fell in love with,when he disobeyed his parents, and the event when he defied the local school bullies. It was a groundbreaking attempt to portray the moral decay of American youth and it critiques parental style that led to it. Finally,it explores the differences and conflicts between generations. It stars James Dean,who definitely captured the enigma of his screen persona that made him a legend.",1414800000,,565,4.775510204081633

2457330,4,B000CCSFLW,"Good, solid 'audience' picture, pre-sold because Dean was in it.  The fact that he'd been dead a month before the original release made it seem more important that it probably really was. The teenage angst is all over the place in this very first such drama to be unleashed on the public. Natalie Wood does her best hysterical teenager and Sal Mineo shines as a deeply troubled adoleseant. It was new then. But it still holds up, today. Even though this disc got some bad reviews on color quality. I found it to look quite good. A great sense of that 50s Warner Color dazzle really helps to sell this revision. I had the  dvd and  pan-and-scan and letter boxed laser discs.  So, I am definitely a fan. This obviously looks a lot better than any of them",1406505600,5,752,4.427536231884058
2457331,3,B000CCSFLW,"I was surprised to note how dated this movie now seems.  ""East of Eden"" is a much finer film -- Dean's best.

The best of both of those films is the music score by Leonard Rosenman, who used atonality in his film scores.",1405987200,,220,4.093023255813954
2457332,3,B000CCSFLW,"I had read many other reviews on the Dean Blu-Rays. ""EAST OF EDEN"" is the best. But the other two should be Recalled and redone properly. Natalie's lips in the jail scene in the beginning look like those wax lips kids wear on Halloween. They don't look like her real lips. That alone turned me off as well as having to reduce the coloring in the whole movie. I had to turn the coloring down. I bought used copies that are practically giving them away. ""GIANT"" arrived later. The dust scene behind the credits didn't look like dust. Just a mess. And compared to ""CLEOPATRA"" the best Blu-Ray there is, ""GIANT"" on a one to ten is about a five. WARNER BROS has had a lot of lousy DVD transfers in the past, even on VHS. No quality control what-so-ever. Get them out and make $$$ no matter the quality. So they can build more studio high rises on their studio property. And defective DVDs. Forget it. They ignore them if you send them back. You just lose out.",1402358400,2,954,4.335195530726257

2457337,5,B000CCSFLW,"Great Movie, Before My Time...",1495065600,,30,5.2
2457338,4,B000CCSFLW,"Released in 1955, Rebel without a Cause is a youth drama about a troubled teen, Jim Stark (James Dean), a new kid on the block in Los Angeles, where he meets other confused mid-50s youths, e.g. Judy (Natalie Wood) and Plato (Sal Mineo). Corey Allen plays Jims rival, Buzz, while Jim Backus & Ann Doran appear as Jims parents. Dennis Hopper and Nick Adams are on hand as other juvenile delinquents.

In real life the three protagonists would all die prematurely: Dean one month before the film was released (24 years-old), Natalie in 1981 (43 years old) and Mineo in 1976 (37 years-old). While Dean was 24 during filming, both Natalie and Mineo were actually teenagers, 17 and 16 respectively. This was particularly amazing for the former, as she comes across seasoned, although obviously youthful.

The movies iconic and seminal, but other teen angst movies predated it, like Brandos The Wild One, which debuted 20 months before Rebel. Yet The Wild One is lame by comparison. While Brando is almost always great, Rebel is less eye-rolling than The Wild One and more dramatically engaging, not to mention psychologically interesting. A compelling knife fight pulls the viewer in early on, which culminates with the tragic chickie run sequence. Unfortunately, the movie is overly talky with too much filler; it couldve been tightened up by cutting like 20-25 minutes.

Writer/director Nicholas Ray interestingly never shows teachers or school faculty, which shows that they're negligible as influences for the confused youths. Notice how the astronomer at the Observatory drones on in a boring monotone. He bleakly insists that life on earth is meaningless in the grand scope of the universe, which ironically is meaningless to the teens, each of whom is the center of the universe, as far as they're concerned. Only their parents, peers and police hold sway in their worlds. The sole adult to really understand them is Officer Ray, clearly named after the writer/director.

One presumptuous critic argued that Plato (Mineo) was a homosexual on the grounds that he caresses Jims shoulder in the Observatory and later invites him to his house where theyd be alone, but Platos interest in Jim is obviously simply hero worship as Plato looks for a worthy father figure to pattern his life, which Jim literally becomes in the charade with Judy at the deserted mansion (notice how Plato has no problem with Judys presence). Basically, Plato is to Jim what Barney Rubble was to Fred Flintstone. The caress is merely a tap on the shoulder and the fact that it was misinterpreted by this critic informs you about his own dubious sexuality. Mineos later confessed bisexuality is irrelevant to the topic.

While Dean lacks the intense charisma of Brando, hes inimitable, enigmatic and somewhat interesting. His character, Jim, is surprisingly NOT one-dimensional. Too bad he died so young (breaking his neck in an auto accident).

The picture runs 111 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles & the surrounding areas (Burbank Studios, Santa Monica High School & Calabasas). ADDITIONAL WRITERS: Stewart Stern & Irving Shulman. ADDITIONAL CAST: Marietta Canty appears as Platos loving black guardian while William Hopper & Rochelle Hudson are on hand as Judys parents.

2457340,4,B000CCSFLW,"A very famous movie, but an odd one and a rather dated one.  It's smartly put together, quite well-written, and the acting is just fine (though Dean's performance doesn't seem to me particularly spectacular), with Sal Mineo's character, Plato, perhaps being the most interesting one.  The first thing a cop says to him, very early in the movie, is ""Why did you shoot these puppies?""  We never really find out the answer to that particular question, but as the movie goes on, Plato attaches himself to Jim Stark (Dean) in a way that seems both (or alternately) homoerotic and filial -- and Jim Stark, while clearly sympathetic to Plato's unhappiness, isn't interested in taking on either role.  Nor does Jim really understand Plato's problems any more than we do, beyond the fact that he has been in effect deserted by both his wealthy parents.  That's not good, of course, but shooting puppies . . .?  Without a cause, then?  Well, not a cause when we think of rebels as having political causes or ideological stances, and it's a bit odd that a broader political dimension is absent from the movie.  The kids seem to be solid middle-class, and this is the decade of the burgeoning civil rights movement (the movie came out in 1955), but they seem to be more interested in the cosmos and the heat-death of the universe than their wider society.  Strikingly too, there seems to be no interest in sex, for while Dean and Natalie Wood play nicely nicely together, they aren't given a sexual dimension to their relationship.

BUT in another sense, a less direct one, the movie is about sex, or at least gender.  Jim's unhappiness, to the extent that we can understand it, seems focused on his mother's domination of his father (Jim Backus), a nice man who wears the apron in the house.  To Jim, his dad won't stand up for him when his mother lays down the law, and he sees him as a coward -- a ""chicken,"" which to Jim is the worst thing a supposed man can be, and it's his determination to show that HE isn't chicken which sets up the event that leads to the movie's painful conclusion (avoiding spoilers here, just in case . . .).  So he wants a less ambiguous role model, maybe?  Although Jim's own instincts are to be kind and helpful when he can, so maybe it bothers him that he can't fit that aspect of his nature together with a more assertive masculine image.  Judy (Natalie Wood), the girl who becomes attracted to Jim, also has family issues -- in her case, it's clear that her father (William Hopper) is uncomfortable with her growing up and is perhaps suppressing what he fears to be incestuous feelings.  None of this is articulated, of course -- the kids say they're ""confused,"" but it's clear that the adults -- the parents -- are no less confused.  Oddly, it's the law enforcement personnel who seem most willing to cut the kids some slack.  Ray Fremick (Edward Platt) seems to be a social worker who works out of the police department, and he seems willing to talk to Jim like an adult, so to speak.  High School, as represented here seems all about masculinity -- it's like ""Grease"" without the music -- and Jim, who is a new kid in town, has to run the gauntlet of the alpha males (Corey Allen and the young Dennis Hopper among them).  If the movie has center, it's this concern with masculinity that seems to be it.  The kids don't seem to have a useful language for it, and the adults clearly don't want to talk about it.  Underlying it all, is probably the fashionable, at the time, Freudian notion of repression.  Except for Plato, though, the effects, while intense, are a bit tame.  Not a bad movie, though.  A classic?  Not really.",1478304000,,3651,4.54434250764526

8097524,1,B000CCSFLW,"Rebel Without A Cause, 1955 film

It begins with a young man playing with a toy monkey. [Symbolism?] Two policemen take him in for plain drunkenness. A detective talks to Judy, she has a problem with her father and was out after curfew. John Crawford is also there with his housekeeper. Jims parents come for him. John shot his puppies! Is he beyond help? His mother left him behind when she went on a visit. Jims parents have conflicts. The detective talks to Jim in private. Is Jim angry? He is unhappy at home, and confused. His father cautions him about choosing pals. Judys friends arrive in a crowded car and take her to school. Jim arrives and learns the rules. There is a trip to a planetarium. The lecturer talks about the end of the earth when struck by a large asteroid. [The meaningless of life?]

Is that gang laying for Jim? They sit on his car, Buzz cuts a tire! Next the blade game. the guard chases them away. At home Jim talks to his Dad, who wears an apron over his jacket! We see Judys troubled home life. Will she outgrow it? Jims father sees the stains on his shirt. Did he ever stop Jim from doing anything? [Permissive parents?] Jim leaves in his car and goes to that deserted area. Jim and Buzz race towards a cliff, who will stop first? There is an accident. Jim, John, and Judy go to that abandoned mansion. Plato talks about his trip to a psychiatrist who made him remember things. [Recovered memory? Did it cure this fatherless son?] Judy and Jim become friendly.

Others arrive in the dark. The police see this housebreaking and call for backup. There are shots! The police order the shooter to come out. Other police cars arrive, one has Jims parents. Johns housekeeper arrives. A boy and girl ran into the planetarium. They talk to Plato. [This pads out the story.] Jim asks for the gun, but Plato says he needs it. Jim removes the magazine then returns it. He tells Plato the people outside are friends. Plato runs outside with his gun, the police shoot and hit Plato! Jims father talks to him. Jim laughs and cries at this ending. You can depend on me says Jims father. What will their future be like? Will Jim and Judy go to college and become successful? Will they become drop outs? Or turn to drugs and alcohol?

When I first saw this around 1957 it seemed like a phony story, so too sixty years later. How many males then wore a scarlet jacket? Or was this some sign? The people seem like characters in a comedy posing as a serious drama. This was written and produced by Nicholas Ray. It is a message movie that seems unlike most teenagers in the 1950s. What was its message? A lack of parental discipline and oversight creates juvenile delinquents? This came from a book by a psychiatrist who said it was based on recovered memories.",1522281600,,2773,4.463510848126233

8097529,3,B000CCSFLW,"The ending really shows how our times have changed.  I wasn't born when the movie was first released.  I was the next generation.  Watching it for the first time at the age of 58.  Enjoyed the movie mostly because of James Dean, Sal Mineo, and Natilee Wood. This movie appears to be one of the first ""juvenille deliquencey"" flicks of the 50's, but also one of the first maybe to reflect dysfunction familys.  The parents in the movie are self absorbed and like booze.  The mother is domineering and the father is weak (even wears his wife's apron and makes her breakfast in bed.).  James Dean's character is sensative which was a cool contrast to the other teenagers (including girls) who behave like bullys. Sal Mineo's character by todays standard may be gay.  He has a picture of Tab Hunter inside his school locker door.  He idolizes Dean through out the movie.  It may have been the directors way of presenting a gay character for that segment of the audience who ""read between the lines"".  The values that all go into a good film are noticable.  I didn't give a 5 star because some of the writing just didn't seem probable.  I think this movie might be the shift in how masculity (the rugged men of old days to the sensitve men of today) changed the culture. This probably had mixed reactions from the generation who was around to see Rebel Without A Cause when it was first released.  A movie worth watching.",1513209600,,1415,4.541501976284585
