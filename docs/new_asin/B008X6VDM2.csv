The quality of the sound and picture were much better than

I thought would be possible for Stallone's first film role.

The only other version I have seen of this film was totally

cut up and mostly unwatchable.  This edition really rocks!

The period music and fashion styles of the actors really

takes you back to the early 1970's.  Even though this film

is low budget it has much more heart and visual style than

I had ever expected.  Much better than the soulless big budget Hollywood projects of today. Certainly much better than

5187663,4,B008X6VDM2,"If you are expecting ""Cliffhanger or ""Rocky"" you're in for a big surprise. This is the real and complete version of Party at Kitty and Stud's later re named Italian Stallion which was shot on 8mm film in 1970 and later tranferred to 35mm once Stallone hit the big time. This is more of a curiosity piece than an actual movie but it is Sylvester Stallone's first starring role. An underground movie made before Behind the Green Door or Deep Throat and does not have the same production values as today's movies but it's a piece of movie history and it's fun.",1106352000,18,557,4.470588235294118

8531597,1,B008X6VDM2,"The Party at Kitty and Stud's, which is now known as the Italian Stallion,was the first movie of one of the most famous physical movie star,Sylvester Stallone back in 1970.

There is nothing more to it except the sex life of a young New York woman,Kitty,who was portrayed by Henrietta Holm, and her boyfriend Stud,performed by Stallone, ranges from group sex,sadomasochism and sexual pleasure between the two.

Just like any usual porno film,there is no plot,story,character development and theme but only sexual intercourse and nothing more. Besides,it is definitely outdated compared to the ones made today considering it was made more than 40 years ago and it would only be considered R-rated today since actors and actresses are only doing graphic nudity in their lovemaking. What only makes it worth watching is the participation of Stallone himself. It is also worth noting is the fact why Stallone did very well in his sex scenes in his movies like that in the shower scene with Sharon Stone in ""The Specialist"" is he got good training from this film now known as either The Italian Stallion or Party At Kitty And Stud's.

8531599,1,B008X6VDM2,"A little history & trivia behind this strange film:

IMDB lists this as Sly's first movie (1970), which really isn't accurate. The official title is: The Party at Kitty and Stud's. In a Playboy interview after the success of Rocky, Stallone told the interviewer that the film paid $200, & it took 2 days to shoot. He was a nobody at the time, and he was starving and really needed the money. In fact, in the movie, he looks rather emaciated.

This film project actually started out as a different (soft-porn) movie all together, with Sly as just another supporting actor (not the lead). Then, almost 8 years later, after the success of Rocky, the studio thought they had struck gold. They dug up all the scrap reels that had Stallone in it, re-edited the film, and re-released it (to porn houses).

So the release date (1970) is a misnomer. Yes, the scenes were *shot* in 1970 (Stallone was 24 at the time), but movie was not put together and released until 1978.

After the success of Rocky, it was actually a surprise to Stallone to learn this movie even existed. He obviously remembered shooting it, but he had no idea he was the ""star""! He must have thought it would just be some small uncredited role he did years ago, never actually saw the final product, and must have been shocked to see his name on movie posters at XXX houses.

As you can guess, it's problematic trying to make a movie from scraps of a different movie. Sly had almost no speaking roles, was not in any great sex scenes, and there was not enough footage to put a plot together successfully.

Stallone's character wasn't even important enough to have a name! So the editors had to do a voice-over, proclaiming that his name was ""Stud"".

The film is widely available online (for free). Sure it sounds titillating, but it's really quite boring & not worth watching. It was short (about 66 minutes), and I had a very difficult time sitting through more than a few minutes of it.

For example, the first 3-4 minutes are Stallone running through a snowy field (fully clothed), jumping on park benches & swinging from monkey bars to some Rocky-style music. It made no sense, & didn't add anything to the plot. The Rocky music was obviously part of the re-edit.

If you're curious, I suggest googling it, you'll find the movie (or some clips) and watch what you want online. I guarantee, most of you will not need to see more than 5 minutes of this (thus, no point in buying/owning it). If you're just looking for a ""full"" view of Stallone and the rest of the cast, just skip to the last 5 minutes.

There was no actual intercourse between Stud & Kitty (or the other women), as far as I could tell. There were certainly many sex scenes, with lots of pseudo-intercourse, but no close-up shots and the body parts were just too far apart actually to make contact. Most of the film can be characterized as frontal nudity, with only a few brief shots of a nude Sly. (For example, in the fellatio scene with Sly, he kept his shirt on & back to the camera - not even certain the fellatio was real)

Also, people who have seen this have noted that Stallone appears to be, well, lacking a little bit in size. I would point out several things. Sly was completely flaccid through the entire film. Not a single full erection (neither of the 2 male actors), so ""size"" would be difficult to determine by watching this film. In fact, none of the actors really seemed ""excited"" to be there. I have no idea how these films work, but it seems like being on camera for 2 straight days (20 hours of shooting), with lights, cameras, & people all around, it might be difficult to get (or stay) aroused. Also, this was one of his first ""acting"" experiences (I'm sure there was anxiety). And the temperature may have been a factor (this was shot in the winter of 1970, in New York).

Finally, keep in mind, the director probably didn't pay too much attention to Stallone (an ""extra"") - they just wanted a young, fit guy as ""window dressing"" in the background. They did not intend for him to be the star, or the film's focus.

There was a sequence that was strange, funny, & disturbing. The sequence Stud cuts his hand, and Kitty erotically licks off the blood. Then they move to the bathroom to finish cleaning the wound, where Kitty offers follatio to Stud, who warns her not to bite (foreshadowing...the true sign of a great script). Kitty responds with the only funny line in the movie, really: ""I'll be velvet-mouthed on your shank of love!""

During that awkward scene, Kitty ends up biting Stud's shank of love, & he proceeds to whip her with a belt for 3-4 minutes. Maybe this kind of violence in porn is normal, but I just found it awkward & disturbing.

The over-arching ""plot"" (if you can call it that), is that Stud & Kitty want to spice things up, so they decide to host a party which turns into a ""light"" orgy. In reality, though, it was more of a ""dog pile"", with 4 women and 2 men, mostly gyrating and touching themselves. It was far from sexy. Afterward, the group held hands and spun in a circle for 4-5 minutes (most of the shots were above-the-waist). As the grand finale, the camera got in the middle of the dancing circle, and we get a 3-4 second close-up shot of everyone's genitals as they spun around.

Overall, the video quality is poor, much of the film is out of focus, & there is almost no dialog in the film (mostly dancing & gyrating, in front of mirrors, etc). Maybe this would make a nice gag gift for somebody, but seriously, unless you just need to own every Stallone movie ever made, I just don't see the point in owning this. But now you have some movie trivia for your next dinner party! LOL",1382572800,14,5671,4.45945945945946
8531600,1,B008X6VDM2,"The Italian Stallion(1976, also known as The Party at Kitty and Stud's) is a really bad movie. All My Children and Mexican soap operas are sexier than this film! Sylvester Stallone gave us Rocky(1976) and First Blood(1982), so he's redeemed himself, more or less. There's no hardcore sex scenes in the film, but there's a lot of unappealing frontal nudity! Some prints of this film are called ""Bocky""! There's a theatrical trailer with filmmaker Gail Palmer telling us about the film. Parts of this film have good camera work. We get to see Stallone doing Rocky stuff on a playground. This film is a nostalgic, Z grade turkey.",1360627200,6,626,4.805555555555555

8531602,5,B008X6VDM2,"I know people might try to debate that the first ""Rocky"" or perhaps even the first ""Rambo/First Blood"" film shows off Stallone's acting talents much better then this small independant film made at the start of his career.  But for me, this shows off Stallone's true acting talent, true skills.  The subtle nuiances he gives the character of ""Stud"" truly make the film come alive.  The fact that his first film was a romantic comedy with some slight erotic undertones (although perhaps not as erotic as let's say ""Stop, Or My Mom Will Shoot"") shows what might have been if Stallone hadn't picked a direction like drama with Rocky, and action films with the Rambo films.  Believe me, although I suppose both make good ""popcorn"" movies, his acting pales in comparsion to the work in this film.  Rent this, buy this, borrow this, or do whatever else you must do to see this.  You'll regret not seeing this film on your deathbed if you don't, it is that good.  The only minus?  There's some odd sex scenes that seem to have very little to do with the plot or character development, but this was the freewheeling 70's too, and I'm sure they were put in to heighten the erotic aspects of this film.  (Again, I find ""Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot"" a bit more erotic, though).",1283817600,,1263,4.52863436123348
8531603,2,B008X6VDM2,"Well this movie really cuts down Sylvestor Stallons reputation as a stud,We finally get to see that Sylvestor Stallon although all muscled up for many years has a very small penis. Even in this film he is unable to get an erection and stays soft most of the time. It is funny in the one scene when hes running you here what seems to be the Rocky theme,that was kinda strange. I guess the steroid abuse over the years maybe maid his penis and testicles smaller.....Unfortunately another reviewer states that years and years of steroid abuse must have made Slys testicles small but in reality this was way before he started steriods just by looking at his build you can tell,His penis was very very small and no erection was able to be made by sly,even with hot girls around,but maybe girls do not turn him on,we have not ever heard about him being linked to any woman..Might be the Italian Stallion Rocky might be gay.",1262995200,3,917,4.530120481927711
8531604,3,B008X6VDM2,"I have a problem with this movie, seriously, I couldn't understand anything Stallone was saying, let alone get into the sex action. When he said, well, I think he said ""Oh yes Kitty it's growing"" I couldn't help but laugh. I think what he meant was 'Oh yes Kitty keep going' I would not buy this movie, but maybe borrow it from a friend if you want a cheap whack-it session.",1228262400,,374,4.28169014084507
