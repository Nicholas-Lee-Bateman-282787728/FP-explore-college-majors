3822640,5,B001VJTIUW,"A solid, balanced Kundalini practice... as difficult as you need it to be but easy to follow.  I like the way Dr. Gabrielle flashes to a screen of her doing the pose as she gets you set for it.  There is so much here, yet the DVD is simple and peaceful... Loved that each part can be practiced separately... If you only have 15 minutes... I felt totally energized after this DVD, and I have tons to work up to!  Ultimately, what makes a good DVD is often the personality of the instructor.  Dr. Gabrielle has an awesome energy and a knack for clear guidance.  Will report back after using it for a while!",1239235200,,604,4.2631578947368425
3822641,5,B001VJTIUW,"I was searching for a program to lengthen my hamstrings and the rest of my body after many years of cycling and other sports. This DVD is great to pop in and follow along. It moves right along and is easy to watch and follow....very straight-forward and direct.

I highly recommend this for anyone wishing to change the way they feel.",1239235200,,334,4.475409836065574
3822642,5,B001VJTIUW,"This is the video in my collection that I find myself reaching for the most. It makes me feel great all over: body, mind, and spirit. After doing it for several months on a regular basis I still find some parts challenging. Bottom Line- If you are looking to add yoga in your life you should try this tape.",1238889600,,306,4.203389830508475

I loved making this DVD. We shot at gorgeous locations in Malibu and downtown LA. This is the same workout that I use with my high-profile and athlete clients.  I do this workout all the time because I love the way it makes me feel.  I hope you enjoy doing the video as much as I enjoyed making it.

3822644,4,B001VJTIUW,"I thought this was a pretty good Kundalini Yoga DVD.  I don't mind watching yoga at the beach but even not being overweight I doubt I'd do it in a bikini.  Ya, ya, I know we do this type of yoga with our eyes closed but it just made me think this was more of a selling tactic.
But other than that - not bad.  There are other Kundalini DVDs I've liked better, and had better workouts too.",1244592000,4,387,3.9358974358974357
3822645,5,B001VJTIUW,"I am new to yoga and admit to having felt intimidated by it in the past.  While the video is challenging,I never felt discouraged or out of sorts.  I loved all aspects of the video: the visuals, the education, the simple instructions, being able to select each part separately and the exercises themselves.  I definitely plan to incorporate it into my workout routine and begin attending some yoga classes.  I think it will work well for me as I need to feel centered, work on my breathing, relax and meditate while also feeling energized and stengthened.  Gabrielle has produced an awesome video!",1243209600,,597,4.813725490196078
3822646,5,B001VJTIUW,I look forward to doing this when I wake up in the morning.  I love the different scenes (especially the beach) throughout the video - very relaxing!  It challenges me and I feel so much better when I've completed this workout.  Dr. Pelicci is an amazing instructor!,1242172800,,266,4.617021276595745
3822647,5,B001VJTIUW,I had been looking for a kundalini yoga instructional video because it was recommended to me by a yoga therapist to try that style.  I really like this video as Dr. Pelicci does a great job at not going too fast and at explaining with enough detail what one is supposed to do.  I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a balanced workout.,1241481600,,343,4.2615384615384615
3822648,5,B001VJTIUW,"From the tone of her voice to the background music, from the breathtaking visuals to the flow of the movements, Gabrielle has succeeded in creating a serene, centering workout that is just what I need after a hectic day of demanding clients, rambunctious children, and barking dogs.  It never ceases to amaze me that I am breathing heavy and perspiring at the conclusion of the dvd, because I almost always lose myself in the yoga.  Serenity!",1240531200,2,442,4.802631578947368
3822649,5,B001VJTIUW,"I have been practicing yoga for a few years and always wanted to try Kundalini. Watching this video I am now addicted! Dr. Gabrielle is very informative about the body. She is not intimidating, but extremely warm and encouraging. This is an amazing workout!
The music on this DVD is fantastic too! It really connects with the flow and movement of the exercises.
I will definitely incorporate Dr. Gabrielle Pelicci's Kundalini DVD into my everyday yoga practice. I recommend it to anyone interested in Kundalini yoga or anyone looking for a new and challenging, yet energizing feel-good workout, for not only the body but the mind and spirit as well.",1240272000,2,649,4.909090909090909
3822650,5,B001VJTIUW,"I have wanted to try kundalini yoga for awhile but have been very intimidated by it. So when i finally decided to try a video I stumbled upon this one. I was a little unsure what to expect before going into it, but I took the plunge and really loved it!! I was surprised at how easy she makes it. Dr. Gabrielle explains everything really well and creates a very peaceful atmosphere to learn. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to do yoga irregardless of your skill level.",1239926400,,478,4.382022471910112
3822651,5,B001VJTIUW,"Dr. Pellicci has created an exceptional at home experience for the student.  Kundalini Yoga integrates yoga with a little more cardio sprinkled in.  I love it and I feel like I get more form this workout than I sometimes get at the gym.  It is a full body workout that is very manageable in my hectic life.  All of the serene scenes depicted in the dvd will take you away to a yoga oasis of serenity.

3822652,5,B001VJTIUW,"I just finished my first go at this workout. I consider myself an intermediate practitioner at least, and even still, I found it to be an aggressive (yet doable) session. You won't find most of these poses and movements at your neighborhood yoga studio, and the structure is such that you learn the movement, and then practice on your own to ethereal music, which varies by segment and is thematically appropriate. The routine was expertly chosen and if you don't believe me, I dare you to come to Philadelphia and personally grab my butt. Can't wait to do it again.",1239321600,,566,4.67
3822653,5,B001VJTIUW,This is my favorite yoga dvd! Gabrielle is an amazing instructor and I love the way this workout makes me feel.  I strongly recommend this to anyone who wants to feel and look better and healthier.,1239321600,,197,4.472222222222222
8346551,5,B001VJTIUW,"I have had this DVD for several years, and it is one I go back to a lot. I like the breathing instructions and the work out part is pretty challenge!",1500163200,,149,3.838709677419355
8346552,5,B001VJTIUW,Wonderful production quality.  Would recommend to any level.,1444176000,,60,6.5
8346553,4,B001VJTIUW,"I really liked how this kundalini yoga DVD focused on core strength.  I've watched it and practiced along maybe half a dozen times and it's definitely challenging.  Minor irritations include frequent backdrop and wardrobe changes, split screen pictures, and a soundtrack with a lot of intentional clicking -- but that's what the mute button is for.  The main benefit of this video is it's enough of a work-out that regular practice should result in a noticeable increase in strength and flexibility.",1290211200,,499,5.135802469135802
8346554,5,B001VJTIUW,"I absolutely LOVE this dvd! It has that rare combination of simplicity and effectiveness, and really does leave you feeling healthy, sexy, and beautiful. But guys, don't be fooled - this is not a ""girly"" workout. You will sweat, you will feel invigorated, you will be challenged, and you will feel like you had a great workout inside and out. Dr. Gabrielle does a wonderful job of leading you through the entire routine herself - no standing there like an annoying cheerleader while a ""team"" does all the work behind her. The different scenery keeps it from feeling monotonous and allows you to see the moves from different angles so you can check your form. The background music is perfect and doesn't get in the way or cause you to lose focus. The moves are simple but they get the job done so well. If you're afraid to try yoga because you think you'll never be able to twist into those complicated positions - fear not - this is not that type of yoga. This is a yoga routine anyone can do and feel great about from day one. Dr. Gabrielle is friendly and personable and encourages you to move at your own pace and to focus on the breath, which is very important. And she explains the health benefits of each move. What amazed me most was how fast the hour seemed to go! I've never done a one hour workout that left me SMILING at myself at the end! I felt a great sense of accomplishment and overall well-being when I was done. Do your body and your mind a great favor and buy this dvd. You'll be so glad you did. Thank you Dr. Gabrielle Pelicci!",1281312000,5,1548,4.359861591695502
8346555,5,B001VJTIUW,"I bought both of these Kundalini dvd's from Gabrielles site, much cheaper, than if I had bought them off Amazon.  I have done H.S.B kundalini and yoga on the ball on alternate day, for the last month and already feel a lot fitter, toned, more energy and calmer, the timing on the DVD's is brilliant.
The scenery is great although you can do all the exercises in a meditative state, due to Gabrielles great cueing.
I will keep doing these dvds and getting and improving on all the benefits, I have already mentioned. And, I am 46.
Really happy, can't recommend them highly enough and another bonus, when only H.S.B.K dvd arrived without the other dvd, I became worried, so emailed Gabrielle who emailed me back the next day, explaining they are posted from different places and not to worry the other one would arrive shortly, which indeed it did.
And, I live in the United Kingdom now that is what I call brilliant service.
Well done, Gabrielle these dvd are definately keepers.",1264550400,7,978,4.6531791907514455
8346556,4,B001VJTIUW,"What a workout!  Get ready to experience Kundalini yoga as a group of exercises that will awaken every cell in your body.  The pace of the DVD is perfect.  Gabrielle will begin with the breath of fire and move forward.  When the ""energize"" section comes up you're ready.  Go!  Be fearless!  Move and breathe and awaken, activate every pore. If new to Kundalini be sure and rest between exercises (as Gabrielle suggests) in order to witness the many tingles!  The DVD is also beautifully filmed with lovely scenes of sunsets and ocean waters, finally complimented by a sensual and relaxing Savasana.  ""Healthy, Sexy, Beautiful"" is a wonderful addition to anyone's yoga DVD library!

8346557,5,B001VJTIUW,"Dr. Pelicci has put together a workout that is deceptively exhausting in an exhilarating way!
Clearly Part 3 has some demanding exercises, but overall she has put together a series of movements that are simple to perform and yet ask much of the body!

Dr. Pelicci also created a very engaging visual context for her workout. Her studio shots show a welcoming open space with just the right amount of color accents, and her beach scenes are calming and yet compellingly provocative in enticing one to really ""get into"" the movements!

This is a joyous workout that invigorates the body and satisfies the soul!",1259107200,2,608,4.836538461538462
8346558,5,B001VJTIUW,"This DVD, was the best decision I have made. The setting is so calming, after working the whole DVD 45 mins. I was so relaxed, and energized. After my first session I could instantly feel it's benefits. This DVD has changed how I view working out. It was purchased to add some energy to my yoga practice. I am new to yoga and have tapped into the benefits of breathing and getting intouch with my body. Yoga has given me great insight, I wish I would have had this DVD years ago. As a beginner I wasn't able to do every exercise, but she encourages for you to do at your own ability and work your way up.
Dr. Pelicci delivers a simple approach to Kundalini, I am looking forward to mastering the techniques. Thank you for making this DVD.",1251590400,2,738,4.2785714285714285
8346559,3,B001VJTIUW,"The program is led by Dr. Gabrielle Pelicci, Ph. D.  (According to her web site, ""Dr. Gabrielle"" earned her doctorate degree in humanities).  During this workout, Pelicci teaches via live instruction in a bright studio; she does not provide mirrored cueing.  As she performs the exercises, the camera flashes to scenes of her in several other settings, including an alternate studio, a daytime/dusk beach, and a city scene (other exercise videos which have used a similar approach include Cindy Crawford's A New Dimension and Karen Voight's Streamline Fitness).

The DVD case describes this as a rigorous, one-hour total body workout which helps produce emotional balance, mental clarity, and stress relief.  It is broken up into four 15 minute segments:  Part 1, the Warm-Up, is intended to stretch and lengthen the back, neck, legs, and torso; Part 2, Energize, is to work the legs, hips, thighs, and butt; Strengthen, Part 3, is said to define the abs, arms, shoulders, and back; and finally, Part 4 is the Meditation/Relaxation component.  In her brief introduction, Pelicci suggests that the exercises are appropriate for beginners, who can simply practice for a shorter amount of time, yet also challenging for more experienced Kundalini practitioners.  The Warm-Up (17 minutes) begins in a seated position with the traditional Kundalini yoga chant of Ong Namu Guru Dev Namu repeated three times.  Following this, Pelicci introduces the Breath of Fire (BOF), performed holding the arms at a 60-degree angle.  Next follows of series of seated poses, mostly moving the body back and forth over the legs in various directions.  The second half of the warm-up section focuses more on the upper body with shoulder shrugs, neck rolls, and a spinal twist, concluding with the stomach grind.  Part 2 begins on hands and knees for cat/cow; this moves into knee to nose on each side.  Pelicci then comes to standing, moving slowly and methodically through squats, arm circles, toe touches, side reaches, torso twists, reach up/forward bend, and finally, what she calls ""dancing""--simply kicking the feet out in front of you rapidly for about half a minute.  This segment is about 14 minutes total.

Whereas the first two sections of the workout are fairly basic---Pelicci generally moves at a pace that's easy to follow, and most of the exercises are appropriate for all levels--Part 3 raises the difficulty level quite a bit, as it includes very challenging core work while maintaining BOF throughout.  This segment finishes with a few more traditional hatha yoga postures, down dog, cobra, and child's pose, coming in at just under 14 minutes.  In the final 14-minute section, Pelicci sets you up for meditation, introducing the phrase ""Sat Nam"" but providing little other verbal instruction for the 6.5 minute seated session (and unfortunately, the music played during this segment includes drums that are quite jarring rather than relaxing).  This is followed by a 5-minute lying relaxation, and then Pelicci concludes the practice with a reclined twist and a brief prayer to finish.

Some might find this DVD to be a nice alternative option to the popular Ana Brett/Ravi Singh Kundalini yoga videos.  The workout does have some advantages, including Pelicci's down-to-earth instruction and the short mix-and-match segments.  However, I found the pace of the practice very uneven--ie, although the first, second, and even the last segments are all extremely accessible to beginners, the difficulty level of Part 3 is completely out of sync with the rest of the video.  Therefore, I would hesitate to recommend this DVD, especially to beginners; Pelicci does provide video clips on her web site, so that might be a good way to determine if this practice would be right for you.",1251504000,21,3776,5.155737704918033
8346560,5,B001VJTIUW,Really enjoyed this workout and it reminds me of the Cindy Crawford dvds which are some of my all time favorites.  But I do have to wonder why such a rip off here on Amazon with the $24.99 price when you can get this dvd from Gabrielle's site for only $14.99 ???,1247443200,15,262,4.038461538461538
