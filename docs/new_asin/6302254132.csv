442398,5,6302254132,"In the hands of joel schumacher and the acting lead of Adam Sandler, this romantic comedy would have been dumbed down to the level of a third grader and the nudity would have reached gratuitous proportions, but Michael J. Fox does a convincing job playing an upity young doctor who discovers that dreams take unexpected turns---sometimes for the better.
En route to Beverly Hills for his dream job, Benjamin Stone (Fox) gets punnished with community service after wrecking a farmer/judge's fence with his car. Fox carries out his sentence while his car is being fixed by two mechanics who act as if they have never seen anything other than a model T and hillarity ensues as city and country folk learn they have a lot more in commmon than previously thought.
Belieing the stereotypes of southern women, The ambulance driver Lou, is a feisty animal rights activist and single parent who is well-read. The romantic tension and chemistry between her and Fox is convincing.",986515200,2,969,4.914634146341464
442399,1,6302254132,"I loved this movie.
I was very disappointed when i watched it on dvd.
#1. it's not in letterbox, i guess i should have looked more  carefully at the description but when is the last time you saw a  semi-recent movie on dvd that didn't have a letterbox version?
#2. the  quality, it looks almost as if someone just pointed a camcorder at a tv and  recorded it and then threw it on dvd.
#3. extras - there are none, there  is nothing on this dvd but the movie.
 i was so bummed i didn't even  watch the whole thing. this is the first dvd i have bought that was a  letdown.",966816000,20,570,4.026785714285714
442400,4,6302254132,"This was the third DVD I ever bought, simply because it was inexpensive.  It is a wonderful movie with great characters, and I have watched it at least as often as any other DVD in my collection.  Very enjoyable.  Be  forewarned, however, that the DVD transfer quality is very poor.  The first  time I watched it, I was surprised when I saw ""lint"" on the  picture in some frames!  You can forgive that when you remember how little  you paid.",961632000,,441,4.4125
442401,5,6302254132,"The title immediately put me off. The star, Michael J Fox immediately put me off. But once I got past those 2 major obstacles and settled in, I found a little gem of a movie.
Fox's young doctor, all full of spit and  vinegar, sets off across country to medical nirvana: a highly sought  position in a prestigious Beverly Hills plastic surgery practice. On the  way, Doc Hollywood is waylaid in definitive small town USA, Grady Ga. on  the cusp of the annual squash festival.
Am I boring you? Likely, but this  film is never boring, a character driven comedy with superlative  performances in each and every nook and cranny-particularly David Ogden  Stiers (no Maj Winchester here) and Barnard Hughes. Woody Harrelson and  Bridget Fonda have smallish parts. Even George Hamilton is bearable in a  cameo.
Liked it so much, I headed out to find director Michael  Caton-Jones previous effort,  Memphis Belle.",950227200,7,904,4.881578947368421

Sad to say, they must have used the same copy for both transfers. It remains enjoyable.  The line to listen for is when Woody is in Hollywood and is asked (off  camera) ""Isn't that a movie star?""

442707,2,6302254132,"This movie had some feel-good scenes and some wit, which made some of it enjoyable.  But it definately had some saccharine and unrealistic things about it. The small town of Grady, South Carolina that Ben Stone (Michael J Fox) got stuck in seemed just so unrealisticly sugary to where it wasn't believable. Everybody was just so nice to everyone every minute, and so overly welcoming to Ben right from the start. Most small towns, even in the South, I seriously doubt are that ultra nice to outsiders, especially when him crashing into a fense is what initially got everyone's attention there. The towners of Grady acted a little more realistic at first, the court marshall and the judge, banging his hammer extending his sentence every time he opened his mouth. Right after that when they decided to appoint Ben the new doctor of Grady, almost everyone looked at Ben as a hero. The only others that didn't seem to look at Ben as the utmost high and mighty was nurse Packard at the doctors clinic who kept clocking him in and out like a factory worker, and the old doctor who resented a young snot-nosed puppy doctor (who Ben really acted like) taking over him. The Woody Harelson character almost looked like he was gonna be one of those manipulating hicks who resents some outsider being there (when he saw Ben and said ""who's the green apple?""), but then turned pretty nice. A scene later on where Woody started accusing Ben of being with his crush, Julie Warner, Ben assumes he's gonna now turn into an itching for a fight redneck and starts yelling at him challenging him, but Woody just sat there so calmly being really nice. How many real life local hicks would continue to be that nice to an outsider who just yelled at him menacingly and was also out with the girl he loved? Unrealisticly nice. Other unrealisticly nice characters were Bridget Fonda (cute but too saccharin, and thinks that the first thing to say to a new doctor is ""do doctors know more about sex than most people?""), Julie Warner (who walked naked in front of Ben the first time she saw him and was totally OK with it), the town mayor (who keeps telling Ben ""you'll like Grady once you give her a chance""), the guys fixing his car, the ladies that Ben stayed with (surprising him with tons of food, and seemed to really ogle over him), and many others that Ben meets.
I did like some of Julie and Ben's scenes when he was trying to get romantic with her. I also liked the old doctor and his reaction to Ben confusing a boy with indigestion for serious heart failure and trying to get the helicopter and to have him operated on, and I liked when Ben saved the old doctor's life when he had a heart attack. I kind of liked the scene with Ben getting the pig against his will and nurse Packard snapping at him to get his animal out of there. And Bridget Fonda was pretty, even if her character was daffy.
The other scene a bit dumb was when Ben got to L.A., his hiring cheif surgeon immediately hires him on the spot just because of a note from the small town doctor saying that he was an idiot if he didn't. Not realistic. A few other complete stereotypes in the L.A. sections included an airhead receptionist and a crying Indian taxi driver.
But, there were some enjoyable scenes in the main small town sections. Some.",1512950400,,3295,4.500834724540901

but they also reissued the film on dvd anyway under their warner archive collection
and there's no new extras on either format except for the original Theatrical trailer
but warners did make the effort to clean up the picture quality with new 1:85:1 HD transfer
which does look more sharper & clearer than the old dvd version so about 7-8/10 for picture quality
the sound quality is new 5.1 master mix which does sound alot better than the old Mono sound mix so about 5-6/10
the original trailer added for this new blu-ray has only been digitally remastered, not HD
as i said before warners also reissued the film on dvd again which has the same original trailer
the only difference is the picture quality is only 1:85:1 digital remaster, not HD
so i give about 2.5 stars for the blu-ray & dvd based on no new extras like a new interview with Michael J Fox would've been great

Speaking about attention, I'm not saying that Julie Warner is like Hedy Lamar; but they both where the same suit when they come out of the water (birthday.) And George Hamilton plays a similar character as he does in ""8 Heads in a Duffel Bag"" (1997). I am glad it is not one of those letterbox (have to look at the black lines) pictures. They are ok but distracting when not necessary.

Dr. Benjamin Stone is on his way to try out for a new job as a high paid plastic surgeon. Due to impedance in the road, he is forced to detour through a local fence. The fence just happened to be owned by the judge. When the judge finds out that Ben Stone is a doctor, he requires Ben to pay with community service and the story snowballs from there.

Will Ben stay in the one pig town or will he finally move on to the big city?

The packaging looks good, the disc has purple dye like a cheap burn, but there is a professional label attached and the packaging overall looks like any other DVD in my collection. I had no issues playing it. The only ""special"" is the original trailer. But the movie is indeed the WIDESCREEN transfer that we've been waiting for, and the picture looks good.

443688,5,6302254132,"DOC HOLLYWOOD is a color film, mostly taking place in a village in South Carolina.  The film begins with a short episode taking place a hospital in a big city on the east coast, and the film concludes with a short episode taking place in a plastic surgery clinic in Beverly Hills.  The main characters are Michael J. Fox (MJF), who is a young doctor, and Julie Warner, who plays the love interest.  One notable character actor is Roberts Blossom who plays a judge and who has a personality similar to that of Walter Brennan of The Real McCoys.  Blossom has acted in 20 films and dozens of televisions shows. Another notable character actor is, David Ogden Stiers, who plays the mayor of the village, and who is bent on recruiting MJF to become a permanent residence of the village.  Mr. Steiers has a huge resume, listing dozens and dozens of films and television shows, most notably, M.A.S.H.  Michael J. Fox, of course, is a household word.

SIMILAR THEME TO THAT IN A FEW OTHER FILMS.  The main theme of the movie is an outsider who happens to take residence in a tiny village, with little or no thought of becoming a permanent resident.  The same type of theme occurs in other movies, such as AS IT IS IN HEAVEN, which concerns an orchestra conductor who takes residence in a tiny village and who eventually directs the church choir, and NEW IN TOWN, starring Rene Zellweger and Harry Connick, which concerns an executive of a food company who takes residence in a village in Minnesota, and who eventually marries a factory worker in that village.  In DOC HOLLYWOOD, the outsider is MJF, and the tiny village is fictional, Grady, South Carolina.  I liked the film's accurate depiction of the Spanish moss, which dangles and sways from many trees.  Also, I liked the film's disclosure of southern cuisine.  On occasion, I detected authentic pronunciation of a ""southern accent"" but I am not able to affirm that the accent was authentic to South Carolina.  I do know for a fact, that the accent was NOT the accent that is unique to people from Charleston, South Carolina.  At any rate, I love this type of theme, and I very much admire DOC HOLLYWOOD, AS IT IS IN HEAVEN, and NEW IN TOWN, for their excellent use of this theme.

QUOTATIONS.  The following provides excerpts from the plot and dialogue.  Although I do NOT disclose the surprise ending, what is excellent about the movie is the clever dialogue and the suspense that is built up, regarding whether MJF will decide to move on to Beverly Hills, or to settle down in the South Carolina village.

BUSY BIG CITY EMERGENCY ROOM.  This is how the film starts.  ""I can't feel my arm,"" yells a patient in distress, as MJF strides through the emergency room of a big city hospital, on his way to his post.  MJF answers, ""I can't feel your arm right now either,"" and he continues to walk. In arriving at his post.  MJF says, ""What's the problem?""  ""Gunshot wound in the shoulder and abdomen, we've been paging you for five minutes,"" replies another doctor.""  ""Hey get this guy typed and crossed, huh,"" orders MJF.  Between bits of fast paced medical lingo, MJF reveals that he will be leaving in a week for a high paying job as a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills.  Then, another patient is wheeled in on a gurney.  ""Okay, what's the problem"" asks MJF.  ""Too much problem, substances unknown"" answers another doctor.  ""Okay, stay with us, hey"" says MJF to the patient, gently slapping the patient's cheeks and examining the patient's eyes with a pen light.""  ""Okay, what did you take man, huh?  Bluebirds?  Dilleys?  Loveboats?"" asks MJF.  The patient, lying flat, then rolls over and vomits copiously on MJF.

INTERSTATE 95 AND BACKROADS IN SOUTH CAROLINA.  In the next scene, MJF is busily motoring down Interstate 95 in his red Porsche Speedster.  But he encounters a traffic jam, caused by a road repair crew, and decides to take the back roads.  Once on the back roads, he encounters three cows in the middle of the road, being led along by two ladies.  MJF swerves to avoid them, and crashes into a picket fence, and comes to a stop in front of an elderly hillbilly (who is actually a judge) and a chubby policeman.  The hillbilly and the policeman are unfazed.  The chubby policeman refers to the Porsche, and calmly asks, ""Is that a 56 or a 57 Speedster.""  ""56"" replies MJF.  ""Took me three weeks to build that fence,"" complains the hillbilly."" ""Does this have a super 90 engine or a 1600,"" calmly asks the chubby policeman.  The hillbilly holds a brush and can of white paint.  ""Hey is this a Mazda,"" asks a mechanic, who just happened to pull up in his pickup truck.  ""Where's the dang engine,"" asks the mechanic, who had opened the hood of the Porche, not realizing that the engine is in the rear of the car just like a Volkswagen bug.

COURTROOM SCENE.  In the courtroom, the hillbilly presides.  He is actually the town's judge.  He wears a black robe, and in front of him is a plaque reading Judge Evans.  He proclaims, ""The court finds the defendant guilty of crimes under motor vehicle code 453-19 and 466-2 reckless endangerment.""  ""This is insane,"" exclaims MJF.  Judge Evans fines MJF thirtytwo hours of community service, which takes the form of volunteer labor in the understaffed local hospital.  ""I am f_cked,"" exclaims MJF.  Because MJF had just said the F-word, the policeman says, ""Watch your language, doc, you are in the buckle of the Bible belt.  You might try saying fudge.""  A few moments go by and MJF again comments on his situation by exclaiming, ""Sugar!""

RECURRING TOPICS.  Doc Hollywood is noted for a delightful assortment of recurring humorous topics.  These topics include the fact that gossip in the village moves at lightning speed.  Another topic is the subject of squash.  Yet another recurring topic is a pig named Jasmine.  Also, the film includes a fair number of homespun, small town issues, such as the phrase, ""insurance rebel without a clause,"" the need for MJF to keep track of his work hours in the hospital with a time card, friendship quilts, and adult illiteracy.

LOVE INTEREST.  Fifteen minutes into the film Julie Warner appears.  At first, she appears in a dream at nighttime that MJF is having.  She is topless in the dream and shown in silhouette.  But moments later, the morning comes, and MJF walks over to a nearby lake, and out of the lake comes a totally naked Julie Warner.  The movie camera dwells lovingly on her ta-tas, and most male viewers of this movie will likely experience a pleasant, ""Boing-oing-oing!""  As actress Julie Warner walks along the beach, she says, ""You can blink now.""  Julie Warner's daytime job is as ambulance driver for the small town, but she is also in law school, and is occasionally shown studying her law books.  At 39 minutes into the film, the ever so attractive and lyrical music from Prokofiev's Lieutenant Kiji Suite is heard, and this music is repeated at a couple of other spots in the movie.  The turning point of the movie occurs at 52 minutes.  MJF and Julie Warner in an automobile, engaging in intelligent chit-chat.  ""Honesty, that's a new approach,"" she says to MJF.  (I admire the film for this amusing and clever bit of dialogue.)  Then, Julie Warner makes the general comment, ""John Muir said it, most people are on the world, not in it."" From this expression, MJF realizes that Julie Warner is an intelligent and articulate woman, and it is clear that his love interest in her has just ratcheted up by a big notch.  MJF smiles broadly at her, just after she makes this comment.  Julie Warner also smiles broadly, and exclaims, ""What . . .""  (Please note that it is typical American expression to just say ""what?"" in the situation where you know that somebody is thinking or alluding to something pleasant or desirable, but is silent as to its nature.)  SPOILER ALERT.  Don't worry, I am not going to write any more.  The film continues with its clever and unique dialog and plot, but I do not disclose any more.",1442188800,2,7981,4.653543307086614

443873,2,6302254132,"I watched this movie after watching ""The Grand Seduction"" - a Canadian production, with a very similar theme,.set in a small fishing community in Newfoundland. In comparison to the Canadian film, which had wry humor and a cast of fascinating well-developed characters, I found the script of DH trite and cliche, with several fine actors wasted in stock-character roles. Michael J. Fox is one of my favorites -  but this was not one of his best roles in my opinion.",1433721600,,464,4.8
443874,5,6302254132,"I have to say, this is truly one of my favorite movies. It has a simple charm about it, along with tremendous secondary characters that make the community seems like an idyllic place. Michael J. Fox is funny in this to be sure, but the romanticism of the small town of Grady is the central theme of the film. This would be an interesting movie for a ""20 years later"" type of sequel.",1432857600,,382,4.2465753424657535

444211,5,6302254132,"I have owned a VHS version for many years.  The first time I saw Doc Hollywood I thought, ""Wow! That butt cake was really gross.""  But then something happened:  I began to visualize scenes from the movie such as the scene where the old Doc Hogue opens up the
beautiful dark cherry wood cabinet loaded with pictures of the 700 plus babies he'd delivered, and I was hooked.
This is the most charming and nostalgic movie I have ever seen.  I have watched it over 50 times and never tire of watching it. It warms my  heart and takes me away from this cold, sterile existence.
The characters are colorful and loveable, the scenery is beautiful, and the music and romance are magical and mysterious. Special praise for the musical score which leaves the viewer pleasantly haunted and yearning for
more.

444697,3,6302254132,"Just saw this again recently on T.V., had not seen it since it came out, I admit that this is not one of my personal favorites, don't know why, but, it has charm, while watching this again I kept wondering why Julie Warner (who plays Michael J. Fox's love interest) didn't go on to bigger & better things, I think she was on the show ""Family Law"", however this is a good romantic film, but I feel it could have been better, but that is just me, Woody Harrelson & Bridget Fonda are so underused here, plus Fox discovered he had Parkinson's Disease while making this film, there isn't much I can say that others haven't said, this one is a mixed bag for me, on the one hand you have small town people that are so stereo-typed that you wonder if this could be a Stephen King story, but on the other hand you have the romance between Fox & Warner that is so believeable & they have great chemistry, but for me there just seem to be somthing missing with this one, on a side note.....I do believe Julie Warner should have been Jennifer in ""Back to the Future II & III"" seeing that she looks so much like the original actress who played the character in the first ""Back to the Future"" film, who didn't return for the sequels, overall, a mediocre film, Fox was much better & funnier in ""Greedy""....but I will probably end up getting this one (maybe).",1403827200,,1343,4.312252964426878

444700,5,6302254132,"Watch what happens when an arrogant doctor, played by Michael J. Fox, on his way to the cushy life of a plastic surgeon in Los Angeles, gets sidetracked when he becomes stuck in the small (fictional) town of Grady, South Carolina.  There, he meets the quirky locals as he is forced to do community service at the local hospital after he accidentally mowed down the local judge's fence with his car (no, no conflict of interest whatsoever in this case...someone have an ethics book I can check to be sure?)  These include the jovial mayor, played by David Ogden Stiers, the stern judge, played by Roberts Blossom, and the local resident doctor, a veteran of the medical field played by Barnard Hughes.  As our doctor becomes more and more eager to leave, his mind may or may not be changed by the sight of the local ambulance driver, a pretty tom-boy played by Julie Warner. This was a funny film that thankfully never tried too hard.  It just told the story and let the jokes fall where they may.  I personally liked the older doctor very much...he was unconventional but knowledgeable, both about medicine and the town.  Believe it or not, I'd want a guy like him as my physician.  But Fox and Hughes worked well together and never tried too hard...their on-screen antagonism showed as a result.  I will just go ahead and recommend this film as it's nice for any Friday night where you just wanna stay home and kick back in front of your own big screen.  It's a Michael J. Fox classic.

That said, the production of this DVD is a huge fail.  I am a bit astounded that the old VHS version I have is actually better than this.

Doc Hollywood is a good all around movie.  Michael J.

They are well casted for their roles and change his opinion of going to a large city with more money to practice medicine to becoming a family doctor in a small community where  money is very low but friendship and people's lives are rich with variety and home style feelings.

You have Woody Harrelson in a hilarious role as an insurance agent and Bridget Fonda doing southern like no one should ever do again.

It is a classic fish out of water story.  Doctor is driving across the country to take a job in Los Angeles and gets stuck working at the hospital in a small town after destroying the town judge's fence.  It is totally absurd from a reality concept, but it is one of those stories that if you can suspend your disbelief on that part, you can enjoy the rest of it.  I think all the actors did a great job.  The great David Ogden Stiers was awesome as the mayor, but even all the supporting actors did well and brought something to the story.

Even though the story is predictable, and you can see where it is going from a mile away, the acting is great, and the story is told in a very entertaining way.  Like I said before, the DVD is very bare bones.  No features and not the best DVD transfer.

David Ogden Stiers as the Mayor is delightful.  Julie Warner's ""Lou"" has just the right combination of vulnerability and caution and you empathize with her when Ben leaves, even though you know this will work out.  The Judge, Nurse Packer, and the great Barnard Hughes are a package made in Hollywood heaven.

Small time old fashion life is presented so well that by the end of the movie I was wanting to be 'stuck' there as well.  The movie goes on to focus on the things that are really important in life.

My only complaint is that this movie is 90% clean and geared towards family viewing.  However for some reason, they decided to slip in several things that were not needed at all which gives it an R rating.  There are a couple uses of the 'f' word out of nowhere which does not fit the style of the rest of the movie and 1 totally unnecessary nude scene.  Other than that the movie is very clean and family oriented.

My other slight complaint is that the movie gears a little on the 'liberal' side with certain parts which again do not really fit with the rest of the movie or the Characters.  But this was not that big a deal.

445274,5,6302254132,"This is a gem of a movie, with Michael J Fox successfully pulling off a character that is full of contradiction -- arrogant, rude, humble, vulnerable, in command, embarrassed, cute, love struck, hurt, compassionate, abrasive, exposed, depressed, angry, and principled.  Fox masterfully pulls off all of these conflicting characteristics in a believable way.

His facial expressions are subtly humorous and memorable, and five of the six sections of dialogue between him and Julie Warner alone are charming, witting and riveting.

Every one of the supporting cast members give equally stellar performances, and the reasons for the various types of conflict in the story are believable and heart warming.

I'm surprised Julie Warner's career didn't go further after this, and I would've loved to see other romantic comedies starring both Fox and Wagner together, as we've seen with John Travolta and  Olivia Newton-John, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers etcetera.  There appeared to be chemistry between them that sets the television on fire every time I watch it.

I bought this video after checking it out from the library, and I expect it to be one of these videos I turn to when I want to lose myself in the world these two create for us.  And this in spite of the fact that I don't naturally gravitate to romantic comedies.

I have two criticisms of the movie -- one has to do with the lack of emotion that Warner sometimes shows during critical moments in her relationship with Fox -- for example, when they finally unite, she ends this kiss with the statement ""nice tonsils"".  While this was funny, I thought it sort of spoiled the moment and didn't do justice to the fact that fox had just given her unconditional love on her own terms.

And second, there is a scene where Fox and Warner start urinating all over different parts of a forest to deter deer from approaching a deer blind.  Initially, Fox reacts with confusion, which lends credibility to the scene (as this is exactly what I felt), but it seemed unfitting for Wagner's character, and hardly an experience that would trigger the affection and love for one another that eventually leads to their relationship blossoming.

But this is a minor criticism -- I know of no other movie that has had such a riveting effect on me, and I think it's one that belongs in just about any collection.",1199923200,,2352,4.82089552238806

I really enjoy this movie, but I will not buy a 4:3 movie that wasn't shot originally in this format. As of Feb. 2009, standard analog (and I hope most 4:3 content) will migrate to widescreen/HD TV.

This is a wonderful movie, with a great cast, fine acting, nice cinematography, and a satisfying plot.  Fox, Warner, Fonda, and Harrelson are all wonderful in their roles, as are the supporting players.  I want to say that up front because I have some critical things to say about the mind set behind the film.

So many of the actors in this film have played Northern roles that I often expect one of them to blurt out, ""Can't get theyah from heeya.""  The script has fun with typical stereotypes; the worst redneck in the film, Woody Harrelson, only wants to sell the city boy insurance (which, funnily, might be worse than a beating).  This may be the Deep South, but it's a Hollywoodized version that contains illiteracy and pigs and a squash parade on the one hand and a woman who's studying for the bar plus mechanics who know their way around the insides of a vintage Porsche on the other.  In the end, despite the trappings, Grady is really Small Town, Anywhere.  And that serves the movie's purpose well, since what we learn from Ben Stone's sojourn in Grady is that many of us yearn for our culture's small town roots, where everyone knows everyone else, where the doctor makes house calls and the nice lady at the breakfast joint knows what each of her patrons wants without being told.  We like to have this side of our nature petted and stroked by movies even though, as a society, we have frantically voted and bought our way toward having the exact opposite kind of country.  (Where would WalMart fit into the lives of Gradyites?  MacDonald's?  We aren't told.) A movie like this, with the kind of values it supposedly emphasizes, can make us forget the choices we've made that have all but extinguished many of the Gradys in America.

Watch for a scene right out of Local Hero in which Fox listens to the weather forecast for Grady on his phone while looking out on LA city lights.  The parallels are too obvious, even so far as both Mac and Ben driving Porsches.  Local Hero might be seen as the pattern for this film, but with more of an ambiguous ending, and it is a bit more pragmatic about our chances of living the kind of life valued in Doc Hollywood; we don't know whether Mac ever makes it back to that tiny Scottish hamlet, whereas we get our dose of comfort at the climax of this film when Ben makes the ""right"" choice in the end.  So we do feel good after watching this movie, and for most folks that's what movies are for.  But do the values portrayed in the film make us want to preserve the Gradys and Bedford Falls we seemingly long for?",1185840000,,2584,4.463829787234043
445279,4,6302254132,"This is one of my favorite Michael J. Fox movies. Two of the biggest shames to me- Michael J. Fox getting struck down in full stride of his career, and Julie Warner being absolutely wasted after this movie and ""Mr. Saturday Night."" I fell in love with her. She displays why that's so easy in this movie, overflowing with her easygoing, charming natural approach on the screen. And Fox, who plays her romantic interest as an out of town Doc on his way to the west coast, is outstanding. Many found the premise of him as a young doctor stuck in a small town to ""pay his dues"" a little too much of a stretch. More than a high school kid who flies a DeLorean back to the future? Fox is as polished as ever, displaying the wealth of experience he'd accrued up to this point in his career, giving a performance better than that of some of his most beloved movies. The ensemble cast is great at accentuating the small town feel that can thrown an anchor on any city-slicker in a hurry to elsewhere. You feel this small town that is the backdrop to this unassuming light hearted romance. Great contributions from the entire cast, right up to George Hamilton's chuckling cameo.

445314,5,6302254132,"Too often, Hollywood directors seem to forget that cinematic success comes in the form of great characters.  Doc Hollywood, though, is one of those films that proves the rule.  This movie is chock full of great characters, even in some of the smallest of roles - and it's not just the people, for the small town in which the story takes place is quite a character unto itself.  The town of Grady is sort of an updated version of Mayberry - idyllic, of course, but nonetheless charming and evocative.  It's the kind of place you can only find in the South.

Of course, Dr. Ben Stone (Michael J. Fox) has blinders on when he first arrives.  Having just left the hustle and bustle (and blood) of a large D.C. hospital, he's on his way to La La Land in hopes of snagging a cushy job in the lucrative practice of cosmetic surgery.  On his cross-country drive, he gets as far as South Carolina before fate steps in, leaving Stone temporarily stuck in the small town of Grady with a banged-up sports car and a judge's sentence of thirty-two hours of community medical service.  Grady is in great need of a new doctor to replace the aging Dr. Hogue (Barnard Hughes), and everyone in town (well, almost everyone) - from the mayor (David Ogden Stiers) to the official welcoming committee of ladies and on down to the local farmers - makes no bones about their hopes of enticing him to stay.  Even the glory of the annual squash festival can't do much to equal the scales, though, as California promises fortune and excitement, while a practice in Grady promises only a barely decent salary and quiet, country living.  Predictably, though, Stone finds love - or at least the prospect for love - with the local ambulance driver.  He and Lou (Julie Warner), a single mother and aspiring law student, engage in a lot of mutual flirtation, but she quickly becomes something much more than a mere conquest for Stone, which makes his decision whether to stay in Grady or snatch the gold ring in California much more difficult than he ever would have thought.

With the help of a fantastic cast, Grady quickly begins to feel a lot like home for the viewer.  With just a little interaction here and there, you really come to know a vast number of people - the mayor, the local mechanic, the judge, old Doc Hogue, the implacable Nurse Packer, the illiterate family who depends on the doc to read them the family letters they receive, and the list just goes on.  Two of the faces are particularly recognizable: Woody Harrelson plays Lou's would-be suitor, and Bridget Fonda (whom I have long adored, despite the fact that she's a Fonda) plays the mayor's daughter, a young lady who longs for the bright lights of a big city.  David Ogden Stiers, I have to say, is just wonderful as the mayor; he's the exact antithesis of the Bostonian intellectual he played for so many years on M*A*S*H.  I can't say that all of these actors and actresses sounded all that Southern, but it's not their fault that they weren't lucky enough to be born here in the South.

You might be thinking this sounds like just another story about a city slicker won over by the charms of small-town living.  Doc Hollywood could easily have been just another boring version of an old story, but this film has a special quality that turns it into so much more than a predictable comedy.  Thanks to nuanced directing, rich storytelling, and wonderful acting, more than a few of these characters have a remarkable depth that you pick up on very quickly.  Grady isn't just a town; it's a way of life, with a genuineness you don't often find in any kind of film.  Stone's ultimate decision does not come down to anything as simple as romance vs. money.  Certainly, his feelings for Lou are deep and genuine, but the town of Grady and all of her citizens sing a siren song of love that Stone hears, as well.  As for that ending, it doesn't play out exactly in the manner you might expect, and that's just one more reason to love this wonderful movie.",1152316800,5,3994,4.5474860335195535

This was Fox's last movie, in a string of innocent romantic romps, that carried him through the Eighties.

  Fox plays Benjamin Stone, a young doctor bound for plastic surgery wealth in Beverly Hills, when he gets into a car accident in the fictional town of Grady South Carolina. While he fulfills his community service sentence due to the accident, he meets all of the stereotypical inhabitants of small town America, ala The Andy Griffith Show. The supporting cast is well chosen and full of recognizable faces. In the end, Fox's character must choose between Beverly Hills or Grady, with the answer being quite predictable.

Having lived in the South for the last 4 years I can appreciate this movie more than when I saw it first when it was released in theaters. The accent of the characters in the movie is really thick, though, and the DVD could definitely use sub-titles, at least in English, but it does not have any. In fact there are zero special features here, the main menu does not even have the standard background with a movie still but a giant WB logo with two options: Play and Chapter Index. Some production notes would have been nice too.",1092528000,4,594,4.409090909090909
445356,5,6302254132,"I normally cannot watch movies on airplanes for some reason.  I first saw ""Doc Hollywood"" on the grueling Boston-LA flight, and it immediately captured and held my interest for the entire flight.  More than anything, that fact illustrates that this is a truly engaging flick.  This is a genuinely funny movie.  One thing that this movie does is lay to rest any doubts anyone might have had about Michael J. Fox's acting ability. In my opinion he turns in a stellar performance, albeit supported by fine jobs by the supporting cast.  The part where he finally goes to LA is absolutely hysterical, by the way.
The story is very simple (no spoilers here).  The protagonist (Michael J. Fox) is on his way to a job interview for a position as a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills.  He has an accident in a small Southern town (""Grady"") and is sentenced to several hundred hours of community service.  The town needs a doctor, and its real purpose is to recruit him as a permanent resident physician.  Naturally, Doc meets a nice girl and now the choice is between money as a big-shot LA plastic surgeon and lifestyle in a nice rural setting.  There's a lot more.  I won't spoil it for you.  Doc's slow assimilation into the town of Grady is wonderfully done.  This movie manages to be both touching and funny, and I say this as one who is normally not much for comedy or date flicks.
Michael J. Fox shows in this movie that he had the potential to go far, as indeed he did.",1082764800,28,1466,4.486792452830189

445358,5,6302254132,"If you live in a big city and have also lived in a small town, you'll love this movie.  The cast is great.  Michael J. Fox and Julie Warner make great movie chemistry.

445359,4,6302254132,"When future film critics decide to analyze the career of Michael J. Fox, they will likely say his talents were best suited to television, with an acknowledgement that he did star in the BACK TO THE FUTURE series. This will be a shame, as Fox has been an ingratiating, very enjoyable actor to watch, in most of his films, and DOC HOLLYWOOD is one of his best roles.
As breezy, fast-talking Washington, D.C. surgeon Dr. Ben Stone, who dreams of making big money doing plastic surgery in Hollywood, but finds his true calling as a general practitioner in a small southern hamlet, Fox is so 'right' that you can't imagine any other actor in the role. After a minor traffic accident enroute to California forces him to do 'public service' in fictional Grady, South Carolina, taking on much of the workload of a crusty old local physician (the always enjoyable Barnard Hughes), Stone becomes the 'talk' of the town, and rustic but wise Mayor Nick Nicholson (David Ogden Stiers, in one of his most engaging performances), starts 'selling' the joys of country life to the cosmopolitan young doctor. A quilt with 'magical' powers provides a nude vision of the girl he's destined to love, 'Lou' (Julie Warner), who turns out to be working at his office; his hormone-fueled pursuit of her, and her pragmatic 'indifference' to his flirtations make their gradual romance edgy and fun to watch.
In a town full of colorful characters, two 'stars in the making' stand out; Woody Harrelson, as 'Lou's' suitor, Hank Gordon, a country variation of his bartending character from 'Cheers', talks dumb but has a knack for selling, only lacking a place to make big money at it; and Bridget Fonda, as Mayor Nicholson's oversexed but 'out of place' daughter, hopes Stone will take her away to the bright lights of Hollywood. Both stars are terrific in their supporting roles, and show the charisma that would lead them to stardom.
DOC HOLLYWOOD is full of charming vignettes, from Stone vicariously reading the mail for an illiterate farm couple, to being paid for services rendered with a rather large pig, who ultimately becomes his 'pet'. The film abounds in warm comic touches that are guaranteed to bring a smile!
With a very funny cameo by George Hamilton, as the Hollywood plastic surgeon Stone dreams of working with, DOC HOLLYWOOD hits all the right notes for a terrific entertainment. My only complaint about the film is that it was actually filmed in Florida; as a South Carolina resident, I can attest that MANY of our small towns could have doubled quite nicely for Grady...
DOC HOLLYWOOD is a film I'm proud to have in my collection!",1067212800,28,2622,4.815964523281597
445360,5,6302254132,"Julie Warner, for me, was the highlight of the movie. I believe she was 25 when she filmed her role as Lou the ambulance driver. A gorgeous woman; especially in the diner (first encounter with Ben Stone). I have read through all the reviews and I had to post my own because someone discredited Julie Warner as an actress. I believe she did an outstanding job.
The film is great to enjoy over and over. I am content with my VHS copy. I won't buy the DVD because of all the negative reviews.
The movie takes place in a small, rural town in South Carolina (really filmed in Florida). It is a classic boy-meets-girl story. I won't rehash what most people have said thus far as to the overall story.
I thoroughly enjoyed Barnard Hughes' role as Dr. Aurelius Hogue. He was the grandfather in The Lost Boys, in Blossom (TV series) and played in numerous other roles. A fine actor. He added so much to this film, I cannot begin to say.
I can and have watched this film numerous times. A great treasure to own. I enjoyed it the first time I saw it in the theater and the many times I have seen it since purchasing it.
The movie is great, but the DVD is bad. So, I am giving it a 5 as a movie.",1062720000,4,1183,4.170305676855895

445406,5,6302254132,"There are two points that you should note before you buy this DVD. First, there is one nude scene. Second, the production quality has not been enhanced, and there are no special features on this DVD.
HOWEVER, I love this movie. Michael J. Fox is hilarious as well as convincing. The supporting cast is beautifully quirky, deceptively complex and interesting. There is a stunning contrast between the Washington DC hospital where Dr. Stone completes his training (violent & tumultuous), the small southern town that he is trying to escape (serene & friendly) and the LA plastic surgery practice that he wants to join(cold & impersonal).
While serving as the small town's GP, he learns through his interactions with the locals that living in a peaceful town is a quality of life choice - not a horrible fate for those that don't know better. I can watch this one over and over.",1046563200,6,875,4.801324503311259

That aside, should you buy this?  Yes!
Doc Hollywood is one of those movies that keeps you coming back for more.  It's so well written and so well acted, you can't help but want to know these characters better.  Fox and Warner are terrific and have good chemistry while David Ogden Stires nearly steals the show as the flolksy, down-to-earth mayor.  This is indeed a picture for everyone.
Don't let the DVD's shortcomings put you off, it's perfectly viewable and enjoyable.  This is the only way you can get this film right now and, after all, the price is right.",1028160000,5,765,4.421428571428572

The picture is extremely dark in the hospital scene in the beginning.  Then there is a lot of grain and I've seen wood with less grain.  The grain makes the scene even darker then it should be.  Then when he's out of the hospital and on the road, the grain is still very noticeable.  I love the movie, but this DVD is just horrible.  Sadly there aren't any features on the disc either, so buying the VHS is so much better if you actually like this movie.

Fox loses his way in the Carolinas as he travels to Lotus Land for a new job as a plastic surgeon. A good movie to remind you what is important in life - pigs, kudzu, and a Porsche Speedster. It is such a lovely little film that the DVD presentation should be a crime. The picture quality is horrible and it is not letterboxed. No trailers, director's comment (which would have been GREAT), or added features. Just the movie, nothing extra. It appears some distributor's ten-year-old son was learning to burn a DVD for the first time and was given this as a project. Somebody should be ashamed. It's like serving a Heineken in a dirty baby bottle. Warner Brothers clearly dropped the ball on this. Loved the movie. Hated the DVD.",1020384000,67,916,4.491017964071856

I thought he would enjoy it and it would lift his spirits.  However, since the closed captioning did not work, he missed the jokes, the subtleties, and a lot of the story line.  We turned the sound up all the way, which was uncomfortable for others in the room, but the sound was so uneven that much of the dialog was still inaudible to Dad.
Closed captioning is LISTED on the menu, but is not accessible.  When the disc menu is on the screen, the ONLY accessible options are ""start movie"" and ""jump to scene.""  It is impossible to move the cursor to the left side of the screen and click on ""closed captioning.""  I have watched many, many DVDs on many different DVD players.
