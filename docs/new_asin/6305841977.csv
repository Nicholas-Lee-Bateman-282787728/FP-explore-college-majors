1085173,2,6305841977,"Though this wretched movie is not the nadir of Richard Burton's career (check out ""The Klansman"" for that dubious distinction), it comes mighty darn close. The script, the acting and the general tone of this movie is beyond repulsive, it is tawdry, inane and ultimately, quite pathetic. However, there is one overwhelmingly redeeming feature to ""Bluebeard:"" it is so bad it is unintentionally hilarious!
Burton sleepwalks through this silly film with a cheap, stick-on goatee. As always, he overacts to a ridiculous degree and one eternally wonders why his directors never took him aside and said, ""Richard, you don't need to scream every single line."" Alas, Burton is magnificently dreadful here, his attempts at lovemaking become bombastically embarrassing to watch, his few, brief attempts at some decent acting are wickedly futile. One real-life moment to ponder: following one love scene with one of the no-name Italian starlets, the director yelled, ""cut!"" but Burton and the starlet continued kissing and then walked off the set to Burton's waiting limousine. Hmmm, where was Liz?
This is a great movie to enjoy with a few beers and a readiness to make fun of every scene and hurl collective invective against Richard Burton. If you are up to the challenge, then ""Bluebeard"" is your movie.",1036972800,16,1296,5.1469194312796205
1085174,5,6305841977,"Burton plays Baron Kurt Von Sepper, a wealthy Austrian upper crust aristocrat with a dark blue beard. He marries Greta (Karin Schubert), but she dies in a tragic hunting ""accident."" He meets street smart American showgirl, Anne (Joey Heatherton, who has a semi nude scene) and marries her after a whirlwind romance. One night alone at the Baron's palace Anne makes the ghastly discovery of a secret freezer chock full of former wives.  Smart Anne tries to buy time before she becomes the newest addition to the freezer by convincing Bluebeard to tell her how all the women met their fates.  He starts to tell her the tale of how each former wife met her fate.
Before I go any further, let me say that this film is overdone, campy, and sometimes, well, bad.
But that is what makes it fun.
The various ways that Bluebeard got rid of his other wives is absolutely hilarious. Virna Lisi, Nathalie Delon (along with her lesbian lover Sybil Danning), Raquel Welch, Marilu' Tolo, and Agostina Belli all die in some very interesting and campy ways.  This is fiendishly fun black comedy at it's over the top best.

1085231,2,6305841977,"Before watching ""Bluebeard"", I expected a campy, trashy, and entertaining film. It certainly was trashy, campy at times, but not really entertaining. But, let's start with the good things: The film is very nice looking, with great, campy set designs,  Ennio Morricone's soundtrack is very good and there's also some nice 1920s music such as the Charleston. The movie is reviewed in the excellent book ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bad-Movies-We-Love/dp/0452270057/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bad Movies We Love</a>"". The authors panned Heatherton's performance but I thought she was pretty good. Richard Burton gives a routine performance and it's always nice to see Raquel Welch, although she, despite getting second billing, only has a small role.

What makes ""Bluebeard"" a disappointment for me is the story, or rather, the story structure. It starts with Burton marrying a girl, who's then killed in a hunting ""accident"". He then marries American night club dancer Joey Heatherton. It's not long before Heatherton finds a number of Burton's ex-wives in a freezing room in his castle. Burton tells her since she knows his secret he'll have to kill her too, and proceeds to tell about his previous wives and how he killed them. These are told in flashbacks and while there are some good scenes, it's very slow paced and it's not long before it starts to get pretty dull to watch. I think the movie could have been pretty good if they'd trimmed it down about 20 minutes or so. I also wish the filmmakers could have decided what type of movie they wanted to make. Apart from drama ""Bluebeard"" has elements of horror, thriller and comedy, but it doesn't really succed as any of it.",1288483200,3,1720,5.228260869565218

( Perhaps ""The Wild Geese"" could be an exception. )  I loved this move.  It made me laugh over and over again.  And the women were wonderful and beautiful.  Raquel Welch was stunning.  She alone was worth the watch. However I have to say that Joey Heatherton made this movie for me.  She was never the best actress on the big or small screen.  BUT if she is not the sexiest I will eat my hat.  Girls today wish they had the sex appeal, even one tenth of the sex appeal that Ms. Heatherton carried with her.  WOW!  How I miss the days of my youth ogling and drooling over Joey Heatherton.  This movie reminded just how twitterpated she got me as a very young man just beginning to notice women. Perhaps I should say just beginning to notice what women like Joey Heatherton could do to me.  I didn't understand it then but I sure do now and wish I had many more movies of her.

Anyway. I say buy this movie and watch it over and over again and enjoy every second of it.  The could try a remake of this movie and in today's world they may make it seem better with special affects, but they will never improve on the fun and enjoyment one receives form watching this movie with this cast.  It is simply the best.

1085236,2,6305841977,"This mash-up of Gothic chills, soft-core 70s Euro-porn, sex farce and political satire is too knowing to be camp, but it sure does try to be awful.  I guess there's some satirical equation of misogeny and fascism, but by the time we get to the nymphomanical nun and the feminist who becomes orgasmic when slapped and whipped, its hard to get much enjoyment.

If any actor was worse suited to this kind of send-up it seems to be Burton.  He brings a virility to the role, but none of the game, self-parody that Vincent Price showed in similar outings.  (There's one scene of his disgust at one wife's naming of her body parts that raises a laugh, but nothing else.  Plus, he dispenses with his accent for whole scenes.)

Of the wives Nathalie Delon and Racquel both look great, and while Joey seems to have wandered in from Love, American Style she's not exactly bad.

Incidentally, animals were harmed during the making of this movie. There's a hunting scene that's bound to disturb, where we watch about half a dozen dispatched",1210032000,2,1028,4.6464088397790055

1085239,4,6305841977,"(3.5/5 stars) Here's a little oddity from the early 70's. Richard Burton plays Austrian Baron Kurt von Sepper, a hero during World War One, whose wealth, fame and good looks make it very easy for him to attract beautiful, young women. Little do they realize that he is one sadistic and misogynistic man, whose hatred of Russians, Communists and unions is matched only by his propensity to use violence as a solution against his perceived threats. (Sounds like the ideal match for Ann Coulter, doesn't he?) When workers begin to organize into a union, he dispatches some of his Nazi compatriots to burn, pillage and likewise intimidate the mostly Jewish laborers. To claim that he suffers from various neuroses and psychoses would be to state the obvious. One of the roots of these is his mommy issues, which are manifested by keeping his mother's decaying corpse in one of the rooms of his mansion. Another cause of his troubles lies in a secret, which he tries to keep from the women in his life. The secret is not revealed until the end of the movie, though most viewers will have figured it out long before that. Although the plot makes the film sound like it belongs in the thriller or perhaps suspense genres, it actually plays more like a very dark comedy with some social commentary thrown in. I'm not entirely convinced that was the goal from the onset because it is neither clever enough to succeed very well as a black comedy nor serious enough to work as a straightforward drama. Some of it, such as Raquel Welch's role, was definitely intended to be funny; however, several of the funniest parts come during the most dramatic moments. It is either a brilliantly executed comedy or a woefully inept attempt at satire. Either way, it is a tremendous amount of fun and I recommend it highly. Richard Burton is a hoot as the sadistic Baron and the women in the film are all quite attractive. Joey Heatherton gets to show off her dancing skills, her acting... um, ability and her other... uh, talents (which are two reasons for the `R' rating). Of note is the production by the father and son team of Alexander and Ilya Salkind, who would go on to produce the Christopher Reeve Superman films. Also of note is the quality of Lionsgate's DVD production, which is quite good. The picture is crisp and letterboxed, the colors are vibrant and there are optional subtitles. 3/5 stars for the film; 4/5 stars for the DVD",1200528000,11,2421,4.672131147540983
1085240,3,6305841977,"Richard Burton was one of those actors who just couldn't be bothered to show any discrimination in what roles he picked as long as he got a paycheck (and maybe a bottle of good Scotch and a comely starlet into the bargain).  When he was good, he could be great; when he was bad, he could be a real gas.  Consider ""Bluebeard"", where Burton plays the legendary killer of beautiful women while wearing one of the silliest stage beards of all time.  It's a perfect example of the big-budget bad movie.  The director couldn't seem to decide whether to make a Big Statement about Nazism (Burton's Bluebeard is a pseudo-Nazi leader, who probably would have been an actual Nazi except that the production ran afoul of German laws prohibiting the use of Nazi regalia in entertainment and had to use clumsy substitutes) or smack his lips over Bluebeard's seductions and murders of six gorgeous wives (and one lovely but unfortunate girlfriend of one of the wives).  It ends up being unintentional and rather smutty black comedy.

Actually, I need to rethink the phrase ""big budget""; the production apparently didn't have the money to be able to keep the actresses around to impersonate corpses in the Big Scene where Joey Heatherton, playing Bluebeard's latest wife (an American flapper who makes one glad that the Roaring Twenties ended with the Crash of '29) discovers the frozen bodies of the previous entries in the Wife-of-Bluebeard Sweepstakes.  What she actually sees when she opens the door of Bluebeard's cleverly hidden freezer are seven department-store mannequins inexpertly dressed up to look like the previous victims.  If they were able to get Karin Schubert to play dead for the disturbingly necrophilia-themed scene where Burton takes photos of her body as it lies laid out for her funeral, surely they could have collected the various actresses together to have them imitate Popsicles for this key scene.  It's emblematic of how clumsy this production is.

Do yourselves a favor and Google for bad-movie maven Jabootu's review of ""Bluebeard"". It's a classic and says just about everything else I could have said here.  Or you could, if you have a DVD player capable of playing Region 2 discs, look for the Italian comedy ""Le sei mogli di Barbablu"", which stars rubber-faced comedy legend Toto and features Sophia Loren in one of her very first roles.

7896972,3,6305841977,"Ok, it is a horror film. Don't expect a complex story or acting like you'd find in many other films starring these actors.
I saw it when it came out in the theaters back in the day. I, like everyone else, liked Raquel.
It's difficult to believe that this became a highly sought after cult film. But hey, it is!
The actors did their best. Burton knows how to pose himself as this strange character. Joey is terrific. Sadly, the film at the time was panned and so her career suffered from that. But she is great: playing first, naive, then humoring the man who desires to kill her, the, turning and taking him to task for his vile actions.
The other actresses are in short vignettes. All of their behaviors are exaggerated as these are the recollections of Bluebeard.  In my opinion, all the actors did very well. And have no doubt, all of the ladies look beautiful!
The directing is fine, the cinematography is very good. The color is FANTASTIC!

7896974,4,6305841977,"Fabulously mounted but not always joyous quasi-adaptation of the legendary fairy tale villain's biography (this is NOT Charles Perrault, just in case you are wondering) features a tiresome but stern Richard Burton soaking up the scenery (this movie's eye-filling buxom ladies, I mean) and murdering every wife he manages to seduce--is he impotent or just insane? Or both? Most likely you won't really care, because it's the outdoor scenery and the beautiful (and international) cast of drool-worthy women that make Dmytryk's ""Bluebeard"" such a visual delight. Richard Burton never accepted the best acting roles for his career, but boy he sure knew which parts were going to have the most sexy women (just think about how many gorgeous females were in this guy's pictures)! Other than a ""tutorial"" scene (involving the luscious Sybil Danning) that ends in a grisly fashion, there is not an excess of sexual situations in the movie, but there is nudity, and of course if you're offended by anything it will probably be Burton's personality as this character (or his acting). The original fairy tale (folk tale) was a misogynistic warning to newly wedded wives to keep their noses out of their husbands's business (because he is probably up to some sneaky, private affairs, and it's best if women don't know about it-but it's okay, because he is a man and he has a right to be nasty!), and this film is equally misogynistic in tone (women and animals are mistreated equally). Therefore, it's difficult to say how this film might play before an audience today, but I suspect that there may be a few raised eyebrows (if not walk-outs) during the screening. (Of course, to me, being offended by randy material in a fiction film is the equivalent of getting pissed off when someone puts an extra dollop of ice cream onto your cone, but that's just my jollies talking.) Although as a movie it's best to appreciate it for the beautiful women and camera work, on a side point I have to say that the screenwriters didn't do a very good job at filling in the biography of the Bluebeard figure. Audiences still do not get a real clue as to why he possesses such out-of-date ideals and has to exercise a sense of brutal control (although the writers hint at the fact that he has Norman Bates-like mother issues, the opportunity to create an inventive fictional biography of the character was lost, and therefore again it becomes a simple film that one watches mainly for the ladies on display).
This DVD looks gorgeous--it's Lionsgate's typically wonderful picture and sound transfer, and this is a good Widescreen print indeed, especially for a 1972 picture. There is a scene of animal slaughtering near the beginning (by a hunting party) that nearly put me off, but the surplus of beautiful women coming after it saves the picture--but Burton and the rest appear to be hard on animals, so know that before you watch this (I'm sensitive to this aspect of movies, although I believe the killings were simulated). Richard Burton is not, in my opinion, a good actor, but he is watchable here simply because of the ladies that surround him. Heatherton, Welch, and the rest all do fairly well in my opinion. The reason people seem upset about this picture is because they can't get the tone of it, but make no mistake about it this is a satire pure and simple (anyone who tries to take Burton's performance seriously is in for a rough ride). Watch it as such and stop expecting it to be riotously funny and you may enjoy it (but know that it is a saucy picture for its time--at least for a mainstream film). Sadly, the DVD features no audio commentary by a historian or no making of piece, all of which would have better served to situate this movie in its appropriate historical context. Nonetheless, with a cast of beautiful women like this, it feels trite to complain about such! It might be an example of lurid kitsch, but for a high quality print of this movie on DVD this is the one to own.",1423699200,,3979,4.718390804597701

The movie is campy/awful. It starts off as a serious film, then turns into a Mel Brooks adaptation, then back to serious. For example, one of his wives was always singing, and that's why he killed her. Another was an ex-nun. The bodies of his wives are nothing more then window display manniquins.
