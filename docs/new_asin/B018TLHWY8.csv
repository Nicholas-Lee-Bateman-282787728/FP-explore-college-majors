7554639,3,B018TLHWY8,"Interesting just for the WOW factor, if nothing else. However, the medical claims are dubious to dangerous. This movie is actually a lecture slide show, made by an amateur, and at some point transferred to the group of people who follow this guy's lectures. It includes homeopathic advice bordering on alchemy, a splash of Mahayana Buddhism, and New Age mysticism. Some of the advice includes drinking colloidal gold and platinum. (Which is for sale by several manufacturers on Amazon.) Also colloidal iridium is recommended. We have 20 parts per TRILLION of iridium in the body. As for absorption, iridium doesn't bind with much except platinum, so the body won't absorb it. Since he's really into the homeopathic ideals, he recommends diluting a teaspoon of colloidal gold into a cup of water, taking a drop of that water, putting it into another cup of water, and then using a drop of that water. (Normal dose for gold would be a tablespoon of two, once or twice a day, of the stuff BEFORE dilution.) Anyway, you hear about this idea of one molecule is all you need, in homeopathic remedies, so ......who knows. The bizarre ""factoids"" this guy spits out, are great for a laugh. (At one point, did I actually hear him say that iridium is a common mineral in the brain WTF?) He also spends a lot of time chanting a Sanskrit poem for healing, that is supposedly connected to the medicine Buddha. I'm a little disappointed he didn't get into how color effects healing, or sound waves independent of speech. It's not that I don't care for eastern thinking, or can't comprehend the weird and far out. In fact, i'm on board with that. Some of the medical advice, and his factoids are so erroneous, that he could cause harm. I am NOT on board with that.",1472083200,11,1748,4.678571428571429

I really liked the first one though",1466121600,4,131,3.7142857142857144

7554647,1,B018TLHWY8,"This guy is really awful. He makes very huge leaps with data, correlating data together as causal when they are in fact not related or at best not KNOWN to be related. He is also misinformed about history. He is not an enlightened individual and would not recommend this to anyone since it provides a lot of false information as facts. While the truths he did find are good, he came up with a lot of bad information to justify it. Watch Inner Worlds Outer Worlds 4 part series instead for actual truths and scientific facts.",1465171200,5,524,4.46875

8742977,1,B018TLHWY8,like other reviewers have said this is propaganda bs about selling snake oil. Also it is a powerpoint presentation and not a documentary. Seems like amazon is littered with these videos lately.,1500163200,,194,5.09375
8742978,5,B018TLHWY8,"Information = 5 stars.
Media format = 1 star.

Why????

This is a video of a presentation given at a conference. So, it's not documentary-quality as the cover leads you to believe and a dry format. However, the information is VERY ENLIGHTENING and fascinating, and links several recently rediscovered ancient concepts about the science and biology behind spirituality.  I can't wait to purchase obsidian, gold, and quartz crystals in order to capture the sun's energy. The parabolic gold mirror is on my list, too. Unfortunately, I don't think an emerald or ruby will be feasible for a while. I can't wait to get in touch with my inner Egyptian priestess!!!",1497484800,,657,4.954545454545454
