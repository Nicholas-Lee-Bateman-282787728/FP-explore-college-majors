8091426,2,B000BRBA74,"HIT ME is one of those films that does not even try to impose any underlying logic to support its paper thin plot and weasly characterizations.  I like to play casino blackjack and that was the only reason I rented this indie quickie.  Certainly there was no one of repute in the cast.  Camden Brady is Alicia Barzun who hires two rookies, one of whom is a math genius, to win millions counting cards in Vegas.  She is blond and busty, which is the only reason I gave it more than one star. Dan Herzhod is the math whiz who does not quite grasp the dangers involved in getting involved with such a risky scheme when the schemer brings nothing to the table but brassiness and sleaze.  Since I am familiar with most of the rules of casino conduct, I could spot the holes in the plot, not the least of which was Herzhold's betting more than two million dollars on one hand and the casino's accepting the bet.  But putting aside such theatrical blunders, I took exception to the movie's given that all one needs to win at card counting is the ability to count and a corresponding ability to hide the fact that one is doing so.  Every text that I have ever read on probability suggests that any advantage that is confered by card counting is a minor one that can be felt only over a long run.  In this film, that long run was six hours.  For those who like me enjoy seeing films about their personal hobbies and do not mind seeing huge holes in logic and veracity, then HIT ME may suffice to kill ninety minutes without too much agida.",1176681600,,1530,4.321678321678322
