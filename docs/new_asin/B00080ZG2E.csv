2255870,5,B00080ZG2E,"How about that?  2 weeks after my copy of Season 2 (or the first contemporary season for literalists) arrives in my mailbox, I get to place my pre-order for the final season and at the same price to boot.  There are some who say that this season's villains are not as comic strip like, but it's a toughie to call.  Some of the things you notice in this final collection.  1) Charles Fox's music has been ""jazzed up"" a tad for during both the opening and closing credits, leaving Norman Gimbel's lyrics from both previous sets just a memory of the recent past.  2) Steve Trevor Jr's unexplained rank of ""Major"" (his father's rank from the war series) said to him first by Andros in the next to last segment of part 2 of ""Mind Stealers"" just as inexplicably becomes ""Colonel"".  As Diana says in, ""Flight To Oblivion"" ""Congratulations you finally got a promotion"".  3) Some of the clips from the Opening Credits are different than in the last set  (1 even includes the Rover).  The clips with Lyle Waggoner are the same just showed in reverse of the way they were shown in set 2.  They are completely removed in ""The Man Who Couldn't Die"" since he didn't appear in it (I still believe this was the finale despite the order these episodes will appear on disc), and replaced with clips from that episode (which were used in a previous episode as well). 4) The opening segments before the credits on some of these episodes are longer than on when they started using this format with ""Man Who Made Volcanoes"" in set 2 (the longest timewise I think is on ""Deadly Sting"" (which I still feel was the season premiere, listen to the music on the ending credits on this episode vis a vis any other in the collection and you'll hear why). 5)  For the first time in the contemporary series, an actor reprises a role (in the war series Carolyn Jones played the Queen and Debra Winger plays Drusilla in both ""Feminum Mystique"" and ""In Hollywood"" making the only reprisal of a character by the same actor in the war series).  Here Ed Begley Jr returns as Harold Farnum (the smitten college student in ""Diana's Disappearing Act"") in ""Fine Art of Crime"".  However, for  literalists, his famous father has gone from being a ""Congressman"" (referencing the House of Representatives) to a ""Senator"".  In this same episode you also see Rover is not as pesty as you think when you first meet him, when he locks Harold in a closet when he tries to secretly get to see Ira after Steve says no.  Rover also comes in useful in ""Formicida"", a bravura ""speaking job"" by the then popular husband/wife ""mime"" team of Robert Shields and Lorene Yarnell"".  Ok enough disecting this final DVD set of 1 of my favorites tv shows.  BUY IT AND COMPLETE YOUR COLLECTION (or if you haven't started already, order all 3 together). NOW!",1111190400,28,2790,4.546
2255871,5,B00080ZG2E,"This last season of Wonder Woman continued the Amazing Amazon's adventures in 1970's America. 22 episodes comprise the 1978-79 season.

Notable episodes include ""My Teenage Idol is missing"" where Wonder Woman helps to crack the kidnapping-switching of a teenage singing idol with an impostor, while ""Formicida"" has Wonder Woman go against another super powered woman who takes nature preservation to dangerous extremes through her insect control: bugs are being dispatched to stop the manufacture of a deadly pesticide because this person does not believe the pesticide is good for the Earth. This latter villian is different from some of the other people Wonder Woman has faced because good initial intentions only became warped through extremes.

Wonder Woman also faces a similar ethical issue in ""The man who could not die"" because she must save a newly-invincible man from being captured and exploited by dangerous groups. Having superpowers ultimately does not mean much if you are then vulnerable to exploitation from being a public (and 'everyday') citizen. Her secret identity as ""Diana Prince"" might be all that keeps Wonder Woman from facing similar peril.

""A date with doomsday"" eerily foreshadows the then-upcoming AIDS pandemic. Wonder Woman must prevent a virus from spreading around the globe. The all-critical plot catch being this deadly virus was first created in a laboratory and the HIV virus is rumored to have been created in similar conditions. I wonder if anybody in this series's scripting department knew anybody affected with what became HIV when this was written?

Unlike a lot of other shows past and present, the series production team knew when to end the show lest their product become stale. The diving suit was cool, but the wonder skate and bike suits were pushing sci-fi fantasy into 1960's camp absurdity. I mourned the series cancellation as a young girl, but now understand the wisdom of the television executive decision, Wonder Woman is now timeless for countless generations because somebody knew when to say `enough'.

There's some playing around with the theme song (adopting a disco influence) but the overall pop culture influence on this series is tolerable and certainly not as bad as it could have gotten (even the ""Disco Devil"" is a cut above other disco-themed series episodes in this era just because Carter is a good actress period). Of her second suits, I think the wetsuit kicks ass.

Special guest stars this season include Leif Garret, Roddy McDowell, Ted Shackelford and Joan Van Ark. Special features include star Carter's own commentary on the enduring power of Wonder Woman and her singing (in an episode). When some other celebrities are loathe to continue being associated with their signature role, Carter's ongoing warmth to the fans and continued enthusiasm for all things Wonder Woman is really admirable.

I am also thankful that the studios have thoughtfully kept the price of the DVD set down around 20 dollars. I can pass on the Shazzam series (one episode is included on a special bonus disc), but having all seasons of Wonder Woman is a mandate from Paradise  Island.

Considering how difficult it is to find Wonder Woman reruns on TV, the incomplete DVD release status of some other 70's series (Charlies Angels...etc) and the arm-leg cost of other TV seasons on DVD, this purchase is definitely worth it.",1111104000,56,3381,5.121597096188748
2255872,5,B00080ZG2E,"The third and final season of Wonder Woman is ready and waiting for sci-fi fans everywhere to enjoy. In this great colorful season, 22 episodes (two of which are 2-parters) spotlight the Amazing Amazon from Paradise Island. As with season two, season three continues Wonder Woman's (aka Diana Prince) adventures in Washington D.C. working as a secret agent alongside the dashing Steve Trevor (Lyle Waggoner). The episodes included in this set are:

My Teenage Idol Is Missing - Singer Leif Garrett guest stars as a teen singer who is kidnapped for extortion. His agent finds a double to stand in for the missing singer's concert while Wonder Woman tries to track him and his kidnappers down. BONUS: Lynda Carter commentary

Hot Wheels - When a Rolls Royce is stolen with a secret microfilm, Wonder Woman whirls into action.

The Deadly Sting - Professional football tampering causes the IADC to become involved.

The Fine Art Of Crime - Actor Roddy McDowell guest-stars as an art sculptor with a terrible knack of thievery. Will Wonder Woman be able to see through his deception?

Disco Devil - A disco owner is hypnotizing key officials. Diana Prince is soon on his trail.

Formicida - A strange woman environmentalist who controls ants terrorizes industrial companies who do not meet her eco-standards. Possessing ant-like abilities herself, she proves to be a match for even Wonder Woman!

Time Bomb - A fortune seeker from the future comes to the present to strike a name for herself. Wonder Woman and another future traveler try to stop her before catastrophy ensues. TRIVIA: This is the first time actors Ted Shackelford and Joan Van Ark work together, who are two of the best known actors in the later evening series Knots Landing.

Skateboard Whiz - Illegal gambling on the California coast causes Wonder Woman to don her very own Wonder Skate Suit and show off her skateboarding skills.

The Deadly Dolphin - When terrorists use helpless dolphins to attatch bombs to the bottom of boats, Wonder Woman spins into her diving suit to save them.

Stolen Faces - One of my favorite episodes! When Diana Prince learns that a Wonder Woman double was found unconcious, she ties her to a plot to steal wealthy Washington society patrons blind. TRIVIA: Contains one of the BEST Wonder Woman transformation scenes ever! Diana spins in mid-air when pushed off a building and lands as Wonder Woman. :)

Pot Of Gold - The luck of the Irish comes to life as Wonder Woman meets a real live leprechaun.

Gault's Brain - An evil telekinetic brain (you heard me right) proves to be a handful for Wonder Woman when it seeks a perfect body to reside in. TRIVIA: Appearance of the Wonder Wetsuit.

Going, Going, Gone - Submarine hijinks cause Wonder Woman to search for missing cargo.

Spaced Out - Diana Prince finds herself in the middle of a Sci-Fi Convention while investigating the disappearance of a special laser lens.

The Starships Are Coming - UFOs are spotted and Wonder Woman jumps into action. TRIVIA: Actor Tim O'Connor plays a government UFO expert, but earlier played an alien himself in the season one episode Judgement From Outer Space.

Amazon Hot Wax - Lynda Carter flexes her vocal talents in this episode as Diana Prince goes undercover at a recording agency. TRIVIA: Lynda uses her own voice, singing songs from her then recently released solo album Portrait. This episode was one of the few episodes not to be released on the Columbia House video collection due to a problem with music rights.

The Richest Man In The World - A top secret missile device is stolen. Enter Wonder Woman to save the day.

A Date With Doomsday - When a deadly virus is stolen Diana must get to the bottom of the case before a world-wide panic begins. TRIVIA: Appearance of the Wonder Bike suit.

The Girl With A Gift For Disaster - Is Diana's new aquatence just a clutz or is there something more to what is seen?

The Boy Who Knew Her Secret (Parts 1 & 2) - Aliens on the look for an evil inter-galactic shapeshifter track the escapee to Earth. Can Wonder Woman save the innocent humans who get in their way, or will she too become a victim of the alien battle?

Phantom Of The Roller Coaster (Parts 1 & 2) - A mysterious man living beneath an amusement part kidnaps a boy, but not all is as it seems. TRIVIA: The year this episode was made, the spotlighted rollercoaster shown debuted at the Warner Bros. owned Six Flags Magic Mountain theme park.

The Man Who Could Not Die - After a scientific experiment, a man discovers that he physically can not be harmed. Can Wonder Woman save him before he becomes a target for evil groups?

Along with these episodes a featurette focusing on Wonder Woman as a feminist icon will be given. More of the eternally beautiful Lynda Carter and crew's thoughts on the comic book heroine. You can't miss with this great, and final, Wonder Woman DVD set!",1111017600,124,4879,4.714117647058823

I still love the show but the music changes really ruin the episodes for me. However The Man Who Could Not Die was a wonderful format change too bad not more than one episode was filmed with Diana's Character finally ditches Steve Trevor out of her life and teams up with a fellow superinvinsible, God what a great idea and just one show in this new formant UGH> Could have been some really good adventures if the series renewed for year four. Also I was disappointed with the fact Dianas sister Drusilla disappeared for updated version. As well as some cool villians who would have been neat to see again in a sequel episode like, Mariposa, Count Calliostro,Tina the Wonder Girl, Havitol, oh but I forgot one stupid character played by Ed Begly Jr. as a nerd named Harold Farnum returns for one episode, they could have picked a better character from the previous year.

2256022,3,B00080ZG2E,"This dvd release is great except for one thing. I hate double sided dvd's. I've figure that 6 one-sided disks would hold every episode. That's why I gave it only three stars. About the show itself, I don't like the episodes take place in Los Angeles. I like the episodes that take place in Washington D.C. better. I also wish Steve was on more and in the field, as well. On Phantom of the Roller Coaster They said the park was called Fun Universe, but on the roller coaster on the screen in IADC headquarters it clearly says Magic Mountain. I already knew it was taped at Magic Mountain, but I feel they should have taken steps to make sure we didn't see the name of the real park. Like maybe replacing the name or covering it up on the coaster cars before taping it. I doubt the riders would have minded if Magic Mountain wasn't printed on the coaster car. In Time Bomb, Cassandra said in 20 years Adam's grandfather was going to work for the IADC. Now Adam was from 2155 and 20 years after he arrived in the past would be 1998. Adam's granfather would have had to be at least 20 or so then so he was born in around 1978. 2155 minus 1978 is 177 years old. The show didn't say his grandfather was still alive, but the way I can figure this up is if his father was about 70 more or less when he was born and his grandfather was 70 more or less when his father was born. Doesn't sound logical to me unless they started living a lot longer and slower in the future. It would make more sense for it to have been his great great grandfather. I cannot understand why they took out the words to the theme song. During the 2nd season the opening words to the song were no lontger there, but the words were on the end credits. The third season had no words except on the menu. I wish they had kept the words in during the opening and end credits.",1275523200,2,1837,4.162921348314606

2256027,5,B00080ZG2E,"While ""Wonder Woman - The Complete Third Season"", the final episodes of the popular series, offers many of the pleasures of the earlier seasons (particularly Lynda Carter's definitive portrayal of the Amazon Princess), it is far more contemporary than the earlier seasons, with a revved-up theme song, and episodes involving Disco, skateboarding, rock stars, even an episode highlighting Carter's terrific singing voice (she subsequently had a successful musical career). There is even an episode suggesting that had the series been picked up for a fourth season, Lyle Waggoner's 'Steve Trevor' character would have been dropped, as 'Diana Prince' was being reassigned to California (a wise move, as many of the earlier episodes, shot in California, but 'set' in Europe, or the Washington, D.C. area, had been a bit unconvincing!) Sadly, the show was cancelled (not because of ratings, as ""Wonder Woman"" had remained a solid, if not 'Top Twenty' series), but because CBS, with new 'Top Brass', wanted to revamp the network's weekly schedule with sitcoms, to compete with NBC.

This season, along with the previous ones, has become legendary, not only as a very successful interpretation of the DC Comics' heroine, but as a very positive statement of feminism and the empowerment of all women, as one of the most 'family-friendly' yet sexy series ever produced, and best of all, as a showcase for the extraordinary Lynda Carter and her remarkable skills. It remains quite 'fresh' and timely, after thirty years, and I very highly recommend buying all three seasons...Your kids will thank you, and you'll enjoy it, yourself!",1243382400,2,1622,5.2384615384615385
2256028,5,B00080ZG2E,This is such a campy fun series to watch! Lynda Carter as the ever so wonder woman! We get such a kick out of these old t.v. shows reliving the late 70's. can't wait to buy season 2!,1243296000,,182,3.8157894736842106

The features, though sparse, are the only thing worth buying with seasons 2 and 3. Otherwise, seasons 2 and 3 are ridiculous, terrible, and an absolute torture to sit through... no matter how appealing Lynda Carter was. Season 1, as a period piece set during WWII (the original Wonder Woman story) is timeless and still holds up today. Seasons 2 and 3 set in the 70's, the same time they were made, are incredibly dated, way too cheesy and instantly forgettable. Season 1 is all you need!!!",1236211200,6,587,4.547169811320755
2256030,3,B00080ZG2E,"This 1978-79 Season of WONDER WOMAN is my favorite season throughout it's whole 3-year run along with the fact that WONDER WOMAN's 3rd Season was more upgraded and more sophisticated than the first 2 seasons as well with a lot more action and WONDER WOMAN was a very popular TV show back in the late 1970's too, so I don't see how or why this show tanked in the Fall of 1979.

Another thing that baffles me about this season is why CBS decided to bring WONDER WOMAN back for 2 more episodes in August and September of 1979 as if WONDER WOMAN was going for a 4th Season and then abruptly cancelled out of the blue in the early Fall of 1979 after ""The Phantom Of The Rollercoaster"" episode, which was similar to when CBS abruptly cancelled THE INCREDIBLE HULK all of the sudden 2 years later in the mid Fall of 1981 while the Hulk was in the middle of it's Fifth Season and tanked on such short-notice after only 5 episodes during it's 1981-82 Season on CBS due to budget cuts & a change in management at CBS in the Autumn of 1981 after CBS had unofficially announced in July of 1981 that THE INCREDIBLE HULK was being cancelled which therefore made it similar to when CBS had suddenly cancelled WONDER WOMAN in mid September of 1979, because when CBS showed ""The Man Who Could Not Die"" episode of WONDER WOMAN on it's original air date for the first time on Tuesday August 28, 1979; I was under the impression that WONDER WOMAN was going for a Fourth Season and that ""The Man Who Could Not Die"" was the Season Premiere to WONDER WOMAN'S 4th Season, but it turned out that it wasn't, because this show had cancelled all of the sudden in the early Autumn of 1979 after showing us ""The Phantom Of The Rollercoaster Ride"" episode for the very first time on Tuesday September 11, 1979 which was the last time WONDER WOMAN was shown on CBS since the ratings apparently weren't high enough to kick off a 1979-80 Season, unlike THE INCREDIBLE HULK.

Therefore CBS had probably already had WONDER WOMAN's cancellation underway in the Summer of 1979 just like CBS already did for THE INCREDIBLE HULK in the Summer of 1981 when nobody even knew THE INCREDIBLE HULK was about to be axed, except THE INCREDIBLE HULK actually had an abbreviated season during its short-lived 5th Season run, despite the Hulks remaining strong ratings since creator(Ken Johnson)had to compromise with CBS by making the Hulks last season only half a season before THE INCREDIBLE HULK's cancellation in mid November of 1981, but THE INCREDIBLE HULK still outlasted WONDER WOMAN and still got better ratings than WONDER WOMAN did, despite the fact that Wonder Woman(Lynda Carter) had a lot more powers & quite a bit more advantages than the Hulk(Lou Ferrigno)ever did, despite the fact that the special-effects on THE INCREDIBLE HULK were the most expensive ones on TV at the time which were even more expensive than the special-effects used on WONDER WOMAN.

Something else about WONDER WOMAN's Third Season that baffles me is Wonder Woman explains to Skip(Clark Brandon)in ""The Boy Who Knew Her Secret"" episode that Diana Prince's next assignment will be permanently moved to L.A. where Diane Prince ends up moving to in the following episode ""The Man Who Could Not Die"" along with the fact that Diana's faithful fellow IADC agent Col. Steve Trevor(Lyle Wagner) was temporarily cut out of the cast and crew, but then Steve abruptly returns in the following episode ""The Phantom Of The Rollercoaster"" and Diana and the Inter Agency Defense Command are so-called back in Washington, DC as if she never relocated to Los Angeles or left D.C. in the first place and as if Steve Trevor never even departed from the show either, which was quite strange.

Something else I noticed about this 1978-1979 Season was Wonder Woman stopped using her invisible jet, despite the fact that it was really a Wonder Woman doll in the distant scenes, Trevor has spent a lot less time out in the field and more time in the office instead, plus Wonder Woman wasn't using her different voice impersonations like she used in the 1st Season either.

Overall; this season also takes me back to memory lane to the Fall of 1978 when I used to watch WONDER WOMAN at 8PM and then THE INCREDIBLE HULK at 9PM followed by DALLAS at 10PM; since all 3 of them were part of CBS's Friday night line-up at one time which gave me 2 more things to look forward to every Friday as well, but in the Winter of 1979 CBS had moved WONDER WOMAN to Saturdays back in February of 1979 and had briefly moved THE INCREDIBLE HULK to Wednesdays in January of 1979, but then CBS changed their minds and abruptly ended up moving THE INCREDIBLE HULK back to Friday nights back in March of 1979.

In addition to what made WONDER WOMAN's Third Season intriguing; I liked seeing interesting guest stars like
*The late British veteran actor(Roddy McDowell) in the ""Fine Art Of Crime"" episode

*Singer Leif Garrett in the ""My Teen Idol Is Missing"" episode during singer Leif Garrett's sex symbol days

*Famous DJ celebrity(Wolfman Jack) in the ""Disco Devil"" episode

*Football celebrity(Dick Butkus) in ""The Girl With The Gift For Disaster"" episode

*Singer Rick Springfield in the ""Amazon Hot Wax"" episode before his co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITAL and before his teen idol days when the song JESSE'S GIRL was a big hit on the radio

*Nicholas Coster in ""The Deadly Dolphin"" episode before his co-starring days on the soap opera SANTA BARBARA

*Eric Braeden in the ""Skateboard Whiz"" episode before his co-starring days as the high-strung Victor Newman on THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*Tim O'Connor in ""The Starships Are Coming"" episode before his co-starring days as Dr. Elias Huer on BUCK ROGERS

*Ted Schackelford and Joan Van-Ark in the ""Time Bomb"" episode before their co-starring days on KNOTTS LANDING and THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*Jared Martin in the ""Phantom Of The Rollercoaster"" episode before his co-starring days on DALLAS

*Charles Haid in ""The Girl For The Gift For Disaster"" episode before his co-starring days as Officer Andrew Renko on HILL STREET BLUES

*Del Monroe in ""The Richest Man In The World"" episode after his co-starring days on VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA

*Charles Brill in the ""Going, Going, Gone"" episode before his co-starring days as Capt. Lipschitz on SILK STALKING

*Ed Begley, Jr. in ""The Fine Art Of Crime"" episode before his co-starring days on ST. ELSEWHERE

*Peter Mark-Richman in the ""Gaults Brain"" episode before his co-starring days on SANTA BARBARA

*Craig Nelson in the ""Deadly Sting"" episode before his co-starring days as Hayden on COACH

*John Reilly in the ""Skateboard Whiz"" episode before his co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITAL

*James Sloyan in ""The Girl With The Gift For Disaster"" episode before his co-starring days on THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*Ken Tigar in the ""Stolen Faces"" episode before his co-starring days on DAYS OF OUR LIVES, DALLAS, & DYNASTY

Therefore, WONDER WOMANs 1978-79 Season had the best guest stars throughout it's 3-year run as well among other things.

As a matter of fact, something else I've noticed about WONDER WOMAN, especially in it's 3rd Season was a lot of guest stars who've been on WONDER WOMAN had also been on THE INCREDIBLE HULK too.

For instance Jared Martin, John Reilly, Rick Springfield, Del Monroe, Albert Popwell, Jennifer Darling, Peter-Mark Richman, Paul Tuerpe, Charles Brill, Henry Darrow, Dick O'Neill, Denny Miller, Christine Belford, Frank Doubleday, Taffee O'Connell, John O'Connell, Michael Baseleon, Nicholas Coster, Bradford Dillman, David White, Frank Marth, Brenda Benet, Art Metrano, George Caldwell, etc. all guest starred on THE INCREDIBLE HULK after having a guest starring role on WONDER WOMAN, which was quite interesting, despite the fact that THE INCREDIBLE HULK lasted longer than WONDER WOMAN did, due to the fact that THE INCREDIBLE HULK had better ratings.

I also used to think it was so neat how Wonder Woman would bend steel like clay, transform into swimsuit fashion, transform into motorbike fashion, etc., plus I had discovered later that the amusement park that they had used in real life for the ""Phantom Of The Rollercoaster"" episode was actually filmed at ""Six Flags Magic Mountain"" in Valencia, CA; since ""Magic Mountain"" is owned by Warner Bros., which is why they had to use ""Magic Mountain"" for an amusement park setting instead of ""Universal Studios"" in Hollywood, since WONDER WOMAN was a Warner Bros. incorporated  show like THE DUKES OF HAZZARD, MATT HOUSTON, FRIENDS, SUDDENLY SUSAN, etc.

This season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when CBS's motto was ""Turn Us On"", since that was the motto on CBS from September of 1978 thru August of 1979, plus it's so nice being able to watch these episodes complete & uncut without all those deleted scenes & added commercials you got when WONDER WOMAN was shown in reruns on ME-TV, The Sci-Fi Channel, and FX.",1216771200,5,8921,4.811764705882353
2256031,5,B00080ZG2E,Everything was perfect.  Product arrived promptly and was in perfect condition.  I am thrilled.  Thanks so much,1215907200,2,111,5.411764705882353
2256032,3,B00080ZG2E,"By the third season I was a little over it really. It wasn't quite as entertaining as the first two. But it held its ground. The show really came out before i was born and grew up watching the re-runs. It was nice female super hero that handled her business like she did without the always annoying egotisic mentality that often comes along. However I found her to still be a little stiff with her jumps althought very acurate but add a couple flips at least or at least fake it somewhat and throw in some punches at least. All the shoving got boring. A lot of the cut and paste jobs were to obvious for me (like in Knight Rider 80s))
 But hey, it was the 70's the creators had their way and still getting the point across. Those rediculous glasses oh come on after she takes them off and take her down you have to be a complete idiot to not know who she really was.

I really thought it was cute how close she was to steve trevor in both the 40 and again in the 70s but not once have been just a little  curious.

Anyway it was still a good show nonetheless.",1211328000,2,1059,4.101449275362318
2256033,5,B00080ZG2E,"This is really good viewing. Great episodes. Cool to see cars, locations and actors from back in the day. Lynda Carter is still the most beautiful woman on earth!",1196899200,,162,4.620689655172414
2256034,5,B00080ZG2E,This is at Target for $14.99....ALL 3 seasons are EACH $14.99...Don't think these guys are the cheapest!,1196380800,,104,5.176470588235294
2256035,5,B00080ZG2E,"I was a bit skeptical when I bought this (and season one) based on scant memory and reviews....I am pleasantly surprised at how GOOD this series was (so much so I'm going to buy season 2).

First off: the theme song, how can anyone NOT like the main theme? ""Wonder Woman, the whole world's waiting for you..."" putting ""satin tights"" in the lyrics was brilliant!
second: there was obvious dynamic chemeistry between Diana Prince (Lynda Carter) and Steve Trevor (Lyle Waggoner)...
The cheesy campiness of the 70's...love it!! the ""spin"" of Diana Prince to make her into Wonder Woman...the tight fitting outfits (each season coming out with a new one made me smile even more. I don't know which I loved more, the original outfit, the Swimsuit Wonder Woman outfit, or the one with her full cape and regalia).
I love one scene where she needs to chase criminals down on a motorcycle, Prince changes into Wonder Woman and actually has on a helmet, safety elbow pads (HAHAHAHAHA, since when did Wonder Woman need safety gear?.  the ""special effect"" noises of her ""leaps""....hehehehe.

In all seriousness the dialogue in season three is far crisper with lines like: Diana Prince talking to Steve and another male IADC agent ""Believe me, you are very female.""  Diana's quip: ""I was the last time I checked, at birth.""
classic humor!

The transformation of Wonder Woman's powers to this particular series was a smooth transaction and quite believable.  The acting by everyone, in partciular, Lynda Carter made Wonder Woman/Diana Prince far more respectable, realistic than Adam West's Batman.  They added a good bit of humor, campiness with the serious tone of the show to make it more than watchable.

Even the plots and plot devices were sometimes amazingly intelligent. Villains would use decoys, ""real"" traps or even try and KILL Diana Prince without all the usual stupidity involved.

23: the phantom menace part 1
24: the phantom menace part 2

** there seemed to be transitional plot issues in this episode, but I won't spoil it for viewers.**

The interviews with Lynda Carter is a nice touch, and she's a classic beauty whom no one can replace.  Lynda is right, I liked Wonder Woman now and then because she's not like the other ""superheroes"": she's not ridiculous with her powers, and she's human/mortal enough to be humble.

I hope the new Wonder Woman will get some slack, you cannot compare this one with the new version--though inevitable comparisons will arise.

thanks to this, I have a renewed interest in superheroes and pray that the new Wonder Woman will be half as good as this one is!

 Any fan of superheroes and heroines will definitely want to buy this set!",1194393600,2,3377,4.686971235194585

2256038,5,B00080ZG2E,"I adored Wonder Woman as an eight year old boy.  I loved her.  I was so thrilled to get these DVD's and share them with my best friends and their kids.  They are a little older than I was when I discovered the show but these ironic modern day kids got more than just the camp -- in fact, they totally understood why I loved Wonder Woman.  It's all about Lynda Carter.  The kid's pop said it best.  She keeps no ironic distance from her character, she embraces her in all her innocence, kindness, strength, native sense of justice and effortless love for her fellow creatures -- Gargantua included.  Being an actress can make affronts on your dignity and playing Wonder Woman in that comic book suit could have been embarassing.  But Lynda Carter brings such honesty and conviction to the character she rises above any criticism or ridicule.  Add larger than life beauty and a personality that genuinely glows and you have a prime example of classic movie (TV) magic.  Can we have her variety specials from CBS too?  I put a tape recorder to the TV speaker to record every song she sang, even those in her TV movies like ""The Last Song.""  I still know those songs by heart!  (""We're just like sister and brother but now we need each other/What's a little love between friends..."")  George Lucas says his movies are about friends who stick by each other and accomplish amazing things.  Luke used the force to blow up the Death Star but he couldn't have done so had Han Solo not returned to knock Darth Vader out from behind him.  Han's committment to Luke IS the force -- the transformative power of love, in and between individuals.  Somehow Lynda Carter gave us all that in an instant, just standing there with her outrageous feminine beauty, flashing that unbelievably beautiful smile.  As a kid she filled me with an estatic sense of love and of the possibilities of life.  Inspiration.  She still does.  It makes me so happy to see how many celebrate what she's given us.  Lynda, you are loved, and deserve every bit of it.  Thank you for bringing so much magic and inspiration into our lives.  (I'm not always this sappy.  Thinking of Lynda and Wonder Woman does that to me.)  How come no one mentions the little IADC mouse robot?",1181088000,3,2234,4.550251256281407
2256039,5,B00080ZG2E,"Looking as beautiful as ever Diana Prince / Wonder Woman sets out to save the world from spies, phantoms and mad scientists in the final season of the show. Season three's 4 disc set contains the remaining 24 episodes and shows us that ""Wonder Woman"" is once again up for the challenge. The picture and sound are as good as the previous seasons 1 & 2 and the show is just as entertaining, if not better!

Wonder Woman the Amazon Princess returns for her final season to protect the world from the forces of evil. Season three made an attempt to cash in on the roller coaster craze of the 70's with an episode called ""The Phantom of the Roller Coaster"". No 70's show would be complete without an episode containing disco music and Wolfman Jack provides the music in ""Disco Devil"". How will the final season end, will ""Wonder Woman"" fly off in her invisible plane for the last time?

The special features this time around include a commentary by Lynda Carter on episode #1 and a special feature documentary: ""Wonder Woman"" the ultimate feminist icon. If and when Hollywood decides to make ""Wonder Woman"" into a feature film, I hope they capture the spirit and beauty Lynda Carter brought to the character and due the film justice. Lynda Carter looked amazing as ""Wonder Woman"" and in that one piece outfit she was spectacular. Filled with lots of cheesy fun, season three was a fitting end to a beloved character and this great show.

2256040,5,B00080ZG2E,"Hard to believe this show was only on for three years, it's become such a pop culture fixture. Season three, though not quite as strong as season two, still entertains, and contains some very credible episodes. As usual, Lynda Carter fills the screen with every appearance, from her usual IADC headquarters to the move to Los Angeles. I was so sad when the series was cancelled, as a young (9 years old) fan, I couldn't understand why. Looking at it now, I can start to see the producers might have been running out of ideas for interesting episodes. Every series reflects the times and social influences of the times it was made in, and I must say some of the episodes in this season were actually rather silly. Wonder Woman on a skateboard? Wonder Woman on a motorcycle? I mean, really! Anyways, this series introduced Lynda Carter to the world as an actress, and I love that she still enjoys being associated with the role, instead of being so paranoid about her signature role, as so many actors get about theirs. This season, as were both seasons before it, is good escapist fun, and a good slice of television history.",1155600000,4,1124,4.625
2256041,4,B00080ZG2E,I am really pleased that I have purchased all three sets. Compared to the other two DVD this is as a good as the others. This would be a good series for whole familys to watch and talk about what Wonder Woman represented when it was on air. Doing what is rirht and every one has a place in society. This should be one of the DVD that parents with young children should have in their home.,1152057600,2,388,4.0519480519480515

2256044,1,B00080ZG2E,"I love Wonder Woman.  I gave the first season a four star rating.  But this third season?  I can't even finish watching all the discs.  There are two major problems with this.  The first is that virtually all of the comic book elements that make Wonder Woman interesting (which were embraced in season one) have been ditched.  The second is that this is just bad TV.  Plodding direction, weak and/or ham-fisted acting, dull scripting. A fine example on how not to make a live-action Wonder Woman.",1143417600,7,496,4.6976744186046515
2256045,3,B00080ZG2E,"For one more final season, we get to see the fabulous Lynda Carter bring the comic book character of Wonder Women to life in DVD.  Having already seen the previous two seasons, I was anxious to get my hands on this third and final series.

I've read some other reviews and each is of itself the opinion of its contributor.  While I found the Formicida episode to be a bit creepy, the teenage idol episode hosts a young Leif Garrett with whom his fans are sure not to miss.  Ms. Carter's commentary on this episode is quaintly informative.

All the stories showcase great scenes of the late seventies and my favorite parts of any show are when Wonder Women, already strutting her tight and well-fitted red, white, and blue costume, changes into the snug biker and wetsuits.  When we get to see her sporting her red cape - IT""S ON NOW!

There is an episode when someone catches Diana Prince ""turn"" into Wonder Women, but you'll have to watch that one to find out what happens.

In retrospect, this DVD lets the die-hard Wonder Women fans see the beautiful Lynda Carter let her hair down, literally (funny how no one could ever figure out that Diana was really a superhero).

Sadly, this DVD just stops with no real ending to what happens to Wonder Women in the future. However, the special features lets us into the ideas of Lynda Carter as she speaks of her opportunity to be an iconic female heroine.",1132099200,7,1400,4.523809523809524

2256047,5,B00080ZG2E,"This has to be the best of the three seasons Lynda Carter starred as Wonder Woman.  The wonderful disco-laden theme song, and the story lines are much better than the previous two seasons.  Season Two was pretty good, but season three was the final and best...a must have...",1128124800,2,274,4.6875
2256048,4,B00080ZG2E,"Well i have to agree this season isn't really the best. Although my favorite one is the one where she is the singer in Amazon Hot Wax. Love that one. Yes the show starts to twindle. They never seemed to really keep a steady storyline i suppose. But Linda Carter will always be great as Wonder Woman. I do notice a lot of the same special effects footage used over and over from other shows. But oh well what can you do? It was the 70's. Also in two episodes in this season, it doesnt show her change into Wonder Woman at all. She just suddenly appears as Wonder Woman. Its on disc one side two episode 4 & 6 feature no change into WW.",1127433600,2,634,4.08
2256049,3,B00080ZG2E,"As the title of my review suggests, this DVD compilation is not the best - it definetly could have been better.  Sure its wonderful to have the entire third season of episodes on DVD, but I wish Warner would have taken care in presenting the series EXACTLY as it appeared when released on television.  All - in all it is the same.  Again the closing credits have the current warner brothers logo instead of the original red labelled one.  Most importantly is the opening credits.  The sound is out of sync for several of the epidoes which is ridiculous as it was never that way.  The opening credits in season three were supposed to have 'The New Adventures of Wonder Woman' against a blue background (a few episodes on this DVD are correct), but most here are black which only appeared in the episode 'The Man who made volcanos'.  Luckily the stories themselves are unaffected otherwise this set would have been ruined.

I would have also liked to have the opening teasers for both 'The Boy who knew her secret part two' and 'the phantom of the roller coaster part two' which are missing on this box set.  What a pity.

I know the stories are presented as they were aired, but for story continuity they should have placed the 'phantom of the roller coaster before the 'boy who knew her secrets' concluding with 'the man who would not die' in which Diana Prince moves to los Angeles with a new life.  Lyle Waggonner is not in the credits any longer, assuming something has happened to Steve Trevor Jr.

The extra features are welcome, but I wish the directors would have given some incentive for Lynda to give new and intersting comments than content that already exists in seaon one and two box sets.  We never really get to know the production path of the series, nor evidence of changes about new sound effects, fads and influences to change content.  In addition Wonder Woman's new focus in life and comments of her evolution in attitude change becoming familiar with American culture.

overall it is not a bad compilation, but it certainly could have been presented better.  A shame the third season compilation had to end this way.  It feels incomplete.",1125360000,14,2159,4.639473684210526
2256050,4,B00080ZG2E,This is the best of series of Wonder Woman. My personal favorites is Formucida and Gault's Brain. Plus the Bonus features are much better also Lynda Carter commentary on Teenage Idol is great. If you missed out the rest. This is one to not miss out on.,1125360000,2,252,4.382978723404255
2256051,4,B00080ZG2E,"I have to admit I was worried about this one. I hadn't seen Wonder Woman in years, and I was sure it was going to be one of those shows that were great when you were a kid...but incredibly lame now. Wow - was I ever wrong! Sure, the stories are pure '70s storytelling with polyester bad guys and plot holes you can drive a mack truck through. But hey, every action adventure show from the Six Million Dollar Man to The Dukes of Hazzard to The A-Team was the exact same way! And besides, this isn't an Ibsen play - this is a comic book brought to life, and on that level it was surprisingly successful.

But what really amazed me was how perfectly cast Lynda Carter was as Wonder Woman. She just lights up the show every second she's on screen. She's thoughtful and charming and dynamic and incredibly gorgeous and kick ass...and just how you'd picture Wonder Woman if she'd stepped out of a comic book panel. Most of all, she's very natural as Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman, again amazing since this was one of her first acting roles, and criminal in the sense that Lynda was never able to parlay that same down to earth quality into any real substantial roles after Wonder Woman got the axe. And you don't have to go...okay, it's some half-naked model running around in Elton John's Halloween costume...you buy Lynda as the statuesque Amazon immediately. It's almost like she was born to play the role - she takes it all on so effortlessly.

In the hard facts department, the sound is crisp, the visuals are sharp and vivid (despite some very occasional grit) and Lyle Waggoner is still taking lessons from the Keanu Reeves School of Acting. (The man has the personality of lawn furniture!) The set features more than its share of unrelated comic art of the modern Wonder Woman too - but that's probably just DC Comics hoping to scrape up some interest in their current WW comics. But the most disappointing part of this set is the dearth of extras...all you get is a ten minute interview segment with Lynda and several WW artists and one rambling commentary track by Lynda (she sounds unprepared, like they'd just sprung the assignment on her). They could've thrown so much on here, whether it's an extended interview with Lynda or a career retrospective or a Wonder Woman picture gallery or an interview with the surprisingly AWOL Lyle Waggoner...c'mon, how busy could the guy be?

But when it comes right down to it, these shows are nothing short of entertaining. Even if you don't dig the wacky comic book storytelling, this set at least confirms one thing. If you weren't in love with Lynda Carter when you were a kid, either you didn't have a TV set or you're still working it out with your therapist. All you have to do now is throw in a disc, watch Lynda spin in place, her hair spilling free and... Oh. My. God.",1125273600,4,2821,4.527450980392157
2256052,4,B00080ZG2E,I was very satified with the product.  The picture quality was very good.  I did have a problem with a disc but Amazon.com sent me a replacement as soon as I reported it.  There could have been more extras but for the price I found it acceptable.  At least there was an interview with Lynda Carter.  It was a good tribute to the series.  Some of the most enjoyable episodes were in this season set.,1125273600,,398,4.24
2256053,5,B00080ZG2E,"This was my favorite show as a kid and I still like it!! Season 3 is a definate trip back to the 70s with episodes like Disco devil, skateboard whiz, and phantom of the rollercoaster, not to mention guest stars like Sheilds and Yarnell and Leif Garrett. She still has her magic laso, and a few new ones. Also episode commentary and interview makes this dvd set a addition to my collection!!!",1124928000,,391,4.444444444444445
2256054,4,B00080ZG2E,"Season Three is easily the best of the Wonder Woman franchise. Lyle Wagoner (as clueless Colonel Steve Trevor) and Linda Carter (as Wonder Woman and alter-ego Diana Prince) are fully comfortable in their roles by now. The producers let Wonder Woman smack bad-guy butt in a much more convincing way than before (she punches and kicks them now!) and spend money on fancy toys like helicopters now and then. Rick Springfield even shows up for another episode. Particularly strong is the writing, which frequently shows an appreciation for the comic book origins of the characters, and the innate goofiness of fighting evil while wearing a bustier.

 The plots and direction are much more solid in this second 1970s season of the show, following the first year where Wonder Woman had fought the Nazi's during World War II. Season Two mostly featured implausible terrorists of the Symbionese Liberation Army sort. This set features more interesting villains, including the Mob, art thieves, car thieves, Bondian criminal geniuses, right-wing nut-jobs, and various gun runners and international criminals.

 One amusing parlor game you can play while watching these episodes is seeing how many southern California canyons are implausibly described as ""suburban Washington DC."" A variation involves tracking how many lame excuses are found to send Diana Prince to California so they can film on the West Coast without having to use lame titles while showing Linda Carter driving around in California.

 For fans wondering why there was no season four, you can try to watch the only bad (awful actually) episode included here: ""The Man Who Could Not Die."" I really hope that the producer who decided to do this episode has been killed by Andros's death ray from season two by now, but anyway this episode includes the following: 1) moving Diana Prince to L.A., 2) adding a new super-hero to show and making him a cute male and making him a love interest [hello, the show is about Diana Prince here guys, don't you get this whole female super hero sexual dynamic thing? Check out Xena you idiots.] and making him indestructible, and therefore completely uninteresting, even if he did not have all the other problems, 3) adding a cute child side-kick, who would be modeled on Urkel, had that dreadful show already been made, 4) a chimp [I wish I was kidding, but I am not.] Can you announce ""jump the shark"" any louder? Wonder Woman rules, and Season Three is well worth the money. Just skip this episode (number 22) and be happy that there was no season four to spoil the fun.",1124409600,3,2567,4.916859122401847
2256055,5,B00080ZG2E,"Wonder Woman is back with one last season of adventures saving the world from the forces of evil.  These 24 episodes pick up where season 2 left off with Diana Prince as a field agent for the IADC.  She's confident, capable, and always gets her man.  Of course, it helps that she has a secret identity as Wonder Woman.

This season leaves behind Diana's origins on Paradise Island instead just dealing with the villain of the week.  It often enters science fiction territory with stories about aliens or living brains.  But there are also the episodes that deal strictly with international intrigue like ""Hot Wheels"" or ""Stolen Faces.""  And I must mention a personal favorite, ""Amazon Hot Wax.""  As a cross promotion for her recent record, Lynda Carter gets to sing two songs in this fun episode.

The show winds down with Diana moving to California and the IADC branch there.  While presented in their original broadcast order, I'm guessing that ""The Man Who Could Not Die"" was intended to air last since it introduces us to the characters I'm sure would have been regulars had the series continued.  ""Phantom of the Roller Coaster,"" meanwhile, finds Diana back in DC with no explanation of why she's there.  Of course, that episode is fun for me since ""Fun Universe"" is really an amusement part I've been to many times here in town.

Once again, we have a great set for fans.  The 24 episodes collected on four double-sided discs in full frame and stereo sound.  We are treated to a commentary from Lynda Carter on the first episode in the set, ""My Teenage Idol is Missing,"" which is worth a listen although it doesn't need your undivided attention.  Also included is a 13-minute documentary on Wonder Woman as a feminist icon, a topic I had never really even thought about before.

Yes, the fashions still seem laughable today.  And there definitely are some over the top episodes (""Formicida"" springs to mind), but these are kept to a minimum this time around.  Ultimately, fans of the show will enjoy watching these episodes again and those without fond memories will probably best look elsewhere.",1123372800,4,2102,4.772853185595568
2256056,5,B00080ZG2E,"Nominated for a single Emmy in its short three season stint, Wonder Woman - which premiered in 1976 - was the third attempt by the major networks to bring the popular comic book character to TV. Created as the result of a collaboration between the multi-talented William M. Marston and DC Comics publisher Maxwell Gaines, Wonder Woman made her world premiere in a 1941 comic book. The final product of Gaines' request for a female comic book hero, Marston never lived to see his creation become a television star (he died prematurely from skin cancer in 1947), but his legacy lives on through the Wonder Woman franchise which continues to entertain worldwide audiences to this day...

Wonder Woman follows the exploits of the Amazonian princess, Diana, who leaves her Paradise Island home in order to bring justice to the world of men. Athletic and intelligent, Diana Prince (as she's known to the outside world) also possesses special powers that are brought about when she whirls around to transform into Wonder Woman. Her magic belt gives her added strength, her metallic bracelets deflect bullets, and her tiara doubles as a boomerang... In addition, she's aided by a magic golden lasso which forces her captives to tell the truth! Season 1 of Wonder Woman takes place during the era of World War II where the Allies enlist the help of the female superhero to defeat the Nazis, while Seasons 2 and 3 take place in modern day times (1977-1978)...

The Wonder Woman (Season 3) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""My Teenage Idol is Missing"" in which a popular teenage pop singer is kidnapped and replaced by a clone, and only Wonder Woman can save the day for the singer and his legion of dedicated fans... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""The Deadly Dolphin"" in which Wonder Woman must face down a deadly dolphin, and ""A Date With Doomsday"" in which Wonder Woman is once again tasked with saving the world from imminent destruction...

2256059,5,B00080ZG2E,"I can't believe it took Warner Bros. this long to release this gem of a series but like they say ""good things come who those who wait"".  Besides, it gives us chance to see how cheesy we really were back in the 70's.

I agree with what Lynda says in the commentary during the ""My teenage idol is missing"" episode.  I would have liked for the series to end with a purpose.  Just like it starts with a reason for Wonder Woman to return to America, it should have ended with a reason for her to leave for Paradise Island.  It needed more closure, however, that does not take away from the awesome abilities of Lynda Carter to embody the character she so marvelously portrayed.  She IS and ALWAYS will be WONDER WOMAN.",1121472000,4,713,4.323308270676692
2256060,5,B00080ZG2E,"It was difficult for me to get this season because of money and dollar being expensive here.

This season is not the best but i have always loved Lynda Carter. She did a great job as Wonder Woman. I'm a grown up doctor but there is a child inside of me. I'll introduce my kids some day to the beautiful Lynda Carter.

I Argentina the ratings were on the top because of this show back in the 70's.

We love and loved you !!!!

In an exclusive interview for Argentina she spoke to her fans in a very touching way...she said she would want to visit us some day. We are all waiting for you !",1120953600,5,587,4.0344827586206895

2256063,5,B00080ZG2E,"I remember when 'Wonder Woman' was on the air in the late 1970s and early 1980s as a young child. She was sexier and more entertaining than 'the Bionic Woman' (and just about every other woman on tv except maybe Suzanne Somer's character of ""Chrissie"" on 'Three's Company'), and had a real comic book character drama scripting episode by episode. What sets 'Wonder Woman' apart from 'Superman' & 'Batman' back-in-the-day is that you really got to feel her character as person first. And then as a super heroe. She was as personable as can be; yet, she knew just when to put you in check with her super powers. She was very selective and timing in using them.

Even as the times have adjusted now with the new exploration into who is 'Batman' movie of the Summer with darker themes, 'Wonder Woman' stands so far in front and unlike 'Catwoman' (movie) it actually was worthy of awards such as Emmys [being it was a tv drama]. I think it was nominated for an Emmy.

Finally, you will her 'Invisible Helicopter' and other supernatural surprises for fighting crime.",1120435200,,1060,4.663101604278075

[...]",1119830400,6,151,4.96
2256065,3,B00080ZG2E,"Season 3 represents the final and most lackluster season of the 'Wonder Woman' TV series.  There were a lot of very notable changes both on-screen and off.  Behind the scenes, much of the original crew from co-creator Stanley Ralph Ross to costume designer Donald Lee Feld had moved onto other projects as the series was retooled to make it more network friendly.  Some of these changes included the dismissal of references to Paradise Island, the decrease in Lyle Waggonner's likable part, and probably the hardest pill to swallow...the elimination of Diana Prince's eye glasses.  While some might argue that using glasses as a disguise was preposterous anyway, one cannot overlook Lynda Carter's fine performance differentiating between the more outwardly Wonder Woman and the introverted Diana Prince, which made the conceit more plausible (Think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christopher-Reeve/dp/B000VS6LYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christopher Reeve</a>&nbsp;and his marvelous interpretation of Clark Kent).  However, with the glasses gone, there is absolutely no contrast between Lynda Carter's handling of the dual roles.  As the season progresses and Diana Prince is made more glamorous (even having her hair long and wavy like Wonder Woman's), any and all semblance of reality is gone as one can't help but wonder why no one can tell that Diana Prince is Wonder Woman.

From a standpoint of storylines, this season offers Wonder Woman situations that seem somehow beneath her scope.  Art thieves, football gamblers, and mischievous Leprechauns are not the kind of problems that one would expect a powerful princess who came to ""man's world"" on a mission of peace to undertake.  However, there are some rare gems in the otherwise banal plot devices, such as the dark two-part ""The Boy Who Knew Her Secret"" and my personal favorite, ""Disco Devil.""

The extras on this set are very slim, which is not surprising as WB doesn't seem very interested in giving fans much in the way of extras with their classic TV show DVD releases.  There is a commentary by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lynda-Carter/dp/B000E372BS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lynda Carter</a>&nbsp;on the first episode, although this seems like a poor choice as it is far from the best episode this season had to offer.  Finally, there is a very brief featurette regarding Wonder Woman being a great Feminist icon as seen by prominent females.  As if this rather obvious notion wasn't already addressed thoroughly in the previous DVD release documentaries, it is drilled into our heads ad nauseum here.  A more welcome inclusion would have been retrospectives on key episodes from the remaining crew members, or some vintage promos and commercials...or both!

Despite the negatives, this set would still make a suitable addition to anyone's DVD library.  Lynda Carter shines as always as Wonder Woman even when the scripts required the audience to leave their brains at the door.  There is no telling what the future holds for Wonder Woman's return to the screen, but it is certain that Lynda Carter will always represent Wonder Woman admirably to much of the world.",1119312000,7,3227,5.566462167689162
2256066,5,B00080ZG2E,"The only bad comment that I can make about this release is that it is the final season for Wonder Woman.  First of all, it is such a thrill to finally have the complete series available.  The previous Columbia House release omitted 5 episodes, and 3 of them were from Season 3.  On this release, Lynda encounters time travelers, would-be Martians, a true super villainess, a leprechaun, an amusement park monster, and a boy who discovers her secret identity, just to name a few of the highlights.  Oh yeah, and Lynda sings 2 songs in ""Amazon Hot Wax"".  That along makes the DVD a must have.  However, most fans won't be disappointed with this set.  The episodes look fantastic, and we are also treated to 2 bonuses.  A third documentary which features interviews with Lynda and several authors of WW books.  Lynda also provides commentary on the first episode, ""My Teenage Idol Is Missing"".  Although some of the commentary is more general to the series, it is still great to hear Lynda think back on her classic role.  It is really great to hear her speculate about what is about to happen.  Apparently she hasn't watched these episodes as many times as we have!  All in all this a terrific set, and you must have it to complete the collection.  A true gem!!",1118966400,6,1259,4.5874439461883405
2256067,1,B00080ZG2E,"There is a reason why the show was cancelled on CBS after Season 3. It was bad. Season 2 was alot more fun and entertaining involving Wonder Woman & Steve Trevor. Wonder Woman & Steve appear in maybe one scene together in about 4 episodes the entire Season 3. The only bearable episode is ""Skateboard Wiz"" with some great action. ""The Boy Who Knew Her Secret"" is not all that good like most Fans say. Steve Trevor should have found out her secret...not some boy. The show went too Sci-Fi. A preview of what could have been a bad Season 4 was ""The Man Who Could Not Die"" where Diana Prince moves to Los Angeles, with new cast members and no more Lyle Waggoner. This SEASON 3 DVD Set features 24 episodes of Diana Prince on dull adventures. Lynda Carter is excellent as Wonder Woman in this season as always, just as Christopher Reeve was excellent in the bad sequals Superman III & IV. If anybody loves WONDER WOMAN and wants to remember her at her best, enjoy the The Complete Second Season DVD Set.",1118880000,6,999,4.405405405405405
2256068,4,B00080ZG2E,i think my dvd player does not like this season. as soon as i put it in. it sounds like its destroying the disc.  i can here it spin. like it cant read it. but does. scratching the other side of the disc. i got to watch some episodes. not the best year. as season 1 and half of season 2. the first 9 episodes. after that. it went downhill. but it is good to have all 3 seasons.,1118534400,2,377,3.7721518987341773
2256069,1,B00080ZG2E,"I was a big fan of season one and the first half of season two, but season three is awful! All the charm and fun that was present in those seasons are missing on this set. Why was this season so bad? Many reasons- there is no supporting cast; it's just Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman and Diana Prince, while Lyle Waggoner, as Steve Trevor, is reduced to only having phone conversations with Lynda Carter, reportedly because she refused to be in scenes with him. Plus, we get more of the goofy robots and computers that help Wonder Woman catch the bad guys, probably because they appealed to young children that were watching. There is no mention of Paradise Island, the Amazons, or her mission of peace, and there's absolutely no character advancement. Episodes where secret government agent Diana Prince goes undercover at a recording studio or at a science fiction convention are just painful to watch. The effects are poor, the writing bad, and the constant use of stock footage is repetitive and boring (we see Wonder Woman jumping over the same fountain about a half dozen times). If you are a die-hard fan of Wonder Woman and don't care about plot or good writing, and only enjoy watching Lynda Carter twirl around, than this is the dvd set for you. Otherwise, stick to the first two seasons!",1118448000,17,1296,4.663755458515284

""Amazon on Hot Wax"" Has to be my favorite Episode since Lynda Carter has such an amazing siging voice.  Just to note that you might wanna check.  When I purchased my copy the first disk was defective.  Side A was Episodes 1-3 and Side B was also episodes 1-3.
