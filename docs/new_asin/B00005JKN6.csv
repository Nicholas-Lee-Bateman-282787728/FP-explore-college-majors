1438216,4,B00005JKN6,"Finally!  Now a truely international action hero of our era, Jackie Chan came back to Hong Kong movie.  This is what he wants to do, and avid fans should not miss it!
Of course, the plot is only an excuse for involving him into a series of actions.  But it is his action scenes that count.  And ""Accidental Spy"" gives them to you.
This time we have two standout scenes, both of which take place in Turkey: one of them shows how Jackie escapes from thugs in spice market, stark naked (Yes, naked!!!), using various props you can think of in a lightening speed.  Silly?  Sure, but absolutely funny and hilarious, and I even respect him for doing that in a hot country, his body all over spices (think about how he felt)!  The other comes at the end, in a ""Speed""-like way, with a tank truck set on fire running on a bridge, and fans, you know what he is going to do?  Of course, he jumps from there!
As in Jackie's movies made in Hong Kong, the script is weak and sometimes you have to sit through occasional slack.  To be fair, the script of Ivy Ho, who is responsible for that of much inferior ""Gorgeous,"" is better than you might expect, and I have no complaint about it.  And true Jackie Chan fans should know that death-defying action is not a thing you can do every day.  Naturally you want more, and more, and more (yeah, I understand), but think about it; 5 minutes of HIS action is always worth your money.
And lastly, as one of many Jackie fans in Japan, I believe this is his movie should be.  I am ready to go to see another ""Rush Hour"" but it is a Hollywood-made, not-exactly-his-style work.  Remember, ""Accidental Spy"" is clearly made with mainly Asian audience in mind (cast of Vivian Hsu, popular in Japan and Taiwan, and Min-jeong Kim, who comes from Korea, testifies to that) but this fact should not discourage any movie fans from seeing it.  Just sit back, relax; get laughs, get thrills, and enjoy it. Just like we do.",1007251200,13,1937,4.374301675977653
1438297,4,B00005JKN6,"The film is about Jackie Chan's character who is trying to find his father.  He is told that his father is a man from Korea who is dying and appears to be a bad guy.  Typical of Jackie Chan movies is the beautiful cop and an adventure that takes you from Hong Kong to Korea to Turkey.  Also, you get an introduction to one of the most popular Asian actresses in the East, Vivian Tsu (Taiwan and Japanese pop singer/actress).

This movie is way better than ""Who Am I?"" and the acting is much better as well.

As for the movie, the audio is fantastic via DTS and the video is beautiful as well but unfortunately not anamorphic.  As for special features, there is a pretty cool making of featurette but unfortunately it is not subtitled in English.

Otherwise a solid movie for Jackie Chan and much better than ""Rumble in the Bronx"", ""Who Am I?"" and other movies of his that may be distributed internationally.",1220400000,,907,4.427710843373494
1438298,3,B00005JKN6,"It's a fair action comedy startting Jackie Chan. It has some funny momnents. All the action scenes look exactly like they were copied and pasted from other excellent movies of Jackie such as Supercop, etc.

Because of that reason, I gave it 3 stars. I've watched it once but I did not buy it.",1204848000,,292,4.407407407407407
1438299,3,B00005JKN6,"While Accidental Spy did a decent job of keeping me engaged, I think it was mostly the fact that the movie is slightly under an hour and half.  The plot was not too bad, but what lacked throughout the movie was a really good stunt or two by Chan, and no good fight scenes that match up to his quality in other films.  Don't get me wrong, there are some beautiful scenes and it will entertain, but I expected even more.  This is one of Chan's later movies, and his age might be catching up, but all in all I hoped for bigger and better.

Like I said, the movie was engaging for the most part, and overall everything is decent, but thats all it is - no high excitement from maybe but a very few scenes.  The best was in the middle of the movie, a good foot chase scene, where Chan is being chased by a gang of men through public streets, and Chan manages to loose his bathtowel, thus fighting off goons while finding random objects to keep himself ""covered up"".  Its good, funny action.  The finale of the movie is really nothing more than Chan saving a couple from their gas tanker that is on fire, nothing to do with the bad guys, they are done for before this scene.  Its pretty cool scene but limits Chan's stunts and action abilites, except for his jump from the tanker in the end which is pretty cool.

The dubbing, fortunately, isn't too bad and Jackie Chan dubs his own voice which I think works so much better.  Most of the charcaters in the film are pretty bland, no one is memorable.  Most of the film takes place in Istanbul, so if you have seen very little of Turkey you get to see quite a bit of its capital in the film.

Accidental Spy is an ok movie, something to have only to complete your Chan collection and if you desire something you haven't seen before.  I would find this difficult to want to watch over and over unlike other films such as Legend of Drunken Master or Who Am I.",1165449600,2,1898,4.209944751381215
1438300,3,B00005JKN6,"I like this film fine, and I can't truly find any fault with it.  It's just seems to fall well short of Chan's usual work.  That's kind of unfair, considering that most his other films are terrific, and this one is only good.  But in the end, I have a hard time recommending it.

The action sequences are well executed, but lacking Chan's usual flair.  The end bit about a tanker truck on fire and Chan having to rescue the driver and his family is just silly.  How long can that truck stay on fire without exploding?  I never care for the big stunt endings.  I'd rather have enjoyed a creative martial arts showdown.

Not terrible, but not great either.  Better than ""The Prisoner"" and ""My Lucky Stars"", two of Chan's very rare bad films.  But still falls just a bit short.",1121212800,,774,4.380281690140845
1438301,4,B00005JKN6,"Jackie Chan is back again in this fast paced action comedy. The action starts in Hong Kong, where Jackie works as a sales assistant selling exercise equipment. The viewer is immediately thrown into an action packed chase scene where Jackie pursues robbers in a shopping mall. Jackie Chan always makes good use of the props surrounding him, which is always a delight to witness. The action is then tranferred to Korea where he meets his missing Korean father, who worked as a double agent for the Koreans and the Turkish drug lords. Jackie is now involved in the unwrapping of the mystery which surrounded his father. The decoding of a telephone number leads him to a bank in Turkey. Here he is pursued by both Turkish and Korean drug barons who are looking for the Opiate Maxe, a highly addictive drug.
Although the plot is nothing to shout about, the action scenes more than make up for it. The best chasing/fighting scene had me in fits of giggles, when Jackie is chased through a Turkish market naked with nothing but props he picks up on the way to cover his modesty! This is classic Jackie Chan, where the fight scenes are brilliantly orchestrated and with dashing of humour thrown in. One thing I can't figure out is who are the girls on the cover of the DVD. They certainly weren't featured in the film as the two main girls who do paly in the film are orientals.

1438302,4,B00005JKN6,"I WROTE THIS BEFORE BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO IT. JACKIE CHAN IS VERY FUNNY IN THIS MOVIE. I'VE NEVER LAUGHED SO HARD AT THAT SPECIAL SCENE IN THE MOVIE(YOU'LL SEE WHAT I MEAN). SEE THIS MOVIE AND FORM YOUR OWN OPINION. SOME MIGHT FIND IT SILLY.
NO MATTER, I ENJOYED IT. I HOPE YOU ENJOY IT TOO...",1054252800,2,305,4.1
1438303,4,B00005JKN6,"First of all, I'd like to say that I love this movie.  I had begun to lose faith in Jackie Chan after seeing some of his latest films like The Tuxedo and Shanghai Knights, but this film reminded me why I love him.  The stunts are wonderful and very nicely choreographed.  The camera work is tight and very nice.  The writing is well above par for a Jackie Chan film.
The only thing about this film that bothers me is the DVD itself.  Whoever made the cover for this DVD was on crack.  You see the three other people on the cover besides Jackie Chan?  Well, they're not in the film at all.  I was waiting to see the silly blonde or the angry guy with the gun show up, but they weren't there.  Not at all.  Also, the copy on the back is full of flaws.  There's several major differences between the copy and what actually happens in the film.  Aside from the cover being horribly incorrect, there's no original language track option.  That made me very sad.  Also, there are absolutely no extras on this DVD.  Unless you count a badly dubbed French language track as an extra.  I know that I don't.
In conclusion, awesome film, terrible packaging and DVD.  But the actual film is amazing.  Pure Jackie Chan.",1051401600,3,1205,4.351351351351352
1438304,5,B00005JKN6,"This is definitely a classic. His American-made movies lack the charm and choreography of his HK ones. This is an HK one and SHINES moreso than his other treasures.
And his ""nude run through the bazaar"" is hilarious as well!",1048118400,,224,4.625
1438305,2,B00005JKN6,"Jackie Chan plays a salesman who specialises in gym equipment. His life is turned upside down when he discovers his father was a Korean double agent who had made a deal with drug dealers to make super addictive opium. Chan is assigned the task of tracking down his father, who has since defected.
ACCIDENTAL SPY is mainly lacking the slapstick humor and elaborate stuntwork that are Chan's hallmarks. The movies climactic stunt featuring a flaming oil tanker mildly rips off SPEED and LICENSE TO KILL. You'd expect more originality from Chan. The movies' final ""twist"" will only surprise those who haven't been paying attention, or possess the I.Q of a NZ Green Party member. This isn't one of Chan's best, but the out takes at the end are always fun to watch and ACCIDENTAL SPY is no exception. This went direct to video in NZ. It's not hard to see why. Unfortunately this ranks alongside WHO AM I and THE PROTECTOR in the lower ranks of Jackie's portfolio.",1048032000,,958,4.708333333333333
1438306,1,B00005JKN6,"This movie was soo boring. I now know that comments about the film on the cover are all lies. In Sweden it said; ""Its so action packed it makes ""Rush Hour"" go in slowmotion"". This was only for Chan to prove that he can make a movie creep slower than a frozen snail. He rarely fights, and when he does, he doesnt do any cool moves and he lacks speed. He doesnt do any dangerous stunts anymore and he is even using special effects to do some athletic scenes in his other movie ""The Tuxedo"". He himself said ""I don't use special effect, I am the special effect"" what about now? Hope he gets better with ""Shanghai Knights"".
This ... wasn't even worth to rent. He doesnt even give many laughs these days.",1047513600,,699,4.2631578947368425
1438336,3,B00005JKN6,"I found this to be a very engrossing Chan film - despite the typically [weak] plot and the evident butchering by Miramax, still the heart of the film shines through, and we have a suprisingly emotional film. And what's this? An actual tear elicited in the film's final third? You'll see what I mean - and one of the most beautiful of the Chan films as well, referring to the Cinematography. All this plus the top notch fight scenes make this a definite must-have for the Chan collector (if you can live with the idea that this is in no way the ORIGINAL film).

But what I REALLY want to mention is the Cover to the DVD. I have to admit I am some kind of a [fool] to have fallen for it. Go on, take a look at it real quick and let's dissect this. We have: 1) Jet Fighters - but the film has no jet fighters in it! 2) A paratrooper - but the film has no paratrooper! Wait, it gets better - we have 3) A hot brunette and an even hotter blonde with a very sexy ""shhh, don't tell anyone how sexy I am"" pose going on - yes boys, I really looked forward to getting home with this one because of the blonde - but guess what! NO BLONDE! Neither hot chick is in the film!

But best of all, my all around favorite. We have 4) A black man in shades holding up a gun with a big grin on his face. No, he's not in the film either. But, what I love is how obvious the distributors are being here. What black actor do you suppose they hope the stupid masses will think this man is? What black actor who was recently in two hit blockbuster films with Jackie by the name of Rush Hour? Could it be . . . CHRIS TUCKER! Of course, it's not even him on the cover, much less in the film.

Anyway, don't let the bogus cover throw you, it's still a good flick! Not as good as Who Am I? But worth a buy . . .",1041552000,,1781,3.914364640883978
1438337,2,B00005JKN6,"I'm sure most of us who have ever come across, and perhaps even have grown to like, some classic Hong Kong movie (such as Police Story, Drunken Master II), would have heard the not-so-secret about how Miramax/Dimension films bought most of the Hong Kong movies distribution right. It seems like they bought more than just the right the distribute, they have bought the films and, despite the Directors/Filmmakers original intention, they cut it as they see fit.
The problem is, they don't see very well. Without a good understanding of other's cultural background, they simply categorize what they do not understand as redundant. The result are some horrific, hollow effort that will lead the American viewers believe that Hong Kong or other countries are unable to produce quality motion pictures. While Miramax/Dimension are considered to be ""Independant Studios"" who respect the artisic view of the filmmakers, they are nothing more than bunch of short-sighted, self-righteous hypocrites.
Though they do make an effort to digitally restore/remaster the original film to provide a sharper, clearer image, they more than often largely mutilate the film: creating new, trailor-like (useless and sometime even become spoiler) credit sequence, replacing original music score with cheesy/ridiculous techno, awful dubbing and worst of all, cutting out numerous sequences of the movie. Slap on a laughable cover and it is ready to be re-sold as a Miramax/Dimension production.
To make this long aggravation short, The Miramax/Dimension version of ""Accidental Spy"" is a perfect example. The cover of the DVD has got nothing whatsoever to do with the film except it features Jackie Chan (Who the hell are the two women holding pistols?). Secondly, 20+ minutes of the film was trimmed (That is the equal length of an episode of ""Friends""!), thirdly, a cool(?) titile sequence is inserted basically give away all the stunt and action scenes at the beginning of the film, and finally, though most of the dialogue in this movie are originally English, for the part when the characters are speaking Mandarin/Cantonese, they somehow got Jackie himself to do his own English dubbing, only they are bad, and does not provide the story as it should be (Note: Jackie's Character ""Bei"" actually has a certain ""psychic"" power). I mean, they even dubbed the ""outtake"" sequence, wouldn't you think it's absurd?
I eventually obtained an original version, and enjoyed it much more as I have a better understanding of the characters, or you could say I was into the story more simply because I was not distracted by the dubbing.
The original version even include some ""making-of"" documentary, cast & crew bio, trailors, and oh! DTS soundtrack (though somehow the DTS track on this disc proved to be a disappointment).
If you somehow got the Miramax/Dimension version, I am sorry but you are not watching this movie as it really should be. I give 2 stars for this version. For the original version, I believe it actually deserve a 4 star rating.",1039564800,31,3020,5.115384615384615
1438338,4,B00005JKN6,"With the few stunts sequences in Rush Hour and Shanghai Noon, many people were starting to wonder if Jackie Chan was getting too old to do them anymore. Accidental Spy proves them all wrong.
In this film he crashes through a building on a crane, fights in a turkish market naked (using whatever is availible to fight AND keep his dignity) and has an action paced car chase with a flaming fuel truck. If you like jackie chan, you'll love this film.
His stories are getting better too; while his older works were usually spoofs and obvious comedy's, his later have had less ""double takes"" and more emotion. Jackie really is a great ACTOR ontop of his martial arts skills (see ""gorgeous"")
if you want a mindless action packed Jackie Chan film, try this one out, though you may find it's not as ""mindless"" as you might think!",1037664000,,821,4.554054054054054
1438339,5,B00005JKN6,I am Jackie's biggest fan and i've watched and enjoyed all of them! This film is not what fans might expect. It is uite serious and quite word but the stunts and fighting scenes are terrific!!!!!! Highlight: when Jackie runs around butt-naked in Turkey!,1037059200,,253,4.7727272727272725
1438340,1,B00005JKN6,"The Accidental Spy is one of Jackies better recent movies.  There's no disguising the fact he's getting older, and can't quite manage the jaw-dropping feats of his youth, but in this movie he still shows that he has more understanding of action scenes than almost anybody else on the planet.  The Accidental Spy also has a reasonably good script.
However, what you will see with this DVD is not really the movie The Accidental Spy at all.  The distributing company have, for reasons best known to themselves, decided to cut about half an hour out of the movie for it's US release.  They have also decided for us that we should watch the movie in English, despite it having been recorded in Jackie's native Cantonese.  Dubbing ruins movies, pure and simple.
Hence, whilst I believe that people should see The Accidental Spy if they are a fan of Jackie Chan or action cinema in general, I cannot recommend that anybody purchase this DVD version.
Track down the Hong Kong DVD instead, which might not have Miramax level mastering, but at least presents the movie as it was meant to be seen.  The butchery Miramax have applied to the movie is an offence to the movie makers and the US audiences in equal measures.  Don't support releases like this, and maybe one day the US studios will learn to treat their audience with respect.",1031356800,12,1326,4.665236051502146
1438341,4,B00005JKN6,"When a borrowed this off a mate, i was wondering why it had never been released in the cineama's in the UK. I wondered if the film was weak but when i watched it i was proved wrong.
Jackie gives a strong performance in this Hong Kong spy thriller. He is a gym equipment saleman when a dectective tells him he is the son of a Korean spy. His father is on his deathbed when Jackie sees him but it turns out his father was a double agent and some turkish drug lords are after him. The plot is silly but it gives jackie a chance to do some spectacular stunts.
Right from the beginning when he crashes through a building wall on a crane to the end when he is on a burning lorry, the pace of the movie never slows. You would never guess that jackie is almost 50 with the stunts that he performs in here. My favourite scene was when Jackie was fighting the Turks in the market (semi naked) used every item possible to defend himself. It is classic Jakie Chan action from the word go.
It is a succesful return to Hong Kong theature for Jackie after some Hollywood films (Rush Hour, Shanghai Noon) but he once again proves he has got what it takes. It may lack a good plot and some of the intense fighting of Chan's older Hong Kong flicks but The Accidental Spy is defeniatly one to see.",1029888000,2,1278,4.157258064516129
1438342,4,B00005JKN6,"I am a huge Jackie Chan fan and have been for several years now. When I first heard about this movie I was a little leary about it due to some of the reviews I had read and the fact that it didn't earn a theatrical release here in the states. But I must say that I was very pleasently surprised when I popped into my dvd player yesterday afternoon.
With this film, Jackie proves once again, that he is the man of action films. No one does it better. Period. The stunts in this film are amazing as usual and Jackie still looks in top form even though he's pushing 50. The fight scenes are creative and use Jackie's usual style of incorporating many different objects and people into the scenes. The best scene in the movie is a 10 minute fight fest that lands Jackie naked on the streets of Turkey. Very creative!
The plot of the movie is pretty decent for a JC film. Basically, Jackie gets mixed up in a drug war between the Koreans and the Turkish. I watched the english dubbed version so I'm sure the plot lost a little bit in the translation. But the plot is not the main reason we watch these type of films right? The action is great and definately worth the price of the dvd alone.

Wonderful unusual but exciting music, very Turkish in tone, with the closing song by HK singer Jacky Cheung.  I highly recommend the HK version.  But this one ... I think the US have done it again.  It is 86 minutes, the HK version is about 108, so they have chopped it!  The music?  I don't dare imagine!  Why is opium involved?  The whole object of the story is the struggle by Jackie to get the ""Anthrax II"" away from the baddies and rescue the girl!  Why do they keep chopping and changing Jackie's movies?

1438344,4,B00005JKN6,"Jackie Chan makes Kung Fu movies, and this is his latest. If that turns you off, then, just as I did, you have a delightful surprise in store for you. You see, I thought Kung Fu movies were like American action movies. You know the type: what limp excuse there is for a plot is just an excuse to tie together as many fight scenes, car chases, and explosions as possible in under an hour and a half. The good guy is a little dark, but that's just because he's misunderstood. The bad guys are disgusting, evil caricatures just begging to be removed from the gene pool. Jackie Chan is quite different. For one thing, his tough guy characters are not so much dark and misunderstood as bewildered and bumbling. (How can a guy who does Kung Fu moves like Chan does appear bumbling? I don't know, but if you can imagine a cross between Bruce Lee and Jerry Lewis, Chan is that guy.) Instead of staging everything to make himself look as tough as possible, Chan invites you to laugh at him as he somehow bumbles his way through to victory. For instance, near the end of this film, there is a hilarious sequence I call ""the fan dance"" where Chan's character, chased out of a Turkish steam bath, tries to fight off the bad guys and keep his private parts covered at the same time. If the sequence doesn't make you gasp at Chan's amazing moves, you will be gasping for breath, simply from laughing so hard. And, yes, Chan's moves are simply amazing. He uses props extravagantly, bouncing and rolling off stairways, balconies, escalators, and other characters. Even knowing that all the moves are choreographed, I find myself amazed that anybody can move like that. And, well, yes, there are fights, car chases, and explosions, but there is this tremendous sense of fun running through it all which makes Chan's films an utter delight.",1021248000,,1822,4.574923547400612

7938982,3,B00005JKN6,"What fans and non-Chan fans are sure to remember about ""The Accidental Spy"" is the memorable sequence involving Chan fighting in and being chased out of a Turkish bath (courtesy of much of the film taking place in Istanbul) and running through a bazaar naked trying to cover up his privates.  Though some fans may decry Chan doing nudity (he shows his bare bottom) this whole sequence is a delight, wonderfully imbued with Chan's impish comedy and quick witted dexterity as he uses any item available as a defensive weapon and to cover himself.  It easily deserves to be up there in one of the top 20 classic moments of Jackie's film career!  (And the double-dip into spices that has his bottom colored red and yellow is a hoot!)

That being said the rest of the film is fairly dour, showcasing JC in an intentionally dramatic role wherein he plays a man who was raised an orphan and is now selling exercise equipment.  He gets lured into meeting a man who may have been his father (and maybe not) who was a double agent operating out of Korea.  This man enigmatically puts Jackie up to a task that can leave him an heir to a fortune.  Jackie takes up the task and soon finds himself over his head but not outclassed by the criminals who are hunting him down (is it for the money? is it for drugs?).  Following clues that are none too clear to us (the audience) he wends his way through one predicament after another, narrowly escaping death in a number of sequences that are not his finest and usually rehashed from earlier movies (the bit in and out of the cars reminded me of a scene from ""Mr. Nice Guy"" if I remember correctly).  He also falls for a drug addict whom he tries to save but she doesn't make it.

The overall tone of the film is somber, and it ends with Jackie saving the day as he has sacrificed his reward, he being the noble soul concerned more about others than himself.  But then why does it end up feeling so hollow?  Perhaps because we have rooted for his character to have some happiness (material good; meaningful relational connection) but he doesn't seem to; he seems lonely at movie's end.  There are a couple of scenes in the movie where he flashes his warm, funny smile and it lights up the screen but otherwise that misleading cover sleeve will lead the consumer to believe that they're in for a movie more in the vein of the American ""Operation Condor"" (""Armor of God II"").  Don't be deceived, you're not.

7938985,5,B00005JKN6,"You can't go wrong with Jackie.  This is definitely one of my favorite Jackie Chan movies!  The plot's twists and turns will keep you guessing 'till the very end.  Jackie does some of his best fighting, stunts, and choreography in this film.  Entertaining from start to finish!  A must have for any Jackie Chan fan, action movie lover, or just someone who enjoys spending 2 hours with an awesome movie.  Worth every penny!",1276300800,,422,4.712328767123288
