However, the Oxford Dictionary's definition of folk music is ""traditional music of unknown authorship, transmitted orally"".  By this criterion, I make the total number of folk tunes here to be about two.

So if that is the kind of folk music you want, best look elsewhere.

The star turn for me is Pete & Judy :-)

The total time is around 90 minutes",1403222400,37,2052,4.747191011235955

8509371,5,B0073O7SGK,"This is the best history I have ever seen of the Folk Revival of the 1950's and 1960's.

While I had always thought of the modern folk music era starting with The Kingston Trio, this program starts with a fabulous old black and white video of Harry Belafonte. John Sebastian is correct - Belafonte's Calypso songs are the first folk music I remember hearing back in the '50's.

Look at the groups that are included in this video and you will see that he has covered the field very well.",1344384000,16,486,4.388888888888889
