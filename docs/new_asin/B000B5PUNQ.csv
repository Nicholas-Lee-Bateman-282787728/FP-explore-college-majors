If Paleoanthropology is your thing,  Buy this DVD!  5 Stars!",1370736000,,258,5.2439024390243905
8324964,4,B000B5PUNQ,"I have made good use of this program for several years in an introductory-level college anthropology class.  To be sure, there is a pretty heavy environmental determinist message here, but one can readily overcome that in subsequent class discussion.

I have only just discovered an incredibly frustrating fact of which other educators may wish to be aware.  Specifically, this DVD does not come with close captioning or subtitles that can be activitated as needed.  In fact, the Discovery Channel's website FAQs baldly state that this is not a service they provide for their programming.  Nor are transcripts available.

I am very disheartened to learn that a vendor whose materials should otherwise be used profitably in the college classroom has such utter disregard for the Americans with Disabilities Act and the reality that their users might well include deaf students who need either close captioning/subtitles or a transcript so as to fully benefit from their programs.

Many educators purchase items for classroom use at our own expense.  Maybe we should only support vendors who are committed to meeting the needs of the full range of students we serve. As currently formatted, this program fails in that regard.",1299801600,3,1223,5.204081632653061
