8682502,5,B00O8AG2ZU,"I previously had bought Rome Seasons 1 and 2 on Blu-ray (the fancy cardboard packaging from their original release), but I was moved to buy this because it has the coveted digital copy. It is an amazing show, despite only being two seasons. I recommend it to everyone I know. The only thing that bothers me is that I can't for the life of me find Rome Season 2 in this format (that is, with the digital copy). I hope Amazon starts carrying it so I can own both seasons on digital and watch it on any device.",1454716800,,507,4.183673469387755
