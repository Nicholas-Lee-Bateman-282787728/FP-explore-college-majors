8589323,4,B003V924U6,"Everything Is Terrible has become notorious for and synonymous with repurposed, crazily edited vestiges from the worst of VHS. Although ""2 Everything 2 Terrible II: Tokyo Drift"" isn't as up to the stratospheric standards of the 3-DVD set ""Everything Is Terrible"", and definitely can't approach the astounding ""Doggiewoggiez! Poochiewoochiez!"" for brilliance, there is still plenty of fun to be had here along with a couple of pieces that will try your soul.

This DVD reuses occasional pieces of video from other Everything Is Terrible productions, but with the way it's edited it's really no problem. Frequently while watching this you will be astonished at some of the concepts and dialogue (""How would you like to be tied up and tickled for several hours?"" asks a video on llama care), and occasionally annoyed at how far out of the lines the producers went here (a 10-year old Hitler impersonator is never a good idea).

The DVD is broken into big sections that are rather amorphously defined. Starting with ""Best Of"" we actually see some of the best work from the group. ""It's a Princess Party"" is a horrible self-indulgent ode to consumerism in a party-tips-for-kids format. It's absolutely ghastly, but ""How to Break Into Heavy Metal"" is equally hilarious as it explains why the most important thing mind-addled rockers need is a good attorney. Like the unpalatable juvenile Hitler impersonator, ""Duckmen VI"" goes beyond the bounds of good taste in a duck hunting video that loves to linger on the dying ducks writhing in agony. I actually knocked a star off this otherwise stellar review for occasional lapses like this. It's just never funny to watch suffering. Getting over the fowl trauma, ""Milk is Sweet, Bro"" is a great antidote to depression, what with its rapping about cows and all. Finally, perhaps the greatest event of the whole collection opens ""It's time for cat massage!"" This cat massage video is absolute comedy gold. With tips like ""A whisker watch alert is in effect here!"" and ""Remember, you can't fool drool!"", this is a segment to watch anytime you need an emotional boost. Alas, all good things must come to an end, and ""Glorious Scarves"" brings you back from your cat massage-induced natural high. (Scarves? Really?) ""Facial Magick"" is a really unconventional facial exercise program that will make your jaw drop. For the romantic in you, pay attention to ""Intro to Smooching"" which explains various kisses to include ""The Trobriand Islands Kiss"" (Where? What? Anyway, don't try that one on a first date), and perhaps my favorite ""The Vacuum Kiss"". No, really. Please try to forget the ""Billy Bob Teeth"" instructional video. If you don't it will haunt your nightmares.

Everything Is Terrible is famous for their condensed movies, and here there are a selection of ""3 Minute Movies"" for your enjoyment. Some are boring, but some are fabulous. Some of these, I am ashamed to admit, I have actually seen. ""The Jupiter Menace"" with George Kennedy kicks things off with a Biblical prophecy of doom theme about Jupiter and Uranus. The cataclysm happens in the year 2000, so enjoy the survivalist tips to get you prepared. High camp stuff. By far the greatest of these films is ""Bulletproof"" starring Gary Busey who claims he is your worst nightmare and uses the word ""Butthorn"" a lot. This is so awesome I actually stopped the DVD and went online and bought a copy of the original movie. This is almost as good as cat massage! ""Unborn 2"" is, on the other hand, not especially funny though it is cringeworthy. Really, nobody notices the horrible mutant baby is a killer? Yawn. ""Deadly Prey"" should have been titled ""Mullet Mercenary"" and is noteworthy for the scene where the protagonist beats a guy to death with his own arm. Don't ask, just watch. ""Little Bigfoot"" is one that I've seen. I definitely recommend the 3-minute version instead of an unabridged viewing. ""Supervan"" is another one I have seen and it's a wonder of cheese. From the van (named ""Vandora"") to the attendance at ""Freakout '76"", everything about this movie is perfect. ""Collision Course"" stars Jay Leno and Pat Morita (!) in a horribly-conceived buddy cop movie. I am looking forward to watching the uncut version. ""Death Drug"" may have the lowest production values of any of these movies, as it's basically a just say no to angel dust morality play, though there is a wonderful scene in which a hairbrush turns into an alligator. Finally, there's ""Lords of Magick"" a really cheesy mess that's so amazing I just bought a copy on VHS (as it's the only format you can find it in). Let's just say that this justifies the price of purchase of this DVD by itself.

The next section is called ""Music Videos"" and I have no clue where they found these but they are not your normal cable TV fodder. Starting strong with ""The Carrot Highway"", a song about carrot farming which is great and totally weird (and hard to get out of your mind), the other big attraction here is an astonishing headphone promotional video from Koss, ""Koss Can't Be Beat"", which involves people dressed casually in military fatigues and berets singing and rapping while dancing with severe rhythm impairment. I cannot imagine who the Koss marketing department thought they were going to impress with this fiasco, but I guarantee you won't forget it!

""2 Everything 2 Terrible II: Tokyo Drift"" is a very good compilation with a couple of annoying exceptions, and if you like found footage or other Everything Is Terrible productions, you'll be sure to seek out a copy while you can. If you are new to the concept, start with the more readily available ""Everything Is Terrible"" 3-DVD set. It's truly amazing and not just a little terrifying to see what's out there. Thanks for the weirdness!",1452211200,,5754,4.873340143003064
