392727,4,6301971779,"This almost forgotten 1933 film - which was directed by the notorious Hungarian Michael Curtiz - is a good showcase for the diverse talents of Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Glenda Farrell.  In 1921 London, Mr. Igor's critically successful wax museum is burned down by his partner for the insurance money.  Igor is trapped in the flames and all of his work is destroyed. But he survives the tragedy.  Jumping to dozen years later, the film takes the viewer on a fascinating journey into revenge, betrayal and madness...An unjustly forgotton - for the most part, anyway - little flick: it was feared missing for many years.  Luckily a print survived.  Lionel Atwill is excellent, Fay Wray is lovely and as the snappy, wise-cracking Florence, Glenda Farrell is in top form. The last film to be made in the old two-colour Technicolor process, its working title was WAX MUSEUM.  According to modern sources, the extreme heat needed to process the old two-colour method literally melted the wax figurines - so in most scenes, the figures were played by actors.  Fascinating. Horror fans will undoubtedly compare this to Price's 1953 epic HOUSE OF WAX: in both films the ""cracking face"" segments are superb.",1043712000,,1198,4.930348258706467
392728,4,6301971779,"Lionel Atwill is the artist and owner of a London wax museum that is torched by his partner to get the insurance money.  Years later, having been injured in the blaze, Atwill turns up in New York, preparing a new wax museum for opening. If only he could quickly re-create some of his lost masterpieces.  But of course, he's gone a little mad and he comes up with a way .... Enter Fay Wray, the spitting image of his lost Marie Antoinette.  Hmmm.  I'm sure you get the idea.  This is a most unusual Warner Brothers' early Thirties film.  Filmed in an early, two strip Technicolor, the film has a remarkable, almost unreal feeling about it, much like the wax figures.  It's an unusual subject and genre for the studio to have tackled, but director Michael Curtiz keeps the action moving, so the film never gets dull.  Atwill is appropriately creepy, Wray screams with the best of them, and Glenda Farrell, as the wisecracking, adventurous reporter out to expose it all, steals the show with her lively, energetic performance.  It's got the thrills and the humour necessary to entertain, plus a few memorable moments.",1016323200,7,1114,4.701030927835052
392729,3,6301971779,Some good shocks with comic relief.  This film is worth the purchase if for nothing else than the early technicolor (2 strip). Brenda Farrell is great as the smarty reporter looking for the story but Fay Wray is the real centerpiece.  Highly recommended for Fay Wray fans.  She's still my favorite 30's sexy star.  The film carries a little too much amusement and too little tension for my tastes but Fay's presence made it all worthwhile.,1008892800,,439,4.7368421052631575

392767,5,6301971779,"Although most people are more familiar with its 1953 remake, HOUSE OF WAX, the original 1933 MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM is the better version of the story about a deranged, disfigured sculptor who replaces his lost statues with dead bodies coated in wax. Both films were produced by Warner Bros., and both featured a novelty when they came out: MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM offered two-strip Technicolor and HOUSE OF WAX was in 3-D. Gimmicks aside, the earlier film retains a pervasive, creepy ambience that the showier remake lacks. The original was made and takes place in the freer, pre-code era of the early '30's, and has that wonderful urban, streetwise edge that Warners excelled in. It's also quite frank in its depiction of bootlegging and drug addiction, and rather kinky in its suggestion of necrophilia. Next to this stuff the sanitized remake seems pretty tame by comparison.

Essentially a follow-up to Warners' equally worthy DOCTOR X released the year before, WAX MUSEUM shares the same director and three cast members. The multi-genred Michael Curtiz helmed both films which contain several typical Curtiz devices such as swift pacing, crackling dialog, fluid camerawork, and dramatically cast shadows. Anton Grot's expressionistic sets with their oblique angles and low ceilings conjure up memories of THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI (Decla Film, 1919), while the limited color palette gives off a chilling atmosphere that serves the premise well.

Fresh from playing the lead in DOCTOR X, Lionel Atwill gives perhaps his finest performance as the snapped sculptor, Ivan Igor, whom we can't help but feel sorry for since he is a victim of a criminal act just as much as he is a perpetrator. When an evil, greedy partner played by slimy Edwin Maxwell sets his museum ablaze destroying his life's work and leaving him disabled, we can understand Igor's anguish and descent into insanity even though we can't condone his grisly method of replacing the mannequins. Breezy Glenda Farrell is great as the wisecracking reporter investigating the case, and she keeps things clipping along with her engaging manner. There's some amusing banter between Farrell and her harassed editor, a rare role of authority for Frank McHugh who's usually someone's comic sidekick.

 Second-billed Fay Wray is first on Atwill's list of victims because of her uncanny resemblance to his lost waxen masterpiece, Marie Antoinette. Wray, who had just been menaced by the Moon Killer in DOCTOR X and soon to be nabbed by the giant ape in KING KONG (RKO, 1933), has less screen time than Farrell in WAX MUSEUM, but makes up for it by sharing the juiciest scenes with Atwill. Most famous is the unmasking, handled much better here than in the remake, where Wray pounds her fists on Atwill's handsome features revealing the hideously scarred face underneath. The build-up to this scene is terrific as we follow Wray deeper into the cavernous museum through forbidding corridors and down winding stairways. Besides living up to her legendary reputation as the ultimate scream queen, the lovely Miss Wray teases us with a bit of fetishism doing leg lifts in a sweater and shorts before putting her stockings on - and looking quite sumptuous in Technicolor.

 Rounding out the cast is Gavin Gordon as a millionaire playboy whom Farrell ditches for McHugh, and one of the suspects in DOCTOR X, Arthur Edmund Carewe as Atwill's cocaine addicted assistant/confidante.

Warner Home Video's transfer of MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM looks really nice and sharp, with crisp sound. For an example of a different kind of '30's horror film, take a tour through this rogues' gallery of chills with genre favorites Lionel Atwill and the fab Fay Wray as your guides.

392768,5,6301971779,"Other reviewers can talk about the film itself (highly recommended); this is a review of this particular DVD pressing.

I bought this to see if it was different than the transfer found on side B of the ""House Of Wax"" (1953) DVD, but it's the same transfer. My only problem with this already-available transfer is that they digitally added ""blue"" to the two-strip technicolor process. Although that does result in a more natural color scheme (and it's a neat trick), it's historically inaccurate. Two-strip technicolor was notorious for leaving out blue, instead giving you a palette of greens and oranges. It would be nice to have this film in the original color scheme as is the case with the similar ""Doctor X"" (1932) DVD. Having said that, this disc is still worth watching.

It's also heartening to find that these DVDs are re-packaged leftovers from the deluxe DVD version of the horrid Paris Hilton version of ""House of Wax"". I guess no one bought that DVD, but WB figured more people would be interested in a technicolor gem from 1933 than in a forgettable dud from 2006.

392793,4,6301971779,"KING KONG immortalized Fay Wray but she obviously also did other motion pictures. In fact, she did other pictures in the same year KING KONG was released. Case in point, THE VAMPIRE BAT and MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM, both 1933 fright films. Both are well done and prep you and me for the impending Halloween. MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM, THE VAMPIRE BAT, and KING KONG are October staples in my household, as is another Fay Wray spine-tingler, DOCTOR X.

The film opens in London, 1921, on a dark evening. It introduces us to Ivan Igor (Lionel Atwill), a wax sculptor as masterful with his craft as he is detached. But his wax museum had been steadily losing money, what with Igor refusing to create pieces that are macabre and lurid and, y'know, crowd-pleasing. His disenchanted partner wants to burn the place down and collect on the fire insurance. The ensuing struggle results in tragedy and launches a horror.

Cut to present day 1933, the venue shifted to New York. A new wax museum is about to open down on 14th Street, but that's almost incidental news. The papers are screaming out news of a missing girl. And dogged reporter Florence Dempsey (Glenda Farrell) is maybe isn't as dogged as advertised. The New York Express editor (Frank McHugh) threatens to fire Florence unless she comes up with a big story. And, by the way, here I was propping up Fay Wray when it's actually Warner Brothers regular, Glenda Farrell, who is the show's true female lead. She's aces as the reporter; I dig her moxie and snappy patter and the enthusiasm in which she propels the narrative. With this film released just before the pre-code era ended, Farrell manages to squeeze in one racy remark to a cop (""How's your sex life"").

Florence decides to dig into the missing girl story and her snooping leads her to a case of a stolen corpse at the morgue. She unearths an alarming fact: eight bodies had been stolen in the past 18 months. She stumbles to sinister goings-on at the new wax museum. She meets the museum director, the very same Ivan Igor, twelve years older, wheelchaired, his once gifted hands transformed to mangled claws. Today, Ivan Igor is reduced to directing lesser artists in wax. He's probably okay with it. Probably. There probably wasn't that much venom in his remark to one bumbling apprentice: ""It is a cruel irony that you people without souls... should have hands.""

Want some trivia shoved down your throat? Okay. MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM presents an interesting look, right? To paraphrase TCM host Robert Osborne, MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM was filmed using an early color process called ""2-strip technicolor,"" of which colors consisted of basic green and red. Two years later the more sophisticated ""3-strip technicolor"" came around which embraced all the colors in the spectrum and pretty much kicked 2-strip technicolor to the curb. Now, actual wax figures were commissioned for the film, but the 2-strip technicolor process demanded extra lights to record a clearer image. The lights ended up melting the wax dummies and so real people had to be substituted in for them, except that they could only endure the hot lamps for seconds at a time.

MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM is directed by Michael Curtiz who was so no-nonsense even bomb disposal units asked him, ""Why the rush?"" But his resume speaks for itself, the number of memorable pictures he'd helmed. MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM moves fast, is framed beautifully, is atmospheric from jump. It builds up the tension to a crescendo, to that moment when lovely, trapped victim Fay Wray claws at the face of the demented serial killer and ushers in one of them gruesome Grand Guignol moments. Or to quote our snooping reporter who'd caught an earlier glimpse: ""I don't know what he was, but he made Frankenstein look like a lily.""",1349740800,2,3798,4.76595744680851

392797,5,6301971779,"Read other reviews for a description of the plot.  I just want to evaluate a few things.  No spoilers here.

Mystery Of The Wax Museum (1933) is a campy but scary movie starring Lionel Atwill, Glenda Farrell, Fay Wray, Frank McHugh, Edwin Maxwell, Monica Bannister, and others.  It's one of the earliest Technicolor films, using a two-color system.  The movie's colors aren't exactly true to life (lots of pinks and light blues are the result of red and green dyes being used), but it was a breakthrough that paved the way for the improved Technicolor system a few years later.

I feel this movie is just as strong as the 1953 remake called House Of Wax, starring Vincent Price.  While I think Vincent Price was perfect for the role of the wax museum sculptor Professor Henry Jarrod, I also think Lionel Atwill was great in the same role as Ivan Igor.  He has a kind of creepy look about him that's unsettling.  Glenda Farrell and Fay Wray also give great performances, especially Farrell.

I own the House Of Wax double feature DVD that also has Mystery Of The Wax Museum included (see my review), but I also wanted to review Mystery Of The Wax Museum separately, so here it is.

The movie is pretty campy while being scary at the same time.  If you like scary movies that take place in dark and creepy places like wax museums, then this movie as well as House Of Wax (1953) are your movies.

I highly recommend them.",1285286400,6,1418,4.513725490196078

392804,5,6301971779,"Mystery of the Wax Museum easily stands up sixty years after it was made as a truly unique piece of film.  Possibly quite thrilling in its day though it was, it has effectivly materialized to the contemporary audience as a thickly amusing black comedy.  It boasts priceless performances by Fay Wray as the darling tenderfoot (soon to be preserved in wax) Charlote, and her alter ego the narcissistic, over zealous pure gem of a character Florence; a failed reporter who seeks only justice and a rich husband.

Beyond the classic characters of Charlotte and Florence (the latter played by Glenda Farrel) and her two potential suitors the millionare charged with murder and the gruff, insulting newspaper editor with a heart, are the strange collection of people in the museum itself; the unfazed caricature deaf-mute artist, the junkie perfectionist, Charlotte's besotted, albeit wimpy fiance Ralph and of course Igor himself, a wheelchair bound, burned, pitiful but passionate wax master condemned to instruct 'soulless people with hands' to recreate the beautiful wax figures that were melted in a fire twelve years earlier.

Filmed to brilliant use in early two-color technicolor, this film is full of atmosphere both dark and funny.  It flows hauntingly with that uncertain but intriguing sense there hides in all dark corners things unseen and the eye is drawn, almost magnetized to the blackest purple shadows in every shot, just awaiting something hideous that may be lurking.  Somehow this atmosphere so effectivly lingers below without pretense while the quirky, fast unfolding mystery and the quaint 1930s wit plays straight up to the front... this film really deserves six stars.",1147392000,3,1689,5.237037037037037
392805,4,6301971779,"The Mystery of the Wax Museum was the first film that spawned two remakes titled House of Wax. The story revolves around a reporter who suspects that the bodies that have been disappearing at the morgue are finding themselves inside a museum molded as famous characters from history.

This film is filmed in an early form of Technicolor, a much more faded tone than was used later mostly in frivolous films. However, although a horror/drama film is the last place one would expect to see color, it is done well and is another reason to see the film.

Lionel Atwill plays the sinister owner of the museum. His character had his own display in London, but after a fire, he was unable to sculpt out of wax. Although his character is obviously mentally disturbed, he is strangely easy to empathize with and one feels sorry for him. His character is the epitome of a role suited for Lon Chaney, but sadly, he was dead by this time.

Fay Wray plays a girl who is dating an employee at the Wax Museum. She is discovered as being an exact look-alike of the owner's statue of Marie Antoinette back in London. She is obviously the victim with very little to do or say with much meaning. Wray is used as decoration and a pair of lungs in this film.

Glenda Farrell is a riot as the snappy reporter, the true star of the show. She looks older in color than in her black and white films, but she is loads of fun.

The horror aspects of this film run a little slowly and had the pace been sped up a bit the film could have been much scarier. As it stands, this movie is more like, as the title suggests, a mystery than a horror film.

This movie was made before the production code which restricted many things that could be in scripts. This one gallivants nude sculptures which is risqu because of the assertion that there are real bodies underneath. Sex is mentioned, and so is bootlegging.

The print is slightly damaged and the soundtrack occasionally jumps so that it is incongruent with the action in the scene, but it fixes itself quickly. It would be nice to see this film cleaned up and released on DVD.

You watch Vincent Price in ""House of Wax"" (if you are lucky, which I was not, in 3-D), and some time later on you learn that director Andr De Toth's 1953 film was based on a film made twenty years earlier entitled, ""Mystery of the Wax Museum.""  That might not be enough to persuade fans of horror movies involving dead bodies covered in wax to go back and check out director Michael Curtiz's 1933 film, but I bet I can tip the odds in favor of doing so by pointing out that not only is ""Mystery"" slightly better than ""House,"" but that  it also has the advantage of Fay Wray in the cast.  She is not really the female star of this film, but she should be enough of a hook for those who have never seen the film she did right before ""King Kong,"" when Wray was most definitely a scream queen having made ""Doctor X,"" ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" and ""The Vampire Bat"" for Warner Bros.

""Mystery of the Wax Museum"" begins in 1912 London, where Ivan Igor (Lionel Atwill, who also did ""Doctor X"" and ""The Vampire Bat"") lovingly creates his wax figures.  However, the museum is losing money and his business partner torches the place for the insurance money and Igor is caught in the inferno (Igor as a last name just seems so wrong to me).  Then we jump ahead to 1933 New York City, where Igor, confined to a wheelchair and unable to use his hands because of the fire, has opened a new wax museum.  On New Year's Eve beautiful socialite Joan Gale (Monica Bannister) dies from an overdose (pre-code movie, obviously) and her rich boyfriend George Winton (Gavin Gordon) is arrested for murder.  That is when acid-tongued reporter Florence Dempsey (Glenda Farrell) becomes involved in the case.  She thinks Winton is innocent and when Gale's body disappears, Florence starts snooping around the wax museum.  Meanwhile, Igor has taken a fancy to Charlotte Duncan (Wray), whose fianc Ralph Burton (Allen Vincent) is working as a sculptor there.  This cannot be a good thing and while the cops think she has a screw loose, Florence is going to figure to find out what is happening at the wax museum.

Granted, ""House of Wax"" is a much better looking film with its rich and vibrant colors making ""Mystery of the Wax Museum"" look like its colors have been bleached out.  But that just represents the improvement of color technology over two decades.  Whichever film you see first the second will obviously hold no suspense since the story is essentially the same from start to finish (unlike the 2005 splatter flick version of ""House of Wax"" which appropriates the name but not the plot).  Ultimately the key difference between the two is the character of Florence.  Wray has the gams but Farrell has the gums in this one, shaving at least five minutes off the running time by how fast she talks with Jim (Frank McHugh), her editor.  Farrell had been in ""I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"" and would go on to appear in a whole bunch of films as Torchy Blane, in which I assume she plays the same sort of tough broad she plays here as she steals the movie from the two stars.

""Mystery"" has a screenplay by Carl Erickson & Don Mullaly, based on a play by Charles Belden, and the idea of watching a play where there might have been wax statues coming life is intriguing (I know nothing about the play, but my imagination is running away from me at the thought).  Anyhow, the whole creepy idea of corpses becoming art that we see in films like ""Bucket of Blood,"" ""Blood Bath,"" and ""Nightmare in Wax"" gets traced back to this film and that stage drama.",1130284800,,3604,4.481651376146789
392807,4,6301971779,"Bodies disappear from the morgue and coincidentally, wax figures are added to the local wax museum which resemble the missing corpses. I have never forgotten this film since the first time I saw it. It's really amazing how creepy this film is. You can tell this movie has had some influence over some of the movies from the past 20-25 years. All the acting is great, the script is suspenseful and the way this movie was shot just adds to the terror of the whole picture. Highly recommended.",1094515200,2,490,4.579545454545454
392808,3,6301971779,"Generally overshadowed by its more famous remake (""House of Wax"" featuring Vincent Price), ""Mystery of the Wax Museum"" is a more than respectable horror vehicle in its own right.  The story of a newly-opened New York wax museum and the strangely lifelike figures that its bizarre owner populates it with, this was a highly original entry into the 1930's horror scene.  It was probably intended to compete with the Universal bumper crop of horror staples (Dracula, Frankenstein, et al) and if it cannot quite equal those masterpieces it is nonetheless distinctly more realistic and retains its own unique charm. Surprisingly racy for its day, ""Mystery"" may be more credible in modern horror fans' eyes than similar films from the same period.  The film's cast is excellent, with Lional Atwill as the deranged sculptor to whom art is more precious than life, Fay Wray as the alluring damsel in distress, and Glenda Farrell in a superbly convincing role as the fast-talking, wisecracking reporter who discovers the wax museum's terrible secret. The whole is photographed in a rare two-strip early tecnicolor process which lends a unique, eerie air to every scene.  There's some effective comic relief (especially from the aforementioned Farrell) and the infamous ""face-cracking"" scene is a real shocker, especially for a viewer who has never seen either version of the story before. A relatively slow pace that should've been spiced up a bit is the only reason I don't give this gem four stars, though the climax is certainly exciting and a great wrap-up.  An overall quality production that is miles ahead of most of the drudgery that passes for horror today.  Recommended to any fan of vintage screamers or classic cinema.",1086652800,4,1721,5.085106382978723

7818502,4,6301971779,"Mystery of the Wax Museum holds a special place in film history as the last of the two strip technicolor films.

Using color in films began with tinting entire sequences (e.g., The Great Train Robbery) and later hand painting scenes (e.g., Birth of a Nation, Intolerance). Technicolor films started as early as 1917 when they used a single lens and a beam splitter. This system continued through 1922, with little commercial success due to the problems in showing the film. In 1922 they developed System 2 and produced Toll of the Sea. It was highly profitable, and the technique was used in a few scenes in Cecil B DeMilles Ten Commandments (1923) and Jesse Laskys Wanderer of the Wasteland (1924). This process was superior because it required no special projection techniques, but the prints were subject to problems and

System 3 (the one used in this film) was invented in 1928. This new technique was used in films like The Viking (1928) and Mysterious Island (1929). Process 3 was improved in 1931, eliminated the specks that often appeared in the films, and reduced the production costs. It was this process that was used to make this film. Warner  Bros. had planned to do 6 films using this technique, but only made 3 (including this one). Other studios also planned to go into this process more, but limited box office stalled their efforts. The next process (4) was quickly adopted by Walt Disney (Silly Symphonies, 1933) and became the standard, mostly in cartoons, but also in a few films (e.g., Becky Sharp). When Disney released Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs (1937) the new technique took off and was prominent in 1939 films like GWTW and Wizard of Oz.

So enjoy this look back in film history. The story is jumbled and some of the acting is over the top (Fay Wray screams even more than she did when held by King Kong), but the technology is the treat here.",1471046400,,1871,4.677811550151976

The 1933 film is not as scary as the 1953  remake. But it is great old-time mystery/horror movie.  Incredibly, this 1933 movie is in color. I thought Fay Wray's (who also starred in the 1933 Hong Cong movie ) character was too silly for a serious role, but overall I still give it 5 stars because it is a thrilling classic.  The old-time actor from England, Lionel  Atwill, like Vincent Price in 1953, was superb as the disfigured sculptor.",1429401600,,600,4.378378378378378
