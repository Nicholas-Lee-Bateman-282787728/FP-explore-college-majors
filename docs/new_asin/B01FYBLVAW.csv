7752204,2,B01FYBLVAW,"Gargoyles is a great series but not this one from Shopville. This Disney Deluxe Boxed Set is a fraud.  Nothing special about this set, no box no extras and over priced.  You are better off buying the series separately and save twenty dollars.  The series is excellent especially now that Season 2 Vol. 2 is available.  But Volume 2 is every toned down from the others, no pictured discs no detail of series and they are packaged one on top of the other.",1486425600,29,453,4.421686746987952

8761808,1,B01FYBLVAW,"This set is the complete series of 'Gargoyles' but for die-hard fans, it is incomplete as this set does not contain the second series (incorrectly refereed to as season 3) ""The Goliath Chronicles"". The second series picks up shortly after the original and follows the Gargoyles as they struggle to survive in a world that now knows of their existence and seeks to hunt them to extinction. We see the introduction of new characters as well as the return of our favorites. The art style is modernized and a lot more flirty then the original series. If Elisa is your fav character you'll either love her or hate her. The art style, colors, and story plots also takes on a more dramatic, violent, and dark approach which resulted in a more real-world ring that the original series lacked. Unlike the original, this series presents the bulk of the episodes as a first person narrative, primarily by Goliath; each episode containing a learning point on morals, ethics, and values. The length is a single season about 13 episodes. You can find VHS home recordings put to DVD on sites like ebay from time to time. There was also a petition going around the internet in the early to mid 2000's to have the remainder of the series and the Goliath Chronicles released to DVD. We only got season 2 in answer.",1526774400,2,1296,4.639130434782609
