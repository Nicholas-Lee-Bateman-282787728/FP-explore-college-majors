1788786,3,B00006RCL9,"When I read this book as a kid, I absolutely loved it...purchased the book as an adult and re-read it and still loved it.  The movie however I found lacking.  Honestly, they couldn't find a Husky to play the part?  The fact that he is Kavik the Wolf Dog being played by a German Sheperd was very annoying.  Anyone that knows dogs and loves dog stories will be disappointed by this fact.",1315872000,,386,4.319444444444445

1788789,1,B00006RCL9,"I purchased this dvd at a Best Buy store for $4.99, and after watching a few minutes of it, realized I wasted my money. There is not a single time during the course of this movie that there isn't dirt, grain etc all over the picture. With the technology available today, this could be digitally remastered and cleaned up. Avoid this dvd at all costs! It's a shame it's a good movie and deserves a better edition. I will be very careful in the future when buying movies from Goodtimes entertainment.",1085443200,4,498,4.483516483516484
