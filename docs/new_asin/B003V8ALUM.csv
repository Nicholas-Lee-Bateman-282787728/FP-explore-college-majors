8421307,5,B003V8ALUM,"When I found this musical on the vast expanses of the inter-webs, I was happy. When I found it with Spanish subtitles (I know just enough to get by), I was thrilled. Then I discovered that, since I have an all-region DVD player, I could buy it on DVD. I was ecstatic. Then, WAY before I was expecting it to arrive, seeing as how it had to cross an ocean, IT ARRIVED AND I WATCHED IT FIVE TIMES IN THREE DAYS AND IT WAS FABULOUS AND ALL THE TEARS WERE HAD AND MUCH LAUGHTER AND HEARTBREAK. Oh my. Doesn't even matter to me that there are no English subtitles, because the actors are fabulous and body language is universal. The variety of music is wonderful, as there are songs that fit any mood I'm in.

It's so wonderful. I love it.",1411344000,2,912,4.434523809523809
