8681677,5,B00O2QWFWE,"Outstanding movie. I first heard of this incident when I was a freshman in HS. I saw the book at the city library and decided to read it. it was about 1300 pages long. The captain was railroaded pure and simple. but if you like historically accurate movies, this is a great buy and a keeper.",1529884800,,291,4.214285714285714

8681681,5,B00O2QWFWE,"I watched this movie a few years back. I was shocked to learn about the story. I mean the ACCURATE story, not the one Quint tells on the Orca in Jaws. There's a very touching scene at a reunion with all of them singing that song about ""for those in peril on the sea"". I wish I could remember it. I think it's a popular Christian hymn. Anyhow, I like the song very much, love this movie, and just read a book about the tragedy entitled ""Abandon Ship !"" by Richard Newcomb, which I also recommend. It gives a detailed description of the days leading up to the attack on the Indianapolis, the  the attack itself and the goings-on afterward. But back to the movie. Stunningly portrayed, very heart-wrenching, and entertaining. Two thumbs up.",1487894400,,737,4.5
8681682,5,B00O2QWFWE,"Great movie about a terrible tragedy.  We were privileged to have known one of the ""lucky ones.""",1487635200,,96,4.647058823529412
8681683,5,B00O2QWFWE,"Like Quint said in the movie Jaws, ""Anyway, we delivered the bomb."" Good movie, good cast. Based on the true story of the U.S.S. Indianapolis mission to deliver the Hiroshima bomb and the subsequent torpedoing and sinking of the ship. Many a good man lost his life to shorten the war in the Pacific. We owe them much.",1468713600,4,317,4.482758620689655
