6228909,5,B00HVBB16I,"I was so happy to randomly stumble upon this new re-release of Season 2 Part 1. Unlike the previous release that had all of season 2 on it, It breaks up Season 2 into two 2 disc DVD sets. I wanted to add some Dr Who to my DVD collection but I didn't want to spend a lot on those older box sets. The pricing on these DVD's are wonderful under 20 bucks for 2 discs of 7 episodes. The only drawback is the special feature. Its a 24 minute making of Season 2 Part 1 and its underwhelming, they just touch on each episode for 5 minutes.

I look forward to buying Season 2 Part 2 and Season 3 Parts 1 and 2. I just hope Season 4 gets this treatment as well.",1399766400,4,651,3.8582089552238807
6228910,4,B00HVBB16I,Just ordered mine today so I don't know much but I have been soooo waiting for series 2 to come along at a price I can afford. Thank you oh thank you amazon for fling this!,1397692800,,172,3.8055555555555554
6228911,5,B00HVBB16I,"In my view, David Tennant embodies the Doctor far better than Christopher Eccleston ever did. Tennant has 1000% more charm, personality, and yes, even sex appeal(so I've been told by the ladies). It's a ton of fun to see him as the new doctor in ""The Christmas Invasion"", even if he is absent for most of the episode, his awakening makes the whole experience so fun and worthwhile.

Where this first half shines is also in episodes such as ""School Reunion"". Longtime fans of Doctor Who might want to break out the Kleenex as they see their old friend Sarah Jane Smith and the ever lovable K-9 coming back to kick some Krillitane butt. Okay, that's not the Doctor's way, but you get the idea.

Another great standalone episode is the epic Victorian themed ""The Girl in the fireplace"". There are definitely elements here that may have gone on to inspire the wonderful character arc of Amelia Pond throughout her sublime journey with the Doctor. Perhaps the episode was meant to foreshadow that in a way, and like the design of many aliens/robots/machines/etc on Doctor who, everything is epic and conveys a staggeringly amazing use of imagination with just a sprinkle of whimsy here and there.

Things get emotional in the two parter ""Rise of the Cybermen"" and ""The Age of Steel"". The Doctor, Mickey and Rose end up in an alternate reality where Rose discovers her father is still alive. If you remember the heart breaking episode from the first season where Rose tries to save her father, then this two-parter in an alternate universe is likely to have you reaching for an abundant supply of Kleenex.

David Tennant was for me the Doctor who said ""It's okay to love me. I don't mind!"". His impervious charms and his quick wit would serve this series well. I give this series five stars because honestly, for this price, you're getting your lovely allowance of vitamin D.",1397520000,4,1869,4.723926380368098
6228912,5,B00HVBB16I,"So, in the interest of helping with the decision of whether to purchase this or not, I thought I'd inform everyone what is in this set.  This set is two discs, and included the first have of season 2 of Doctor Who, including the Christmas special.  You get half the season, and 1 new special feature.  What you don't get is all the plethora of special features that are included in the full set.  This is why the set is only 2 discs, as they are pretty much just filled with the episodes.  Whether you have any interest in the special feature or not really depends on your taste.  If you've been wanting to add the show to your collection for awhile, but didn't want to spend the high price of the full season sets, this is a great option.  I'd recommend it to people who are looking for an inexpensive alternative to the full sets, and who don't have much interest in the special features.",1397433600,72,890,4.325301204819277
6228913,2,B00HVBB16I,"I was really excited when I first heard this set was coming out and included all new bonus material.  I was hoping the bonus material was going to be the ""Tardisodes"" (a set of mini-episodes that served as a prequel to each episode in Series 2).  Fat chance.  The ""all new bonus material""  is a 24-minute ""The Making of 'Doctor Who Series 2, Part 1'"", and it's the ONLY bonus material that's included in this set.  So this set has NONE of the bonus material that accompanied the original Series 2 dvd release.  No episode commentaries, no deleted scenes, no Doctor Who Confidential, and no ""Doctor Who: Children in Need"" special (a 7-minute mini-episode which showed what happened immediately after the Doctor regenerated from Eccleston to Tennant before the Tardis crashed down to Earth at the beginning of ""The Christmas Invasion"").  I think there may have been some other bonus material included in the original Series 2 set that's not included in this set, but I don't remember for certain.

I didn't watch ""The Making of 'Doctor Who Series 2, Part 1'"", but I'm guessing that it's just a rehash of some of the Confidential footage.  I could be completely wrong about that, but in any case, I can't imagine that there's enough new material in this bonus feature to make it worth picking up this set when you can get all the bonus material from The Complete Second Series for just a few dollars more (currently The Complete Second Series is $27.49 at Amazon while Series 2: Parts 1 & 2 will probably run you about $23 when Part 2 comes out)

In short, if you care anything about bonus material, you should pass on this set.

Disclaimer: I do not own ""Doctor Who: Series Two, Part One"" or ""Doctor Who: The Complete Second Series.""  A friend of mine bought Series Two, Part One so I checked out his copy, and I watched the Complete Second Series on DVD from Netflix.",1397433600,22,1866,4.587349397590361
6228914,5,B00HVBB16I,"Hi all whovians, this review comes from not a hardcore fan,but a casual one who recently got into the 2005 series and am wondering how these sets differ from the main series sets as far as porting all main features over,i really want to find out if series 1 with Chris Ecclestion will have part sets as i will consider buying anyway.",1393286400,,333,4.387096774193548
6228915,5,B00HVBB16I,Dr. Who is the best.  David Tennant as the Dr. is the best.  Not only did this vendor provide an excellent copy of Dr. Who but the experience of having Dr. Who available whenever is unparalleled.  I only dream that generations of people can be witness to this masterpiece of telecommunications.  Our Special Relationship is all the more special since owning this.,1480464000,2,363,4.806451612903226

6228928,4,B00HVBB16I,"All of Series 2 is good Doctor Who, especially ""Blink"" (in Part Two) so I give Part One 4 stars.  However, I originally bought the entire series 3, as well as the entire series 2 eight or ten years ago and while watching them again I discovered that almost all of the disks had become unplayable through degeneration or corruption.  I've got DVDs I've had twenty years, even ones I've used for recording and not had a similar problem.  It made me wonder if it was worth buying Doctor Who disks, especially with the prices of new episodes.  To date, I've had no problem with the parts 1 and 2 of series 2 and 3 which I purchased, but I've only had them a few months.",1444003200,4,665,4.253968253968254

6228937,5,B00HVBB16I,"So fans of Doctor Who are gonna want to double dip on these Series 2-4 Volume releases because they feature new remastered NTSC transfers! As you may or may not know, the Series 1-4 box set releases features the show in it's original PAL format, but more specifically they're PAL-NTSC transfers meaning a ghosting effect throughout (as the norm when most PAL material appears on NTSC systems and not fully converted to the latter) and that could be annoying to some. But the new volume releases are again, new NTSC transfers, no ghosting detected! Now, when PAL material is converted to NTSC, the sound pitch is unfortunately lower/deeper than it's original sound pitch if not corrected properly (compare an NTSC DVD with a PAL DVD and you'll know the difference in the sound), but don't panic! The good news is that BBC has also corrected the sound pitch to match its original PAL counterpart and it's not the first time either, they did the same with the Series 5-8 sets, Day of The Doctor, Time Of Doctor, Deep Breath DVD/Blu-rays as well as The Spearhead From Space Blu (another studio to do this practice was Synapse when they released Hammer House of Horror and I think all studios, when converting PAL material to NTSC, should always follow this example). Each of the volume releases also include a new featurette called Doctor Who: A New Dimension focusing on the making of episodes appearing on the respected releases. So yes, it's worth the double dip especially if you already have the season sets.",1421366400,5,1509,4.78544061302682

6228941,5,B00HVBB16I,"While I was a bit sad to see Eccleston leave I think Tennant does an absolutely fantastic job.

Buying the seasons in 2 parts like this is a sound choice. Not only does this come out cheaper ($30 rather than $40-$50), but it's also jam packed with bonus features. If you have any doubts on which way to but this series (parts vs full season) you can put your mind to rest. This is the way to buy it.",1406505600,,399,4.050632911392405

This is where the world started to absolutely fall for David Tennant. Tennant stars as the Doctor after the previous star (Christopher Eccleston) decided to bow out. With this neew regeneration, we get to learn to love the Doctor all over again.",1521590400,,520,4.725274725274725
