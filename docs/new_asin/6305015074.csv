This is the most complete and accurate review of this VHS you will find. I hope you find this review helpful; remember to vote helpful or not helpful. (Note-Each VHS I review has a ""Match of the VHS"" award somewhere in it.)

WWF Mayhem in Manchester
I hate this videotape so much. It looked so great after reading the back. This is just a 60-minute highlight video of an event in Manchester. There are only two matches on this entire tape that aren't clipped. This event took place only days after Wrestlemania XIV.

Jeff Jarrett VS Brakus
You only see a few seconds of this one. Brakus uses his power, but Jarrett gets the advantage with a Figure Four.
RATING- No Rating

County Whippin' Match
D.O.A. VS The Godwinns
You see a bit more of this match, but it is still only about a minute or two. The Godwinns do some double team moves. There is a heavy amount of strap use.
RATING- No Rating

Bradshaw VS Marc Mero w/ Sable
Another match that you see only a few seconds of. Bradshaw wins with a Lariat.
RATING- No Rating

Ken Shamrock & Owen Hart VS The Rock & D'Lo Brown
You see a good bit of this match, but yet again it is plagued with being clipped up. D'Lo Brown wrestles for his side for the majority of the match.
RATING- No Rating

Cactus Jack VS Goldust w/ Luna
I was actually really excited to see this match. The match is again clipped. Jack doesn't use any of his usual hardcore antics in the match. The aftermath is nice though.
RATING- No Rating

WWF Tag Team Championships
New Age Outlaws(c) VS L.O.D. 2000
OH YOU DIDN'T KNOW? This match is also clipped. The Outlaws stay out of the match as much as possible and it gets really boring.
RATING- No Rating

WWF Championship
Stone Cold Steve Austin(c) VS Triple H w/Chyna
Notice in the entrances, it says Triple HHH on the nameplate. Horrible typo there. This is the first unclipped match of the tape. It is an awesome encounter too. It's sad that it is on this horrible videotape. Triple H focuses on Austin's leg most of the match. Good ending.
RATING- 8/10

Undertaker VS Kane w/ Paul Bearer
Undertaker is jumped by D-X on his way to the ring. From there he gets beat up a little by Kane. In a minute or so, he regains he composure and hits a chokeslam. Kane sits up. Undertaker then hits a Tombstone Piledriver. It's over. This is the second unclipped match, but it is bad and very short.

7880612,3,6305015074,"This event may have been a lot better if WWF Home Video actually showed more than one hour.  Considering the fact that there were eight matches on one card, there could have been a lot more to this video.  The event took  place just days after Wrestlemania 14.  The new WWF Champion-Stone Cold  Steve Austin makes his first televised title defense against Challenger and  WWF European Champion-HHH.  The Undertaker takes on Kane in a rematch from  WM14.  The WWF Tag Team Champions-New Age Outlaws vs. Challengers-L.O.D.  2000.  Cactus Jack vs. The Artist Formerly Knows As Goldust.  Ken Shamrock  and Owen Hart vs. WWF Intercontinental Champion-The Rock and D-Lo Brown of  the Nation of Domination.  Bradshaw takes on Marvelous Marc Mero.  In a  Country Whippin' Match, the D.O.A. take on the Godwinns.  Plus, Jeff  Jarrett goes one on one with Brakus.",938563200,5,853,4.964285714285714
7880613,2,6305015074,I was in the store today looking for a video to buy for 12 dollars.  Because it was all I had so I pick this video up.  A very disappointing tape for one Michael Cole and Kevin Kelly get the hell out of here.  The  only good match was Austin vs HHH and that was the only reason.  Why I  bought it don't waste your money.  Letdown matches edited for example the  Rock was about to talk and they edit it.  One reason to buy it HHH vs  Austin nothing more.  If you know someone who has this tape just record  that match.,933379200,,517,3.912621359223301
