I love this show and always have since i was a little kid and watched it on TV during its original run.  The ""Freaky Favorites"" DVD is kind of unnecessary though because the 6 epesodes appear on season 6 and 7, which are the ones with the new actors.  If you are going to buy the rest of the seasons, you don't really need that one, but this is still a great buy.",1270598400,,464,4.010869565217392

I watched every show when I was a child...Which Is why I think I turned out the way I did...lol After I bought the 3 DVD's, I put on a marathon with my friends and I, and we had an ABSOULT blast reliving all of those great childhood memories...as sick and twisted as they were. Ever since I've bought these, I've been trying to get the word out about them, They are too great not to have in your collection!!!!!",1180483200,,476,4.129032258064516
