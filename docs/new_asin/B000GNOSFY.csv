2615502,2,B000GNOSFY,"I am all for erotica by and for women, but surely we can do better than this? The production values are painfully low, the plots and dialog are bare-bones, and the actors are stilted and unattractive. It's just like porn for men, only the camera never strays below the waistline.

I was particularly interested in the story about the woman who seduces her blind piano tuner. He was actually pretty good looking, but terrible at playing blind, not convincing at all. The woman was older and not attractive. I believe older women can be sexy on film, but at least give her something better to wear than foundational undergarments. It was a good premise, mildly entertaining, but overall not very well executed.",1247529600,5,708,4.80327868852459
2615503,5,B000GNOSFY,"I enjoy the Bliss series DVD's and can't wait for the 3rd! It's all very softcore, but very interesting, erotic and eye-opening. A large glass of wine and an episode of Bliss always put's me in the mood! :)",1194912000,2,206,4.3076923076923075

8133590,5,B000GNOSFY,"when I was younger. I remembered seeing this on the oxygen network and wondered what this show was about. When I watched more and more, I became a fan of it until the show was pulled a couple years later.",1356998400,,204,4.125
8133591,4,B000GNOSFY,"This was a good watch but not fully my tasts.  I'm not fond of stories where some one is cheating on another person, it kind of deflates me but the stories were very good and was definatly erotic.  If you don't mind those types of stories then I would say this is a great buy, if that's not really your thing I would say find something a little more like Hotel Erotica.",1301875200,2,369,4.111111111111111
8133592,1,B000GNOSFY,"1ST season very good ,, 2nd season DVD's were marked Promotional use only and this was on ALL episodes and appears on the screen all through the season .. YES I can return BUT shipping is as much as the DVD .. stories are real good but Quality so poor , like copy off internet ,, would not recommend very poor quality",1292630400,2,317,4.129032258064516
8133593,1,B000GNOSFY,"Every episode had a bright warning sign popping up over and over and over: ""For Promotional Use Only."" ""For Promotional Use Only."" ""Etc."" So why did they sell it to me for $9.98 on 5 May 2010? Didn't care much for any of the episodes either. Not bad, just ok.",1278028800,,259,4.2
8133594,5,B000GNOSFY,"The eight episodes contained on this DVD go hand in with those in Seasons 1 and 3. I enjoyed ""The Marvellon,"" ""Office Management,""  ""Aural Sex"" and ""The Piano Tuner"" as well as the other four episodes. I enjoyed them so much that I'm taking the effort to provide the necessary information to update the IMDb database. It'll take some time for me, but I believe in making sure things I read are right!",1264809600,,400,4.47945205479452
8133595,4,B000GNOSFY,"Apparently we missed Bliss when it was on TV.  While it isn't quite as good as Red Shoes Diaries, it is still fun and entertaining to watch.  It explores about every area of sexuality, but does it without full-frontal nudity.  It's tasteful and erotic.  Romantic and exciting.  The series was produced by two women who did a fine job of creating stories that are sexy without being offensive.  We're getting the other two seasons that are available.  Wish there were more of this kind of DVD's available.",1252886400,6,504,4.724137931034483
