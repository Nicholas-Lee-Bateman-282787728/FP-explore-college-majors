7911934,1,B00000JDIZ,Too slow. I was waiting for something more interesting. I don't want to be unfair and I  confess I saw for 20 minutes,1477958400,,117,4.086956521739131
7911935,1,B00000JDIZ,"Not much here to recommend since there isn't much that this oddity is about!
What soul searching there is lackluster and the acting is even starnger! Some performances are good, but most are wooden and the script is full of how people actually never talk to each other in real life. Terrible.",1245456000,,292,4.634615384615385
7911936,3,B00000JDIZ,"Somewhat hilariouslly amusing gay-comedy of dysfunctional families and friend's, loose moral's and plenty of partner-swapping bed-hopping hi-jinx set amongst Boston's Art community of gallery opening's, hammy-theater performing numerous drug & drink cocktail-partie's and you've got a movie called NEVER MET PICASSO.
Plot is thin and shallow and never really goe's anywhere as character's drop in and out of scenes from nowhere and do nothing.
However Andy(Alexis Arquette) is a frustrated(in more way's than one)30 yr-old gay painter whom enter's a contest to win a trip to Africa for much needed inspiration.
His self-centered mother actress Genna Magnus(Margot Kidder) is vexed by her directionless son and is preoccupied with the world's worst play Naked Tenor(so awful it's funny).
Andy's Uncle(Alvin Epstein) is also gay and keeper of a family-secret.
Other numerous notable friend's are Lesbian childhood-pal Lucy(Georgia Ragsdale) whom shine's the brightest.
All in all fine performances by all cast in a much needed tighter written script by 1st timer director Stephen Kijak, but passable.
Pace drag's along slowly and could've benefitted with some forward-momentom. Amusing.",959558400,7,1184,5.771428571428571
