2793996,4,B000OCZ9WS,"This is one I will definitely be adding to my horror collection. There have been alot of killer-croc movies and most have been pretty poor, but I found this one to be exciting, fun, and surprisingly well shot. Throw in the fact that it is based on a true story and it all adds up to a nice surprise in what has been a dreary year for horror movies. I'm not sure of the box-office totals, but I don't think it fared very well, and obviously by reading alot of the other reviews most of you didn't care for it, and that's a shame. Let me ask you all when was the last time you saw a good creature feature? It's been a long time, so for those who have not seen it, give it a chance, I'm glad I did.

I see a few people are complaining about the acting, and granted, it's not top-notch, but then again.....it's a creature feature remember? Who cares about the acting? The real star is the croc, and it's quite a sight to behold. I usually don't give props to CG unless it's done real well and believable and it succeeds here. Never through the entire movie did it look fake, grainy or mis-matched, and by that I mean the backgrounds stayed the same as did the colors. Some of the croc killing scenes are real intense and gory which just added to the terror of how monstrous and horrible this thing was. The natives have taken to calling him Gustave and apparently Gustave has killed almost 300 people in real life, that alone is pretty unsettling. I must insist everyone watch the special feature ""Crokumentary: The making of Gustave"" I appreciate the time and labor the crew when into making Gustave look as real as possible and the attention to detail and perfection the director was aiming for.

Dominic Purcell and Orlando Jones are both decent, Orlando is able to crack some funny one-liners and actually show he has a little range as an actor. The female lead (Brooke Langton) is rather bland but easy on the eyes, and Jurgen Procknow is credible as usual until he dies, cuz' let's face it, every movie he does, he dies in..... The scenery is wonderfull and the war between the two African factions is scary and sad and adds a crual conflict to the back-drop of the search for Gustave. The ending also surprised me, it was well done and exciting, didn't feel rushed and nice to see the not-so-happy ending for once. The African swamp is a creepy place and the movie is eager to show all just how creepy it can get.

The movie is not perfect by any means, and instead of listing it's short-comings I'm going to just say again how much fun I had watching it. It was a pleasant surprise and helps me to believe in monster movies again, as I have been a fan of them my whole life. One of my favorite early 80's horror movies was Alligator, and this had the same feeling and vibe as that movie. The special effects are solid, the acting decent, and Gustave was just awesome I tell you, awesome. Gustave apparently still lives and hunts along that same river, maybe we can get a sequel down the  road, could be fun, here's hoping...........",1182038400,,3036,4.377659574468085
2793997,3,B000OCZ9WS,"The other day I watched part of ""Lake Placid II"" on the Sci-Fi network and it was really bad. Well, probably much worse than that.  Actually it was unwatchable.
The killer croc storyline's been done many times but only once or twice decently.  If you know anything about croc movies than you realize I'm referring to the fabulous ""Alligator"" and the above average ""Lake Placid"".
Part of the problem with Primevil is that there's too much going on, diverges in too many directions, and often leaves viewers somewhat lost. The film takes itself rather seriously and suffers from  a lack of consistent tone,  humour, & focus.  On the upside the violence when it presents itself is often extremely brutal and unrelentling & the CGI, above average in most scenes, manages to convey the ""monster"" to good effect. I still wasn't able to discern if this was a monster flick, a war thriller, or a statement film proselytizing on the politics of Africa?  It's a little hard to follow frankly but I guess that's not of huge importance since I found myself shamelessly enjoying the film. Remember the movie Anaconda?  Well if you're reading this review then of course you do.  At any rate  I pretty much hated that film but found this to be interesting & kind of weird where Anaconda was just derivative & cheesy.  For fans of  ""Jaws"", Primevil ain't a bad popcorn event.  For fans of ""Tentacles"" (yes, with Shelley Winters) this will be an almost memorable way to spend two hours.",1181952000,,1469,4.7176470588235295
2793998,3,B000OCZ9WS,"The promo ads for this film tried to suggest that this feature is about a serial killer, but no, it is about a monstrous fresh water crocodile, a giant one that is the scourge of Burundi, who preys upon the villagers along the Rizizi river. The natives have dubbed him GUSTAVE.
GUSTAVE is for real. He is a 23 ft. long, believed to weigh over a ton and believed to have devoured 300 people. The film can say that "" it was inspired by true events"" because the Giant Croc is still believed to have been sighted very recently. There is a National Geographic documentary about Gustave. Wounds made by bullets/arrows/machetes make Gustave easily identified.

In the movie, Tim Manfrey(Dominic Purcell, Prison Break) accompanied by a news reporter named Aviva( hottie Brooke Langton, The Replacements), Steven(Orlando Jones) and conservationist Matthew(Gideon Emery) is sent to Burundi to try to capture and make a documentary about the capture of the legendary croc.
Burundi is in the midst of a civil war when the team arrives, with much of the nation cowering in fear of a warlord nicknamed Little Gustave. ""He got his name from the crocodile. It's hard to say whose blood is colder,"" says a town official.

The team aided by a local tracker, begins the hunt for Gustave while hoping not to run into the rebel militias. They encounter both the human Gustave and the reptilian version. That's where the film gets to reflect: Who is more murderous, The man or the Crocodile?

The director M. Katleman stated that JAWS inspired him while making this film, and it shows. It never gets close to that level of suspense, but PRIMEVAL is definitely a lot better than all the JAWS sequels/knock-offs. There are some immersive, tense moments notwithstanding. The characters are flat and the script is wooden(except for Orlando Jones' quips). The CGI EFX is very well done, especially the water effects. I didn't see any artifacts at all. Realism really went to the back burner here, specifically with the chase scene in the field. Crocodiles are ambush predators, not rampaging agile berserkers. I'm not sure really how a 23 ft. croc would move, but I'm pretty sure the law of ""short bursts of speed"" applies to Gustave as with any other crocs. They are also cold-blooded reptiles, so in the movie, Gustave should be seen basking in the sun more often and not hidden.

PICTURE: Anamorphic Widescreen 2.40 ratio. The transfer is very decent. Colors are very vivid and the edges are a bit grainy but extremely sharp. Some night scenes could have used more detail(in the Black level area) but it does add a moody look. Overall, very nice.
Sound: 5.1 Dolby digital is very good. Quite solid with a lot of deep bass.
EXTRAS:
Commentary by the director and the visual effects supervisor. (I think he did GHOST RIDER's effects also).
""Crocumentary: Bringing Gustave to Life"" (9:38) is quite informative with regard to creating the computer-generated Gustave. I was very amazed in the tricks of the trade.
Three Deleted scenes(5+ minutes) I didn't care much for the commentaries that went along with them.

Overall, GUSTAVE is a very watchable movie. It is a lot better than all the creature features in the SCI-FI channel/JAWS wannabes/sequels  and is quite entertaining. Watch it with an open mind, don't expect much, just sit on your favorite chair and grab your popcorn. Enjoy it for what it is, a good evening diversion from a hard day's work. 3 stars!",1181779200,2,3436,4.844974446337308
2793999,2,B000OCZ9WS,"PRIMEVAL is not your typical giant crocodile movie...it doesn't know whether it wants to be a horror movie or a study of civil war and unrest in Africa.  But either way, it's a misfire.  The script is contrived and a little tedious; the special effects are okay, but there's not enough of the crocodile.  The direction is reminiscent of early MTV and a copy of such films as HOSTEL and SAW.  Much of the action is filmed in the dark and it's difficult to see what's going on.  The acting from Dominic Purcell and Orlando Jones disappointing; only veteran Jurgen Prochnow manages to give a solid supporting performance.  Horror fans will probably be disappointed.",1181779200,2,662,4.7631578947368425
2794000,2,B000OCZ9WS,"Strangely enough, I probably picked the lesser of 2 evils to rent since Primeval was released on DVD the same day as Ghost Rider, the critically-and-fan-panned comic book film. I knew that one would be terrible but there was always that slight glimmer of hope with this one. Slither didn't look terribly interesting but I found it quite...fun, so could Primeval do the same thing? The answer is a huge no as there is so many problems with this one it's hard to tell where to start.

A TV news station sends Tim, Steven and budding reporter Aviva to Burundi, Africa to investigate ""Gustave"", a killer known for being vicious and more than 300 kills. Thing is, Gustave is a huge crocodile so capturing it is of course the main thing. But that's not all they have to tend with as there is a civil war in the country happening and a warlord so bad they nickname him ""Little Gustave"". Will the team make it out alive or will they shot or even munched?

Of course the main attraction with the movie is to see people getting bitten and thrased around and you'll get this in spades. The problem? It's hard to see. While there is some night attacks, the crocodile just looks badly animated that it looks like a big blurry glob when it gets more quicker. This is basically a B-movie or even a C so if you want to see well-developed characters, look elsewhere. The one character that audiences will grow to like and tries to get out of their one-note persona doesn't even last through the movie. Oops. The only cool people are Dominic Purcell of Prison Break who plays that kind of cool anti-hero role and Brooke Langdon who really just looks hot.

But ultimately the main problem with the film is that it just feels so dull. It's one of those kind of films where tension almost seems cut down by useless scenes or attacks that don't feel as exciting. Think back to Jaws or Alien(s) where you felt at every turn something can happen which made you on edge. Here you feel like ""just bring back the blurry crocodile already"". The civil war sidestory isn't terribly interesting either and it feels like a really lackluster way to inject some human drama in the film. There's even a epiphany by one of the characters to hammer in the message. Bah.

Should you rent it? No. Buy it? Definately not. But if you can't seem to find anything else, still look some more and if nothing's there still, just read a book.",1181606400,2,2395,4.473684210526316
2794001,2,B000OCZ9WS,"Phew, while this film was action-packed, surprising, and terrifying, when one is able to see what was happening, I will also state I agree with these other reviewers in saying the premise of this film was contrived and deceiving.  Having seen the trailer numerous times on my home television with the exact phrase ""serial killer in Africa"" flashing each and every time, I was immediately sold on the idea being a horror fan and all that.  Instead, with this film, we are treated, no insulted, to a remake of some kind of 1999's Lake Placid and not even a decent one.  Lake Placid, in case you reading this haven't watched it, was funny, terrifying and memorable whereas this film, Primeval, well, I can't even remember one single phrase spoken in the film. Anyways, I don't wish to spend all night blasting this movie, no matter how much it deserves to.  It just seems like more and more movies are being produced, filmed, and then relased direct-to-video with only a handful select films being released to theaters and even then it's a stretch to really catch a good film every now.  True film is fast becoming a dying art and if seem doubtful, just look at what's being released in theaters this summer...Shrek the Third, Spider-Man 3, Pirates of the Caribbean 3.  Hollywood, without a doubt, has flushed the concept of originality down the porcelain master so instead of spending our hard-earned cash on decent, unique, innovative films, we are throwing it out the window on junk.  What's worse is when life becomes so dull, you find yourself wanting to see the same peice of crap twice in theaters.  Now the original Pirates of the Caribbean, which was decent just for the record, I ended up watching 5 times in theaters and I'm sure someone out there has my record beaten by more than half.  ( By the way, I have all my ticket stubs to prove MY claim).

 Getting back to Primeval.....Look, if you want a realistic, up-to date, NON-FICTIONAL story about serial killers in Africa, watch Blood Diamond, with Leo Dicaprio and the always luminous Jen Connelly.  The film, which has received 5 academy awards nominations, was filmed on location, and is in my opinion, gruesome, riveting, compelling and provocative.  Really, I haven't purchased a single diamond since the film's domestic theatrical release.

 One more thing, I'm just wondering who the creature effects wizard was?  Stan Winston, who is most famous for his original Zenomorph (ALIEN, 1979) and the creature from SPECIES (the human form being portrayed by the sight for sore eyes Canadian-born Natasha Henstridge) and also the crocodile from Lake Placid, sure as Hell didn't waste time with this film. His designs tend to rely mainly on animatronics and costumes with dependance on computer-generation being secondary ( 1999's End of Days being the exception to that statement).  In conclusion, the bottom line is not to hold any expectancy for originality any more.  As someone very cynical (not me) said...""If you expect nothing, you won't be disappointed""",1181001600,,3023,4.905697445972495
2794002,2,B000OCZ9WS,"""Primeval"" tricked me. I knew nothing about the film other than a brief blurb I'd read that said it was about a serial killer and was based on a true story. Turns out the ""serial killer"" is, in fact, a large, hundred-year old crocodile named Gustave. Ho ho!

Eh.

The story is about a news team that has been sent to Africa in order to cover a story on (and perhaps capture) the elusive beast. The movie briefly explains why a blood-thirsty crocodile is news (and even why it would be left up to journalists, a cameraman, and two wild animal experts to catch a critter that's been eating unsuspecting humans for decades), but the explanation is weak, at best.

Even weaker is the awkward melding of the croc plot with another story thread involving an African civil war that is propogated and prolonged by a blood-thirsty warlord named -- that's right -- Gustave. Is this a powerful political metaphor? Probably. Is it done well? Of course it isn't.

Populated by stock characters of the worst kind (although Orlando Jones manages to do some good things with his smart-aleck cameraman role), ""Primeval"" succumbs to ludicrousness (the characters, after a recent croc attack, decide that a rickety shack built IN the river is their best safe haven), pointlessness (the dull bonfire ""bonding"" scene where a tribal drum session is followed by the Westerners singing ""Amazing Grace"" off-key), and confusion (most of the croc attacks take place at night and are dizzyingly hard to follow). Tack on a hokey (albeit unfortunately true) message about American apathy toward African brutality, and you're left with a jury-rigged mess of a movie, a schizophrenic cinematic experience that tries to be viscerally scintillating as well as politically charged. If it had picked one or the other, it may have had at least a shred of consistency to give it pluck and cohesion. Instead, it's a mawkish blend of macabre and moralistic.

And it's not about a serial killer.",1176076800,28,1954,4.873493975903615

2794048,2,B000OCZ9WS,"A failed attempt to blend politics and horror, war and a creature feature.  The plot deals with a civil war in Africa and a small group of journalists, a guide/hunter, and a herpetologist who travel there to kill (or capture) an immense crocodile named Gustave.  With split concerns, neither plot gets its full due.  The film wavers clumsily between the two until you don't know which monster is the star of the feature (we make our own monsters.).  They needed to pick an issue and stick with it.  Instead, the viewer is expected to wait a long time until the crocodile finally goes on the rampage.
The film was not well received, especially by naturalists and herpetologists.  Above all else, it was an insult to Burundi, showing the country in a bad light.  As though all the people were savages, barbarians, thieves, and murderers.  Whatever its objective, the filmmakers missed the mark.",1477094400,,892,4.822368421052632

The visuals are pretty good, the acting (aside from Orlando Jones playing the same person he always plays) fairly talented, and the plot surprisingly sensible. The graphics used for Gustave are pretty detailed, nothing low-grade here. Though the scenes where he's running like an Olympic sprinter really pull you out of the film, so yeah.

2794163,2,B000OCZ9WS,"PRIMEVAL is a movie about a giant man-eating crocodile stalking the people who live along an African river who also cleverly eludes the journalists and scientists trying to capture him.  A movie with that basic description is not going to be credible or even particularly good.  And it is not good...make no mistake.  But amazingly, it is far more ambitious that I would ever have suspected it might be, with many m ore positives that I might have expected.

One of the biggest plusses is the setting (or scenery).  Set in modern day Africa, in the country of Burundi...it is expansively filmed and truly showcases the harsh yet starkly beautiful landscapes.  I'm not sure where the movie was filmed and whether the topography bears any relation to Burundi...but it was very nice to look at.  The cinematographer has processed his work in such a way that the colors are super-saturated (which helps give the landscapes a rich look too).  The brown tones of the stark landscape really pop out in a gripping way that makes the air seem hot.  I expected the movie to have a cursory, uninspired look, but it was really a high point.

Plot-wise, the movie is ambitious as well.  We have American journalists coming to the country in the hopes of capturing on film the infamous Gustav, a giant croc that has killed hundreds of natives.  Gustav is suddenly world renowned because he killed a white forensic scientist.  Racial tensions are a key theme of the whole movie...as is the fact that this is a war-torn country (similar to the more infamous Rwanda or Darfur), and the vicious warlords rule things outside of the city and away from the prying eyes of civilization.  The journalists and the hunter they hire are not only endangered by the croc, but by the very socio-political milieu they have been dropped in.  The film takes some obvious shots at the way the west ignored the troubles in Africa...but who expected a movie about a killer reptile to make any political points, however unsubtle?  In fact, many of the more effective scenes feature the frightening warlords and no crocodile.

For a slasher-type film...and that's what this is, only substituting a crocodile for Michael Myers...the cast is slightly better than usual.  Rather than a bunch of generic attractive teenagers, we've got known faces such as PRISON BREAK star Dominic Purcell, comic actor Orlando Jones and even DAS BOOT star Jurgen Prochnow.  This is not to say that the script gives them much to do or that they provide Oscar-winning performances...but it's nice to see people who aren't 30 year-olds pretending to be teens.  The performances, all cardboard characters, are solid but thoroughly unexceptional.

So this all sounds pretty decent right?  Decent acting, nice cinematography, more brains than usual and a man-eating croc on the rampage.  What could be better?  Well, sad to say, the movie is boring.  Despite all the elements thrown in to spice things up...the set up to the action seems to take forever, and involves a lot of utterly trite dialogue.  Once the croc begins to become a real presence in the film, most of his appearances are devoid of tension.  And the effects that render the beast are pretty sub-par.  So you've got a movie where everyone is playing it quite straight and serious...but action sequences that are cheesy enough to fit right in to PIRANHAS.  But mostly the film just drags and drags.  In the final 10 minutes or so, the action finally kicks into high gear...but by then we are well past caring in the least.  It's a 90 minute movie that feels like a full 2 hour slog.  A film like this, even with serious overtones, demands to be brisk, fast-paced and action-focused.  Instead, it is turgid.

So, I was sure this would be a one-star debacle.  Instead, it is a 2 star waste of time.  Better than expected, but still not worth anyone's time.",1312416000,2,3857,4.790909090909091
2794164,5,B000OCZ9WS,"Like a lot of people, when I first saw the previews for this movie I was expecting a horror film about a killer Crocodile. The croc ended up almost being a sub-plot amidst the civil war torn area in which it hunts. I think this is why so many people were disappointed with it and for this, as always, I blame Hollywood producers who don't have enough faith in their product to market it as is. This is what happens when studios are run by people who went to business school instead of film school.
The film follows a news crew trying to document the capture of this unusually large (though exaggerated compared to the actual croc it is based on) crocodile in the area of Burundi which is suffering from a civil war which happens to be as much a part of the story as the croc hunt. This is loosely based on the PBS documentary 'Capturing the Killer Croc.' I'm not a big critic of acting talent. I've always taken the view that as long as the acting is not so horrible as to make the movie unwatchable then I'm happy. That said I had no problem with any of the performances in this film. The story kept me hooked and the special effects were pretty awesome. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good film that goes beyond just being a gore fest, though there is plenty of gore to be had here.",1303776000,,1313,4.256
2794165,3,B000OCZ9WS,"Monster of the week movies have become something of a Syfy staple.  I've seen so many that I can write the script with my eyes closed: human with grudge tracks monster, monster shows human-like intelligence, cutting-edge technology is used to capture the beast, a person is dragged screaming off-camera, interference from petty humans prevents the beast from being caught, and sometimes if the director's feeling generous the human bad guy gets eaten by the monster.  So it's surprising when a monster movie gets a mainstream release.

Perhaps that's why Primeval is so insecure about being a monster movie.  Instead, its trailers try to place Primeval in the slasher genre, claiming that the killer has eaten over 300 victims and he ""might not even be human.""  That's the only bit of truth to be found in the trailer.  The killer isn't human at all --  he's Gustave, a 60-year-old, 20 foot long, 1-ton crocodile.  The plot is taken from the 2004 documentary Capturing the Killer Croc, which features a naturalist who, along with a documentary team, took on the monster.  Patrice Faye, a Burundi naturalist, sought to capture Gustave in revenge for his colleague who was supposedly eaten by the beast. Sometimes these movies write themselves.

Primeval has Jacob Krieg (Jurgen Prochnow) filling in for Faye and instead of a colleague it's his wife that was eaten by the croc. Just as in real life a film crew is assembled to capture the beast, and Gustave's name is in fact namef after Burundi's then president, the ruthless former army major Pierre Buyoya (a Tutsi).  The camera crew, led by Tim Manfrey (Dominic Purcell), love interest Aviva Masters (Brooke Langton), and stereotypical comedic relief Steven Johnson (Orlando Jones), play up the fish-out-of-water element of their foolish venture to the hilt.  It quickly grates.

But back to that plot. Of course our heroes have a peculiar tracking device that pings.  The pinging gimmick debuted in Aliens and has been oft-repeated - here it brings shades of the ticking crocodile that swallowed Captain Hook's hand from Peter Pan. Eventually the two plots converge - Little Gustave and Big Gustave - into one unlikely denouement.  Unfortunately Primeval takes its time to get there.

What's surprising about Primeval is how little of the monster is in the monster movie.  This is as much a rant against American-imperialism, with its high-minded ideals that fell far short of stopping the Rwandan genocide, as it is about a killer crocodile.  And that's the secret Primeval was trying to conceal all along with its deceptive trailers: the Primeval title is about the cruelty of man against man.",1297728000,,2648,5.020594965675057

There have been many killer croc and alligator films out there and this is one of the few to have a theatrical release. It is also entertaining enough and enjoyable enough that I would say own it, I do and the DVD is great. Of course like any film like this it is only for certain people, people who like the monster flicks and nature amuck flicks. So how does this film stand up against others like it, pretty good I would say but not the best you can choose from.

A group of reporters and such are sent to Africa in search of a legendary crocodile and capture it, sounds like a job I would skip. But any way this crew is sent over and they seem some what happy to do it although Orlando Jones's character changes his tune quickly. Any way they are in search of a croc nicknamed Gustave after the tyrant person that has claim over the land. So they gather a team including a boy who wants to go to America and head out. But not only must they battle the killer croc but there seems to be a militia that is after them as well.

The movie is an enjoyable one that has its moments and is over all pretty entertaining, of course a killer croc is in it so that helps. Writers John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris it seems knew what they were making and set off with every African stereotype they could. Sometimes it works and others it doesn't but at least director Michael Katleman keeps things moving quickly. I think he was able to accomplish this because he works mostly in TV, with shows like ""Bird of Prey"" and ""Tru Calling"" to name a few. So even with the flaws the movie moves at a quick enough pace that you will forget about it.

Dominic Purcell is our lead here and he does a good job as leading hero, as does Brooke Langton as our heroine. Jrgen Prochnow, Gideon Emery, and Gabriel Malema all do very well here and like the rest of the cast seem like they had fun making it. But it is Orlando Jones that steals the show here as the comic relief and is the most fun. There are many things to have fun with here but the main one is of course the croc. Like any good monster flick the croc is big, mean, and hungry, is there any other type.

This film is just like any other killer croc film, fun but something to turn the brain off on. There are better ones but there are worse ones out there believe me, I own them. So I do recommend this film but I would say make it a rental first, then if you like it buy it. I did buy it like I do any flick like this, I tend to buy and not rent [it has backfired many a time].

2794171,3,B000OCZ9WS,"A brutal civil war in impoverished Burundi.  A legendary, 25-foot croc named Gustave who has terrorized the local population for hundreds of years.  Okay, I get the metaphor, which is why I enjoyed PRIMEVAL, an uneven, often silly, gore fest that still kept my attention throughout its villain's ever-more preposterous feats of carnivorous bloodletting.  At the end ol' Gustave is wearing a car for a necklace, but I digress.

When a cable news crew is sent deep into East Africa to film (and even dare to capture) the legendary croc, they suddenly find themselves embroiled in Burundi's nasty civil conflict.  Thus PRIMEVAL embarks on its nonstop violence, with the conflict reaching the shores of Gustave's habitat--and Gustave joins the party.  The imagery is intentionally gritty, jerky, out of focus, with much of the action just off camera--all for that documentary ""feel"".  And Gustave himself, in all his CGI glory, can cover dry ground like a cruise missile.  Now that's evolution.

The cast is as unexceptional as it is forgettable; however I did recognize Orlando Jones (the former 7UP pitchman).  In true horror film form the protagonists endure multiple gun wounds, stabs, blows to the head and additional trauma, yet still pull off herculean feats of last-second bravery.  Again, it's silly, yet PRIMEVAL, with its metaphor depicting unspeakable brutality and inhumanity, does get its point across.  Now if we could just set up a foot race between Gustave and Usain Bolt. . .

But simply put, I wanted a monster crocodile movie and instead got another lesson in the terrible true-life tyranny of Africa. Sure, the big ole Croc does some decent damage, as well as some very good CGI effects, but the whole plot of ""Don't go to Africa, even if you're Black!"" weighed-down the movie for me. I bet though if they lightened up the plot to be more like say Anaconda (which I'm not a huge fan of) and just got to the ""direct-to-video-sequel"" point, this might be better viewing the next time around.

2794191,2,B000OCZ9WS,"Why they would choose the title sequence like Se7en, instead of something strikingly NEW that that title was then, appropriately indicates the shifting, erratic, hard to follow action scenes that follow.

  I'll ignore the plot because who wants that? We want croc action, which is all any characters are good for. The audience wants to be fed by the croc.

  1) Once again another movie where the menial amount of monster scenes served seek to be more complicated and sophisticated - the worse flaw of the remake of King Kong that brought credibility down to a new level - instead of seeing the wisdom of going back to simplicity and clarity where all power and tension is. And newness.

  2) As if that mistake isn't enough, all but one of Gustave's scenes are in the dark (of course), so you can see but 10% of all the beautifully rendered beast. At least in Kong you could always see the creatures - and every hair of Kong.

  3) Commit to that the third celluloid sin of ""the school of spaztic schizo eclectic editing"" and you have the thick flick hat trick.

  As with so many films, they try for the first half hour, with humour and some cleverness, then they slowly go to sleep - as if that's ok - so the movie gradually descends the even darker road of inevitability - using the tired old tricks, increasingly more, and becoming any other film but itself.
  How many times have you thought: hey this is surprisingly worth more than it isn't, only to be disappointed later?

  Isn't it a pity they didn't do the real story, and have the thing eating hundreds of people. Not just an attack, and then stop. To make it new, you have one, two three ....ten. In a row. And this was the film to do it. The first serial killer films of early 80's made a milstone, in having many killings in one film. Now nothing is new.

2794205,1,B000OCZ9WS,"Yet another film about ... well, it has so many elements I've seen before, it's really a whole lot of ""yet another films"" tied together into a mess.

Among other things, PRIMEVAL is about two White Big Game Hunters going after a crocodile that thousands of natives are too incompetent to hunt on their own.  Sort of like Val Kilmer in THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS.  And Jon Voight's White Big Game Hunter in ANACONDA.

PRIMEVAL is also about a giant underwater predator (like JAWS -- in fact, one of PRIMEVAL's characters mentions JAWS).  But I preferred THE GREAT ALLIGATOR (aka THE BIG ALLIGATOR RIVER), a 1980 Italian JAWS ripoff.  It was lots more fun than PRIMEVAL.

If this is a messy review, so is PRIMEVAL.  Its White Big Game Hunter teams up with another White Big Game Hunter (one who's more high-tech, less blood-thirsty), and three TV journalists (this is really their story), and some Good Peaceful Africans.  Together, they fight both the crocodile and the Evil Africans who follow an Evil Warlord.

And that's one of my biggest peeves.  One of the most annoying Hollywood cliches, one that appears in both dystopian sci-fi TV shows, and Third World adventure films.  Seems that the problem with all dysfunctional societies is that there's One Evil Person (warlord, dictator, whoever), and everyone else is good and wants a peaceful, fair democracy.  All it takes to save society is kill this One Evil Person, which the newcomer heroes do within 90 minutes, after millions of people living under the regime have been failing for years.

SPOILER:

In PRIMEVAL, this Evil Warlord has been terrorizing his nation for years.  But then he's stupid enough to enter the jungle with only ONE BODYGUARD, and allows the heroes to lure him to the crocodile, which then kills him.  Happy ending!

In reality, all people are brutalized in years-long civil wars.  Both sides have ""bad"" guys, and all ""bad"" guys are complex (not just entirely evil).  It's never as easy as ""kill this one man, and all will be well.""  Societal problems are structural, not rooted in one person.

Well, okay.  So PRIMEVAL isn't TRAFFIC or CRASH, or any of those intelligent films that examine the structural complexity of social problems.  But neither is it a fun horror film.  As others have said, it's a mess that tries to be everything, and succeeds at being nothing.

* THE GREAT ALLIGATOR (aka THE BIG ALLIGATOR RIVER) doesn't have PRIMEVAL's modern special effects, but it's a lot more ""horror fun.""

* SYRIANA and MARIA FULL OF GRACE and BEYOND BORDERS are better examinations of Third World social problems.

* THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS is a better film about White Big Game Hunters.

* THE KILLING FIELDS and THE YEAR OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY are better films about journalists in a Third World battle zone.

PRIMEVAL fails on every level.  Its characters are forgettable; its plot so cliched that we know where it's going.  I was fast-forwarding just to get it over with it.",1192838400,2,2960,4.8
2794206,3,B000OCZ9WS,"Well, I can't say that I didn't warn myself when I rented this movie. I knew what I was in for: another lame monster movie about some over-sized beast/creature in the wild. After seeing films such as Lake Placid, Anaconda, and just about any Sci-Fi original picture ever made (i.e. Frankenfish, Boa vs. well..whatever, etc.), I knew that this film wouldn't be a good one, and indeed, it wasn't. First off, the movie cheats by saying that its ""inspired"" by true events, just to lure you in. ""Inspired"" is just another way of saying that there was, and apparently still is, a man-eating croc in Burundi, Africa and that there was a Civil War going on there at the time. However, this particular story is fiction..which I wouldn't think I would even have to say that, since the overall plot is so VERY weak. Basically, an American news crew (which consists of ONLY 3 people) go with a Guide and an animal wrangler, to Burundi to catch the huge Croc in order to boost ratings for the network...uh..ok..whatever. Meanwhile, the underlying sub-plot is supposed to be the whole War going on at the time between the Hutu and the Tutsi while the big croc hunt is going on. In theory, this may have been a good idea, but someone forgot to tell the director that the film is still a monster movie!! There is way too much story about the whole war..infact, especially towards the final scenes in the film, its the Croc plot that seems to become only a vehicle to help tell the other story!! To prove my point, there was just as much killing, if not more, between characters as there was by the Croc itself!! Ridiculous! Another that kills me about not just this movie, but all these movies, is that they make the monster way too damn smart!! Yes, some animals can be real intelligent creatures, but as far as some big Croc running around chasing people for no reason..please! And apparently, the Croc also has impeccable timing as well (see the scene where a certain solider is trying to have his way with the American girl in the tent), to know when exactly to show up! As far as the acting, its not horrible, Orlando Jones brings some decent one-liners, but overall, nothing special at all. But believe it or not, I do have some semi- positive things to say about this film. Though the Croc was done totally with CGI, I really did think they did a pretty good job with it. It looks good in most shots. Also, there are a couple of good death scenes involving the beast...my personal favorite is the kid swimming for the doll in the water. However, those things don't save this movie from being at best, mediocre. This film is basically a small step up from the aforementioned Sci-Fi Originals that come on pretty much every Saturday afternoon. Let the buyer beware..this is pretty much a ""Croc"" of..well..you know.",1191628800,,2803,4.57455268389662

2794208,4,B000OCZ9WS,"You know, I didn't think this film was bad at all.  I think there's actually a lot more to the movie than some viewers expect, and so it is that some end up disappointed by the fact that death by crocodile doesn't stand at the center of every scene.  Frankly, I find it rather inane for some individuals to claim they were snookered by the film's billing as a story about ""the world's most prolific serial killer.""  Look at the DVD case, people - there's a great big crocodile on there.  I'm also not going to fault Primeval for daring to go beyond the comfort zone of a mere killer monster movie, especially when it's helping to highlight the growing tragedies of civil war and genocide taking place in Africa (under the morally bankrupt UN's uncaring noses).  One has to ask oneself exactly who the monster in this film really is - as far as I'm concerned, it's not the crocodile.

With so many reporters out there writing fake stories, I sort of like the idea of sending these corrupt conmen to deepest Africa in search of a nine-meter-long killer crocodile.  That's the fate that befalls Tim Manfrey (Dominic Purcell) when he fails to verify the facts on a major story he writes.  This crocodile, dubbed Gustave by the locals, has been killing villagers in Burundi for years, but ""the world"" only starts to care when he kills a UN forensics expert working on the mass graves full of people recently executed in this war-torn country.  Aviva Masters (Brooke Langton), the network's animal specialist, is all gung ho to go, as is a famous herpetologist determined to catch the creature alive.  Orlando Bloom, in the form of cameraman Steven Johnson, is also sent along with the others; he's definitely the most memorable character, but that's largely because he's playing the stereotypical role of comic relief -I'm not sure who thought the idea of sending a black man to Africa and stressing him out to the point that he starts seeing slavery in a positive light (anything to get out of Africa) was a good idea, but the fact is that he's the only real entertainment on display here.

The trip to the croc's hunting grounds is possibly even more dangerous that the mission itself, as you can be caught in the crossfire of the long-standing civil war just about anywhere.  While Gustave the crocodile certainly does his share of killing, a local warlord calling himself Little Gustave is the true menace roaming this land, executing people at will.  Personally, I have nothing but admiration and respect for the crocodile; sure, he's huge and it's certainly a tragedy that innocent folks are dying by his claws and teeth, but the big guy is just doing what comes naturally to him. A crocodile has to eat, you know - and there's no doubt that he's definitely one bad dude with a very large appetite.  I thought the special effects (you didn't think they worked with a real crocodile, did you?) were fairly impressive - and I loved the most significant kill scene, as it serves up one of those juicy morsels that we gorehounds deeply appreciate.  I was also impressed that the special effects guys didn't go overboard on the CGI design.  If they made T-shirts for crocodiles, this guy would definitely need a size XXL, but he's not some Godzilla-sized monster.

All in all, Primeval is a pretty decent effort that transcends the strict monster movie limitations of its genre, actually putting forth a political point about the plight of Africans in places such as Darfur, Rwanda, and Burundi pretty effectively.  Several plot twists kept my attention from ever flagging (as did my worry for a cute little dog that kept turning up in dangerous situations), and I found the ending perfectly suited to the story.  In my book, Primeval is definitely worth watching.",1191283200,,3760,4.730474732006126

The first thing you'll notice when you see the beast of the film (dubbed Gustave) is that the CGI effects borderline passable and made for TV bad.  Combine this with the cardboard acting (Purcell is asleep at the wheel, and Jones is the standard joke cracking sidekick) and civilian direction, and you get this exercise in B-movie mediocrity.

Imagine my surprise when I went into the theater to see this flick and I found out it was about a huge Nile Crocodile.

How can they actually call this a serial killer film when it is about a freakin' croc? I was expecting a true to life Hannibal Lecter killer or maybe a Zodiac who was still out prowling around.  I wanted FBI manhunts and profilers working all hours of the night to try and get a break in the case.

Nothing.

Instead, I got a croc flick that was even more dissapointing than Lake Placid.

The acting was atrocious.  The CGI was obvious.  It was horrible.  The story was non existant. I have yet to meet anybody who has seen this pile that felt that they spent their time wisely watching this. Please save yourself the trouble and pass on by.  Very dissapointing.

Which is a shame because the true tale of the real Gustave is actually quite fascinating.

The journalist meet a few local villagers and hook up with a crocodile expert. However, their lives are threatened by much more than just a crocodile when the cameraman accidentally films men from a local warlord's army executing a tribal holy man and his family.

The crocodile does play an important part in this movie; but I felt that it became more of a movie about the Burundi civil war; its war lords; and a general statement about ravaged Africa as a whole. Some people, I have read, did not like this movie. I think its worth a try, I certainly enjoyed it.

In addition to the creature, the team has to contend with some vicious tribal leaders who are waging an intense civil war in the region.

Afflicted with a paltry budget, ""Primeval"" is marred by uneven acting, cheap-looking special effects and the all-too-common chauvinistic attitude that sees Africans as either malefactors intent on slaughtering their own people or incompetent victims just waiting for some knight-in-shining-armor Westerners to come riding in on their white horses to save them.

The opening scene is somewhat interesting.  A United Nations group is checking out what they think is another mass grave in Africa when it turns out to be something different namely a giant killer crocodile named Gustave (Really.  He is supposedly still out there dinning up and down the Rusizi River that is his home: this film is inspired by true events as opposed to being a true story).  This 2007 film is ill-served by the gaudy post-modern opening credits because the whole point is that somewhere out there is a real monster eating hundreds of people and this looks like it is setting up ""Se7en"" or something grittier like ""Hostel.""

Using the ""Jaws"" typology, news producer Tim Manfrey (Dominic Purcell) is the Chief Brody character who does not want to be there when he is sent to Africa to bring the monster back alive, Mathew Collins (Gideon Emery) is the Matt Hooper science geek with the gadgets, and Jacob Krieg (Jurgen Prochnow) is the Quint character who everybody should be listening to before people start dying.  Instead of town fathers concerned about taking the ""summer dinks"" for everything they can on the 4th of July, we have soldiers going around lopping off heads and killing civilians for essentially the same reason.  Where Manfrey is different is that he brings his romantic interest, Aviva Masters (Brooke Langton) along for the ride, and has a wisecracking cameraman, Steven Johnson (Orlando Jones) who always has something to say on every subject from halitosis to Darfur.  But you worry about him because the funny guy is usually one of the first to go in a monster movie.

There is an interesting sub-text to this film that would have been well worth exploring, because Gustav has eaten literally hundreds of natives and it is not until a white woman become the entree that the ""world"" takes an interest and decides to go do something about it.  But instead the film puts the characters between a rock, in the form of the giant croc, and a hard place, namely the Brundi-Rhwandi border, where every thug has a gun.  The dynamic is that if you are worried about the croc, the guys with the guns show up, and when things get ugly with the thugs, expect Gustave to save the day.  To put it another way, every time you forget the other half of the movie, it comes back into play.  Eventually the idea of capturing Gustave is forgotten as the survivors try to avoid both the croc and the thugs, and I swear I was going to round up on this film until Manfrey articulates a link between the genocide and the monster that might be true, but ironically made it all seem unreal just because it was given such dramatic weight it capsized the moment.  The ending is fairly predictable once you understand the three sides involved, but let us not pretend that the irony is a divine solution to the situation.

The movie was filmed in South Africa and all I can say is that things sure have changed since John Huston took Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn to Africa to shoot ""The African Queen.""  You travel thousands of miles to make THIS movie?  I did think that drirector Michael Katleman and especially film editor Gabriel Wrye did above average work here, much better than I would have expected and probably better than the production deserved. However, ultimately, there simply is not enough of the croc in this film and when it does show up the special effects are not up to the challenge.  I just watched ""Jaws"" again earlier this week and, yes, the shark is suggested rather than seen for the first half of the film, but once we finally see Bruce he is an integral part of the action.  For me the special effects are problematic because Gustave moves so damn fast, in or out of the water, that I have trouble buying it.  After all, this is supposed to be the biggest croc in the world.  The lower your expectations, the more you can enjoy watching ""Primeval,"" and it really is a beter ""Jaws"" rip-off than all of the actual ""Jaws"" sequeles combined.",1183420800,,6288,5.444902162718846

The plot is not very good as it intermixes the horror Crocodile and the African political storylines. And as with most bad horror movies, stupid decisions are made at times that wind up killing the actors.
Jurgen Prochnow's talents are wasted in this film as the big-game hunter who is supposed to help the film crew.  Dominic Purcell once again proves he has no acting talent.

where the deathtolls number in the thousands,
as opposed to our being intrigued by the sensationalism
of a 25 ft. man-eating croc, whose body count numbers only in the hundreds?
Should this have been marketed as a horror movie?
Certainly it shouldn't have been marketed as a serial killer flick.
Cause it's essentially ""Lake Placid"" meets ""Blood Diamond""
Except it's not as good as either of those films.
And the most frustrating part is not how they marketed it,
but that you never really get a clear view of Gustave.
(The Croc with the same name as the countries dictator)
Whether it was night or day, it was either too dark, or too blurry with quick, violent movements, to see the beast.
(Probably because they wanted to hide the bad CGI)
(*Sidenote* - While I was on vacation in Florida last year,
I saw the stuffed body of a 25 ft. Croc' named ""Gomek"".
Impressive isn't the word.
The sheer sight of the predator was enough to believe monsters do exist.  And it was a real personal shame this film couldn't clearly capture the enormity of the lizard.)
Orlando Jones is the movies only saving grace,
sinle-handedly keeping the dialogue alive.
Even while he's alone, he keeps it going, by making one the most powerful statements of the movie.
I'm not going to ruin it for you, so don't worry.

Definitely rent before buying.
Especially if you're a horror fan.

MORAL OF THE STORY:

2794221,5,B000OCZ9WS,"After reading numerous negative reviews from critics, I was surprised at how good this film actually was!
Sure there's an enormous CGI crocodile...but it's not like there could actually be a ""real"" crocodile used to film this movie!
The acting wasn't all that bad and the plot was interesting and entertaining!
The characters in the film are not only put in danger by the crocodile, but also by the customs and the surroundings of Africa and it's inhabitants!
So,if you're looking for Lake Placid...please pass this one up,
but if you're looking for a better movie with more depth...then check this one out!
On another note, Brooke Langton stars in the film and it is ALWAYS a pleasure when she's around!",1182902400,,704,4.8264462809917354
2794222,2,B000OCZ9WS,The Croc was so cartoony I thought I was watching the sequel to Pete's Dragon. At no time in the movie are you fooled by the croc. When the croc runs it's even funnier than watching Steven Seagal run. The direct to video Crocodile movies look better in a lot of ways.,1182470400,2,267,4.153846153846154
2794223,5,B000OCZ9WS,"My Oppinion: Primeval is a great creature movie. I've alays enjoyed these types of films.

About The Movie: Primeval is based on a real life 25 foot man eating crocodile. The movie sets in africa where the thing actually lives. The movie is about a crew of news reporters who are sent catch the croc on film or catch the croc its self. In the middle of trying to get the killer croc one f news memeber played by orlando bloom accidentaly catches an exucution on tape and that they are now on the bad guys most wanted list. did a metion that africa is under civil war. well they got themeselves in a fine mess, Killer croc, merssinaries and civil war soldiers oh my. can they escape or will they get eaten, shot or beheaded. well you'll just have to find out.

My second oppinion. Even though this is based on a true story the most scariest part is that the Crocodile is still alive. This movie rocks i don't care what any body else says.",1182211200,,937,4.288135593220339
2794224,2,B000OCZ9WS,"Once again Hollywood has mislead us into watching a movie. If you were to watch the trailers you would think this was going to be a slasher thriller of gigantic proportions. What a hoax!
It is hard to say just what this movie wanted to be about. The plot has been gone over, so I won't do that. What I will say is that it starts out gathering a herd of 'unsuspecting' victims and relocating them to where the danger is... all typical.
However, on the way, we learn of the political unrest in the land they travel to. From there on this movie flips back and forth from being the slasher/thriller to being an expose of murder and mayhem generated by the local king.
It flips and flops so poorly that it never dwells in any area long enough which is distracting. The acting is poor save for Orlando Bloom.
The only thing this movie does do is pull the two plots together in at the end... for about 3 minutes.
What could they have been thinking?
I don't know about anyone else out there... but I'm getting really tired of the 'Bait and switch' routine that Hollywood is doing to get people to watch movies.
If you're absolutely bored and up for ANY kind of distraction this movie will suffice... while you do laundry or cooking or something else.
Otherwise... pass it by. Honestly isn't worth the money they spent on it.",1182038400,4,1316,4.397540983606557
8184565,4,B000OCZ9WS,"It was an enjoyable movie but I am tired of Orlando Jones having the same stick in every movie. ""The black guy always ..."" just fill in the blank because it was the same character who played in evolution. That's not saying I don't like him or think he's a good actor and you definitely still feel the suspense and hope his character makes it out alive. It's pretty much just the Warlords that you hope become crocodile Chow.",1522972800,,424,4.379746835443038
8184566,1,B000OCZ9WS,Movie spent more time on the civil war there than on the croc. And the croc is made to be a super monster with unnatural abilities... like being able to bust down trees and chase people on land for hundreds of yards...just lame,1522540800,,227,4.3023255813953485
8184567,4,B000OCZ9WS,"Primeval is one of those infamous movies that was not really bad, just poorly marketed. Critics weren't allowed to screen it before it was released, making people more than a bit suspicious. I am one of those people who remembers the trailers for this movie on TV. The trailer claims that it's about one of the most prolific serial killers of all time, and that 'he is not human'. You've probably heard by now that Primeval is about a real-life giant crocodile who is said to lurk (or have lurked) in Africa. This beast is a man-eater, and his name is Gustave. I've discussed this film with some others who saw it, and we agreed that it could've done well without hiding the crocodile theme. I think the movie would have even benefited if they admitted this from the start. These creature flicks have been a popular genre in movies since the industry started, and the camp factor is part of the appeal for most fans. Snakes on a Plane was already a box office hit the year before this debuted. Basically, there's already enough people who like these kinds of movies, and while it might not have been the highest grossing film of the year, it would've boosted its performance. The only legitimate complaint is that it may have been too similar to Lake Placcid. However, I watched it with a relative who had seen Placcid. They gave it a thumbs up, preferred Primeval by a longshot, and said Placcid was a dud in comparison.

A warning, though: Some may see it as exploitive because of how it deals with the political and military conflicts in Africa. This was mentioned by some critics of the film.",1521676800,,1596,4.560975609756097
