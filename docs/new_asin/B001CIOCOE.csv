8287771,5,B001CIOCOE,"Okay, I'm biased because I was an actor in the film (night clerk at the Adolphus Hotel). It was my first SAG film and allowed me to join SAG. I had read the script and loved it -- was thrilled to get cast in the part I did. Director Amy Talkington was wonderful to work with, as were stars Tom Wilkinson, Frances Fisher, and Nick Stahl; all of them were as down-to-earth as we hope movie stars would be. The 14 hours I spent on set to shoot my scenes were some of the best experiences I've had as an [unknown] actor. The on-set joy makes it to the screen.

This is a different kind of buddy comedy, with family at heart.",1456099200,2,620,4.081967213114754
8287772,4,B001CIOCOE,A very funny romp of humor and sexuality. Wilkinson does a great job and story is just fun and funny!,1447632000,,101,4.1
8287773,4,B001CIOCOE,"This was okay. I think teens would enjoy it more than I did, but .... I think I wanted to see a Zack (Sunset Strip) type role done by Nick Stahl.",1437004800,,145,3.7096774193548385
8287774,2,B001CIOCOE,"It's ok. Turns black and white three times throughout the movie saying something like ""for viewing purposes only"" not too happy about that.",1405123200,,139,5.086956521739131
8287775,5,B001CIOCOE,"Very funny, and a little bit sad.",1404172800,,33,3.857142857142857
8287776,1,B001CIOCOE,"The Night of the White Pants is a waste of film and your money, unless you do not mind your brain and soul being used as a garbage dump!
Naomi Richardson",1306886400,2,153,3.967741935483871
8287777,4,B001CIOCOE,"This will definitely be the ""gateway"" film for Talkington. This movie is so quotable you'll want to watch it over and over to make sure you get all the gems in it. From the Wikipedia discussion over ""punk"" at the bar to the heart-to-heart behind bars, this movie made me wish I was in the family room playing Perquacky with all the wacky Hagans and Raff... and the music in the film is awesome.",1224806400,5,394,4.337837837837838
8287778,5,B001CIOCOE,"Horace Walpole said ""This world is a comedy to those that think, a tragedy to those that feel.""  Night of the White Pants is a feast for all those who both think and feel---a rare treat and a hell of a ride.",1224633600,3,207,3.9285714285714284
