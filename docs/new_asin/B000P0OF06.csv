8188064,5,B000P0OF06,"Right on! In the country where hockey is king, Don Cherry is the royal highness. A former minor-league player and big-league coach with the Boston Bruins and Colorado Rockies, Cherry's ""Coach's Corner"" segment on Hockey Night in Canada every Saturday night is the highest-rated five minutes in Canadian T.V. His opinions are harsh, his style is unique, but hockey wouldn't be the same without him! His annual DVD release is always the best-selling home video in Canada. Don reminisces on hockey's greatest plays, best playoff goals, and some great 7th game overtime magic. Many clips are rare and being shown to the public for the first time. Included, as always, are the greatest saves, hardest hits, funniest bloopers, and even a tussle or two. Don also picks the hardest hitter of all-time. This video features the best the NHL has had to offer over the past 60 years.",1176163200,,871,4.891891891891892
