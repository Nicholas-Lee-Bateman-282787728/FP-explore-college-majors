In my opinion this DVD is a good supplement DVD to an addition general comprehensive raw food recipe DVD because its focus bypasses some options that you may be interested in when you are not so busy.  IT is important to solve the real issue of incorporating raw food transition into a life with limited time resources.  We all know (or should remember) that your transition raw food diet is usually much more heavy and complex and therefore tends to require more planning than where you land a year or so later.  This is what this DVD is for, not general raw food info.  The recipes rework the same basic ingredients of tomato, avocado and crackers.  So remember convenience and variety are not always partners.  Overall I would recommend this but not as your only raw food DVD.

I have purchased about 7 raw food DVDs. My top picks for more general information are Raw Food Made Easy by Jenny Cornbleet and Living on Live Food by Alissa Cohen. Both are currently available through Amazon with a coordinating cook book.",1259193600,8,1188,4.641148325358851
