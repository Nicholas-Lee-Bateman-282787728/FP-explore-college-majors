6456139,5,B00L0MIC2K,"This movie is complex, I'll give you that. This is a movie that will make you think so if you're just looking for a straight-out shoot-em-up sci-fi that will give your brain a rest, then this movie may not be for you. Sure it has plenty of great shoot-em-up scenes in it that certainly makes it enjoyable, but it has some real depth to the story and characters as well with a complex plot that will keep you guessing and make you think. I personally feel that that's what makes this a truely great sci-fi. It seems that most people now days only care about action and killing in sci-fis now instead of a truely thought-provoking story. It was those thought-provoking stories that made me fall in love with sci-fis in the first place. This movie is a dark movie that has plenty of action and killing in it, but it's way more than that, and if you're a true lover of science-fiction then I highly recommend this movie. Because it's a great one and would be a shame to miss!",1409961600,,971,4.370165745856354

Like CAPRINI, it was supposed to be the first film in a ""franchise"" (of awful films).  While having all of CAPRINI's faults, it also has incompetent sound direction so that around one quarter of the lines are inaudible,  Plot and large number of characters similar to STAR WARS except that here Luke decides to buddy up with DARTH VADER after watching DARTH SLIT HIS MOTHER's AND SISTER's THROATS.

6456161,2,B00L0MIC2K,"The film opens with a complex narration by the ""Overseer"" (Neil Johnson). He speaks in a loud whisper and competes with the soundtrack to be heard (F- for sound editor Phillip Bladh). He is speaking in 2518 about a master human race which accelerated/created human evolution on earth. There was a great federation which went to war with artificial intelligence and won and a search for DNA and something discovered that is 200,000 years old and  the Second Federation has problems with rebels. It jumps 200 years later as we then see a man killed for speaking out and 18 years later his son John Worthy (Darren Jacobs) joins the Federation which killed his father as a star fighter pilot.  They ask him if he was related to the rebel and John says ""NO"" because he knows that a federation that can trace DNA back to the beginning of time will have no idea whose his father.

Yes John Worthy to no surprise rebels against the Second Federation and joins up with the rebels. And if you managed to have everything figured out we get thrown a twist at the end at which point I didn't know what had happened or for that matter, who to pull for. All I know is that they plan a sequel. Now I thought the Overseer was over 200 years old so how could he have a sister that is still alive? Yes, I was confused.

The plot complexity and planet jumping (with no explanation how they do that) made the whole film a waste of time with bad acting and dialogue to boot. Darren Jacobs lead a group of horrendous actors with maybe E.J. De La Pena being the bright spot. And what was that at the end? Four women vs. an entire planet? A waste of special effects.

If you plan on watching it, take notes.

6456165,4,B00L0MIC2K,"This film really surprised me.  i thought it would have been terrible considering all the bad reviews, but to be honest, there is so much in this film that I have to write a review.  I think that it is possible that if you watch the film casually, you won't understand the subtleties.  The film is as rich in worlds and characters as something like Dune, and like Dune, you have to watch it a few times to understand what is going on.  The first time I watched the film I was ok, with it, but the second and third viewing, it opened up to a whole new world.  If you are into Marvel films, then this may be too complex for you, but for my money this is thinking man's Sci-Fi.  I especially liked the jolly character and the Torgus fat guy.  They have great chemistry.  I think this film is a setup for another film, which according to imdb has already gone under the lens.  I look forward to the continuing story of Worthy and his crew.",1413417600,,935,4.17877094972067

6456167,1,B00L0MIC2K,"Have you ever seen a movie that wasn't just bad, but almost hypnotically bad? A fractal of wretchedness that reveals new intricate facets of DEAR LORD WHAT IS THAT? as you look deeper and deeper, until you realize that this is some elaborate torture method devised by Beelzebub?

Yes, I'm engaging in hyperbole. Why not?

Admittedly, ""Starship Rising"" is not quite THAT unpleasant, because writer/director Neil Johnson clearly has an interesting story to tell. He just has no idea how to tell it effectively. And so the result is an awkward, claustrophobic film, which appears to be equal parts Star Wars, Star Trek, and ""Dune""... but without any of the artistic merit.

The story is confusing and overstuffed, but I shall try to summarize. John Worthy (Darren Jacobs) is a pilot for the dystopian Federation, which is about to go to war with the religion-driven Terra Nostra. He's assigned to the Federation's greatest warship, Starship One -- but when they are commanded to vaporize Old Earth, John suddenly decides to openly mutiny, killing his captain and causing them to crash on Earth.

Meanwhile, the Overseer of the Federation (Johnson) has left on some kind of secret mission to find the Masters who are responsible for the human race... or maybe the sequel to ""Prometheus."" Anyway, John Worthy (symbolic name!) suddenly becomes the symbol of revolution, and the cruel General Gustav (Ralph Guzzo) pursues him with only one intent.

In a way, I almost feel bad criticizing ""Starship Rising,"" despite it being worse than a stab to the gonads.
It's kind of like kicking a person who is paralyzed, unconscious and half-immersed in cement -- so inept that mockery feels mean. I have literally seen Internet review shows that were more convincing as sci-fi dramas, but dammit, Neil Johnson is just trying so hard.

It's just a shame that nothing about this works. It feels like he had a grand space opera in mind, borrowing chunks and ideas from ""Star Wars,"" ""Star Trek"" and ""Dune,"" but nothing ever quite gels together. Instead it feels overstuffed and confusing, bouncing from one group of confusingly lookalike characters to another. And after Starship One crashes on Old Earth, the plot slows to a crawl, punctuated by the occasional deaths of people we don't care and women yelling at John.

And there are a thousand other little things that don't work -- the sound mixing is awful, with every click and creak clearly audible. The sets are dark, dingy and claustrophobic. The costumes look like they were assembled from the contents of a hardware store. The lighting tends to make all the actors look jaundiced. And I'm not sure why the female soldiers of the Federation are all wearing thick makeup, cleavage and ""Mob Wives"" hair.

And oh, the writing. Even if performed by the greats of stage and screen, the dialogue is bad enough to make your ears bleed. The Overseer is particularly bad, often scraping out profanity-laden cliches (""I am a f***ing god"") in a voice that sounds like a laryngitic goat.

And of course, the acting is mesmerizingly awful (""YOU swore an OATH... of ALLEGIANCE!""). Oddly enough, a lot of the people in this movie look kind of alike. It actually becomes difficult to tell who is on what side, and when a minor character is brutally slain... it was hard to care, because I couldn't recognize her. Jacobs is the only one who sticks out... and that's only because he's the main character. He certainly doesn't have the charisma of a great leader -- although part of that is because John is a hideously flat ""hero"" character, whose motivations are a complete mystery. Why does he mutiny? Because INSPIRING MUSIC.

There is one thing that Johnson gets right, and that is a lot of the CGI effects. Considering the low budget this must have had, the cityscapes, holographic interfaces and some of the space battles are quite good. It's a shame the rest of it couldn't measure up to this standard.

""Starship Rising"" doesn't so much end as... stop. Meaning that the sci-fi world is destined to be dive-bombed by an inevitable second part. Somehow, I suspect it won't be much better.",1412035200,3,4114,4.8544935805991445

6456171,1,B00L0MIC2K,"Plot

This story is horrendous. I did my best, but I couldn't make sense of the plot, though I thought I could make head or tails of it when I was watching the trailer. Basically there is this spaceship and there are some people on it and around them there are a number of populated planets and moons, yet ask me what this all means and I won't be able to tell you.

Character Development

I didn't even know any of the characters so I cannot say if any of the developed, but somehow I doubt it.

Acting

The acting, the hand to hand combat, the gun fighting and everything in between was awful. It just shows that you need some knowhow and talent to put a film together and it certainly helps when you got a working script for your actors to act from. I don't think I believe a single word anyone had said.

Overview

I gave this movie a chance because some of those that review it before me left room in their criticisms. Let me close that gap and say there is no way I am going to be watching the sequel. If you can believe it this film doesnt finish and leaves an opening to keep going. That would be a mistake because there is nothing good to continue. Better to make a fresh start in a completely new direction.",1410739200,2,1217,4.153191489361702
6456172,1,B00L0MIC2K,"I bought it because I get a kick out of some of these movies.  This one tried to mix sex with CGI effects.  The plot is not well developed and to top it off, it was supposed to be followed by a continuation - which I did not find, but then decided to write off as a waste anyway.",1410480000,8,279,3.711864406779661
6456173,1,B00L0MIC2K,"I wanted to like this movie. I like space opera, and there just aren't many films in that genre being made these days, so I was ready to be open to it, and forgiving of minor glitches here and there. But this thing just beat me down.

The sound mixing combines soft dialogue with loud music and sound effects so much of the dialogue is somewhere between difficult and impossible to understand. A closed captioned option might have helped (no such luck) but I'm not sure because what was decipherable still didn't make much sense. The plot is not complex; it is just hopelessly convoluted and complicated. (There is a difference.) The characters are not very interesting. Lots of boring backstory doesn't serve to advance the plot at all. When you do understand what's going on, like when you figure out that all the women on one planet are going to rise up and kill all the men, you just sort of scratch your head and blink. Some of the CGI work is very good, but then you get lots of scenes of actors standing in front of an obvious CGI backdrop with ""crowds"" of people (the same couple actors moving back and forth across the camera field) jostling past them. Some of the scene identifiers are wonderfully wacky, like the one that places the action near the ""municipal limits"" of the planet Terra Nostra. There are lots of pretty good-looking sets, costumes, and props, but some of them are laughably bad--like the scene when the hero fires a ray gun and the ""ray gun"" is actually a toy flintlock pistol. I am not kidding. I think that must have been a practice take or something that got edited into the film by mistake.

 It has a good-looking cast that seems to know its way around in front of a camera, and a lot of the actors looked as if they were giving this a hell of a good try, but the script just wasn't there.",1410048000,11,1823,4.419642857142857

8662984,4,B00L0MIC2K,"You have to admire Neil Johnson for his intentions. Starship Rising is the first of a pair of films following a band of 'heroes' attempting to restore balance to a universe in chaos. There are warring races with politics and battles across numerous planets. This is an enormous story which has been attempted on the tiniest of budgets. While this is a fantastic effort, ultimately it's not the rewarding experience for the audience the filmmakers would have hoped for. The plot is badly paced, constantly cutting from one location to another without any real explanation or warning. And I wasn't sure who was part of the Federation and who was from Terra Nostra, what their values were, or even why they were fighting. But then the story would shift and inject an achingly long scene with just two characters talking about the bad things that have happened to them in their lives. Watching this film is a bit like being on a roller coaster that's not properly secured to it's track. In regard to the acting, some of it is just horrible, while some of the performances are OK. The special effects are commendable considering the budget constraints - this film is almost entirely built with special effects. But the practical effects are a dead giveaway that there was little money to throw around. The soundtrack is just Dolby Digital stereo but it actually performed quite well - not being too heavy on the bass and I could generally catch everything the actors were saying, although it was a shame that the script was littered with incomprehensible technobabble. I have written this review after a second viewing about twelve months after the initial viewing, and I'm still in the dark about exactly what was happening, but regardless I've just received Starship Apocalypse in the mail and I'm looking forward to seeing how the story ends.",1454716800,,1840,4.844444444444444
