8262283,3,B0016GLYN4,"Not for beginners!  Hence the ""Series 2"" part of the title.  There are 3 Combinations of moves.  Each Combination has 3 stages. Excellent narration!  Combinations are harder than the one before.  I think all of the examples are repeated enough times.  Each stage has sections for the leader, follower, and as a couple. A lot of combinations of moves are taught.  One CAVEAT:  I think it's International Style; not American.  But I still enjoyed it. It's worth the discounted price I paid through Amazon.",1237161600,,503,4.892857142857143
8262284,1,B0016GLYN4,"This seems to be international style, not American, which isn't what I expected.  Instructors are British (fine in itself) but they've adopted the new ""leader"" and ""follower"" phraseology which can be positively distracting at times for the student.

Biggest complaint is that there is very little actual content on this, they just repeat the same lessons over and over, each time going a little faster than the time before.

I've bought much, much better rumba dvds here on Amazon.",1226016000,2,481,5.063291139240507
