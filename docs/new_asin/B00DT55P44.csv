5854479,5,B00DT55P44,Funny and innovative; good character development; left me wishing there would be a season seven; liked the extras on how they put things together,1386374400,,145,5.083333333333333
5854480,4,B00DT55P44,"Good concluding (?) season.  The guild is continuing to get outside, with Vork even spending some time in the sun.",1384992000,,114,4.7
5854481,5,B00DT55P44,Great ending to a fantastic series. There is also a box set if you are looking for the full collection.,1384732800,,103,4.2
5854482,5,B00DT55P44,"I was sad to see the series end, but at least it ended with a great finale. Very notably discharged",1383782400,,99,4.0
5854483,5,B00DT55P44,"Love this show, had to get it as soon as it came out!  If you are a gamer you will love this!  A must watch",1383091200,,107,3.24
5854484,5,B00DT55P44,I love the show. I love Felicia. I thought the last season brought us to a point where there was real growth in each character and that the reality of life began to have meaning for them. How did these changes occur? Buy the dvd or watch it on Youtube. Felicia is one hell of a talent.,1381881600,,285,4.017543859649122
5854485,5,B00DT55P44,"I'm a huge fan of the Guild and have been for a very long time. Even if you're not a gamer (and I'll confess that I don't have the patience or mental fortitude for it, the Guild is a show that you can still relate to. It's clever, funny, and oh so entertaining in its wealthy of richly developed characters and elegantly handled story arcs. As a non-gamer, it helped me to understand my brother better, and from the time we started watching it together, it's helped our relationship enormously. My only complaint is that it ever had to end <3",1381104000,5,542,4.376237623762377
5854496,5,B00DT55P44,"The Guild was always creative, and the fact that the three principals had done improv together was clear.

In the final season, the crew uses our familiarity with the characters to throw some curveballs.

Our leading lady gets her ""perfect"" job for the perfect guy at her favorite game company.

What could go wrong?

In a time honored tradition since Crosby and Hope, everything falls apart until the most important thing stands in stark relief, her enduring (albeit quirky) friendships.

Well done Ms. Day!

I highly recommend this DVD.

in service,

Rich",1401840000,2,557,4.978260869565218
5854497,5,B00DT55P44,I am a big fan of this show and the cast. This is supposed to be the final season and it did not disappoint. Great concept.,1397779200,,123,3.769230769230769
5854498,5,B00DT55P44,"The title of this review says it all. I would watch Felicia Day read the phone book.  Especially if she had the rest of the Guild cast behind her doing their normal wacked out things. Logically, the next step is for Codex and Co to create their own game. Either that or, ala Tron...be sucked INTO the game. This could work out for them. She could TOTALLY have the next season be rendered as a video game!

WE WANT MORE GUILD!!

Maybe Felicia will follow the example of her fellow geek goddess Kristen Bell and start a Kickstarter  campaign to get a Guild movie up and running.

Until then, I will keep watching Geek and Sundry, Supernatural...and be on the lookout for whatever this talented young lady and her fellow guilders pop up on (ahem...BIG BANG THEORY! CALL THIS GIRL! Even if its for one scene at Stewarts Comic shop where she so TOTALLY Schools our boys they all follow her around like puppy dogs! Even Howard and Leonard.

There is nothing like a geek goddess to shake things up!.",1395446400,,992,4.483333333333333
5854499,5,B00DT55P44,What a gem! We had already purchased the previous five seasons and looked forward to this final installment of the hugely popular series. Felicia Day's masterful comic performance supported by the tremendous talents of her funny cast are brought to a climax in this season. Every season just got better and better. My only complaint is that the series has finally come to an end! It's a great season and probably the best of the series.,1393545600,,436,4.75
5854500,5,B00DT55P44,"It's sad to see this series end. But, Felicia managed to wrap it up in a satisfying way. Yes, you can watch these free online. But why? For this price, you can get this DVD and enjoy them without the hassle of streaming.

The Guild brought web series' to the main stream. For good reason. Well written, well acted, and you really care about the characters. EVen if you don't game, you won't have a problem identifying with these people.",1391644800,,436,4.45
5854501,5,B00DT55P44,"So sad no more show.  I enjoyed all the ""seasons""

Like to support so I plunked down for the disks.

I would live a blu ray collection of all the seasons.  Probably would fit on 1 disk!

So Felicia... ah? eh? ah???!",1390953600,,215,4.023809523809524
5854502,4,B00DT55P44,"I have bought every season of the guild on DVD as I am a bit of a geek and honestly have a crush on Felicia Day this is in my Wheel house.
For me Season five was by far the best and season six seemed more of a post climactic farewell season in order to wrap everything  up and let you know the characters you love will be just fine going forward in their lives.
It wasn't the best season but it had its high points and for a collector of course it is a no brainer.
The DVD includes another of the music videos that The guild has been doing for a few seasons and this maybe the best one yet and is surely an incentive for buying this DVD.",1388966400,,637,3.8625954198473282
5854503,4,B00DT55P44,"If you've seen the first five seasons of 'The guild', whether online, on DVD, or both, you will notice that this season is a LOT more involved with other things other than the Knights of Good sitting behind their computers and interacting via microphones and headphones.

This season has more of everything - secondary characters, extras, subplots.  the gist of the season is that Codex gets a job as the creator of the game's assistant. And everyone is trying to get him to release another expansion of the game - an underwater world. Everyone who worked on it liked it. But a single negative comment about anything, puts the guy into a tailspin, and can't make a decision about anything.

I have to say, I think I liked the earlier seasons better when it was mostly just the core characters. But if you have already purchased the first five seasons, then you cannot NOT get this one!
And who knows, maybe it will be your favorite season.

The extras include a behind the scenes on an almost daily basis, cast audio commentary, and the video ""I'm the One Who's Cool.""",1388448000,,1068,4.605263157894737
5854504,5,B00DT55P44,"I purchased these for my son who is a big fan. Personally, I can not make heads or tails of the material. However, it made a great gift for him.",1387065600,,144,3.8333333333333335
5854505,5,B00DT55P44,"I am so sad that this show is over. I think it ended well but I still feel like there was more there that could have been told. Maybe it will get sponsored again and get picked back up. This was a good season and I loved that Sid (Felicia Day) got to work on The Game, it made for a really interesting story line.",1386460800,,313,3.830769230769231

8597477,4,B00DT55P44,"The show is great, Felicia is a stallion.  Mine was damaged in shipping, but it happens.  I was disappointed when it arrived due to the damage, but that feeling quickly went away when I watched the show.",1475280000,,203,4.45945945945946
8597478,5,B00DT55P44,Arrived quickly and in specified condition. This is a great show. Would recommend. Not for younger kids.,1443398400,,104,5.176470588235294
8597479,5,B00DT55P44,"Purchased for my husband, he's watched every episode online (for the entire series) but I wanted him to have the DVD collection to match and that's why I bought it.",1436572800,,164,4.5
8597480,5,B00DT55P44,Fun series. Sad to see it end.,1430006400,,30,3.4285714285714284

8597482,5,B00DT55P44,"Sad that it was the last season, but at least it wasn't a ""canceled"" series stuck with an unresolved cliffhanger (which I am all too familiar with, being a sci-fi fan). They tied everything up pretty nicely: were you expecting anything less than a happy ending for our guildies?

For me the real treasure chests within dvd sets of The Guild are the extras.
- Commentary and behind the scenes features provide some insight into what the actors are like IRL, which to me is just as interesting as following their characters.
- ""I'm the One That's Cool"" is the best music video I've seen in forever...
- If you are an extremely hardcore fan, you might care that they even included a pdf of the script for season 6.",1408406400,,711,4.469230769230769
8597483,5,B00DT55P44,"Wonderful series. Sadly, season 6 marks the last season of this show. A lot of characters we've grown to know leave forever. BUT, if you buy the whole 6 seasons, you can visit them as often as you like.",1406851200,,202,4.205128205128205
8597484,5,B00DT55P44,Was sad to see this series end. Even though I was not a WOW player it made me laugh,1405036800,,83,3.4210526315789473
