8747641,5,B01AKPMAHA,"America's Blues is a thoughtfully composed series of interviews with mainstream and more off-the-beaten-path Blues legends, a great soundtrack, and a layout that delivers a comprehensive look at the impact of the Blues in the US and beyond. It explores the resonance of the art form in multiple genres of music like Gospel, Jazz, Country, Hip Hop, and Rock 'n Roll, the deep racial and cultural heritage of the Blues, as well as impacts on other aspects of culture and fashion. It definitely details and celebrates the history of a uniquely American identity. Strongly recommended viewing for anybody who likes an incisive, smart music documentary - it's already even won some awards from what I understand.",1456099200,3,707,5.103448275862069
