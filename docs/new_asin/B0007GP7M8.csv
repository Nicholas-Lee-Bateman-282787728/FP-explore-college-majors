2211637,5,B0007GP7M8,"this movie is great, but not for everyone else's reasons. it is the funniest thing ever.  the animation is horid, the music dreadful, and the ""message"" gets completely lost in the hilarity.",1121817600,3,189,4.90625
2211638,5,B0007GP7M8,this movie has lessons on the way we treat others and how they are humans with feelings and jesus can be in the form of the lowliest being. we never know that we are treating jesus bad when we mistreat others.,1391558400,,209,4.121951219512195

2211641,5,B0007GP7M8,"This is a wonderful video, a great story about how we affect others' lives. It is not as 'smooth' as some claymation, but wonderful just the same. Watch the flickering candle. Highly recommended. This is a must-see for your family.",1359849600,,231,4.8
2211642,5,B0007GP7M8,"Absolutley charming and true.  Leo Tolstoys daughter narrates this classic, she had asked him ""Of all the stories you have written which is your favorite?""  And he said,""Martin the Cobbler."" It is so precious to see the unfoldment of a change of heart with Martin towards his fellow man. Perfect for all ages.",1347408000,,309,4.811320754716981

Tolstoy's own daughter introduces this wonderful, enchanting, animated Christmas Motion Picture. Other 5 star reviewers masterfully tell the story better than I; so I'll just add what Tolstoy himself thought of the story: Many people do not understand the introduction and words of Tolstoy's daughter because of her accent. Her words and the introduction are so important that I will quote the words here, ""When father was asked if 'War and Peace' was his greatest work, he said, 'NO, MY GREATEST WORK WAS 'WHAT AND IF I' AND 'MARTIN THE COBBLER'.""

One of the most loved novelists in the history of the world believed this simple short story was his best work! Nothing could better dramatize the words of Jesus, ""Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.""

If Tolstoy were alive and could see Will Vinton's magical, claymation version of the story of 'Martin the Cobbler' (with music you will never forget), I believe he would give the film 5 Stars!

2211644,5,B0007GP7M8,"Based on the story by Leo Tolstoy, ""Where Love Is"", this is the story of Martin, a old shoe cobbler in a rural Russian village who is bitter with the world from the loss of his wife. As he tells a priest, me and God do not get along anymore. The priest is asking Martin to make a new cover for a very important holy book, and while Martin does not feel worthy of the job due to his lack of faith, the priest gently prods him to read some of the book and give the job a try. Martin dreams that night about an important message from the Lord, and sees his hand at work the next day. It changes his life as well as others he comes in contact with in a very inspiring way. This is a 27 minute claymation film from 1977, made by Will Vinton. The music, animation, character design, voice acting and script were all well done. A nice surprise was the intro and narration from Tolstoy's own daughter. I have enjoyed other films by Vinton in this series of DVD's, especially the First Christmas DVD that has 3 stories on it. Shopping at Amazon.com made my search for this rare movie easy and affordable.",1271635200,5,1095,4.194312796208531

2211646,4,B0007GP7M8,"This is a great video.  I'm using it in our Sunday School program, and the kids have enjoyed it.  The accent is a bit tough for the younger kids to make out, but other than that, it's been a hit.  Thanks!",1178668800,2,204,3.926829268292683
2211647,5,B0007GP7M8,"Claymation is a lost art now-a-days. :)  I remember when I was just a child at home, my parents would rent this movie reel from our home library every Christmas without fail.  When seeing this on DVD, I snatched it up.  It still holds the warm, friendly feeling in me as it did when I was a little girl.  Love this movie, and recommend for entire family viewing!",1171152000,4,362,4.279411764705882

8047269,5,B0007GP7M8,"The story is an inspiration and applies to humans everywhere regardless of race or creed.  Sharing, loving, mending disputes, giving to those in need, and faith that kind actions do bear fruit by others emulating them is timeless.  In the introductory remarks, Alexandra Tolstoy, Leo's (the Russian literary giant),youngest daughter, gives a great introduction, saying that her father's favorite story ""Where Love is, God is"" comes forward in this story of Martin (adapted from it )and it provides"" food for the soul"".  Everyone needs the message in this story,young and old, and should practice it all the year, not just during the holidays.",1419379200,3,642,5.213592233009709

8047271,5,B0007GP7M8,"Leo Tolstoy (War and Peace) created this character and story. Even though the Claymation process looks old-fashioned, that's part of the charm of this simple story of conversion and the search for inner peace. And with all that, the grandkids love to watch it too!",1391731200,,264,4.888888888888889
