8588999,5,B00D3LA6QQ,All my boys loved this show when they were ages 2 thru 4. Like they were speaking their language.,1474416000,,97,4.157894736842105
8589000,5,B00D3LA6QQ,"This is a great show for your little ones. My nephew is two and absolutely loved it. The minute he hears the theme song, he's running for the living room to sit in his little chair and watch, completely enraptured. And its cute and funny enough that us grown ups won't be trying to tune it out. This disc is the whole first 10 episodes of the series. Each episode is about 10 or 12 minutes long. Great family fun.",1441238400,,413,4.175
8589001,5,B00D3LA6QQ,"I am very happy with this purchase. It is a great DVD. My boys, who are both special needs boys, love to watch this. The episodes are good, fun, entertaining and at the same time teach different things. They really keep my kids engaged and entertained. The boys can be heard laughing and talking/interacting as this dvd plays.",1432684800,,326,4.637931034482759
8589002,5,B00D3LA6QQ,My grandson loves his new WOTWOTS and  all of the other kids are screaming for some of their own.  He is easily bored but not with his WOTWOTS. He loves them.,1426896000,,158,4.064516129032258
8589003,5,B00D3LA6QQ,"This is darling and creative! Wish we could get more of the episodes but the rest are in Canadian format which diesnt play on USA players.
As far as the wotwots goes, we love the song, the little language, which isn't complicated nor persnickety, and the innocence of this brother and sister. U won't find anything objectionable and it's not annoying for adults!  I can sit and watch several episodes with my four yr old and not be going crazy it so charming! Yes my 1yr old likes it as much as my four yr old. Give it a try!",1424736000,,525,4.25
8589004,5,B00D3LA6QQ,"I love the WotWots, and so does my daughter (3). The animation is crisp and the ""stories"" are fun and educational without being too pedantic. The characters are adorable, and have a great relationship - they cooperate and share, but have a little sibling tension where they get on each other's nerves, etc. It's wholesome without stifling creativity, suppressing personality, or being condescending.

The only reason I would give this less than 5 stars is that the fact that the main characters (Dotty and Spotty) don't really use much in the way of language. There is a narrator, but I think kids would prefer mimicking the infectious giggles of ""Notty, not"" and ""Wotty, wotty"" of Dotty and Spotty, which doesn't encourage much language development.

The show does a great job of presenting the world as safe and fun to explore/learn, and encourages little ones to enjoy imaginative play. It very much has the warm glow and gentle pacing of New Zealand about it (it's a Kiwi production), which for me is a great nostalgic feeling of a time and place in my childhood.",1412467200,,1067,4.825136612021858
