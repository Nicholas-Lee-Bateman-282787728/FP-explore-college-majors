8682713,5,B00O9OEBMG,"Hydrolic (spelling??) drilling for gold..one massive example of why the world is in the ecological mess it is in..but, this film has bite and breathtaking color. The antagonisms created by the lust for gold are spelled out in a shoot out that has to be seen to be believed..very realistic and violent.

Relationships are favored over the material culture created by gold, and Olivia DeHavlliland's last look at George Brent is in a scene where the sun is setting over an unmarked, as yet undamaged, corner of the earth.",1498608000,,519,4.831460674157303
8682714,4,B00O9OEBMG,The plot isn't much but I love Olivia. The most interesting part was the extensive scenes of the gold miners eroding the dirt cliffs on the river banks with huge power hoses. (You'd never get a permit to stage that today.) It gave me a better sense of what that method of mining was like. The legal ruling that resulted from the conflict between the miners and the farmers was a landmark.,1493251200,,388,4.402777777777778
8682715,5,B00O9OEBMG,"I loved this picture! I would say that the narration at the beginning is a little much and I wish there was a different end shot that fades out at the conclusion of the film....but overall good.

I bought this film because of Olivia de Havilland to add to my collection.",1461628800,,270,4.294117647058823

8682718,5,B00O9OEBMG,I have been wanting this movie for a long time.  I LOVE it.  Thanks amazon for offering it to the public.  This is one I never thought I would own.  When it comes on turner classic movies I always dvr it so I can watch it over and over.,1418428800,2,236,3.7551020408163267
8682719,3,B00O9OEBMG,"Gold Is Where You Find It aspires to epic proportions but doesnt quite make it. Still, theres much to recommend this 1938 feature. It uses the California gold rush and its aftermath as backdrop for the romantic tale of mining engineer Jared Whitney (George Brent, Warners all-purpose male lead of the 30s and 40s) and a wealthy landowners daughter, Serena Ferris (Olivia de Havilland). Reliable Claude Rains plays Col. Ferris, Serenas father, who disapproves of his daughters interest in Jared.

The plot is melodramatic but director Michael Curtiz (Casablanca) handles the spectacle elements handsomely, particularly the climactic scene of a massive dam explosion. An attraction in itself is the vibrant three-strip Technicolor photography, a rarity in movies of the 30s, which showed its full potential a year later in The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind.

There are no bonus extras on this DVD release.",1417046400,3,909,5.1768707482993195
