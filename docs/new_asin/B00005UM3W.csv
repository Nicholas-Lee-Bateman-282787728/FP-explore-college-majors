7954845,1,B00005UM3W,"This DVD was advertized as ""Digitally Remasterd"" etc. Truth is I think this DVD is a third rate copy of a copy. Picture was of extreamly poor quality same goes for the sound. Recomend that the vendor of this DVD take it off the market as it only hurts their image. It is not worth the postage to send back as  an ""item not as described"". This DVD is a throwaway and that is what I will do with it. Will I buy anything else from this vendor? No.",1369958400,4,444,3.9887640449438204
