674820,5,6303451535,"One of the most provocative and haunting World War II films ever made.  This film boasts supurb acting and is well written.  Peter O'Toole is wonderfull as the psychopatice General Tanz, as he is in every role where he plays a character who has lost touch with reality.  His role in this film ranks up there with those he played in The Ruling Class, The Stuntman, and My Favorite Year, only in this film he is much more volatile and psychotic.  Peter O'Toole is one of the best actors of our time and in my opinion the only other actor who could have rivaled Anthony Hopkins for the part of Hannibal Lector.  THIS FILM NEEDS TO BE RELEASED ON DVD.  I only hope that it will be chock full of special features and I have been bombarding The Criterion Collection with title suggestion e-mails and I only hope that they wil take notice of this truly classic gem of modern motion picture art.",1013904000,3,887,4.411042944785276
674821,2,6303451535,"This strangest of 1960s epics from the David Lean stable is more correctly called an anti-epic - it has no vast battles; only a minor love interest; and a mostly interior focus.  There are no heroes, just opportunists, obsessives and dangerous madmen.  It aspires towards the compelling mundanity of the French policier - the central story is a murder mystery, and some of the personnel were involved in Melville's finest films - and has pertinent things to say about how the Allies compromised with Nazis after the war; but in the end the film is too fond of demonising the old sexually neurotic Nazi villain.  None of it works, and yet its oddly watchable in its way - perhaps because its indecision as to what it is makes it unpredictable; more probably, because you can watch Peter O'Toole giving a remote, cold, quietly mannered performance which still savours of the finest ham.",988243200,8,884,4.802631578947368
674822,4,6303451535,"I concur with the other reviews that give this film praise as a great murder-mystery.  The story is gripping, and the inter-play between war and post-war settings helps move things along.  More than most other World War II films, ""The Night of the Generals"" depicts German soldiers who really didn't like Hitler, but merely wanted to live and enjoy life.
I would characterize this film as a World War II film unlike any other that I have seen.  I especially liked Omar Sharif's character - a Nazi German military intelligence officer entranced with a Polish prostitute's murder in 1942 Warsaw.  Fast forward two years to 1944 Paris, and we find the same officer investigating a similar murder.  The very notion that such a crime would occupy this officer's time is comical, considering that the Allies are pushing to retake Paris and that he is supposed to be investigating a plot to kill Hitler.",986947200,2,896,4.830065359477124

674824,4,6303451535,"I think that this film is one of the best World War II films ever made.  It was the first film to show how Hitler's generals were opposed to him and his conduct of the war and how they conspired to eliminate him.  I don't  think that the film was depressing, lifeless or weak at all.  The  performances by the actors in the film were effective and convincing.  It  was a really great film.

675326,1,6303451535,"This movie has everything going for it except itself. Lots of talent to throw around, but somehow all thrown to the dustbin. And coming from the guys that made Lawrence of Arabia a few years before, it is almost unbelievable. None of it clicks: the story is absurd, the characters unconvincing, the love affair pointless, the score boring (I mean. its from Maurice Jarr&eacute;!), the ending preposterous, and the acting abysmal: Peter OToole, trying to play deranged, has never looked so ridiculous; Omar Shariff doesnt cut it as a German, no matter how blond the wig, and Donald Pleasance, for once, plays good guy against type -bad move. I wonder if the Shariff character was so dumb, deaf and blind as to not figure out the sort of regime he was serving, chasing after his superiors, believing Polish witnesses or making friends with the French R&eacute;sistance. What sort of police allow a man to borrow someone's gun after being arrested, or how come they bring Tom Courtenay back from nowhere, if not even his girlfriend knew where he was?

Not to mention the prudish restrictions of the time that age this film so badly: couples make love with their clothes on, people die bloodlessly when gunned down, etc.

Perhaps its only merit is that it was the first about the plot against Hitler. If so, better watch Valkyrie. Im not a fan of Tom Cruises acting abilities, but thats a much better movie.

My opinion, anyway.

P.S.: Back in the sixties, De Gaulle forbade any movie production to fly Nazi flags in Paris. Those used in Is Paris Burning were made gray instead of red, since that movie was shot in black and white. Strangely, you can see one of those flags displayed in this movie in the rear window from General Tanzs limo. Weird time capsule!",1442793600,6,1757,4.713355048859935

675459,4,6303451535,"Much derided on its initial release despite reuniting the Lawrence of Arabia team of Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif (who share little screen time) and producer Sam Spiegel, Anatole Litvak's The Night of the Generals is a different kind of epic failure, and much more interesting than many a success of its day.

Clumsily ripped off by the Vietnam movie Saigon/Off Limits, it's big-budget WW2 murder-mystery that goes off in all directions and frequently completely forgets its nominal main character, Omar Sharif's wildly miscast Nazi military policeman on the trail of the German general who brutally killed a Polish prostitute. In truth his part is little more than a cameo: he never does any detecting, merely occasionally getting information and a nice dinner from Philippe Noiret's French detective while the plot flashes forward to 1967 or off on a tangent with the plot to assassinate Hitler. The fact that so much screen time is devoted to unlikely Lothario Tom Courtney chauffeuring psychotic General Peter O'Toole around Paris doesn't exactly help the whodunit element, especially with his tendency to come over all epileptic every time he sees Vincent Van Gogh's self-portrait in the 'degenerate art' section of the Louvre.

Sharif isn't the only curious casting: it appears that the Wehrmacht did their recruiting almost exclusively at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, with their ranks swelled by cockney character players and their general staff by the better spoken staples of the British film industry. Somehow it just doesn't seem right to see John Gregson playing a Nazi...

The film is either too long or too short. As a mystery it needs to be tighter and more focused on the original investigation; as an epic exploration of Nazi opportunism, both during and after the war, it needs to be longer. As it stands, it does neither approach justice. But, sprawling and devoid of suspense that it is, the film still holds the interest, partially out of it's overly elaborate staging (there is one particularly impressive sequence of the razing of a Polish ghetto that highlights Henri Decae's use of color) and its over-reaching, misdirected ambition. And just when your attention is ready to stray it will throw in some interesting side-note or line of dialogue, such as Noiret's delicious response to Sharif's statement that one of their generals is a murderer: ""Only one?"" Sadly the raised question of morality being a simple question of scale - that while mass-murder is admirable in war, individual murder remains abhorrent - gets lost along the way.

The film had a rather spotty history on home video, with the barebones European DVD releases having no extras and dropping the playout music while the Asian bootleg versions had particularly poor quality. No such complaints with Twilight Time's limited edition (3000 copies) region-free Blu-ray release which features a stunning 2.35:1 widescreen restoration of the film that does justice to Decae's photography and respects his original colour scheme (not unsurprisingly dominated by field grey and an at times cold metallic look), including both the playout music and an isolated track for Maurice Jarre's score, the teaser and full trailers - both also remastered in their original ratio - and a booklet.",1435017600,3,3275,5.16195856873823

675547,5,6303451535,"This is a review of the movie firstly as well as the DVD quality.

I'll address the disc quality first and get that out of the way. I have owned a poor-to-middling quality transfer of this film in the past and this is most likely the release that other 1-star reviewers are talking about. Well, all I can say about the overall quality of the ""Combat Classics"" release of this film, is that it is the best digital transfer of this film I have seen. I'm not sure if there was a ""bad batch"" out there somewhere, but my copy works just fine with clear picture and sound throughout. In other words, I have no complaints at all regarding the quality of the film on disc. One additional quality note: my DVD player is a really good Sony that also plays Blu Ray discs, so maybe the player itself effects this?

Now on to the film itself!

""Night of the Generals"" is one of the best kept secrets in the film industry. Much like ""The Formula"" (starring George C. Scott & Marlon Brando -- PLEASE give that a viewing, as it too is a great and forgotten film), this film has a terrific cast that was chosen perfectly for its individual roles. I wouldn't hesitate to rank ""Night of the Generals"" right up there with films like ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" or ""Who's Afraid of Virginian Woolf"" and even ""Lion In Winter"" as one THE greatest, most effectively-cast films in history.

""Night of the Generals"" engages in a little revisionist history as it is a fictional tale woven into actual events within World War II from the nazi perspective. The film jumps into the plot immediately in occupied Warsaw, Poland, where a young woman is murdered and Polish tenant hiding in a  restroom witnesses the possible murderer walk past. The only problem is that this witness only sees part of the murderer's uniform -- the red stripe on the pant leg of a nazi general. From here, the talents of Omar Sharif (as Major Grau) take center stage. Grau's character develops for the viewer into what seems like an unshakable investigator bent on seeking justice... or is his ambition getting the better of him?

Grau's investigation quickly widens from the murder scene and places the top-3 nazi commanders in Poland in his crosshairs. All 3 are viable suspects and the script, direction and acting play this out beautifully. General von Seidlitz-Gabler -- played flawlessly aristocratic by Charles Gray -- is supreme commander of nazi forces around the as-yet-untamed Warsaw ghetto. Gabler's 2nd in command is General Kahlenberge -- played in a perfectly scheming way by Donald Pleasence. And that brings us to Hitler's man in Warsaw: SS General Tanz, played by the great Peter O'Toole. Of course, O'Toole's performance was his usual top-shelf, memorable self, but Pleasence Sharif and Gray also sunk their teeth beautifully into their respective roles.

As Grau's investigation is just putting the rubber to the road, he is temporarily delayed by the stoic Tanz who is in the midst of ""pacifying"" Warsaw with a show of force replete with strafing gunfire and flamethrowers. This is quite the epic scene and makes you truly appreciate the performance by O'Toole as well as Anatole Litvak's direction. But as Grau is about to accomplish a possible breakthrough, he is promoted and transferred to distant Paris. So, which General facilitated the transfer and was this done to throw Grau off the scent?

In Paris, the story continues with the addition to the plotline of Inspector Morand -- played elegantly by Philippe Noiret -- who assists the further efforts of Grau, who refuses to back off of his original findings. Also involved, is Corporal Hartmann -- played by Tom Courtenay -- whom General Kahlenberge enlists to spy on the recently transferred General Tanz. Also in Paris is General Gabler, the inclusion of whom spurs Grau's decision to continue his investigation. All of this takes place with the Valkyrie Plot brewing, which is why Kahlenberge enlisted the spy to watch and delay SS General Tanz from detecting Kahlenberge's involvement.

Cameo appearances by the intimidating Harry Andrews (as General Stulpnagel) and Christopher Plummer (as Field Marshal Rommel) add to an already-extraordinary cast and make the film that much more enjoyable.

Telling anymore of the plot would give far too much away, but rest assured, if you enjoy war films, you'll love this film. If you also enjoy murder mysteries, then ""Night of the Generals"" will become a sure favorite of your's. The film flips between flashbacks to current-day (which for the time was 1965) seamlessly and at no point does it confuse the viewer nor does it needlessly jumble or slow down the pace. In fact, it adds a degree of ""modern feel"" which (for viewers of this film who were not yet alive during WWII) effectively brings the uncomfortable knowledge of the post-war presence of nazis across the world's governments to the fore.",1431734400,6,4869,4.855421686746988

Donald Pleasance was on the other hand, quite convincing as a cynical and understandably nervous conspirator in the Von Stauffenberg plot to kill that crazy megalomaniac Adolf Hitler.

The sum total of the parts together just does not make a compelling package for the average viewer interested in entertainment.  However, there are several redeeming features for someone with specialized interests. The David Lean favourites - Omar Sharif, Tom Courtenay and Peter O'Toole - are together again, but seem stilted and unnatural, which is interesting as a comparison to their better efforts.  There are also lots of scenes filmed in 1960s Warsaw, which still looks like it did at the end of the war...in beautiful color, which is almost unknown in the historical record.  O'Toole is too young for this part and Sharif is unbelievable as a German, leaving Courtenay as the most worthwhile character.  The plot does not draw sympathy because it is based on a relatively minor crime taking place at the time of the Holocaust and other mayhem.

As it is, viewers must read between the lines or use their imaginations to fill out what seems to be missing.

676101,2,6303451535,"""The Night of the Generals"" boasts a superb cast, led by Peter O'Toole, but a shapeless story, mediocre dialogue, and poor direction leave the talented crew of actors very little to work with.

- The film fails as a thriller. An effective thriller must have a taught pace, wasting no time on irrelevancies. Instead, director Anatole Litvak sets the tempo of a barge floating down a river. The film wastes nearly a third of its length on meaningless details (such as landing, taxiing, and parking a passenger jet), or probing the depths of characters that are irrelevant to the plot.
- It's pretty lousy as a war movie, too. Other than filming some scenes in Warsaw--an admirable effort at authenticity--Litvak appears to lack either the budget or the attention-to-detail needed to capture truly the look and feel of the Nazis at war. Several good actors, such as Donald Pleasence, utterly fail to convince as German generals, and the battle scenes are generally laughable. Omar Sharif turns in the best performance in the film, but he was so badly miscast (as a German officer) that his effort is wasted. O'Toole struggles gamely to portray a high-functioning alcoholic/sadist/sociopath, but the character ends up merely bizarre, rather than compelling.
- Most crucially, the film just doesn't work as a drama. It really has no central character, and it muddies the motivations of all the principals.
- The technical aspects of the film are adequate, but uninspiring. Even Maurice Jarre, who wrote some of the most memorable movie scores of all time, turns in a hack performance here.

Some facts are incorrect...but hey....its a movie with some great old actors.  Glad I found the movie and watched it  - it kept my interest.  However some of OTooles acting is too theatrical for me - I was rolling my eyes at one point.  The other actors did a great job being real people.

676188,4,6303451535,"Several things come together in this movie that make it enjoyable for me: Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif working together again just a few years after making Lawrence of Arabia (1962), also Maurice Jarre's soundtrack (he did both Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago (1965), which Omarif Sharif starred in), also the presence of Tom Courtney, who co-starred in Doctor Zhivago. In addition, you have Donald Pleasance, who was in Great Escape (1963), another terrific movie from that period.
Lately I've been on a kick of watching WWII movies made in the '60's, kind of a mini genre. (Another interesting genre is WWII flicks actually made during the war--there are more of them than you might imagine.) Each decade brings its own perspective to the war; notably in the '60's there was sometimes a more irreverent attitude, as in The Dirty Dozen (1967), and more probing into the psychological depths, as in this flick from the same year.
In Night of the Generals you see the '60's preoccupation with psychology in full flower as Peter O'Toole plays the mad General. He draws on the same talent he displayed in Lawrence of Arabia for showing madness bubbling up from the depths; I'm sure that's why he was cast in this role.
A note of minor interest: this is the only other movie I've seen where Omar Sharif wears his hair as in Doctor Zhivago, although it is more closely cropped on the sides. I believe he is wearing a wig, his hairline having been shaved to make him look more European.",1386892800,,1487,4.723076923076923

a prostitute is ""slaughtered"" in Warsaw in 1942 and the witness sees a General Uniform as the ONLY clue to the crime.

676280,3,6303451535,"The Night of the Generals is a 1960s favorite of mine, even if it is just for the talent and the cinematography. Alas, today, because of a few production errors, as it stands this one is the answer to the trivia question ""What film reunited 'Lawrence of Arabia' co-stars Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif?""
This film has about every Sixties icon that could be shoved in a Wehrmacht uniform - Peter O'Toole, Tom Courtenay Omar Sharif, Charles Grey, Christopher Plummer, Donald Pleasance, Nigel Stock, etc. It only lacks Derren Nesbitt, Jeremy Kemp and James Mason (along with real German Karl Michael Vogler) to have rounded up the majority of European male stock of actors who could fill out a German uniform.
The setting of Warsaw showed these guys were bad Germans, and few movies are set in World War II Warsaw, even though it is as easy as taking a back lot and making it look further run down. Involving some of the Generals in the actual July 1944 plot to kill Hitler - hence the name ""The Night of the Generals"" - gives the film depth (but pads it for about half an hour). The ""who done it"" in wartime was a great plot touch. The color, the psychology used with O'Toole's character of General Tanz gives the movie a touch of learned discourse. And murdering prostitutes gave it as close to SEX, boobs and legs as could be done in 1966, when the film was lensed.
*** SPOILER *** And here's where it makes the viewer hate it: O'Toole literally kills the movie, the audience and Sharif's Major Grau when he guns down Omar in a climatic confrontation and with about 20 minutes left for dates and viewers to squirm their seats.
It was as if Holmes were torn apart by the Baskerville hounds on the moors.
Sharif as Grau was everyman. He is even likeable as a German pressed into wartime service because he was a policeman in civillian life and was needed for the war effort. Everybody loves the detective cop. But O'Toole simply, dispassionately guns him down. It is a cheap shock for the audience, but the act destroys the one person the viewer identified with. I mean there may have been a few fellows in 1967 Rio or Caracas who were pulling for the Generals, but those guys were not the money paying target audience.
Spend two hours building a character and then gun him down, and the audience will hate the movie. They did, and they still do.
Well, a guy who was an enlisted man in 1967 Vietnam said they showed this movie to the soldiers and it was sort of popular for the girls,the sex killing and the fact a few generals sort of get it.
This could be remade today. Throw out the bit about killing Hitler, make it a straight psycho general with common hang ups and keep Grau ALIVE until after the war when he brings justice to Tanz, and it would work. It could even work with some sort of anti moral twist ending, such as Grau killing Tanz and keeping the cycle of violence open. But it CANNOT work with the hero figure murdered before the closing act.
So, great film if you like 1960s talent and faux psychology. If you like straight murder mysteries or simple crime plots - SKIP IT.",1373155200,,3087,4.455830388692579

676381,1,6303451535,"Rarely is the gap between a good idea and the finished movie so enormous as it is with Night of the Generals, which is pretty much a shambles from start to finish. The film opens in Nazi-occupied Warsaw, in December 1942, when an anonymous general is accidentally spotted after he's foully murdered a prostitute. Omar Sharif is hopelessly miscast as a truth-seeking German colonel on the trail of the killer. There are three suspects: a general with a hectoring wife, a quiet nervous general, and Peter O'Toole as General Tanz, a psychotic neat freak whose idea of fun is to set fire to a city block with flamethrowers and then have heavy tanks blow up the remaining buildings (historical note: there were in fact no Tiger tanks in Warsaw in December 1942). Now remember, this is supposed to be a mystery. So who might the guilty man be: General Henpecked, General Nervous, or General Completely Freaking Insane? I know who my money is on, even at this early stage. Just as Sharif is getting somewhere he is mysteriously transferred to Paris and oddly accepts the posting, rather than sticking it out and tracking down the murderer.

The film, which has a distressing habit of flicking forward to the 1960s for no obvious reason, then switches to July 1944, when Generals Henpecked and Nervous are in Paris and learn to their distress that Crazy Man Tanz is also about to arrive. Tanz, supposedly a teetotaller, drinks like a fish in the back seat of his car as he tours Paris and pays not one but two visits to an art gallery where he seems curiously obsessed by a Van Gogh self-portrait showing the painter in obviously deranged mood. Tanz is unable to control himself when he sees this work and has a mini-collapse each time. Later he looks at himself in the mirror, adopts the same crazed look as Van Gogh did, and then breaks the glass. So, are there any doubts who the killer is? In fact there aren't, because he picks up a French prostitute, butchers her, and pins the blame on his driver.

At this point you're wondering what on earth the point of the film is and where the mystery might be. But wait, there's more! General Nervous is a ring-leader of the plot to assassinate Hitler and presses General Henpecked to join the gang. At this moment the film loses all sense of direction or coherence and turns into a pastiche comedy like The Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines, an overlong big budget talent-studded farce that came out two years earlier in 1965. For no apparent reason we lurch deep into Operation Valkyrie, the plot to kill Hitler, and watch as a bomb fails to blow up the dictator in his bunker. The plotters in Paris move to arrest various pro-Fuhrer elements and send off a column to apprehend Tanz. Sharif, who has been unwisely fraternising with the French resistance, knew of the plan to kill Hitler but did nothing. When he learns of Tanz's imminent arrest, though, he jumps in his jeep, easily overtakes the column (which for all the urgency it's showing might as well be a brass band out on its annual picnic), and confronts Tanz with the accusation that he is the killer.

Sadly, there is quite a bit more. The film continues and ends quite ridiculously. O'Toole gives one of his worst performances and must surely have been in it for the money, Sharif hasn't a hope with his part and accomplished actors such as Tom Courtenay and Donald Pleasance (and others) are totally wasted. This is a lazy film with a truly horrible script and utterly inept direction. I'm glad I had the flu when I watched it because otherwise I would rather have resented the two and a half hours it ate up.",1359849600,6,3621,4.610852713178295

The Columbia Combat Classic is a modestly priced and very good transfer.  The 1967 film was a Sam Spiegel production, the man responsible for bringing us ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and here he reunites those two stars of ""Lawrence"", Peter O'Toole and Omar Shariff.  It is directed by veteran Anatole Litvak and sports a great score by Maurice Jarre and well photographed by Henri Decae.  Written by Joseph Kessel and Paul Dehn from a novel by Hans Helmut Kirst.  It is one of my favorite movies on the holocaust of World War II, a rather brief list so far, that includes John Frankenheimer's ""The Train"", Sophia Loren in ""Two Women"" and ""Judith"" (not available on home video yet) and the grandaddy, Stanley Kramer's ""Judgment at Nuremberg.""  ""Night of the Generals"" is rather long, but an expensive production that also features extraordinary performances by Tom Courtenay, Joanna Pettet, Coral Browne, Donald Pleasence and Christopher Plummer.  The money is well spent.  It pays extraordinary attention to detail with production designed by Alexander Trauner.  Some reviewers site that Peter O'Toole is miscast, but I think on the contrary that it is an effective, startling performance that brings the necessary menace to the Third Reich that historians have hinted may indeed lie behind some of Hitler's psyche.  Although the whodunnit is more or less revealed early on, the actual murders committed are so monstrous they are never shown but only seen by the reaction to people who view the crime scenes.

676440,4,6303451535,"Night Of The Generals is almost a great film. If it seems a bit disappointing it's because it never quite lives up to its tantalizing potential.
On the surface it's a murder mystery that takes place during World War II, weaving together two seemingly unrelated stories that meander through a meticulously rendered landscape of Nazi-occupied Europe. One story concerns the murder of a prostitute, the other the attempted assassination of Hitler by a group of generals. Both storylines are tied together by a third storyline set years after the war. The mystery itself is fairly predictable and really quite unimportant; a mere structural device for the central theme: the importance of one death in the midst of countless deaths; one individual crime set against the backdrop of the gigantic and monstrous crime of war.
There are a few memorable scenes, such as Peter O'Toole, resplendent in Nazi regalia, standing commandingly in a big black Mercedes convertible while behind him German tanks and flame throwers methodically destroy the city of Warsaw.
Peter O'Toole is effective as a psychopathic Nazi General who blithely rationalizes war and murder. Omar Sharif is the German investigator turning over rocks to find the killer. It is an ambitious film that tries to cover too much territory, making it somewhat uneven, but nevertheless worth watching. In the end it works well enough, but one can only wonder what it would have been in the hands of a more capable director.",1341619200,,1476,5.078189300411522
676441,4,6303451535,"This is an excellent movie that in my opinion just misses five-star status.  The best part of this film is the stellar cast, led by Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif, but also featuring Donald Pleasance and others.  The film involves a murder of a prostitute in Nazi-occupied Warsaw.  Omar Sharif is a Nazi criminal investigator who is nonetheless a man of integrity, and he becomes obsessed with bringing the murderer to justice.  The problem is that the one thing known about the murderer is that he is a German General, of whom there are three who fall under suspicion.

Peter O'Toole plays General Tanz, one of the three Generals under suspicion.  O'Toole plays the part with his usual superb talent.  General Tanz is a vicious Nazi fanatic and an ascetic, fastidious man who does not consort with prostitutes.  So who is the killer?  All of this takes place against the backdrop of the great events of the war.  More would be telling but I think that almost everyone who enjoys war films will enjoy this movie.  I certainly did.  The cinematography is superb, and the viewer feels transported to Nazi-occupied Europe at its peak.

The one thing that I did not like about this film was the musical score.  It is lighthearted and inappropriate for the subject matter in this film; at least that is how it seemed to me.

676445,4,6303451535,"This is one of those movies that is an assemblage of perfect scenes written beautifully and performed magnificently, based upon a very excellent novel, which somehow fail to work when put together.  I think the filmmakers hoped to reproduce the success of Dr. Zhivago and Lawrence of Arabia by reassembling many of the best elements of those films, without David Lean directing.  That is probably where the film fails, but it still is a very worthwhile effort.  Peter O'Toole, Donald Pleasance, Omar Sharriff, Tom Courtney, Charles Gray - the list of wonderful actors who give wonderful performances goes on and on.  The music by Maurice Jarre is excellent and appropriate, and the staging and cinematography is worthy of the cast.  Each scene by itself is nearly perfect, but I think the film ultimately fails because its grandiosity somehow misses the subtlety of the story.  The story, which is grandiose in conception actually is very small in action, albeit told against the grandiose backdrop of the war.  The question posed by the story is put beautifully by the script:  ""Murder is the profession of generals, is it not?  Well, if we must give medals to mass murderers, let us try to give justice to the small entrepreneur.""

This film is well worth having just for the number of great quotes in the script, and the fine performances.  Although it fails to be the great film it so badly wanted to be, it is by no means a bad film.  In fact it is a good film.

676446,4,6303451535,"Despite what the cover art on the DVD box might indicate, this is not an action movie about WW II. This is a murder mystery set in Warsaw and Paris about a Nazi general with a fondness for butchering prostitutes. The film begins with the discovery of a dead prostitute in Warsaw, and the investigation is handled by Grau, a major in German intelligence. He learns from an eyewitness that the man seen leaving the dead woman's flat was wearing the uniform of a German general. Grau, played by Omar Sharif, learns that there were only three generals in Warsaw that night who do not have an alibi: Generals Kahlenberg, Gabler and Tanz. The generals are played by, respectively, Donald Pleasance, Charles Gray and Peter O'Toole.

Grau attempts to question the generals but is rebuffed, and then finds himself transferred to Paris. The story picks up two years later with the Allies about to enter the city and the three generals all, once again, in the same city. In truth, the film doesn't offer much of a murder mystery. It's patently obvious from the beginning that the Peter O'Toole character is the killer, and Grau does little of what could be called investigative work.

What makes this film entertaining is the cast, which, with the exception of Sharif, is all-British. This seems to have produced a healthy spirit of competition amongst them because they don't stint on trying to upstage each other. Pleasance does a fine job of combining acerbic wit and humanity, and Charles Gray, who made a career out of playing upper-class weasels, gives us a weasel with knobs on and oak leaf clusters. But the star attraction here is O'Toole, who goes over the top and around the bend as a Nazi madman. Tanz isn't just a serial killer, he's also a kleptomaniac, an alcoholic, and obsessive-compulsive. The highlight of the film, from a thespian point of view, is when Tanz stands before one of Van Gogh's more disturbed self-portraits. O'Toole/Tanz goes through a brief, but epic, nervous breakdown that the director must have enjoyed so much he has Tanz revisit the portrait the next day to have another freakout. As a demented killer, O'Toole's Tanz is right up there with Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter; both performances are hammy, but in both cases it's Grade A artisanal ham.

The script might not offer us much of a mystery, but it is intelligently written and there is lots of crisp, witty dialogue for the Brits to tuck into. The novel the film was based on is by H.H. Kirst, and I definitely want to check him out.

I waited but no good dvd release so I finally downloaded my first
movie ever and it's was so easy and the quality is great! So if u
don't like the dvd quality download this now. The movie is a mix of
war nazi thriller with mystery psycho movie. It's very well made and
written. The direction & pace of movie is great even for a 2 1/2 hour
movie I could not stop watching. Peter O'Toole is incredlbe as the
blood thirsty general with some strange habits. Omar Sharif if very
good and cool as the investigator. Donald Pleasance starts out as the
most nazi looking one but turns out not to be. Very good ending and
suspense. It also quietly has a 2nd plot with the Valkyrie story. It's
the main focus as you're more involved in the murder part of story but
it adds a good bonus and makes this one of the best nazi war movies ever!

676643,4,6303451535,"It's 1942 German occupied Poland. Abwehr officer Major Grau (Omar Sharif) is called by the Warsaw police to the murder scene of a prostitute. When Major Grau arrives at the gruesome scene in a run-down tenement, he asks the Polish police detective in charge why the murder of a prostitute should require German assistance. The Polish detective informs Grau that the prostitute was an agent for the Germans, therefore the incident was a matter for German military intelligence.

While interrogating the residents of the tenement, Grau learns from one terrified resident that he saw the murderer. That is, he saw the German military pants the murderer wore from a hole in the door of the lavatory he was in as the murderer came down the steps, and that the pants had a red stripe running down the legs.

The terrified witness has implicated a German general officer with murder!

So begins Grau's investigation into the murder of a Warsaw prostitute, the war be damned. Grau's philosophy is, since generals are in the business of mass murder, then justice should be upheld for the small-time entrepreneur.

Read The Following Only If You Purchased/Rented The January 29, 2007 'The Castaways Pictures' DVD Release Of The Movie:

Many reviewers complain about the DVD's picture quality. This DVD is from China and is really designed for High Definition televisions, otherwise night scenes have noticeable distortions. The other common complaint of a blurred picture is easily solved (for both High Definition and Analog televisions) by tuning the picture Sharpness to its maximum level.

So, if you have a High Definition Television, tune the picture Sharpness to its maximum level. Now you're all set! If you have an Analog television set, also tune the picture Sharpness to its maximum level AND adjust the Brightness level to approximately mid-level, or somewhere in that range until you are satisfied that the night scenes' distortions mentioned above no longer show. Now you're all set too!

When the above picture adjustments are made, the DVD picture sports a robust DVD transfer.

It should be noted that the aspect ratio is Widescreen Anamorphic 1.78:1, not Fullscreen 1.33:1 as advertised by Amazon.",1298332800,2,2205,5.105555555555555

676742,5,6303451535,"The WWII based story line centers on the hunt for someone who has violently murdered several prostitutes in various locales.  The modus-operandi is the same in each killing.

However, unlike the in-your-face style gratuitous violence and sex of the Eastwood film, the O'Toole film is a suspenseful and intricate plot, with surprises and twists of fortune that just keep coming right up until the final scene.  Maybe I can relate better to this usage, where the violence and twisted sexuality are handily inserted into the context of war.  Monstrosity enveloped by monstrosity, neatly spaced at a comfortable distance.

The blood isn't veritably spattering off of the screen at us.  But the principle of not excluding anyone from the entitlement to justice, even a prostitute, or for that matter not elevating anyone above the dessert of justice, even a general, it has a satisfying conclusion.

I choose the VHS title of this film for low price and because some customers thought the DVD version suffered from poor copy quality instead of being re-mastered.  I'm not disappointed.

676747,2,6303451535,"THE NIGHT OF THE GENERALS is an interesting World War Two detective story saddled with an implausible plot.  Despite diverse location filming in Warsaw, Hamburg, and Paris, this film saunters along on the premise that anyone cares about two murders, and later a third, in a world at war.

The plot:  A prostitute is brutally murdered in German occupied Warsaw.  The story would end there except that the woman was a German agent, and a witness spotted the red striped trousers of a German general officer descending the stairs afterward.  A German army major (Omar Sharif) is appointed to investigate.  He quickly narrows the suspects to three army generals Tanz (Peter O'Toole), Kahlenberge (Donald Pleasence) and von Seidlitz-Gabler (Charles Gray).  Each of the general officers has something to hide and are visibly uncomfortable with Grau.  The war marches on and the investigation is overcome by events.  Fate reunites all the key players together in 1944 Paris.  There another girl is murdered and Colonel Grau renews his investigation with Tanz as the chief suspect.  Grau's investigation is further complicated by the chaos reigning in the immediate aftermath of the unsuccessful July 20th attempt to kill Hitler.  The movie then jumps forward 20 years to 1965 when a German prostitute is murdered.  Interpol Inspector Morand picks up the investigation where Grau left off in 1944.

There are some great actors in this film.  The story just does not hold up.  Had all these events unfolded in 1944 Paris the story might have been more believable.  However, it is difficult to believe that the German military would afford any effort to investigate the two murders.  Peter O'Toole is known for his eccentric characters.  His portrayal of Tanz is no different.  Tanz is a bad stereotype of an obsessive compulsive aristocrat.  It is even more difficult to believe that a wartime senior Heer (army) general would suddenly become a Waffen SS General.  Transfers like this were more common in the early days of the SS, but not in wartime.

NIGHT OF THE GENERALS also twists history.  The murder and initial investigation takes place in 1942.  At that point we find Tanz commanding a force dedicated to razing a part of Warsaw, yet the Warsaw Ghetto uprising took place in 1943 and the general uprising was in 1944.  The timeline is better represented when the action takes place in 1944 Paris.

This was the first time since LAWRENCE OF ARABIA that O'Toole and Sharif appeared in film together.  Sharif was believable as a Russian in DR. ZHIVAGO, but I just did not buy his portrayal as a German in NIGHT OF THE GENERALS.  It is possible that his reunion with O'Toole made him appear as the Arabian Sherif Ali character from LAWRENCE.  By the way, Tom Courtenay, who played the framed Corporal Hartmann in NIGHT OF THE GENERALS, also had a strong supporting role in DR. ZHIVAGO.  You might also recognize him from 1965's OPERATION CROSSBOW.

Both Donald Pleasence and Charles Gray were better James Bond villains as Ernst Stavros Blofeld, in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER respectively, than they were German generals.  In yet another link to LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, Charles Gray, whose voice sounds very much like Jack Hawkins, was called upon to dub some of Hawkins lines in the 1989 re-release of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA.

Also look for a brief appearance by veteran actor Christopher Plummer in the role of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel.

NIGHT OF THE GENERALS film was not helped by Maurice Jarre's soundtrack.  Almost everything Jarre has done since LAWRENCE OF ARABIA sounds like LAWRENCE OF ARABIA.  Remember the similar soundtrack from THE TRAIN?  It was not until the late 1970s that Jarre finally set aside the familiar LAWRENCE musical cues.

NIGHT OF THE GENERALS was released in 1967, a year that boasted only three major World War Two movie releases.  No doubt NIGHT OF THE GENERALS was overshadowed by THE DIRTY DOZEN.  Even Rock Hudson's TOBRUK garnered more positive comments.

I had fond memories of this film as a kid.  A couple times a year WABC, the local ABC station in the New York area, would air a week's worth of war movies as its weekday afternoon movie.  NIGHT OF THE GENERALS was one of those films that was always shown in two parts.  Back then I was more interested in the brief battle scenes, specifically the German tanks firing on buildings in Warsaw, than the detective story.  Many years later I eagerly added the film to my collection because of those memories.  In all honesty, this film is painful to watch.  If you are viewing the film and have to leave the room for a few minutes, do not even bother to pause the DVD.  You will not have missed anything.",1253059200,2,4700,4.836888331242158

As for the movie itself, it's in color, letterbox format, and it's just spectacular! It's a combination of two film genres, mixing a WW II film with a murder mystery -- and the scenes, setting, scenery, casting, special effects, storyline, soundtrack, and cinematography are all spot-on, terrific!

The story is about a Nazi officer (a really ethical guy!) who is assigned to investigate (like a regular policeman) the murder of a prostitute and to bring the perpetrator to justice. He soon discovers that very similar depraved murders have occurred in the past and, due to one terrified witness glimpsing the red stripe down a uniform trouser leg, a uniform feature which was exclusive to Nazi generals, the investigator knows that this will definitely be a difficult case to resolve.

He soon narrows the suspect generals down to three men, all of whom had both the bad temperment as well as the opportunity to kill and mutilate these women. But soon, most of the focus begins to center on one VERY strange general in particular (one of the three). All this takes place during an aggressive and brutal Nazi purge of ""dissidents"" in the town and that is the war side of the film. There's a lot more to the story, sub-plots, etc., but I don't want to convey any spoilers.

676881,5,6303451535,"I don't think it possible to think of this movie as either a period piece or a re-hash of the ""hate the Nazi"" World War Two screen novel.  It goes way beyond that.  I believe that Peter O'Toole is at the peak of his talent in this film.  I only know of one actor who was gifted at portraying men who were homicidally/mentally ill and that was Humphrey Bogart in the ""Caine Mutiny"" and ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"".
O'Toole is so good in this part that all of the other actors in the movie have to come up to his level and that makes it one of the better acted plays of the latter part of the 20th Century.
Charles Gray and Coral Browne play the typical man and wife team out to make it to the top of whatever organization they work and play in.  The way they play off the Hitler loving O'Toole with their ""loyalty statements to Uncle Adolf"" is only as remarkable as their attempt to pawn off their daughter (Joanna Pettet) to this SS monster, without once reverting to the tried and true ""Heil Hitlers"".
Even the bit actors come onto the scene with credible performances, such as Nigel Stock who rushes into an office to find that O'Toole's character has murdered Omar Sharif and after an `eye opening' expression on his face suddenly accepts the fact that his boss has just committed another murder, then dutifully and unquestioningly carries the body outside in the foray!
The interaction between Donald Pleasence and Tom Courtenay seemed strange at first, and was probably bordering on homosexual.  Though at the time that would have been hard to swallow at Columbia Pictures, never-the-less it was in the movie.  Perhaps an acknowledgment that this film by Sam Spiegel was produced in Europe.
All of this great script writing, superlative acting, and excellent photography combined with great location shots are all surrounded by probably one of the best adapted music scores in motion picture history.  Academy Award winner Maurice Jarre who wrote the score also did all of the David Lean Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago scores.
When you see O'Toole's face when he sneaks in to look at art declared illegal by the Third Reich to look at Van Gogh's impressionist self portrait painting, minus the artist's ear, you get the message loud and clear:  Hang on to your seat while watching this movie because you are about to take a psycho roller coaster ride into madness!",1184544000,3,2379,4.6610978520286395
676882,4,6303451535,"This  movie is one that  should be seen after reading the Hans Helmut  Kirst novel on which it is  based. The  novel  goes into depth on the  three different types of  generals portrayed and how each type of  general  betrayed the country by serving  Hitler. The old monocled Prussian aristocrat, the middle class techician played by Donald Pleasance and of  course the incomparable O'Toole as the Nazi fanatic. The novel is less a whodunnit than historical ruminations with the murder as a backdrop. I think many of  the best  things in the novel don't make it into the movie, while  many ridiculous bits of  dialogue do.

  The end of the novel is  particularly ironic because  Tans the former  National Socialist fanatic ends up  working for the East German communists, not  celebrating the old days at  a ridiculous reunion.

  I enjoy O'Toole immensely,but  agree that Sharif's  character is not  credible.",1166313600,4,911,4.912751677852349
676883,5,6303451535,"I liked this film as a teenage and was glad to have it on DVD, although I seem to have the one quality disc. It did not have chapter headings or a commentary, but I feel pleased to find it on DVD..my VHS tape was not so good.

 The film has a cast of experienced, mainly British stage and film actors. The spoken language is crisp and formal, but  seems to go with the immaculate uniforms. The film is shot on location: Paris, Berlin (I think)...and  Warsaw, not a bad achievement for 1965, seeing that Poland was behind the iron curtain.

""Generals"" unites Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif soon after their ""Lawrence of Arabia"" success....but this film was soon forgotten... it's a one off for Omar Sharif, though...see if you can spot what I mean!

The rhetorical question for the producers is - is one death important during a war ""where bodies lay in the streets like cobble stones?"" You,decide on the morality...I've made up my mind.

The film traces the murder of three prostitues, one in Warsaw, one in Paris and one in Hamburg. Omar Sharif  plays the German Major determined to find the Killer - who is one of three generals. Sharif joins forces with a French civilian police inspector and althought they are wartime enemies they form a bond of respect and the story is actually told from the point of view of the Frenchman for a reason I can't reveal because of a spoiler.

Peter O'Toole seemed to make a career in the 1960s playing half-mad leading characters, Lawerence, Lord Jim and see what you think General Tanz. The love scenes and romatic dialogue between a young Tom Courtney and Joanna Pettet are a little too stilted, but they're only a subplot afterall.

The film has an interesting style of voice-over and flashback to link action that has not grown stale in the passing decades. The film is good for its measured pace...no continous tank and machinegun shoot ups to keep today's 13-19 year olds happy. It's a good piece of ""tail-end"" hollywood studio era type filmmaking and worth a look.",1160352000,,2008,4.630985915492958
676884,3,6303451535,"Much derided on its initial release despite reuniting the Lawrence of Arabia team of Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif (who share little screen time) and producer Sam Spiegel, Anatole Litvak's The Night of the Generals is a different kind of epic failure, and much more interesting than many a success of its day.

Clumsily ripped off by the Vietnam movie Saigon/Off Limits, it's big-budget WW2 murder-mystery that goes off in all directions and frequently completely forgets its nominal main character, Omar Sharif's wildly miscast Nazi military policeman on the trail of the German general who brutally killed a Polish prostitute. In truth his part is little more than a cameo: he never does any detecting, merely occasionally getting information and a nice dinner from Philippe Noiret's French detective while the plot flashes forward to 1967 or off on a tangent with the plot to assassinate Hitler. The fact that so much screen time is devoted to unlikely Lothario Tom Courtney chauffeuring psychotic General Peter O'Toole around Paris doesn't exactly help the whodunit element, especially with his tendency to come over all epileptic every time he sees Vincent Van Gogh's self-portrait in the 'degenerate art' section of the Louvre.

Sharif isn't the only curious casting: it appears that the Wehrmacht did their recruiting almost exclusively at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, with their ranks swelled by cockney character players and their general staff by the better spoken staples of the British film industry. Somehow it just doesn't seem right to see John Gregson playing a Nazi...

The film is either too long or too short. As a mystery it needs to be tighter and more focused on the original investigation; as an epic exploration of Nazi opportunism, both during and after the war, it needs to be longer. As it stands, it does neither approach justice. But, sprawling and devoid of suspense that it is, the film still holds the interest, partially out of it's overly elaborate staging (there is one particularly impressive sequence of the razing of a Polish ghetto that highlights Henri Decae's use of color) and it's over-reaching, misdirected ambition. And just when your attention is ready to stray it will throw in some interesting side-note or line of dialogue, such as Noiret's delicious response to Sharif's statement that one of their generals is a murderer: ""Only one?"" Sadly the raised question of morality being a simple question of scale - that while mass-murder is admirable in war, individual murder remains abhorrent - gets lost along the way.

No extras, but, unlike the substandard Asian release, the 2.35:1 transfer on the PAL European release does justice to Decae's photography.",1153267200,,2707,5.1315192743764175
676885,4,6303451535,"Nazi genre thrillers are tough to transfer to the screen, but this one is first rate, in spite of its extreme length and (in hindsight) distinctly 1960s costuming, cinematography, direction and soundtrack.

Implausibilities aside, it is a diverting and interesting crime adventure cleverly using both Nazi occupied Poland and France, as well as contemporary European settings, to tell its story.  Peter O'Toole, Tom Courtenay, Donald Pleasance and Coral Browne are especially noteworthy in their roles.",1126310400,6,502,5.68

It is definately for the officianado who appreciates period dramas and the detail and perfection in which English acting brings to the genre.  For instance, O'toole is amazing as a sadistic Nazi gereral.  Omar Sharif is excellent, still his looks do make it hard to believe he is a German Army Major and not a concentration camp victim.  The plot is excellently played out over a series of 20 years and a serial murder case which pursues three Nazi gererals from occupied Poland, to Paris just before D-Day and post war Germany.",1048377600,11,578,4.75
676887,1,6303451535,"Director Anatole Litvack, who struck gold with Sorry Wrong Number laid an ostrich sized egg with Night of the Generals despite a talented cast.
This lengthy and boring snoozer of a flick surrounds the investigation of Omar Sharif playing a Nazi intelligence officer of a brutal murder of a Polish prostitute in wartorn 1942 Warsaw.  An eyewitness though unable to see the face of the murderer recognized that his uniform was that of a German general.  The only generals without alibis were the psychotic warhawk Peter O'Toole, the timid Charles Gray and the devious and plotting Donald Pleasance.  Lacking cooperation, Sharif has no chance of solving the crime.
The scene shifts to 1944 Paris where again a prostitute is butchered. Sharif with the help of French investigator and Resistance member Phillippe Noiret suspect O'Toole but cannot prove his guilt.
The movie fast forwards to 1965 (the present) where a reunion of the cast finally unlocks the mystery of the serial killing.
Considering the material with which to work, the director did an awful job with what could have been an intriguing plot.  The backround music was suggestive of a comedy and highly inappropriate.  Maybe it's just me but Nazi generals with British accents doesn't cut it.  Don't waste your time like I did.",1039478400,10,1288,5.023474178403756
676888,4,6303451535,"I have been recommending ""The Night of the Generals"" to friends for years.  Although strictly speaking it is a murder mystery, it contains so many other elements that make this a very entertaining movie.
Take away all of the successful surface elements - the amazing cast, the historical backdrop, the many tensions of flawed leaders at war, etc. - and you still have a story that has a lot of important things to say.  Every character is magnificent as they try to wrangle with murder, war, justice, love, fear, heroism, brutality, family, and other matters.  This seems like a lot - and it is - but the acting and the script combine to make it work.
What tends to turn people off is that admittedly the large infusion of supporting characters and subplots can make this film a little confusing and strange.  Peter O'Toole's character in particular is as cold and stiff as a corpse in a Russian winter.  Omar Sharif's passion for solving the crime is at times over the top.  But it is precisely each strong personality that makes each character compelling and vulnerable.  The other perceived drawback is that 1960s WWII dramas tend to be somewhat campy.  There are parts with very poor dubbing (from primarily the foreign extras).  Also, the fact that most of the characters - including nearly every Nazi - have British accents has always made me laugh.  One just has to get past those oddities and pay attention to the script/story.
Probably the best compliment is that it simply doesn't matter if you know who the murderer is.  All of the other intrigue still makes this a fantastic movie.",1034899200,32,1593,4.7355072463768115
676889,5,6303451535,"This movie is excellent from the beginning to the end. For once, German officers were portrayed in an acceptable way. They are not the robot machines as they are usually shown. Although, in the beginning you seem to see that typical old picture of the cold blooded Nazi-beast. But the more the film develops the more you find out that behind those ""strong"" characters stand people like you and me. People who have doubts. People who have weaknesses. This is exactly the strength of the movie. Why? Because the more the character unfolds the more you become intrigued by it.
Obviously, General Tanz is a little bit of a carricature. This exaggeration of his character is however used deliberately to come to a surprising end.
The cast is absolutely stunning and every single one of them deserves five stars. Especially Peter O'Toole plays it very well.
I would say, anyone who is interested in murder cases connected with a film on Nazi Germany and the Second World War should get it.
