He was a hero in Vietnam, and a hero to me in everything he did.  The transaction went quickly, and so I purchased a second copy for my sister.  Thank you so much!",1338163200,,329,3.8358208955223883

The Vietnam Veterans Memorial was founded by Jan Scruggs, an infantry corporal who served in Vietnam from 1969-1970. He wanted to create a memorial that would acknowledge and recognize the service and sacrifice of all the men and women who had served in Vietnam. After raising the necessary funds, The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund held a national design competition.

The winning entry was created by Maya Ying Lin. She envisioned black granite walls that would provide a mirror-like surface to reflect the surrounding images. Her vision was met with cynicism and opposition to the point that the project nearly halted, taking three and half years to finish.

This film takes a look back at the huge impact this memorial has had on the American people. It is now Washington D.C.'s most visited monument, drawing millions of visitors each year. There are a total of 58,260 names listed, including approximately 1,200 missing persons. This film is very well done, providing a fascinating look at the history of The Wall, as well as sharing some of the stories of the veterans who served our country.

Struggling to find a good gift for that hard-to-buy-for person in your life? In addition to this video, Smithsonian Networks offers out some of the very best and most intriguing programs.",1231891200,4,1484,4.971774193548387
