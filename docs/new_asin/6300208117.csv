222859,3,6300208117,"An assorted group of people are waiting in Christian Flats for the stage to take them to Laramie. Once the empty stage arrives it's evident that it has been the victim of a Cheyenne attack, but out of need and bravery, the hardy souls decide to risk the journey regardless........

Very much a minor Western in the grand scheme of the 1950s offerings, Dakota Incident makes up for what it lacks in quality, by being an oddly structured film of intrigue. The actual ""incident"" of the film isn't until about the half way point, because prior to the inevitable Cheyenne attack, there is no shortage of character forming. In fact this might be the longest prologue in Western history! Basically crooked John Banner (Dale Robertson) is shot and apparently left for dead out in the hills by his two so called allies. Getting to the town he proceeds to annoy everyone with his oafishness and of course catch up with the two who wronged him. In amongst all this we are also following the interests of the few who will eventually make up the stage passengers. With sultry Amy Clarke {Linda Darnell}, John Carter {John Lund}, Regis Toomey's Minstrel and Senator Blakely {Ward Bond} being the main principals. All of whom have back stories as to why they are making this decidedly perilous trip.

It's very good stuff for its first half, in fact I tip my hat off to the makers for really giving the characters some substance. Yes we may not like them really, but at least our attention is held and as they board the stage, we are intrigued as to how things will pan out for them. The second half tho is a mixed bag, the action sequences are poorly put together but are off set a touch by the nice locale work at Red Rock Canyon State Park. While using the ""Trucolor"" technique really adds a vivid look to the action. None more so than the sight of the vivacious and curvy Darnell, resplendent in bright red dress, firing away at the Cheyenne with her newly acquired rifle. Dale Robertson and John Lund are average at best, but again it's not hurting the film too much because Darnell, Bond and Toomey are holding their ends up. The ending is perhaps a bit twee for some tastes, but it does work and closes the picture on a competent note.

Republic Pictures have done far better films than this, and this one is a tough picture to recommend to even the hardiest of Western fans. But it's got a beguiling factor, and an oddity that means it's definitely one to at least try to see if the chance should arise.

A cautious 6/10 from me.",1313539200,4,2522,4.5
222860,3,6300208117,"Most  movie guides -general and specialist-give this movie a bad rep. It is frequently dismissed as ""Stagecoach"" lite-a variation on stage passengers under attack from marauding Indians .Yes there are similarities and yes this is inferior to John Ford's groundbreaking 1939 masterpiece,but it does not merit the opprobrium heaped upon it by critics .

It is a movie of two halves .It opens when John Banner (Dale Robertson)is shot and left for dead by his two partners in a bank robbery. He is not in fact dead and makes his way on foot to a nearby town wherre he settles accounts with the backshooting pair .A motley group is assembled in town awaiting the arrival of the Laramie stage .The noisiest is a US Senator (Ward Bond)a moralising sententious bore who maunders on at great length about the need to adopt a more liberal policy towards Indians rathet than agree with the majority sentiment that wants troops despatched to the region .There is a glamourous entertainer (Linda Darnell)and her accompanist (Regis Toomey),not to mention Hamilton(John Lund)who seems to have an unusually deep interest in Banner ,to the extent of watching him like a hawk.
Despite the arrival of the stage showing evidence of an Indian attack the group sets out by  stage only to lose a wheel and have the horses bolt .They come under siege and are  trapped in a dried out stream bed  .Their Indian adversaries alternately try full on assault and starvation/thirst to destroy the group which is gradually whittled down to just 2 survivors .

The final message is one of redemption and hope .The script is over wordy at times but the compensations are many -good colour photography by Ernest Haller,whose lighting skills saw him garner an Oscar for Gone With the Wind and whose work here shows the usually lacklustre Trucolor process at its best ,and a raft of better than average performances from a good cast. The action is well staged and this is a better than average B-Western",1197417600,10,1966,4.836309523809524

222910,1,6300208117,"Didn't like it at all.  Silly propaganda about living in peace with the Indians.  Message in this movie is that Indians, not whites wanted war, and there could be peace if only the Indians want it.  Sure there can be peace if the Indians only give up their land!  Portends the superiority of white man - Indians are terrible shots, whites always hit the Indians, but Indians miss.  Whites win all the one on one hand fights. Indians are treacherous, shoot an unarmed man,  etc. The reality was peace was always on the white man's terms - terms which the white men always violated themselves.  Used to be a great museum in Wall, South Dakota about 70-80 miles from the Wounded Knee cemetery.  Go there and see the real history of white-Indian relations in the Dakotas.

Travelers thrown together and fight the odds with some emerging as heroes and others as victims.  The ending was very weak as most Indians viewed anyone as weak who did not complete the fight to the death.  This was a different era of movie making and I am sure that most left the theatre with good feelings.
I watch a lot of Westerns for the scenery and this was not filmed in the Dakotas.  Probably nearer Phoenix.  The scenery appeared to be the Southwest.  Easy to be critical.  The acting was good and the pace was fast enough to be interesting.",1456531200,2,646,4.316666666666666

I felt sorry for the great Ward Bond.  Saddled as he was with a cookie cutter stereotype of a part, he did his best to put some life in it.  Good actors wasted in an average movie which is, however, at least a half star better than many B westerns.",1426982400,2,401,4.364864864864865

Goofs: Robertson's character shoots left-handed in his gunfight, but then throws right-handed for the canteen of water.  Darnell's character was wearing Hamilton's boots, but rode away wearing her red high heels.",1424131200,,412,4.828571428571428

223217,4,6300208117,"Acting is realistic , very good.
The storyline takes people from different walks of life and shows they
can try  hard to survive when all of them are in the same boat-
even when some have ulterior motives.
Felt sorry for 'the minstrel' when he went delusional..
When 'Amy'- Linda Darnell sees 'Benner' Dale Robertson would risk
his life to chase -court her , she finally sees he is a decent guy.
The native Cheyenne - well one of them, shows his positive  human nature by making
friends with the 2 survivors , as they had spared his life !",1389484800,2,539,4.38

Hard to believe that a brother and his partner would try and shoot Robertson in the back and steal his share of the bank robbery.  It was really stupid that they did not check to make sure he was dead after they shot him.  Came back to haunt them later.  The Indians were obviously white actors dressed as Indians.  Be more realistic if they used real native Americans.",1487894400,,437,4.154761904761905
