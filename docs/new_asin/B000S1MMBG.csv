2878838,1,B000S1MMBG,"This film is sick.  It is designed to appeal to emotions and not to the intellect in order to spread hate and fear of Islam, Arabs and Muslims. It uses the cover of ""anti-semitism"" to defend any critique of a rogue foreign nation (Israel) and then goes on to use this to spread Islamophobia. How hypocritical of the Wiesenthal Center's Moriah Films! Shame on them.

It is very intriguing to note that those who scream ""Anti-Semitism!"" the loudest are also the ones who spread hate and fear of American Muslim individuals and institutions the strongest. All with an agenda to promote and defend their favorite foreign nation from discussion of its brutalities.

After spending millions to develop this film, the Wiesenthal Center continues to show this film on college campuses, where the discussions are led by career Islamophobes, and are steered toward fear and suspicion of American Muslims and American mosques. [..] I find this extremely dangerous in that it pollutes the minds of college students, using trained professionals, with the sick Islamophobic way of thinking.  I hope the developers of the film have some shame and stop using the violent and sensational imagery within in to promote hate and fear and bigotry of Islam Muslims and Arabs.",1239148800,,1253,5.009615384615385
2878839,4,B000S1MMBG,"Ever Again is a powerful film.  Costner's narration is a great addition to the film.  He speaks clearly and in an appropriate tone I feel fits the scene.

Ever Again presents a horrifying picture of modern anti Semitism, but the film never suggests a solution to the problem or how it is being handled.

Many say the film's stance on criticism of Israel as being anti Semetic is not well thought out.  I disagree.  Even Israelis criticize their own governement, just as anyone else in the world.  What the film is trying to point out is the idea Israel should not exist incites anti Semetic action by groups around the world.

I wish the film makers would have made this idea more clear.  It is an important message to take into account and I don't feel everyone who watched the film understood this point unless they had lived through it.",1221523200,8,839,4.54
2878840,3,B000S1MMBG,"""Ever Again"" is a very imformative and timely documentary about the rise of Islamic extremism and anti-Semitism in Europe. It is sober, articulate and well documented showing that the European Union's very openess and multi cultural tolerance shields extremists who take advantage of European freedom and tolerance to preach for its demise.

I think it's required watching for all liberals and people of the left who have a knee jerk reaction against any measures taken up against Islam. The truth is, European societies have to step in and try to curb the rise of this totalitarian wave that is militant Islam.

However, this documentary steps on uneven ground when it tries to draw links between academics and extremist Islam.  There is nothing more irritating than being called an anti-semite when criticizing Israel. Israel is a country. It is a political entity. To equate Israel to the Jewish people worldwide is erroneous and nationalistic in scope. If I criticize the Chinese government am I anti-Chinese? If I disagree with the policies of the Russian government in Chechnya does that mean I hate Russians?

""Ever Again"" falters horribly when it tries to equate legitimate criticism of Israel by academics with the virulent, racially-charged anti-Semitism of Al Qaeda and neo-Nazism.  One thing that particularly irritated me was the reliance on Alan Dershowitz as an ""expert"" on these ""anti-Semitic"" academics.  Dershowitz is painted as some kind of sober analyst of anti-Semitism when he is anything but. He attacks both Noam Chomsky and Norman Finkelstein, two fellow academics and Jews, who have raised legitimate concerns about Dershowitz' own work.  His attack against Finkelstein is particularly amusing considering Finkelstein notoriously humiliated Dershowitz by picking apart his book ""The Case for Israel"" paragraph by paragraph and showing it to be almost completely plagiarized from other debunked pro-Zionist works.

Those concerns being voiced I fully endorse ""Ever Again"" as necessary watching to understand the situation of the world...just take all scenes with Dershowitz with a grain of salt.",1192233600,10,2120,5.403030303030303
2878841,4,B000S1MMBG,this was a documentary movie about what is going on today in our world . we must be aware of the things that are going on today and will be part of us if we don't get it and stop another Holcaust.

8203946,2,B000S1MMBG,"This film is a very bigoted and biased veiw which serves to demonetize the Arabs who had lived in the Area of what has been called Israel after the 1948 takeover of the land by Zionist Nationalist Jews from the majority Arab population who were about 2/3'rds in that time period in time. Most of the Jews were those who had immigrated from Europe. The Arab (Palestinian) population were about 98% at the end of the first world war. The Jewish population olny owned about 7% of the land when they declared their Independance from British Colonial Mandate. This is what the indigenous Arabs call ""The Nakba"" ( The Catastrophe), as they were ethnically cleansed from their homes and villages, by what were considerd to be Zionist Jewish terrorist groups by the British. The Zionist did not want to come and assimilate into the exsisting populations as they had done in other parts of the world. They wanted all the land for Jews only. They massacred people and drove them off of their lands. That's ethnic cleansing. It continures to this very day. What do you think the illegal settelments are? What about the mass bombing on the Gaza Strip in 2008-2009, 2012, and the very worst 2014. War crimes were commitied by Israe. Read the United Nations report.
It's true that the Jews of Europe were persecuted by Christians for centuries, but that does not give the State of Israel the right to commit mass genocide against the Palestinian Arabs. Read your history.
The reason there is an increase in Anti-Semetic actions is largley because of the vioations of human rights and international law by the State of Israel. It's the same as Anti-American because of the damage we have cause by acts of military agression in the region. Israel claims to be the voice of the Jews of the world, but it is not. It does more harm to the Jews of the world by it's policies and disregaurd for International Law.",1510790400,,1892,4.667664670658683

8203951,4,B000S1MMBG,"Some important truths and facts to face.  The overarching theme is one of hope, that with knowledge and speaking out, violence and hatred can be erased.
But is that true? The film missed the important link between Hitler, Nazis and Islam.  During WW2, Yasser Arafat's uncle was Grand Mufti of then British controlled Jerusalem . He met with Hitler, and inspired the yellow Star of David armbands. The prophet  Mohammed had done something very similar centuries before. Mein Kampf remains a best seller in Islamic countries.  So then, is the danger only among extremists?  The extremists may act, but this hatred of Jews is mainstream Islam. Muslims believe that purging the world of all Jews is essential to bringing about Allah's kingdom on earth. Thier Quran speaks of the time when Islam will rise and dominate, and even the trees will call out to Muslims to come and kill the Jews hiding behind them
It may be too late for England, France and much of Europe. In the name of diversity and multiculturalism they have acquiesced their freedoms. England has two sets of laws, one for Muslims (Sharia), and one for everyone else, because Muslims demanded to live under their own set of laws. They demanded that schools stop teaching about the Holocaust. So schools caved in to Muslim demands. Again, this is not extremists, but mainstream Muslims demanding these accommodations.
Europe seems ill prepared and/ or unequipped to deal with the threat. We saw this is the attacks at the Charlie Hebdo offices. Unarmed police were lambs at slaughter.
With the recent influx of 'refugees' into Europe, things will get worse. There are legitimate refugees, but the crisis has been seized by those who wish to impose Islam on the world.  Many of these 'refugees' are young military age males. Isis has bragged that they are sending fighters in among the masses of those fleeing war.
Overall, kudos for speaking up, but it's a bit Pollyanna.",1445817600,,1931,4.889908256880734
