8214178,5,B000UP883G,"This video is so adorable, the students in my class have memorized the songs and stand up and sing along with all kinds of ""Antics"" themselves.. They want to watch it every Friday...however we are in Florida and winter is pretty much over. I love the redone Beach Boy's tunes... My sweet little 1&1/2 year old Grandson likes it too.. Great video...",1425340800,2,348,4.629032258064516

8214180,5,B000UP883G,"I, a grown woman, love the title video portion of this DVD.  The songs are hilarious, catchy, toe tapping, and educational.  My favorite is the love song/rock ballad complete with guitar solo.  A very close second is the beatnik style poem that allows for some audience participation (besides the finger snapping).  Besides me though, kids love this DVD- the songs are memorable enough that they can sing along and cool enough that they will want to!",1289088000,4,450,4.881578947368421
8214181,5,B000UP883G,I've been using the Antarctic Antics VHS tape with primary kids for 5 or 6 years. Fun poems with some Emperor Penguin facts and the kids love the songs. I was surprised to hear Raul Malo singing a penguin love song the first time we watched.,1216166400,3,241,4.260869565217392
