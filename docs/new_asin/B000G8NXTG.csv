8129506,5,B000G8NXTG,"We have a severely limited special needs daughter. She's 19, but she still loves ""kid"" videos, ""Dragon Tales"" being one of them. This DVD is her favorite of all of the Dragon Tales DVDs we've purchased for her. She enjoys the music and the colorful characters. And, if we had a choice, as parents, of a children's program that we'd have to see and hear over and over through the years, I must say that ""Dragon Tales"" has been a pleasure. Thank goodness it wasn't ""Teletubbies"" or ""Barney"" or (fill in the blank with your annoying children's program of choice)... We are truly thankful to our daughter for her good taste. :^)",1428969600,2,624,4.580357142857143

8129513,5,B000G8NXTG,"My 2 girls (ages 3 & 4 yrs) love to watch Dragon Tales, but recently our local PBS channel changed there line up and no longer show Dragon Tales.  I've been searching for some DVDs and finally found them here on Amazon.  Since I've got this in the mail, my girls have watched it almost everyday.  It teaches them Team Work, How to Speak Spanish and other great tools for their age.  It also has a ""Play Continuously"" option.  It was a great price (under $5) too.",1315353600,5,462,4.264367816091954
