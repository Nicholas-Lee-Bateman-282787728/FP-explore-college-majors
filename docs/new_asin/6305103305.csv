976211,3,6305103305,"This is a movie that you can watch once and it won't bore you. It starts well and heightens the expectations, but the sequence of events in between and the ending is average. The fact that this movie does not actually provide a motive for the killing is a major reason why I've taken off 2 of the 5 stars. The 3 boys do a good job of their roles and look far more skilled for their age. All in all, a movie that can be watched once. 3 stars for this one.",1195430400,2,454,3.89247311827957
976212,4,6305103305,"My remarks toward this picture
Coming-of-age sagas are frequently burdened with threat, especially because the genre has been so overworked and even pulverized into clich. Yet young filmmaker, John Fawcett, pulls off a coup with this hip and arresting drama that's full of spit and attitude, and is relentlessly in your face, whether you like it or not. The Genie-nominated, first-time Toronto director, working from Genie-nominated writer, Peter Wellington's edgy, intellectual script, re-invigorates the genre with panache.
He does so by balancing climactic suspenseful elements with authentic human insights. He does it with a first-rate cast, led by Chris Penn as a psychotic cop killer badly affected by a grim childhood who, when he had reached his breaking point, I guess you could say in a sense, had me on the edge of my seat till I was fully assured that he was conquered-such riveting performance was that compelling. A performance so compelling, it earned him a nomination as Best Actor at the 1996 Genie Awards. Here, Penn really delivers his finest since co-starring in Abel Ferrara's elegiac gangster film, The Funeral. (Even the title itself screams of great mourning for that which is irrecoverably past.)
The three youths played by our rising young stars are at loose ends during a teachers' strike that has closed down their small Ontario town's high school. The three friends, who dispute because their social and intellectual instincts tug in three dramatically different directions, find themselves in a quandary one afternoon as they head toward their secluded shack deep into the wilderness where the pressures of growing up do not have to be faced; however, that severely wounded and yet armed stranger in whom they discover hiding out inside may just be their ticket to real adventure. Overriding common sense, they decide to help the stranger, who we find out is named Luke, rather than report the incident to the police.
""If you want something, you just take it, and then it's yours,"" Luke says, and they do, and they love it. They get themselves into trouble and the thought of getting themselves in insubordinate acts excites them. (spoiler) What is so clever with regards to this piece is that, even when, through the audiences' eyes, we want to wail out the words: Wake up, stupid! when one of our teen heroes is about to make a mistake in judgment, the Fawcett-Wellington team make those mistakes understandable. We sympathize. We comprehend. We're involved.
The ambivalence and complexity of the struggle are why The Boys Club has accurately been called a cross between Stand By Me and River's Edge, two landmark films that explored teen anguish with a piercing intelligence, never pandering to the youths or condescending them.
Fawcett walks the same wobbly tightrope, even if The Boys Club remains as a modest film, at least, in scale, that will not gain the notoriety of either Stand By Me or River's Edge.
On the other hand, Penn is a towering force, a raging bull-of-a-catalyst in our teen protagonists' lives. Dominic Zomprogna-being the one to play the part of Kyle-perfectly essays the confused youth torn between intellect and impulse; Stuart Stone, who plays the part of Brad, is a terrific counterbalance as the practical one, while the charismatic Devon Sawa-a dead ringer for Leonardo DiCaprio-is pure feral instinct. (According to Sawa, his character in the film, whose name is Eric, is so unlike himself that it really puts his acting skills to the test. The Boys Club has generally been his most challenging film yet, and yet he passes with flying colors.) Nicholas Campbell provides a compellingly sad-sophisticated portrayal of Kyle's father.
Their personalities mix, the deeming of both their feud and friendship bond and the palpable danger of the narrative ups the emotional stakes. (spoiler)
The Boys Club is not at all just kids' play. It is an inexorable and deeply powerful film that tests friendships and human insight, and yet it doesn't ever overdraw upon a single factor that would diminish it from being the masterpiece that is, because that's precisely what it is despite of the fact that it was shot as a Canadian film on a skin-and-bones budget, will not be released in most countries-which is a shame-and was shown at only a few theaters in Canada. (Mind you, it, however, is available on VHS and DVD in, aside from Canada, Australia and the U.S. as well.)
The Boys Club, although the affect it has upon me isn't quite as great as it once was-for I have now watched it so many times, that it has reached an extent where the amount can no longer be counted anymore-it, nonetheless, is a film that will forever be special to me. Not only because the tension that was generated by these kids in danger influenced me to become a writer, an interest that has drastically altered me as a person, for I now I'm capable of expressing my feelings in a way I never thought possible; but, in addition, because, after having stepped inside a video store one glorious day, it instantaneously drew me to purchase a copy of it on DVD despite of the fact that I merely had a VCR-a machine that was left setting alone no longer, for I the following day ended up purchasing the player itself, a highly sophisticated machine in technology that has forever altered both my experience and outlook upon movie-viewing.",1005609600,5,5363,4.933628318584071

Definitely give this movie a watch if you're on the fence about it. Alot of great acting. And again if you're a teen girl from the 90s...hey hey Devon Sawa! Enjoy!",1514073600,,314,4.338983050847458

7884329,5,6305103305,"Three boys have a shack in the woods which is found one day by a fugitive running from the law. At first the boys befriend him, but it
becomes clear, after an incident with one of the boys' girlfriends, who follows them there, that this fugitive is not a nice guy. He tries
to get the girl into an embarrassing situation, and the boys at first enthralled, soon get scared that he has gone too far.  None of
them will stand up to him however, and he becomes controlling.  The girl gets away, but will not reconcile with her 'boyfriend',
which both embarrasses him and angers him. The fugitive decides the boys are going to get him a means of escape.  They
try and many incidents occur.  The theme of friendship is strong. Also the old adage of two's company, three's a crowd makes
a strong appearance. There is a fear factor and strong vibrant acting on the part of the boys. As a coming of age film it takes
all the stars. Pictures of nude women on the shack's walls are a very minor caution.  Too intense for under 12 audiences in
my opinion.  Superior movie for themes mentioned above.",1411603200,2,1087,4.383084577114428

7884331,3,6305103305,"Three boys circa 14 years old have a shack in the woods where they go as a clubhouse. They have pin up girls and smoke cigarettes. The story centers around Kyle (Dominic Zamprogna) who is typically tongue tied around girls. Things are pretty normal until Luke, (Chris Penn) a strange man, shows up with a bullet hole in his leg. The boys think this is cool and do what they can to aid him...something which horribly backfires.

The movie is tame for the first 50 minutes. It isn't until Luke has mobility does things pick up. The acting was okay, but the plot was a bit flat. Let's just say it's a Canadian thriller.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Pin-up nudity. Sexual intimidation.",1396569600,2,677,4.586776859504132
7884332,4,6305103305,"An American cop killer and sociopath (Penn) on the run winds up in a small Canadian town, seeking refuge in a clubhouse in the local woods and befriended by three naive 14 year-old delinquents who frequent it. When they discover the true colors of their new ""friend"", it's already too late. Impressive and not-too-known thriller held afloat by solid script and a cold, calculating performance by the late Chris Penn, who sears the screen in every scene he's in.  DVD quality is poor but tolerable.",1344643200,,497,4.847058823529411
