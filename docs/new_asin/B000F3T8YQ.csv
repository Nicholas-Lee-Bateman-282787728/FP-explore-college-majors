2550306,5,B000F3T8YQ,"I watched this series a long time ago and was absolutely thrilled to see it available on Amazon! It's a very very well done series about a coroner in the U.K.  It's very well acted and the story lines are great as well as the influence of the personal life of the central character (similar to ""Vera"" and ""Blue Murder"" series). I'm so looking forward to receiving this!",1407110400,51,369,4.426470588235294
2550307,4,B000F3T8YQ,"Amanda Burton is excellent in this series that I viewed ages ago on PBS. I thought it would eventually come out on a region 1 DVD, but to date, it hasn't. Recently I purchased an all region DVD player, and I ordered the first 4 seasons of Silent Witness. Although the quality of the picture is not the greatest, it's good; and the series itself is as gritty and interesting as I remember. Over the years, I've become less tolerant of family situations and drama among detectives, police, and forensics experts in TV series; and Silent Witness does have plenty of emotional baggage. But the cast is excellent, and Amanda Burton is worth suffering the occasional family intrigue (which is sometimes humorous). I have not seen the series after she leaves the cast, but there are several seasons with her as Sam Ryan. They are worth adding to your collection.",1406592000,18,855,4.706666666666667
2550308,2,B000F3T8YQ,"I love British mysteries and have been through all the best of them.  So in my never ending quest for more I gave Silent Witness a try.  I wanted to like it.  I found the lead character very cold and wasn't really drawn to her or intrigued enough by her to want to continue the series.  However, the stories were engrossing so I stayed a little longer.  In the second story, I found some of the sex scenes frankly pornographic and one scene very degrading.  This was disturbing to me.  I also didn't like the gory views of the decomposed body.  I did appreciate that the series did not have grossly offensive language--at least to the point I watched.  These crime shows seem eager to plumb greater and greater depths of depravity and keep pushing the envelope.  How far can this go?  Where are  the series with just good stories and compelling characters like Morse?",1401840000,28,867,4.52258064516129
2550309,4,B000F3T8YQ,"Have been and still waiting for this series to be put on dvd for the US and Canada.
Watch this on PBS several years ago found the storyline and acting great.
What is taking so long to put it in the market for USA???",1392595200,,215,3.909090909090909
2550310,5,B000F3T8YQ,"This series is typical of the high quality TV that is being produced in the UK and Europe. There is none of the gore/sex crimes/silly plots that are found in most American TV series (e.g. Bones, CSI, Criminal Minds, etc.). The acting is superb, the characters in Silent Witness are deep and develop, over time, in a reasonable way,  - the pace is slower than in US shows and usually require the audience to have patience while the story develops.",1349395200,22,446,4.575
2550321,5,B000F3T8YQ,Amanda Burton is terrific and I love the look and atmosphere of this short (only four episodes) series. Hope there are more episodes in future.,1483920000,,143,4.76

2550328,3,B000F3T8YQ,"Beginning of a new series in the life of a police pathologist. Interesting but a way to go. Much later in this series, with an additional staff member, and more exciting and intriguing plotlines this series becomes wonderful. The series is long, but it's not worth my while, or cost, to continue with series to discover where it becomes worthwhile viewing.",1476662400,,356,4.852459016393443

2550371,1,B000F3T8YQ,"We love British mysteries but this one isn't the typical crime movie.  No police, DI, no nothing, just a coroner who solves the crime by examining the body; hence the name Silent Witness.  We gave it a shot - watched 1 episode, tried to get through episode 2 and quit midway.  Not our cuppa tea.",1459468800,,295,4.327272727272727
2550372,4,B000F3T8YQ,Four one hour & half stories. Two we liked a lot. Other two OK.  From 1996  kinda dated but still relevant. Arrived on time and  in good order. Good price.,1458432000,,155,4.1

2550393,5,B000F3T8YQ,"Just found out about this show. It's been around since the mid 90's and they are up to Season 18 in the U.K. Okay I thought, something that has been around for 2 decades deserves a chance. So I purchased the DVD and boy was it worth it. Absolutely loved Amanda Burton's character. The stories were great too as they held up and did not seem dated. Thoroughly enjoyable. Bought Season 2 and am working my way through that as well. What is also interesting about this show is seeing Actors who came to prominence later starring here when they were 1st starting out like Idris Elba who starred in the Season 2 Episode ""Blood, Sweat & Tears"".",1446422400,,638,4.415254237288136

2550482,3,B000F3T8YQ,Interesting.....kinda. Each episode is an hour and a half long and I found the pacing rather slow. The back story of the lead was well developed and well done but the crime & solution seemed incidental and only necessary to further the lead's character development. Would I watch it again? No. Would I recommend it to be purchased? No. Would I recommend it to someone else? With caveats.,1420675200,11,387,4.705882352941177

2550496,4,B000F3T8YQ,"I've watched this British series several times over the years and I never tire of Amanda Burton as the demanding, know-it-all, on-her-way-to-be chief medical examiner. You'll never tire of watching her put her outdated male colleagues in their place. These guys could be living quite happily in the 19th century. They seem definitely not to have noticed that women are invading the quiet, smelly halls of the morgue. The plots are pretty sophisticated for 1996. And the forensics are adequate, but it is 1996, so don't expect too much CSI-level pyrotechnics.

One thing this series does very, very well, and it has nothing to do with whether or not it is dated -- unlike some newer police/pathologist procedurals, Amanda Burton's extended family and her difficulties with them, and theirs with her, form a seamless part of each plot. Her young nephew is always sticking his nose in where he isn't required. Burton's long-suffering sister really has had a less exciting and profitable career because she, of necessity, had to care for their aging mother. Burton is seen as the family member who has made it big, but who has also walked over and across others, including family, in order to achieve material and career success. These issues seem a little dated in this context, but it's extremely well done. Also check out Amanda Burton in another series called Commander. Silent Witness, of the two, is my favorite, however.",1417651200,13,1423,4.9789915966386555

She is flat toned and then suddenly passionate about some emotional part of the investigation and I don't know why. A coroner is not involved with catching criminals and she turns up to help hunt down the killers? Maybe it is the way the thing is shot but I do not feel fooled into believing this show. There are parts of the story that do not have enough background to merit being brought center stage. And I like British detective mysteries A LOT.

2550518,5,B000F3T8YQ,"SILENT WITNESS, season 1starring Amanda Burton, is an outstanding British mystery television series, produced by the British Broadcasting Company in association with the American Arts and Entertainment network. It was an original creation by Nigel McCrery, who also wrote some of the strongest episodes, and debuted in Britain on February 21, 1996. It's filmed on location in Cambridge, and Cambridgeshire. The set consists of two DVDs, each of them containing two episodes, for approximately a goodly 360 minutes; there are also subtitles, though the cast speaks the Queen's English fairly clearly and isn't generally difficult to follow.

Amanda Burton (The Helen West Casebook ) stars as Dr. Sam Ryan, crusading forensic pathologist. She's ably supported by William Armstrong (Capital City - The Complete Series ) as Dr. Trevor Stewart, and Sam Parks (the ""Jurassic Park"" series) as Fred, at the forensics laboratory. The sizzling cop shop cast is headed by Clare Higgins (Hellraiser ) as D.S. Farmer; and John McGlynn (the ""All Creatures Great and Small"" series) as Tom Adams. The Ryan family, which adds so much to the mix, is played by Doreen Hepburn (The Playboys ) as Mum Beryl Ryan; Ruth McCabe (The Snapper;My Left Foot) as Sam's sister Wyn Ryan; Matthew Steer as Wyn's son Ricky Ryan; and Woolf Byrne, whom we see only in flashback, as the paterfamilias.

The Ryan family's been given a riveting backstory: they're from Northern Ireland, and Ryan pere, a high-ranking Protestant policeman, was murdered one morning, in front of his family; the Irish Republican Army had rigged his Land Rover to explode at ignition. We're informed that this has had some pretty drastic effects upon the family, as you might expect, driving Mum Beryl into dementia; depriving sister Wyn, an intelligent woman, of the will and resources to make a meaningful career for herself; creating a more than difficult and irritating teenage boy in Ricky, and causing Sam to take up the study of the dead, rather than the living. She's rather obsessional about it too, presumably as the result of her father's death; to her, ""a dead body isn't a person. It's a puzzle. A story - with a beginning, a middle and an end."" We therefore sometimes find her exceeding her brief, conducting her own inquiries outside the lab, interviewing witnesses, and generally making things sticky for the cops she's got to work with.

The death of Ryan pere is neither the first, nor the last time we're going to see blood and guts on this show, so be forewarned if that sort of thing will bother you: the packaging itself warns of strong forensic detail and bloody violence. The series' dramatic elements are unusually strong; the mysteries are strong, original, and female-oriented. They are:

BURIED LIES. Examination of the body of a six-year old girl, who is assumed to have fallen from a rope swing over a river and drowned, suggests other possibilities.
LONG DAYS, SHORT NIGHTS. The cops are sure they've arrested the right man for a gruesome, apparently ritual killing. Sam isn't. Features particularly strong performances from guest stars Colin Salmon (Prime Suspect 2 ) as Sebastian Bird ; Ronald Pickup(The Sherlock Holmes Catalogue - The Hound Of The Baskervilles ) as Dr. Richard Owen, and Emily Mortimer (Young Adam ) as Fran.
DARKNESS VISIBLE. The death of  a homosexual man in police custody looks like the work of his cellmate. But Sam isn't so sure, and the station wishes to avoid any suggestion of a cover-up. Features a particularly strong performance from greatly-praised TV actor, guest star Ken Stott (The Vice: The Complete Series ) as Sgt. Bob Claire.
SINS OF THE FATHERS. A charred body is found in the ruins of a Vietnamese restaurant; Sam must decide whether it was murder or an accident. The case affects her deeply and results in tragic consequences. I found this episode extremely powerful; it also lingers in my memory.

This series, when on broadcast TV, was appointment television for me. I really loved, and love it, at least in this first incarnation.",1407628800,101,4050,4.992592592592593
