8440966,5,B004TWOWUE,"Anyone who has the slightest interest in classical ballet should purchase this.  The filiming is crude by today's standards it doesn't matter.
The dancers are spellbinding.  Classic dancing at its best.",1340409600,2,202,5.483870967741935
8440967,4,B004TWOWUE,"10 stars for the Sylphides, minus stars for the Giselle -- but get this DVD for the wonderful and well photographed dancing in Les Sylphides. Never mind that the film is fuzzy at times -- you see the whole dancer (with a few closeups of what counts, the FEET and the footwork) and the shape of the scene. And you see a younger Alicia Markova than in any other ballet film I know of -- as the Joan Aconcella  New Yorker review that made me buy the DVD points out.

Markova is an icon of balance and expressivity, some of us think the pinnacle. But the other ballerinas in the Sylphides scenes are almost on the same level. The dancing is pure condensed, balance, artistry, and impeccable technique, with the added pleasure of breathtaking co-ordination among the corps de ballet. Marvelous antidote to the modern ""6 0'clock"" 180 degree extensions and ""I can do it so I will"" distortions that take so much away from recent productions. The music even seems more balanced to the ballet, even though the sound recording isn't to a modern standard.

I hated the Giselle (which unfortunately takes up much of the space). It's mostly closeups of dancers' faces with an occasional head to knee shot, interspersed with confused scenes of the large cast walking about flat-footed, and the dancers seem too busy mugging up for the camera to bother to dance, much of the time. The corps ballerinas seem more interested in self-expression than in ensemble even when the camera is pulled back enough to show a scene (most noticeable in the last scenes, where arms seem to move and position themselves when and as the individual dancers choose. (Your mileage may vary, and the disk is more than worth the price for Markova alone.)",1317686400,10,1715,4.691029900332226
