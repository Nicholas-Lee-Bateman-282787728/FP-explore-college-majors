6454589,3,B00KYYDDFQ,"Not what I had expected - I had hoped for more lost live footage, but a lot of the time was spent on interviews of various people that had worked with Stevie.  Granted, these interviews were extremely interesting but I had unrealistic expectations about seeing clips of footage that I have never seen before.",1414195200,15,308,4.703703703703703
6454590,5,B00KYYDDFQ,"Great dvd. Arrived quickly, great quality. I was lucky enough to see him perform live. This is as good as it's going to get now that he is no longer with us. Great guitar player.",1413158400,4,178,4.114285714285714

6454595,5,B00KYYDDFQ,A great DVD for any Stevie Ray fan. I really takes you to his beginings and tells you how he became the amazing world wide legend in the Blues. I had the privilige of seeing him in 83 and he was truly amazing.,1412121600,17,209,3.883720930232558
6454596,5,B00KYYDDFQ,Stevie Ray vaughan was one of the best guitar players ever. This movie shows how great he was.  I recommend this movie,1411516800,2,118,4.363636363636363
6454597,5,B00KYYDDFQ,Really nice presentation. Stevie from the beginning and development as an artist. Lot's of historical content and perspective. Comments from those who knew him best. The only part that is missing is some closing passage about that fateful night and the final moments in his life. I will always remember the excitement in his music and the awful feeling of loss upon hearing the tragic news,1410912000,36,389,4.909090909090909

6454600,5,B00KYYDDFQ,"I saw this on a streaming service and did not purchase the DVD. I will say that it is a piece focused on the development of SRV from a youngster to a point in time when he was truly rising to the top. It does include a lot of interviews about people who knew him, unfortunately not Jimmy (I have not finished it yet-so unless he is in the last 30mins) It also educates on the whole Texas Blues scene, Austin and Dallas and some of the pioneers as well as many 'legends' that profited from this virtuoso rising and gaining recognition. A good piece, could have used more SRV footage and interviews with the man himself, but I understand his estate did not approve (always money!!!). Listen this is best damn guitarist for blues-based rock and plain blues ever.. Jimi Hnedrix? Yeah talented for sure, but SRV...come on now! Just you tube ""SRV warming up"", a short piece of him doing a sound check. I also saw him about 1983-in Buffalo, NY-i think he was warming up for a solo Robert Plant tour, can't remember that ironically-but I had never heard of him and I was like 'Say what!"" incredible. Anyway, very good documentary.",1471046400,,1122,4.478048780487805

6454610,5,B00KYYDDFQ,This is a really great documentary about Stevie's rise in Music History.  It was as in depth as I have seen on him and also the Texas Blues scene.  I highly recommend it.  You won't be disappointed.,1434067200,,198,4.297297297297297

6454618,1,B00KYYDDFQ,"This is an UNAUTHORIZED documentary of Stevie Ray Vaughn given by band mates of his very early band (<1983).  It uses old clips and photos that the estate can't control.  Basically rubbish.  I understand how these old musicians may want to capitalize on Stevie's legacy to make some money.  But this should be clear, its not quality work, its boring and repetitive.  DON'T BUY",1426118400,4,376,4.8125
6454619,3,B00KYYDDFQ,"I bought this vid believing that it was gonna be a tracking of the life of SRV.  What this is, is basically a history lesson on the origin and roots of the blues, how different styles and licks have been handed down through the years.  There is some new footage that I hadn't seen before, and some really good interviews, but SRV was more of ""in the line-up"" of every bluesman up to the end of his career.  This is definitely not a focus on Stevie himself.",1425945600,3,456,4.218390804597701
6454620,4,B00KYYDDFQ,"Great footage and insightful interviews from Doyle Bramhall, Denny Freeman and a few others who knew Stevie well in the beginning. I found the history of Texas blues to be very incomplete due to the failure of any mention of the late great Freddie King. Overall though I found it to be informative and accrediting to one of the greatest bluesman of the last century. I only wonder what he'd be contributing to this American art form if he were still alive today. But I'm certain that he is glorifying God with the precious gift of music that God Himself gave him. Stevie's last few years on this earth were lived as a new creation in Jesus Christ. Looking forward to the day when I will finally get to mean him in heaven.",1425686400,,721,4.428571428571429

6454624,5,B00KYYDDFQ,Great DVD!!  Stevie Ray was one of a kind!  Perhaps the greatest guitarist to combine Rock and Blues and opened the eyes of many who hadn't been influenced by the Blues!  Long live SRV!,1424131200,,185,4.382352941176471

6454627,2,B00KYYDDFQ,"This documentary missed a lot of important biographical  information, like the circumstances around his death and even when he died--that wasn't even mentioned. It spend far too much time on interviews that didn't add value, and completely ignored his personal life. I don't feel like I learned anything...",1422748800,10,306,5.375
6454628,1,B00KYYDDFQ,"Disappointing.  While good to see some early photos and footage as this documentary wasn't made with the approval of his estate so you don't get to hear from Double Trouble, his brother or anyone really that close to him.  They have to use the same old talking heads again and again.

Similarly, the only use footage that his estate don't control only goes up to '83 - hence the title - and much of what you see is grainy and of poor quality.",1422403200,12,442,4.301204819277109

This doc is very informative, showed pics of Stevie since he was a kid and showed some of his amazing
performances.  I cannot recommend this dvd more highly.  If you love Stevie you will love this look at him.
When he played, he gave it everything that he had.  It's incredible to watch.",1421366400,,392,4.328767123287672

6454637,2,B00KYYDDFQ,"The thing is, If I were to watch this video without knowing the title or seeing the DVD cover, I would think this was a Texas Blues documentary instead of a SRV piece.  Since this video wasn't approved by Stevie's estate, a lot of filler material was included along with the same musical selections and pictures being played and shown over and over. I'm a huge SRV fan who is excited about anything that involves Stevie Ray but i must say this was a disappointment.",1419552000,28,465,4.470588235294118
