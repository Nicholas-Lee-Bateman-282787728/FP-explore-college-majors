You have to try and guess what they are saying and it is just nonsense.  The first few episodes were great, however it has been downhill since then.  May not even
finish watching the series because you get a headache trying to make sense of the 'English'.  I don't know if it was just a computerized translation
or translated from Korean to Chinese to English -- whatever they did, spoiled it for those of us who do not speak Korean.  Wish I did.",1530489600,,575,4.377358490566038
