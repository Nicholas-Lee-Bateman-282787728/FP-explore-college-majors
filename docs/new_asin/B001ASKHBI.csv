Andy James is one of the best modern guitarists out there.",1363996800,,172,4.40625
8623949,5,B001ASKHBI,"I,m a big fan of Zakk and all his music, and as I was aware that his playing is essentially based around the minor pentatonic, I purchased this DVD to get an insight into his licks. The DVD is very well presented, easy to follow, and taught in a realistic style.
All I can do is state the licks are quite simple, melodic, and great to play. But to play like Zakk, you have to play them fast!!! But in saying that, slowing them down can create a whole new context to them.
Very happy with my purchase, and am sure many guitarists would enjoy as much as I do. Cheers.",1287014400,4,565,4.099099099099099
