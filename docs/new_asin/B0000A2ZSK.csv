It's no longer on Nick Jr so we've collected our favorites on vhs and dvd. And did you know the voice of Oswald is Fred Savage? Love the sweetness and music of each episode.

This vhs volume 'Outdoors with Oswald' features four episodes:
""A Day at the Beach""
""The Sand Sculpture Contest""
""The Tomato Garden""
""Bird Watching""",1392854400,,431,4.5256410256410255

I especially think his friend Henry is hilarious! Parents can enjoy this video as well as any other Oswald video with their little one and not be bored! You gotta love that!",1258070400,,317,4.482758620689655
