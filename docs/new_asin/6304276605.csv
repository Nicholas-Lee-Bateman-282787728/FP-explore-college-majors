832477,5,6304276605,"Move over Kill Bill, the japanese were more inventive with their sword fights thirty years ago. These films (all six) are breathtakingly beautifull, well acted, well coreographed and highly entertaining. If you've read the comics, don't worry, the writer and illustrator helped make sure that all six movies are very close to the comic, and as movies, stand on par with their inspiration. The lead actor is trained in samurai sword use so there is no six month crash course to get him up to snuff for the movies like Tom Cruise or Uma Thurman had to do, and it shows! If you like horror films (there is an awfull lot of blood, one of the many things Tarantino took from this genre) then this should give you a welcome change of focus. Anyone who likes Holloywoods new interest in comic adaptations should be pleased with this. Yes, the DVD transfer is not the greatest, but it really depends what type of T.V. you have. I still give five stars based on my belief that you will not see any films of this genre that are better than these subtle masterpieces from the early seventies. Definitely worth owning.",1070409600,8,1106,4.590909090909091

Obviously, even when transferring the story into six films, some of the 8000+ page story had to be cut out, but all of the important plot points are there. The DVD transfers for these films are amazing. The picture is crisp, the audio is great and the subtitles are some of the best I have seen. The DVD also comes with a booklet that explains important aspects in 16th century Japanese society for American audiences to better understand the story. Animeigo (Samurai Cinema) is currently transferring their entire Samurai catalog into DVD format and this was their first release and it is very well done. Unfortunately, many people have been tricked into getting the ""Shogun Assassin"" movie, which is a poor edit of the first few Lone Wolf and Cub films into a single and fairly nonsensical film released by another production company. There is just too much to be told in a single film and it is only with the entire six part story (which this film begins) that one can fully appreciate the ultimate tale of revenge that is Lone Wolf and Cub.",1062892800,18,1159,4.55023923444976

So better put grandma off to bed unless she likes to see guy's with swords through there head's! The DVD transfer is great and the picture is great for the prodution it went through originaly.

832482,4,6304276605,"I have spent the last 138 days reading one chapter of the manga epic ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" by Kazuo Koike and Goseki Kojima, only to discover the 28th and final volume has been delayed in publication.  To while the time I have turned to the six films adapted from the celebrated comic book.  ""Kozure kami: Kowokashi udekashi tsukamatsuru"" (""Lone Wolf and Cub: Sword of Vengeance"") is the first of these films and it is fascinating to look at what specific stories Koike decide to use as the basis for this first film.
The basic narrative framework of ""Sword of Vengeance"" is taken from the eighth episode, ""Wings to the Bird Fangs to the Beast,"" where Okami Itto (Tomisaburo Wakayama) and Daigoro (Akihiro Tomikawa) cross a rickety bridge and enter the Gomori-Juku Hot Springs Spa.  The place has been taken over by brigands and Lone Wolf seems oblivious to what is going on until he decides to come to the aid of Osen (Tomoko Mayama), a prostitute pickpocket.  This is an extremely interesting choice to be the main story for this film since it has nothing to do with why Ogami Itto is walking the assassin's road.
""Sword of Vengeance"" also includes the two pivotal backstory episodes from the magna series (although there are elements from a few others, mostly involving foreshadowing).  In ""The White Path Between the Rivers"" (the seventeenth), Ogami Itto serves as the Kogi Kaishakunin execution to act as second to a young lord's seppuku and then finds himself the victim of Yagyu intrique that results in the death of his wife, Azani (Reiko Kasahara) and his implication in an act of treason. Then in ""The Assassin's Road"" (the ninth) where Daigoro choose to walk the path with his father, refuses to commit seppuku, and confronts Retsudo Yagyu (Tokio Oki) for the first time.
Koike and director Kenji Misumi keep the sex and violence from the manga intact.  There are lots of fountains of spurting blood as Ogmai Itto slays his foes with his Dotanuku sword.  Tomisaburo Wakayama is a stockier Ogami Itto than what was drawn (I thank Frank Miller's cover for Volume 3 of the manga is clearly based more on the actor than Kojima's drawings of Lone Wolf), but he captures the deadly silence of the assassin.  Tokio Oki looks more like a Kabuki figure as Retsudo, but that is certainly within the tradition of samurai films (at least of those I have seen not made by Akira Kurosawa).
Still, it is the script that I keep coming back to when I mull over this film, espeically Koike's decision to make ""Wings to the Bird Fangs to the Beast"" the centerpiece of the film.  It makes me wonder what Stan Lee would have done if he had written the Spider-Man movie.  I doubt he would have been able to bring the story to the screen as intact as Koike is able to do with ""Sword of Vengenace.""  No film could be as good as the original manga, but this certainly does not do the Lone Wolf and Cub story.",1043971200,7,2892,4.596116504854369
832483,5,6304276605,"I first got introduced to the lone wolf series in the early eighties when I saw Shogun Assasin. I thought it was great, but to actually find the original Japanese series has been fantastic.
If you like martial arts movies with weaponry and great stories and characters this is a must to have. The original Japanese version is far superior to the Shogun Assasin release.

832484,4,6304276605,"Itto Ogami is the coolest swordsman I have ever seen.  The Chinese  swordsman novels and movies and other samurai movies are not as cool.  Ogami just walked and stood like a stone but when he meant to kill, he  moved elegantly with heads and legs of his enemies just chopped off and  flew away.  For the sake of vengeance, violence became just all beautiful,  it is even erotic, if it is conducted by the master Ogami.
The duel with  the best of the Yagyu Clan and other group fighting scenes, either with  bandits or with samurai, were just perfectly choreographed.  Being betrayed  by the Yagyu Clan, Ogami just turned all his enemies into desperation,  begging for instant death.  He was just too good to be defeated.  With his  wife killed in the betrayal and his family members all eliminated except  his toddler son, Ogami killed like a blood-thirsty lone wolf, with the  vision of creating a world of gore in which human flesh is treated as  sashimi. A surrealist dream is created in the process.

It had great acting, story line,  and amazing choreography.  The action was one of the best I had ever seen  from a true samurai epic.  If you enjoy good, gritty(very bloody!) samurai  films, then you are garunteed a good time here.  This film falls somewhere  in between 'Wu Tang' syle action and serious drama, avoiding both extremes.  The directing is just short of brilliant, and cinematogaphy is beautiful  at times.  Warning; expect to be spending a lot of money for the entire  set, these are very good, addicting films, you'll want to see them all.  The only major flaw in the series is that the ending seems lacking, other  than that I enjoyed them all.  Highly recomended.",957744000,6,874,4.726666666666667

This is my 2nd favorite of the series (Baby Cart At The River Styx is my favorite) but the story is great with some classic moments, Lone Wolf And Cub is a great anti-hero character and of course the blood splashy mayhem is absurdly wonderful.

832662,3,6304276605,"LONE WOLF AND CUB: SWORD OF VENGEANCE is a mediocre samurai film that is mildly enjoyable. Based (apparently) on a series of ""graphic novel"" comic books, this movie is about five-sixths heroic fantasy and one-sixth erotic fantasy.

Directed by Misuni Kenji and starring Wakayama Tomisaburo as Ogami Itto (The Lone Wolf) and Tomikawa Akihiro as his adorable little son (The Cub), this is the first of the ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" series of fantasy-adventure films. It opens with Ogami Itto as a ronin (a masterless samurai) pushing a peculiar homemade baby carriage down a dirt road, looking for ""work"" (i.e., killing people for a price).

A long, significant flashback lets us know why Ogami and his infant son are on the road--Ogami Itto was formerly the Shogun's executioner but was framed for sedition by members of a rival clan who wished to possess that plum position of his. Ogami was attacked by a large number of them, and his wife was murdered by them. Discredited and under sentence of death, he is caring for his son and seeking justified vengeance.

The ""heroic fantasy"" elements here resemble those found in the 1970s TV series KUNG FU, starring David Carradine as Kwai Chang Caine, a Shaolin monk who possessed preternatural martial arts skills. No matter whether 5 or 10 or 20 armed men attacked him, we viewers always KNEW that ""those guys have HAD it!"" The same is true whenever Ogami Itto is attacked by any group, any time, anywhere.

The battles in this film are clever, well choreographed, and quite enjoyable ... though totally unbelievable. The camera work is above average. If you've enjoyed the fight scenes in the wonderful KUNG FU PANDA cartoons, you will probably enjoy these as well.

In case anyone is considering watching this DVD with young children or with parents or grandparents, she or he might want to think twice about that--this film's ""erotic fantasy"" elements involve scenes with female nudity ... one with rape and murder, another with consensual sex between Ogami and a prostitute, ostensibly to save a person's life.

If I were giving this film a letter grade, it would be a ""C+"". Although many fans of this series apparently think that FIVE STARS is a very proper rating for its films, I prefer to give five-star ratings to films that have a bit more substance, such as KAGEMUSHA, RASHOMON, RAN, THE 47 RONIN, SANJURO, YOJIMBO, and THE SEVEN SAMURAI.",1425513600,,2390,4.85995085995086

832773,5,6304276605,"This series of films have been among my absolute favorite since I first saw them more than 30 years ago.

I can remember my first experience with Kozure Ohkami as a young Japanese American youth in early 1970s Los Angeles. One day my friend's dad piled a bunch of us young ""JAs"" into a Mercury Montego and took us to see the fourth movie in the series, Baby Cart In Peril at the long gone Toho LaBrea Theater. One thing nice about growing up in LA in the '60s and '70s is that we got to see a lot of movies unavailable to many people outside of Japanese American communities during the pre-VCR days. While I grew up watching The Man From UNCLE and Gilligan's Island like all my friends, I also had the bonus of being able to enjoy the exploits of Ogami Itto, Zatoichi and a host of Mifune and Nakadai movies.

During my high school years, my friends and I eagerly awaited each pending showing at the Toho. Parts 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 were in heavy rotation during the mid to late '70s, but a part 3 was never shown. It wasn't until the mid '90s when AnimEigo released the series on VHS and laserdisc that I was sure that part 3 was in fact Lightning Swords of Death which was released as a dubbed movie for the mass American public in 1975 during the height of the martial arts craze.

When Toho closed down in the late '70s and became a Korean church Itto, Daigoro and the cart-o-fun moved to the Kokusai in West LA. And when Kokusai closed its doors in the late 1980s, the movies were being shown at Little Tokyo Cinema in downtown LA. By then the prints being shown were completely trashed and it was obvious that for years it was the same prints being circulated for 20 years. One second, amidst a smoking overcast field Itto would be facing Yagyu Gunbei, then the next he would be sitting with Daigoro in front of a cooking pot. Three great fight scenes and about 30 minutes of film had been permanently lost.

During the late 1980s I met a fellow at the Japan Expo who had secured the rights to release the Zatoichi series in the US. I asked him if the Sword of Vengeance series would ever become available. Every year I went back to the Expo and asked him the same question, and every year he told me the same thing. He said he was working on it, but since Katsu Shintaro's [Zatoichi himself] company had gone bust, ownership of the 6 Baby Cart films had been dispersed and it would be difficult to gain the rights to all of them. He said he couldn't just go to one person, but had to deal with many different people.

Well imagine my joy when AnimEigo began making these available. During the mid nineties they were released one episode at a time about every two to three months. When the DVDs were released not too long ago I noticed they appeared very different from the laserdiscs. A scene I had mentioned earlier in which Itto fights assassins in a shrine looks entirely different from VHS and laserdisc to DVD. The VHS and laserdisc depict this scene as being very dark. The interior is dimly lit as one would expect of a musty, little used indoor temple. The people are difficult to make out which adds an air of uncertainty and desperation to the fight sequence. However, on the DVD this same scene is extremely bright and well lit. Blood stains that appeared like dark crimson smears on the laserdisc are bright glowing red on the DVD. It struck me as being artificial looking. To be honest, it has been so long since I saw the original in the theaters, I can't remember which is correct. It's probably somewhere in between. But I will say I greatly prefer watching these movies on laserdisc. They appear more film-like, while the DVDs in spots seem overly contrasty and bright. I wonder if this was done intentionally during mastering. Were certain scenes color adjusted just for the DVD? I also noticed that the English translation is different from the theatrical versions to those released by AnimEigo. I had my father, who was born, raised and educated in Japan watch a series of scenes where I remembered the original theatrical subtitles. We then compared them to the subtitles in the current releases. In the instances I could remember the old subtitles, my dad felt the new releases had the more accurate translation.

Some reviewers on this site have commented that these films don't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with greats like Seven Samurai or even deserve a 5 star rating. I can certainly understand that viewpoint, but I choose to rate films on how they affect me and what they mean to me, not in the overall scheme of movie history. So with that in mind can you imagine the lasting impression a close up of Oyuki's beautiful tattoed breasts made on a young lad in the midst of puberty? Or the shock and repulsion of seeing Retsudo behead his loyal quick change artist and the gushing fountain of blood that ensued. Scenes like that would convince anyone that Japanese have the highest blood pressure of any ethnic group around. I love it!

These films are a look into the morals and trials of Samurai bound to the codes of Bushido during 17th century Japan albeit with a bit of James Bond [especially part 6] mixed in. They're also not too unlike the classic movie Harakiri, in that they focus on the corruptibility of people in high places and the consequences those actions have. Educational and fun! All these films are beautifully photographed, and shot on locations not like the artificial sets of Hong Kong action movies or Japanese Chambara TV serials. Some scenes are unforgettable such as in part 1 when Itto and Kurando face each other in preparation for a duel at sunset in an open field. This scene is also a cinematic example how he who has the advantages of nature does not always prevail in a duel.  Another striking image is from part 4. In one scene there's a camera view down on Ogami Itto pushing the cart-of-goodies. The neat thing is that 95% of the screen is filled with a large tiled roof, while Itto and Daigoro only occupy a corner of the frame. On the other hand, action scenes such as when Itto is fighting a large assembly of various Yagyu warriors in a debossed mini maze showcase battlefield swordsmanship in its starkest and most brutal fashion. Many Michael Myers' Halloween techniques are utilized here. In part 1, during a pivotal scene in which Itto and son are seemingly ready to commit seppuku, the subsequent fight is filmed in an eerily silent manner. Ogami Itto runs slently through his house cutting up the Shogun's officials. You hear no foot steps, no screams, no grunts. All you see is the frantic battle and the sound of the blade cutting through flesh. There is some supernatural jumping in these films, but very little flowery swordplay and posing ala Crouching Tiger nor is the fight choreography presented as an effortlessly balletic dance as that of Nakadai Tatsuya's Tsukue Ryunosuke from Sword of Doom. The techniques in Kozure Ohkami are powerful, direct and meant to kill. Instantly. This isn't Kendo. It is a closer to Batto Jutsu which is a modern practice with roots in the battlefield tested techniques of pre-Tokugawa era warriors. Sure there are some flourishes thrown in for effect, but overall the viewer is hit with the powerful and deadly swordplay of Wakayama Tomisaburo. And in that there is great beauty. Even Itto's sword is the famous Dohtanuki which was a beefy, heavy battlefield sword. Definitely not one for the limp-wristed swordsman.

I truly believe these movies are a must see for any western foley effects artist not familiar with the way Japanese weaponry sounds. I don't think I've ever seen an American film get the sound of a katana right. As much as I liked The Last Samurai, I cringed every time I heard a sword being drawn in that movie. Japanese swords are in wooden scabbards [saya], so the sound is metal against wood, not metal-on-metal as in movies about medieval Europe. This may seem like nit-picking to many, but to me it would be like watching Roman Holiday with the voice of Fred Flintstone coming from Audrey Hepburn. It just isn't right!

It's interesting. Until a few years ago I had no idea these films were originally a manga series. And it is nice to know that the people who are fans of Koike Kazuo's books are pleased with these movies. There was an attempt in the early 1980s to adapt the movies to a weekly television series. The show starred Yorozuya Kinnosuke, but I could never get into them. They had a completely different feel from the movies and lacked the over-the-top charm of the 6 originals. I'm also aware that modern movie versions were made and one even has a conclusion to the series. I bought these versions on Ebay several years ago, but still to this day haven't gotten around to watching them. I think that in itself reveals my devotion and narrow-mindedness where these films are concerned.

I hope you enjoy them as well.",1134950400,29,8890,4.574387947269304
832774,5,6304276605,"This movie reminds me of the 50's movie Horatio Hornbolower staring Gregory Peck in one important way.  It proves that only good things come of having the author of the books write the screenplay.

Since this is based on one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) comics series of all time it had a high standard to meet.  It followed the books so exactly that the subtitles were almost unneeded.

I don't know how exagerated the bloodletting was but that is the only fault one can find with the picture.  The acting is straight,and the story of Ogami walking the assassins road to avenge his wife and clan is classic.

The DVDs are 16:9 anamorphic encoded, and since the original films are have higher aspect ratios than this, they are letterboxed.
The confusion arises from the fact that if your haven't configured your DVD player and TV correctly (in particular, widescreen TVs), the image can appear either squashed (the Toho logo at the start will be oval) or have the sides clipped off.
What you have to do to get the best video quality is
1) if you have a widescreen TV, configure the DVD player so that it knows this, and configure the TV so it knows it is getting widescreen video.  Be careful about TV modes where it displays a 16:9 image in 4:3 with the edges clipped.
2) If you have a regular 4:3 TV, make sure the DVD player is configured this way, otherwise it'll send out a 16:9 signal which will appear squashed on the TV.",1082505600,27,1008,4.4728260869565215
832930,4,6304276605,"This must be one of the best quality DVD transfers I've ever seen for an ""old school"" martial arts movie.  The picture is crisp and excellent.
""Sword of Vengeance"" is part one of the ""Shogun Assassin"" version of the Lone Wolf and Cub movie that was released back in the 1980's and may be the version that most of us are familiar with.  Shogun Assassin was dubbed in English, was faster paced, had a nice, energetic soundtrack and was frankly more entertaining.  Sword of Vengeance is of course the Japanese original and is a great movie by itself.  However, for those of you out there who are hoping to have ""Shogun Assassin"" on DVD will be disappointed.  Sword of Vengeance is much slower paced and I found myself skipping ahead to the fighting scenes.  Still a classic and a must have for any martial arts library.",1082246400,11,816,4.554794520547945
832931,4,6304276605,"People who have read the other reviews already know if this film is for them or not!  But I want to give kudos to AnimEigo for a great job on the little things that would be missed by non-Japanese speakers.  First - the use of different colors in the subtitles during conversations made it really easy to understand who is saying what! Second - the translation of many of the signs (i.e. the baby carriage banner) helped make sense of what was going on. And last, but not least, the additional translations of martial arts styles (Seagull, etc) and other Japanesecentric terms was nice, even though I knew much of them (i.e. sepuku).  None of these makes or breaks the film but having them on the DVD makes the watching that much better!  Having seen how good the first DVD was done I have already ordered and preordered the rest!",1082160000,,830,4.513333333333334
832932,5,6304276605,"this is the epitome of the lone existential hero. lone wolf is one of the first heros who walks the thin line between badguy and goodguy. i'd rather say he is just a different degree of bad guy, not as bad as the men he kills. this first episode sets in motion the reason why  lone wolf and cub are on the run and his sword is hired out. the sword play is very violent yet efficient. you won't see the long drawn out whimsical dancelike choreography of the wuxia-pan films. every move is meant to kill an opponent. in a scene where lone wolf is talking to a potential client, two men try to sneak up on him, an in one sweeping motion he draws, waves his sword around his head and sheaths it before his assailants hit the ground...damn

832935,4,6304276605,While undeniably an excellent transfer was made of this film however the whole film is not on this DVD. The packaging proudly proclaims it is a 2.35:1 ratio presentation but it's only 1.85:1. If you compare the VHS edition of the same film the difference is plain to see. I can only hope that future releases by Animeigo will be properly transfered. We've been waiting years for these DVDs and I'm sorry to say I'm disappointed.,1073865600,3,428,4.644736842105263
832936,5,6304276605,"The DVD transfer is trash?  Um, yeah...For everyone who owns an old VHS copy of the film, throw it out the window and purchase this version.  The movie has NEVER looked and sounded better than it has on this brillant DVD transfer.  You can't tell the film was made over 30 years ago.  Animeigo did a great job restoring the film.  The sound is great, the colors are vibrant, the subtitles are improved and easier to read; complaints do not apply here.  You also get trailers for other LWC films and some Zatoichi films.  And the liner notes are very long, but informative.  You'll learn a lot about the setting of this film from the liner notes.
Lone wolf and cub fans need not hesitate to pick this one up.  If you've never seen the series before, you're in for a treat.  Any lover of samurai films, gorehounds (blood shoots out geyser style), or if you just want to see great action films with a great story and a lot of depth (style AND substance) you need to see these films.  Pick it up before the rumored remake is released, although really the film has been ""remade"" several times (""Shogun Assassin,"" ""Road to Peredition,"" ""Kill Bill"" etc.).  But nothing beats the original.  The ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" series takes ""homage"" films like ""Kill Bill"" to school.
(At the time of this writing Amazon doesn't offer the series, so check out Animeigo's website for even more samurai titles.)",1071705600,8,1387,4.566801619433198

7867163,4,6304276605,"After being framed for treason and losing his wife to an after-hours assault, a former state executioner seeks revenge as a ronin, walking the dusty trails of rural Japan with his three-year-old son in tow. The hallmarks of a generic '70s samurai/kung fu movie are all over this one, from the exploitative camerawork to the bad makeup and sprays of hyper-saturated blood, but despite the obvious tropes it delivers some deep, ruminative storytelling and efficiently lays the groundwork for the five sequels which are soon to follow. Often, we're shocked by an act that seems vile and emotionless, only for a subsequent explanation to flip the script and offer unexpected rationalization. The audience constantly sees Itt (the protagonist) in different lights, filling the character out from all angles while the man himself (stoically played by a convincing Tomisaburo Wakayama) maintains a stiff, honorable composure. Despite the eccentricities mentioned above, I was impressed by the fight scenes, which are shockingly - yet appropriately - swift and decisive. With his blade drawn bare, Itt doesn't fool around: he kills with immediacy and precision, though he's often fighting such steep odds that the battles aren't over too quickly. A real jewel for fans of the genre, which storms through a few clunky patches and sets itself up to soar in later installments.",1488931200,,1366,5.242009132420091
