7956354,5,B00005Y6XD,"Not usually a fan of these types of movies since most are all the same and have bad acting and plots and directing but this one is a very good
action thriller. Fahey one of the best over looked actors in Hollyweird puts in another great performance. Eddie Hudson from ghost busters fame
and other movies is here too as a shady politician. Larry Menetti from Magnum PI is here and give his usual ok performance. Fahey is a former
govt agent taking a vacation on a train and runs into some bad guys. Good acting writing and directing make this a better than average thriller.
You can watch this on youtube aka Hijack. The quality is good but not as good as dvd.",1495756800,,659,4.32258064516129
