8074046,4,B000A3T8K0,"I always liked this mid-60's sci-fi.  An alien forces a scientist to start making duplicates of humans in order to dominate the Earth.  Richard Kiel, surprisingly plays a not too bad looking alien.  The effect are not great, but then this is definitely a B picture.  I have the VHS tape with the title Jaws of the Alien and the quality is not great.  Please, please, please, release a good re-mastered DVD very soon.  Recommended for so-bad-it's-good sci-fi fans.",1421539200,,463,4.7974683544303796
