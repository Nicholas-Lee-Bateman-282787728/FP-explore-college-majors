642297,5,6303422942,Better than the 2016 version. Please re release this forgotten gem on DVD for the whole family to enjoy!!!,1186272000,26,106,4.631578947368421
642298,5,6303422942,This is perhaps the best version of Jungle Book ever made. The cast is extremely charismatic (especially Jason Scott Lee who is not only an excellent action star but is so damn gorgeous that gay men will catch vapors just watching him run around most of the movie shirtless). There is excitement and danger and romance. What is not to love?,1186099200,,340,4.590163934426229
642299,4,6303422942,"A super production of 1994 that tried to recapture the magic of Kipling's novel. The emphasis is on the love Mowgli feels for Kitty, though we could not understand Kitty if she did not love Mowgli's beautiful body that he lets everyone contemplate and admire and his deep consciousness of the relationship between nature and man, between human fate and the law of nature the way it exists in the deep jungle of India. In other words she can only love this man who can speak to all animals and order them to speak or keep silent, especially when she looks at the officers of Her Majesty's army around her, human animals who only like killing, dominating, stealing and robbing. Vain, criminal and greedy as opposed to free, strong and generous. But by concentrating the film on this only love affair, the director and producers miss so many aspects of the book that are just as fascinating, like the detailed observation of human nature, of Indian society, of wild animals, of English men when their masculinity is at stake, and in those days their masculinity was always at stake which made them cruel in order to prove they were strong and human. It was a time when cruelty was part of a gentleman's education. This is mostly pushed aside in the film. And I must admit the elephants seem to be quite small in a way and the tiger should have been a lot  more ferocious. But you can't really shoot a film like that with wild animals. Too bad. And quite many small animals of the jungle are just absent, like snakes, bees, flies and all the other flying, crawling or jumping insects. The film is then only entertaining, but after all it is intended for kids, and even if we are grown-up kids, we are no longer wearing short pants in the office and going to kindergarten.

642300,3,6303422942,"Although ""Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book"" reminded me more of Tarzan than Mowgli, it is still a good film to watch with the family.  Jason Scott Lee  does a good job as Mowgli all grown up.  Cary Elwes is the perfect British jerk and Sam Neill has a decent supporting role.  Lena Heady and John Cleese have the most interaction with Mowgli, and they give the best performances out of the bunch.

The animal cast does a pretty good job as well.  Some of the human/animal interaction can be written off as fake-looking, but the majority of the scenes using animatronic creatures look reasonably good.

Young children may be turned off by the deaths in this film, and of Kaa the python, who makes a couple of brief, but scary to a five year-old, appearances.  Language, as well as dialogue as a whole, is kept relatively tame.  Neill and Elwes let off a few slurs, but nothing worse than the ""D"" word.

Overall, a decent adventure flick for kids too young for Indiana Jones movies, but who love adventure tales.  Another decent suggestion is ""The Phantom,"" starring Billy Zane.",1103673600,27,1077,4.645502645502646
642301,3,6303422942,I loved the lush scenery and Cary Elwes getting his snooty buttt kicked by Jason Scott Lee.  The clothes were great too.,1064707200,,120,4.454545454545454
642302,1,6303422942,"I'm glad I didn't pay more than 2 dollars for this DVD.
The story is absolutely not respected, nonetheless Kipling's work and message.
I watched a bad Disney's kids messed up arrangement, awful effects and decors, stupid play, and... should I spend more time writing about this ?
More fun were the comments by the director, finally saying between two jokes that he'd also been in ""The Mummy"" and sequels, so if you have the same feeling as I do about these holiday decorations (try putting the DVD on top on your Christmas tree) you'll understand what I mean about this unfortunate and totally wrong interpretation of the Jungle Book, what's more a movie I put aside after 20 minutes...

642304,5,6303422942,"The only reason I am giving this film 5 stars is that I can not give it anything higher. This film is far and away one of my all time favorite movies. I must have seen it at least a dozen times in theatres. I stumbled on JB totally by accident. On Christmas day 1994 I went to see Interview with the Vampire. Only to find that it had been pulled. Not wanting to make my trip to the theatre a waste of time. I decided to watch the Jungle Book. I braced myself for a silly childrens film. Instead I found a moving story, fit for all ages, about pure love, racism and colonialism and adventure.
The Jungle Book is about Mowgli (Jason Scott Lee) who, after a terrible mis-hap as a child, ends up growing up in the Jungle communicating with the animals. As an adult he becomes re-aquainted with his childhood sweetheart Kitty (Lena Heady) the daughter of a British officer(Sam Neal) in Victorian India and learns to become ""civilized"" again. Unfortunetly Mowgli crosses Kitty's then love interest (Cary Elwes). And a bunch of stuff happens which I will not go into for giving away the plot.
 I will say this though this is really, really an amazing movie. The chemistry between Jason and Lena is unbelivable. It really is what love is all about. Not once do they utter the ""L"" word towards each other but in every scene they are together you can see the bond and affection they have for each other. Also (keeping in mind that this is a PG movie) It is so refreshing to see a couple in love without them getting physical. Cary Elwes as the movies villain is really effective and subtle. He really is slick and charming-a real cad.
I would strongly recommend this film to lovers of the above.
This film became such an obessession of mine that I wrote out the novelization just to get it out of my system. Get this movie, it is a descision that you will not regret!",993168000,29,1857,4.367052023121388
642305,5,6303422942,"This movie is great - full of surprises and delightful scenes between a young British women and the rough jungle man she falls in love with.  There  are many funny scenes characteristic of traditional British humor, as well  as witty dialogue and lovely scenary and costumes.  This movie made me wish  I were a kid again and could still get away with watching only Disney  movies.  Also, Jason Scott Lee is absolutely gorgeous!",966902400,4,427,4.767123287671233
642306,5,6303422942,"I walked into the cinema ready to sleep through this one but an amazing thing happened , a Disney epic became one of my all time favorites thanks to the exellent direction from Stephen Sommers. He bends the rulrs of the  average Disney movie and makes it suprisingly violent (i.e quiksand moment  and the room filling up with salt scene). It's an adventure with an Indiana  Jones feel to it and the acting is great and Cary Ewles is briliantly evil  as the bad guy. Terrific!",960681600,30,475,4.488372093023256

642456,5,6303422942,"I bought a copy of this movie that was not for the USA region, because this DVD is hard to find, especially in the Region version for the USA, and it is very expensive in the version that is for the USA.  It won't play in my tv (and I knew that) but it does play in my computer.  My DVD player is about 8-10 years old, so it only plays Region 1 (which is the one that includes the USA) but some newer models will play all regions.  I'll get a new one soon and it will probably play in that.  There also hacks to make your DVD player play all regions, but I don't know how good they are or if they are safe for your player, so don't buy it in this region version if you want to play it in your tv and your DVD player only plays Region one.

Now, about the movie.  The location and scenery are fabulous, the cast play their parts excellently, to my way of thinking, but the story does not follow the book very much.  In this version, Mowgli's father works for an English officer and they are traveling (the officer and his little girl, Kitty, have just arrived and they are going to their new home) and a tiger (Shere Khan) attacks.  One thing leads to another and Mowgli is separated from the group and believed to be dead.  He finds his way, with the help of a black panther, to a wolf pack and grows up there.  Through an accident, he meets up with Kitty again and also with an evil young English officer.  Some people don't like this story but I do (and it actually has a lot of people who do love it) and I think the man who plays the adult Mowgli (Jason Scott Lee, who I believe is Bruce Lee's son) did a marvelous job of portraying a man raised by and with animals.  His range of facial expressions is impressive and he's not hard to look at either!  There is a lot of humor and some action, too, with a satisfying ending.  I have loved Rudyard Kipling's ""The Jungle Book"" since I was about 8 and my dad bought the book for me and, even though this movie departs from the book, I still find the spirit of Kipling's love of India and its animals, people and jungle to be in it.",1469491200,,2081,4.056234718826406

Jason Scott Lee was phenomenal as Mowgli, especially when he was working with the animals. He let his body language and facial expressions tell us what was going on instead of speaking. That takes talent and had to be difficult and I commend him for how well he did in this role.

The acting is fun, it has some emotional moments, it has great morals for respecting animals and not judging others just because they are different from you.

The snake is dated with special effects but that's what you can expect from an older movie. ;-) Lots of fun for a Stephen Sommers movie!! Love it.",1434326400,,516,4.329896907216495

They won't see it anyway, since this is a very hard movie to find.  I like it because it gives more depth to Mowgli and explains his backstory.  It show beautiful scenery in India and gives a sad and vivid view of the chasm between the rich and the poor in India during the colonial times.  Jason Scott Lee was great as Mowgli and John Cleese as the doctor.  If you liked the scene in National Treasure where the river of oil lights up, it came first from this movie.

The story is romantic and true to Kipling's book
with the animal actors carrying a lot of the interest.  The animal trainers were very superb, with friendship, cooperation and scariness
in the right proportions for a first rate film both for adults and children.  For this adult, it also shows the greed and self-service that a conquering nation always inflicts on the country invaded.",1392681600,,746,4.84251968503937

My father is a huge fan of the whole `talking animal' movies, and the plain old `animal' movies as well.  He just likes furry creatures, apparently.  Anyways, I was nine and I loved them too, so I was thrilled.  I have to say, this is not as joyous or as infectious as Disney's animated film, but it really is meant to be.  This live action flick is a much darker and harder version of Kipling's story, and while I agree with the reviews that mention this is more in line with Tarzan than Mowgli (I mean, Jason Scott Lee really works through this) but it is a fun ride nonetheless.  Visually this is rather impressive, and there are many sequences that are thrilling without being too scary for the kids.  Sure, some of the depictions (especially of Kaa) may be scary for the young ones, but it shouldn't be too much.

643282,5,6303422942,"I grew up a fan of the old cartoon but as I got older saw various version of this story. This one has the perfect balance of action and suspense, comedy and romance, and not to mention really cool live animal shots and awesome scenery.  Although the animals do not speak the careful narration in the film gives you a sense they really do have personalities.  Some younger kids might not appreciate the finer points in the film (man gives a woman a flower and kisses her) but for everyone of these scenes you see a mirrored scene which a kid can also relate to.  I first saw this Jungle Book when I was about 5 and really enjoyed it along with my little brother. who was almost 4.  For us at the time it had some scary scenes and now that I've seen it at my age (23) it still has a good element of surprise to it.  There are a few things the original disney story glazed over which this film actually enhances - such as when an old indian guide in the film explains to small Mogli what Baloo, Bagera, and Shar-Khan mean (in english Bear, Leopard, and Tiger) It is a very well made film with likeable characters and some familiar faces such as Cary Ewes (that black-masked man we all know in love in Princess Bride).

When I couldn't find the original film on amazon I decided to rent this one for my son. It was a poor interpretation. Even if you didn't read the novel it was only mildly entertaining. The premise of the Jungle Book is a young boy growing up in the jungle being raised by a wolf pack and befriending a panther and bear. This movie is a completely different story. The majority of the story shows Mowgli as a young adult. An asian american actor was cast as the indian man cub. The focus was more on Mowgli interacting with people than the animals which was a huge let down. I respect artistic liscence but the central themes and heart of the story was lost in this remake. I wouldn't recommend. Stick with the novel and the original Disney film and/or the touring musical currently at the Goodman in Chicago which is magnificent.,1374192000,,967,4.407821229050279

643341,2,6303422942,"As a child I enjoyed this movie a lot because I liked the cartoon Disney version and it was cool to watch a ""real people"" version. However, now that I'm an adult I noticed something critically wrong with the movie that no one else seems to realize or be bothered by.

The little boy in the beginning playing Mowgli is legitimately an Indian child. Well, in case you haven't noticed, he grows up into Jason Scott Lee who is anything BUT Indian. He is CHINESE. He doesn't even LOOK Indian! This made me lose all respect for the movie producers and I can't take it seriously anymore or enjoy it.

I mean really, who casts a Chinese guy to play an Indian man?? He looks COMPLETELY different from the kid in the beginning. It's not like there's a slight resemblance. There is NO resemblance.

I've heard speculations that it's because an Indian leading man is not as attractive to a female audience as a white leading man. However, Mowgli is not white so a Chinese man fits the bill better. If this speculation is true, then it is Hollywood ignorance at its best and deliberate racism at its worst.

Imagine my disappointment when I went to put the DVD in last night and discovered it was the Jungle Book with Sabu! I turned it off immediately. I wish I could return it because I know I will not watch it. I felt duped. If Amazon is going to sell something, I think that it's only fair that people know exactly what they're getting.

643403,5,6303422942,"Over the years I remembered how much I liked this film when I watched it a couple of times occasionally on TV, but never truly bothered really owning it, until one day I watched another sort of continuation to another well-known legend - that of 'Alice In Wonderland' made by Tim Burton, and suddenly I recalled the continued story of Mowgli, the jungle boy raised by Wolfs, that was made many years prior to the Alice adaptation, and I felt the need to watch this one again but this time with the eyes and point of view of a grown-up.
What's interesting about this version to the story is that the studios are of the same origin as they were in the case of the cartoon (don't get me wrong, I always liked the cartoon as well, but nevertheless felt something was missing there), Disney studios - and maybe because of that, the storyline about Mowgli who grew up in the jungle felt more loyal to me than the one that dealt with Alice the grown up girl who gets to visit Wonderland once more - since there's an evident Tim Burton atmosphere which rules every scene and moment - not a bad thing, if Tim Burton's direction is your taste. I, for one, always preferred the more natural and honest approach of the Disney films, without all the mystery and haze that are not truly required when wanting to watch a good movie.
Of course, this one is not totally innocent and naive like the Disney Cartoons tend out to be. Be prepared for a bunch of creative dyings here, violence and battles between the human characters and animals - by the way, there's an amazing taming work with loads of variety of animals here, which goes to show how much work and time were invested in order to create this simply fine result... I love everything there is to see in this one: the breathtaking views, the captivating animals, the well-fitted costumes of both the Indians and the English soldiers, I like the way the story flows from one fascinating scene to another that gives you no times to even start feeling bored - but above everything, I must cheer the casting of Jason Scott Lee, the actor in the lead role of Mowgli, the little boy who against all odds defeated the dangers of the Jungle he got stuck in as a toddler after getting lost, the boy who turned out to become one of the more impressive habitants of the jungle, fearless and strong, curious and kind but at the same time dangerous to those who wish to hunt him or drag him by force back to man civilization. I found this Mowgli to be instantly likable, reliable and more respectful to nature's laws than any man on earth could ever be.
Forget about the film's age, I'm sure you will hardly notice it was made nearly 20 years ago, as it feels fresh, exciting, full of life and hope and a wonderful adventure even today, and can stand up to any standard you'll come up with. This is one of the true achievement moments in Disney Studios history and if you even liked a bit the 60's cartoon movie - make sure not to pass over this marvelous continued story with exotic sites only India and her thick jungles can supply. The price? Well, for something as priceless as this movie is, I believe the money you'll pay to have it in your collection is not the issue here. Be wise, and hurry up getting it before it gets more lost than the lost city of treasure that appears in it. Enjoy the wild trails!",1360972800,3,3342,4.391935483870967

643501,5,6303422942,"This movie is quite good.  It has a very magical feel to it, and has some great shots of animals.  Furthermore, it has several solid performances and despite being rated only pg, has enough action to keep me, a huge action buff, completely entertained.  However, the best part of this movie is the message throughout the movie.  Sher Khan, who rather than a villain is portrayed more as like a jungle police officer, kills only those who disrespect the jungle law.  The jungle law essentially states you will not kill unless you are defending yourself or need to eat.  The movie states the message that people should not kill animals unless it is in self defense or for food, not for trophies.  I think it is a very solid message that kids should learn, and should respect.  Overall 5/5",1315440000,4,786,4.60431654676259

643586,5,6303422942,"This 1994 Disney movie and the much older version starring Sabu (first filmed and released to old fashioned movie theaters in 1942) are both excellent movie adaptations of Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book. A better version plays in my mind when I read Kipling's collection of short stories, complete with three dimensional living color and infinite point one surround sound, but there is a bit of a problem with putting it on a dvd and selling it to you. Until that problem is solved, you'll have to make do with what's currently available on dvd and a new Jungle Book movie now being made by the BBC, due out in 2010. Did I say make do? HA! Until the dvd that I recently ordered from Amazon UK arrives, I can only tell you about the Jungle Book I saw on tv. The colors were breathtakingly vibrant for standard definition tv, the sound was engaging (on my home theater system), the story was the sort of rip roaring adventure that Kipling wrote so well and not one single human or other animal decided to start singing. Yea! The animals all looked like wild animals in a jungle, which isn't always the case with jungle flicks. Well, except for the big snake. It looked more like rubber. But you don't see it for long. Ladies and gays will love seeing young, handsome, muscular Jason Scott Lee in a loin cloth as Mowgli, the jungle boy, now a man. I believe he was 27 or 28 when he made this flick, but he looks younger. Cary Elwes (main hero of Princess Bride and Robin Hood: Men in Tights, director of two episodes of Pinky and the Brain) made a wonderfully evil villain. The talented and beautiful Lena Headey (star of Terminator: The Sarah Conner Chronicles) is Mowgli's young love interest. Multi-talented John Cleese (Basil in Faulty Towers, Nearly Headless Nick in the Harry Potter movies) makes a great slightly befuddled professor. Sam Neil(Dr Alan Grant in Jurassic Park #1 & #3) makes a very good, rather stuffy British army colonel and father. I was so impressed by what I saw on tv that I just had to order it. There were two choices for getting it on dvd: pay a rip-off price at Amazon USA or buy it for about twenty bucks from Amazon UK, counting the exchange rate and shipping. Of course, it would be a region 2 PAL dvd. No problem, I bought a JVC all region dvd player with a built in PAL to NTSC converter 5 or 6 years ago to play PAL box sets of the oldest and best sitcom in the world: Last of the Summer Wine. (Well, I did have a sort of a dvd player that kind of did the job before that, but I'd rather not talk about it. Never buy a brand name you've never heard of, especially if it sounds like a cat sneezing.) Strange as it seems to me, some people don't care for Last of the Summer Wine. No accounting for taste. There are many tv shows and movies either only available in England or cheaper there. Can you find enough of them to make buying a special player worthwhile? If so, search Amazon and/or the web for ""PAL dvd player"" or ""code free dvd player"" or 'all region dvd player"". If you download the Web Of Trust and do a google search for code free dvd player sellers , you can check out the seller without even going to the website. At the website, a Better Business Bureau logo is always reassuring. Read the return policy carefully. Make sure the player you choose can convert PAL to NTSC. Some require an expensive separate converter. Buy a major brand name, not a cat sneeze brand. If that all seems like too much trouble, the cheapest used Jungle Book dvd on Amazon USA is fifty bucks counting shipping (as of 3/27/09). It's a wonderful movie but I'm not sure if it's worth that much. Then again, maybe it is. I'll add an update as soon as I've watched my PAL dvd a few times. In the meantime, why don't you check out Amazon UK to see if you can find any other good  movies or tv shows that are unavailable or more expensive here. Look up your favorite actors (of either gender) at the Internet Movie DataBase, then click on ""shop at Amazon"" on the left near the top. The page you're taken to will list all the actor's movies available or once available on dvd, and give you links to them on Amazon and Amazon UK. I just got an email that my movie is already in the mail and on it's way to me. The Jungle Book that I saw on tv was full screen, standard resolution and in stereo, but it still impressed the heck out of me. I'll add an update to this when I've enjoyed the dvd upconverted, widescreen and in surround sound.",1238112000,,4453,4.326555023923445
643587,4,6303422942,"This was pretty solid adventure story with colorful backgrounds of a the country of India and jungle scenery.

Jason Scott Lee as ""Mowgli"" is interesting to watch in the lead. Lee is an intriguing actor. He has an Asian background, but has played an Eskimo, here in Indian and other nationalities in other films. He is one of the more diverse actors I've ever seen, yet he isn't well-known.

Cary Elwes is usually effective as a villain. He has the acting talent that makes him easy to despise! The animals are fun, too, from Mowgli's friends in the jungle to the monkeys and giant snake guarding the lost caves with the treasure.

This simply is a nicely-filmed good adventure story for everyone. It's a shame it is no longer being made available to the public.",1235779200,,762,4.62962962962963

643590,4,6303422942,"I haven't read the book, so I don't know how accurate the film is, but I enjoyed this version of ""The Jungle Book"". It's all about a grown up Mowgli's struggle to fit in with British colonial society, after he is lured out (more or less) by Kitty, a girl he knew as a child before he was lost to the jungle, a girl who just happens to be the local Colonel's daughter. Her boyfriend, a British soldier called William, doesn't like Mowgli at all, but he is however terribly fascinated by the golden dagger Mowgli found in the jungle...

It's worth a look. Sam Neill and John Cleese are both in the film, and I enjoyed their performances, I usually do when they're in films. Jason Scott Lee as Mowgli wasn't too bad either, though I haven't really seen him in much else. The Indian location was a great idea, and added a unique flavor to the story. The one thing that bugged me about the film was the animals. I guess I didn't feel a really chemistry between Jason Scott Lee and the animals, which would have been nice, as that's what Mowgli is all about. But maybe that's just me. There is a sequel to this live action film which is about Mowgli's childhood, maybe that fleshes things out a little. I'll have to check it out...",1214697600,,1225,4.326086956521739

With regards to grooming and costuming of the actors and actresses, special attention was obviously paid to getting the look right for that period... whoever cast the individuals for their roles deserves an award!
