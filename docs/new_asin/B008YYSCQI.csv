8532909,5,B008YYSCQI,"I'm from Chicagoland and now I live in the Washington DC metro area. I wanted the video as a momental to stay connected with Chicago. After I seen the movie, and especially being an African American Business Man, I got the great sense of how great and powerful the movie is from a business aspect.

The video shows and tells you about the side of business that is not taught in the classroom. It hits the hardcore ethics and schemes of the real business world.",1388620800,4,460,4.411764705882353
8532910,4,B008YYSCQI,"This is a documentary about the club ""All Jokes Aside"" which operated in south Chicago from 1991-2000. The film starts with the owners who had MBAs in business and their desire to operate a classy African-American comedy club. The documentary includes stories about the staff, house MC, operation, and the comedians. The credits list Dave Chappelle and Bernie Mac in the credits, but Steve Harvey appears far more than they do.

There are bits and pieces of the comedians' acts, but it is not a comedy tape per se where we get to see entire acts. The film is funny at times, but more documentary than a comedy.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, N-word.",1368316800,3,643,4.732142857142857
8532911,5,B008YYSCQI,"This documentary chronicles the rise and fall of Chicago's ALL JOKES ASIDE comedy club.  It aired one afternoon during Black History Month in my local market on a commercial station.  I only caught the last 15 minutes and was intrigued, so I bought the DVD and WOW!  Am I ever glad I did!

The DVD is fast paced, thought-provoking AND funny, filled with historical clips and interviews with Kings and Queens of Comedy like Steve Harvey,  D.L. Hughley and Laura Hayes, but also features many folks who might not be household names but are equally wonderful.  You'll be glad to meet them.

The stars add comedic value (making this a hilarious documentary) but also move the narrative along in an important way.  The DVD covers a lot of territory, including segregation in Chicago and the unique challenges facing Black entrepreneurs.  Not only did I learn a lot about the state of Black Comedy in Chicago (and America) but I also learned a lot about the business of running a comedy club.

Highly recommended for anyone interested in Chicago, contemporary Black culture and/or the business of stand-up comedy.",1360540800,4,1107,4.871657754010696
