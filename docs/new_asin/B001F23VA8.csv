I would recommend collectors to wait for a proper release with English subtitles, because the movie has potensial. Inspired by Dario Argento's ""Opera"", ""Suspiria"" and asian ghost movies, with a haunting score, respectable special effects and a decent cast. I liked the story and the twist! The movie could have been edited a little shorter to it's advantage, but all in all a very good effort! Must own for collectors of asian horror! 4 of 5 stars!",1293926400,,604,4.8173076923076925
8300591,1,B001F23VA8,"the description says it has english sub titles heck the back of the box says it to but it does not, seemed to be an interesting movie to bad i didn't know what was going on

as for the movie im a huge fan of asian horror. movies iv loved are a tale of two sisters, shutter, audition, spiral...
this movie did not come close to any of those i wouldn't even consider it good the cgi is cheap and laughable sure i couldn't tell what they where talking about but i also couldn't when i watched shutter and i loved that movie it made me jump quite a few times",1233964800,,554,3.990990990990991
8300592,2,B001F23VA8,"Decent but meandering story. Some loose ends are left over even after the last 5 minutes of the film. Compared to her sisters ALONE and SHUTTER, BODY 19 really only excels in terms of special effects and make up effects, but lacks the uniqueness of the former or the eeriness of the latter.",1227484800,,290,4.490566037735849
