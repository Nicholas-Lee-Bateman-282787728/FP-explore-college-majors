8551328,3,B00AG9I3XG,The music and narration are way too loud and the train sounds are thin and flat.  The camera must have been mounted on a light duty tripod that clearly swayed as trains passed.  Would be nice to be able to choose a narration free version.  And it was expensive. Ho hum.,1399334400,,269,4.235294117647059
