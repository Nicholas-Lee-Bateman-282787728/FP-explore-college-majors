391137,4,6301942647,"'Dreams' is a strange film consisted of a number of short stories. At first, one might thought that Kurosawa was going to incorporate Japanese myths and legends as the theme of the composition (with the eerie 'Sunshine  through the rain' or even the rather modern 'Blizzard' episode of the  film), but as Kurosawa moved his composition further into the film, the  theme of LIFE emerged. Though he touched a rather bizarre combination of  questions in the different stories (some of them does sometimes seem out of  place, though this may be the case if the study of life was what he was  analyzing), Kurosawa was interested in the idea of life being 'short': not  eternal. From dead peach trees that lead to the discovery of a new one,  proposed suicide of a child, ideas of death and its appropriateness with  age, all the way to notion of death being inevitable, thus should be  celebrated (the last narrative of the film), this is a very complex study  for understanding the futile attempts of humans trying to improve life  through inhuman technologies, and a lesson in viewing the ambiguity of life  and its end. By the way, Scorcese's appearance in the film proved to be  quite interesting.",922665600,,1196,4.770731707317073
391138,5,6301942647,"In this late film (1994), the brilliance of Kurosawa's vision--both what he sees and his translating those sights into film--shows itself more simply and powerfully than ever before.  His wonderfully subtle touch with  the camera informs these beautiful and sometimes frightening vignettes.  Most memorable of all are those moments, so rare in contemporary film, when  Kurosawa allows the camera simply to capture the light of a beautiful  image--a peach orchard or a running brook.  For all the wonderful and  exciting cinematic thrills from Hollywood, this film reminds us that, in  art, beauty is still the best and the most difficult of artistic  achievements.",918259200,4,664,5.368932038834951

After reading an autobiography of Akira Kurosawa, Something Like an Autobiography, it was wonderful to go back and watch the DVD of this fascinating autobiographical film.

391188,5,6301942647,"This movie is such a departure from Kurosawa's previous movies that most critics gave it a bad review.  Don't listen to them, because this movie is not only has very consistent and important themes, it also is something of a sequel to the previous film, ""Ran.""  Like Ran, it is made of landscape shots using telephoto lenses, and it saturates the screen with colorful, fantastic images; but like Ran, it also is very slowly paced and not for audiences with short attention spans.  Some people would be eager to point out that the slow pace is meant to make the viewing experience more similar to a dream.  It appears that was the intent of the director in some of the dream sequences included in the film.

Anyone who has gotten this far should know that the movie is about eight dreams that the director himself experienced, but I'm not going to focus on them.  Instead, I will point out three themes that are explored in the movie.  The first theme is the relationship between man and nature: many of the dreams involve humanity violating nature and Kurosawa being forced to actively engage with nature as a consequence.  Others involve people who live in harmony with nature, but that harmony includes a caveat that is the basis of the second theme.  The second theme is an exploration of the reason to live, even though it will inevitably lead to death.  This theme picks off where ""Ran"" ended, where multiple strategies strike with no moral justification.  But whereas ""Ran"" argues that the universe is devoid of meaning and purpose, ""Dreams"" argues that the purpose of life its own ends.  Artists, farmers, and Kurosawa himself say at one time or another in the movie that life is worth living in its own right, that it is miraculous in itself, even though it ends in death.  The fear of death, the movie seems to argue, must not sully the joy of living.

The third theme may not have been intentional, but it involves the role of women in films by Kurosawa.  Women have gotten a bad rap in some of his previous movies, but in ""Dreams,"" most of the dream sequences involve conflict or tension between a female character and one of the male characters, including Kurosawa.  The conflict itself is not consistent, and it is dealt with different levels of catharsis in each dream sequence.  However, the dreams at least suggest that Kurosawa's relationship with or regard for women evolved over the course of his life.

In short, if you are a casual viewer you may not enjoy the movie.  But if you have a serious interest in film, and especially in Kurosawa, I could not recommend this film any more highly.",1461110400,6,2610,4.647058823529412

""The Peach Orchard"" is stunningly beautiful and poignant.  ""The Blizzard"" is harrowing, but has a good conclusion.  In ""Crows,"" Akira walks into Van Gogh paintings, which I love!  ""Mount Fuji in Red"" and ""The Weeping Demon"" depict hazards of radiation.  ""Village of the Watermills"" is a hopeful conclusion, despite the funeral procession by locals.

391247,5,6301942647,"Several things may arise when one thinks of the culture and tradition of Japan from Geishas, anime, and sushi.  However, for popular culture that meshes old and new, one person may stand out, critically acclaimed Japanese Director Akira Kurosawa known for the thought provoking films reflective of Japans samurai past.  For one of his last films 1990 Dreams Kurasowa takes an enormous influence from Japanese and Western art and literature and philosophy and religion with a dab of political and social overtones emerge as eight short films reflective of history, especially of Japan.

Dreams is a film that weaves eight short stories in one film similar to a piece of artwork on canvas.  And it is also with those stories that create a historic past that Kurosawa dwells upon within the stories from ancient relics to war torn and disastrous events.  Viewers may take a careful glance at each scene and the characters beyond the beautiful colors and costumes and display during the early vignettes of the film that invokes an enamored culture devoted to universal beliefs and symbolic imagery of relics of Buddhism and Shintoism; indeed, there are messages that are conveyed and in the tradition of international film, cinematography and the role of the actors are effective.  Without reading the English subtitles, much like art and the life like recreations of paintings of Monet and Van Gogh or Japanese wood block paintings of Hiroshige or Hokusais iconic Mount Fuji will definitely radiate. The highly displayed artistic expressionism and the expressions of the main characters that may not have spoken enough, speak louder than words can say.  All of the eight stories are worthy mentions but by far, the most moving stories come mid to near end of the film, especially the scenes of a World War II Japanese Imperial soldier that encounters a ferocious dog and a band of army.

Kurosawa to many filmmakers was an extraordinary director that may have been emulated by film students and aficionados.  But one of the highlights of most of films, he depicted humanity and nature in tuned in a creative way.",1436659200,2,2109,5.002857142857143

391405,5,6301942647,"SUNSHINE THROUGH THE RAIN: A strange and foreign, but beautiful and childlike look at Japanese mythology, with some gorgeous cinematography and more of Kurosawa's signature bizarre processions. A stunningly beautiful ending, and a great beginning to a fine film.

THE PEACH ORCHARD: By about 200%, the weakest dream of the eight. Without anything really much to say, preaching against man's destruction of nature, The Peach Orchard's soul saving-grace are gorgeous costumes and jaw-dropping framing. Typical Kurosawa work! Shoddy when compared to the master's best, brilliant compared to everyone else.

THE BLIZZARD: By a good distance, my favourite dream of the film. Three men labor with heart-rending exhaustion through a mountain blizzard; each step is an age, each breath a ragged gasp. Finally, they each succumb to the cold. The leader is awakened by a beautiful but simultaneously terrifying creature out of Japanese mythology. The man is begged to succumb to the cold, sleep, sleep, sleep. But he pushes on. I won't spoil anything more for you. This is a beautiful piece of cinema with a brilliant, absolutely STUNNING, mesmerizing soundtrack, and some amazing performances.

THE TUNNEL: In my opinion, the best dream of them all. Yeah, my second favourite, but certainly the best. Kurosawa's control of every detail is jaw-dropping; the sounds and ambient noise all make a sensory cinematic experience, but it is the moving human drama on display here, as a troupe of Japanese soldiers slain in war cannot understand their state, and the wandering Japanese colonel cannot give them solace. A magnificent performance, excellent cinematography, and tear-jerking emotion make this one the one to beat.

CROWS: This one is pure cinematic bliss. Martin Scorsese stars as Vincent van Gogh (yeah, read that twice if you have to), and this is art made cinema. Literally. A Japanese man wanders through Vincent van Gogh's paintings. A metaphor? A symbol of art and artists? Or just really visually stunning cinema? I am too entranced and captivated to tell you right now!

MOUNT FUJI IN RED: Words escape me; this is truly something that must be seen to be believed. Nuclear reactors have erupted, sending clouds of poisonous fumes over Japan. In one of the most terrifying, unforgettable, and haunting images in cinema, Mount Fuji is seen bathed in fire as thousands of people run panicking below. This is one of Kurosawa's most bleak and terrifying pieces of cinema. His trademark attention to detail and glorious cinematography is on full display here. This sequence haunts me to this day (ZERO hyperbole whatsoever).

THE WEEPING DEMON: I mentioned that Mount Fuji in Red was bleak. If that was bleak, this is a pitch black slice of hell. Oh wait, that's exactly what it is. The cheery title of The Weeping Demon starts out with preachy sentimentalism of man's destruction of nature, and ends with a searing, horrifyingly bleak and haunting view of sheer terror. The future is a post-apocalyptic wasteland where plants have mutated and those who have survived grow horns from their head. The weeping demons are truly a haunting, tragic sight. If you want to know how to end a short film so that the collective audience's jaws are resting on the floor, watch The Weeping Demon.

VILLAGE OF THE WATERMILLS: I don't know what to make of this. On the one hand, it's a welcome, peaceful and tranquil respite after the horror of The Weeping Demon. It's colorful, fun, and joyous. On the other hand, it's preachy and self-satisfied. In any case, it's a beautiful, atmospheric and lovely little ending to an amazing, completely original, completely mesmerizing and unforgettable film.

If you want to try something new, pick up this film. I don't think Akira Kurosawa is surpassed by anyone, and this is his most personal film.",1416960000,,3825,5.079617834394904

It's a collection of different dreamlike vignettes of great lyrical beauty and introspection. And after Fukishima the vignette about a nuclear disaster is unsettlingly prophetic.

No, the entire problem lies in the transfer to DVD...unbelievably bad, especially for a work of this acclaim and importance. The transfer is rife with video noise, is of poor resolution (though color seems fine), and is fraught with judder,mthe image shakes both horizontally as well as vertically, as if the film part of the telecine machine was on its last legs. In addition, the aspect ratio is wrong, it's been very clumsily pan and scanned to 16:9 and this O's one widescreen film that truly must be seen in the native aspect ratio.

Aqu en cambio Akira Kurosawa -a punto de terminar su carrera cinematogrfica- se adentro en el mundo de la fantasa, una fantasa artstica muy diferente de los productos comerciales y superconvencionales que al menos a mi ya me han aburrido por ser tan repetitivos: desastres, superpoderes, monstruos, etc.

Esta pelcula podra ser su produccin mas agradable a la vista por los hermosos paisajes que nos muestra, adems de ser muy relajante en ciertos segmentos y es que esta pelcula es una coleccin de sueos, tal y como lo dice el titulo.

So many were fabulous, along with Kurosawa's well-known hits, I would recommend Kuroneko and Woman in the Dunes especially.  But somehow, this particular film has stuck in my head most continuously.  Perhaps it was its fantastical beauty, perhaps the power of myth to stick in the unconscious, just as dreams themselves tend to do.

Dreams is not like any other movie I have ever seen, and likely the same for you.  There is no plotline, just vignettes of storylines that appear and disappear without resolution, some tapping Japanese folklore, some addressing modern issues of war and environmental degradation.  In this film Kurosawa was most frank about his moral concerns for our planet, aspects that elevate it above the merely entertaining.

Beautifully rendered, with allegorical social statements from one of the world's all-time greatest film makers.......who could ask for more?

391684,5,6301942647,"The general sentiment about this movie is that it is visually beautiful but lacking a coherent story. It's pointless, some say. I profoundly disagree.

There are movies that are purely escapist pleasure (""pointless""), there are movies that try to cram an overt ""point"" down your throat, and there are the precious few movies that neither try to please you nor make a ""point"" but rather put themselves at the service of images. This is one of those precious few movies. In it, Kurosawa puts himself at the service of 8 of his most compelling dreams, bringing them to cinematic life. He doesn't know what they mean, but he knows they're meaningful. As all art should be.

I saw this movie 4 years ago and it remains the movie I would least like to un-see. As a kid who was raised on 1990's American TV and movie culture, I had never seen anything like it. It lifted me into a land of subconscious images that is deeper and truer than anything you will find in a coherently-structured plot.

I thought many of the dream segments were so unusual, innovative and beautifully shot.  It's a very different movie as other reviewers have commented on, kind of like moveable art. I think my favorite of the dream sequences was the first one with the Fox Wedding on the rainy/sunny day called Sunshine Through The Rain. It reminded me of a Japanese Noh play except that instead of being set on a wooden, outdoor stage it was set on a path in a magnificent, old growth forest.  Everything about it was stunning and mesmerizing. My next favorite is the peach orchard/Hina dolls come to life dream simply called The Peach Orchard. Many of the dream segments seemed like they had deep psychological meaning and perhaps you have to be born in Japan to truly and fully understand the depth of some of them or the old myths and fables from which they spring. The segment called Mt Fuji in Red seemed almost prophetic on director Kurosawa's part given the terrible destruction of the 6 nuclear reactors in Fukushima in March 2011 and how many people died in the tsunami. I wondered what he would think of that segment in Dreams in light of what had happened in Japan last year since 6 was the number of reactors that blew up in this dream segment.  I don't know whether Kurosawa really dreamed these dreams the regular way or whether it was more like lucid dreaming on his part where he knew he was dreaming and could exert some control over the dreams but whichever it was the stories had such environmental and humanistic morals to be learned from each of them and the richness of each one is simply timeless. It will have you thinking about it for days after you watch it. A very beautifully filmed and inventive movie from one of Japan's greatest directors. Highly Recommended!",1337731200,3,1982,4.5

391687,4,6301942647,"I love the personal touches that are given to `Dreams', a film inspired by the actual dreams of the film's director, Akira Kurosawa.  Kurosawa made some astonishing films, and `Dreams' may be his most visually impactful.  It is, essentially, eight short films strung together through similar themes.  From the first short film (my favorite in some ways) to the final, stunning (visually and emotionally) punch to the heart, Kurosawa understands that these short films tell a tale that is important to hear and absorb.  As a whole, the collection works very nicely.  In parts, some stories work better than others and a few can feel stretched beyond necessity.  Maintaining an ethereal atmosphere (thus, the dream reference) throughout the entire film, `Dreams' truly lives up to its name.  From the epic depictions of fog layered hill tops (in `The Weeping Demon') to colorful adaptations of famous paintings (in the visual feast, `Crows'), `Dreams' will keep you glued to every frame; but it's the profound statement being made by the core of these dreams that will keep you thinking about it time and time again.

Anyway, this film is a collection of ""short stories"" supposedly based on dreams that Kurosawa had over the years. All the stories, like all dreams, are surrealistic and, of course, based on Japanese life and folk tales. However, for once, there are no samurais monopolizing the film, which is unusual for Kurosawa. Even if there was no translation of the dialogue the visual aspect of the film makes it worth watching, like a painting in motion.

391792,5,6301942647,"The film ""Dreams"", last full length feature of Akiro Kurosawa touches on enormous themes, and is visually exciting...

Broken down into several short films it captures the lives of different men, women, and children. Each scetch has its own unique setting, and is completely unlike the other ones in terms of the visual effects used. Kurosawa masterfully interplays the normal and the grotesque. Simplicity and fairy-tale. Despite - there s always a very very reach useage of colors, a palitte astounding to ones eye. Overall, it is a rather sad movie. Sad in in its thoughtfulness, presenting a stage of a director who has already passed a cusp of his prime and is thinking about his going as well as the more universal meaning of his life. That said, Kurosawa doesn't want his viewer to be sad. On the contrary he wants us to lit up and see the deeper magic of life..",1273536000,,869,4.6797385620915035

The movie ""Dreams"" depicts a series of ""dreams"", each as I recall it totally separate, non-related to the next and its own little world. And each one I found myself fully immersed in. I could detail each one, but I would recommend you watch it with no preconceptions, no ideas. Go into it with an empty mind is best.

Master of ""digital baroque nerdism"" the one and only cgi-director George Lucas may have cursed audiences with a few cinematic abominations during the decades following the Star Wars trilogy but he at least appreciated Kurosawa along with his master of the blockbuster buddy Spielberg.

391794,3,6301942647,"Some dreams make better films than others. Japanese director Akira Kurosawa's are no exception. ""Dreams"" (1990) is a decidedly mixed bag from the master, whose breathtaking visual style has not deserted him in these eight vignettes. The highlight is Kurosawa's astonishing journey through the paintings and landscape of Vincent Van Gogh (well-played by director Martin Scorsese) - a tour de force punctuated by its inventive use of color. However, the remaining stories pale in comparison to this mini-masterpiece. Kurosawa's anti-nuclear railings dominate two heavy-handed segments unworthy of ""The Twilight Zone."" Potentially intriguing episodes (such as a group of climbers trapped in a suffocating blizzard, followed by a ""night of the living war dead"" tale) emerge as sleep-inducing disappointments. Not all is lost. The first, second and last dreams are beautifully rendered ruminations on Kurosawa's childhood, nature and, inevitably, the graceful coda of death.

391880,5,6301942647,"There are eight dream sequences in the DVD. They are totally independent and do not have anything to do with each other, so each one is like a 'short story' yet they stand on their own as complete films and each one is told with the pertinent imagery, language and pace that is typical of dreaming. This is so well done that we feel at times we are either dreaming the movie or seeing a projection of someone's dreams as they happen. I do not know of any better rendition of the dream state in film, this is an extraordinary accomplishment and one of Kurosawa's greatest achievements. Yet we should also be aware that the subject of dreams is much more relevant and important within the Japanese cultural context than in ours. From an earlier date, one of their greatest literary novels is titled ""As I crossed a Bridge of Dreams"" (11th Century) and through the centuries to modern times it is a recurrent theme, that in the 20th century was best expressed by Yukio Mishima's main character in the tetralogy ""Sea of Fertility"" ,Kiyoaki Matsugae, who keeps a dream diary, which actually predicts the developments of events in the novel.

Here is the List of Dreams in the film:

1-A Peach Orchard 2-Mount Fuji in Red 3-The Tunnel 4-The Weeping Demon 5-The Blizzard 6-Crows 7-Sunshine through the Rain 8-The Village in the Watermills

I Have not listed them in order, The first is Sunshine through the Rain, a beautiful fairy tale seeing through the eyes of a child, which is the same theme of the second, with another tale, yet both are totally different. Each one of these tales is a separate dream, and like all dreams they have their own rules that only make sense there. The cinematography is masterful even by Kurosawa standards, for all the dreams, but particularly spectacular in these first two in showing simultaneously the nature of Japan, and the traditional deities of Shinto, Japan's ancient pagan religion that preceded Buddhism and Zen, and is still part of the country's cultural core.. Crows is about a gallery visitor that actually climbs inside a Van Gogh painting and pursues Van Gogh through the fields. Martin Scorcesse plays Van Gogh beautifully, this was like a fantasy trip. The Blizzard is about a snowstorm in the mountains involving a climbing team, and is more like a short hallucination that one of the mountain climbers has for a moment, before he wakes and continues climbing.

Mount Fuji in Red is the horrifying nightmare of several atomic plants that explode around the volcano, with fearsome yet beautiful impact. It is Kurasawa's commentary on atomic energy, which along with the 'genius' of Einstein has aged very badly in Contemporary culture. It is worth noting that he belongs, along with Marx and Freud, to a group of scientist philosophers from the 19th Century that really believed in progress, and the three have largely failed in 'changing the world' and have become instead clearly pass. In the age of ozone layer pollution, irreversible atomic waste, Capitalist Russia/China and Prozac, all these once grand hopes and dreams of progress have faded or evaporated altogether. The Weeping Demon is another dream that dwells in the post atomic, post modern world which has become a nightmare, and here Kurosawa goes back to the very beginning of film history to scenery reminiscent of Giuseppe De Liguoro's ""L'Inferno "", a 1910 film setting for Dante's Inferno that was extremely influential in establishing the iconography, and landscapes of the hellish universe, which looks very much like the world of the Weeping Demon. The tunnel is a war story that will be particularly touching to the military minded. It is Kurosawa's commentary on war in which a captain remembers his lost platoon, and they come back from the dead, first one man, then all of them in formation to be dismissed by him one last time. The Village in the Watermills is the closing dream. It is also a tale of nature and traditional values in contrast to the modern world, deeply philosophical and beautiful.",1250640000,3,4022,4.858600583090379
391881,5,6301942647,"Dreams is a profoundly personal film by a hugely significant filmmaker in the twilight of his career and life.  Akira Kurosawa was a wonderful producer, director, and screenwriter who created great films for fifty years; including such classics as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ikiru/dp/B00005JLMU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ikiru</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rashomon/dp/B00003CXC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rashomon</a>.  In fact, I would assert that there are arguably at least five films on Kurosawa's staggering resume that would be called masterpieces if created by even the most acclaimed filmmakers of today.  Dreams was made in 1990 and was one of his last movies (his final film being&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Madadayo/dp/B000059H7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Madadayo</a>&nbsp;in 1993).  It is important to note that I did not know who directed Dreams when I first saw it, but was just as impressed.

The film is apparently based on various dreams that Kurosawa had throughout his life.  The first is Sunshine through the Rain and follows a young boy who witnesses a kitsune wedding.  The second is called The Peach Orchard and takes place during Hina Matsuri or the Doll Festival.  A boy's family cuts down their peach blossoms before the festival and dolls from his sister's collection become animated.  The Blizzard follows snowbound survivors on a mountain whose will to live is tested by a mysterious female spirit.  The Tunnel tells the story of a dead soldier returning from war.  The Crows includes an appearance by Martin Scorsese as Vincent Van Gogh.  This stunning vignette follows a Kurosawa-like character that travels in and out of Van Gogh's paintings.  The nightmarish sequences include the apocalyptic Mount Fuji in Red and The Weeping Demon, which both no doubt touch on crucial cultural anxieties regarding nuclear technology.  Finally, Village of the Watermills ends the film with death, but also with jubilant celebration of life in general. I'm tempted to assume this is just Kurosawa's subconscious literally translated to the screen.

The images in Dreams are carefully symbolic and although they don't form one message at large, it does provide broad lessons and general wisdom.  It also provides some absolutely gorgeous cinematography.  I found it refreshing, even for Kurosawa, that the film's primary mode of communication was its visuals.  These images are beyond words but so few masters execute this medium flawlessly enough to actually pull that off.  This is not for everyone but I highly recommend it to anyone anyway.",1231372800,2,2719,6.015584415584415

I'll give it two stars.",1228089600,2,354,4.9491525423728815
391883,4,6301942647,"It always amazes me that folks always wax poetic about Akira Kurosawa and never seem to get past the director to get to the story.

Now I have to admit that I'm really into Japanese cinema, but this is a very artsy movie.  If you are looking for Yojimbo, bypass this.  This is not that kind of movie.  This is the kind of movie that someone with a liberal arts degree who enjoys visiting art museums might enjoy.  It is a bunch of increasing dark vignettes with a happy one at the end.

The first involves a 10 year old boy who sees a marriage procession who then is kicked out by mother and given a tanto (knife) and told that he has to kill himself.  Beautiful scenery as he heads into the field to beg for his life.  We don't (thankfully) see the outcome.  This was one of the happier vignettes.

We move on to a vignette that has a sick little boy talking to the personification of some peach trees that were callously cut down by his family.  While truly sad, this was a happy bed of roses compared to most of the rest.

The one about Mt. Fuji was just about as dark as dark gets, except maybe the one about the human watching the demons in hell,  Yea, this one involves 6 exploding Nuclear Power plants, Mt Fuji blowing up, and everyone in Japan jumping off a cliff or being overcome by colorful radioactive gas.  All the while the guy who caused it all lovingly describing just how bad, bad will get.  The Demons in Hell one seems to be a follow on with mutated flowers, devils whose rank is determined by the number of horns on their heads.  Good idea on the horns. I have no idea how many chili dogs it took to have these nightmares.

Their was a fairly happy one with a Japanese painter entering a Van Gogh painting, and the last one hearkens back to the Willoby episode from Outer Limits.  The Waterwheel village was truly the only really happy story in the bunch.  But then, if you like happy stories you probably are not watching Japanese movies.

Let's get real.  Most people will not like this not because of the filming which is excellent, or the tales which are dark but good, but because it might be considered a bit highbrow.  If you like artsy - go for it.",1221868800,2,2176,4.2689486552567235
391884,5,6301942647,"As usual with most things I love, this film is not for everyone. It is very much an ""art film"" and you have to like that sort of thing, but there are a couple of extra elements here that will separate the wheat from the chaff in whether someone else will ""like"" this...  Specifically, it's in Japanese (w/English subtitles), most of it is in ""real time"", and it helps to understand Japanese concepts of Nature (where living things such as trees have ""spirits"" inside them.)

Aparently director Akira Kurosawa kept a dream journal, and this film presents 8 such dreams that particularly affected him. Mission accomplished: this film effectively sucked me in and put me in the place of Kurosawa during each vignette. I presume that each segment's ending was when he woke up.

There is some powerful stuff here, everything from nightmares to simply surreal episodes straight from his subconscious. Kurosawa bares his soul to the viewer, and the effect is truly moving. One of them (where he's stuck in the mother of all blizzards and the situation is demonstrably hopeless) absolutely crushed me. I freely admit that other segments reduced me to tears. If a film can communicate its effects that accurately and vividly to the viewer, it must be doing something right.

Of the 8 dreams, 2 are ""so so"" though that's me as a Westerner, and at least I can see why they would have more import to the director. The rest of the film more than makes up for them with their power.

In all likelihood, you have never seen anything like this film, so that alone makes it worth checking out. It is certainly worth watching once, and I'd recommend watching it twice so you don't have the anxiety of knowing whether everything works out all right (or not!) hanging over your head.",1219708800,,1763,4.692556634304207

391888,2,6301942647,"This anthology of short films by the great director Akira Kurosawa based on his dreams reveals a deep concern for the relationship between man and nature.  As one would expect, there are many extraordinary visuals on display here.  The first vignette, in which a young boy enters the forest on a rainy day in the hope of witnessing a wedding of foxes, begins the film beautifully.  It is startling, mysterious, and fearsome; the boy can be seen as a representative of all mankind, intruding thoughtlessly on the natural world without care for the consequences...and unprepared for those consequences when they come.  Unfortunately, while the quality of the visuals remains high, the stories become increasingly preachy and obvious as the film wears on.  Only one, concerning a group of mountain explorers that has lost the base camp, approaches the quality of that stunning first episode.",1199577600,8,888,5.138888888888889
391889,5,6301942647,"There is a reason why this film has only four ""one-star"" ratings here (and, as those posts reveal, those viewers were ""unprepared"" for the work). Now, I assume if you are looking at this page you either have an interest in Japanese-studies or a curiosity about international film: both are preferable, but either will do. Still, those studying/involved with environmental-science may appreciate this work more than either!

When I first considered purchasing the film, I was seeking a break-down of the eight vignettes, since I did not locate any while skimming here, I thought potential viewers might appreciate one (even if it is just a more current version) (Warning: there is a breakdown at wiki, but it contains spoilers for each segment and does not thoroughly address cultural issues ... best to read it after watching the film):

---

1.) ""Sunshine Through the Rain""
-A young boy is cautioned against exploring the forest on a rainy day. Legend indicates that foxes have their weddings in such weather - and they must not be observed by humans. The warning goes unheeded ...
-There is virtually no dialogue in this segment. Instead, the sounds of both nature (rain and insects) and traditional Japanese music tell the story. It is both rich in color and beautifully shot. This segment is based on Kurosawa's own childhood memories.

2.) ""The Peach Orchard""
-The glistening raindrops of ""Shineshine through the Rain,"" we are brought to the floating peach-petals of this vignette ...
-Background: On March 3rd of every year Hinamatsuri (""Dolls Festival"") takes place. ""Dolls"" donning traditional Heian-period court attire are arranged on a red-draped, multi-tiered display (if you are interested, Google the name of the celebration to understanding the tiering system). On this day, one prays for the happiness of girls (there is also a ""Boys Festival"" on March 5th). March 3rd is also dubbed ""Momo No Sekku"" (or ""Peach Festival"") ...  and here is where the story begins.
-A young boy is serving his sister and her friends on Hinamatsuri. He brings the girls seven refreshments ... but there are only six girls. He insists that his count was correct and leaves the room confused. The seventh girl appears and lures him into a barren area which was formerly a peach grove. There he encounters the ""Dolls"" incarnate (note: the grove is divided into tiers like the display previously seen in the boy's home).
-The story stresses the destruction of the environment ... but a colorful spark of hope concludes this segment. Again, dialogue is restricted to only what is needed and traditional music accents this touching piece.

3.) ""The Blizzard""
-From the soft peach-petals of the last piece, we are brought to the cruel snowflakes of ""The Blizzard"" ...
-A team of mountain explorers have lost base-camp. They are frost-bitten, mentally despondent, and very near death. All but one member of the team is resigned to death. The one tenacious climber is visited by Yuki-onna who tries to lull him into a wintery-grave.
-Sound is at an absolute minimum here. The metallic clunk of the climbers' gear and the their labored breathing is all the viewer hears for several minutes. This creates a stark, foreboding atmosphere. A well-shot, uncanny segment.

4.) ""The Tunnel""
-The first of three nightmares, this segment features a guilt-stricken commander who was captured as a prisoner of war and then released. His entire platoon was ""annihilated."" He remains the sole survivor. The commander ventures through a dark tunnel. When he reaches the other side, he is ""confronted"" by his dead comrades (""confronted"" is a bit strong since they offer no threat).

5.) ""Crows""
-An all-star effort! ""Industrial Light and Magic"" helped bring this unusual vignette to life. Additionally, renowned director Martin Scorsese portrays Van Gogh (I would have never recognized him had the credits not listed him!!)
-At a Van Gogh exhibit, a man enters the artist's work. He seeks Van Gogh  in a French landscape ... looking for answers to his most pressing questions. A visual masterpiece.

6.) ""Mount Fuji in Red""
-A heaven of crows turns into a sky of radioactive clouds in ""Mount Fuji in Red"" ...
-The second nightmare. Mayhem ensues as it appears Fuji will erupt. Immediately, it is revealed that Fiji is not active ... but the nuclear power-plant behind Fuji has exploded. Purple, red, and yellow clouds of toxic death push Japan's residents to the shore. Where does one go when an entire island is doomed to a painful demise?

7.) ""The Weeping Demon""
-A plague of radioactive clouds turns into sweeping dust in ""The Weeping Demon"" ...
-The final nightmare. After the nuclear fallout, little remains. A lone survivor searches for hope. But, the landscape is devoid of life ... save giant dandelions and a horned demon.
-A most pointed exploration of humanity's follies.

8.) ""Village of the Watermills""
-As I hoped, Kurosawa leaves the viewers with a portrait of untainted nature. A man spies a village unspoiled by technology. A clear creek, flanked by wildflowers and frolicking children catches the attention of this traveler. He enters the village an learns about living in harmony with nature and the beauty of the ""cycle of life.""

While some find this work ""heavy-handed"" and improbable, it is crucial to understand this film as allegory. Moreover, I noticed a few complaints of recurring actors (that it hindered ""suspension of disbelief"" or some such nonsense) ... this is purposeful. These vignettes are interconnected and allegedly based on Kurosawa's actual dreams. Therefore, repetition would be ""logical.""

With just a little patience and a little intellectual curiosity, you will find this a film worthy of your time ... and, hopefully, inspirational. Highly recommended.",1196899200,6,5775,5.083421330517424

392007,5,6301942647,"Late in his life and career, Akira Kurosawa, whose star might have faded altogether were it not for the intervention of George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola (both ardent fans), gained a new audience and a new respect with a series of visually stunning colour films.  From 1975's saving grace ""Dersu Uzala"" to 1980's stunning ""Kagemusha,"" 1985's harrowing ""Ran"", we arrived at this gem in 1990.  Though I've long been a Kurosawa fan--starting with ""Kagemusha""--I somehow missed this one at the time, perhaps because the concept just didn't grab me.

17 years later and a recent rental through Netflix, I'm sorry I blew this one off before.  Other reviewers here have complained of the slowness of Kurosawa's work, long waits for any action.  Sorry it's not some bit of Jackie Chan or Jet Li chop-socky, guys; this is true cinematic art, which requires patience and tenacity (both of which are ultimately rewarded).  You want action, watch the ""Die Hard"" movies.  You want art, this is where you need to be.

These eight segments are some of the most colourfully vivid Kurosawa ever committed to celluloid--one of my favourite moments is in the first segment, right at the end where the little boy stands in the field of flowers under the rainbow and the mountains.  Nature's blooms in all their glory make up some of the most beautiful scenery anyone could photograph, and for Kurosawa's direction, that goes double.  Correspondingly, the sequence with the dead soldiers' souls addressing their still-living commander in the tunnel in the mountains is dark and grim, echoing the commander's state of mind at being confronted by old ghosts who are unable to accept that they are, in fact, dead and are trying to go home again.  ""Crows"" brings Van Gogh's art to life brilliantly (and significantly, includes one of only two examples in Kurosawa's body of work to feature dialogue not in Japanese--""Dersu Uzala"" was Russian, this sequence features spoken French and English--and Van Gogh himself is played unfailingly by Martin Scorsese); ""Mount Fuji in Red"" is genuinely frightening, the scenario of all Japan's nuclear reactors exploding at once the stuff of nightmares, as well as the following sequence with the mutant sunflowers and the horned demon-men whose punishment is to never die but suffer eternally.  The final sequence, ""The Village of the Watermills,"" brings it all together with its lush greenery, the philosophical old man, and the joyous funeral procession--its moral, to remember to respect nature, tradition, and live in peace with your fellow man.

A gorgeous masterpiece.",1187568000,6,2591,5.09692671394799
392008,5,6301942647,"I wish I were eloquent enough to convey just how much I loved and apprecciated the feelings this movie evoked in me when I watched it the first time.  Each dream or vignette is distinct and yet somehow connected.  My favorite was the 'peach orchard' segment.  It was so stunningly beautiful it brought me to tears.  The colors were unparalleled and the message was clearly yet sensitively conveyed.  It is not a movie with the traditional beginning, middle and end.  It is separate 'dream' sequences that fit together in an unusual but highly effective way.

392009,5,6301942647,"I first became familiar with the wonderful work of filmmaker Akira Kurosawa with his DREAMS.  It was a required film in my non-western art course.  For starters, many of these eight vignettes feel directly inspired and lifted out of Japanese screen art.  They start off in a very engaging way and then end very abruptly (not unlike real-life dreams).  They leave you wanting more and it is often pretty frustrating because you are just getting lost in the stories when they come to a close.  They are inspired by Kurosawa's childhood, Japanese folklore and Van Gogh's cornfield painting (among other storylines).  The short stories are brilliantly shot and the colors are breathtaking.  It's a shame that I didn't see this on the big screen.  If this is ever re-released in the movie theater, I would have to go see it!  In the meantime, viewers, please don't miss out on this film.  It's wonderful and poignant.",1182816000,2,912,4.825806451612904
392010,5,6301942647,"I was advised by a friend that ""Akira Kurosawa's Dreams"" were just a series of pretty pictures without much meaning.  I was prepared to just enjoy the cinematography but I came away with an appreciation of a kaleidescope of vision that tells of harmony with nature and one another.  I don't necessarily concur with the whole concept expressed in  the movie but I'd rather watch this than ""An Inconvenient Truth"" any day.

There are eight seemingly independent vision (dreams) that subtly tie together to give the director's vision clarity and impact.  The first story tells of the dangers of disobeying the laws of nature; even those we totally depend on cannot always help us when we break this taboo.  The second tells of the danger of destroying natural things that not only benefit our lives but improve the quality of it as well.  Once destroyed, natural treasures may only be found in dreams.  The third story tells of how man is helpless against the powerful forces of nature.  The fourth episode reminds us of humanity's self-destructive nature.

In a break in the logical process, the fifth episode reminds us of humanity's ability to create and understand beauty and harmony.  The path shown, in other words, can be altered within our own capabilities.  The sixth episode returns to the potential self destruction of humanity and the seventh shows how that same self-destruction can not only destroy ourselves but all of nature as well.  The final episode leads us back to a beginning point where, with a new attitude, the predicted doom and gloom need not happen.

All scenes are exceptionally well created on film.  The color, the impressionism, the gloom, all underscore Kurosawa's message.  Indeed, if you don't care for the message, don't skip this film.  Watch it to appreciate the technical talents of Kurosawa and his cameramen, artists, set designers etc..  Whether one is an adherant to the theory of Global Warming or other theories of apocalypse, it is hard not to appreciate the beauty of one man's artistic effort to make his statement.  It is coherent and profound unlike the politcal cacaphony of all sides of these issues.",1176595200,7,2149,4.935933147632312

392013,4,6301942647,"In ""Dreams,"" some of Kurosawa's most fundamental beliefs are presented to us in eight artistic and visually stunning vignettes.

The first dream, ""Sunshine Through the Rain"" is about a young boy who is warned by his mother not to go into the woods and look upon the wedding of the foxes.  The boy disobeys his mother and when the foxes discover that he has seen them they send a message to his mother that he must commit suicide for his transgression.

Kurosawa's pro-environmental stance is beautifully illustrated in the dream segment ""The Peach Orchard.""  After being laid waste by human hands nature allows an innocent boy to enjoy the beautiful sight of a peach orchard returning to full bloom once more, after which the orchard returns to its devastated state.

""The Blizzard"" is a story of human endurance stretched to its limits as one by one climbers caught in a blizzard on a mountain succumb to the storm and die.  Although it is a bleak story, the ""snow fairy,"" (probably death), appears to the last survivor and helps to guide him into the land of the dead without his feeling overwhelmed by the futility and desperation of his final moments.

An officer, the sole survivor of his unit, journeys home grief stricken after the war in ""The Tunnel.""  As he approaches a tunnel a ""snarling centennial,"" (dog), comes out of the tunnel towards him.  Afraid, but driven to continue on his journey, the solider enters the darkness of the tunnel.  As he exits he hears the sound of marching approaching him from inside the tunnel he has just left and is confronted by his dead comrades.  They are not aware that they are dead and the conversations between the living and the dead are heart wrenching.

In ""Crows,"" a visitor to an art museum enters the Vincent Van Gogh, (played by Martin Scorsese), painting ""Wheat Field with Crows.""  In an almost humorous scene, Van Gogh tells the visitor that, ""Yesterday I was trying to do a self-portrait, but the ear kept getting in the way.""  Soon Van Gogh is off traipsing through the landscape with the visitor trying to keep up with the elusive artist.  The colors and landscape we encounter in this dream are breathtaking!

""Mount Fuji in Red"" tells of the horror and devastation surrounding the people of Tokyo as nuclear plants explode releasing their deadly mother lode and there is no place to go to escape the situation, except into the sea.  Horrified citizens are in a state of shock and disbelief that their government had lied to them, having reassured them that ""Nuclear plants were safe.""

In ""The Weeping Demon"" man succumbs to the insanity of nuclear war.  The earth, as we know it, has been destroyed.  As a result of the high levels of radiation, the earth and its remaining inhabitants have mutated into what can only be described as a ""hellish"" nightmare.

And finally, in ""The Village of the Watermills"" a young man stumbles across a picturesque village and an old man sitting by watermills.  Technology has skirted around the village and the young man is in awe of the clean air and clean water.  The villagers' balanced lifestyle and their living harmoniously within the bounds of nature affords them long and healthy lives.  There is a funeral going on at the time of the young man's visit and the villagers are celebrating and joyful.

I loved this movie.  It is beautiful to look at and eloquently espouses some of the beliefs of one of the truly gifted directors of all time.  He was a man who deeply believed in tradition and honor, who took humankind's role as steward of the earth seriously; who believed that technology for technology's sake is not necessarily a good thing, and who believed war to be an abomination.",1171670400,6,3693,4.7296875

392089,4,6301942647,"I'm writing because I recently watched Akira Kurosawa's ""Dreams"" for the first time last night.  My father, about fifteen years ago, showed this film as part of a seminar series on film appreciation.  I had not attended it, but knew of its reputation.  It had just released when he showed it.  Although I didn't view the movie, I do remember one of the people who, after the movie ended, called it ""propaganda.""  I write this review because I, now, have seen the film and, having spent a lifetime paying attention to the cinema as an art form, feel more equipped to discuss that comment with some wisdom.

I understand more now about where he was going.  Personally, I think he's full of trash.  I get so sick of these idiots who are always trying to utilize self-interest in their opinions to stop others from making artistic expressions, or to foul-mouth an artwork to circumvent its internal message because it doesn't fit with the trend of business relations.  Just because Kurosawa's movie depicts a regiment of dead soldiers doesn't mean it's propaganda.  For someone to proclaim ""Dreams"" as merely propaganda is no more than just a way for that person to insert his own comment to pay no attention to the artistic value of the film.  It talks about what the writer (or auteur) feels about the confrontation with nuclear holocaust, about being unable to affect the social state through megalomania, but instead only through a personalized human angle.  That means Kurosawa is not a propagandist just because he mentions the deadly effects of nuclear holocaust like radiation and other diseases with which all of humanity should concern themselves as knowledge because he treats the subject from the human perspective without partisanship.  There is no partisanship in this movie.  It is simply a human angle discussing the thoughts of being confronted with something that would turn society upside down; in Kurosawa's case, it is nuclear holocaust and war.  It doesn't side with any politics or even talk about any politics.  It is simply a story with a human angle.  If that is a way to pass a message to people about nuclear war, then it's the viewers who invent that connection as a healthy relationship to their community or society.  In other words, it's a necessary story, like a fairy tale, and not merely propaganda.

The Nazis were good at labeling things, and so are the American neo-conservatives.  Can't such stupidity cease?  Perhaps it doesn't matter, since the movie exists whether any fool dismisses it publicly as propaganda even when it is not.  After watching this film, I believe most people won't be thinking ""propaganda"" when they leave the theater (or entertainment center).  They'll be thinking about Kurosawa, as a man, and about his thoughts.  Kurosawa has a right and a reason to make ""Dreams.""  The film is very interesting.

First, he was about 80 years old when he released this film.  If he talks about nuclear holocaust, or any other humanistic view, it's because he cares about teaching people about his personal mistakes and teaching people about his life lessons.  Eighty is very old, and it is much nearer the end of his life than it is to the beginning.  This was his last artistic film.  He died at 89.  If he were going to make any statement to the rest of humanity in retrospect of his life, it would look exactly like ""Dreams.""  Let's not mince up his meaning.

Second, he was Japan's greatest film maker.  Japan endured a nuclear holocaust which the United States brought upon it.  If an American says something like ""propaganda,"" he clearly doesn't understand and ""can't see the forest through [his] trees.""  Japan was a country of war in the forties.  Japan has had to live with its conscience ever since that war partly because the U.S. used nuclear war against it.  Wasn't Kurosawa a pilot in WWII who shot down several American planes?  He is thinking about how his life was affected by so many deaths in war!  After Japan's surrender in that war, their country has mostly become a country of what some would call nuclear conscientious objectors, a kind of conscientious objector most governments don't define as conscientious objectors.  The country is self-consciously against the use of nuclear war because they have had to learn a lesson about it the hard way.  That nation's largest director making a movie expressing his regrets in life through the depiction of nuclear war, or just war, makes sense as the feelings of an 80-year-old Kurosawa who expresses a retrospect on main landmarks of his own life.

Third, he titled his work ""Dreams.""  One must understand that this title is a designation to people who have not seen it.  It is an appropriate title because it summarizes the content.  If someone goes to watch this movie, it makes no sense to run out screaming a label like ""propaganda.""  If it had any effect upon its viewers, it's because of the human angle and it will be doing its job.  It is a faithful representation to only no more than precisely what it claims.  It is a good film, and therefore there is an audience for it.

I am so sick of certain irresponsible people who recklessly label a movie as ""propaganda"" any time there's a serious discussion mentioning war.  In a ten or fifteen minute segment of this film, viewers can completely relate to Kurosawa's intention and understand what is happening on the screen, partly because of its visuals and partly because of its dialogue.  However, this film is a little minimalistic, and this agrees with me.  This movie would not be any good if it were just a suspense film that treated nuclear holocaust like a casino crap out.  There's nothing to make fun in a statement like this and no reason for that, so why dramatize it?  I understand the feelings and expressions and correctly interpret them as Kurosawa's thoughts and concerns over major parts of his life, a.k.a. dreams.  I appreciate it.  It's just too bad more people can't stand to see when someone else can make such a keen and insightful work of art!",1156377600,12,6040,4.792836398838335
392090,5,6301942647,"With an eight-stories sequence, Kurosawa expresses the magic of chilhood, the importance of perseverance and resistance, the beauty created by Van Gogh, war and atomic menace unleashed spreading their horror, and, last but maybe most important, hope an joy when the travel finishes.

392091,5,6301942647,"""Dreams,"" by Akira Kurosawa is a beautiful and breathtaking tapestry of cinematic expression. These are Kurosawa's dreams, and what he believed were the problems facing man and his environment. I was lucky enough to watch this remarkable film at a theater many years ago in Los Angeles, shortly after its release. I was so impressed with the visuals in the film that they stayed with me for days. Weeks even! If you have not seen this great work of art, I would highly recommend you do. I have always found this film to be one of the most beautiful films in cinema. There are many visually stunning films around, but this film is in a league of its own. The colors are so impressive, one could easily call it a 'painting on screen.' I also hope that some day CRITERION will take this film and give their touch. Not that I am complaining with the present DVD. However, the film does deserve better, and would benefit from that magnificent CRITERION touch that it so rightfully deserves.

There are 8 episodes [vignettes] in this Kurosawa cinematic delight. Each are great in its own way. Moreover, they are ALL visually stunning and beautiful. Each have a story, yet all overlap with each other to some degree, and deal with mans disharmony with nature. Something that Kurosawa was deeply concerned about in his life. The film boasts some of the most wonderful and delightful colors on film that are sure to captivate you. Not to mention the stories themselves. The film is a visual painting on the screen. Everyone will have that one episode that they will like the most. And for me, that episode is the last one titled ""Village of the Watermills."" I wish I could find such a place! Maybe in my dreams? And of course, the perfect choice by Kurosawa for the role of the old man is played by the late actor Chishu Ryu, who starred in so many great films, and was a favorite regular in many of the films by the late great Japanese director, Yasujiro Ozu.

It was a delight for me to see Chishu Ryu in Village of the Watermills,"" my favorite episode, as Ryu was in the classic Yasujiro Ozu film, ""Tokyo Story,"" which has always been one of my favorite films. ""Village of the Watermills,"" is a great episode that I have watched numerous times. It is an episode that celebrates life. Death is a natural part of the life cycle, and I especially liked the way that Kurosawa shows us this in the films last episode. And more importantly, how this community, which is in harmony with nature around them, are celebrating the death of a woman who has lived a long and joyous life. There is no sadness, but joy in having known her. The villages occupants treat her death with celebration--as she has lived a long life. Plus, I am always amazed by the interaction with the traveler to this village and the old man (Chishu Ryu). When the old man is being questioned by the traveler, he seems so wise.

For example, when the traveler asks the old man ""Why don't you have electricity?"" The old man responds, ""Because night is supposed to be dark."" Or, ""If the night were bright you could not see the stars."" And when the traveler asks why there are no tractors for the farms, the old man replies, ""Because they have horses and cows to tend the farms."" Ah, such simplicity. If it were only so. Kurosawa was truly concerned about mans disconnection with his environment, and this episode of this quiet and tranquil village really hit home with me.

This is a series of mini-movies, all but one dealing with man's relationship with the environment. The exception is a love letter to Van Gogh's art with a fun guest appearance by Martin Scorcese.

Throughout each of these dreams, Kurosawa interweaves his vision with Japanese folklore and psychological insights into modern Japanese culture. Many of the themes in these movies are similar themes he's touched on in his earlier movies-- anxiety about the nuclear age, a need to respect history, a love for classic literature and fairy tales.

All of these stories are visually stunning, even though some are more emotionally moving than others.

A great way to finish his career, and a loving tribute by Spielberg to Kurosawa's favorite themes and style.",1154217600,12,983,5.2025316455696204
392093,5,6301942647,"With the title, Kurosawa has blurred the distinction between ""dreams"" and ""nightmares"" in this ensemble.  In fact, majority of what Kurosawa explores here are nightmares than dreams: the aftermath of nuclear explosions (twice), aftermath of a war, deforestation, and the likes.  Some ""dreams"" have explicit messages (Nuclear Aftermaths, The Village of Watermills,) some have implicit messages or just good as first rate narratives (Sun under the rain, the Van Gogh dream - excellent use of CGI in the latter).  Excellent cinematography.

What is consistently noticeable in all the narrations here is how quickly Kurosawa sets up the background and gets to the main theme, and how natural those backdrops are to the story!  A violently barking dog, at the entrance of a dark tunnel and the General walking into it is the backdrop for the ""Tunnel"".  In about five/seven minutes, this impeccable set up done, and Kurosawa rolls on with the episode.  It is left to your imagination whether the dog went and got the dead solider who does not seem to believe he is dead, or that the soldier appeared on his own.  Then the entire battalion of dead soldiers the General had ordered to the battle, all needing to be convinced that they are dead, arrive at the scene!  When the General convinces them all that they are dead, and as the sound of their boots marching backwards fades into silence, you are left wondering whether the General actually saluted them or was he really apologizing to them for the stupidity of the war, the responsibility he bore for their death.

The dog appears barking at the General again - perhaps the soldiers, as it is their Tannysonean duty to not question the General, did not dispute the consequence of his order, but the dog has no such obligations and is judging the General without prejudice!?

This is yet another nightmare that Kurosawa calls a ""dream""! This is one of the best in the collection.

On the downside, at places - though very few such instances abound - Kurosawa seems to lose control of the narration.  For example, in the Watermills dream, the vocal narration (dialog) tends to drag on and overshadow the effect of the visuals. Even showing the old man and the visitor from different angles to capture the Nature around them would have added additional value.  The nearly still camera adds to the monotony of the situation as the old man goes into a long conversation.  ""Village of the Watermills"" is probably the lowest ranking one among all the episodes in the ensemble.

Some dreams seem to end prematurely - Kurosawa seems to deliberately not make statements where he easily could have.  But then they are supposed to be dreams and the endings of dreams are abrupt! And with such strong story line backed up by such narration, he does not need separate statements - the narration is the statement!",1146355200,11,2846,4.835051546391752

It's a message movie that comes across as a tongue-lashing of our evil ways. The photography is stunning, but the stories themselves are lacking in narrative force.

392185,2,6301942647,"What a disappointment. I am being very honest. Based on reviews herein, I thought this was going to be a visual masterpiece filled with stunning imagery and a poetic journey for the mind. Sadly that is not what this film is. There are far more, dare I say greater Japanese films that will fill your heart and mind. I agree with an earlier reviewer (scroll down), I think that many people have latched onto the idea and popular notion that ""this is great film making"" because an academy may have chosen to honor an aging film maker some 15 years ago. This typically happens with ""foreign"" films being reviewed by Westerners for whom appeal lies in that which they think represents the culture or community or creative prowess of the foreigner.

I am writing this review from Japan where I live and I can assure you there are several astounding works out there that superbly capture the essence of Japan whilst both visually and emotionally challenging the viewer. The ""moral lessons"" contained within the vignettes of Dreams (honor your elders, respect nature, value tradition, be a good person) are so trite and transparent, and forced upon the viewer in each of the short segments that to me it felt more like an assembly line of Japanese Aesop's Fables. In short, I am not convinced that this film has withstood the test of time (okay well 15 years at least) to captivate and intrigue and challenge the viewer. If you are truly looking for something palatable from Japan which will make you think about life, values and human relations, I recommend Kikujiro or Spirited Away for that matter. Those are both places to start if you are new to Japanese film and would like to be inspired by truly excellent contemporary story telling the Japanese way.

By the way, the fact that Spielberg and Lucas helped produce and that Scorcese appears in this film is pretty much a red flag that it is probably not great Japanese film making at its best.",1132012800,21,1941,4.689149560117302

A testemony to the collective cinematic memory, this film ranks in the higher ends of cinema as an art form. A look should be done to the sequence dealing with a dream about Vincent Van Gogh.

Two dreams ""Mount Fuji in Red"" and ""The Weeping Demon"" do not make the historical leap, however.  They are interesting ""period pieces.""  ""Mount Fuji in Red,"" an anti-nuclear piece, is mired strident views of its time - not rising to the more universal threat.  Note, however, that ""The Tunnel"", an anti-war piece does continues to powerfully express its views.

""Crows"" which is based on Vincent Van Gogh's work, shows Kurosawa adapting Western imagery to his Japanese work.  This is a wonderful piece that illustrates how cultural divisions can be bridged by film, film relying primarily on visual (rather than verbal) material.

You are left to interpret your own ""moral of the story"" and regardless of the unusual role play, the vividness of imagery and imagination he creates is worth watching.

392194,5,6301942647,"""Sun Under the Rain"" is the first short film in this ""movie."" As rain cascades onto a slate gray house, a young boy is told he must stay home. Soon his curiosity compels him to wander in the forest. The sunlight filters through mist weaving its way through the giant trees in layers of enchanting vertical art. At times the rain appears like glitter against the wet rust bark. There is a sense of mystery as the young boy hides behind a tree and watches a fantastical wedding procession. Upon returning home he is told he must face his fear and ask forgiveness (or die) for watching the fox's wedding procession. We are then rewarded with fields of flowers and a rainbow.

This is the first in a series of eight short dreams that seem to be dealing with various elements of death. In the first movie, there is a choice between death or asking forgiveness. This introduces the idea of death and in the next short film about a peach orchard, the idea is taken one step further. The peach orchard is cut down and this introduces the idea of death in nature. Tree spirits discuss their tragic end with the child and dance in four magical rows where the trees were planted. As a child cries over the loss of the peach blossoms he says: ""Peaches can be bought. But where can you buy a whole orchard of blossoms?"" The first two films contain magical elements to surprise and delight the inner child.

The Blizzard and Avalanche will try your patience at first, but as with many of the films, your patience is well rewarded. Just as we are losing hope, a snow goddess arrives and seems to be an angel of death lulling a climber into sleep, as if to calmly steal his soul while the wind whips her hair in an erotic dance of nature. As he lays covered in snow, she places layers of what appears to be a magical shawl over his shoulders. She keeps saying things like: ""The ice is hot."" I kept thinking this was a study in hope and yet the elements of death were very present. Expect the unexpected in this section.

The Tunnel brings us to the concept of fearing the unknown or not accepting our death. The walking dead appear and there is a sense of having lived an unfulfilled life or dying for causes that were not worth more than life itself. This is when Akira Kurosawa starts to delve into political aspects and death's stark reality in war. Another film shows the dangers of nuclear power and Mt Fuji glows with a ruby shimmer and seems to be melting. The images of the demons in pain gave me nightmares the night after I watched this movie. The images of blood-red lakes and demons, in what seems like emotional and physical agony, was enough to make me dream about hell. In fact the night after I viewed these short films, I had many ""short film dreams"" of my own.

One of my favorite sections is ""Crows,"" where an artist steps into a Van Gogh painting. The film has many surprises, but very little plot. Mostly we are viewing two painters walking through their own art and discussing their view of the world. Crows is much more about visual delight and a surprising ending.

""The Village of the Watermills,"" takes place in a picturesque village complete with a dreamy river and little bridges. Here death is celebrated and life is revered. The water rushes over long flowing underwater grass growing from the riverbed. We are faced with questions about our modern reality. Is it as comforting as living in a village? Is our modern village somewhat lacking in community? Do our funerals focus too much on our sorrow and less on the celebration of a life well lived?

I watched this twice and noticed quite a few new elements on the second viewing.

I want to go sit by the river in the Watermill village and watch the long grass weave back and forth in the water and the child in me wants to be walking in the front of the funeral procession, tossing flower petals in front of the dancers.

392256,3,6301942647,"This is definitely not one of Akira Kurosawa's masterpieces.

As its title suggests, the movie is a loose series of dream-like vignettes that echo some of the themes in AK's previous films, with stylized bits of autobiography tossed in. These ""dreams"" are arranged in rough chrono-biological order, from childhood to manhood to old age; in between we get scenes of war and environmental catastrophe. Sprites, ghosts, and demons abound. The supernatural elements are reminiscent of Masaki Kobayashi's Kwaidan, from which Kurosawa probably lifted his Snow Maiden episode.

Sure, there are some striking images painted in gorgeous hues, but the whole affair is curiously uninvolving. It's also painfully didactic. Two of the dreams, ""Red Fuji"" and ""Weeping Demon"", are dated, simplistic, Cold War-era anti-nuke polemics that reminded me of nothing so much as those cheesy Godzilla flicks, minus the campy fun. (Perhaps the cheesy effects are Kurosawa's little tribute to his former AD, Inoshiro Honda, who directed the original Godzilla.) The last dream, ""Watermill Village"", starring the usually subtle and superb Chishu Ryu, is a kitschy luddite fantasy about the perfect little ecotopian village. Okay, I'll admit that this quaint little ""village"" is the epitome of bucolic loveliness (in real life--as opposed to ""reel"" life--it's a popular tourist trap, part of the large Daio wasabi farm in Nagano prefecture). But Ryu's wise-old-man schtick is just too damn corny and preachy in this scene. The upshot of all these dreams is: science and technology are bad (mmmkay?), modern man is arrogant and stupid, we should return to medieval village life and learn to live in harmony with Mother Nature. Kindergarten Taoism, in other words.

The sophomoric, heavy-handed Dreams is such a comedown from Kurosawa's wonderfully subtle, multi-faceted masterpieces of the '50s and '60s. Frankly, this simple-minded bagatelle is a little embarrassing coming from the towering cinematic genius who gave us Ikiru, Seven Samurai, and Red Beard.

Kurasawa's dreams will work their way into your own.

There are moments of horror, brutality, fear, nostalgia, wonder, sadness and joy. The great thing about Kurasawa is his ability to create a cinematic world in which these feelings are experienced by the sympathetic viewer. I think of these short stories as fairy tales for adults, and the film produces a childlike suspension of disbelief, an acceptance of wonder, and a willingness to be led to truth by beauty.

Fairy tales are saturated with mythical achetypes that carry important cultural meaning, and many have a universal appeal to deeply-held belief systems and values. The universal appeal of Kurasawa's work is directly connected to his understanding and use of mythical archetypes. Even when translating a story from a Russian author and plopping the characters down in Edo-period Japan, or setting a Shakespearean  drama down in Japan's feudal countryside, it is Kurasawa's depiction of the universal in the particular that makes him both a great Japanese director and a great world director.

The last is about an adult who visits a utopian village of water wheels.

 I think they're pure movies because the visual content is so strong that if they were translated to any other venue, even the stage, they would probably fall apart.

This film is an over-exageration regarding the many problems, and positive aspects, of the human race.  With contrasting settings and open expression, I believe that no other work by Kurosawa has been this personal.  Moreover, it has to be his best film later in his career, right next to Red Beard.

392358,5,6301942647,"Kurosawa's Dreams consists of all his worries about the world and human beings. Since it's one of his last works, his mentality of filming ""the Dreams"" differed from films such as Seven Samurai in the zenith of his filming career. Instead of presenting the fierce fighting scenes, which he had excelled in, he put more effort into the internalized understandings of human beings, expressing naivete, confusions, struggle, losses, enthusiasm, despair, anger, fear and ultimately internal tranquilitythe natural way of life. It is like a life circle.
If you look at Kurosawa's life, these dreams actually imply his own mentalities from childhood and youth to old. The young artist in the movie, who experienced the Crows, Mount Fuji in Red, the Weeping Ghost, and the Village of the Watermills, is himself. As a young man, Kurosawa majored in Western Art, and was greatly influenced and fascinated by Western artists such as Van go. His obsession with art at that time is obvious as ""he"" was running through the Van go's works. When I was watching the Crow, I was amazed by the setting of the scenes and his capability of shooting, making every aspect look exactly like Van go's work! Kurosawa is a truly versatile director, surely among the rare ones that have such grounded foundation in fine arts. Comparably, he is not as versed in music as in art. I'm especially amazed by his nuanced choices of color in his colored films. (I will talk about the use of color in Ran later, hopefully.) During the precarious time in Japanese history with wars and political movements, as an aspiring educated young man, who witnessed so many human disasters and stupidities, he got somewhat frustrated yet more angry. The characters in many of his ""dreams"" condemned the inhumanity brought by H-bombs and nuclear missilesthe big disaster took place in Japan during WW II. It reminds me of his other movie ""I Live in Fear"". If we look back on his earlier movies, we can see that the main string of Kurosawa's Dreams is a retrospect of ups and downs of his life as well as a summary of many topics in his other movies.
In the end, Kurosawa presents to us an ideal word, out of any form of industrialization, out of any artificial intentions and religions. The world he describes in the village of watermills, a village without a name, (since names themselves are artificial), is the world that is believed in Zena belief that was greatly influenced by Taoism (the path) originated in China believing that human beings should live in a harmony of nature and keep of mood of harmony. ""End the thinking (unnatural intention), end the pain,"" is commonly cited in Zen. This revelation of living life as its original form is where Kurosawa found his internal tranquilityin peace. This is also a sincere advice from an experienced old man. The last scene, as the water wheels goes round and round, life goes on and on as an endless circle.",1080864000,5,2916,4.79920477137177
392359,3,6301942647,"Kurosawa's Dreams is a collection of short films that work as part of a whole, but like all collections some films are far inferior then others. The film is Kurosawa's most personal and several segments are a bit heavy handed and indulgant. The segments that worked for me were among the best of Kurosawa. The Peach Orchard with its mysterious mood and breathtaking color is a highlight. The Tunnel with a powerful performance by the actor playing the officer is a strong and simple reflection on war. Crows is a stunning segment that recreates and uses effects to lead its character through the paintings of Van Gogh. The weakest segment is Mount Fuji in Red which uses poor special effects to tell an awkward cautionary tale. The other segments are intermitantly interesting, but really aren't that striking. If it was anyone else the film would be a masterpiece, but for someone of the caliber of Kurosawa it is simply good.
Video: If you enjoy the film or are a Kurosawa collector you are in for a treat with this stunning transfer of the film. It is very sharp and clean with good detail in the shadows. What knocked my socks off was the color which is rendered beautifully. It is absolutely gorgeous. A great transfer.

392366,3,6301942647,"I read & heard so much about Akira's last masterpiece.  I watched his earlier offering in the form of ""Ran"" & many of my friends told me that ""Dreams"" was heaps better as it's a more personal & heart-felt works of the Director.  Compounded by the fact that this is also Akira's last work, I told myself that this is a must-have collector's item.  When I watched this movie, I could understand why Steven Spielberg & Martin Scorcese liked Akira's work so much for its subtle & abstracted messages that screamed out quietly ""Humanity"".  All the short stories were beautifully taken & at times, I would gaze at them with bewilderment.  At times, the scenes seemed to drag on forever but perhaps, that's Akira's intention to captivate our attention through the protracted silence with anticipation.  I found the experience exhilarating & puzzling at the same time.  The only downside of this movie would be that the final four short stories all talked about the same topic, about our callous nature that eventually destroyed nature & civilisation.  Furthermore, I questioned Akira's idea of using the same actor for different short stories.  It's quite interesting to see Martin playing the part of Van Gogh instead of directing a movie.  All I can say is that watch this movie with an open-mind.  For visual treat, don't miss this but if you expect a fast pace & direct movie, you would be disappointed.

392447,5,6301942647,"Eight dream-like stories that touches on everything from a childhood fantasy about a witnessing a fox wedding in the forest to post-apocalyptic nightmare of mutants and cannibals. Some very powerful stuff but a couple of episodes got too preachy when Mr. Kurosawa is exploring his nuclear-war anxieties.
Some of my favorite pieces:
The Tunnel: A weary Japanese officer is walking home from a POW camp at the end of WWII. On the road, he comes upon a dark gaping tunnel, from which the ghosts of his dead soldiers emerge and haunt his conscience. It is hard to forget the image and the sound of a platoon of dead soldiers marching with relentless military precision, gradually emerging from the inky depth of the tunnel like bad memories welling up unbidden.
Sun Under the Rain: A boy ignores his mother's admonitions to stay in doors on a day when rain is falling on clear sunny sky. He ventures to the woods and witness an odd procession of fox spirits. It may sounds like fairy-tale yet the story takes a disquieting turn. The last images of a rainbow striding across a lush valley are beautiful almost beyond belief, but all that beauty is tempered by the uncertain fate of the little boy.
Crows: An art lover step into Van Gogh's paintings. Your eyes will think they died and went to heaven.",1066262400,6,1295,4.684210526315789
392448,5,6301942647,"Akira Kurosawa's dreams are better than mine.  If this is what he saw when he closed his eyes, then I can understand how from that mind sprang the Seven Samurai and the rest.
""Dreams"" is maybe the most personal, most ""Japanese"" of Kurosawa's films, and along with that it is perhaps the most difficult one for Western audiences to appreciate.  This is saying nothing against Western audiences, but many of the themes and myths on display may not be familiar, and the imagery and metaphors may be lost without the appropriate background.  I definitely appreciated it more after living in Japan, and becoming familiar with the countries folklore and literary story-telling style.  Hina Dolls, the Yuki Onna, the mountain villiges like islands of tradition amongst concrete modern Japan...
""Dreams"" is beautiful, on a purely visual level.  The cinematography is exquisite and the colors and light are displayed with the eye of a painter.  It is appropriate that Van Gogh plays a role in one of the many dreams.  Like Van Gogh, the stories in ""Dreams"" are expressionistic and vivid, yet with the subdued emotions that is the hallmark of Japanese literature.  This is not the wild, raw statement of a younger Kurosawa.
Story-wise, the dreams play with the themes of death and loss, both human and of nature.  The displacement of Japanese forests, the lack of safety standards at nuclear power plants, the loss of traditional Japan, the pointless loss of lives in war...melancholy themes at best.  Yet at the end, hope is offered, in a small nook and cranny, like a flower blooming amongst concrete.
The DVD itself is a small disappointment, and I would rather have this belong to the Criterion Collection, but better to have it than not have it.",1063670400,99,1740,4.907849829351536

I thought this movie was really slow it seemed to drag on and on.
For example, lots of times somebody is walking to a place, or just standing still for minutes long, and you could get the point
after 30 seconds or something.
The visuals of the movie were ok and sometimes very original, the effects I remember the best were the of the man walking in Van Gogh paintings.
The stories are filled with various lessons and philosophies about live, but somehow a lot of this felt cliched.
I think I understood the deeper meaning of most of the stories, but it failed very much to impress. It was as if I had heard or read these lessons about the destructivity of the human species
for example, lots of times. That's my main reason, I seemed to already know that, and now somebody is repeating it for me in some dreams.",1061683200,3,926,4.3895348837209305

The Dreams shows us how destructive humans are towards the nature and ourselves. Kurosawa criticizes the past, the presence and the future.
Kurosawa (not the real kurosawa) plays in every Dream, from when he was a child in Sunshine through the Rain to when he is old and visits the Village of the Watermills.

The dream sequence is pretty much in every single film made at this point, but no one dared to make an entire movie out of a dream sequence, or sequences as Kurosawa did. Cinema has always had its boundaries pushed forward, but more people need to think outside the box. If there are no rules of reality in making a film, then make the film acording to a reality that doesn't exist. That is what Kurosawa finally was able to do at 80 years of age, and more people will start using this movie as a reference tool to further go into their souls. As for the DVD itself, it is pretty bare-boned, but the low list-price makes it a very clear decision on what will become a classic masterpiece.

392454,2,6301942647,"This DVD is a series of vignettes.
Most often, the vignettes have the protaganist coming into contact with some natural or supernatural force or person.
There are a number of visually striking scenes, but often they are sandwiched between bombastic lectures on the dangers of technology and nuclear power.  The scene of the 6 nuclear power plants all exploding at once was particularly funny.  Frightened people running around in front of a flaming Mount Fuji backdrop that is so two dimensional and fake that it looked like something from a High-School film project.  I expected to see a guy in a Mothra or Godzilla suit jump out of the flaming crater.
The ""blizzard"" sequence was similarly distracting in that the snow and terrain are so fake looking that it was hard to feel very worried about the poor mountaineers.
Many of the sets and effects were very reminiscent of the old Star Treck sets.
The dialogue and story lines have no subtlety at all.  You simply get the impression that the director is taking advantage of the captive audience to introduce you to his world view.  I'm all for movies with a deep message (and I share most of the views espoused in this movie), but there is no subtlety at all in this movie's presentation of it's agenda.
If you want to see a truly beautiful and engaging Japanese movie with a similar theme, watch Princess Mononoke.  Dreams is simply a waste of time.  It's a lecture on Kurosawa's pet philosophies, masquerading as a movie.",1050019200,8,1474,4.734375

392456,4,6301942647,"I finally got online after a while and went poking around and stumbled across this DVD just in an off chance.  I was almost completely shocked and amazed to have found it listed.  Finally some of Kurosawa's best movies are coming out of Limbo.  I have read some recent reviews of this new DVD, and hope it isn't quite as bad as they say it is as far as the widescreen and picture quality go.  But of course I am not going to get my hopes up.  I have had this for many many years on VHS, and managed to track down a copy on Laserdisc, just before DVD's for anything ever hit the market.
To just make it brief on the review of this movie in general, this is a brilliantly artistic series of short stories, by a super brilliant movie maker.  Years ago I had fallen in love with many japanese movies, and Kurosawa has always been a favorite, and almost never disappointed (even my discriminating and picky taste).  If you have never watched much foreign movies, try to remember to keep an open mind and follow along as best you can.  And watch it again and again to try and catch more things.  Some sequences you may not like a whole heck of a lot, but others will surely touch your heart.  I only wish Kurosawa could have been encouraged to have made many more of these.  The world has truly lost a great visionary of great japanese culture.
To tell you a little of what has been going on with some Kurosawa movies, at least in what I have observed.  As near as I can tell, their must have been some problems with Kurosawa's properties when he passed away a number of years ago.  Soon after his passing this particular movie Dreams (among some others), disappeared from the market anywhere on VHS or Laserdisc.  And for years after that nothing was heard or much known what was going on.  Because of this instance, the VHS was off the market for quite a while, then sort of reappeared.  But mostly as a Rental copy...
Hopefully now that this has hit the market, it means more of his properties have been released for the general market, and if this DVD copy isn't the best thing around, we can maybe get together and encourage some places (such as Criterion) to look into getting a super great version put out some time in the near future.
Oh, and one other thing.  I would have easily given the rating a perfect 5 (which is what the movie itself deserves), but from the reviews of possibly being a bad copied DVD version, I felt I should knock it down to 4.  Hopefully it isn't as bad, but like I said, if it is, hope springs eternal that someone else will get the rights to it and make a super great copy like this so deserves.

392504,4,6301942647,"I saw this ""movie"", Yume, which is more like a collection of 8 shorter vignette type cinematic experiences based on the dreams of Kurosawa, some good some nightmarish, on the whim of a self-confessed 'intellectual' friend from Tokyo. The first time I went through the whole DVD with a very open mind but failed miserably to see the exalted direction or deep meaning that a Kurosawa movie is supposed to convey. Although I did notice the stunning visuals.
However, I have seen this movie about 2-3 times since, and I truly believe this is one of the most beautiful films ever made. I guess Japanese ""art"" may be growing on me a bit because a lot of their writing and filmmaking would seem to a non-native as a little, er, pointless. This movie, too, is characterized by extraordinary photography, and long periods during which very little occurs. There is no plot as such - a series of eight situations (dreams) which are virtually tableaux. From time to time people do things like dance in a stylized Japanese manner for a very long time.
A fare of this genre is perhaps not for everyone, definitely not for the masses because the masterly cinematography carries a lot of the story and Hollywood has brainwashed most of us into needing a lot of dialog or action. If that's what you're after, you won't find it here. But I am sure it will make you think about life.
Among other things, it has commmentary on war, the environment and the fragility of the earth. Overall, a very effecting and in the end hopeful movie. My DVD was still in original Japanese (I had expected it to be a dubbed version) and what little dialog there is, is subtitled for the English speaking viewers. The imagery though is absolutely lyrical and transcends language or geopolitical borders! Needless to say, I am smitten with Kurosawa and have since seen IKIRU, RASHOMON and DERSU UZALA -- grand films by a master film artist.
One parting word of advice -- this film needs to be seen in the letterbox format as it was intended.",1048464000,5,2003,4.629213483146067
392505,3,6301942647,"Being a great fan of the old 1991 Laserdisc version of this movie, I was excited to finally hear that a DVD copy was available. I purchashed it right away in hopes of showing off my progessive scan DVD player (with component hookups) and my snazzy new 16:9 widescreen 46"" Sony HDTV. Sadly, this DVD version's quality wasn't anything like I remembered.
10 years ago, I owned this movie on the old Laserdisc format, and the quality was unbelievable. The colors in every segment seemed so perfect, so sharp - that the movie was almost surreal in it's presentation. It just jumped out at you with impossibly perfect reds and stunning blues. I remember loading this Laserdisc when friends came to visit and I really wanted to WOW them with the ""new digital laserdisc"" technology.
Sadly, it appears this DVD version is a transfer from an inferior, analog source. The widescreen complaints from other reviewers confirm this suspicion. Sure, the DVD looks good, and sounds good, but just doesn't have the impact - color/picture/etc - that the original did. Film grain and dust specks are clearly visible throughout the movie and most edges are fuzzy. My 4 year old DVD of West Side Story is sharper and more vivid than Dreams. I can't stress enough that this DVD seems to be more of a transfer than an actual remastered version of the original.
This DVD reminds me of the Goodfellas DVD transfer, which was also released years ago without any significant DVD bonus features or, more importantly, an enchanced digital transfer from an original copy.
Perhaps I'm being picky, but I remember Dreams as being both a wonderful movie *and* a fabulous technological showpiece for my home theater system. Now it's just another DVD in my collection, looking as technically ""good"" as Animal House or Heat. Hopefully Criterion will release an enhanced, completely remastered version of this fantastic film in the near future.",1048204800,18,1906,4.904024767801857
392506,3,6301942647,"Ok, the box reports ""Anamorphic Widescreen""... But the screen aspect - which hadn't been respected already on LaserDisc edition - has been even more trimmed down in the DVD edition. The DVD aspect ratio is only 1.8:1, while when released on screen the aspect ratio was 2.35:1!
I already checked out if they used the entire frame of the Super 35mm original and it was not the case, as the DVD has fewer image details and lateral image compared to the LaserDisc edition. Alas!
The sound is very good but comparable to the LaserDisc edition.
Finally, the DVD has no extras at all - something disappointing, as Kurosawa declared at the time of theatrical release that the special effects available at the time were used to their maximum extent. And that he wouldn't commit other three of his dreams to the screen because there were no sufficient SFX at the time to allow this.
A rather disappointing release. At least, the movie is beautiful, but I'll stick with the LaserDisc edition.",1047945600,71,981,4.742690058479532
392507,4,6301942647,"Although not the flawless masterpiece everyone claims it to be, Kurosawa's Dreams is a strong final statement from the brilliant Japanese director. Although he would continue to make films after Dreams, this is the closest Kurosawa came to creating a masterpiece that rivals his best work. Consisting of 8 segments, Dreams is almost like a series of interconnected short films using variations on a theme.
Although the writing and all the performances aren't quite up to Kurosawa's best, they don't diminish the poetic power of this wonderful film. In many respects, the ruminations on man's place in the world, our finite existence and our poor understanding of our surroundings make this Kurosawa's most personal film. Often overlooked by film fans, Dreams is finally getting its due now that it has become available in the superior DVD format. The videotape couldn't do justice to the fine compositions and beautiful use of color. Kurosawa's strength as a director was always his carefully cultivated use of the visual as narrative. What we see and how we organize it visually, makes up the narrative of our lives just as strongly as what we say and do.
The support of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg (no matter how you feel about their films and careers)is what allowed Kurosawa to remain vital and creative towards the end of his life. When many in the Japanese film industry had turned their back on this master film director, Lucas and Spielberg (along with Scorsese)allowed him to make a number of minor and major films at the end of his career.

392577,5,6301942647,"To better experience Kurosawa's best film, it helps to understand the context in which the script was written. To many Japanese people, either because of their Buddhist or Shintoist religion, or because of the many childhood stories they have heard, the world is alive with spirits. These spirits could be described as angels by the Christian ethic, but much better as jin by the Muslim ethic. Jin describes them better because jin are not necessarily good or bad. Similarly, kami are spirits which could be good or bad depending on the situation.
Virtually every one of the individual dreams in the movie has these spirits. Understanding that what you are seeing on the screen is not supposed to be a person -- it is supposed to represent a spirit helps empower the film. In some segments, it is obviously -- the storm woman from the dream on the mountain is clearly not human. But in the peach orchard, realizing that the girl never was intended to be human -- she represents the spirits of the peach trees -- both in an individual sense in that she could be one peach tree and in a universal sense in that she represents all peach trees everywhere or the idea of peach trees in the abstract.
Historic Guilt:
The extreme amount of guilt that Japan as a nation felt after WWII is expressed in the tunnel. This extreme guilt may be hard for some non-Japanese to believe because the Japanese government has not made as many public statements as other nations, such as Germany or even the Catholic church about the Christian Crusades. The Japanese sense of guilt is a powerfully internal event that can not be discussed openly. Seen in this light, the tunnel dream is overwhelmingly powerful.
There are no Mountains with Mercy:
In any given year between six and 18 mountaineers die in the extreme wilderness of the Japan Alps. Few people associate Japan with extreme mountaineering. The Alps are relatively short -- 3,000 meters mostly, but the construction of the mountains is rugged, sharp towering walls of granite -- formed by volcanic action and showered down upon by more than 100 inches of precipitation annually. Winter mountaineering is very dangerous and avalanches or whiteout snow storms are an ever-present threat. For Japanese, having grown up with the news reports of teams lost while climbing, the dream on the storm could well be a personally touching segment.

392579,1,6301942647,"After reading the video cover I wondered how one man can sum up our dreams, but Akira Kurosawa sums up our worried dreams (if not all dreams are worries).
There is a visionary visual glimpse into what might happen with our nuclear situation, with demons feeding off each other and realistical portrail of horrific chemicals. Childish innocence is shown in the opening 'dream', man's strife and wars are visual treats along with Martin Scorsese as Vincent Van Gogh. But Kurosawa does not leave the train of thought unfinished. He shows us an idelic simple living that makes surprising sense but it is something moderns will have difficulty swallowing.
As in early Kurosawa films the stories are there leaving us to wonder but his last works are visual contemplations of this hellish world. The lack of conversations may leave some fidgeting but look beyond smallness and understand.",990489600,2,881,5.041095890410959

My favorite one has to be the ""Peach Orchard"" or the ""Wedding of the Foxes"" wich is also known as ""Sunlight Through Rain"". Personally I would never see this movie dubbed.

I am dissapointed in those critics who can't imagine the medium of movies having value unless they are built around a fast paced linear plot line.  These are the same people who probably think poetry is a bunch of rubbish and ""Finnegan's Wake"" is an unreadable waste of time.  I hope and pray and fantasize that the studio that owns the rights to this movie will release it in greater numbers, drop the price, and (glory of all glorys) release it on dvd.

That is, the cinema is where I can go to touch my emotions, all kinds of emotions, sometimes finding those I never even knew I held undiscovered.  'Dreams' is that wonderful kind of film which allows me the freedom to drift from one feeling into another, in a way I'm not capable of in reality.
After a lifetime of mastering the art of visual storytelling, it is Kurasawa I'm forced -- not forced, for it's a pleasure, how about ""immutably drawn?"" -- to respect, to honor and to listen.  It's difficult to explain this sensual piece with those I love, considering its limited availability, but I take some guilty pleasure in knowing its beauty and that it's shared with so few.

Anything about Japan just seems to draw me, but anyway... at that age I was listening to the Three Tenors. I remember distinct parts to the movie... the peach orchard, the female spirit helping the near-dead mountaineers, the walk through Van Gogh's paintings, the bomb.... and the encounter afterwards between a human being and a man mutated by the radiation of the blast. A lot of this moved me, and it inspired me into writing one of my earliest poems which I used for an assignment in school.

392624,4,6301942647,"This movie is a transferral directly from the realm of dreams to the realm  of screens.  The challenges of how to faithfully render a dream world on  film would seem to me to be quite hard to overcome, yet Kurosawa creates  magic on the screen.  The film can be slow as some dreams are less  intriguing than others, however that only accentuated its veracity, as some  dreams run away with you, and some dreams get stuck in a rut or a circle,  and most dreams are frought more with anxiety than with plot.
Even the  dreams I didn't enjoy so much seemed familiar to me as I was able  throughout to see and hear the images and symbols and characters as if I  were dreaming them up in my head and not just seeing them on a screen.  The  execution does not at all seem effortless, but nevertheless perfect and  brilliant.
Dreams have a way of symbolizing something surreal within you.  That is what this film invites you to do, delve into your own subconscious  - to find the meaning of the dreams, to find a subconscious connection  between yourself and Kurosawa, and with all of humanity.  The  cinematography is beautiful.  The imagery is chilling.  The music is  perfectly selected to contribute to the film.  The stylized movement  enchantingly expert.  If you enjoy movies such as Jacob's Ladder, Ran, or  other movies that use film imagery as an art, if you have a tolerance or  even enjoyment of symbolic material, you must watch this film.
Be  forewarned, some of the scenes toward the end get a little preachy, which  is a clumsy addition to an otherwise wonderful and magnificent film.
Now  I will indulge and say The Peach Orchard was enchanting and delivering and  The Tunnel was grippingly powerful.",968457600,,1709,4.615384615384615

For those who have yet to experience his films, I urge that you hold off viewing this until you see most of his older films. I really don't think  that this film works very well. The three best stories are ""Red  Fuji"", where a nuclear power plant meltdown leaves some terrified  survivors; the one where a traveler stumbles across a nuclear-mutated demon  (one assumes this is a direct sequel to ""Fuji""); and the last  one, in my opinion, the most beautifully filmed, ""Village of the  Watermills"". In it, an old man preaches to a young traveler about life  and death. Like the ones I mentioned, the other stories have excellent  cinematography (maybe the best Kurosawa has ever done -- what with the  vibrant colors and sweeping landscapes), but the problem is, the overall  experience is too disorienting. Kurosawa had difficult getting this one  made and had to call for help from George Lucas (who's Industrial Light  & Magic did the special effects) and Steven Spielberg. It's clear why,  because studios had difficulty understanding the unity of it. Many of  Kurosawa's hard-core fans enjoy this film, but I personally didn't find it  to be all that exciting.",949104000,4,1235,4.814285714285714

392673,5,6301942647,"One of Kurosawa's strengths as a sensei/master of cinema is his political use of the medium. Dreams, while nothing short of visual spectaculars, gives us a moral perspective of the artist through his luscious dreams.  There are anti-war (""The Tunnel"") and anti-nuclear power  vignettes (""Mount Fuji in Red"", followed by ""The Weeping  Demon"") and concerns about environtal conservation (""The Peach  Orchard"".) There are other goodies as well: Japanese folklores meet  the wild imaginations of young Akira (""Sunshine through Rainbow"";  the brilliant ""Blizzard"") and the preachy ideals of an old man  most reviews here comment on (""Village of the Watermills.)
What I  treasure, as a Kurosawa fan for life, is the very personal glimpses the  film allows into the older Kurosawa. It gives me terrible shudders to hear  Van Gogh (an okay performance by Scorsese) say, ""I don't have much  time left to paint."" But it is comforting to reach the film's end and  listen with Akira Terao at the centenarian's suggestion of ""happy  funerals"", if only to know that the sensei does not reject this life  he so scrutinized with a critical eye in his art -- that he is at peace.",927331200,23,1162,4.984375
