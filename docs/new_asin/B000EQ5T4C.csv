8112793,4,B000EQ5T4C,"For all motor racing enthusiasts this is a must buy, particularly for all V8 supercars fans. At just under 2 1/2 hours, it showcases all the highlights without being too long or too short. All 13 rounds are given equal exposure, along with all the crashes and action sequences. My only complaint is that the Bathurst round should have been focused on a little more, and drive through penalties should have been explained a little clearer. I will definitely be buying 2006 highlights.",1162512000,,483,4.831325301204819
