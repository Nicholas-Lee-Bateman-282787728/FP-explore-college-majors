4049097,2,B0031DRZEC,"All movies get kitsch after a few decades, but this movie had that quality from the jump.  This was made in the 1970s, so it's full of loud clothing and furniture.  The actresses have overdone makeup.  There are turtlenecks and butterfly collars too.

Still, other flaws are purposeful and specific.  Though not related, every actress in this had reddish-brown hair.  When the film's title comes on the screen, ""Lesley"" is spelled differently from the disc cover.  Every actor has bad timing and the script is terribly weak.

I wonder if the director Joseph Sarno and hottie Sonny Landham have beef with each other.  The disc description calls Sonny a ""B [movie] favorite.""  On Sonny's website, he does not include this work in his filmography.  Still, he is on the cover, though he is not the main male actor.  Then again, they don't list his name on the front cover of the disc.  At one point, he wears an Elvis outfit which must be a reference to his incredibly low voice that sounds like the late singer.  Most importantly, you get to see more of Sonny than you do in any other non-adult film, if you know what I mean.

Actually, every man in this film has an adult industry background.  I wonder if this is why they were comfortable in exposing themselves as much as the actresses did.  Too bad more actors don't take their lead.  There is much girl-on-girl action here.  This is decades before it become a major trend.  Still, it is more about titillating straight men than empowering lesbians.",1146700800,20,1500,4.652671755725191

4049101,5,B0031DRZEC,"An excellent collection of Joe Sarno's films from the 70s. Abigail Lesley tells the story of a sexy girl returning to her old town, where she then seduces all her old friends, and helps an enemy to become a friend. The other film in this two pack is Laura's toys. Here, a bored wife meets up with her old schoolchum , and gets it on with her husband's assistant. I will add that this one was shot in Sweden, and the landscape is perfect. I can recommend both these films, as both have stood the test of time well.",1457568000,3,513,4.191919191919192
4049102,3,B0031DRZEC,"One of Sarno's wife's favorite movies. Very erotic, not ""x"" rated (""MA"" if was on cable).  Slow by today's standards.  OK overall, attractive actors and interesting side subject (archeology) but nothing to really grab you.  Though not explicit could tell the actors were really enjoying themselves (what Joe would direct them to do).",1457222400,,333,5.245283018867925

4049114,4,B0031DRZEC,"The movie is from the 70's, and the picture quality and the sound are both excellent.  Looks like they went back to the original film to create the DVD version.  There's enough of a story to tie the scenes together (notice I didn't say plot).  Both movies have a mix of characters who are either hesitant in their sexuality or full blown addicts.  In the end, everyone does everyone, and the pseudo-sex is both beautiful and convincing.",1390089600,15,436,4.623376623376624

4049116,5,B0031DRZEC,"I give this one 5 stars in the erotica zone.  It doesn't always show all the ""bits and pieces"" but is still very satisfying.  Laura's Toys is equal to, or better than Abigail is Back.  I believe its the sequel to ""Confessions of a Young American Housewife"", which is also excellent.  Enjoy!",1359072000,3,290,4.519230769230769
4049117,3,B0031DRZEC,"As a person who lived on the 70s, it is funny to see movies that talk about the sexual trend on that decade;  even when do not totally agree.

In terms of eroticism, the movie is dated. It was considered ""X"" but there French and European movies like Happy Few or many others considered for ""ALL PUBLICS' that are far more explicit.",1356393600,5,331,4.32258064516129
4049118,2,B0031DRZEC,"I've seen a few of this drive-in type movie, but these two are just awful.
There is hardly any dialogue, and at times the 2 actors just look at each other with no expression. which at first was funny. The intimate sceens were flat as well.
I really expected more and was disappointed.",1350864000,2,284,4.377358490566038
4049119,2,B0031DRZEC,"Bought Abigail Leslie is Back in Town from Amazon. Com after researching IMDb Review and in particular KEYWORD Content,but regret to say that the movie bore little resenblance to the IMDb information. For a movie perporting to be Arthouse Sexploitation it would struggle to qualify as Softcore, and particularly in view of the strong porn star content. I strongly recommend avoiding this version of the Movie on DVD from Retro Seduction Cinema Presentations.",1333065600,7,458,5.287671232876712
4049120,1,B0031DRZEC,I found this to be a total waste of money only because it did not deliver as advertised. The films have been censored down to the point that it was less erotic than a late night movie on HBO or Showtime. Poor acting and horrible sets were to be expected by the age of original films but the editing truly lowered the quality of the production to where I was very disappointed.,1322092800,4,376,4.236111111111111

4049122,3,B0031DRZEC,"Joe Sarno is merely a name in this one. He's not true to form in my opinion. If you watch these two movies after ""Butterflies"" You will be slightly disappointed. There's more attention to movie/plot and the sex leaves much to the imagination. This was late night HBO. There is a balance between Hardcore and R. These movies failed to capture retrocinima and the seduction was missing. Some breasts, but not more than that.

4049123,5,B0031DRZEC,Lots of full frontal shots and realistic sexual scenes.  I enjoyed this movie from the start.  I thought it was worth the money.  I have no idea what the plot is about... I was too busy looking at nude women every other minute.,1310342400,27,227,4.232558139534884
4049124,5,B0031DRZEC,"Abigail Lesley is back in Town was a great movie as so was Laura's Toys. I'm a fan of Joe Sarna movies because he doesn't hold back anything I mean anything, I'm a huge fan of Jennifer Welles which was one of the main reasons I purchase this dvd.",1290470400,13,246,4.040816326530612
4049125,4,B0031DRZEC,"If your into Joe Sarno flicks this may be of interest. Abigail Lesley Is Back in Town has been available for a while but Laura's Toys has been in hiding unless you wanted to pay higher than acceptable prices from sellers that have it. With this gathering of two movies under one roof with the beautiful Rebbeca Brooke in both and a price tag that is very reasonable you've got a winning combination. Now, if they would bring out MISTY....",1276732800,9,438,4.4875
4049126,4,B0031DRZEC,"Abigail Lesley has a reasonable plot, and certainly has nudity if that's what you are looking for. Rebecca Brooke is very easy on the eyes, and the other actors are acceptably attractive (cannot say this of All The Sins of Sodom). The acting is relatively good save for a few attempts at profound deep thinking out loud (cannot say this of All The Sins of Sodom). I must have missed the plot of Laura's Toys, but it is interesting to see Rebecca Brooke play the two different personalities in the two films.

If this is considered erotica, I find it difficult to distinguish these films from hard-core porn; admittedly there are no erections or insertions filmed. But I have no idea how the scenes were filmed without the activity being real, and certainly the sex scenes were vicariously arousing. There are many very realistic all-women scenes, with lots of women! Laura's Toys overused one spoken line; it will be obvious when you begin hearing it, and it's probably the least needed phrase in the movie.

So the writing for both films is somewhat weak, but the filming is excellent with an attractive cast.",1274572800,57,1110,4.746113989637306

8386938,1,B0031DRZEC,"It's a love story which centers on Priscilla (Mary Mendum) and Chester (Eric Edwards), a laid off handyman and they live in the small town of Baypoint. Every Monday and Wednesday, Priscilla takes a walk by the beach, gazes at the oceans, and reminisces about the past. Abigail Leslie is a harlot who left Baypoint years ago on a sour note: she slept with Priscilla's husband Gordon (Jamie Gillis) and is back in town to finish what she started and that's to seduce everybody.

There's no sex until forty minutes into the film and it's a short girl-girl scene with Abigail Leslie and Alessand. It's important to note Abigail Leslie is a strictly softcore movie. The girl-girl scene between Priscilla and Abigail was awful: the way Priscilla fakes an orgasm it looks like she's laughing hysterically. There are more scenes of Priscilla and Chester talking to each other on the beach than there is sex. Chester says he's going to leave Baypoint but never does. Priscilla keeps dwelling on negative memories of her unfaithful husband. Weak plot and weaker sex scenes makes Abigail Leslie a dull movie.",1520294400,,1097,4.866310160427807
