8532129,5,B008XDSXDC,"I have to admit, it took me a while to get into this seminar since I'm not a coach ... but ... once I got into the suggestions for stuff like ""armor building"" I couldn't be happier that I bought this 14 DVD set! It's listed as 1 DVD in the listing, but it's 14. I wondered about that but for 60 or so dollars for what used to be around 300$ it was worth a shot, it is the full seminar.

If you are a coach this stuff will be worth its weight in gold for you. If you are just looking to get in shape it's wonderful too. It's definitely not a Jane Fonda work out, this is the real deal. Having said that, I'm actually off to the gym to do some Zercher squats! I want to look like Tarzan, and WIN like Tarzan!",1425945600,2,706,3.802721088435374
