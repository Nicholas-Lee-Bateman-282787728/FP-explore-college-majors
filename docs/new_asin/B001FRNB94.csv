3588443,4,B001FRNB94,"Louis is such a great stand-up comedian who has excelled since the early days of his career. I have a young daughter myself, and I am experiencing the same situations in my life. In addition to the use of word ""faggot"", the health problems, ...etc.
He keeps me in-check and locked in.
A great item to own & watch with friends!",1236211200,4,326,4.360655737704918
3588444,1,B001FRNB94,"""Louis C.K. Chewed Up"" was filmed at the Berkley Performance Center in Boston, Massachusetts last March and eventually released by Image Entertainment. Instead of opening with the obligatory salute to the location and the audience, the show opens up with how he misses the word ""faggot"" and how he used it as a kid and later. As he sees it, it never meant ""gay"" but how somebody acted. This leads into his observations on how he respects so much those males who can willingly perform a certain act on a man.

That leads into language and what words mean and how he doesn't see the negative connotations of certain words. Reminiscent of George Carlin's seven dirty words, Louis C.K. continues the theme in more graphic but unoriginal terms. This leads the 40 year old balding comic into various observations on daily life, family, and children, marriage etc.

Humor is subjective and based on the laugh track the audience thought he was absolutely hilarious. Unfortunately, I don't share that opinion. The humor seemed to consist primarily of obscenities and graphic commentary on bodily functions and simply just wasn't funny. Billed as a comedic talent who will ""...create an atmosphere of fearless honesty on stage..."" and a say anything style, I kept thinking how so many other comics had hit the same ideas and done them so much better. His work doesn't seem original and instead comes across as derivative and that the coarser the language the funnier the joke is. From the laugh track, it seemed that a number of folks approved. If I had been there, I would have been asking for a refund soon after the show started. I kept watching hoping I would get to the funny parts but I never did.

Dedicated to George Carlin, the show runs slightly longer than an hour though it seemed considerably longer. The only other feature on the disc is an interview with the comedian himself where he self interviews and answers questions that hade been provided to him. Almost as long as the show, the interview runs approximately 37 minutes and he explains how he got his start in Boston, the creation and evolution of this show which features totally different material than his 2007 show ""Shameless,"" the fact that his comedy is mostly autobiographical, how he develops material and other topics. During the interview, he reiterates the point that his use of coarseness in language is the only way he knows how to be true to who he is.

If you are already a fan of his, then you will love this show and interview. If he is totally new to you, as he was to me, it will be an obscenity filled and graphic experience that may or may not work depending on your own sensibilities.

Please note that this show was done in March 2008.  I didn't realize it was that long ago.  Mind you, it's prior to his divorce so he talks about his wife and is still wearing a wedding ring.  Maybe this is why it wasn't his best work...it seemed he was mentally preoccupied or mentally drained.  If you're a Louis C.K. fan, pass on this.  You've seen better performances and this one will probably ruin it for you.",1387756800,,593,4.051724137931035

It was, unbelievably, nominated for an Emmy, and is dedicated to George Carlin. I'm a great George Carlin fan - I wonder if George
would have laughed at any of this weak humor. I laughed slightly, only once, at one of his masturbation jokes. I'll watch some of his other stand-up routines, but this one was hard to get through, because it was just so boring and not funny. The audience enjoyed it, laughing at absolutely everything - I wish I could have joined them, but couldn't.

For me there is only one brief lull for less than 5 minutes, but that is only the case because I've watched this film at least 10 times.  On this DVD, Louis CK does one of his best bits about his children and explains his uncontrollable eating (including the Cinnabon incident) and struggles with his health as he gets older.  The opening will probably have you hooked as he talks about how certain words are misused and become unusable over time, explaining his take on the words and how he uses them.  Between the editing and his perfect timing, this hour will have anybody who appreciates Louis CK's comedy absolutely mesmerized!",1314403200,,766,4.610294117647059
3588481,5,B001FRNB94,"After spending years in the underground comedy circuit, Louis CK's ""Chewed Up"" is gaining notoriety throughout the comedy world - by comics and fans alike. As a ""comics comic"" he is more than just social commentary (which is biting and 100% accurate), but also gives us a REAL insight to parenting and fatherhood. If you like the clean, fatherly stories from Bill Engvall, this probably isn't for you. But if you've cussed in your head more than a few times at the dinner table when your kid doesn't eat, or really just would love a small vacation from being a parent, Louis CK shares your pain. Excellent, hilarious, side-splitting comedy. Worth every penny.",1312761600,,659,4.84070796460177
3588482,3,B001FRNB94,"By no means am I easily offended but there were some spots on this show that made me cringe and didn't have me cracking so much as a smile never mind a laugh.  The build up, funny as hell and then he crosses a line that he really doesn't have to cross.  Yes I know he pushes it, I get that but so often during this show I was ""well he had me, then he lost me"".  The part about 9 year old boys was horrible - I laughed a little at some of it but when he said the part about how to make one feel better?  Bad, BAD taste.  Same thing with the dog & cottage cheese jokes.  Just bad.  I think Louis C.K. is incredibly hilarious and I will watch his other stand ups but the best of what is on this DVD can be found on youtube.",1312329600,3,720,3.728476821192053

3588484,4,B001FRNB94,"Probably his best special since Shameless, which is my all time favorite of his.
The passing of George Carlin left a huge void in the world. and the closest we will ever probably have to another Carlin is Louis C.k.

3588485,5,B001FRNB94,"Louis CK is hands down, my fav comedian ever! He's one of the few comedians who can literally have me in tears laughing. He even had me in tears laughing at some of his YouTube videos. I can't get enough of his comedy. There's a few Racial jokes in hear though,  so if you're one of those EASILY offended people, then I wouldn't recommend it. I think he made about 2 Black jokes in this (I'm Black myself, & STILL found it hilarious. I hate when people say African American. I hate PC people period).",1294272000,,500,4.2631578947368425

There are some funny bits in this second helping of ""in your face"" observational comedy which make ""Chewed Up"" worth a look. If you are a serious fan, then you should add it to your collection of Louis C.K. comedy.

3588490,5,B001FRNB94,"I've always liked Louis C.K. because he seemed quirky and intelligent and knew how to construct a really funny joke. It wasn't until I heard his new material on ""Chewed Up"" that I gained a new respect for him. A lot the material on this album is family-oriented and his perspective on the institution of marriage and being a family man. This is dangerous territory.

Similar to Eddie Murphy only making banal family films, the validity of comedian comes into question when they become suburbanites and their material focuses solely on that fact. I've heard comedians say that they consciously avoid writing any material involving their family life because they will lose their ""edge."" Louis C.K., surprisingly, shines with this new set. The title itself is an indication of how he feels in this role as a family man. He riffs on his sexless marriage, the joys and pains of raising two daughters and his horrible eating habits and physique.

If you've seen the underrated and prematurely canceled HBO series ""Lucky Louie,"" you'll have an idea of what to expect from ""Chewed Up."" C.K. doesn't show the usual reverence for family-life that most comedians show. He gives you the gritty and unpleasant aspects of being a father and husband, but always tempering that with the affection he has for his family.",1262822400,24,1303,4.891402714932127

3588492,5,B001FRNB94,"For my money, Louis C.K. is the current king of comedy.  I love that no topic is off limits to him, and that he says things that we always think and feel but often don't have the guts to say.  This ridiculously funny show is a perfect-follow up to his great ""Shameless"" special.  If you're looking for big laughs while thinking ""I can't believe he just said that--but it's so true"" then look no further than Louis C.K.",1252540800,44,418,4.333333333333333

3588494,5,B001FRNB94,"OK, let me put it this way. I drove six hours to catch the recording of this show. It was so worth the drive. I honestly hadn't laughed that hard in years. Louis CK is one of the best comedians out there but for some reason is not a big name like unfunny stand up comedians zuch as Dane Cook and Carlos Mencia. Which is tragic because he has truly mastered his craft of making people laugh. The title, Chewed Up, is a reference to something at the end of his act. The material can teeter on deeply offensive but that's if you don't have a sense of humor. It has great replay value and you'll laugh each time you watch it. Do yourself a favor, drop the Cinnabon and buy this DVD.",1244160000,4,678,4.105263157894737

He's a good storyteller, but his comedy works because he doesn't pull any punches.  No word or concept is off limits if its funny and a least a little truthful, PLUS he's the butt of much of his comedy which you need so you don't hate the guy.

If you're already a Louis CK fan, watch this because its just as funny as anything else you've seen by him.

If you haven't watched a Louis CK routine, but you're not easily offended and like raw comedy, you'll dig this.

Highly recommended.",1242345600,4,613,4.1525423728813555
3588497,5,B001FRNB94,"To watch Louis C.K. perform is to understand that life is a brief, violent revolt against the entropic nature of this universe. Things fall apart, dreams don't come true and time cannot be turned back. The horror of experiencing this is heightened for an intelligent, observant person such as Louis C.K. This DVD shows his brave stand against the darkness, making light of his life by showing its greatest follies.

Nothing is unfamiliar! Family, health, money, love - topics alien to no modern human being. His lancet wit cuts true, leaving you paralyzed with laughter - not the kind of laughter politely manufactured for the benefit of mixed company, but rather, the kind that leaves your abdominals hurting and your throat parched.

The further that Louis C.K. goes beyond the normal euphimism-filled commentary on daily life, the harder it gets to deny the relevance of this material to your personal journey through the world. This middle-aged man, unburdened by the handsomeness of the young and unimpeded by the perspective of the old, takes stock of his life, and in so doing, of yours as well.

Watch this performance by a genius of the form, captured here at the height of his mastery, but do not for one moment think that the time you spend with ""Chewed Up"" will not give you pause and bring to the surface a few unwanted realizations.",1241654400,52,1346,4.818181818181818

3588499,3,B001FRNB94,"Let me start by saying Louis CK is by far my favorite comedian. I had high hopes for this show, but was let down.  It covers all the familiar subject matter, taken from Louis' own life - his children's stupidity, his eating habits, masturbation, etc., but it feels like treaded ground instead of anything truly inspired here.  There is some rare material here, such as his doctor visit (which the diagnosis is hilarious), but in the end everything seems like a less-funny rehash of his earlier work.  It's still funny, hence the 3 stars, but if you're looking for something truly brilliant check out his earlier work Shameless.",1238803200,4,627,4.787037037037037
