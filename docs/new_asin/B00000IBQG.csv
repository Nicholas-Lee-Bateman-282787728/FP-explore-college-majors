7910077,1,B00000IBQG,"A total disappointment
This is a book not a DVD
I would rate this no star",1435708800,,73,3.625
7910078,1,B00000IBQG,"When I ordered this dvd, I believed it to be a collection of movies, NOT a collection of clips, which to me is just stupid.  So I donated it to my local library after watching about 3 minutes of the dvd.  Unsatisfied customer.  I believe it was not as it was advertised....",1370822400,,273,4.211538461538462
7910079,1,B00000IBQG,"I bought this disk through Amazon from Amazing Media -- HUGE  MISTAKE dealing with that company!  When I put the disk into my DVD player, a message came back as NO DISK.  So I tried the disk in two other players I have.  It would not play in any of those players either. I put it into my computer and, of course, nothing happened.  A right-click informed me that I needed to insert a disk.  To the computer, this was not a disk.  Clearly this was a defectively-manufactured disk.  When I contacted Amazing Media they refused to take it back and replace it with a working disk.  They said that I must have damaged it.  What chutzpah!  The reason they gave is that I'd notified them after the 30-day cutoff date.  This disk is demonstratively defective, not scratched or damaged in any way.  A legitimate company would take it back.  Stay clear of Amazing Media!!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Best-of-Film-Noir/dp/B00000IBQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Best of Film Noir</a>",1325808000,,1019,5.209876543209877
7910080,2,B00000IBQG,"This video is good for those of us who love Film Noir and want a listing of films that fall under this category.  HOWEVER - they got some facts wrong.  For instance, in the video they talk about the movie ""The Maltese Falcon"", based on the book of the same name, and how it's central character, Sam Spade, is the quintessential detective.  They stated that Raymond Chandler wrote this book. WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Dashiell Hammett wrote this book, thus creating the detective Sam Spade.  Raymond Chandler created the detective Philip Marlowe, in books such as ""The Big Sleep"".  Who edited this movie anyway - did they not check their facts????",1224806400,,640,4.87962962962963
7910081,4,B00000IBQG,"This was a great movie for me to watch. I love 40's and 50's movies, so I thought the movie really showed a lot of the different movies from that time period. I even went out and bought a few of the movies that were featured. The video also shows exclusive interviews and some Academy award footage.  It definitely shows the differences and similarities to today's Hollywood image.",1183852800,,381,4.602941176470588
7910082,1,B00000IBQG,"Derived almost exclusively from trailers from the worst source prints imaginable, the accompanying serious narrative includes such gaffs as: Raymond Chandler is the author of The Maltese Falcon (a mistake that is made repeatedly); and the plot of Notorious described as: ""a man in love with a scientist's daughter - the scientist is held captive by Nazi collaborators.""  I kid you not.",1033344000,,385,5.209677419354839
