336649,3,6301603389,"Wes Craven's shocker may look good, but it isn't! The movie is nearly 2 hours long and is so drawn out that interest will fade in about half an hour. The Gore factor is almost non-existant: unlike Wes' Nightmare on Elmstreet, Shocker cuts away right when the person is being killed and then cuts back when the job is done. Another irritating thing is that every ten minutes someone says ""No more mister nice guy"" which makes absolutely no sense in the movie considering that Pinker has always been a killer. The only reason why I gave this movie 3 stars is because of Mitch Puligi, because he gives a great performance and speeds the movie up.",999993600,,643,4.504273504273504
336650,2,6301603389,WES CRAVEN REALLY MISSED WITH THIS ONE.  I WATCHED IT AND IT REALLY DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME.  I THOUGHT IT WAS KIND OF STUPID AND SHUT IT OFF IN THE MIDDLE.,979084800,,160,3.8181818181818183
336651,3,6301603389,"Serial killer who knocks off families is caught red handed by his own son and when brought to terms by the death penalty, survives the electric chair and takes on a new form, hopping from body to body. He then tracks down his  son and tries to put an end to him. Excellent NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET clone  is well created by the writer/director Wes Craven. And in essence, it's not  a clone at all. It eliminates the slow motion from NIGHTMARE and pours on  the bone-crunching action which is pre-determined by the heavy metal '80's  music played throughout. Very entertaining.",950313600,5,575,4.653465346534653

336754,5,6301603389,"I saw this movie many years ago and I thought it was very good, yet creepy at times. It was kind of scary now, but back then really terrified me. It was very interesting and different. Great movie then, and still a great movie now.",1380499200,2,231,4.155555555555556
336755,5,6301603389,"This is one of Wes Craven's best movies in my opinion. The plot is very creepy,and the killer is a ruthless psychopath named Horace Pinker,who is completly unqiue and original,unlike alot of the other movie killers,that were popular at the time. Sure the film has it's cheesey moments,with some of it's over-the-top acting,and campy one-liners,but in no way,does it make this a bad movie. ""Shocker"" is an underrated Horror flick,that didin't get the love that it deserved. If you love scary movies,then check this one out.",1370908800,2,522,5.0813953488372094
336756,2,6301603389,"I know that lots of folks love Wes Craven's movies; I just don't happen to be one of those folks. The only reason I rented this is that someone compared a piece of my artwork to the effects in this movie, and I thought what the heck? The movie is outrageous, and even a bit funny, but it just didn't do it for me.

Let me add, I watch movies to be entertained, not to criticize. I was only about 2 stars entertained by this.",1365465600,2,424,3.988235294117647
336757,4,6301603389,just like all wes craven movies from the past its very corny but fun.  one of the movies I like watching every few years and the soundtrack is great!,1349049600,,149,4.137931034482759

336759,2,6301603389,This movie started out okay. I actually enjoyed the first 45 minutes or so. Seemed like a pretty decent slasher flick. I even liked how the main character interacted with the killer through his dreams and had to be woke up before he got killed. Very reminiscent of Nightmare on Elm St. But after they caught the killer and executed him by the electric chair and he became an electro ghost killer (for lack of a better phrase) the movie just got flushed down the toilet. I think I dropped a whole star after the scene in the tv. It doesn't get much more horrible than that. I don't mind cheese in horror flicks. Its common. But I literally felt embarassed in front of the other people watching this with me cuz I rented it. I bet Craven doesn't put this one on his resume. 2 stars for the first 45 minutes that were okay.,1102291200,3,820,4.296774193548387
