3411863,5,B00186R3NM,"This Reiki DVD is quite different then the other two that I own.  It gives a lot more information and is a little bit better done then his earlier DVD's.  You can tell he is listening to critiques and trying to offer more information and give a better quality video.

Anyway, my comments are on the crystal images I see when the camera zooms in for the attunement.  On previous video's I did not see any images on the crystal but for some reason this crystal has many.  I was wondering if anyone has noticed images when gazing in their crystal too.

Examples of images that I see very clearly are:  In left corner as I face the t.v. is a translucent image of a face of a young boy with blonde curly hair who is looking toward me but away from the ocean waves that fade into the background.  His upper body fades however,  I can see his waist and that he is wearing a studded belt buckle and is wearing jeans.
When I look toward his feet, they fade into yet another image of an older gentleman like in his late 30's with dark brown hair and a beard, who is sitting cross legged in what looks like a meditative position and in the background in this image I can see 3 slim rock structures.

The third image I see is on the right side of the crystal.  It's of an older gentleman with white hair perhaps he is in his early 50's.  I can see that he is wearing a short sleeve shirt and is staring out to what would be the ocean of the first images background.  Except I know that he is leaning forward looking at a pasture with a single animal in it.  A cow or a horse, I cannot tell which.

The fourth image I see is in the lower right corner of the crystal.  It is of two children one is a boy and one is a girl.  The boy has straight, brown hair that is short and he is seated in a chair looking at the girl that is sitting right beside him.  She has curly hair which I would say is blonde she is wearing a dress and is turned toward the boy but looking down toward the ground as if she is looking for something.

I have no idea if these are camera tricks or if my mind is playing tricks on me.  I have always known that I have Clairsentience abilities but never Clairvoyance ability...Thanks for sincere thoughts.

Update:  Since viewing this video I have actually been able to see many and varied images when gazing at crystals or spheres on the computer screen but not so much in person.  Pictures are always of different scenes and always very clear so that I can determine many small details.  I have no idea what the images mean on a personal level and always wonder if they are even supposed to make sense to me.",1258502400,,2616,4.134653465346535
3411864,5,B00186R3NM,"Steve's set of books and the two DVD's that go along with his Reiki Master program are invaluable for the Reiki Practitioner. The Reiki Master Attunement DVD gave me a true attunement, enhancing my healing abilities. Steve's books, Reiki the Ultimate Guide, Ultimate Guide Vol 2, Ultimate Guide Vol 3, Ultimate Guide Vol 4, and Reiki Beliefs Exposed For All are fabulous and filled with a wealth of information. His DVD, A Reiki 1st, Aura and Chakra Attunement Preformed, is an excellent companion to the books demonstrating the actual processes of performing attunements. I will use this set again and again as reference along my path of Reiki healing.",1258329600,,653,5.0
3411865,5,B00186R3NM,"Since my first attunement many years ago, I have been looking for answers about reiki. Even after becoming a reiki master, the questions remained. Either due to secrecy, or they themselves just didn't know. Since I was a young boy I have always wanted to know more about becoming a healer. It seemed with every turn came a hefty price or a brick wall. How does one explain a healing procedure, when your not sure of the answers yourself. It was like having an owners manual with most of the pages missing. Needless to say my reiki practice was limited to animals and close associates. Hey...at least the animals didn't ask questions. lol. After hearing about Steve Murrays Ultimate guides and dvd's, I was skeptical. I did research and found all the wonderful things that was said about him and his reiki guides. My instincts kept telling me to go for it. To take a chance. So, in a bold endeavor for answers, I purchased all 5 volumes of Steve Murrays reiki guides. Plus, his book Reiki False Beliefs Exposed. His 1st, 2nd, and master reiki attunement dvds. Psychic and chakra attunement dvds. And his Animal Psychic Communications book. I'm here to tell you, it was one of the best investments I have ever made!! From the time I opened the first Ultimate guide. Answers came faster than I could have ever imagined. Through the straight forward and concise information in these materials, I have a renewed confidence. With the first book, I have learned more in one sitting than I had in several years of questioning. With his psychic and chakra attunements, I have actually seen profound results in a short amount of time. Steve Murrays Reiki False Beliefs Exposed was very in depth. Really cleared the air on the reality of reiki. As for his Animal Psychic Communications book. It has helped tremendously between myself and my horses, and pets. A special thank you goes to Steve Murray for his outstanding work.",1254441600,2,1914,4.733532934131737
3411866,5,B00186R3NM,"I learned about Steve's Psychic DVDs after having experience with Steve's Reiki materials.  As usual, he publishes products that far exceed my expectations.  In addition to his Reiki Materials, I also have his Psychic DVDs.

For me, they do work, but they start off subtlety, but build up over time.  I have done the Psychic Attunement several times, and each time I have a different experience, and the experiences build on the prior experiences in intensity and clarity.  Same goes for the second DVD.  Stick with his recommendation of waiting 2 weeks between attunements.

What can I say about Steve Murray and his work... I have been a Reiki practitioner for over a decade, and I can tell you that Steve's books and DVDs are among my most treasured possessions on my book case. I see his work benefiting both existing Reiki practitioners and those just looking to get started.

Steve's books are like GOLD, as they are actually more comprehensive than the materials provided by most Reiki masters to their students. I am sure that many Reiki Masters must be upset with Steve, as he divulges information that most Reiki Masters believe to be secret, including all the symbols up to Master Level, and the attunement processes. Most Reiki books do not include this information, and have been very disappointing to me.

After buying his first book, I decided, after reading the reviews, I needed to own the others. I currently have all 5 Reiki guides and the Reiki myths book. And, of course, the package would not be complete without the DVDs.

I would say, though, that although the first book is excellent, it is not enough for me. I needed the Visual of the DVDs to bring it all home. So, I don't think that you can buy a single book, read it, and walk away a Reiki Master. Each of his books and DVDs, however, complements the others. With the combination of the Books, DVDs, studying and practice, you CAN BECOME A REIKI MASTER.

What's awesome about the DVDs is that you can take the attunements over and over again. As someone who was attuned in person by a Reiki Master over a Decade ago, I can attest to the DVD attunements as being every bit as effective as in person.

My only criticism is that the whole package should be sold as a complete set, as once you get started, you will want the whole set anyway. However, I guess that most will not want to plunk down that money (even though it is completely reasonable in the scheme of things) without first experiencing the quality of it with the first book.

If you are interested in Reiki, and don't want to waste your time and money with disappointments, just get this material, and you will not regret it.",1238716800,12,2667,4.60126582278481
3411867,5,B00186R3NM,"I like Steve Murray's books and DVD's because they are written by a man who truly believes in Reiki and what Reiki can do for everyone. Steve's introduction is quite honest and I know of others who share this philosophy and dedication to making Reiki affordable to people.

What these books and DVD's can give you is a working knowledge of how to draw the symbols and the process of attunements both receiving and giving. The pictures are very easy to follow and detail hand positions and how and where to draw the symbols for passing on attunements.  As for the complaints for not having the traditional hand placements he clearly states the philosophy behind his reasons to give treatment to specific places of the body and why.  This made sense to me and as I know every practitioner is not the same.  Getting the traditional placements online is easy.

I also felt the attunement dvd's or video's Steve Murray has available are amazing. They are wonderful, life altering, and being absolutely blessed experience. Reiki is for everyone willing to learn and he provides it.  Thanks for not coloring inside the lines.
Namaste.",1230595200,,1127,4.813471502590674
3411868,5,B00186R3NM,"I was already a Reiki Master, and purchased Steve Murray's, Reiki Ultimate Guide, Ultimate Guide Vol. 2, Vol. 3, and Vol. 4, along with the DVD attunements for each. The attunements were very powerful, and the energy flow is no doubt stronger. This program has to be the most convent, and realistic way to get started in the Reiki healing practice. I have tried several other Reiki programs in the past, and Steve Murrays Reiki Ultimate Guides, are the very best I have found yet. You will not be disappointed.

3411869,5,B00186R3NM,"This DVD lives up to its promise, just like Vol. 1. I would recommend it to all especially if you took the Psychic Attunement from Vol. 1. I also pre-ordered the book, Reiki the Ultimate Guide Vol. 5 Learn New Psychic Attunements to Expand Psychic Gifts & Healing which I'm looking forward to reading and studying it.",1218758400,4,317,4.578947368421052
3411870,5,B00186R3NM,This is one of two of Steve's new DVDs and like all his programs is great. Would recommend to all who have an interest in developing their psychic abilities.,1218067200,3,157,4.448275862068965
3411871,5,B00186R3NM,"Several days ago I purchased Steve Murray's Reiki Psychic Attunement Vol. 2.  My previous experience with Murray's DVDs and books has been informative, easy to follow, and extremely powerful.  This new DVD exceeded already high expectations. Murray clearly defines clairsentience, clairaudience, and clairvoyance; explains what an attunement is, how to prepare for it, and what to expect afterwards.  Although each individual will have a unique experience each time the attunement is given, my experience was moving and dynamic.  Since the attunement my dreamtime has literally exploded with material and I look forward to what will happen next!  I will continue to use this latest DVD at the suggested intervals to reinforce and expand my psychic abilities. If you have any interest in exploring your psychic abilities, get both of Murray's Reiki Psychic Attunement DVDs now.",1217376000,14,876,5.45925925925926
3411872,5,B00186R3NM,"I had used the Psychic Attunement 1 and got excellent results, This DVD was very powerful in its effects on my abilities.  I find all the Steve Murray DVDs and books extremely easy to use and understand.
I have reccommended this DVD to all my friends for increasing their awareness and ability to gather information from their psychic senses.
I feel the inflow of new information has heightened my ability to see beyond conscious levels of the every day events in my life. Thank You Steve.",1217376000,18,489,4.686046511627907

8268504,1,B00186R3NM,"This was a curiosity order. fortunately for me the DVD arrived defective. I would later have the opportunity to view DVD in its entirety after borrowing it from a friend.
First, a little background on me.
I have been a practicing Reiki Master for a number of years. When I first received my reiju (or initiation) into Usui/Tibetan Reiki; My Reiki Master taught me that there are many charlatans out there. While I refuse to say that Mr. Murray is one; I also believe that his publication and sell of this so-called Psychic Attunement series was and is not for ALTRUISTIC reasons. BUYER BEWARE.
Is Steve Murray a genuine Reiki Master? Perhaps. More than likely he is but Reiki is NOT traditionally taught on DVDs and MOST definitely CANNOT receive an attunement from a DVD. In all forms of Reiki, Reiki energy is passed directly from Master to student in a sacred and hands-on ceremony. Anything less than this Reiju is to bastardize Reiki tradition and quite frankly robs the student of the TRADITION one-on-one /Student/teacher relationship.
So all those so-called distance courses on Udemy and more specifically this course is complete and utter BS manifested as worthless and non-existent transmutation of information-NOT REIKI. Just like you can't read a book about Law School and become an Attorney or read a book about Medical School and become a Doctor - YOU CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT learn Reiki by proxy. Find a respectable Reiki Master that you can travel to and let him or her lay their hands on you directly!!!",1495670400,,1518,4.842307692307692
8268505,5,B00186R3NM,"Wow! I think this really works. The changes were slow but noticeable in my psychic abilities. Now, I can feel the energy coursing through my body when I listen.

This particular program has three different attunments on it, each to help increase a specific psychic ability and function.
