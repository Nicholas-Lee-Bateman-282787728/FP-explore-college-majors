At a time when TV westerns were either adapted from radio programs or based upon completely fictitious characters, Rahide was a rare exception.  Week after week, for seven years, Rawhide invited us along on a historically accurate 1860's cattle drive from San Antonio, Texas to Sedalia, Kansas.  Absolutely everything about Rawhide was first class.  The rich, sprawling, hour-long episodes allowed characters to develop and powerful stories to unfold.  The music, which included a hit theme performed by Frankie Laine, was written by Hollywood legend Dimitri Tiomkin, and best of all, the brilliant ensemble cast introduced Clint Eastwood in the role that made him famous - the young ramrod, Rowdy Yates.

Fleming's presence as Favor was so dominant that it centered the entire show and provided the base around which all the other characters revolved. ....His was the voice of reason and responsibility; he took command and inspired confidence. ...The series was mostly shot in Nogales, Arizona and the authenticity of the trail drive was staggering - enough win The Western Heritage Award from the National Cowboy Hall of Fame four years in a row. The award named Rawhide the outstanding program of its genre for excellence in depicting the West.

They left Eric Fleming out of the CBS VHS tape (he had passed on when CBS released these VHS tapes, maybe that is why he was left out), but Eric was the reason for the show's success (Clint as Rowdy was the second best character). Eric Fleming as Gil Favor is absolutely amazing. It is something special to hear his voice and the way he talks.  Eric Fleming was a remarkable man. I haven't seen anyone come close to the way he comes across in Rawhide. It's difficult to describe Eric and all the episodes he was in, but he can do it all and better than anyone ever has or probably ever will.  There will never be another man quite like Eric Fleming.
Rawhide is the most entertaining and special series I have ever seen. They don't make anything like it anymore, and there hasn't been anything since that can hold a candle to it.  There were 217 epsiodes made, and to date (Nov. 2004) they have released many VHS (6 CBS VHS, 50 episodes from Columbia House) and since approximately Dec. 2003 started making some of them available on DVD!  These two episodes are excellent.",1100995200,6,2386,4.823529411764706
