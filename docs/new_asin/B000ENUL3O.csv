8158757,5,B000ENUL3O,"This is a music documentary about one of the great Afro-Cuban conguero's in Afro-Cuban music & jazz. It was very informative & entertaining. I have a few of his solo cds & I put him up there with Mongo Santamaria, Patato, Francisco Aguabella, & Armando Peraza. This video was also dedicated to Mongo, & it was good to see Candido's childhood & how he grew up, seeing what got him into conga playing, & who he played with musically. Basically talking about his whole career as the great conga player that he was & still is to this day. I'm glad to have this dvd in my collection.",1378684800,,578,4.361111111111111
