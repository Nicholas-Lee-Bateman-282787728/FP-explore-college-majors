8187967,2,B000P0I4N0,"I've known a few fighter pilots in my time, and they are nothing like what's depicted in this anime.  The main character is an angst ridden pilot with a couple of demons and reservations.  The characters surrounding him are all in a state of ultra-profundity and have this seriousness pervading everything they say and do.

Real fighter pilots tend to have a bit of brovado and are otherwise outgoing in their own way.  Think of an artist with the attitude of an engineer.  That's a fighter pilot.  But that's not what we get here.

The characters are dull, the story is so-so, the plot plods along and might have carried a richer story had the characters been multidimensional.  The animation itself is a mix of CGI and Japanese traditional animation, which is somewhat stiff (as a lot of anime tends to be).

The series tries to inject some actual military jargon and language, but it feels ham fisted.  Combine that with the dullness of this miniseries, and you get this odd mix that makes for a borderline bad series.

Some of the action sequences are interesting, but none of the JAM technology or character is explained, and there tend to be these very heavy moments within the action sequences, again making for a very odd mix story elements, and again making for a nearly bad series.

It's watchable, but only just.  Unlike Macross, Yukikaze attempts to be accurate in technical detail, but misses the fact that it's character and story that carries film forward, not plot and technical accuracy.  Ergo where Macross is kind of ridiculous by showing flying carriers, or jet fighters transforming into giant robots and so forth, the events and the dynamics of Hikaru and Minmay and the rest, carry the story forward.

What Yukikaze wanted to be was a plot driven naval aviation adventure regarding an alien transgression.  But none of the setup is thuroughly explained, the characters are too serious to be taken seriously (real military men take situations seriously, but are not reserved in expressing their thoughts ... if you're wrong, they let you know!), and the striving for technical accuracy is laughable.

For all that the animation has a professional anime-gloss to it, making it presentable as a visual experience, but that's about it.

Dumb, dull, and otherwise misses the mark on a number of levels.  Avoid this, or maybe see it once.  If you loved Macross, then stick with Macross.",1460419200,,2403,4.8431372549019605
8187968,5,B000P0I4N0,"This was a fun Anime. There was lots of action and aliens, the animation was perfect, very well drawn out. The only problem I had was the ending it kind of made me wanting more, I felt unfulfilled with the unknowing. I won't go into detail because I don't want to spoil it for other viewers.  The item arrived on time, and was in excellent condition. The price for this item was well worth it.",1419033600,,393,4.24
8187969,4,B000P0I4N0,"For those of you that like mecha anime or anime with planes this one is for you.  What I really like about this anime compared to others is the storyline.  It is more on the dark serious side.  I love the Macross universe and I place this anime up there with respect to character development and a different twist to a common theme (that being aliens show up on Earth).  The dog fight scenes are some of the best and of important note, the English voice dubbing is surprisingly good as the voices used capture the personalities of the characters.  This DVD set comes with all 5 episodes on three discs.  Either I did something wrong but the episodes seem to not play in one right after another; once one episode is complete, you return to the disc menu to select the next; it does not automatically load.  In addition, the format is 4:3.  I know there is now the blu-ray version but honestly when it comes to anime I do not care for widescreen.  Plus the blu-ray set is around $100+.  Finally although some may find this series odd, apparently Warner Brother's picked up the rights and is currently working on making a live action version of the movie.  Overall a must have and a great buy story.",1417392000,,1196,4.415525114155251
8187970,4,B000P0I4N0,"for an anime of its time, the story, special effects, the mechs, and all the work that went into this mini-series is very well done. i loved it, i think it could have been a regular series though, but still its a nice piece of work...",1401494400,,234,4.108695652173913
8187971,2,B000P0I4N0,"I didn't enjoy the plot, nor the characters of that well known series... Don't know why, it just felt structures without contents. For fans only I guess.",1393718400,,153,4.703703703703703
8187972,3,B000P0I4N0,"A dimensional portal was opened 33 years ago. Aliens known as The JAM came through and attacked Earth. The military was able to drive them back to their home world, where the fight continues. Lt. Fukai pilots a jet with an advanced AI on board. It is called Yukikaze. The war is at a stalemate, but the existence of Yukikaze could turn things around. It may be a blessing, or even a curse. One thing is certain. The war is about to end.

This anime is very strange. I think that it's one of those that will likely create huge fans or ardent naysayers. I have mixed feelings. I think that the plot was pretty well done. It's a lot like Robotech. The major flaw with this series is the character development. A series as short as this doesn't really have much chance to develop good characters. None of the characters have any personality. They are empty and lifeless, except for Major Bukhar. The story moves very slowly, but manages to keep you relatively interested in what is going to happen next.

The production quality is very good for a series from 2002. The animation, voice acting, soundtrack, and plot are very well done. They obviously took care to make a quality product. It's not a bad series, it's just not my cup of tea. I like characters with lots of emotion and depth, in addition to a great story. If you feel the same as me, you should probably avoid this title.

When I first started watching Yukikaze, I gave up after episode 1. It was very strange and moved very slow. After a couple of months, I stared again at episode 2. Things start to get more normal, and the series gains a little depth. Even so, the lack of character depth and drama makes it an average watch in my opinion. Like I said before, I think most will either love it or hate it. I can't recommend buying this OVA before you've seen it. I think you should watch it online before spending your money. I kind of wish that I had. I can't see myself watching it again. I'll probably sell this DVD.",1361145600,,1981,4.377717391304348
8187973,5,B000P0I4N0,very excellent series it has a nice blend of 3d graffics and animation the story though short was very interesting and it seamed to gather every bit of my attention while i watched it,1320883200,,183,4.411764705882353
8187974,5,B000P0I4N0,I grabbed this by chance just wanted to have anime it is good man vs machine how both come together to form a pact becoming ever stronger n powerful the story is good about a pliot who is in the air force protecting space from harm he go onto discover his machine has a mind of its own how both cover each other back the story is steady and true it builds as it go on I like this one worth seeing,1286064000,,396,3.841463414634146
8187975,5,B000P0I4N0,"I'm not particularly interested in fancy aircraft, military jargon, or realistic air combat, so most everything that gets mentioned in the same breath as Yukikaze is not my cup of tea. Though, the plot is not especially unique, this anime has what alot of those in the same genre do not; loads of atmosphere, and dressed down, believable characters. Yukikaze is as much a character as Rei and Bukhar. The trippy down tempo soundscore definetely enhances the scenes rather than jar or distract the way that some anime's soundtracks do. There's not alot of high sounding rhetoric, or exposition. I can't sit through much of that. Instead it's all pretty straight forward, with a reasonable sequence of events and resolution. I'm sure the sci-fi, and aircraft enthusiasts will get even more out of it than I did. The anime legends collection is definetely worth checking out.",1230508800,,872,4.97945205479452
8187976,5,B000P0I4N0,"First, great price for a 3 DVD set.

YuKikaze has an incredible and top of the line animation. The flight action sequences are really intense and well designed. It reminds me of Macross Zero, another flawless animation like YuKikaze.",1193788800,,233,4.9743589743589745
