3540393,5,B001DW2BVA,"Tim Noonan is a master teacher as well as a master magician and entertainer, or should I say enthraller. This is the real thing.",1218153600,,128,4.375
3540394,5,B001DW2BVA,"Whenever he started a session, I would get so involved my coffee would get cold.  For those of us who have contempt prior to investigation about these ""snake oil salesman,"" Tim takes all doubt out of that image.  Hope you have as much fun as my family and I have had.

3540395,5,B001DW2BVA,"First of all, I am not a magician and I have tried many other books and dvds teaching magic, hoping to learn a cool trick or two to perform at family functions or parties.  Until now, most of the magic dvds and books I checked out were either outdated and lame or strictly for the professional ""working"" magician.  That is until I ordered Tim Noonan's Learn Magic DVD set.  Tim shows you in a clear, concise and FUN way how to amaze your friends and loved ones with highly accessible and impressive magic tricks.  Top notch, well done Mr. Noonan!",1218153600,,546,4.43
3540396,5,B001DW2BVA,"Wow! I was extremely impressed with The Tim Noonan DVD Boxed Set, and would recommend it to anyone wanting to learn quality magic. In my opinion, this is top notch magic taught by a real pro. Previously guarded secrets are now mine!",1218153600,,232,4.5476190476190474
8295049,2,B001DW2BVA,"I expected a lot from these DVD's and I had procured these based on the outstanding reviews given.
it was disappointing to see the DVD did not met my expectations as they were too basics.

It's not worth the money you pay for these DVD's. I expected a lot and almost complete magic out
of these DVD box. Really, really disappointed.",1368662400,,332,4.442622950819672
8295050,5,B001DW2BVA,"Tim Noonan's ""Learn Magic"" DVD set is a good investment for someone who wants to embrace an addictive hobby. The tricks, though not that difficult, are of top notch quality and would be right at home in the current acts of many working pro's. I believe what differentiates Tim's treatise from similar products is that it is aimed at those who work in business, such as salesmen.  The effects, many of which are impromptu, are demonstrated in living room, office and dining room environments where a salesman may be interacting with a client or trying to engage a ""gate-keeper"".  The presentations are non condescending and, believe it or not, in many effects, the spectator often winds up as big a star as the performer. I think that that is a good thing if you are trying to sell someone something (or, if you just happen to like them!). If the viewer gets nothing else from these dvd's, he should learn the importance of great presentation and timing. Tim makes it almost too easy.
Tim and I have worked together in the past, and, whether it is close up magic (which these dvd's address) or stage, he is the consummate professional and very well suited to teach a not always easy subject.",1232064000,3,1190,4.6350710900473935
8295051,4,B001DW2BVA,"I've known Tim for many years now and have seen him perform top-notch magic in a variety of performing situations. These videos live up to his reputation as one of the best magicians out there working today. And I should know. Long before I became a hypnotist and author I was a magician myself. Back when I was learning magic as a kid there were no videos and DVDs, you had to learn from books which is a tedious and time consuming process. Learning magic on DVD is a much better way to go.

There are many magic DVDs on the market today, but most are padded with useless fluff that will never be used. Tim has created of collection of excellent effects that are easy to learn and fun to do. The only reason I didn't give this set 5 stars is that he neglected to list which tricks are taught anywhere on this order page or on the box cover. There's a lot of really great material here, but unfortunately you'll only know that once you get the discs and put them put them in your DVD player.

8295052,5,B001DW2BVA,"I met Tim in Los Angeles some years ago while he was working at a trade show, and between shows we talked - well I talked about my interest in magic and how I was an amateur novice. Tim was a gentleman and very helpful in pointing me in the direction of which books to learn from. Unfortunately I am not the reading type and I did not get very far with them.

Imagine my surprise when looking on Amazon I found a set of DVD's produced by Tim. I snapped them up and have not looked back.

I can highly recommend these teaching discs, especially if like me you are not good at following written instructions. Each disc is set out to find everything easily, whether you just want to watch the trick or go back over the mechanics of the effect, and Tim has such a relaxed and humorous style that makes the learning fun and I love the out takes on the discs !!

There is great magic on each of the discs that blows my friends away and each of them is easy to learn, even if some of them do require more practise.

I am now looking for a teaching DVD to improve my memory so I can remember more of these superb tricks.

If you read this Tim, Thank you for producing this set, they are . . . well words can't really describe how good I think they are, may be one day I will meet you again and I can show you a couple of my favourite tricks.",1218672000,8,1333,3.9962406015037595
8295053,5,B001DW2BVA,"I started seriously studying magic two years ago, and in that time, I have spent a small fortune ... well, a LARGE fortune, buying books, tapes, DVDs, effects, and pretty much anything I could get my hands on.

I wish I had started with Tim's set of DVD's.  This edition is a treasure.  It is taught with incredible skill and passion by someone who gets where the heart of magic lies.

I have seen Tim Noonan perform a number of times.  He is magnificent.  And what he is giving away here is not only generous, it's practically insane....",1218499200,12,538,4.438775510204081
8295054,5,B001DW2BVA,"The Learn Magic DVD's are great. I do magic for a living and I'm always looking for teaching vehicles for people who ask about learning magic and these DVD's by Timothy Noonan are perfect for that. Heck, I even found a couple of goodies for me. There is a range of effects suitable for beginner and experienced performer alike. So if you're looking for something to help you get started in the wonderful world of magic you couldn't make a better choice.",1218499200,6,453,4.536585365853658
8295055,5,B001DW2BVA,"A great mix of tricks, some more challenging than others, many of them will amaze your friends but are relatively easy to learn and can be performed without elaborate preparation. Much of magic comes down to presentation; watching Tim and his delivery teaches you both the magic as well as how to perform the tricks for maximum effect. Plus it's just plain fun to see how these tricks are done!",1218240000,,394,4.642857142857143
8295056,5,B001DW2BVA,"I've looked at a lot of video instructions for the budding magician and this tops the list.  The magic is great, the instructions are clear and easy to follow, and the entire production is just plain fun to watch!  Tim really went out of his way to match the perfect magic trick for right settings.  You'll be more than happy with this purchase!",1218240000,2,345,4.444444444444445
8295057,5,B001DW2BVA,I've read a couple books (magic for dummies) but seeing this actually done for someone makes it so much easier!  The stuff is so clever it's hard not to tell the secret (don't do it!),1218153600,,183,4.228571428571429
