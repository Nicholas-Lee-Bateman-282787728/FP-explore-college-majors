2664807,3,B000J103UW,"I've been going on a rip lately, borrowing every horror movie available from my local library, wallowing in disappointment night after night.  This film was different enough to capture my interest, with a beautiful haunted house filmed carefully to show the subtle colors and textures.  I enjoyed seeing a cast that I didn't recognize for once, and the acting was above par - I never yelled at the television, nor flung cheezy poofs across the living room.  I'd like to see what the director would do with better backing in the future; talented filming is a rarity nowadays, and these scenes were smooth and composed.  The set decoration was nice, but I wonder if anyone would leave antiques lying around a college rental.

I wanted more detail about the history of a spirit clock, but perhaps this was just a plot device that the filmmakers invented.  I'm not sure how the rental company would be able to put that many people together in one place who all sported ""dark pasts"" and minor clock-fixing skills, so perhaps that's why it took two hundred years for those spirits to get it right.  Even though this was a bit predictable, I didn't go nuts hollering, ""Well, what are the odds of that?"" since it kept my interest and was fun to watch.  Unusual.",1256342400,6,1253,4.663636363636364
2664808,2,B000J103UW,"This is a B movie.  It wasn't bad, but the one redeeming value of it was that Billie Piper was in it which is the reason I ordered it in the first place.  That being said, I am satisfied with my order.",1229385600,6,201,3.761904761904762
2664809,5,B000J103UW,"I'm not much of a horror film fanatic. I've seen a few, but I'm not overly into the intense ones.

This film was perfect for someone like me. The film has it's scary parts, but it isn't totally horrific to the point of wetting yourself as you watch. The story is rather good, involving an old mansion used for student housing and a spirit clock (which is apparently used to communicate between the spirit world).
The characters are rather good. There's Jenny, the main character, played by Billie Piper (Doctor Who, Secret Diary of a Call Girl) who basically informs the other characters about the spirit world and the strange happenings going on in the house. Her mother was a spirit medium, and so she has been around that sort of thing for as long as she can remember.

The film does have a bit of blood and gore, but nothing to the degree of some of the other things I've seen, so it's fine for anyone who is a bit queasy, I suppose.

I thought the film was really great, but if you're looiking for the scariest horror film of your life, you've probably got the wrong film. It's more of a psycological thriller, if I had to place it.

Hope you enjoy it, if you're going to buy it!!
I certainly did.",1227571200,,1202,4.352678571428571
2664810,5,B000J103UW,"I'm a Billie Piper fan, so I was curious to see her acting in something else other than ""Dr. Who"".  She did quite well!  The movie plot was different than some I've seen.  A very unique ending than expected too!  Very happy with the movie!  It should be watched maybe on a scary night or around Halloween to help set the mood and adventure. A special note also: (This is not for younger or small children!  There is strong Language, Abuse, Violence and  Nudity that is not for the younger crowd at all! It should be marked more clearly on this, which it is not!)  There is an added section for each actors take on the movie, from their point of view.  They also give a voice on their thoughts on each others performances and how they got along while filming this movie that adds a great personal touch!  Looking for more work from Billie Piper, her career is taking a great turn, and climbing to unexpected highs!",1220745600,20,913,4.380952380952381
2664811,5,B000J103UW,"I loved this movie, it was intruging, and suspenceful. It had little bit of everything, it was very good, in my opinion, you have to watch it, and judge for yourself. Because everyone has thier own taste.",1208736000,,204,4.54054054054054
2664812,3,B000J103UW,"Compared to a lot of horror movies being made today, SPIRIT TRAP is an okay if average spook tale.

A group of college students find themselves sharing quarters in a huge, but spooky house.  We have the girl with the mysterious past; the nice guy next door type; the brash and arrogant drug dealer and his nymphomaniacal girlfriend, plus the mysterious recluse.  Soon they encounter the spirit of a slave who was murdered in the house and wants to come back to life.  It's all pretty predictable and a little slow at times, but it creates an eerie mood and the actors are decent, especially Luke Mably (PRINCE AND ME) as the hedonistic jerk.",1172102400,14,641,4.5964912280701755
2664813,4,B000J103UW,"There is nothing particulary original about Spirit Trap.  You've got the old house; the multitude of spooky occurances that people see out of the corner of their eye, but are gone when they look directly; the dream sequences with lots of running water, and people waking up screaming after a hand reaches out for them...I think you know what I mean.  Nevertheless, I found the movie fun.  I didn't get bored, despite the horror cliches.  The acting is good.  It had a horror-twist ending that I sincerely didn't guess before the end of the movie, which is always a positive sign.  So, I feel it may be worth your time.",1170979200,,618,4.572727272727272
2664814,5,B000J103UW,"I don't understand why people continue these days to try and try to make a true haunted house movie that just does not make the grade over and over again.  This movie had such potential----The house was wonderful, London was an EXCELLENT place for this shoot and so was the plot BUT once again it has failed as a movie.  I understand that they want to draw the younger crowd but WHY must they ALWAYS typecast our ""future"" as stupid drugged out people?  We do have proof that Hollywood on occasion does put out a a few good horror movies such as Halloween 1978 (Micheal Myers rocks and you should get the 25th anniversary edition which features all the men who played him in all the films 1,2,4, 5,6 7,8 and who knows who will play him in 9), The Glass House (The Good Mother with Angie Harmon), The Others, The Hills have Eyes remake, Texas Chainsaw massacre remake, The Wrong Turn. But we all know that remakes fail badly too such as The Amityville Horror and The Omen but they at least make them well so we know it can be done so why on this earth are they producing such horrible films?  Yes, it is taking so much more these days to scare us in this horrible world but why can't Hollywood see (as with The Others) that all we (ages of 18 to 99) just want is a good haunted house movie that truly chills us to the bone and not all this crap they are putting out today?  The acting in this film was actually good (shocking, I know) but why did it fail?  London, an old scary house, a victorian plot (Candyman type plot revealed ----yes, but we all know it happened in Civil War times over and over again but that was our history and it makes an excellent plot with it's romantic lustful unmentionable love of that time)....... BUT a drugged out, vodka drinking crazy twosome totally ruins the whole thing with their stupid antics ........  As I walk into the rental store over and over again to catch a one in a million GOOD horror movie I have failed once again with this one............BUT I did rent it first unlike my stupidity in purchasing Living Death and Head Trauma.........Live and Learn is all I can say.......... Someday someone will make a true horror movie that ages 18 to 99 can say ""Job well done"" but until then I will stick to the old ones that have ACTUAL  meaning to the words HORROR (Haunted House MOVIE)..........a few suggestions on Haunted house movies: The Haunting 1963, Legend of Hell House, The Haunted, All the old Poe films, Ghost Story, The Uninvited 1944 (totally old fashion gothic horror and you will love it) The Amityville Horror 1979, The Legacy,......I could go on and on but you get the ""picture""........my advice ""ALWAYS rent them first"".......and the moment you put the DVD in the machine you will automatically know if it is worth your valuable time to sit through 2 hours of crap or two hours of true horror with actors who know actually know how to act.",1168128000,4,2898,4.444444444444445
2664815,1,B000J103UW,There is not even a fraction of a second of this film that is even remotely in the universe of being the slightest bit interesting...,1167177600,4,133,4.36

2664837,1,B000J103UW,I would not recommend to anyone. I chose the film because of Luke Mably. He may like making horror movies but his talent  was wasted.,1366329600,,133,4.32
2664838,4,B000J103UW,I got interested in Billie Piper from her role as Rose on Doctor Who.  I ordered this DVD because she starred in it.  I liked the movie.,1364688000,,136,4.0
2664839,4,B000J103UW,"Spirit Trap, starring the beautiful Billie Piper, was much better than I thought it would be. Unlike many haunted house type flicks, this one had a happy ending. I won't ruin things by going into details, but suffice it to say, okay plot, the only people to get offed were people you didn't care for anyway, and to top it off, Billie Piper.  Only complaint was that she stayed stubbornly dressed throughout the movie :)",1361836800,2,419,4.586666666666667

2664841,1,B000J103UW,"BORING. Thats all i can say about this one. is just VERY boring. I got about 15 minutes in it, and took it out of my DVD player. DO NOT reccomend.",1330387200,,146,3.7419354838709675
2664842,2,B000J103UW,"Part Thirt13n Ghosts, part Candyman, Spirit Trap is a low-budget British production with an attractive cast in a broken down house.  Five students - adorable Jenny (Billie Piper), drug dealing Tom (Luke Mably), his kinky girlfriend Adele (Emma Catherwood), creepy Tina (Alsou) and also adorable Nick (Sam Troughton) - move into a creepy London mansion. It is dominated by a spirit clock that, once Nick repairs it, begins counting down the time to a mysterious spiritual conjunction. As the clock ticks closer to the final hour, weird things start happening - Ouija boards work, mobile phones stop, water and shadowy mobs run through rooms.

As the creep-factor escalates, the various characters reveal their neuroses.  Tom and Adele have a sadomasochistic relationship that ping-pongs from lust to hate.  Jenny is the daughter of a spiritualist who ""killed herself"" (although we find out later that's not quite accurate). SPOILER TRAP: The twist is that the house is actually between dimensions of the living and the dead, which means there's some fun ""is-she-or-isn't-she"" moments where living characters turn out to have been dead all along and murdered characters get a second act.  As a stage play, Spirit Trap could be a lot of fun.

But this is a movie, and as such it demands levels of kinetic energy that never manifest.  It takes far too long to reveal who is really who and why the characters are all trapped in the house.  In between pointless character development, tawdry sex scenes, and horror retreads of other films, Spirit Trap throws in a plot about forbidden love and a racist lynching. It's hard to swallow, if only because Spirit Trap was never that deep to begin with.  Its history lesson on race relations (one that seems curiously out of place in Britain, but what do I know) feels a bit forced.

Still, there's a moment in Spirit Trap where the characters finally do the logical thing and run out the front door.  It's at that moment the movie finally lets its hair down and goes for broke.  But it takes so long to get there that you'll be counting the seconds along with the irritating clock that shares half the running time on screen.",1297814400,6,2164,4.8346883468834685
2664843,5,B000J103UW,"The movie itself is insane, but just describing the product...The item came just as described, played perfectly and I had no issues.  Everything was shipped quickly and I never needed to contact the seller.  If only I could get past the freaky storyline!",1292976000,,254,4.883720930232558
2664844,3,B000J103UW,"This was an entertaining movie, but it didn't break new ground or offer any real meat, so to speak.

All the actors were well cast. the plot is interesting and fairly easy to follow. Sometimes it was a little hard to understand the British accents, but you could still follow what was going on.

Most people will have guessed by 1/3 the way in who one of the characters really is.

I reccomend it for light horror fun. But don't expect much more than that.",1283126400,,456,4.341176470588235
2664845,2,B000J103UW,"like most of the other reviewers, i got this for billie piper.  her acting in this movie was okay.  the plot, being stuck in a haunted house and having some spirits haunt you and things going bump in the night, has been done a zillion times, and better.  there really isn't much horror, or a lot of action.  though ms piper is the main actress, i thought the supporting caste was average at best.  the extra has caste interviews which was quite boring.  all they did was pat each other on the back and had nothing but good things to say about their project.  it takes place in romania, which you'd never know since the whole focus of the movie is on this haunted house, that they all rented because it was close to college for them. very brief nudity (no, not billie), and heavy drug usuage (no, not billie) is in the movie.  rent, borrow or skip it, as you'll probably only watch it once or twice.",1260230400,,898,4.303571428571429

8148367,4,B000J103UW,"Okay, I really liked this movie. My boyfriend (who watchied it with me) thought it was terrible, and, objectively, I think he might be right, so take my rating with a grain of salt. I'm a sucker for anything with Billie Piper; plus I love haunted house movies. So I was pretty much set to like this one. It is pretty formulaic, and you'll probably figure out the ""twist"" long before the characters do. Still for Billie Piper fans and haunted house lovers, I definitely recommend giving this one  a shot. All others may not feel the same love love for it that I did.",1501113600,,565,4.380952380952381
