1631455,3,B00005NB8U,"""The Forsaken,"" a thoroughly conventional vampire movie.  This does not mean its bad - if you want to see a vampire movie, this one works very well.  Conventional these days does not mean bats and crosses - none appear.  It does mean chases at night across the desert, sexy vampires, a fair amount of blood, topless women, a cheesy ""how the vampires were created"" origin story and regular horror film ""boo's."" Think of 1998's ""Vampires"" and 1986's ""Vamp.""  If you're looking for more special effects ala ""From Dusk Til Dawn"" or ""Fright Night,"" or something deeper, like ""Shadow of the Vampire,"" look elsewhere.  But if you want chases in the desert and topless women, this does the job for cheap.",995846400,3,696,4.766666666666667

1631459,1,B00005NB8U,This movie took The Vampires (1998) James Wood and slimmed it down.  Low budget movie with low budget acting.  Its not a very good copy to boot.  The best part of the movie was the opening credits and I'm even ashamed to make that reference.  Its the part with the most nudity.  I can't think of a worse waste of time.,990489600,,318,4.147540983606557
1631460,4,B00005NB8U,"THE FORSAKEN is a horror/action thriller about a guy named Sean who is driving cross-country to attend his sister's wedding, and along the way he picks up a man named Nick who just happens to be a vampire hunter. Now, Sean is caught up in a battle with a gang of bloodthirsty vampires (The Forsaken), and things take a turn for the worst when Sean becomes infected with the vampire virus, and now he has to battle the undead in order to stay human. This movie had me on the edge of my seat, it has alot of plot twists, and good character development for the human and the vampire characters. This is definitly one of the best vampire movies to come out in the new millenium.",989625600,3,674,4.31496062992126
1631461,5,B00005NB8U,"I am a big fan of the Vampire film genre and thsi was the best I've seen in a long time.  I was worried it was gonna be a boring undead teeny bopper flick but I was very impressed.  I loved the slacker vampire hunter as it was a great change from the usual hard-edge vengeance hunter (Vampires), or the morose brooding quiet type (Vampire Hunter D).  He was actaully believable in the role which was something Corey Feldman never pulled off (Lost Boys).  The feeding scenes were great, very animalistic, and intense.  As a matter of fact the whole movie stayed pretty intense throughout.  Loved the Vampire henchmen characters, they really connected and contrasted well with their master.  The only thing I didn't like about this one was the unending, gratuitous nudity (ok five scenes isn't exactly unending).  I have no problem with nudity in films and sexuality is defniatley a must in a vampire movie but it kinda felt like hey you there look at these... ok lets go back to the movie.  All fans of the vampire genre (you know who you are) should see this one.",989107200,10,1063,4.552631578947368

1631496,4,B00005NB8U,"I saw this years ago and forgot the title; found it and bought it on Amazon. Ths movie is most enjoyable due to its male eye candy, but never shirtless, too bad. There is no overt affection shown between Fehr and Kerr, but it smoulders sub rosa. At the end when Kerr searches for Fehr and picks him up, I thought they might kiss in the car. Good action, good acting, good plot, good direction, and good dialogue; even Fehr's gratuitous explanation of the origin of vampires makes it, but just barely with credit to Fehr's acting ability. The DVD is recorded on both sides; however, with the same movie. I wonder why. The DVD case was so cheap that the disc was so difficult to remove, that it got scratched. I had to get a new box. These boxes are so badly designed that instead of protecting discs, they damage them. DVDs should be made out of non-scratchable plastic. After all these years we are back to playing records. I much prefer tapes: they are easy to record, they do not scratch, they can't be touched, they need not be cleaned, they never wear out, and always start where stopped even years later. I had to increase the brightness in order to see the great, sexy battle at the end - a nuisance. Why are some movies made so dark? I love the c. 1977 Mercedes-Benz SL450 Baumusterbezeichnung R107. I had a ride in one back then and loved it so much that I bought an SL500 R230, 30 years later when I could finally afford the $125K plus. I hated to see the SL450 destroyed. I hope a junk one was used for the damged shots. No one really cares how beat up the General Lee tin junk became.

Love it. Already watched it thrice.",1380931200,,1632,4.315960912052117
1631497,4,B00005NB8U,"This movie, starring CW alums Brendan Fehr and Kerr Smith (Roswell and Dawson's Creek, respectively) is a high-quality retread of the 80's classis Near Dark.  It keeps the bare bones of that earlier film's plotline (Young man out on his own finds himself drawn into a fight against vampires after being bitten) and brings it up into what was then modern times (late 90's/early 2000's).  The vampire mythology is changed/updated somewhat, the only remaining traditional ""rule"" seemingly that the vampires can be killed by sunlight/fire (and, in this version, only on sacred ground, due to the heretical nature of how they originally became vampiric creatures), also that one can (possibly) stave off the transformation after being bitten by taking a specific cocktail of medications (hello, HIV analogy).  Hence, the mission of our two leading guys (and their mostly catatonic but beautiful female companion) is to track down the source of their ""infection"", head vampire Kit (Jonathon Schaech) and destroy him, thus curing themselves once and for all (the drugs are only temporary and not guaranteed to help at all).

The atmosphere is striking (I think I have a thing for vampires in the desert) and the performances are all up to par.  Gritty, bloody, and unique among vampire films.

1631509,3,B00005NB8U,"A simple cross-country trip turns into a fierce battle for survival when a group of desert vampires set their sights and Sean and his new traveling companion in THE FORSAKEN. THE FORSAKEN borrows generously from films like NEAR DARK and John Carpenter's VAMPIRES, only to come off feeling unoriginal and uninspired. We spend the majority of our time with our hero Sean (Kerr Smith), who spends the entire time worrying about his car and making it to his sister's wedding despite the unholy terrors that are unfolding around him. Johnathon Schaech serves as a decent villain, but his vampire cohorts range from being minor annoyances to complete distractions. Phina Oruche's ungodly performance, in particular, detracts from everything else that is occurring on screen. The action and horror are both bland and predictable, and although the plot introduces some interesting new ideas to the vampire mythos, it frequently contradicts itself. If we are to believe that vampirism is a virus, why would killing the head vampire cure anyone that has been bitten? Overall, THE FORSAKEN is familiar and bloody enough to earn a passing grade for vampire fans.

This is one I'm happy to say is well made and acted.

Love Brendan Fehr, formerly from Roswell.  He has that rough edge, yet smooth, and has just the right stuff for a movie like this.  Great casting and all actors are very believable, and suited for their roles perfectly.  I have watched this movie several times and I never have gotten tired of it.  Easy to watch this movie several times as though it's the first time everytime.  If you love intensity, and for your stomach to rumble constantly, you'll love this.",1349568000,,626,4.6880733944954125
1631513,3,B00005NB8U,"I won't go in to great detail about the plot and merits of this film as others have done an exceptional job doing so. My contribution is around the odd and rampant woman-bashing in the film. I can deal with the gratuitous T&A (even if it is a bit silly when it's thrown in as if we're all 13 year old boys or as though this is a ""Porky's"" flick) but the constant use of ""b*tch"", ""wh*re"", ""sl*t"" and the like was more than a tad over the top. In fact, in one scene, as the heroes cross a bridge in the desert, there is a sign leaning against the bridge that reads simply, ""b*tch*--ya know, just 'cause, I guess. I'm not particularly sensitive, if at all, and deal well with blue humour or things that cross a line for satire or irony's sake, say, but, honestly, the woman-bashing/misogyny is pretty pervasive in this movie and it started to grate on my nerves after say, oh, the 15th time I heard a woman degraded with the ""b"" word.

Ok, apart from that large bit of aforementioned patheticness, as far as B-grade vampire flicks go, this one is pretty standard. The story line is standard (""I must kill the vampire that infected me before I 'turn'!""), the vampire back story is standard (some blah blah about Romanian soldiers from yesteryear who made a pact with a demon for immortality or something blahdy blah like that), the blood and gore scenes: Standard. The acting was actually quite decent. So if it's a Sunday afternoon and you're in the mood for some B-grade vampire fare that isn't gonna necessarily ""wow"" you with its cleverness but won't bore you with bad cinematography, bad acting, or a particularly terrible script, well you can't get much more average and ""meh"" than this film.",1348876800,,1694,4.517915309446254
1631514,3,B00005NB8U,"Far better than many will expect and yet nowhere near as good as it could have been, `The Forsaken' manages to have enough going for it to constitute digging in.  Sure, the biggest draw here is hotty Izabella Miko getting nekkid (and nekkid she gets) but there is something refreshing about a vampire hunter film that tries out new things, and this film actually tries to think outside the box in the way it approaches the genre and the typical confines found within it (while not completely successful).  The acting is decent, nothing truly outstanding, but the direction suits the formulaic nature of the film and gives a heft to some of the actionless sequences.  The tension of the themes presented carries through, and it totally latches onto the `gritty b-grade movie' ideal, so anyone contented within that genre will wholly enjoy this film.  I can still hear Coal Chamber when I drive by a dusty motel, so this film had some kind of impact.  It may not bring anything 'new', but it doesn't disappoint those with low expectations.",1303862400,,1037,4.770949720670391
1631515,4,B00005NB8U,"Sean (Kerr Smith) is your typical Hollywood worker who left L.A. on his way to see his sister's wedding in Flordia. Along the way, he picks up a hitcher named Nick (Brendan Fehr) who is actually a vampire hunter with some weapons and medicines to prevent infections from vampire bites, his mission is to hunt down every of the last remaining vampires whom been spreading a vampire disease to people for 500 years. They pick up lovely Megan (Izabella Miko) who was bitten by a vampire leader named Kit (Jonathan Schaech) with his clan called ""The Forsaken"" or otherwise known as the desert vampires out for blood.

Fun and trashy supernatural horror-comedy modern western from writer/director JS Cardone. Though derivative of Kathryn Bigewlo's 1987 masterpiece ""Near Dark"" to the 1986 cult fave ""The Hitcher"", this movie deals with vampirism as a disease as these ancient vampires caused the black plague in Europe long ago as they even create telegenetic abilities to their victims of telepathy. Here the vampires have no fangs but sharp as blades teeth but still has the same abilities like traditional vampires do. Miss Miko is quite sexy here and the whole cast shines, there is some good quality gore like a kickass exploding head sequence and the acting is average. If you want some campy and violent fun for your vampire needs then check out this one.

1631530,5,B00005NB8U,"Beginning with rather strange Scrapyard receptionist wearing skin tight spandex over her... let's just say 'somewhat wide' hips, and from her plastic neck brace that looks very uncomfortable, to her habit of tying up her hair with between ten to fifteen pencils sticking out of the crazy brown mop atop her head, from the mechanic with a southern accent in the middle of the Sonoran Desert Badlands of Arizona to his greasy smile and vomit inducing teeth, from the black and white old western movie playing on the TV in the motel scene (which combines sex with... well I won't spoil it) to the Shasta can on top on of the dashboard of an Arizona Cop (HUGE mustache included), from the blood dripping off of a soap container at a rest stop also in those same Arizona Badlands to the popsicle sucking motel owner who has his pet money fetch the room keys for his guests, from a real life former [...] playmate teasing and flashing Kerr Smith (Final Destination, Charmed, Justice, Dawson's Creek, E-Ring, as well as being on a number of VH1 shows including the insanely popular series 'I Love The 90's') as her car speeds away then disappears into a mirage created by the desert heat, to the brutal murder and torching of another cop - supposedly a Texas State trooper - right on his own car, from lizards being cooked and eaten as a side dish at a cafe in Tornillo, Texas, to the sex scene between two vampires in the back of their broken down car in which they choose not to swap spit but rather blood and... (well you get the picture)...

 From the acting of the modern 'B' movie king Johnathon Schaech (The Doom Generation, Little Chenier, Sea of Dreams, and That Thing You Do, as well as some of his 'B' Movie brilliance in films and sequals such as Road House 2, Finding Graceland, 8MM 2, Living Hell, Poison Ivy II, and Mummy an' the Armadillo - also directed by 'The Forsaken' director J.S. Cardone), and the real charisma of the young, talented Brendan Fehr (CSI:Miami, the critically acclaimed film Sugar, The Fifth Patient, the cult series Roswell, and as the field goal kicker in U2's music video 'Stuck in a Moment...'). All of the scenes and actors mentioned above are just a few of the many reasons 'The Forsaken' is a wild, brutal, often hilarious ride that must be seen to be believed. And enjoyed.
 Sadly, 'The Forsaken' marks the last appearance on the Big Screen of former Oscar nominee for Best Actress in 1970's 'Dairy of a Mad Housewife,' the late Carrie Snodgrass - who is also known for her work in 1998's 'Wild Things' (with Kevin Bacon, Neve Campbell, and Matt Dillon), 1994's 'Blue Sky' (with Jessica Lange and Tommy Lee Jones), and Clint Eastwood's 1985 cult classic 'Pale Rider' - who passed away on April 1st 2004. In this role, as a spooky widow living in the middle of nowhere who ends up helping out Fehr and Smith as they try to lure the vampires, which strangley enough also includes themselves as well, toward 'hallowed ground.' While you can tell Snodgrass is on her last legs, her performance alone (minimal yet important) is reason enough to see this film. All in all,  'The Forsaken' is rich with hilarious yet wonderfully rich characters, funny lines, occasional overacting - a staple of GREAT' 'B' Movies, and even the requisite (actually about five or six) nude scenes - all of gorgeous women).

 Izabella Miko of 'Save The Last Dance 2', Deadwood, and the music video for The Killers' hit ""Mr. Brightside', Simon Rex of Scary Movie 3 & 4, and Monarch Cove, Alexis Thorpe of Days of Our Lives and American Wedding, and British Actress and Supermodel Phina Oruche also star.

 If you're looking for a movie that makes a poignant social commentary and includes tremendous acting performances that were written about and were nominated for all the awards... this is not a film for you.
And if you were looking for a Horror film in the vain of the recent 'Wolf Creek', 'SAW' (1,2&3), 'Bug', 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) or Quentin Tarantino's 'Hostel' (1&2), where stories take a back seat to whatever the most twisted, disgusting, disturbing, sick torture can be done to a human, you'll probably be disappointed that you can actualy watch 'The Forsaken' while not worrying about losing your appetite, or whatever is in your stomach - all over your girlfriend, or couch or (God Forbid) your Mary Jane. 'The Forsaken' while not quite as good, really resembles another Tarantino project 'From Dusk 'Til Dawn' much, much, more than it does any of the other aforementioned movies.

 However, if you are a 'B' Movie Aficionado, love movies in the Horror/Thriller genre, specifically the recent flood of SLICK Hollywood Horror/Thriller films as well as other vampire movies, be it as far back as 'The Lost Boys' to present films such as 'The Grudge', 'Pulse', 'House of Wax' and the darker 'Underworld' movies that have made loads of money at the Box Office ('The Forsaken' was actually released 4-5 years before this trend (in 2001) and in many ways, it was done better) this movie is for you. If you love the briliance of the 'B' movie (Humourus, quirky, parts or performances hilariously bad one minute while minutes later it's so good you can't believe it's the same film, and the many other ways that 'Brilliance' is interpeted in the genre known as 'B' movies, you''ll have a blast watching this film. And if you have nothing better to do on a hot summer night, better if it's so hot every fan in the house is on, and you live either deep in the woods, on the ocean, or for authenticity... in the mddle of the desert you'll be very entertained. Or if it's a cold snowy day, or a rainy aftern... well you get my point).

 Grab a six pack of the beverage of your choice, or the cinema vice you like, be it popcorn, chocolate, gummi bears, or even some Mary Jane and enjoy a fun movie. As Well as the phenomenon that is Brendan Fehr's ohh so stylish mullet. He's Canadian, and I guess that is how he pulls it off so wel. Almost too well really, since my girlfriend wanted me to get mine cut just like that after she saw this film.

'The Forsaken' is a great time and a MUST for all Horror, Vampire, and especially all 'B' movie lovers.",1179532800,2,6176,4.61384335154827
1631531,3,B00005NB8U,"Written and directed by J.S. Cardone (Shadowzone, A Climate for Killing), The Forsaken (2001) stars Kerr Smith (Final Destination, ""Dawson's Creek"", ""Charmed""), Brendan Fehr (Final Destination, ""Roswell""), and Johnathon Schaech (Sol Goode, Road House 2: Last Call).  Also appearing is Izabella Miko (Coyote Ugly), Phina Oruche (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""), Simon Rex (Scary Movie 3), Alexis Thorpe (""Days of Our Lives""), and the late Carrie Snodgress (Pale Rider, Wild Things), in one of her last, feature films.

Kerr Smith plays Sean, a California resident in need of funds so that he may travel to Miami to witness his sister's wedding.  Lucky for Sean he's landed a gig driving a cherry $50,000 Mercedes to Florida, providing him not only with transportation, but a little dough to boot.  After a desert driving montage, Sean has some car trouble, is forced to stop off at a podunk town, and eventually ends up picking up a greasy hitch-hiker named Nick (Fehr), who looks like he's trying to grow a beard, but not very successfully as it's coming in all uneven and such...anyway, after a slight run in with some yahoos in a Dodge Charger, Sean and Nick end up picking up a spooky, strung out blonde named Megan (Miko), who doesn't actually say anything until like an hour and ten minutes into the film.  Turns out Megan's stony stupor is caused not by drugs, but by the fact she's been bitten by a vampire...and not just any vampire but an original vampire (played by Schaech), one being hunted by Nick, who's also been bitten and is using drugs to counteract the effects until he can track and eventually kill the source of the infection, freeing himself of the curse.  By the way, in the process of helping the girl, Sean also gets bit, so now he gets wrapped up in all the rigmarole.  Got all that?  Good...from here there's lots of scenes of Sean, Nick, and Megan in the car being chased by the vampire goons, and various flashbacks, including one detailing how Megan ended up the way she did.  Um, okay, so why do the vampires travel around in a late model Dodge Charger?  The car looks cool, I've give you that, but the vampires are forced into the trunk during the day (that is if they happen to be on the road) as their human sycophant drives them around.  Why not get an RV and black out the various windows?  Maybe vampires enjoy being stuffed into the trunk of a muscle car and being driven around in the Arizona sun, but I sure wouldn't.  Anyway, Sean and Nick are now forced to use Megan to lure the vampires into a trap, one where they hope to kill the main bloodsucker in an effort to free themselves of the sickness...

While The Forsaken, filmed in Arizona, wasn't necessarily a bad movie, it wasn't all that great, either.  I guess the main issue I had with the film was that it seemed to borrow too liberally from other films within the genre, specifically Blade (1998), with the whole taking drugs to counteract the effects of the vampire's bite, and Near Dark (1987), and it's southwestern theme (then again, if you haven't seen those two movies, most everything here will probably seem original).  Now it's not unusual for films to take from other films, but here it seemed so obvious, resulting in The Forsaken not really offering up anything new within the vampire mythos.  By the end of the film I didn't really take anything away from the experience of having seen it, so I began thinking of how the hour an a half watching the film could have been better spent.  The film is put together fairly well as the action, along with the gore, is spread evenly throughout, but there were times when the pacing dragged a bit.  Female fans, particularly those who watch shows on the WB, will probably enjoy the fact the film spends a lot of time with the two hunky male leads.  Male fans are thrown a bone as Izabella Miko does appear in various states of undress, including a few topless scenes.  I did find it odd the fact she appears early on in the film but then doesn't speak one line of dialog until about forty-five minutes later.  Johnathon Schaech made a pretty good vampire, but I had a hard time buying off on the hokum he was originally a knight of the crusades as he really didn't project the sense he was some 800 year old undead dude wandering the Earth all these years, surviving solely on his own intelligence (at some point in the movie we're fed a load about how the vampire strain originated during the crusades, and eight knights were initially infected with the disease).  Something else, given what I've seen in movies, I'd advise strongly against ever letting anyone drive your car across the country as chances are, it's going to be seriously trashed in the process.  As far as the performances, they weren't all that strong.  None of the female characters had much in the way of roles, and the male leads seemed hardly capable in carrying the film.  Schaech makes a good showing, hamming it up at times, providing at least something of interest.  The story felt kind of limp and predictable, something director Cardone was probably aware of given how he tried to spice things up with flashy visuals and lots and lots of quick cut sequences.  As far as the gore there was a decent amount of blood, along with a couple of entertaining effects including one where someone gets their melon popped with a shotgun...woo wee!  Thet head shore `nuff exploded good!  All in all there's really nothing new here, but if you really feel the need to see this film, you'd probably be better off renting it, as it's not one that lends itself to repeated viewings.  There are some good tunes included, if you're a fan of bands like Eve 6, Nickelback, Coal Chamber, Soulfly, and Uncle Kracker...

The picture, available in both widescreen anamorphic (1.85:1) and fullscreen (1.33:1), comes across well, and the Dolby Digital 5.1 audio comes through clearly.  As far as extras, there are subtitles in English, French, Chinese, Korean, and Thai, a director's commentary track, three deleted scenes, two featurettes, a theatrical trailer, and trailers for other films including Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), John Carpenter's Vampires (1998), Hollow Man (2000), and John Carpenter's Ghost of Mars (2001).

1631532,2,B00005NB8U,"The Forsaken (J. S. Cardone, 2001 )

I should probably know better by now. And yet I still subject myself to J. S. Cardone movies.

In this one, Sean, a guy (Dawson's Creek's Kerr Smith) hired to drive a car from Los Angeles to Miami picks up a hitchhiker, Nick (Final Destination's Brendan Fehr) in the middle of the desert. The two of them encounter Megan, a sick girl(Coyote Ugly's Izabella Miko) when they stop for the night in town. Nick insists she come with them, saying he knows what's wrong with her, and eventually tells Sean that the group have vampires on their tail. (Well, the word ""vampires"" doesn't exactly crop up seriously, but come on, you know what they are.) The rest of the movie can be summed up with ""things blow up.""

Cardone is one of the straight-to-Sci-Fi-Chanel directors who fills his movies with young-and-beautifuls who have limited (if any) acting ability, but are relatively easy on the eyes. (In their defense, this is not a new tactic; witness the brilliant film career of, say, Farrah Fawcett.) Smith is a bit above the average y-n-b in acting ability, though the other two here are right on the mark. The minor characters don't have much to go on, either, as the script came straight out of a ""write your first screenplay in twenty-one days"" kind of book. Which could make a passable film if you had a really original, or even a really good, fast-paced plot. Alas, no such thing exists here.

This movie deserves a mercifully quick slide into obscurity. About the only was I can imagine it having any longevity at all is if it's somehow turned into a drinking game. * ",1139184000,,1606,4.601398601398602

But I am always open minded to all sorts of films, so I thought I would give this one a whirl. It started out with some potential, but within the first 20 minutes I knew it was going to be hopeless. I should have just turned the darned thing off. It was so unrealistic (ok, I know it's a vampire movie, so what did I expect) but I just didn't believe that the main character (Kerr) would have done the things he ended up doing thru out the movie. And then the girl (Izabella Miko) who had about 8 lines in the movie; that was just lame and pointless. She must have felt like such a loser telling people, yeah, I'm in this movie ""The Forsaken"", and I'm in it almost the entire time...but....ahhh....well just call me zombie girl.

Also avoid the urge of trying to be too helpful to fellow motorist stranded along the way, remember things are not always what they appear to be.

This was quite a well-constructed, coherent storyline from beginning to end. You are never left in the dark with this plot. Everything is explained at the appropriate time, the history of this particular vampire sect, how they happened to show up in Midwest America, how the vampire virius works in the body, its telepathic properties and what must be done to cure yourself from the curse of ""The Forsaken."" All this infomation was nicely worked into the script in such a way as not to bog down the viewer with too much substance, hence detracting from what the average movie fan is looking for, gore and violence.

A brief comment for any young girls who may get struck watching this movie with a male friend. While you may not enjoy the horror elements in the movie you might enjoy the male members of the cast which includes; Brendan Fehr (Roswell), Kerr Smith (Dawson's Creek, Final Destination) and Johnathon Schaech (That Thing You Do) as the head vampire.

Brendan Fehr was terrific as the young, wise beyond his years vampire hunter roaming the highways and byways in search of the vampire that infected him with the virius. My favorite scene in the movie is when Nick (Brendan Fehr) and Sean (Kerr Smith) stop at a roadside diner for a bite to eat. A two-way conversation quickly turns into a monologue when Nick begins to compare the aspirations and hopes of his generation with those of the last. It's not only hilarious, but absolutely true. Without giving away too much of the ending, I'll just say a perfect opening was provided for a sequel. While I'm not generally a fan of sequels, I would've liked to see Brendan Fehr reprise his role of vampire hunter at least one more time.

Simply the most enjoyable vampire film since ""The Lost Boys.""",1121904000,22,2046,4.659279778393352

If your looking for an amazing vampire movie then your not going to find it in this and if you don't look Brendan Simon or Kerr then you'll probably hate this movie, if theyd used other people it would suck terribly honesty its a waste of talent..if ur looking for something good don't watch this..",1104451200,2,587,4.25
1631536,3,B00005NB8U,"In a film starring Kerr Smith, Brendan Fehr, and a host of other actors and actresses considered eye-candy, you'd think this would be another teen/vampire/T&A rompfest.  Well, there are vampires and definitely some T&A, but the ""teen"" element is nowhere to be found.  Instead, you have a decent story about a small band of bloodsuckers headed up by one of the original badboys of immortality who is being hunted by one of his victims.

The victim, played by Brendan Fehr, thinks that the vampire Kit is the source of the virus he acquired through another vampire.  According to legend, if you kill the source before you vamp out, you will be cured of what ails you.  Kerr Smith plays Sean, a guy who winds up in the wrong place at the wrong time.  He is thrust into the hunt when he assists Fehr's character, Nick.  They find a young woman(Izabella Miko of ""Coyote Ugly"") who is a recent victim of Kit, and they use her as a homing beacon to draw Kit to holy ground, which is the only place that he can be killed.

Kit is played with sinister perfection by Johnathan Schaech.  Schaech and his little group of vampires, which includes his lover, another female vampire, and a day driver, decide to hunt the hunters and finish them off.  What follows is a standard road movie/car chase sequence that is full of explosions, nudity, gore, and a big finale.

Although it doesn't hold up well to many other vampire flicks, ""The Forsaken"" is worth a watch.  There is plenty of T&A, but not so much that you think you're watching some late night fluff on Showtime.  The violence is handled pretty good as well, though some may be turned off by the way the vampires feast.  They can get pretty violent when they are feeding.  If you like your vampires along the line of ""Lestat,"" you probably won't like this movie.  If ""Blade"" is more to your liking, you might enjoy this movie more, although there are no martial arts-induced [...] whippings.  As a matter of fact, this movie reminded me a lot of ""The Wraith,"" due to the fact that there are plenty of desert car chases.

Oh, and by the way, the Forsaken is Kit, who just happens to be one of the original eight French vampires that started all of this vampire mess in the first place.  Bram Stoker would role over in his grave.",1103760000,9,2271,4.495121951219512
1631537,4,B00005NB8U,"I bought this movie when I was on a serious vampire-story kick, and it got here as that kick was waneing. So I put off watching it, because frankly the cover looks like every other silly sex-kittens-and-bloodsuckers vamp flick out there, just done with today's teenagers instead of last decade's teenagers. I have nothing against s-k-&-b-s films, but I have to be in a specific mood to want to watch them.

Today, I decided to get off my behind (or rather, to sit *on* my behind... ), stop stalling because I was afraid of how bad it might be, and actually watch it. My expectations were very, very low. I was pleasantly surprised.

It's done fairly well - the characters mostly hold together. The bits where they go all ""Natural Born Killers"" with the filming are as lame as in every other film that's used them, but the rest is decently done and competently acted.

All in all, it's a pretty darn good job. They could have gone and screwed it up but they didn't. And for Hollywood, that's a major achievement.

If I say anything about the plot I might give something away, and that would actually be a shame, because there is a sort of plot and it doesn't go strictly according to the standard script. It sticks close and does involve a bunch of pretty, pimple-free early twenties kiddies wearing as little as possible but still; it manages to have a few shreds of originality.

Kerr Smith is effectively heroic and Brendan Fehr, while still looking a little wet behind the ears, is a convincing vampire hunter.
Having traveled cross country four times, I could empathize with the loneliness of those desert highways, so that heightened the suspense for me.

1631540,3,B00005NB8U,"At the beginning of ""The Forsaken"" we are treated to a scene in which a naked young woman in a shower covered in blood cleans off one of her breasts.  This really has nothing to do with this 2001 film beyond the symbolism of uniting blood and sex (if you think about it, the film literally makes a clean breast of it).
Before we get to the actually plot of this film what we have as the chief selling point are a pair of young studs from the WB network at the top of the credits, namely Kerr Smith from ""Dawson's Creek"" and Brendan Fehr from ""Roswell.""  Smith is Sean, who edits trailers in Hollywood and is now driving somebody else's Mercedes convertible across the country to attend his sister's wedding.  Fehr is Nick, who seems to be just some slacker bumming a ride but is in reality much, much more.  We just do not figure out what until they encounter Megan (Izabella Miko), who is acting weird at a bus stop.  Not only is she the blonde from the beginning of the film, but it turns out that she has been bitten by a vampire.  Nick knows this because a year ago he was bitten by the same vampire, but he has a magic drug cocktail that has stopped him from making the change.  Now the guys have to save Megan from the same fate of living death.
Anne Rice, P. N. Elrod, Laurell K. Hamilton and Joss Whedon have all dealt in different ways with making the vampire mythos work in more modern terms.  J.S. Cardone, writer and director of ""The Forsaken,"" tries to do the same thing but the result is something of a mess.  The vampires in this movie are basically something akin to the Manson Gang, which is easy enough to grasp, but it is the new and improve rules on how you avoid turning into a vampire that really requires copious note taking, although that becomes rather pointless once we discover that one of the ways to stem the transformation is to pour buckets of ice on a half naked woman in a bathtub.  The goal is ultimately to kill Kit (Jonathan Schaech), the leader of the vampire pack, because that will break the cycle (sort of convenient, huh?).  But before that can happen there is plenty of blood-letting and you know that beautiful Mercedes is going to take a pounding.
At least ""The Forsaken"" takes itself seriously, although there are times where that works to the disadvantage of the film.  Kerr is passable enough in the role of the basically good guy to whom all sorts of weird things are suddenly happening, but Fehr just does not have the presence to make his role and the rest of the movie works (every time I look I him I keep thinking he should be playing the young Fox Muldar on an ""X-Files"" flashback).  The film is bloody and gory for those who like such things, although none of it is particularly memorable.  The problem is that I perked up at the idea of some new twists on the idea of the vampire, but that just called attention to the most problematic elements of the film.

1631565,2,B00005NB8U,"With the seemingly endless line of B-horrors being churned out it's difficult to find something original, and 'The Forsaken' proves this point.  It's a road movie-cum-vampire flick that many have rightly compared to 'Near Dark', although it also pays a lot of allegiance to 'John Carpenter's Vampires'.  Kerr Smith makes the move over from 'Dawson's Creek' with barely any noise at all, as he plays Sean, a guy taking a vintage Mercedes (of course, all cars in road movies are nice ones) across dusty roads when he picks up hitchhiker Nick (Fehr).  As it turns out, Fehr is a vampire hunter, trying to find and kill 'The Forsaken', a group of vampires that hark back to medieval times, in an effort to slow the spread of their virus.  The two also take Megan (Miko) along for the ride, a past victim that they know the group of roadhog vamps will track down.  So we've got the set-up, with the gang equal parts hunting and running away.
What's good about the movie is that it's reasonably gory, and the opening scene could even be described as pretty disturbing, although in the horror field 'pretty' disturbing isn't always a complement.  The acting is acceptable too, and there's no hints of irony or postmodernism, which is pretty nice.  Unfortunately we're left with a meandering plot that never really explains itself - why exactly do some of the vampires have to be killed on hallowed ground, and why exactly does an old woman have a cemetary in her back yard in the middle of nowhere.  Even the nature of the vampires remains mysterious, and we never get to see any fangs.
Teen road movies often have trouble finding an audience, and it's not hard to see why this had trouble making an impact at the box office.  You'd be much better seeking out 'Near Dark', or the more recent 'Jeepers Creepers' and 'Joy Ride', all of which are infinitely better than something this unimaginative and dull.

It's about a boy Kerr Smith, who picks up a wrong guy on the road in spite of his better judgement.  But this time it's not Rutger Hauer that he picked up; it's Brendan Fehr of TV series ""Roswell"", who looks like a good-natured hitchhiker, so why not?  Of course, he shouldn't have, but not for another reason.
When this unlucky pair (who are both in ""Final Destinations"") meets creepy Johathon Schaech on the road, the story shows what it wants to be.  However, though up until this part the film goes with a good pace, it begins to betray that it has nothing to add more.  In fact, this is only a modernized version of ""Near Dark"" by Kathryn Bigelow, or I should say it wants to be that cult film.  But except some (or many) nudity scenes, there is nothing new or original in this one.  The idea of vampire virus tranmitted through bite; vampires bursting into flame in the sun; and the vampire leader that leads the vampire pack that prey on the travellers ... please.  I didn't like ""Near Dark"" very much, but it boasted stylish images and terrific Lance Henriksen.
Sorry for my unkind review, but the director has made considerable numbers of works in the past, so I have to be.  When you see the shower scene (with blood) of Izabella Miko (""Coyote Ugly"") at the flashy opening sequence, and the film won't let her do anything but screaming and tossing and turning after that; when you see an obligatory car-chase scene or blown-up house without any logical development of story, we know there's something definitely wrong with the film.",1025740800,,1790,4.621451104100946

The movie is nothing but kids stuff... there is no suspense, thriller or horror! There is nothing but topless girls and so much blood. Even the make-up is silly.
It's one of the worst movies I ever saw. If I want to name a list of worst thriller movies, it would go like this:

2. From Dusk til dawn.

Kerr smiths character starts off on his way to delivering a car when a guy asks for a lift. Cue a car full of really strange people who seem to be following them. Kerr soon realises that he is infected as well as 2 other people and will soon turn into a vampire. It's a race against time to kill the vampires and save themselves.
What I like most about this movie is the location it takes place. There's nothing as scary as driving along a deserted highway that seems neverending. If you needed help it could be hours, you've got a car full of killer vampires on your tail and your nearly on your last legs as it is - truly terrifying!
This movie is non stop thrills from begining to end. The gore and use of make up effects is truly believable and the cast make The Forsaken a real class movie.",1017964800,3,1018,4.225641025641026

1631571,3,B00005NB8U,"Movie Summary:  Sean is driving from Los Angeles to Florida in order to deliver a car and attend his sister's wedding. He's on a tight schedule but everything will turn out fine as long as he sticks to the number one rule: No Hitchhikers. But is someone a hitchhiker if they help you pay for gas? Sean tries to convince himself that they aren't as he allows Nick to come along for the ride as long as he pays. It's no surprise that along with Nick comes a world of trouble, a dark and evil world.
My Opinion:  I have a habit of not watching the trailer or reading the summary on the slipcase before I watch it. So I go into a movie with a clean slate. A lot of trailers ruin the movie, as do the slipcase summaries. So I knew that The Forsaken was a horror movie, but not much else. Would it be hypocritical for me to tell you that it's a vampire movie? I'm going to say no, because you've obviously decided to read some reviews before watching and/or purchasing this DVD. There isn't too much new to the vampire legend here nor in the way the good guys fight them. They throw in a few minor twists, but nothing too original. The three male leads do a good job keeping the story tight and believable. Brendan Fehr is very cool as the mysterious Nick who is hot on the trail of the lead vampire. Kerr Smith is believable as Sean who has a very hard time believing the world he has stumbled across. Finally, Johnathon Schaech is delightfully evil as one of the forsaken. In the end I was mildly entertained by this solid B movie. There are better, but there are a lot worse as well.

1631585,5,B00005NB8U,"I saw ""The Forsaken"" in theaters last May, and I loved it, I thought it was a great film. ""The Forsaken"" is a story about Sean (Kerr Smith) who is going cross-country to deliver a car to a guy in Florida, and on his way he picks up a lone hitchhiker, Nick (Brendan Fehr). The two pick up a strange girl who has just been bitten by a vampire, and while trying to help her, Sean gets bitten by the lady they picked up. And so the threesome are out to stop the head vampire so that they can prevent becoming vampires. The plot is semi-original, the acting was believable, the direction was pretty good, and the film overall was great, but the dvd was disapointing. When I saw the packaging and the special features that were on the dvd, it made me want to get ""The Forsaken"" even more, plus the price was right, so I bought it. I finally watched it today, and the features were good but not what I expected. The 3 deleted scenes were good, one is where Nick tells Sean about his childhood, I felt that one should have been included in the film, because it adds charecter-development. Another deleted scene has Nick and Sean leaving a diner and Sean asks Nick if crosses, garlic, ect. work on vampires, and the final one has a confrontation between the head vampire and Izabella Miko's character. All 3 deleted scenes equal roughly 4 minutes. And there are trailers for ""The Forsaken"", ""Hollow man"", ""Vampires"", ""Dracula"",
and ""Ghosts of Mars"". The real let-down was the two making-of features, one is a profile of Brendan Fehr which is about 2 minutes, and the other is about the Mercedes used in the film, and who they filmed one of the vampires death scenes and is roughly 2 and a-half minutes. Usually featurettes are atleast 5 minutes, both of these combined aren't even 5 minutes long.
Overall, ""The Forsaken"" is worth buying alone just to see a great vampire flick, but if you're looking for special features, they are there, but are relatively short and disapointing. ""The Forsaken"" is for vampire and horror film fans, but those who aren't into those types of movies may want to stick with a rental.",1003881600,2,2104,4.524934383202099
1631586,3,B00005NB8U,"The Forsaken, a group of vampiric like individuals that go back to the Crusades. There are 8 of them to be destroyed. Four have been killed, 4 remain. And it's up to a group of people who are brought together to destroy one of the remaining.
 The first mistake made with The Forsaken is it being compared to The Lost Boys and Near Dark. It's nowhere near those two gems, but in its own way, The Forsaken is actually pretty good. The whole cast gave very good performances. Kerr Smith deserved his lead role. The action sequences are tense, and are never over the top. The final showdown between bad and good is worth the watch, although it falls kind of short. The backstory given for the vampires is another interesting bit added to Hollywood vampire lore, and is one of the most interesting one to come along lately.
 The second mistake is, well, there's no second mistake. The Forsaken didn't do so great in theatres because people thought they've seen this formula before. But I believe they movie didn't fail in any of it, and did a good job at keeping you interested. I believe The Forsaken could not have been any worse or any better. It is what it is.

They were doing more so shooting and hunting than flying around and feeding off these people. I didn't see any fangs or any other indications that they were vampires besides the fact that they were attracted to the sight of blood and they could let sunlight hit them.

Suprisingly well done the movie is about a guy who picks up a hitchiker who happens to be bounty hunter looking for vampires known as The Forsaken. Along the wya they encounter them so the whole movie is filled with their attempts to get away from them. The acting is actually good and the plot is exciting and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Lots of gore, blood, feasting on humans, human hearts, and a schocking scene of a head of a vamp being blown off. Jonathan Scheach is perfectly evil as the head of The Forsaken .

For some strange reason, this vampire movie doesn't really focus that they are vampires.  Unlike other vampire movies these ones don't turn into demons like Lost Boys etc.  They came off as canibals more then dead demons.
Brendan Fehr did a good job as the lead, and Kerr Smith character as Vampire Hunter was good as well.  Looks like they wanted to make a series out of this movies, but I really didn't get into those two that much.  After the movie was over I didn't feel the want to see another chapter.  Smith was good, but he needed to more ""Han Solo"" like personality to get behind.  He was straight forward and you didn't really ralley behind him that much.
Editorial review says using a girl as telepath to the vampires was new to vampire stories.  But its is not.  John Carpenters ""Vampires"" they did the same thing.  Actually this movie is near similar to that movie, but way lower budget.

Since I wasn't expecting ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" none of that mattered to me, and I thoroughly enjoyed the film.  For the type of movie it is, it's a good one.  Brendan Fehr is fittingly ""bad boy,"" and Kerr Smith plays the role of a befuddled cynic quite well.  The girl, in my opinion, was entirely unnecessary, and they only threw her in to have a blonde with breasts.

7946686,4,B00005NB8U,"Caution! Spoilers! Got this with in a four-movie set ""Blood Sucker Collection"" (The Breed, The Cave, The Forsaken, and Vampires: The Turning). Definitely the movie makers have been trying to find every imaginative way possible for would-be heroes to ""do in"" vampires. But what if as part of the plot, the attempt to ""do in"" the ""monster"" goes awry? And the would-be hero may one day discover that he (or she) missed?

Two such movies in which the ""monster"" in effect ""gets away"" are ""Pardon Me but Your Teeth Are In My Neck: The Fearless Vampire Killers"" and ""House of Dark Shadows"". In each film, one or maybe more of the ""creatures of the night"" get away. In ""Pardon"", of course, the female lead (played by Sharon Tate whose real life ended so tragically, may she truly rest in peace) goes into ""transish mode"".

In ""House"", the trick is a little obscure, but if you are acquainted with the original ""Dark Shadows"" TV soap opera, there are a number of occasions with stakes and shootings with arrows. In one scene in the show, having been shot with an arrow (off center to the left of the heart), the lead character himself gives this condescending smile, pulls out the arrow, and in a gruff voice tells the would-be hero, ""You missed."" Thus, at the end of ""House"", as the ""dialog"" is chittered (as if laughing) by a bat-like flying form, you know what the last line really is: ""You missed."" (The would-be hero had to have been missed. The arrow went in far left of his heart to begin with, from the back this time by the way. The actor who played the lead role had to be back in the studio Monday morning, per various commentaries. The character had to continue!)",1489881600,,1666,4.53156146179402
