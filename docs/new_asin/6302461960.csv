8226910,5,6302461960,"This is one of the best produced NFL Films productions ever done.  The combination of precise editing, perfect music, and classic footage is all there in this one.  In particular the features on Walter Payton (RIP) and Lawrence Taylor are amongst the best ever done on those two all time greats.  The video catalogues the progression of hitting and physical play throughout NFL history, showing footage of the savage early years up until the best players of the 1980s era.  This is an excellent video for the life long NFL fan or the novice wanting to learn what the NFL is about.  This production stands up well today, unlike many NFL Films Super Bowl videos which use dated music, and poor editing techniques.  Some people may be disappointed it ends in the 80s but the historical footage is so perfectly edited and collected that it's truly a classic NFL Films production.  I Hope this production ends up on DVD one day.",1117238400,4,923,4.695652173913044
8226911,5,6302461960,"Ouch!  This is a fantastic video showing just how tough you have to be to survive in the NFL especially in the beginning when the guys wore thos crazy leather helmets!  Aside from the hits, it's really great to see how  much respect the players have for each other, Dick Butkus is held in  especially high regard for being a mean, fierce, aggressive player.  Although it's looking a bit dated now, Crunch Course remains, for me, a  truly great football film.",957312000,6,458,4.592592592592593
8226912,5,6302461960,"The Crunch Course is one of the best no frills videos on hits in the NFL that I've seen.  There's no joking around with ""follies"" or any smut like that.  This is a must see for true fans who are looking for  blood-curdling hits!",947116800,3,228,4.136363636363637
