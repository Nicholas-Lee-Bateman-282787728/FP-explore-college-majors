8308104,3,B001H74AT2,"This tape includes a complete half-hour (well, 24 minutes) episode of the Care Bear Family show.  The villain of this series is wizard No Heart, who in this episode has Beastly kidnap little Hugs and Tugs bears to lure the other bears (and cousins) to another battle, one he thinks he can win.  Often, two stories fit into a half-hour show...this story takes up the whole half hour.

A small segment about sharing follows the main story.  A brief mention of Care-A-Lot's history occurs in the story...it is the town's birthday, as seen in the tape's title.  If you have fond memories of this series, you'll probably enjoy this, but it is too scary to consider showing to my preschooler, and she's the only one impressed by this show in my house.  Maybe Hugs and Tugs are not scared of No Heart, but he is too scary for many toddlers and too predictable for anyone else.",1226793600,,869,4.538461538461538
