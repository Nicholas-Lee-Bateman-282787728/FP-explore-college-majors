958159,3,6305068429,Not a masterpiece by any stretch but worth watching.  It kind of reflects the early 30's and the values of the time.  I believe this was released just before the peak of Benny's success and popularity.,1416182400,,201,4.555555555555555
958160,4,6305068429,"The musical scenes were very innovative.  Cast great '30's stars.  Funny, romantic, mystery.  Very enjoyable way to pass an evening.  Especially for old timers like me.  This was the second time I watched it.",1405900800,,208,5.0
958161,4,6305068429,"A cute little ""who done it"" or ""who stole it"". Crooks trying to out swindle each other, a muddy romantic interest or two.  Did they really get those extravagent shows on a boat?",1395273600,,177,4.363636363636363

958163,3,6305068429,This is an odd film to find comedian Jack Benny.  Benny plays a band leader working on a luxury liner.  There are several sub plots in what is not a very funny shipboard musical.,1380758400,,178,4.205882352941177
958164,5,6305068429,"This is a great very early Jack Benny film. It has a lot of charm and is fun to watch. The several songs throughout the movie written by Richard A. Whiting and Sydney Clare are to die for especially what might possibly be the very first Rock n Roll song titles ""Rock and Roll."" Worth watching for the great soundtrack and its nostalgic beauty.",1364083200,4,343,4.375
958165,5,6305068429,"This little gem of a movie is getting harder and harder to find.  It is almost 70 years old.  All of the stars in this film may have been well known then but they, except for Jack Benny, are almost all unknown to viewers today.
The story is centered around a well known actress and a thief that fall in love on the cruise.  She has connections to a crime boss and is trying to protect her criminal brother from the same crime boss he owes money to.  The thief begins by stealing on board the boat and swindles
and steals from just about everybody he sees along with his partner who works on ship as a steward.  A police detective on vacation begins to figure what the thief is up to and later on attempts to solve the murder of the crime boss.  In the end all the loose ends are tied up and the thief and the actress resolve their differences and move forward with their relationship.
The story is good and the support case is great.  Jack Benny plays a well know radio personality that is providing the ship board entertainment along with the rest of his cast and staff.  He is the quick witted, street smart good guy that has everyone pegged and helps to direct the other passengers in the right direction.
This film has several good musical numbers, typical of the day, and the comedy holds up well by todays standards.  If you are able to locate this film or see that it is being aired give it a try.  My guess is that you will be glad that you did.",1062720000,13,1453,4.212996389891697

958248,5,6305068429,"I love these old movies.  Good clean language, with humor, suspense, love, plus good guys vs bad guys, and redemption for some of the bad guys.
So, for all you Cop haters,  there was a very Good Cop in this movie who knew the bad guy could be saved.  Just an all around fun movie.
Thank you AMAZON for having these good old movies.  Keep them coming.  I am considering dropping our netflicks subscription as they just don't have much for good old movies like this.",1445558400,,464,4.348837209302325

958300,5,6305068429,This old classic has everything from humor to mystery to romance to a Broadway show.  One has to pay attention and keep pace with all that happens since there are all sorts of side stories that get pulled into one big tale.  The acting is good and entertaining.  If you like classic movies you'll enjoy this one.  Definitely a different era but definitely fun.,1435968000,,360,4.578125

7881811,4,6305068429,"A fun flic that while dated is still fun to watch.  It has a clever opening with a murder taking place, then  the movie does a flashback to 48 hours earlier to set up the events. Hopefully there are still a few people alive who will still recognize Jack Benny (Chad Denby) but I fear the other actors are all forgotten such as Gene Raymond (Jimmy Brett) and Nancy Carroll (Sally Marsh).  The whodunit is easy to figure out as the killer announces his intentions early in the film.  But the film has some great dialogue and witty repartee that still gets a laugh.  And there is a song/dance number that is right out of Busby Berkeley and is alone worth a watch. No doubt this was a B picture but it deserves an audience.",1468540800,,719,4.296296296296297
7881812,2,6305068429,"trying to keep track of all the characters will keep you awake, even if the story is a yawner.
Watchable cast.
Couldn't really get into the love story. A  guy who is a con man & womanizer gets the sweet girl.
Have watched movies like this for years & am beginning to realize how media influences the way we think & watching stupid just makes us stupid
and now I'm just feeling stupid for having watched this !
It would have been nice if Jack Benny had gotten the girl !",1468454400,,469,4.153846153846154

7881816,3,6305068429,This is an old 1930's movie about the death of a mobster on a cruise ship.  There are a few suspects and theft of jewels that also occurs on the ship.  This is a comedy and I genuinely liked it.  The movie is funny and goes by pretty quickly.,1465776000,,242,3.8979591836734695

7881819,4,6305068429,"This is a rare gem of a film from 1934 !  It combines mystery, comedy, romance, murder, and, a dance number that Busby Berkley would have loved to create !!

The cast is a ""who's who"" of 1930's film & radio stars: Jack Benny, Gene Raymond, Sidney Blackmer, Ralph Morgan, Robert Elliott, two beauties Nancy Carroll & Mitzi Green, songs from the Boswell Sisters & Frank Parker, and comedy from Patsy Kelly & Sid Silvers.

The plot deals with the ""Underworld of Show Business"" as a cruise ship hits the ocean...murder & blackmail are on the list of surprises we get, and, Jack Benny is the leader of a troupe of radio performers that entertain the passengers aboard and broadcast live on the cruise.

I won't spoil the outcome, or, giveaway any more of plot...I'll just say I had never seen this before !  Didn't know it existed, but I watched from scene-to-scene and the script had SO many shifts & changes to the action that I was truly amazed that the cast carried it off so well.

One thing to watch for: On the last night of the cruise (as most cruise's even due today) all of the passengers were invited to a farewell dinner & a dynamite, boffo floor show that will blow you away !  The final musical & dance number is an extravaganza...a sight to behold !  It would make Busby Berkley, himself, ""turn green with envy"" at how meticulously perfect it was executed !!  The special effects, superb editing, and, mystical, magical way this scenario is carried out is simply amazing...I had to watch that section of the film alone THREE TIMES to see if I could figure out how it was done.  And, NO I won't give away the secret...you'll just have to watch it for yourself !!

This is an Art Deco-lovers delight !  The Art Director, John Ducasse Schulze, responsible for the overall ""feel"" of every set on this film, and the creator of those fantastic clinging, backless, 1930's Hollywood Gowns worn in the Ballroom scenes, Gwen Wakeling, both deserved to be nominated for Oscar's for their work on this film !!

If there is one problem with this movie it's that it's about 10-15 minutes too long; that's why I gave it 4 Stars instead of 5. The director & the writers should have trimmed-out a few of the redundant by-play scenes, rehashing-of-events scenes, et al, that kept the action from moving forward.  BUT, that's not a ""deal breaker""...you should see this film if you want a look at what was happening over 80 years ago in a movie flush with those in radio & film who were stars, and those who were on their way to becoming stars !",1464825600,,2535,4.494553376906318
7881820,2,6305068429,"Perhaps most interesting for the historical backgrounds.

Jack Benny fans might enjoy seeing him playing a different (although similar) character.",1464652800,,146,6.3
