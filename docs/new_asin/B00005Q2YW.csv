The Indian guide told the little girl she had lived a past life, so there was a reference to reincarnation. The guide talked about mother earth and being one with the earth, so the movie is pushing the New Age Movement. Basic plot: two smart kids and one not-so-smart kid defend themselves against bumbling escaped cons while lost in the forest.",1474070400,,373,4.828125

7949787,2,B00005Q2YW,"The Legend of Wolf Mountain is a mediocre attempt at making a viable family film about the wonder and beauty of nature. Unfortunately, it seems to get caught up in a plot of kids outsmarting the bad guys ala Home Alone. Since the movie is from 1992, it's understandable that it has that element, since everyone started getting on the Home Alone bandwagon and capitalizing on it's formula for many family movies in order to ensure interest among kids. There are plenty of 'the kid's screaming like Macaulay Culkin' moments and it's riddled with cliches and terrible direction and subpar acting.

Three kids are kidnapped by escaped convicts who have just robbed a credit union and let loose into the wilderness only to be continuously hunted again by the bungling burglars and have moment after moment at gunpoint foiled in various ways by the kids or the spirit of the Native American protector of the land who takes the form of a wolf or a man depending on the scene. Sounds interesting, right? Wrong. It could have been great but being a low budget (or is it NO budget) movie it comes off as repetitive and insipid.

The most perplexing and ridiculous moment comes when the spirit of the Indian becomes solid flesh and blood once again in order to wrestle, punch and otherwise kick the bad guys' butts. It just doesn't get any worse than that, and that SHOULD have been the end of it, but then we have to endure MORE of a finale with MORE cliches and it just seems to drag on forever. If you're into this type of film, trust me when I tell you, It's one for the 'skip it' list. Check out my other reviews for much better alternatives in this genre. 2 stars for the valiant attempt at a lesson of importance regarding respect for our wondrous land, otherwise this film should receive NO stars. Two thumbs WAY WAY down.",1405209600,,1819,4.5426829268292686
7949788,3,B00005Q2YW,"Good story for an eight or nine year old, simple story of good verses evil. The ""white hats"" win and the ""black hats"" lose, all delivered with a minimum of violence. Acting, poor. For a child viewer, OK",1369958400,,202,4.342105263157895
7949789,5,B00005Q2YW,Haven't had time to watch it yet.  Watch a lot of these movies with the grandkids.  Looks like a movie that doesn't have violence and foul language.,1357603200,,148,4.444444444444445

7949791,4,B00005Q2YW,"This was not at all what i expected. I love wilderness type movies, this didn't seem to be one but was good so i continued. I wound up being quite a good movie. Cute at times also. Scarry at times too.",1285027200,,201,3.926829268292683

7949793,4,B00005Q2YW,"This movie was enjoyed by the whole family.  It made me think of the Disney movies I watched as a child.  Adventure, comedy and peer influence are the first things that come to mind.  The bad guys were goofy and outdated, therefore not too scary.  The interaction between older kids / young teens has value because it shows what happens when choices are made and that choices can be made.",1154217600,,388,4.5
7949794,4,B00005Q2YW,"This is pretty good quality for not being a mainstream Theater release. I don't know the details but I suspect this was a made for TV movie. I initially investigated it because I knew Don Shanks in High School when we played on the football team together. Don plays the part of an Indian spirit here and he coordinates the stunts. He does a great job. You will also see Bo Hopkins and Mickey Rooney. The whole cast does a good job considering this is not a high budget movie.

The movie begins with kids at a school being told about Theodore Roosevelt making Wolf Mountain a park because the wolf spirit spoke to him. When three of the kids are kidnapped by accident when a car is stolen by two bank robbers they go for a wild ride. The kids not only escape from the convicts, but make their lives a living hell to boot with the help of the wolf mountain spirit. Good family fare. If you enjoy some light family entertainment and not just the expensive production movies you will probably enjoy this one.",1140739200,15,1004,4.3689839572192515
