8278301,4,B001AO1ZPO,"Adam Clay (Sam Huntington) is a freshman at college whose goal is to score. His goal becomes Amanda (Kaitlin Doubleday). Amanda belongs to a wicked sorority. Her initiation  task is to find a gay male and break his heart. Adam pretends he is gay to get close to Amanda. Neither knows the truth about each other.

Adam pretending to be gay is the main humor of the film. The film had a number of humorous moments and overall I enjoyed it in spite of none of the characters being real or done particularly well,  other than John Goodman playing a gay bar tender.

A similar film is ""Chicks Dig Gay Guys"" although it is not one I recommend.
