7986854,1,B00008UANT,"I can't find a clear enough picture of the cover to properly quote their false advertising.  They imply or STATE that the brutality committed against psicosis by super crazy CAN BE SEEN on the cover, yet it is censored on the DVD.  That's the only reason I remember buying this DVD, I THINK the Danny Doring match may have been alright, but then again, this is XPW.  Somehow XPW had the ability to make Funk vs Shane Douglas look like Chase Tatum vs Van Hammer, for example...",1312934400,,476,4.448275862068965
7986855,5,B00008UANT,"XPW was a good wrestling company with some major faults. The commentators are arguably the worst in the history of pro wrestling, just anther hardcore company that sprung up like weeds after ECW closed, but for all its faults-it had some great action.

Super Crazy vs Pscosis- I thought it was a good match. Loved the ending of the match. Afterwards Crazy cuts up Pscosis and it edits it out. What the f%$& is that about?

Supreme vs Alterboy Luke: Excellent hardcore match. Supreme was always a highlight in XPW. The most brutual fight ive seen in awhile.

Danny Doring vs Kaos: A good match. Love Doring's finisher; The aftermath sucked for Doring.

Shane Douglas vs Chris Candido: Took awhile for this one to start. Dont care for Douglas, RIP Candido.

Pog VS Sandman: A great feud but this match between the two sucked. Worst on the show.

Juventud Guerrera vs Julio Dinero: I loved Juicy's promo before the match. The match wasn't the best but good.

Mexico's Most Wanted vs Dead Prez: I loved MMW, they are a excellent tag team. Id like to see more of these guys, finisher is awesome.

Overall, a great dvd. There is one commentator and he is a vast improvement over the other two, and if it is the American annoucer from tother XPW dvds I have, what an improvement. Great wrestling dvd.",1208736000,,1293,4.591304347826087
7986856,3,B00008UANT,"Super Crazy vs Psychosis- It's a ok match. Both of them are great luchadors and always put on a good show. It wasn't one of there best matches but because they are both very talented it was ok. Yet at the end Super crazy goes to use a knife on Psychosis and its censored?! Its an XPW hardcore DVD why would it be censored? Grade C

Supreme vs Alterboy Luke- Wow great hardcore match. I was shocked, I assumed it would be a classic squash match, since Luke looked out of his league. Luke hit Supreme with everything he had but the monster took control. Light tubes, tables, and thumbtacks where used, and we saw an amazing finish. Grade B+

Danny Doring vs Kaos- One of the longer, solid wrestling match. It was amazing to see Danny Doring actually winning. Some solid impact moves, and great mat wrestling. GQ Money takes a wicked shot on the guardrail.  Grade C +

Shane Douglas vs Chris Candido- Douglas started out with a great promo. Candido came in and cut an ok promo. Douglas had a cast on which I am sure affected him. Candido was just coming back from an injury and some drug related problems. Both looked very off for a lot of moves. The match went slowly and boring and the fans where not in it at all. Grade D

Extras

Sandman vs Pogo the clown- Solid match, lots of brawling between the monster and the Sandman. It was going so well but they cut it a bit short. The ending was fantastic. Grade C+

Juventud Guerrera vs Julio Dinero- Juicy talks forever before the match. Juicy seems to be on drugs again before his match. Great match! Both of them put on a fantastic show. I dodnt like that Juicy didn't sell some huge moves Dinero hit. Grade B+

Mexico's Most Wanted vs Dead prez- Another solid but not spectacular match. Dead Prez made a good showing for there first match. MMW looked good as always, yet I have seen them do better. Its always great to see there finisher. Grade B

Overall Grade C+ Overall the DVD was about 1 hour and 30 minutes long. It was a shame it was so short, a few of the matches could have used a bit more time. Most matches where solid, but we missed an amazing A match. It only cost $5 so it was like it was a waste of money, yet I have seen them do better.",1177804800,,2201,4.233890214797136

The first match was a rematch between Super Crazy and Psichosis, from Hostile Takeover. The second regular match was a deathmatch title bout between Supreme and Alterboy Luke. Supreme had to take on both Alterboy Luke and Angel, after Angel ran in, and lost the title. This led to the three-way bout between those men in Exit Sandman. The third regular match was between Kaos and Danny Doring. Danny Doring won but it was a non-title match. The fourth regular match was a world title match between Shane Douglas and Chris Candido. The fifth match was a bonus match between Pogo and Sandman. The sixth match was between Juventude Guerrero and Julio Dinero. The last match was an open challenge match from Mexico's Most Wanted and was answered by a new mistery team called Dead Prez.
