7871527,5,6304458835,"This movie is so good, and one of my favorite romantic comedies. It is really ashame that this movie does not have a DVD release. I wanted this movie so bad, I had to purchase it on VHS. It is that good. You can get this movie pretty cheap right now, so I recommend you pick it up before the price starts climbing on this one.",1312502400,,326,3.9545454545454546
7871528,5,6304458835,"This is a movie that I would put in a very special category. It may not be the most well made, or well acted movie. It certainly doesn't have the best script. It isn't the funniest movie I've seen, and it isn't the most romantic. But that doesn't matter. I still loved this movie. Some movies weren't meant to be analyzed, they were just meant to be enjoyed.
Now on to the plot. The story revolves around twin brothers Stephen and Rick Dunne. Both brothers fall for the same girl when they are teenagers. She moves away and ten years pass. In those ten years, Stephen obsesses over her, and Rick gets stood up at the altar. They all meet again at a tacky hotel where Rick is the manager.  Let the games begin!!
Aside from being a very attractive woman, Melissa never gave me any reason why a person should be in love with her for 10 years. She was just sort of there. Allison, on the other hand, is a person I could see a guy fussing about for way more then 10 years. I loved how Ronny had the perfect song for every occasion in the film. And I still get chills every time I watch that last frame of the movie when the two lovers just say ""Hi"" to each other.
I give this movie a 5/5 just for the sheer reason that I have seen it well over 35 times and I still love watching it every time.  That is why this movie get a Doctor's Recommendation.",992908800,6,1343,4.122137404580153
7871529,5,6304458835,"Be forewarned--this Aussie charmer may unexpectedly blindside even the most cynical of viewers...only the clinically dead will fail to fall under its spell. In some ways, this is a gender-switched version of ""Hannah  And Her Sisters"" with its themes of romantic competition between two  brothers; the bickering elder parents (the morbidly hypochondriac Dad gets  to mutter some of the choicest and most hilarious lines under his breath);  the age-old debate of whether destiny plays a part regarding whom you end  up being partnered with, etc. If you enjoy Woody Allen's less cynical  romantic comedies (you know, the Early, Funnier Movies) or recent indie  films like ""Next Stop, Wonderland"", you'll have a good time at  the ""Hotel de Love""!",962928000,2,742,5.228813559322034
7871530,5,6304458835,"I rented this primarily because Saffron Burrows was in it, and she's just so beautiful I frankly didn't even care what genre the movie was -- it could have been action, sci-fi, horror, western, drama, whatever.  It is a  really fun romantic comedy, though, and I found myself laughing out loud on  several occasions.  The seventies music in the soundtrack worked well, and  the subplots were enough to keep you involved.  Think of this as sort of  around the same tone as ""Picture Perfect"", but with more  well-rounded characters...  Really well done, and quite romantic.  I'm  sorry this movie didn't make a bigger splash when it came out, I wish I'd  heard of it sooner.",959990400,3,672,4.747826086956522
7871531,5,6304458835,"This is one the best movies I have seen in a long time. A beautiful movie about love, that really moved me. It's charming, funny and very well written. The acting is terrific. Plus it has a great soundtrack. This is a  film that deserves to be seen. I hope it will find an audience on video. If  you watch this movie in the morning you will be feeling good all day.",923788800,,365,4.055555555555555
