3659077,2,B001JPG85G,"Trying to learn German?  Go with something else.  It did help us remember colors and give us some basic words, but it really goes too quickly to be of much use and the music gets obnoxious quick.  My daughter didn't learn much of anything from this, as she just couldn't keep up- she's four.  Might be better suited for older children in 4-7th grade, but is really cheesy for kids too much older.",1297123200,,396,4.383561643835616
3659078,1,B001JPG85G,"We're trying to teach our toddler German, to which end I've purchased this DVD, the Little Pim Series, and Muzzy, the BBC language course.  I can't stress enough how bad this product is: boring, uninspired, and unedited.  For example, at one point in the DVD we're told we're meeting the boy's family: mother, father, and brother, when clearly he has a sister, not a brother.  The acting is terrible; the children look uncomfortable and behave unnaturally, and the adults just look bored.  The animated dog is a joke and adds nothing to the product.  The Language Tree must have paid someone to do a 3-5 second clip of an animated dog, and then they just re-use the same clip -- overlaid onto the actual video -- over and over.  Of course this means that most of the time the dog's expression doesn't make any sense.  I would be seriously worried about any child who doesn't get bored with this rather quickly.  I can't begin to fathom how anyone could give this a 4 or 5-star review.  All I can think is that they haven't tried the Little Pim Series (highly recommended) or Muzzy.",1295049600,19,1081,4.5595854922279795
3659079,2,B001JPG85G,"I am a native German, but don't speak a lot of it at with my kids.  I was looking for something that is a fun and easy way for my son to learn German, so I liked the concept of this ""fun"" DVD.  He was 7 at the time.  This DVD was very boring to him. The dialogue leaves a bit to be desired and is not very realistic - I don't know many young kids that would be excited to receive a pair of pants as their(apparently only) birthday present from his parents as the boy in the video.  It's been a while since we watched this, but I seem to remember that most of the people on the DVD did not sound like native Germans.  At least one of them was clearly an American with a strong American accent, and another one (I think the grandfather) sounded like he was from Switzerland and hard to understand.  I am just glad I only borrowed this from our library, rather than wasting money on it.",1288915200,6,883,4.017142857142857
3659080,5,B001JPG85G,"It taught my son some basic German. It was strangely funny (i.e., not supposed to be, but that's okay).",1285286400,,103,4.473684210526316
3659081,4,B001JPG85G,This is a cute video that provides a unique story-line for children to relate to.,1264896000,4,81,4.466666666666667
3659082,3,B001JPG85G,"I bought this for my 7 and 2 year old children as a supplement after finishing the German for Children CD series. This video covers all of the same ground (eerily so: does everyone learn their German colors from a balloon seller?). While my children loved the ""home movies"" of Sebastian and his friends at a birthday party, the quiz portion is tedious after you've done it once, and the songs on this dvd are not nearly as catchy as those on the German for Children CD. There's also a lot of cheesy low budget animation. Go with the CDs series.",1262736000,4,544,4.396039603960396
3659083,4,B001JPG85G,"I was looking for a product to get my children started on learning German.  They have had a little instruction in the past, but not enough consistency.  They are 6 and 8 years old.  This DVD captured their attention and my older boy was excited about the interactive games.  They both liked the songs and even tried to sing along.  Overall it was a positive experience and I think they will watch it again on thier own.  On the down side, it is a little short on content and adults won't be overly impressed with some of the child acting...but it's fine for what we wanted.  I have not tried the Muzzy DVDs so I can not compare it to them, but this product is better than many I have seen.",1262563200,2,689,4.213740458015267
3659084,3,B001JPG85G,"My daughter wanted to learn German, so I bought this program for her.  She's nine and loves dogs.  She was bored with the program and thought it was for babies.  She wanted a more rigorous program and basically refused to have anything more to do with this one.  I thought it was okay myself--colorful, cute dog, nice kid, etc.  I think she would have learned quite a bit with it, but she was more interested in grammar than conversation.  (Strange child, I know.)  I would recommend it for another child, especially younger or less sophisticated.",1252886400,2,547,4.6947368421052635
3659085,5,B001JPG85G,"We recently purchased this DVD series for our daughter.  We are going to Germany early next year to visit the grandparents and we wanted her to be start learning German.  This video is excellent and has exceeded our expectations.  Our daughter watches it over and over because she gets a real kick out of the animated dog.  She also likes to show off her knowledge to us while doing the remote control games.  We have been amazed that after only a few times watching the video she aced the true/false and multiple choice interactive games.  We've been having fun practicing phases around the house to get prepared for our trip.  The telling time section in particular we have found very useful. It helps with counting, how to ask someone the time and most importantly understanding what is repeated back.  I would recommend this to anyone, child or adult, who is a beginning German student.",1230854400,23,890,4.733766233766234
8313357,3,B001JPG85G,"Im a native born German, and I bought this DVD to supplement my kids basic German knowledge and improve their spoken German. Not only is the content only appropriate for kids under 6 or 7 (my kids were bored and annoyed within minutes), but the ONE German sentence on the back of the DVD is incorrect. (It says Sprechen sie Deutsche? - which should be Sprechen Sie Deutsch?)  Really? Youre promoting a product to teach a language, spoken by native speakers on the DVD, and you get the ONE German sentence on the packaging wrong? Not impressed.",1525651200,,543,4.597938144329897

8313359,1,B001JPG85G,This DVD sucks. It is not practical or informational. It also did not hold my kids attention. It also is not for beginners.,1457222400,,123,4.391304347826087
8313360,5,B001JPG85G,I bought this DVD for my twin girls.  Theyre in the 3rd grade and we are planning a trip to Germany over the holidays.  I wanted to give them an introduction to the German language.  They have watched it a couple times now and have picked up on key phrases.  Its nice to see them excited about learning and wanting to use their new found basic German skills.  Im confident the more we watch it the more they will pick up and try to use it with one another.  After each lesson they do a review sort of quiz section and my girls are getting competitive with one another to see who can get the correct answer first.  Thumbs up!,1446076800,,624,4.15
8313361,1,B001JPG85G,"Not appropriate for older kids(9) and up. My daughter (7) liked it more due to the music and colors. It would depend how child is learning in general. Also, I thought there were workbooks or sheets but there is not. CD only.",1396828800,,224,4.357142857142857
8313362,2,B001JPG85G,"I was lucky enough to find this DVD at the local library and paid only $1 for the weeks rental. The first sentence on the back of the DVD box reads: "" Sprechen sie Deutsche ? "" The correct way would be: "" Sprechen Sie Deutsch ?"" That said, the context of this DVD is pretty boring. In a Birthday Party setting you will get to know immediate family members, learn how to count to 10, say please, thank you, my name is ....and some colors. The Actors/Speakers are German, which is a plus. I am a native German and my boy understands the language, but refuses to speak it with me. He will repeat after the speakers on CDs (German for Children with Two Audio CDs, Third Edition- LOVE IT!) and also this DVD. My 6 year old loves this DVD of course because he does not get to play Video Games and rarely gets to watch TV.  So anything with a screen is fantastic for him....I would not purchase this DVD set - It's a waste of money. Get the ""German for Children with Two Audio CDs"" instead - my American, non German speaking Husband of 13 Years and our Son are listening to it right now :)",1392854400,,1082,4.152380952380953
8313363,1,B001JPG85G,"Poor sound quality.  We could not understand the speaking, because the German was spoken by natives, at normal speed - and spoken by children to boot.  All of us tend to mumble in our native tongue.  Definitely a lot of mumbled, slurred words and phrases. Not a chance in the world we were going to pick up one word with confidence.",1320537600,,332,4.409836065573771
8313364,5,B001JPG85G,We bought this video so the entire family could try and learn some beginning German.  The kids grandfather speaks German and has been asking for a long time that they learn the language.  We made it a family goal to get started and found this video to be perfect for our needs.  The phrases are easy to remember because they are reviewed often in a number of different ways.  It's much better than other tools we have tried because the actors speak at a normal cadence.  It feels very realistic and the vocabulary and phrases are ones that can be used daily so we've worked on incorporating them into our family conversations.  It's a great start for us and I would definitely recommend the video.,1314835200,,697,4.536
8313365,5,B001JPG85G,"We have rented this from our library several times and our 3 yo son has fallen in love with the dog and music...I speak some German with him and my wife covers spanish. This video is likely best for younger kids 2-5 yo. Our son just cannot get enough of it - in the end the in person speaking (parents, teachers, travel, etc.) cannot replace anything else.",1310342400,,356,4.3283582089552235
8313366,1,B001JPG85G,"I get that this is suppose to be following a little boy and such, but I found it extremely boring and not at all fun!  The German was spoken super fast and there really wasn't much explanation as it was playing. The video would move on with no repeating and at the end quiz you.  There are better programs out there. We live in Germany and I was just looking for something that I could add to my home school curriculum for my DD to making learning German fun.  This was not it!  Look else where and don't waste your money.",1302998400,2,522,4.138613861386139
