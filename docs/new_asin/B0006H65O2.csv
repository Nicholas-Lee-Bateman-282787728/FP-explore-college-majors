If you really want a good dvd then pick up (whitetail strtagies) the ultimate guide
By Peter Fiduccia",1372118400,,176,4.205882352941177
8323507,5,B0006H65O2,"I watched the DVD and then ordered a copy for my dad and another hunter that has success with calling. This video teaches how, when, and how loud to use snort, grunt, blat, and bleat calls. He gives 3-4 variations of each type of call. There are some good hunts on the DVD and Peter also uses rattling on one of the hunts. Great DVD. He teaches how to make some of the calls with just your mouth instead of a call. I got the tip to look for Peter Fiduccia's information inside Hal Blood's ""Hunting Big Woods Bucks"" two books.",1296000000,,525,4.207920792079208
