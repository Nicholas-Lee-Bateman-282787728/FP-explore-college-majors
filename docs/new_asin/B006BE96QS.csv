8496036,5,B006BE96QS,"Wow!! This 2 disc set is really more that I expected!  The pack arrived several days before the posted delivery date, was very well packaged, and the disc quality is excellent!  Now to the meat!!!  Nadine's teaching skills are superb; her tips and tricks are worth it all.  My wife and I watched both DVD's almost back to back, and decided that we will have to attend one of Nadine's live workshops!  She audibly repeats the steps as she is demonstrating, and that only reinforces what techniques you need to learn.  We both have taken pine needle coiling classes on several different occasions from excellent instructors, but I have to say that Nadine Spier's techniques and teaching have inspired more creative juices to flow than anybody else has been able to achieve in this field.  I have to say that I will be using these DVD's as reference material very frequently!  Whether  you are a gourder or basket weaver, this is a remarkable set of learning tools!!!",1437350400,4,964,4.724550898203593

8496041,5,B006BE96QS,I have just started adding pine needle embellishments to my fine art gourd and wood bowl work - I have books from other sources however these DVDs are a new level of information.  I feel as if I am in a one-on-one class with Nadine.  I have already experienced marked improvement in my weaving and may now take on a full basket project.  I am very happy I made this purchase.,1391385600,2,375,4.253521126760563
