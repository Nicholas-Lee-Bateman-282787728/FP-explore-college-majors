6991943,5,B00SSJIBZ6,"I'd never heard of Katatonia until a couple months ago. Heard some of the songs on this blu-ray on a Kscope podcast & was intrigued. Mentioned to my husband, and after we checked out some of the performances on youtube, he bought the blu-ray. We're in love with the acoustic versions of Katatonia's melancholy and soulful songs! You don't have to be into Katatonia or death metal as a genre to appreciate this. (We are fans of Steven Wilson, Porcupine Tree, Pineapple Thief, Gazpacho, and Opeth.) The Union Chapel, where this blu-ray was filmed, definitely adds to the ambiance. We're sufficiently attracted to the whole ""vibe"" of Jonas & Anders that we'll probably purchase some of Katatonia's CDs. My partner (a music snob) says Bruce Soord did a great job on the surround mix. This blu-ray is in heavy rotation at our house...",1430956800,9,829,4.804195804195804

6991945,5,B00SSJIBZ6,If you love Katatonia this is a must have! The live acoustic concert is amazing and shows that Katatonia is great in any medium!,1430611200,,128,4.375
6991946,5,B00SSJIBZ6,Excellent... Concert!!! Thumbs up.. Highly recommended,1430265600,2,54,8.166666666666666
6991947,5,B00SSJIBZ6,A truly superior audio and video experience! Incorrectly described as 1.33 to 1 video ( it is 16 x 9). The audio is STUNNING 5.1 DTS HD Master and totally immersive surround mix. The concert is unplugged Katatonia. The harmonies of  Jonas and Bruce Soord are really in fantastic form. Katatonia fans will be pleased to see some material never performed live. Also worth mentioning is the incredible candle-lit atmosphere of Union Chapel. One of the finest audio recordings I have heard and the high sampling rate tracked by my Oppo Blu-ray Player bears this out. Highly recommended.,1429574400,7,582,4.938775510204081

8699128,2,B00SSJIBZ6,Beware acoustic only..not a rock prog concert...,1473984000,,48,6.0
8699129,5,B00SSJIBZ6,Picked this up on a whim. Mind=blown.  5.1 Sound mix/quality is immense. Musicianship is top notch. Recommendation: Buy this immediately.,1457740800,,137,5.85
8699130,4,B00SSJIBZ6,"I love Katatonia. With that said, I'm once again disappointed in a Blu-Ray that I have purchased and experienced less than stellar video quality (The first was Adele at Royal Albert Hall). Whoever did their videography just didn't shoot for a quality product. And the sound isn't as clear as I'd like. This could have easily been a regular DVD and I wouldn't have noticed.",1457740800,,372,4.7384615384615385
8699131,5,B00SSJIBZ6,"Simply amazing sound. Music, vocals, and venue make this a concert worth listening to over and over again.",1450742400,,106,4.944444444444445

8699134,5,B00SSJIBZ6,"amazing concert. Katatonia showing live their acoustic side. Much more interesting than Deathroned and Uncrowned.
The blu ray includes a card to download the MP so you do not need to also buy the 2CD+DVD version",1433808000,2,211,4.888888888888889
8699135,4,B00SSJIBZ6,"The music and setting are excellent , audio on the disc is acceptable but the video is very noisy and it is the reason I can't give this otherwise must have disc a 5 star rating.",1432771200,4,178,3.9722222222222223
8699136,5,B00SSJIBZ6,Sound is off from picture slightly still worth buying. I don't know much about Katatonia. I got my first look from kscope app. Seen the video and after that I knew I needed it.,1432512000,2,176,4.205882352941177
