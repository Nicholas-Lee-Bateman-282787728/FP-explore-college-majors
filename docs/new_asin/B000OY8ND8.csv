2802486,5,B000OY8ND8,"I have 2 sons, 2 yrs. 4 months, and a nine month old. The very first time the 2 yr. old saw this DVD, the moment it ended he asked to potty. Then he did it again later! He immediately started singing the theme song, and asked for this video again and again. Scary how easily a kid can be indoctrinated by someone other than the parent! We have been trying to get the kid to use the toilet, but he was not crazy about the idea until we bought this DVD. I also bought the recommended ""Potty Adventure"" - my son did not respond that well to that one for many reasons (which I will explain in my review of that product). There are several reasons I think this works well: (1) catchy songs. The DVD has the film and then the ""music videos"" which my kid is into also. I can see him trying to memorize the songs as he's watching the cartoon. As I said, he sings the refrain from theme song! (2) They let kids know that there are different kinds of potty chairs. We use the seat that goes on the toilet, and they explain that that's a potty chair too. So it doesn't matter what kind you use in your house - the seat or the potty chair - your kid will be included. (3) They show the toddler that everyone goes potty (not just your parents who are pressuring you to join them in the toilet-going thing). I think it registers that your favorite animals (pandas, ducks, elephants, bears...) all have to potty somewhere. (4) They let the kid know that it's a feeling in the tummy that lets you know you have to go potty. I think that's smart and helpful, and I haven't seen other books and films say this. ...We've seen ""Go Potty Go"" twice already this morning, and my child is asking for it again. My 9 month old watches it too. He likes the music, and maybe he likes to see the babies (in the sequence that says, basically, ""babies poop and pee too, but in their diapers, and that's okay, but I want to be a big kid, and go potty""...). I can't recommend this one enough.

Update: The boys are now nearly 4.5 and 3 - and the just-shy-of-3 year old has started asking to see this DVD. He argues with his older brother about whether or not he's a baby or a big kid, and big brother says he's not because ""big kids go potty."" I think that this DVD is about to work his magic once more. If you ask me, this was money well spent.",1205539200,65,2312,4.115044247787611
2802487,5,B000OY8ND8,"My husband and I are new parents and we needed a little help in the potty training area. I purchased this video and my son likes it very much. He is very entertained by the animation and I can see that the story is holding his attention. He answers the intereactive questions when asked. It is yet to be seen if this will help ""get things moving""... I would recommend this video.",1202515200,2,379,4.277777777777778
2802488,5,B000OY8ND8,My daughter is 2 and a half and loves the Go Potty Go DVD.  It is cute and has a fun catchy song and I think it explains the potty process really well for a two year old to understand. The other day we put it in and within 5 minutes she was on her potty going.  We are about 3 weeks into potty traing so she gets it and it wasn't all from the DVD but it does help review the potty process for her.,1197936000,9,397,3.604651162790698
2802489,4,B000OY8ND8,"This DVD is a step by step introduction to potty training for a young toddler. My 2 year old loved it, and she is now way more into the notion of potty training. She asks for it over and over now. The music is defiantly more for her than for me as it is quite obnoxious, but if it works I can bare it.",1182816000,9,301,3.71875

2802514,2,B000OY8ND8,"I'm giving this DVD 2 stars because my daughter loves it, but it hasn't actually helped us with potty training at all. We borrowed a copy from the library, but it only played a couple of songs because the disc was super scratched. Since then (over 4 months ago) my daughter has asked me for Go Potty Go almost once a week. I finally bought it for her so she could see the whole thing all the way through even though I had my doubts.

She's 3 and had some regressions even though she is potty trained. So this DVD doesn't really apply to her since it is really an introductory video for potty training. But this such a short video and with animated characters, I know my daughter and I know this would not have helped her at all when she was first learning. The only good thing are the catchy songs, which we can sing with her when she needs to go. Kids need to see REAL kids on the potty and need more instruction than this. Maybe this would be good along with other potty movies and books for a really young toddler just to gain their interest in potty training?

It's really hard to navigate the menu too. You can select the entire program or just the songs, but when you try to click on one or the other both buttons change colors so you don't know which one you are selecting.

If you can, check this out from the library before buying your own.",1424217600,,1349,4.2007722007722

2802532,5,B000OY8ND8,My toddlers loved this DVD and wanted to watch it again and again. It really helped them excel in the concept of using the potty and knowing what the potty is and what isn't. They seemed to be able to connect with it a lot more than any other Potty DVD I have shown to them.,1393113600,,274,3.9107142857142856

2802535,5,B000OY8ND8,"I first purchased this DVD back in 2009 when I began potty training my daughter.  She loved it so much that we (notice I said WE) had to watch it over and over.  She loved to sing along with the little Panda characters.  She loved sitting on the potty while she watched the show.  She would keep singing ""go potty, go potty, go potty, go""  LOL.  When I started training my 3 year old son to use the potty, I broke out the old Go Potty Go DVD.  He was just as enthralled with it as his sister was.  As a matter of fact she, at age 5, would sit and watch it with her brother and sing along.  So cute!  LOL  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who has little ones to potty train.  It encourages children to use the potty, while making the process fun!",1389657600,,756,4.0

2802537,3,B000OY8ND8,My daughter didn't really care for it.  My son however loved it so I guess it just depends on the kids.,1386547200,,103,3.9047619047619047
2802538,2,B000OY8ND8,"The front of the box calls this ""Potty Training for Tiny Toddlers."" However, it's more geared towards older toddler/preschoolers who need to be guilted into potty training. During the ""Diapers are for Babies"" song, all of the kids shown as examples of 'big kids' are MUCH older, and many of the 'babies' are more than old enough to be potty trained. When my almost-2-year old sees kids HER AGE wearing diapers while the song sings that diapers are for babies, it doens't exactly have the intended effect of making her feel too old for diapers! Also, the front of the video claims ""for boys and girls."" While there are both male and female pandas, the cartoon human shown throughout the video is a girl. There are defnitely more girls than boys in the video.

My daughter does love that the video is mostly songs. She loves music. It makes her want to dance... but it doesn't make her want to go potty like the Elmo video does. The 20 minutes is short and makes it feel like a waste of money. Even my tiny toddler wants to watch it more than once in a row because she feels like it ended too soon.",1383004800,,1096,4.399014778325123

2802562,5,B000OY8ND8,"After finally getting this DVD in the mail my daughter watched it about 4 times. 2 weeks later she was on the big girl potty doing her thang, she was never interested in the big girl potty before watching this. i would recommend this to everybody",1370995200,,246,4.369565217391305
2802563,5,B000OY8ND8,"This dvd and The Magic Bowl dvd purchased together, given to my Grandson. He loved them and watched them repeatedly for a couple weeks prior to begin potty training. Wow he had the idea down pat which made training much easier.
Little ones are ready when they keep their diaper drier & drier upon waking. By that time they know how to hold it. Put them on their child size seat as soon as they wake up. Then every 1/2 hr apart all day. Some break faster than others but around 2 weeks or so of consistency and total patience will do it . Also we put up a large piece of colored construction paper on the bottom of the fridge door with the child's name on top saying:
N a m e's Potty Chart, divide into 2/3 and 1/3 spaces, on the side of the 2/3 (top) space write Peepee, & on side of 1/3 space write Poopoo, then everytime your child is sucsessful let them pick a sticker out from sheets of their favorite characters or dolls or cars etc. Make a huge praising fuss and rush them to pick out which sticker they want to put on their chart within the proper area but don't pick the spot let them put it where they choose. Then everytime someone comes over praise your childs accomplishments in front of them and they will love,love the attention and praise and want to continue to make you proud. When they have accidents softly tell them it's ok, its an accident just keep trying to only go in the potty. Happy ""No more diaper days!"" it's worth the patience & time you put in and you'll be proud of how you handled potty breaking your little one. Good Luck Mommie & Daddy ;D",1370217600,,1572,4.225913621262459
2802564,4,B000OY8ND8,"My son enjoyed the catchy songs. Like with all potty training vices, it's a little vague on some steps of the process. But my son was more motivated after watching it a couples of days to start using the potty. I think it was a good buy.",1369526400,,237,4.0638297872340425
2802565,1,B000OY8ND8,I watched this video with my two year old and I thought it included way too much for a young child to grasp about using the potty.  I returned shortly after watching it.,1366848000,,169,4.121212121212121

2802567,5,B000OY8ND8,"We had read the books with her. We had used the sticker charts. We'd even been reduced to rewarding with candy. It was getting to be desperate times as we neared montessori school where potty training was required. So I bought this DVD with the Bear and the Big Blue House potty training DVD and I have to say, having the two movies interchanging constantly for a few days sealed the deal on potty training. And the best part is she immediately became accident free. I recommend using the DVD to help your little one along...",1361145600,2,525,4.479166666666667

2802582,3,B000OY8ND8,"Purchased this to assist my son and daughter-inlaw with potty training my 2 1/2 year old grandson.  Prior to watching he would use the ""big"" potty for his pee-pee.  Nothing could convince him however to do a #2 on either a portable potty chair, or the big potty using a ring.  I will say, I think he now recognizes the feeling of ""when"" he has to go.  Just don't think the message in here was enough for him to grasp the entire ""big potty""  thing is for me.  He is a very smart, accomlished toddler and know it's not that he doesn't understand.  I think with this movie, your child will either love it, or think it is so-so.  My grandson certainly isn't selecting that video, as the one he wants to watch as he is winding down for the day.",1349654400,2,739,4.191489361702128

Average once a day. I began to play this video for them 1 1/2 weeks ago and they love it.  It has catchy, danceable tunes and the words are easy to remember.  Go Potty, Go Potty, Go Potty go is one of their favorites.  Since we began playing it, they have had less accidents.  I would recommend to older toddlers although my infants are enjoying it also.  They dance when the songs come on and were enthralled the first few times I put the video on.  Overall, a good purchase for my daycare.",1346025600,,663,4.368852459016393
2802584,5,B000OY8ND8,"The reviews of this DVD are accurate- there isn't much detail as far as each specific step in using the potty, but for my 3 year old who was already potty training it served as a motivator to finally get her focussed on using the potty all the time and wearing big kid underwear. Our hang up had been that she just didn't care about accidents and wasn't motivated by sticker charts or big kid underwear. She was immediately hooked on this video and asked to watch it repeatedly. After several viewings in the last few days she now calls herself a big girl and has significantly fewer accidents (a couple of accident-free days). I do find the language and tone of it to be heavy handed propaganda but I was at my wits end potty training and seeing the improvement is helping me look past that!",1329523200,,792,4.394557823129252

There are kids swinging on swings, babies in cribs, a COUPLE of short scenes of cartoons using the potty, but that's it. The songs are ok for little ones, but that's not why I bought it. I bought it in the hopes that it would help me (even a little) in the potty-training process, and it definitely didn't do that. Toddlers need more imagery I think- how are they supposed to understand about using the potty if you're singing about it, but showing images of kids playing on a playground? What does that have anything to do with toilet training, I ask you?  ARRGG!  Very frustrating. Oh well, lesson learned, I guess.

2802616,1,B000OY8ND8,"This DVD is a fiasco.  Crappy animation and annoying songs...I can put up with.  But this product has terrible educational content.

PT is about teaching a child a few key concepts:  1) listen to your body (and basic bathroom anatomy), 2) when you get ""the feeling"", use the potty, 3) basic hygiene (wipe, flush and wash hands), 4) accidents are ok, 5) you are a good kid and we are proud of you...no matter what.  This dvd has animals and vague references to potty use, but no clear organized focus on the potty themes and way too obtuse for a toddler!  Plus, the derogatory and mean-spirited theme song about diapers being for babies is NOT helpful...confusing for the beginning of potty training, when the kid is still in diapers and not really ready for underwear, and also for the reluctant trainee, who is conflicted about giving up babyhood.

Basically, this seems to have been designed by someone who has never potty trained a kid.  A complete mess.  Buy Elmo's Potty Time instead.",1277337600,3,989,4.703488372093023

NOT ONCE does the video illustrate pulling underwear or pants up or down, or what happens on the potty or goes in the potty.

My 23-month-old has learned her letters, numbers, and colors already from videos, so I thought a video would be the best introduction to potty training.  Definitely not this one!

- things big kids do (climb trees, ride bikes, etc)
- where different animals go potty
- the ""big kid parade"" (what?)
- what's *not* a potty (""is this a potty?"" game)
- washing hands (after using the potty)
- wiping
- actually using the potty

My son seems to really enjoy the video - he asks to watch it over and over again.  But he expresses no interest in using his potty while watching it, or after.  The video spends way, way, way too much time trying to convince little kids that they really want to be big kids.  It's like a big kid propaganda movie.  And, even so, it barely makes the connection between being a big kid and using a potty.  By the time my son is old enough to fall prey to the manipulation they're trying to use in this video, he'll already have learned how to use a potty.  Oh, and the songs are pretty dumb and the narrator sounds like a Stepford Wife.

We had borrowed an old copy of ""Once Upon A Potty"" from a friend, and while it seemed a little weird, our son *immediately* asked to sit on his potty.  That video is filled with kids sitting on the potty, and actually shows a cartoon kid trying to use it, and succeeding.  And when they sing the (admittedly goofy) ""Potty Song,"" the video again shows kids actually sitting on the potty -- unlike in ""Go Potty Go,"" in which cartoon animals sing the song while showing off underwear.

The main point of any decent potty video should be to get a kid, who is perfectly content to pee and poop in his diaper, to want to use a potty, instead.  This video fails, miserably.

DO NOT BUY THIS.",1255132800,40,1750,4.213213213213213
2802632,5,B000OY8ND8,As parents we are always looking for the right tools to aid in the proper upbringing of our kids. This movie was a terrific help with the process of potty training our son. As he watched the movie it help he be atease and to give it a try. Take our word for it and give this movie a try.,1254873600,,287,3.8
2802633,5,B000OY8ND8,My daughter loves this DVD.  After she watches it she will always want to go sit on her potty.  She is 21 months and I haven't gotten serious with the whole potty training yet but I am sure that this will be a big help in getting her warmed up.  I also like the fact that it is kind of short.  I don't like her just sitting in front of the TV so that is a very attractive feature about this DVD.,1254787200,,395,3.7804878048780486
2802634,5,B000OY8ND8,This is such a great video. I wrote a review on this dvd under the Potty Power dvd review. Both of the videos are made by the same people. Excellent!!!,1253232000,,151,4.066666666666666
2802635,5,B000OY8ND8,"We had a great experience with this dvd.  We had been working on potty training with about a 40% success rate for peeing and 0% for pooing.  After watching this video - literally only watched about 5 times - he was excited to be a big boy, wear big kid underpants, and pee in the potty!!  Like most books/videos we have looked through there is very little mention of pooing.  So this took us a little longer.  The only other result of this video is my sons desire to pee/poo in private.  We can only assume that because the video shows animals peeing behind objects that he has decided he must be alone in the potty.

Would recommend this dvd to everyone!!",1250467200,,656,4.327868852459017
2802636,4,B000OY8ND8,"My son, 3, enjoyed this video and is still singing ""Go Potty Go!"" however his intentions to actually GO to the potty have not changed. The video really keeps his attention and he enjoys it but he does not yet understand what they're talking about for the most part, he just mimics the songs. The video is very short but captivating. Helpful? Not in my case, not yet anyway. Maybe in a couple of months, until then I will keep this is his circulation of educational programs.",1250208000,,474,4.459770114942529

Honestly, what was the writer thinking? The target age for potty training is usually between 2 and 3 years, but yet they talk about big kids climbing trees, and riding bikes. Activities that NO toddler would be able to do anyway. This DVD does seem to have gotten fairly good reviews so I will reserve my final judgement AFTER my grandchild has had it for awhile.",1245024000,,504,4.489130434782608

He vastly prefers the GPG video and watches it multiple times per day.  He is fascinated by the Pandas.  My newphew generally ignores movies and doesn't care for television, but he can't get enough of GPG and he sings along.  He isn't potty-trained yet, but is beginning to show more interest.  This video is very catchy, has great kid-friendly songs, and solid content but you might want to pick up ear plugs if your child decides that he or she likes it.",1234137600,5,591,4.485981308411215
2802651,2,B000OY8ND8,"I have a 22 month old. This video is useless.  They discuss where ducks and lambs go potty, then they spend 5 minutes talking about Page and Parker Panda picking out their favorate pair of underwear so they can march in the big kid parade.  I think children learn from watching other children using the potty and this is all about cartoon animals.  Then they have the panda testing the kids and he's asking ""is this a potty chair? No its a wagon! Is this a potty chair?  No its a beach pale!"" I mean,can this be any more ridiculous? and the voice is so condescending, which would be ok if they actually taught children something. Don't waste your money.  I have heard that Potty Power shows real children and I am going to try that video.",1232755200,4,738,4.357664233576642

HE LOVES, LOVES, LOVES IT!  He remembered the songs quickly and within a couple of days of watching it he started wanting to pee pee in the potty like the Potty Pandas!

They both love the songs (I even find myself singing them around the house) and they ask to watch it again and again.  I'm not positive how much influence it's had in our potty training (we've only been at it for a few weeks) but it's definately entertaining and sends an excellent message.",1226448000,,402,4.141025641025641

2802658,5,B000OY8ND8,"I got this DVD for my 2.5 yr old who had started to show some interest in potty training.  I think that is key--The songs are catchy and fun but alone of course they won't motivate a kid to just go.  There has to be more going on than just a video! However she sings ""Go Potty Go"" as she runs to the bathroom.  We've got the pee down and are working on poos now. We also give a small gift for each time she makes it.  It's exciting and an adventure this way. I really like how it talks about how everyone goes potty, and explains about growing up, and that it's okay for babies to wear diapers but ""I'd rather be a big kid doing things the big kid way"" the animation is simple but I think that is a help and not a hindrance.  It's a cute DVD and I recommend it.",1224374400,,761,3.8838709677419354

The video contains 4 catchy songs interspersed with cartoon characters talking about being a big kid and going to the potty.  My toddler can't get enough of it, sings the songs all the time, and has definitely started using the potty more regularly since we got the video!

I understand that these videos aren't a magic bullet, and that at 2 Penny is just starting out with the most minimal interest, and I'm not going to try to pressure her so much as encourage her when she's really ready.

My daughter loved the video and sings the song like crazy. My daughter has since started potty training with very few accidents. This DVD is wonderful and would reccommend to to everyone and anyone. It is great. It Teaches them more than to just go potty. My daughter no longer calls herself a baby. She is a big girl and is potty trainin (her words).",1215648000,,472,4.375
2802685,5,B000OY8ND8,"Pros: My boy/girl twins are being pottytrained, and this DVD is one of their favorite parts (M&Ms coming in at #1, this at a close second). They are 26 months old, and like the music and the cartoon characters in the DVD. My daughter asks to watch it every day, and she dances to the ""Go Potty Go"" theme song. My son sings the ""babies wear diapers and that's okay, but I'd rather be a big kid, and do things the big kid way."" Sometimes they sit on their potty chairs together and sing the theme song, which is pretty cute.

Cons: It's fairly short, about 20 minutes, so they always want to watch it twice. I also don't like the visuals on the ""Big Kid"" song: they show ""baby shoes"" which are toddler Stride Rite sandals my daughter wears, and being a ""big kid"" is about climbing trees and swinging by yourself (both which my toddlers can of course not do). But they are too young to notice the discrepancies, and dance through the whole thing anyway.",1214524800,3,950,4.337078651685394
