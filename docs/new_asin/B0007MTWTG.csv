8048958,2,B0007MTWTG,Terrible.  Dont waste your money. No details. Better choices out there like NISHIUCHI'S TRADITIONAL OKINAWAN KOBUDO WEAPONRY DVD SERIES. Im not sure what to do with this one. I would give it away for free if someone wanted it.,1480896000,,226,4.794871794871795
8048959,2,B0007MTWTG,Went to a simenar that was hosted at my school. Praticipated in a hour and a half class on sai. My school teaches weopons but no sai. I was hooked and wanted to learn a form and more on the side. So i picked up this dvd. This dvd is terrible. I don't understand all the good reviews. Do yourself a favor and buy Nishiuchi's Traditional Okinawan Kobudo Weaponry DVD Series. Its for sale on amazon you and century. Century has a better discription on volume content. Unless you want to here with a sai over and over again and don't want details then buy this one. You can literally have this dvd. I don't want it might as well throw it in the trash.,1480636800,,647,4.184
8048960,5,B0007MTWTG,"Great to learn from a master, good DVD, still could be less in price.",1476403200,,69,4.0
8048961,5,B0007MTWTG,"Sensei Demura clearly and expertly guides you through the basics of the sai. Even those familiar with this weapon can benefit from this excellent video from a true master. If you follow the examples he gives here, you will have a rock-solid foundation to build upon and learn almost any more advanced material. Highly recommended!",1469750400,,330,5.0181818181818185
8048962,5,B0007MTWTG,"Just like all of his other DVDs he teaches the basics and the history if this weapon, he shows you the advanced moves as well as the basic movements this is a good buy for the martial artist.",1421107200,,191,4.052631578947368
8048963,4,B0007MTWTG,"This is generally a good book, but I find that a fair amount of Demura's instruction to be ""adequate"" and informative, but not very exciting to read.",1365897600,,149,4.555555555555555
8048964,5,B0007MTWTG,"Fumio Demura is the best. i have all his dvds and books on weapons and shito ryu karate. im currently studying his nunchaku dvds and book and they're amazing. i only wish he had more weapon dvds/books.
i highly recommend this and any of Fumio Demura's books/dvds to anyone serious about weapons/karate.",1281571200,,302,4.826923076923077
8048965,5,B0007MTWTG,"I participated in a series of kobudo seminars in which Fumio Demura taught his Kobudo Kihon Kata. Readers will need a little context to understand what is going on here.

Master Demura decided that kobudo was not being taught intelligently, with too much emphasis on learning just one weapon and only two or three kata for the black belt. He also thought the Okinawan kobudo kata were too long for the common purposes of testing and competition. He said he can judge your performance in the first five seconds, so why wait three minutes for a 200-step kata to finish?

For these reasons he created six ""Kihon Kata"" for kobudo. They are beginner kata, exactly like the Heians (Pinans). The six kata cover the basic moves of bo, tonfa, nunchaku, sai, kama and ekubo. Each kata is about 20 moves long. Short and sweet. Perfect for beginners; perfect for contests and testing.

Add these katas to your Shotokan curriculum, one per kyu rank parallel to the Heians. Your students will be greatly enriched.

It is a pity that Demura marketed the Kihon Kata as six separate videos. Their special utility cannot be appreciated until you see the entire curriculum. The set of six kata is a milestone in kobudo teaching, but presented one-by-one the kata naturally disappoint kobudo experts. This is a set for beginners, and for people who teach beginners. In that light, these six kata are absolutely outstanding.",1240963200,4,1403,4.833333333333333
