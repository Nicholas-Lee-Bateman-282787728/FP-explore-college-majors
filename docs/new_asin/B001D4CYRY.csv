8291641,2,B001D4CYRY,"While it does provide good practical self defense techniques there are only a handful of them in the DVD and it is very long and drawn out in the explanation, it was not what I was looking for but it did provide a nice look into how the Marines train in LINE, and provides a good idea of how one should fight in a street fight.",1428192000,,327,3.9696969696969697
8291642,4,B001D4CYRY,"you can find the full video with this link http://youtu.be/geSaeg_1Tcs

give some boot camp basics that may serve you well in some situations, but as I stated this is a very basic video",1383868800,2,185,4.606060606060606
8291643,4,B001D4CYRY,"Definetely a good video to learn with. Slow paced with plenty of examples before moving on. However, definetely be careful when praticing with a buddy because some of these moves can do damage.",1372636800,3,193,4.878787878787879

8291645,3,B001D4CYRY,"The video explains well the techniques, although covering mostly wrist locks, sweeps and blocking techniques.
Very easy to understand and apply ,just thought I would learn more with more content but the dvd is only 60 mins.",1348790400,,223,5.054054054054054
8291646,4,B001D4CYRY,This is an hour long training film of actual Marine Corp recruits training in L.I.N.E. hand to hand defense. It covers defense against strikes and chokes.,1348531200,,154,4.961538461538462
8291647,5,B001D4CYRY,"We received this training in our Platoon at MCRD San Diego in 1999.  Today, I still remember these techniques and highly recommend this training to anyone who wants to improve their self defense skills.  Warning though, be wise and use it with extreme caution when training and to CYA, warn your opponent in a real life situation because, you WILL, cause permanent long term damage if utilized properly and there is a strong possibility that it can cause fatal results.",1339286400,10,469,4.85
8291648,5,B001D4CYRY,"L.I.N.E. Training as covered in this excellent and fun-to-watch dvd is easy to learn, stays with you and is effective in street situations. ""Neurological override"" refers to the automatic response you will develop from repetition of these simple moves. You do not have to think about what to do next. With some actual practice (get a buddy you trust) you will translate these easy step-by-step moves from the film to real life. The program is perfect for women, young people, parents who want their kids to know how to handle themselves and for regular guys who want the same. It is well worth the money. The trick to this dvd is to make it fun. Watch it over and over until you know what's coming up next. Have the kids do the same. It is very effective stuff. The United States Marine Corps teaches it to every recruit. That should tell you all you need to know.",1311984000,4,864,4.509554140127388
