8285289,5,B001BY7PGG,"As an Independent film maker myself.  I have to say I really enjoyed this movie.  It was well written and surprisingly from a neighboring native.  Kudos to you Harold Jackson for writing such a drama driven story.  In reviewing the credits I can see how trying to put this film together was not easy for you since you wore many hats to achieve your goal.  It's what I do for my productions.  My ONLY negative comment about the film is that in some scenes I had to turn up the volume to hear dialogue.  Also, some scenes were extremely dark but that didn't take away from the overall content of the film.  I wish you continued SUCCESS.  I recommend this film for everyone to see and I ask that you support us Independent Film Makers.
