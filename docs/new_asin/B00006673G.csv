One day he is trying to save a boy that is about to be hit by a car, he is killed instead. He is approached by a pretty girl flying on a broom. Her name is Botan, and she's the Grimm Reaper. She offers him a chance to regain his life. After coming back to life Yusuke becomes a Spirit Detective. He gain spiritual powers and hunts down rogue apparitions that cause trouble for the living world. He is joined by his friend Kuwabara, the demons Hiei and Kurama. Together they fight off the deadly demons that seek to destroy the world.

After storming Maze Castle Yusuke, Kuwabara, Hiei and Kurama encounter the 4 beasts. Kuwabara and Hiei must battle Byakko the white tiger, and Seiryu the blue dragon.

This is  a great series. It has lots of cool characters, good animation, voice acting, and a very engrossing story. It's a very long anime, so if you want to watch it be prepared to like it and spend a long time with it. It's one of those that gets more interesting as it progresses. Even though it has a bang up start it maintains the flow throughout. I would even go so far as to say that it's one of the most famous anime series' of all time. It has a bit of a Dragonball Z vibe to it, and everyone likes that. I highly recommend Yu Yu Hakusho to every anime fan, it's simply amazing.",1353110400,,1394,4.2727272727272725
7961692,5,B00006673G,"For those who know the series up til thus far, I'll cut to the chase in traditional Yusuke fashion.
After infiltrating Maze Castle, Urameshi and company come face to face with the castle's inhabitants: Zombies and four Saint Beasts from the same chinese mythologies that spawned Fushigi Yugi for those who watch/read it. In the last volume, Kurama showed his ruthlessness by killing the stone turtle, Genbu. This volume takes our heroes to the inner parts of the castle. There they find the white tiger Byakku, who fights our favorite brick, Kasuma Kuwabara. Kuwabara whips out his spirit sword and let's just say no one gets to beat Kuwabara senseless but Yusuke. Hiei then has to battle Seiryu, the cold dragon. from there they have to face the only Saint Beast left, Suzaku the phoenix.
The action is happening walst(and at the same time as) Keiko and Botan in the human world are being hunted by the bug zombies.
Like every episode of Yu Yu Hakusho, it's all good. The stark opposite of Dragon Ball's style, Hakusho cuts out useless dialogue to get it on immediatly. What continues to attract viewers to the show is that rather than the supernatural powers be the great equalizer, Yusuke in particualr relies on a moron thing called THINKING.
On the technical side, this FUNimation DVD contains both the English language and original Japanese products. The DVD contains two subtitle tracks, one word for word English ADR Dub and one track of the literal Japanese translation of the dialogue. The latter track is invaluable to keep happy those fans who are opposed to dubbing and those who want to know what the original dialogue was because they don't speak Japanese.
This is a must for any Hakusho fan because Yusuke is still the only anime character who could, in that unlikely event, quote his american counterpart in context with, ""We came, we saw, we kicked its a**!""",1055980800,,1876,4.811145510835913
7961693,5,B00006673G,"Yu Yu Hakusho is a great anime series, and though the animation in the movie is kind of ...different, the movie was fabulous. It had a plot that was easy enough to follow along with, and yet it was still exciting. Go for it.",1051056000,,224,4.113636363636363
7961694,5,B00006673G,"After Yuskue learns that compassion can be just as powerful as brute force in battle (see last episode of last volume), he is forced into a bit of a disadvantage.  Moments after team Urameshi's last battle against the Dr. Ichigaki team, the tournament committee rules that the third round will begin immediately.  This obviously hurts Yuskue and friends' chances of success, but face it, what demon (or human crimelord) wants him to win?
With Kuwabara too badly injured to fight, and Hiei and the Masked Fighter trapped because of some shady dealings, only Yusuke and Kurama are left to take on team Masho.  How can you win when it's five against two?  Watch this volume to find out.",1049241600,2,683,4.762711864406779
7961695,2,B00006673G,"I love Anime, and love YYH even more, but The First Movie, dubbed is a BAD representitive. What's wrong with their original names!  You want it dubbed, that's fine, but excuse me, Eugene?  Vincente!  DENNIS!  WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO MY SILVER/RUBY-TRESSED KITSUNE-CHAN (THAT KARASU JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO KEEP HIS ITCHING HANDS OFF OF)!  I personally have no problem with the names, but come on, be real...DENNIS just DOESN'T replace the nice ring 'Kurama' (have to do with stealth...suits him doncha think?) adds to the show. Thank heavens that I had my Relena Peacecraft doll to work my frustration off of, otherwise I think I might've blew up my VCR.
 The names aren't the only bad thing. It was too short, not enough Kurama, and the words are just a little off. *cough cough* I speak a little Japanese, and I've seen the original Japanese version, and they completely screwed up what the characters are *trying* to say.
 Take my advice, save your money and your time, either get the second movie (SUBBED) or if you REALLY want to see this one, get the subtitled version.",969753600,11,1071,4.695187165775401
