8640593,1,B00IB5OO0S,"This remake for the clasic film from Carlos Enrique Taboada(in the sixties) doesn't make any justice to the original source.
Poor acting, uninspired direction and poor production values
If you have a good original clasic ghost tale you don't have to change it
You have to watch the original don't give a chance to the remake",1397520000,,324,4.803571428571429
