8559917,5,B00AZVQQ8Y,"SyFy teams up with Roger Corman to bring us a TV14 bikini/ cleavage cheese fest. Michael Madsen is the smart guy in the movie. On an island in Hawaii tourists, criminals, a movie set, botanists, and Madsen fight an impossible combination of a creature who is native to the Amazon.

The snake is computer generated and as bad as the acting. Kills are finalized with a blood mist spray. The sound track was good as it was something I would expect from ""Pulp Fiction.""

Great film for campy film lovers.",1363392000,,500,4.544444444444444
