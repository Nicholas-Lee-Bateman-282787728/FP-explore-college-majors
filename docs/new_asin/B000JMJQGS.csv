2677711,4,B000JMJQGS,"I expected the entire documentary to focus on the influence of Nietzche's writings on the ideology of National Socialism. But instead the first 1/3 is solely devoted to the rise of the Nazis. Topics discussed include how such a barbaric movement was able to achieve power in the modern, educated nation of Germany and the horrific devasation wrought by the Nazis, including the murder of over 12 million Jews, Slavs, homosexuals and others.

The middle portion explains the basics of Nietzsche's philosophy. Ideas discussed include his belief that Europe had been weakened by its acceptance of a Judeo-Christian ethic that promoted self-restraint and caring for the poor and sickly. Instead Nietzsche believed in striving for power, seeking risky adventure and the triumph of the strong over the weak. To achieve this people must stop depending on reason and return to their instinctual drives and impulses. This would eventually lead to a race of Supermen who would take humankind to new levels of greatness.

The final 1/3 discusses the similarities and differences between the beliefs of Nietzche and the Nazis. For example, while Nietzche was staunchly opposed to the Judeo-Christian tradition he was not actually anti-Semitic. In fact, Nietzche would have undoubtly been horrifed by many aspects of National Socialism, including the Holocaust. But it is also clear that the Nazis were heavily influenced by the writings of Nietzche and used them as an ideological justification for their murderous atrocities.

This doc serves as an excellent intro to the philosophy of Nietzche as well an interesting discussion of the relationship between his ideas and those of the Nazis.",1217980800,6,1679,5.280898876404494

2677713,5,B000JMJQGS,"Last weekend I had the good fortune to watch this fascinating, informative, and very disturbing DVD.

I am an avid fan of the History Channel and other forums exploring the theme that ideas have consequences but this piece of work was better than nearly everything else along these lines I have seen.

The Nazis, who murdered roughly 12 million people -- among them the 6 million plus or minus Jews we have all heard of -- were a really vicious bunch. But what is more interesting and important is that they were not barbarians but came from Europe's most educated population, the Germans.

Their main theme was the idealization of Das Volk, ""The People,"" not severally but collectively, as a noble tribe for the welfare and advancement of which everything could be sacrificed, especially individual liberty and independence.

Here was a group of fanatics who wholeheartedly believed in the righteousness of their own zealotry and urged it upon all their followers, of whom there were millions -- the Nazi party was voted into power several times and by the end some 90% of Germans voted for it. Hitler came to power democratically, by ""the will of the people"" (a phrase we have recently heard in these United States as well).

Nazism was openly in favor of irrationalism, championing instinct over reason, order over liberty, and self-sacrifice over the pursuit of happiness.

Nazis hated the classical liberal ideals represented by the United States of America; they despised free enterprise and imposed a version of socialism -- national socialism, to be precise -- wherever they could. The main difference between their version of socialism and that of the Soviet Union was that they advocated socialism for the nation, unlike the Soviets who wanted it spread internationally.

A persistent question that has bothered historians, psychologists, sociologists, and nearly anyone who has given the matter any thought is how this horrid regime could arise in the midst of a relatively civilized place like Western Europe and its crown jewel of a culture, Germany.

Many hypotheses have been advanced, including one in particular which has always been both intriguing and controversial. This is that certain ideas dominant in German culture had a great deal to do with the Nazi's rise to power. And the central figure who has been proposed as responsible for these ideas is the 19th century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche.

I will not give away the story Professor Hicks tells with such clarity and subtlety but I do wish to mention that as far as I can tell -- and I have studied some of these matters over my career as a philosophy teacher -- he gives a very well balanced presentation of just why Nietzsche did in fact encourage the Nazis and in what way his views differ from theirs quite significantly.

On first inspection, for example, it is not easy to believe that the Nazi's demand for subservience and unselfishness fit well with Nietzsche's ideal of ""the will to power."" But if one looks deep enough one will realize that the will to power was not to be put in the service of the individual person but of the tribe or culture.

Individual flourishing didn't interest Nietzsche; collective triumph did. And on this the Nazis fully agreed with him. No wonder they invoked his legacy over and over again in their literature.

On the other hand, Nietzsche would not likely have favored the sort of politicization of the ideal of the superman that the Nazis promulgated. He would have left politics aside concerning how the future of humanity was to unfold so long as it involved a revolution in our moral values. (He deemed conventional -- especially Judeo-Christian morality -- perverse, an enemy of a fully flourishing, instinct-driven human life!)

Professor Hicks' presentation is immensely rich with facts, quotations, analysis, and insight. Especially fascinating is the list of erudite Europeans -- Noble Laureates and the like -- who eagerly supported the Nazis, as well as the beloved Nazi slogans which are often exactly what our own politicians urge us to internalize -- for example, about the superiority of the public interest over the private one.

Anyone with just an ounce of interest in recent intellectual and political history will find watching this DVD a disturbing as well as riveting experience.",1181174400,24,4333,5.0
2677714,2,B000JMJQGS,"I have to say that when I finished watching this film I was a little disappointed.  Hicks provides an extensive history of the rise of the Nazi Party and a thorough overview of Nazi philosophy. He also provides an in depth overview of Nietzsche's philosophy, and a solid analytical discussion of the parallels and differences between the two philosophies.  In short, he provides 5 reasons to suggest that major parallels existed (e.g. Nietzsche's support of war as means of cultivating ""greatness"") and 5 major points of difference (e.g. Nietzsche's disdain towards German anti-semitism and German nationalism).

This is all fine and I generally agree with his points; he does, afterall, provide some very convincing evidence.  But his conclusion is almost childishly simplistic and (if you ask me) thoroughly anti-Nietzschean. After his comparative analysis, he immediately returns to a sort of unquestioning, modern, moralistic, liberal-democratic mind set, denouncing everything that the Nazis stood for, philosophically and practically, which he summarises in 5 simplistic dot-points (e.g. socialism, collectivism, nationalism, etc).  He then proceedes to outline what he thinks are the binary opposite values of what the Nazis stood for, such as capitalism, democracy, liberalism, etc, concluding by suggesting that if we want to avoid the rise of another National-Socialist regime in the future, we need to adopt the latter set of principles! He doesn't in any way indicate what Nietzsche might have thought of this proposal, or how the two ""opposite"" sets of principles might interact, or potentially be synthesised - quite bizarre for someone who has spent as much time as Hicks studying the anti-binary ideas of Nietzsche and post-Nietzschean philosophy.

But in the spirit of Nietzsche himself, this is, in the end, just my interpretation. And at least Hicks is honest enough to admit the same of his own views.",1180483200,40,1921,5.386666666666667
2677724,5,B000JMJQGS,"Stephen Hicks exceptional study is outstanding. After years of my study in all areas of the German Nazis, his research in Nietzsche's philosophical writings and the Nazis interpretations go hand to glove in understanding. It's obvious the criminal aspects of Hitler and his henchmen, particularly Goebbels, seized upon selected attributes of Nietzsche's work. Goebbels, being the Nazi mouthpiece, artfully seduced the masses on a course destined for destruction. Especially the youth, who sought a meaningful future, succumbed to the indoctrination of a system that promised order and leadership in a post WW-1 environment. This documentary should be required for all high school students. But then, teaching ""Civics"" should be required as well.",1368057600,,745,5.660714285714286
2677725,5,B000JMJQGS,"This DVD was my first encounter with the works of Stephen Hicks. Though one may wish to take this 3 hour lecture in 3 segments, it's got plenty of thought-proving ideas.

I majored in philosophy in graduate school, and I know firsthand how obtuse, abstract, and detached from reality philosophers can be. Perhaps they constitute the only professionals who actually make their subject matter seem irrelevant to life.

Now, enter Professor Hicks. He shows the supreme importance of philosophy to life, i.e., how ideas are the driving force behind social and political movements. In a fascinating study, he examines the ideas of an important philosopher, Nietzsche, and his influence on the Nazis. He also explains why it is crucial to understand the relationship between ideas and their implementation and application in the world so that we don't accept ideas like the Nazis did in the future, which will again lead to catastrophe.

A further example of how Dr. Hicks relates philosophy to life is in the method he chooses to express his findings. He doesn't just confine his study to students in a classroom, or to an academic journal. He brings his findings right into our homes through an entertaining, easy-to-follow video, with many photographs, works of art, and other arresting visuals to embellish his discussions. This approach to ideas and method of presenting them is much needed today. Bravo!",1359590400,2,1287,5.1826923076923075

2677728,4,B000JMJQGS,"Hicks' film makes valuable points in detailing Nietzsche's slave vs. master moralities and a brief dip into the Great Man vs. Tidal views of History, but he does stumble a bit when he claims, early on, that it is intellectuals that shape culture. Really? Rock music, jazz, rap, modern art, television, film. These are all the biggest purveyors of culture over the last century and none have been in the hands of intellectuals, who are more famously out of touch with common culture. Also, for such a historically scrupulous film, it's odd to see Hicks take Jesus Christ face value as a historic figure, despite not a shred of evidence in that camp, as well as buying in to the unsupported claims of mass Jewish enslavement in ancient Egypt. Granted, Nietzsche and others use this as the basis for the `understandings' of the Jewish mind, etc., but such nonsense should be dismissed as easily nowadays as phrenology. Another issue I take exception with is Hicks' claim that the Holocaust, or Nazi genocide, was unique in scale. It clearly was not, as King Leopold equaled or surpassed the Nazis, as did the Japanese during the same era, and Stalin killed two to four times as many people, while Mao Zedong killed up to ten times as many. Even Genghis Khan, eight centuries earlier, piled up a higher body count than Hitler and company.

  As someone who has always viewed human history as a string of placeholders between the really Great Men of history, I find much truck with Hicks' sober view of this life. He is thorough, detailed, provocative, and not willing to back down when he is definitively correct. A thing I think the film misses is the obvious fallacy of extremist thought- be it Nazi, Communist, Biblical, religious, Capitalistic, Zionistic, etc. The middle ground is clearly the best province for rational and productive societies, for only extreme times demand extreme measures, and 99.99% of life is interminably non-extreme. Nietzsche And The Nazis: A Personal View is a great documentary film, and a great piece of dialectic, art, and philosophy.

2677731,1,B000JMJQGS,"I watched the entire 2 hours and 50 minutes (twice) of this DVD. About 20 minutes into the ""personal view"" documentary a number of keyword alarm bells started to ring. Whenever I hear someone speak of ""altruism,"" ""collectivism,"" ""egoism,"" ""reason,"" ""individualism,"" and, of course ""socialism"" and ""capitalism,"" I sense the presence of Ayn Rand in the background.

I initially stopped the video and did some research on Prof. Hicks. Indeed, the man appears to be closely associated with Objectivism and was a ""Senior Fellow"" at the ""Objectivist Center"" and has published in the ""Journal of Ayn Rand Studies.""

In fact, a similar thesis was articulated by the Objectivists in 1983 in a book entitled-&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ominous-Parallels-A-Brilliant-Study-of-America-Today-and-the-ominous-parallels-with-the-chaos-of-pre-Hitler-Germany/dp/0452011175/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ominous Parallels: A Brilliant Study of America Today - and the 'ominous parallels' with the chaos of pre-Hitler Germany</a>&nbsp;with the following description-

""Ayn Rand chose Leonard Peikoff to be her successor as the spokesman for Objectivism. And in this brilliantly reasoned, thought-provoking work we learn why, as he demonstrates how far America has been detoured from its original path and led down the same road that Germany followed to Nazism. Self-sacrifice, Oriental mysticism, racial truth, the public good, doing one's duty--these are among the seductive catch-phrases that Leonard Peikoff dissects, examining the kind of philosophy they symbolize, the type of thinking that lured Germany to its doom and that he says is now prevalent in the United States. Here is a frightening look at where America may be heading, a clarion call for all who are concerned about preserving our right to individual freedom.""

Almost 30 years have passed... where are the parades of goose-stepping Americans? In fact, a perversion of Objectivist philosophy has been used to promote corporatism in America. Also, why wasn't there a reference to Peikoff's book and an acknowledgment of his work?

My main reason for giving this video a very low rating is that I believe it is completely disingenuous.  Ayn Rand and Objectivism are barely mentioned in the video yet its entire thesis is essentially an Objectivist view of history. This view can be summarized as-

Socialism = Nazism

or perhaps 'Nazis were evil... Nazis were ""Socialists"" therefore ""Socialism"" is evil.'

Despite much time spent explicating the philosophy of Nietzsche and its connection with Nazism, no cause and effect relationship is established... just a lot of ""on one hand"" and ""on the other hand"" style verbiage or simply a string of contradictory statements in which no conclusion can be drawn.

The last few minutes of the video tell the real tale. The author produces two columns of text listing the principles of ""Nazism"" and of ""Anti-Nazism.""  On one side we see the dark Nazi philosophical attributes of ""collectivism,"" ""socialism,"" ""authoritarianism,"" etc. and on the other side we see the beautiful and heroic Objectivist attributes of ""individualism,"" ""reason,"" etc. However, the author defines ""socialism"" as the ""central direction of the economy for the common good"" and ""capitalism"" as ""individual consumers deciding for themselves about what they will produce and spend.""  These trite definitions serve to highlight the simplistic construction of the arguments made in the video. ""Socialism"" and ""Capitalism"" encompass a vast range of human values, practices, attitudes, and beliefs. The video presents a typical Randian 2D view of reality. While watching the video, I couldn't help but think that Prof. Hicks sees himself as a Randian John Galt or Hank Rearden figure complete with black attire and theatrical side lighting.

I would have given this video a higher rating if it had been properly labeled as ""An Objectivist view of Nazism."" Otherwise, it's pure propaganda. Another reviewer seems to have had the same revelation. The only real value of the video is that it provides a good historical timeline of the rise of Nazism but at the cost of philosophical impartiality

As Ayn Rand was fond of saying- ""Ideas have consequences."" Unfortunately, this video doesn't really make the connection AND it's deceitful.",1334102400,7,4340,5.6061068702290076
2677732,4,B000JMJQGS,"It's always good to see a different view of history and events and speculate through a different set of eyes. An economist would view this through an economic filter. The overt reasoning of this documentary is to view it from a philosophical standpoint. True this is a philosophical presentation but probably nothing resembling what the title would imply.

The presenter starts off with a point by point reason why some revolutions succeed and some do not. And then a point by point presentation of why the National Socialist German Workers' Party succeeded from its foundation in Germany in 1919 to its coming of dominance in 1933. It appears that due to time restrictions the focuses on a narrow set of events and descriptions leaving out the broader environment. The key word is appears as this is just a commentary that describes their philosophy as a holistic socialism versus an economic socialism.

So far we've gone through general revolutions at a specific revolution which takes up the first half of the documentary time. As promised in the title we now move on to Nietzsche. The presenter (Stephen Ronald Craig Hicks is professor of philosophy at Rockford College) now speculates on the various philosophers and writers that some of the different revolutions were based on. And specifically once again on the rise of the National Socialist German Workers' Party. The focus is promised appears to be on Nietzsche. The keyword once again is appears. The presenter may or may not have taken Nietzsche had a context but his purpose was to show that the National Socialist German Workers' Party where the people that took Nietzsche out of context.

Just a side note even though this is not the main thrust of the presentation Stephen Hicks paints a few pictures of how different people view religions like Judaism and Christianity. There is also a small compare and contrast with fascism and socialism. Viewing this presentation I may have overlooked a few things however they were insignificant to the focus or purpose of this presentation.

This is a review so I have no intention of going step-by-step compare and contrast in soapbox style on what you will view here. I do suggest though that this is worth your time in viewing.

I have read some of Nietzsche. I have different translations of Mein Kampf. Oh yes I have also read all the major writings of Ayn Rand. Strange this presenter has also written"" Ayn Rand and Contemporary Business Ethics,"" now I wonder why (being a little facetious) the major points in this presentation from beginning to end are focused on the difference between individualism and collectivism. I suggest that the title of this presentation is just a way to lure you into this philosophy.

Then he talks about how Hitler killed 20 million, but ignores Britain killing the same amount in India.

2677734,3,B000JMJQGS,"The first thing you should know if you buy this DVD is that it is not a documentary.  There are no pieces of historical footage or talking head experts.  Other than the occasional still photo or graphic, it is basically several hours of one man lecturing, with scene changes to try and keep it interesting.  The cover says it is a ""personal view"" and this is the first hint that there is a purpose behind the project.

In the introduction, Hicks says something like ""these views (the ones held by the Nazis and supposedly derived from Nietzsche) are still alive today"" in a way that implies (to me) that we should be concerned.

My suspicions raised, I did a Google search for ""Leo Strauss Stephen Hicks"". Sure enough, Hicks' own website has an interview discussing the controversy surrounding noted Nietzsche scholar Leo Strauss and his supposed connection with US neoconservative politics. So, the hidden agenda behind this DVD is a left-liberal crusade.

I should add here that my own leaning is probably more left-liberal than anything else, so I have no objection to Hicks' political stance.  However, anyone buying this DVD should know what they are getting.

The big problem for this DVD as a first exposure to Nietzsche is that it is hopelessly biased from the start by placing him solely in the context of a discussion about the Nazis.  Of course it is a legitimate question to consider Nietzsche's relationship with Nazi ideology, and it is one that everyone interested in Nietzsche will have to tackle in a serious way at some stage.  However, taken out of context, the case is oversimplified.

Hicks does quote the fruits of Walter Kaufmann's rehabilitation of Nietzsche's reputation, in particular Nietzsche's anti-anti-Semitism and anti-German nationalism, but he neglects the detail regarding Nietzsche's sister Elizabeth's marriage to a rabid anti-Semite and her later management of Nietzsche's publications to push her own point of view.  The coverage of Nazi history also neglects their appointment of Prof Baumler to interpret and manipulate Nietzsche's work for Nazi purposes.

At the end of the lecture, Hicks systematically lists several points of disagreement between Nietzsche and Nazi philosophy, then several points of supposed agreement. The points of disagreement include Nietzsche's by now well-known criticism of ant-Semitism and German nationalism.  On the surface, Hicks looks to being impartial and even-handed.  However, the implication that Nietzsche would have agreed with the Nazis on certain principles is misleading.  Whilst we will never know what his reaction would have been, one can almost bet that the foundation of Nazism on an unquestioning ideology would have lead him to reject every Nazi tenet outright.

The ultimate proof of this lies in the very fact that Baumler, Elizabeth Forster-Nietzsche et al misrepresented and distorted Nietzsche's work by selective editing.  In other words, they selected the bits that seemed to reinforce their own ideas, and suppressed the remainder. The implication is that there was already a well-formed Nazi philosophy that used Nietzsche for support and credibility, not that Nietzsche was the driver and instigator of that philosophy in the first place.

Confirmation that Nietzsche was not the main driver of Hitler's views can be found in the book ""Hitler's private library"". I can't remember the exact quote, but when Hitler was asked about the authors that influenced him, Nietzsche in particular, his reply was that he viewed Nietzsche as more of a poet, and he was more influenced by the ideas of Schopenhauer (yes, really!).

Hicks also makes much of his own view (he admits that it is a controversial one) that Nietzsche's reputation for promoting individuality is wrong - that he favours collectivism.  Hicks did not convince me, and I think his argument is based on a shallow reading of Nietzsche and draws a very long bow regarding Nietzsche's notion of ""Master and slave"" morality.

Finally, Hicks' summary of Nazi philosophy and history makes it look as though anti-Semitism was isolated in Germany.  A better analysis would show that anti-Semitism was rife throughout Europe and Russia, even in France (Drumont et al) and England (Chamberlin et al). THIS was a significant reason why the Nazi ideology was able to take root in Germany - it reflected a widely-held belief of the age.

Anyone approaching this DVD with a little knowledge of the Third Reich and some reading of Nietzsche is unlikely to find anything new.  Indeed, they will miss all of Nietzsche's penetrating critiques of the Western basis of truth, reason and religion - together with his brilliant writing style. Whilst there are definitely elements in Hicks' presentation that must be dealt with in any overview of Nietzsche, this is not the whole story, and it would be a pity if would-be buyers of this DVD were put off further study by the views being presented.",1323561600,8,4933,5.120947630922693

Every American should see this presentation as a means of defensive knowledge, for Prof. Hicks exposes the primary tactics common to all totalitarians in controlling and brainwashing a people and using the many for the purposes of the few.
Knowing the signs of a creeping totalitarianism is critical for those who would want to protect their liberty and oppose collectivist ideologies in all its destructive forms.

2677737,5,B000JMJQGS,"Stephen Hicks should get a pat on the back for doing this presentation.  Rather than be content to just sit in his professors chair and impact a few undergrads each year, he saw a void and he made effort to step into.  I find that remarkably commendable -- the kind of thing that we should be giving our academics awards for.

In that way it reminded me of the popular video by Herb Meyer&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Siege-of-Western-Civilization/dp/B0002ZIVYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Siege of Western Civilization</a>.  It's really just a presentation.  In fact he probably shot a lot of it himself in areas around his house.  But it doesn't matter.  The content is good, and the application is direct.

What was that void?  Well we've all heard endlessly about the Nazis, but as Hicks lays out, we are mostly given unhelpful explanations for their rise -- things like Hitler being a madman, or the economic situation in Germany being bad, etc.  The problem is that these by themselves do not explain anything.  If Hitler was a ""madman"" then how did he get power in the first place?  And many countries had bad economies without being taken over by evil people.

The answer is ideas.  The Nazis did not arise out of nowhere.  They were giving political power to an ideology that had been developed many years before and was gaining sway among leading German intellectuals.  Sure they don't represent any one thinker like Neitzche exactly, but the correspondences are much stronger than we have been led to believe.

Hicks concludes with a powerful call to fight proto-Nazi idealogies in our culture rather than have to face them on the battlefield.  It's a compelling message and one that we all need.",1315699200,,1760,5.11578947368421

2677740,5,B000JMJQGS,"This 2 1/2 hour documentary is mostly a lecture (although to some degree all documentaries are lectures) about the Nazis and the philosopher. This may be a turnoff for some people, but actually this is an excellent film if you are interested in either topic. The first half deals exclusively with the Nazis and it explodes many of the myths that have been handed down through the decades. The socialistic aspect of the Nazis is highlighted, something which is rarely done; usually the emphasis is on the racism of the Nazis but the socialism is ignored---this is done particularly by socialist leftists. A second myth that is exploded is that the notorious bookburnings were not carried out by the government but by college students and that college students were some of the most fervent Nazis; to those of us who lived through the Sixties and Seventies and saw the ""student radicals"" and ""student activists"" (i.e., the Communists) in the United States, Western Europe and South America, this comes as no surprise at all.

Another myth is that the Nazis were anti-intellectual and had no support from the intelligentsia. This is not true. Many intellectuals did support the Nazis (cf. a book The Appeal of Fascism on just this topic) and their attacks on certain other intellectuals and ideas were done because those persons or ideas were the opposite of what they themselves advocated. Again, you find the very same attitude from the Sixties to the present day in universities: anyone who voices or writes an opinion or fact that is not Politically Correct will find himself disembowled by other intellectuals.

Specifically, during the Seventies a philosopher by the name of Kauffman hit the jackpot by claiming that the Nazis had misused Nietzsche and that Nietsche was no foundation of the Nazi movement. This claim was true only if you ripped out several chapters of the philosopher's writings, but it did not matter and Kauffman, like I said, hit the jackpot telling leftists what they wanted to hear.

2677741,1,B000JMJQGS,"OK to a point on the Nazis, a catastrophe on Nietzsche.

This film is a series of three lucid and well-organized talks. Hicks's strengths as a lecturer will draw and retain a lot of people, which is unfortunate in light of his gross inaccuracies.

In Part I, Hicks argues forcefully that Nazism was not some kind of contagious insanity, but rather a cogent worldview whose reasoning might be attractive to a lot of people.

In Part II, Hicks takes us on a superquick tour of N's most inflammatory statements, then offers a superquick course correction that doesn't quite acquit N. on charges of anti-Semitism and espousing ""master/slave morality.""

In Part III, Hicks renders a split decision on whether N's philosophy gives aid and comfort to the Nazis. I nearly fainted when he said that N. offers support for governmental genetic engineering.

N. was a brilliant writer who described the views he rejected better than their own proponents did. Cut and pasted, such passages can be made to sound as though the author espouses them. As Nietzsche wrote them, however, they were descriptions, not recommendations. N. was on record as a life-long opponent of anti-Semitism and a merciless critic of the nation-state. He was revolted by the idea of the superior German Volk. It's a puzzle how, at this late date, Hicks can say anything else.

Two far better documentaries on the Nazis are available: ""The Goebbels Experiment"" (based on readings from G's diaries, showing how one talented and ambitious man opted for Nazism) and ""The Architecture of Doom"" (which presents Nazism as a serious aesthetic philosophy, thus agreeing with Hicks that it was a type of ruthless idealism).

For getting an accurate grasp on Nietzsche, books are better than films. Two engaging and classic works are ""Nietzsche: The Man and His Philosophy"" by R.J. Hollingdale and ""Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist"" by Walter Kaufmann.

They'll both give you the straight dope, but Hollingdale is shorter and easier to read because he folds the philosophy into the biography. Kaufmann is both longer and more dense. He gives a brief biography, then goes for straight philosophy, albeit developmentally presented.

Kaufmann is definitely accessible to the serious reader, but he might constitute ""too much information"" for a lot of people. I value these two works equally.",1306713600,11,2356,5.146596858638744
2677742,1,B000JMJQGS,"I have studied Nietzsche for many years.  Believe me, if you read one of Nietzsche's texts and think you get it, you are already doing something wrong.  Without the forced reflections, and without spending a lot of effort thinking through Nietzsche's many figures and thoughts, you aren't really ""reading Nietzsche.""  THIS FILM WILL NOT TEACH YOU ANYTHING ABOUT NIETZSCHE.  HOWEVER, IT WILL EXEMPLIFY A REALLY BAD METHOD FOR DECIPHERING AND INTERPRETING BOTH HISTORY ITSELF AND IMPORTANT PHILOSOPHICAL TEXTS. Nietzsche was not a Nazi, and in no fair minded view can anyone make the case that Nietzsche's thought is formative or precipitates the historical formation of Fascism. I don't just disagree with the filmmaker's ""interpretation"" of SOME of Nietzsche's most widely disseminated, hence most misunderstood ideas, but with this entire project.  First off, the sole thesis of this film (I'm reluctant to call it a documentary since it is more like an episode of 'Reading Rainbow' than a look at a historical moment) is that ""Nietzsche's thinking (i.e. a reduced set of principles attributed to Nietzsche) is conducive to Nazism and despotism and is incompatible with the free, democratic Western values.  This film abandons critical thinking, close reading and general intellectual sophistication for a chance to promote US neo-liberalism/exceptionalism and associate one of humanity's most enriching and influential thinkers.  This is really just the product of someone who thinks they can reduce a philsopher's thinking to a few ethical positions.  The author of this text misunderstands the role of philosophy altogether.  This movie looks like a high school project hosted by a failed TV actor pretending to be an academic.  He really should have spent much more time studying Nietzsche's philosophy.  It seems like he read a few introductory books on Nietzsche and then read their results into the body of Nietzsche's work.  Rather than grappling with the complexity of Nietzsche's thought, this man has chosen instead to make the same mistakes concerning Nietzsche's philosophical body of work (which itself never fully coheres into anything one might use as the basis for a political system) as the Nazis themselves had.  The greater irony here is that he seems to have conducted his research into Nietzsche on his own without working through it with colleagues like academic work is usually conducted, i.e. with the input of other perspectives.  While he promotes community and democracy, he also models a really embarrassing figure of a renegade intellectual, free from academic ""limitations.""  What he fails to understand is that fascism is akin to that very isolation, the disappearance of the social.  If this film has any significance, it is as evidence that people are still abusing and misusing history and philosophy.  In all honesty, it seems like the man who made this movie just wanted to pretend he was an academic for a while.  I would advise him to read more carefully and advise all of you to pretend this was never made.  Please read an ""Introducing Nietzsche"" book.  One page from that will give you more than this seriously negligent document ever can.",1302566400,11,3182,5.214145383104126

Also, many either glorify Nietzsche or portray him as ""evil"" instead of taking the even handed approach that this documentary takes.

2677748,5,B000JMJQGS,"This documentary is an unusually fine example of what philosophy can do when it's done properly.  Stephen Hicks takes the viewer on a information rich tour of the intellectual history of 20th Century Germany.  His presentation is scholarly, fastidious, and fair.

Hicks refuses to completely acquit Nietzsche of responsibility for Nazism, but he doesn't stoop to cheap caricatures, either.  Nietzsche, no pale criminal, would likely accept responsibility for everything Hicks levels at him.  After all, to call Nietzsche ""dangerous"" is merely to appreciate him in full.

But Hicks is not merely doing positive intellectual history.  This video essay is also a normative philosophical endeavor.  Hicks takes the unfashionable view that ideas have consequences, that they drive history.  Hicks appreciates that Nazism was a highly sophisticated and fully-articulated philosophy.  As Walter put it The Big Lebowski, ""Say what you want about National Socialism dude - it's an ethos.""  Nazism was not a spasm of madness, but a coherent response to perennial questions.  It is not enough that we dismiss Nazism, or simply forget it; in the long run it's certain to emerge once again.  Instead, Hick holds, we have to engage it - and engage Nietzsche - to determine and then to prove where each goes wrong and why.

Hicks sees philosophy as a sort of ideological bomb squad, dispatched to dismantle rogue ideologies before they become catastrophes.  As thrilling as I find this notion, my view is a bit more cynical.  In 1930's Germany, Hicks has identified one of the few points in the last 2000 years when philosophy had some causal traction on the highway of world history - and in that instance the result was not pretty.

Still, if you're interested in these things you'll be hard-pressed to find a more engaging three hours of television anywhere.",1285027200,35,1846,5.120401337792642

2677750,3,B000JMJQGS,"This is really a very peculiar piece of work.  On the one hand, one cannot deny that it gives an admirably clear (if somewhat pedantic), accurate, and (even!) sympathetic introduction to the essentials of each of its two subjects.  I particularly admired the careful account of Nietzsche's concepts of master and slave morality. On the other hand, the conclusions it draws about Nietzsche's implied ""responsibility"" for Nazism are extremely weak given the tremendous build-up (over two hours), and its dubbing Nietzsche a ""Proto-Nazi"" is not only unsupported, but, given the evidence presented, irresponsible to the point of being slanderous.  The author makes the case that the three most important elements of National Socialism were (surprise, surprise) socialism, nationalism, and (perhaps as a part of its version of nationalism, or as a consequence of it) anti-Semitism.  And Nietzsche? Well, the author shows convincingly (and correctly in my view) that Nietzsche was....ANTI-socialist, ANTI-nationalist, and ANTI-anti-Semitic!  Rather a let down. But the really big surprise comes when it is *nevertheless* argued that Nietzsche was a ""Proto-Nazi""!  In support of this, the author goes on to point out that Nietzsche and the Nazis shared an admiration for war and a hatred of democracy and liberal political ideals. True enough. However, if that is sufficient to make one a ""proto-Nazi,"" as the author suggests, virtually every major political figure in the pre-modern period was a proto-Nazi. It is also claimed that both Nietzsche and the Nazis were something called ""collectivists."" But this vague term turns out to conceal a very important difference between Nietzsche and the Nazis -- a difference that is arguably much more important than their shared ""collectivism.""  Suppose we ask what the ""collectivity"" is that is held to be the summum bonum for each.  For the Nazis, it is the nation-state -- a view Nietzsche clearly and repeatedly repudiated.  For Nietzsche, the highest good is humanity -- the human species -- as a whole.  This is hardly the Nazi view. Nietzsche was indeed an advocate of sacrificing individuals for the good of (a future) humanity.  That sounds to me more Mr. Spock than Hitler, and at least as defensible as the so-called ""individualism"" espoused by the author (which sounds suspiciously like protecting the ""rights"" of the capitalist to make his profit even if future humanity should perish as a result). Finally, there is a supposedly shared ""irrationalism.""  Again, this vague and ambiguous term conceals more than it reveals.  The upshot of the Nazi's irrationalism was ""Don't think, let yourself be swept up in the emotions of the crowd and then do as you are told"" (namely, march off to your fate as cannon fodder).  For Nietzsche, the upshot was the Romantic Emersonian sentiment that one should not lose sight of the instincts that constitute your unique self by talking oneself out of one's desire to heed them. As Nietzsche says, our instincts may sometimes be more true and ""rational"" than our (so-called) ""reason."" In short, the Nazis' irrationalism was in the service of what Nietzsche would call ""herd-morality,"" whereas Nietzsche's was in the service of something we might more justly call ""individualism.""",1270944000,8,3264,5.251923076923077

I chip in here largely to validate some of those comments, as we all like to know, when browsing reviews, if there is a consensus or if we are merely reading idiosyncratic reactions.

Where were the lecturers like Professor Hicks when I was in college?  He performs an amazing feat in delivering a nearly three-hour-long lecture that kept me glued to my seat.  The only fault with the presentation, IMO, was that it occasionally became overly simplistic, repetitive, and didactic, especially toward the end.  For a student taking notes, this would be a dream come true.  In fact, the presentation was so lucid and organized that note-taking would be superfluous.  It was satisfying to get up at the end with the feeling of having acquired a coherent background and explanation about the common themes of Nazism and Nietzsche rather than just a vague impression about it.  (The wise viewer will recognize that while it is convenient to have this Cliffs's Notes grasp of the material, reality is rarely as tidy as this presentation.)

Like some others, I was surprised at how much I learned about the Nazis.  I knew already a little about that topic and expected to be most engaged on the specifically Nietzsche side of things.  I learned ~a lot~ about where the Nazis were coming from.  Although a lot of Nazi history was treated in the early part of the presentation before Nietzsche was ever mentioned, in the end it was a tightly meshed presentation.  As the titles says, it was truly about Nietzsche ~and~ the Nazis, about the overlap of their ideas.

I have a lot of courses from The Teaching Company which are said to present the very best courses from our very best college teachers.  Not one of those courses has ever held my interest in the way that Professor Hick's lecture did.

The whole video is a much longer treatment of historically relevant broad ideas (including Nietzsche's) that influenced Hitler and Germany in the 1930s. I found it fascinating, but too much for my purposes as a 10th grade teacher.

But the 2-3 segments on Nietzsche fill a gap for my students in our studies of ""--isms"" of the 19th century. I don't expect them to read deeply in the works of most of the philosophers we consider, but I do provide them pertinent excerpts t hat help them to understand their main tenets. It was hard for me to nail down short pieces of Nietzsche, however, and when left to their own devices (read: ""google search"") the students hardly came back with more than ""N said God is dead and he believed in nothing."" Since that was hardly the scholarly approach I'd hoped for their investigations, I had to step in and scafflold a bit more.
