It is very important that the singer understands their body as a whole rather than only seeing themselves as their throat. That alone makes a good reason to purchase the DVD. I have spent more money on voice teachers who tell me similar things found in this video for under $10. However, I find the instructor to be boring. The video drags on and the music sucks. But if you keep an open mind, you will appreciate the video for what it is: baby step exercises for vocalists. You don't see voice lessons for $6.99 everyday.",1389052800,,602,4.635514018691588
8168545,5,B000MGB7LI,"I always had a bizarre fascination with music despite having two tone deaf parents. I tried some online tutorials and books but when the limitations of that medium began to show in my progress it was time to find a professional.

I experienced a lot of mediocrity before realizing what I really need is a 360 producer / musician and his/her ear. In his studio Breck plays all the instruments, controls the board during recording and does all the post but it is his ear that I value the most. By way of his comprehensive / do it all approach to music there is not a thing he could not teach me. We record our sessions each week and I listen back to pick up the finer points and practice at home with a $200 usb mic and garage band both of which are shockingly good.

Bottom line is you can get started online and in books but you cannot reach the next level without a professionals great ear and who better than an accomplished singer / song-writer who  produces bands in his own studio?",1377043200,,986,4.318918918918919

All the techniques in this level lead to the next series of events that teach you to navigate difficult singing.  Of any style!  The warm up is key and you have to stay focused during it.  If you go on auto pilot while doing the exercises and just keep hoping they are going to make you better, then you're missing the point.  Learning to sing difficult music requires some assembly of the voice.  Some coordination skills more than anything else.  And no, I'm not a hardcore heavy metal singer or teacher.  The material in this product is almost identical to the material in the other instruction programs I have.  But anyone who thinks the core fundamentals in singing Metal is different from other styles is sadly mistaken.  Great Metal singers learn to use good technique and then attach the kinds of resonance found in Heavy Metal to that solid singing foundation.  If they don't they are (and sound like it) faking it.  And their voices do not last long.  The voice is very specific about how much you can abuse it.

So good luck to all.  I wish you the best in your pursuits of singing.",1303862400,,1113,4.522613065326633
