7985912,3,B00008O2ZI,"This is pretty good, certainly better than other Peach DVDs I've seen.  I have one other Peach DVD with the multi-angle ability which was only ok to play with sometimes but not always that useful - here it's really useful for the ""club"" stripping scenes and also ""wet t-shirt"" scenes since the angles are not only different distances but different spots around the stage and none are those silly ""creep camera"" hiding behind objects or whatever.  So with a girl dancing around a pole, it's useful to have multiple cameras so you don't miss anything.  Not all scenes have three cameras however - some only have two and at least one of them had only one (though that scene is on a bed and the camera is the perfect distance - intimate but no myopic ultra zooming).  But the multiple angles was useful in every scene that had them.

I was also very happy that there was PLENTY of full explicit nudity here... plenty of genital closeups and several girls had some succulent meaty labia.  Although mostly it's reserved as far as hand touching - you do get a lot of open leg shots or butt in the air on her knees positions but the hands usually just pass over with no grip - here and there some girls did do as much squeezing/spreading as they could get away with and gave some little glances of pink and certainly stretched anus to go with it.

I'm cool with ""unconventional beauty"" in the sense that lots of strippers are single moms or whatever, so yes implants are a bit prevalent and so are a few stretch marks, flattish butts, and other signs of maturity.  If anything I thought these girls could be a bit more curvy but hey, muscular stripper legs and all that.  A few of them were pretty voluptuous.  3 and a half minutes is definitely too short though - you blow half of that just taking it off and then you barely have anything left for teasing and showing.  Some of the good scenes are longer though, upwards of 6 or 7 minutes.  But it means there is a move-along-now pace and therefore a certain playful brevity to everything, no real erotic lingering or enough repetition to get you truly going.  Well, it was worth checking out for 4 bucks...",1425254400,2,2150,4.454081632653061
7985913,5,B00008O2ZI,Absolutely hilarious. A good portion of the film is about their personal journey rather than the XXX aspect. And this is a bitch fest the entire time. Their interactions are hilarious and I love it. Greatest purchase I've made in a long time,1407283200,,241,4.627906976744186
7985914,3,B00008O2ZI,Good movie. Some of the girls were nice,1404086400,,39,4.0
7985915,3,B00008O2ZI,"This is old-school Peach, from 2003, so if you're familiar with this company's DVDs from the era you know the formula: Lots of interactive bells and whistles and many haggard-looking women with ghastly misshapen breast implants and flat butts. Also for the most part, poor direction.

This barely charts at three stars for me. The explicit nudity puts it  over the top, but overall I can't recommend this. The idea is kind of fun--it's a first-person ""drive"" through  an interactive map; each spot on the map gives the viewer options on this fake road trip. The ""right"" choices open doors to strip shows, while the wrong ones bounce you back to the main menu, after little clips where you're insulted for making the incorrect decisions. But the girls nearly all are homely and the stripping vignettes are for the most part bad--unsexy dancing, clips that run between three and five minutes (I'm not opposed to brief vignettes--I usually like them, but for stripping, three and half minutes is just too short). And it all adds up to a really brief run time, most of it spent on the setup. This same idea has been carried out much more effectively in other DVDs.

Peach really grew and improved as a company by the time that 2008 or 2009 rolled around, signed much more-attractive women and learned that the rear of a  woman actually exists. This is a trip back through time when Peach wasn't there yet.",1373500800,2,1401,4.702040816326531
7985916,3,B00008O2ZI,"I never have quite figured out this DVD. I mean, it's supposed to be interactive if you go through the first menu choice, called ""Hit the Road."" The selections are on a map that's hard to read. When you click on some ""location,"" you then see the 2 stars, Lexy And Teri, driving there. These 2 ladies are hot and are probably both in their 20s, though one may be in her late teens, and there are a bunch of other ladies on here as well. Usually they get fully nude. Yet this interactive section is very tedious and pointless. It adds a bunch of extra slop when you just want to see the girls, and is kind of frustrating to have to choose the next scene on the map over and over. Why not just have a continuous film?

Fortunately, you can click on ""Play all"" and get just the hot scenes one after the other, which are quite decent. Most are strip-teases in various settings - some in clubs, some in a house, some with a strange multi-colored background added. But my favorite scene is in an aptly named hot tub, with a dozen cute ladies splashing around in their birthday suits. That scene runs about 7 minutes, which is about what most run on here, but I wish it ran 30. On Play All I doubt that the whole thing runs as much as an hour.

Also, in most scenes you can choose from 3 different cameras, so that's helpful. And there's a decent photo section, as well as some outtakes. One brunette that's on here is especially sexy. She's in the hot tub and also does a strip-tease. I saw her on a Playboy DVD too, but I don't know her name. Anyway, if you get this DVD, just go to ""Play All,"" and forget the strange interactive section!",1188086400,6,1632,4.210862619808307
7985917,3,B00008O2ZI,"Well If you were looking for a game were you get to play with strippers then this is the place to go. If you were looking to see more than a nude strip joints limits you will be disappointed. The girls do not let you down though. They are major hotties with great bodies, there is a great choice all along the way. I only gave it 3 stars because it has a very lame section in it. But all the rest is pure gold.",1176249600,,410,3.835294117647059
7985918,1,B00008O2ZI,I just finished watching this thing they call a movie.  First off these girls look like they are in their mid 40's.  Another thing is they give you like two options.  The acting is horrible and it is not worth your $18.00.  I enjoy more hardcore stuff compared to girls just stripping and that is all this was.  Very dissapointed.,1135900800,2,330,4.433333333333334
7985919,5,B00008O2ZI,"Road Strip has you out on the road en route to spring break where you meet Teri and Lexi, two hot hitchhikers ready and willing to do whatever you want them to. On this DVD you can enjoy multiple angles, bonus scenes, and a special voyeur cam.",1131926400,6,243,4.191489361702128
7985920,4,B00008O2ZI,"If you are... be sure to pack plenty of clean drawers because with hot girls like these you're bound to have an accident. But hopefully not until you've experienced all that is ""spring break""..... interactively speaking of course. That's right folks, you can take a road trip, have complete control over the wheel (remote control), while a couple of babes ride shotgun, and still make it in time for dinner made by the Mrs.... Totally worth buckling up for!!!",1078790400,5,459,4.822784810126582
