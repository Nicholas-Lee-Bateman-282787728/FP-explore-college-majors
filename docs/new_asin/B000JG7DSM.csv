8150226,5,B000JG7DSM,"A great video which endearingly features stars such as Bo Derek, Patrick Swayze, Zsa Zsa Gabor, William Shatner, Juice Newton et. al. In fact refreshingly surprising. ... I had this years ago ... loaned it to someone who ""forgot"" to return it.
I would likely buy it again in the event it becomes available on DVD. However, if you want to spend over $60.00+ on a VHS, you won't be disappointed! I miss being able to watch it once in a while. ""Hollywood on Horses"" is something one could watch over and over without becoming bored!",1451433600,,529,4.520833333333333
