3873144,4,B0028RABS4,"This is a great movie about nationalism and trying to right a wrong of history.  The Stone of Destiny deals with idealistic university students driven by a strong sense of nationalism devise a plan to steal back the famed Stone of Scone from the English.  With high hopes, little money and a sketchy plan, they set off for London to break into Westminster Abbey and grab the coronation stone of Scottish kings.  With humour thrown in for good measure, it is an enjoyable film.  A good cast makes the film work: Charlie Cox (The Merchant of Venice), Billy Boyd (Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Master and Commander, The Flying Scotsman), Robert Carlyle (Trainspotting, The Full Monty, Hamish MacBeth), and Kate Mara (We Are Marshall) headline.",1265155200,27,737,4.872
3873145,5,B0028RABS4,"Good story, and it's true! The film is a little long, but I'll give it a resounding yes and lift my glass of scotch to this film and the homeland!",1265155200,,146,3.9
3873146,4,B0028RABS4,"This is the compelling story of how some college kids from Scotland were energized enough, at the same time being quite clever, to be able to break into Westminster Abbey and retreive the ""Stone of Destiny"" (also known as the ""Stone of Scone"") and take it back to Scotland. The story relives this adventure, written about by Ian Hamilton who is portrayed in the film very well. There is danger, romance and typically Scottish nationalism on display here. The scenes are well done and visually interesting to watch. It is a dynamic and well-done film based almost entirely on true events and Ian Hamilton's book as well. Good job.",1260576000,2,629,4.779816513761468
3873147,5,B0028RABS4,"It is hard to imagine in the modern UK - blanketed as it is with CCTV, armed police units and security cordons that some students - who drove from Glasgow to London in the middle of the night just before Xmas 1950 - could break into Westminster Abbey, bungle things a few times and still get away with Scotland's ceremonial stone used to crown Scots kings in times past.  Innocent times indeed.

The film contains elements of the Keystone Cops - but if you have ever read Ian Hamilton's accounts of the recovery of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stone-of-Destiny/dp/184158729X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stone of Destiny</a>&nbsp;it was pretty much like the film portrays - even the scene near the end with the travelling people. Perhaps the only thing glossed over was the feeling of gross betrayal when the stone was voluntarily returned and the fact the authorities decided not to risk a trial and lose the case to Ian Hamilton's rather well argued points of law as to why he and his companions had merely recovered stolen property.

The film also stars parts of the City of Glasgow set dressed to look like 1950; a significant portion of the cars of the era from the Glasgow Museum of Transport; the real Westminster Abbey and Glasgow University.  Also watch out for the real Ian Hamilton's 5 second, non-speaking, cameo appearance!

In this day and age it is hard to find safe family movies - but this one is - a REAL tale of derring-do and robbery which it is safe to let the kids watch.",1257552000,33,1541,4.957364341085271
3873148,5,B0028RABS4,"I first found out about this movie because Billy Boyd is in it (I'm a big Lord of the Rings fan) and I'm glad I did because this movie is great! It tells the true story of four university students in Glasgow deciding to ""steal"" back the Stone of Scone which was used as the royal coronation stone since before Robert the Bruce and was stolen by the English King Edward. Ian Hamilton (the main character) wrote a book on their adventures and he actually helped in the movie making process and has a cameo appearance in the film. In my opinion it's worth the watch just for the Scottish accents, but it's so much better than that! It's a touching story of a young man's yearning for his countrymen to be proud of their Scottish heritage. By the end of the movie you're wishing you were Scottish (well, unless you are).  The only regret I have with this film is the amount of language. While not a horrible amount, it's enough to be wary of family viewing. I've seen it twice already and it makes me want to go back to Scotland again! (The Stone is currently in Edinburgh Castle, which I've been to but somehow I missed seeing the stone :( but I've also been to Arbroath Abbey which is visited toward the end of the film and it's amazing!)",1257206400,5,1236,4.327586206896552
3873149,5,B0028RABS4,We visited Scotland this summer and saw the Stone on display in Edinburgh Castle.  The attendant in the display room told us about the movie.  She said it was a good lighthearted presentation of how the Stone got to Edinburgh.  We weren't disappointed.  The whole family enjoyed the movie.  It also captured a sense of how proud the Scottish people are of their country - Scotland - not Britain.  We loved our trip to Scotland and the movie gave us a better understanding of the importance of the Stone.,1254009600,6,503,4.595505617977528
3873150,5,B0028RABS4,"Stone of destiny is a lovely film, capturing the mood and period well.  It's a pity this wasn't a bigger hit at the cinema but it is well worth seeing, especially the scenes at the end which were shot in Arbroath Abbey where the Declaration of Arbroath was signed by Robert the Bruce. (The American Declaration is based on this document).

Heartwarming and exciting without guns or violence - perfect!!",1249948800,30,402,4.728571428571429

3873152,5,B0028RABS4,"I had heard ""something"" about this stone story many years ago. Being, according to my DNA, about 50% Scottish, I was interested is hearing the full story even if it was in a history book.  The acting was very good, the countryside, the abby and the pub filmography were all excellent, and I imagine there were some ""hollywood liberties"" that but the story was told. There were a couple of short slow scenes but basically it was a great movie.",1516147200,,442,4.525

3873159,5,B0028RABS4,"This movie touched home for me. I am an American living in the United States whose family has been here for hundreds of years. Long before the Europeans ever knew we existed, we lived here. There are many of us here who feel that our Country is no longer ours and that the things that we believed in...freedom...justice...the pursuit of happiness...are being stripped away from us by the wealthy and privileged ""new money"" Monarchy. The Trump Regime. The hateful rhetoric of our current Administration has made people of color look like criminals. We are called drug dealers. Rapists. Leeches. Undesirables. ""Bad hombres."" I live in a small borderland community that has had a diverse population of immigrants and domestics alike, working together and living together. But now we have been told that our community is ""Ground Zero"" and our home has been invaded by ICE and Homeland Security who are the true undesirables. And we are fighting back. Our local law enforcement is working with the community and takes very seriously their motto ""To Serve and Protect."" We protect our immigrants here. We do not have to live in fear of being questioned for ""papers"" or ""documents"" and being deported to a country that we have never seen. Because it IS happening. Maybe one might see this as a movie about kids stealing a stone. Maybe it's silly to some. Juvenile. But when you live under the shadow of rulers that feel entitled to strip anybody of their basic human rights to live, work and raise families peacefully, then symbolism becomes relevant and hope becomes essential. Cities across our country are taking stands and taking back their ""Stones of Destiny."" Yeah, this movie definitely hit home for me.",1514505600,5,1703,4.916666666666667

3873164,4,B0028RABS4,"The Stone of Destiny may be an modern day relic that survived the flood with Noah on the Arc; even going back to Adam and Eve and the practice of blood sacrifice the two metal rings used to lash the Lamb in place and the trough below the metal rings to allow the blood to flow to either side into bowels used to sprinkle the blood upon the tabernacle.  it was likely the same stone Abraham lashed Isaac to in the process of obeying God's instructions in preparation to make a blood sacrifice. it was also likely the Stone of Jacob carried with him as he fled from Esau the one upon which Jacob placed hid head to sleep when the vision of the ladder going up into heaven appeared and he was given by God the promised land to rule.it was also likely the very same stone Carried with Moses as the Hebrews left Egypt for the promised land; the same stone Moses stuck with his staff to bring forth the living water that sustained them in the desert flowing until they reached the promised land.  It is a legend that the stone returned to Egypt with David's royal family the daughters of Zedekiah and from Egypt went with Teia Tephi, a daughter of Zedekiah by sea through Europe and Asia to be shipwrecked upon the shores of Ireland where the reigning King of Ireland fell in love with princess Teia Tephi; the Lia Fail, the Stone of Destiny, remained with Irish Kings for over a millennium, and then in 503 AD taken to Scotland by Irish King Fergus to be Crowned as King of Scots.",1513382400,2,1475,4.32129963898917

3873166,2,B0028RABS4,"Wow, am I glad I watched this on Prime and didn't pay to rent it.  If the liberators of the stone were truly this inept, I'm surprised they were able to tie their own shoes, let alone successfully remove the Stone of Scone from the Coronation Chair and get it back to Scotland without being caught.  The plot of this film is padded out with plenty of passing of the Idiot Ball on the level of the old Little Rascals films and a quasi-romance was shoe-horned in to make up a feature length film, but take that away and you'd barely have enough decent material for a 43 minute television episode.  They did at least cast some truly wonderful actors, but even they couldn't save this dreck.  The two stars are for the cast.",1512777600,,720,4.350746268656716

The acting,  cinematography, music,  costumes and writing all came from the heart.  Considering the long term historical perspective of Scotland and the UK it gives pause for Her Majesty to give the stone formally back to Scotland free and clear.  Who knows?

Although today it's a different world, even still, within the hearts of young Scottish men, there lies a yearning for courage, bravery and freedom like William Wallace once displayed in the Scotland of old. And like one of William Wallace's Highland raids, these boys, and one girl, stole the Stone of Destiny in the dead of night, bringing it back home to Scotland where it always belonged. The tale is simple yet very inspiring, especially today with corruption and oppression all around us. We all crave freedom from something in our lives and Ian Hamilton, the mastermind of the theft, accomplished just that when he freed himself from his own oppression and longing for a brave, free Scotland again. In doing so, he gave strength to the souls of all Scots. Let this story remind us that despite the odds, anything is possible, even in today's world, that we CAN create our own path....and that we must never stop trying to if we want to keep our hearts alive.

The cast as individuals were all excellent, but their dynamic together was what stood out so brightly.
As for the history of An Lia Fail, the stone, I have read so much about it I did not think it remotely possible for a film to capture the spiritual community importance of it, but I was pleasantly surprised by it. I highly recommend this film!",1505779200,4,629,4.675675675675675

Also, since it was based on a true story, they could have added some kind of aftermath and deleted some of the other scenes to grab your attention a bit more.

Early in the movie, the main character said that Scottish people were ashamed to be Scottish. Unfortunately, many Americans feel that way as well. Thankfully, there is a growing movement in the USA to be proud to be American and to support decisions that protect our country and our fellow Americans. In a family, it makes perfect sense to make sure your children have enough food before you give food to your neighbors. It makes perfect sense for a country to make sure the major needs of its own citizens are met before meeting the needs of other countries. Of course, they can be done at the same time, but it is important to make sure major needs of its own citizens are met first. A country in debt for trillions of dollars is not in a position to help other countries. What will be our symbol to awaken the hearts of Americans, to rally us all together?

I did not find the brogue to be harsh in any way, and understood it perfectly.  I was moved by the patriotism of this film, and by the act itself.  I recently watched an episode of ""Antique Roadshow"" in England, and the removal of the stone was discussed.  I believe their is a story that the real stone is actually hidden somewhere in Scotland.  The stone on ""loan"" may not be the historic stone at all.  I like what was said at the end of the movie when they were being arrested ""the children of Scotland"" brought back the stone.  This movie is a 5 Star movie to me, and well worth watching.

3873330,3,B0028RABS4,"I watched this movie because of a recommendation from a friend at work after the Scottish vote for independence.  Though the movie isn't the greatest of flicks, the deep-seated wish of the youth for Scotland to become an independent nation was a very hot subject in the 1950's as well. Unfortunately, it appears the older generation, though passionate about their Scottish ancestry, still wish to be part of the union.

Nevertheless, the Stone of Destiny is a movie based off of a true story.  I stumbled across the tale while watching the Secrets of Westminster on PBS that talked about the stone of destiny underneath the coronation chair in Westminster Abbey.  The stone is from Scotland, and when a king or queen is crowned, the stone, of course, represents that they are also king and queen of Scotland and thereupon they sit!

However, one young lad from Glasgow decided that the stone needed to be returned to Scotland where it belonged.  He and a group of his friends drive to London, break into the abbey, steal the stone, and take it back to Scotland.  It's a rather lighthearted movie of love of country and the determination to keep Scotland separate from the United Kingdom.  Eventually, of course, the stone was returned, and they were arrested for their dastardly deed.  The good news is that England had the sense not to prosecute them for the theft, which was no doubt done to keep the peace.

The movie, of course, isn't an Oscar-worthy flick.  But the true story of one brave young man's audacity to break into the abbey and steal the stone from underneath the coronation chair is worth kudos in itself.",1412035200,6,1622,4.736654804270462

In the 1950's, inspired by a speech on Scottish independence, five teenagers planned a raid to get the stone back to Scotland. And what they went through to get it back was grueling, exciting and inspiring beyond words.

3873346,5,B0028RABS4,"My Dear Fellow Americans,

I cannot believe my luck.  Blockbuster had a clearance and only a few videos left and I found this gem.  The only one of this movie on the shelf.  Best couple of dollars I've spent in years.  Right off the bat I see a similarity to 1950 Scotland and the United States today.  We are being lied to and controlled by the powers that be and feeling totally helpless.  In need of a shot in the arm of patriotism.

God Bless the youth that still have the innocence and energy to bring back to life a country that has given in. At least the youth in 1950 in Scotland that is.

I recommend this wonderful movie for any Grandparent today that is missing the old United States and having to settle for what we are getting today.  Being victims of Political Correctness has left us whining and huddled in fear of being jailed for having a viewpoint different from others.  I for one miss John Wayne.  There I have said it.  I'm in need of a hero again.  He never played the bad guy because he wanted us to have a hero.  The Cowboys was my favorite John Wayne movie.  I'm a sucker for honor.

Please, get this movie and tell me you don't see parallels to our country today.  There is no cursing, violence or sex but, you will not be bored.  You might even find yourself toasting the Scottish and then saying a prayer for our youth that they may find a way to bring the pride back to the good 'Ole U.S.A.'.....",1382659200,,1425,4.230483271375465

3873367,3,B0028RABS4,"This movie has suddenly become very topical, because it is beginning to look as if Scotland might separate from England.  The movie takes us back to a time when Scottish Nationalism was little more than a student movement; the ""kidnapping"" of the Stone of Destiny was a stunt to bring the movement to the notice of the media.

My sister and I were Glasgow University students in the 1950s around the time of the Stone incident.  Although the movie takes us back to those exciting days, it is spoilt by anachronisms including the clothes worn by students.  In reality, male students went around in suits and ties, plus woollen pullovers, and they looked very overdressed by today's standard. Female students also dressed conservatively and wore skirts, not pants.  The moviemakers did not copy the typical student dress, although they did take the trouble to show the small, low-performance cars of the period.

Getting back to politics and economics. Scotland in the 1950s was very unlike today's Scotland.  Then, unemployment was in the 2-3% range and any new graduate could expect a job, usually a choice of jobs.  Today Scotland (like the UK as a whole) is in the grip of a recession and youth unemployment is a major issue.

A final note; in the UK this DVD is priced at the equivalent of $120 on amazon.uk.  Is this because of overwhelming popular demand?",1327708800,9,1360,4.798283261802575

The scottish characters are endearing. I rooted for them. The Brits are mean. I hoped they would drown in some tea. The redheaded heroine was heartbreakingly beautiful. It is 1950.

8356715,5,B0028RABS4,"Well to start with, as usual this movie is not as good as the book ""Stone of Destiny"" by Ian Hamilton Q.C. which I highly recommend.  This film is based on the true story of the theft of the Stone of Scone on Christmas Day in 1950.  Besides being of historical importance this is also a great story of the spirit of youth and freedom.  The cinematography in this film is very nice and the scenery is great.  Acting is also very good in this film, overall a delight and recommended.",1517702400,,481,4.252747252747253
8356716,5,B0028RABS4,"A nation longs for its sovereignty, hope, self respect, and identity. The stone represents all that plus their freedom, and the fact that it sits under the throne of another country represents their subjugation by that country. When the symbol is brought back home,  Scotland rejoices, and their hearts are lifted and gladdened. They have lost the shame of subjugation, and can again look  themselves in the eye when they look in the mirror.

Powerful metaphor for America this last decade, and how Trump is giving people back an American identity of hope, independence, self respect.

This movie is well done: good premise, script, acting,  music, direction, cinematography, likable characters.",1517616000,3,695,5.281818181818182
8356717,5,B0028RABS4,"Not only is this a beautiful film, the characters are so darn likable that spending an evening at the pub with them sounds absolutely grand. Most of all, I'd lift a glass to the human spirit exemplified here; a people so proud of their heritage and their country that they'd risk everything to honor it. Bravo, Scotland!",1516838400,3,320,4.631578947368421
