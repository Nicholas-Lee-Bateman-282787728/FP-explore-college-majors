2018954,4,B0001MZ818,"This is a fun cheap movie. The very well done for Monogram who also brought us the Charlie Chan collection. I saw the alpha video version on DVD. It was in black and white and very grainy. But once you get into the story you will not notice this. It is also good enough for a repeat watching.

This movie has their favorite formula and old wealthy lady just barely won a court room trial in which her family tried to put her away as mentally unstable. After this she invites all of her family to visit the mansion at 12 midnight. Those that will not come will not inherit her fortune. Those that do come may die!

This movie has all of the standard mysterious characters all of them could be victims and any of them could be the murderer. There are secret passages and comic relief. It may not be the best entertainment in the world but is surely not one to be missed.

The film begins with news of the Denham Sanity Trial. A famous columnist, Bob White, attends. Aunt Cassie's relatives want to put her away so they can get her money. Three alienists observe Miss Denham. The lawyer asks about a gift to a neighbor, and her apple pie. The suit is dismissed. Next week Lawyer Denham tell columnist White about an invitation to Miss Denham's mansion at midnight. The relatives are all there when the clock strikes midnight. Cassie's wealth is all kept in the house, hidden away. Is there a secret passage in the library? Reporter White goes to the estate for the inquiry. Mr. Montrose tells what he saw at 11pm. White packs a revolver in his luggage. Then another relative is found dead in the library!

The Sheriff checks everyone's alibi. Afterwards this body also disappears! Just like in a movie. The missing bodies fall out of the closet into White's room! A large console radio brings in the news. Cassie has a metal box with two-hundred $10,000 banknotes and a million in securities. Another man is stabbed in the garden! White talks to Aunt Cassie alone, she has a plan to expose the murderer. [Is this sane?] Will it work? There is a surprise at the end. Photographer Eddie gets his money, but won't spend it.

This story is typical of the murder mysteries of that era. Is this an updated version of ""The Cat and the Canary""?",1263859200,,1396,4.6437246963562755
2018956,2,B0001MZ818,"The young `uns try to convince the court that Aunt Cassie (Sarah Padden) is mentally incompetent so they can get their greedy paws on her $3 million.  They fail, and Aunt Cassie invites them to her estate so that she can ""study them like rats"" and see who deserves to inherit her fortune.
 They get there, promptly at midnight, and soon begin dropping like ten pins.
 MURDER BY INVITATION is NOT a neglected gem.  It's a so-so quickie ripoff of THE CAT AND THE CANARY, which preceded this one by a couple of years and provided Bob Hope with his breakthrough movie, although instead of Hope and Paulette Goddard this one stars Wallace Ford and Marian Marsh.
 Ford plays a columnist who somehow rates a walking secretary and a photographer.  The movie is filled with sliding cabinets and bookcases set on lazy susans and dead bodies falling out of closets.  None of it makes much sense, but the cast seems to be having a good time and it's all over in a little over an hour.  And it comes as quite a surprise when we learn who's been killing everybody.  Not because of a neat plot twist, but because the movie doesn't bother developing our suspicion in any of the characters.
 MURDER BY INVITATION is fun in spots, but it's best to keep your expectations really really low.",1085529600,9,1271,4.535087719298246

8015146,3,B0001MZ818,"We love to watch oldies, and the kids like the creepy old house mysteries with some humor, aka, ""Cat and the Canary"".  This is a weak version of that, and they even mention that Bob Hope thriller early on in this one.

Rich Aunt is taken to court by scheming relatives wanting to grab her money by having her committed.  No go.  She invites(forces or be out of the will) them back to her mansion, infested with secret passageways, and a murderer,whom everyone thinks is the aunt.  There's a few funny parts especially with the spunky aunt, but otherwise, the humor often misses, the mystery lacks any development other than the quests are getting knocked off, and the sets and the overall quality of the film can't stand even in the shadows of the earlier ""Cat and the Canary.""

In other words, it's tolerable  but overall a bit boring.",1496016000,,836,4.570469798657718
8015147,5,B0001MZ818,"Great old b&w mystery from classic golden era.  Aunt Cassie's money-grubbing relatives are anxious to have her declared incompetent so that they can get their hands on her fortune.  After being declared competent, she invites the relatives to her spooky old mansion and the murders begin.  A funny, entertaining film. Fun to rewatch.",1487462400,,333,5.245283018867925
8015148,4,B0001MZ818,"I really love the old black & white mysteries where the story is confined within a mansion with, of course, lots of potential suspects (and victims!).  Sarah Padden as a very eccentric millionairess is an absolute hoot of a character!  The plot surrounds her gathering her potential heirs at her country mansion to determine who is worthy of an inheritance, and naturally, murders follow.  Like many films from this era, the audio and video are not exactly pristine but this is still quite watchable and a lot of fun.",1476489600,3,517,4.786516853932584

8015151,5,B0001MZ818,"This typical murder mystery is elevated by Sarah Padden's performance as Aunt Cassandra Hildegarde Denham, an elderly woman her few remaining relatives try to have committed so they can steal her money.  But Aunt Cassie is too sly for them and the case against her is easily dismissed.  ""I'm the only sane person in a family of nitwits!""  To show there are no hard feelings, she invites the stinkers to her house where an unseen assailant starts picking them off with plenty of malice aforethought.  The remaining relatives are quick to blame the old gal but Sheriff Boggs (George Guhl) and a pushy reporter (Wallace Ford as Bob White) think otherwise.  After all, the old lady could hardly keep shifting the bodies around, hiding them here and there, even with the aid of some secret passages.  But will they catch the culprit before everyone turns up dead?

Actress Sarah Padden is a marvel as the supposedly frail and mentally incompetent old lady.  She delivers all her lines with a no nonsense voice, punctuating her comments with a crazy laugh that's oddly endearing.  I thought she was hilarious and greatly helped this run of the mill story.  I thoroughly enjoyed her antics and practical solution to the problem at hand.",1432339200,6,1229,4.837320574162679
8015152,4,B0001MZ818,"This was pretty good. Story is greedy relatives after old rich relatives money, they all come to her house. The thing that doesn't make sense to me is when a detective or cop is needed, who do they call.  A newspaper man. Just go with it. Secret passages, spooky moments, and quirky people and a solid twist at the end. It is pure B movie.",1407024000,3,339,4.2153846153846155
8015153,4,B0001MZ818,"Overall, this film is very watchable.  While Alpha's transfer suffers slightly at least it is basically splice-free with no dialogue splices.  The most disappointing aspect is the fact that this is a Monarch re-issue.  They have replaced the beginning and end title card.  The most serious offense is that the beginning title card replacement gives you the title, but the star's name(Wallace Ford) is ommitted from the titles.  This is most egregious because there is video with the titles which is interrupted by this.",1373241600,,519,5.130952380952381
