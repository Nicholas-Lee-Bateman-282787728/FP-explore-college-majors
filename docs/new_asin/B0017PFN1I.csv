8266825,3,B0017PFN1I,"There are real dangers out there for archeologist. However this video could do a better job I think of telling their tales. Also, it doesn't seem to be very long. Worth watching... once, but don't expect a thrilling or suspenseful viewing. It would definitely be worth viewing for anyone seriously considering going into field work to provide some sobering and thoughtful examples, and to level-set expectations.",1497398400,,412,5.257575757575758

8266830,4,B0017PFN1I,"This video is actually very interesting.  It covers a variety of archaeological dig adventures with a minimum of hype.  The title is probably the most exciting part of the movie, but the information shared is valuable.  I recommend it for ages 13 and up; it is not really for children.",1340755200,2,285,4.66
8266831,4,B0017PFN1I,"As always real life isn't anywhere as exciting as Hollywood depictions.

Holywood is often continual action, it's designed to keep our attention for a couple of hours escapism.
The individuals portrayed here have often a few seconds to a few months intense action in what is often an otherwise rather ordinary life - basically just doing their jobs.

It isn't about Hollywood though - it's about real archeology, and as such it does rate 4 stars. It's not about sets, scenes or special effects, it's about the real life heroics of the archeologist, their history, their lives, their hardships and rewards.

The feature also touches on the archeologist adventurer, the archeologist spy and the archeologist theologian.

It's informative, it appears accurate, it seems to spell out the real life dangers of the profession.

As a byproduct there's several side paths in the show which shed light on some lesser known individuals from early history, from Indo China to the Andes.

If you have an interest in the subject, then at the price point its available it's certainly worth considering.

If its price ever got the wrong side of $15 I'd rate it only for the most serious addicts of the genere.",1330214400,,1194,4.91044776119403
