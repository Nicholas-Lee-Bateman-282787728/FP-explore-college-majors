8211110,5,B000TV4PYC,"This documentary is very good. I first bought it at the Smithsonian, when there was an exhibit at the Natural History Museum. I have bought it twice since then as it was ""borrowed"" by friends who then lent it to others. The music is great, first time I watched it, I did not realize how iconic lots of the tunes were, and why.  My reggae knowledge is much much improved now and it's only made me love this documentary even more. One of the best things is explanation of a Rasta point of view. I highly recommend this. Especially if you don't know anyone from this culture. Their wisdom is very applicable in this time. Anyway, that's all. Super good.",1521417600,,650,4.416666666666667

8211113,3,B000TV4PYC,I was expecting to purchase a video that was more in-dept in explaining the Rastafarian religion. This was not the result. I do not recommend this video if you want a full explanation of Rastafarianism.,1398816000,,202,4.8
8211114,1,B000TV4PYC,Not a soul mover for myself.but it might be what you need so don't knock it untill you try it.,1398556800,,94,3.75
8211115,4,B000TV4PYC,"I must admit I am new to the world of the Rastafarian.  I was looking for something a tad more comprehensive, and this DVD stops short.  Delivery was good. Explanations were provided by both academia, and Rastafarians.  I walked away with more knowledge about Rastafarians, but it may not be something I refer to in the future.",1373155200,3,327,4.701754385964913
8211116,5,B000TV4PYC,I highly recommend this! Get's right to the point! The sound and visual quality is superb! Should be required viewing in any World Religion class.,1346803200,,146,4.88
8211117,5,B000TV4PYC,"Amazon was great at getting my copy of coping with Babylon to me within 2 days, no other website I've used ever ships this fast. As for the DVD I really enjoyed it and saw it as being extremely educational and entertaining. I recommend this DVD to anyone wanting to learn more about the RasTafari lifestyle and beliefs or any current Rasta looking to expand their over standings.

8211118,4,B000TV4PYC,"Still a good knowledge base is presented . Good footage, even excellent subtitles. If Rasta is a subject of interest this can be a good thing . In this writers opinion, the information on some points is a bit out of date, however.",1295222400,5,230,4.372093023255814
8211119,5,B000TV4PYC,"I personally loved this documentary. For the first time we get to see a high quality documentary take us inside a Rasta Camp and interview the founder Dermot Fagan who is a great character.
A good all round view of Rastafari in the 21st century.
This film shows us that not all Rasta's have the same beliefs and not all believe that Haile Selassie is God or that repatriation means moving to Africa but for many it's a place in ones mind. The film helps to dismiss many of the rumours about Rastafari and speaks to important members of different houses of Rastafari.
Can reccomend....",1290124800,13,584,4.571428571428571
