8241915,4,B0011MOKY8,"I have been studying Japan leading up to, during, and the occupation period after WWII.  It largely consists of U.S. military unloading vehicles and cargo from ships and landing craft, setting up military offices and compounds here and there.  The most interesting aspect is seeing the reaction from Japanese citizens as troops began disembarking and unloading.  It was largely one of stunned passivity.  When marines got on trains in full uniform and field pack, Japanese citizens either stared at them unbelievingly or pretended not to notice.  It you're interested in Japanese history it's worth having in your library.  If you want an entertaining movie you'll be disappointed, not the least by the fact that most of the footage is silent except for an interesting audio commentary in the first section.",1256601600,,807,5.1692307692307695
