5124414,1,B00838HRP2,I wish I read the reviews before buying but I didn't think about looking at the reviews for a movie weve watched as kids. Guess I learned my lesson. I read the product description which does not mention it's a different region so it will not play in the states. We didn't know anything was off until my husband tried using the movie rewards code and was told he could not get them. And based off other reviews it looks like I can't even get a refund. I finally saw if you read through the features listing that it says it's a region 2 disk so it will not work in the states. But I wasn't going to looks at features when all I want is the movie. I don't care about any extra features. This is something that needs to be in the description or even the title. Total rip and I am not a happy customer.

I essentially paid allot of money to watch a DVD 5 times.

Son and his little friend, over for a play date and settled in for a movie time after exhausting every toy and game in the house.  Finally, they could sit back and be treated to a story full of wonder and be amazed at the lifelike characters, not to mention learn a basic and enduring life lesson in the bargain.  Not to mention that my wife and I were also looking forward to revisiting this magical story ourselves alongside our son and his friend.

We popped in the disc and sat back to enjoy the show...  Ad then...

""THIS DISC CANNOT BE PLAYED ON YOUR PLAYER""

We tried it on our other, newer Blu-Ray player and got the same message.

After scrambling to deal with the extreme disappointment from our two little audience members, I looked at the case for this movie -- sure enough it states this is the UK edition.

I know and accept there are different regions (still!) for electronic formats, which is fine.  My beef is with Amazon, for not CLEARLY STATING THIS IS THE U.K. VERSION...ESPECIALLY AT $63.42 PRICE POINT!!!

If they had stated that, they wouldn't have wasted my time and spared two impressionable little boys the disappointment of high expectations dashed.
