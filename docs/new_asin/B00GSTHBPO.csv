One such find is Lost Faces of the Bible. What ever your mind just conjured up? Forget it. The title is a tad misleading, but please forgive. They don't actually feature the lost faces of the Bible...but, that does not, in any way, diminish this wonderful documentary. See, it takes a lot to get any documentary made; and even more to sell that work pre-production - or post. Here, they went for a buzz word (Bible) and broadly weaved it into a dynamic look into skulls found in Bible areas in a remarkable time table.

The ancient skulls of four humans have been found; each episode is dedicated to a being. A very precise and technical team will reconstruct forensically, then model in clay and computer, to show what those skulls would have looked like - walking around the markets or sitting by Jesus' side as he shared his words of kindness.

And, the recreations, that take shape, are based on science - not arty guesswork.

Yet, that's not all the documentary shares. While scholars and artists work to reshape the skulls and recreate a face, the other sections interwoven in, take place within Bible tales; but other than Delilah, the regular people of the time. What these people could have meant in the Bible. There are four studies in the film.

Watching the mastery of how they take and use skull shape and ethnic features to mold a face upon the skulls is a genuine wonder. The production teams here really share every aspect of the building of these ancient faces; and give us visual transport back to see how each may have lived. The Bible tales just make it all more entertaining, if an hour of pure facial recreation isn't a fun-thrilled night in, in your book of entertaining to-do lists And, as the information is served up in several ala cart, yet themed, portions,.Lost Faces of the Bible a dynamic watch for an array of viewers; from science fiends, Bible study, anthropology, forensics, and historical bits. Get this and share an evening of mind blowing dedication to bringing these lost faces back into frame!",1396915200,4,2178,4.738786279683377
