7943563,5,B00005LC0F,"I have shown the film it at our Scandinavian Center at California Lutheran University and have referred to it in another presentation there. We also have the book by that title in our ScanCenter library. And I refer to it as well as the book and movie about ""O Pioneers!"" in discussions about author Willa Cather. In the film, of course, we can enjoy the beautiful music of the Lark. I appreciate Cather's references to the notable qualities of the Scandinavian immigrants, like two of my grandparents who first settled in her Nebraska. And Chicago of ""Song of the Lark"" had been home to the other two of my grandparents. As a journalist and writer of novels (see my novels on Kindle), I like her focused storytelling of a journalist, enriched by the beauty she conveys.",1362009600,,770,4.669117647058823

Thea Kronborg , a lovely and talented young Swedish American woman grows up as a gifted pianist.  Her life revolves around her interest in music and she knows she has to find a way to obtain lessons and leave her rural home in Colorado. Her life is music and she also has a lovely singing voice. Her parents help her to take piano  lessons and she herself earns money by teaching piano and also by  singing at funerals. She has a boyfriend, and her life seems full of hope for the future; however, she still doesn't see a way to get the formal advanced training that she needs.

When a tragedy happens in her life, she is bereft, but out of sadness, something good happens and she is able to leave home and take lessons with two wonderful music teachers.  Doors open for her in ways that she could never imagine, but in her personal life, she had some tough lessons to learn.

Alison Elliott plays Thea and an outstanding performance is given by Arliss Howard who plays Dr. Archie, a family doctor who serves as Thea's mentor.  This Masterpiece Theater production is based on a story by Willa Cather.",1241913600,,1182,4.439814814814815

This is a moving story of a number of people, especially a young woman who finds that her gift is singing.  Each of these main characters experience real heartache and Thea seems to feel for every one of them.  The acting is superb for all these characters.  The music is well chosen and plentiful.  The background music fits in well with the classical selections.  The music is light classical and not that different from orchestral movie music.

My one complaint is with the sleezy character.  He was played well.  Tony Goldwyn is a natural for such characters.  And I can believe that a naive country girl would fall for such a slick big town operator.  And it is in character and does her credit that when she finds out what he is, she immediately breaks it off.  The thorn in my side is that at the end, she says to him that there will never be another, even leaving open the possibility that she might get back together with him if he were ever free to marry.  This I found hard to believe and even more hard to take.

I was disappointed that she didn't eventually link up with the Doctor, who was by far the best partner for her.  But this would have been less realistic than the movie as a whole.

I have to take issue with one reviewer about the mimed singing.  Even filmed operas do not have the singers singing.  They dub it in afterward.  The few live performances filmed show the distortions that their faces have to go through to produce all that volume, and it interferes with the drama.

Those who like this movie will like ""Interrupted Melody (1955)"".  This is a true story of an Australian country girl who becomes a world famous opera singer, marries a doctor, and...well, see the movie.  You'll be glad you did.

Bottom line: If you like a good drama about real people, see this movie.",1161475200,10,1823,4.424698795180723
7943568,1,B00005LC0F,"Compared to other Willa Cather adaptations to film ""The Song of the Lark"" was a real disappointment.  The film was apparently done on a shoe string budget.  There were no actual views of Chicago, nor were there any views of the cliffs in Arizona.

The dubbing of Thea's voice was sloppy, and the movie just fizzled at the end.  We never get a chance to see Thea perform in big time opera.

The acting was only average; the actor playing Dr. Archie (Cowboy in ""Full Metal Jacket"") was embarrassing.

Other Cather adaptations, such as ""O Pioneers"" and ""My Antonia"" have been done so well, but this film is a waste of money.  Avoid it and buy the others.

Oh yeah, read the novel.  It is captivating.",1156636800,3,697,4.468253968253968
7943569,4,B00005LC0F,"I actually enjoyed this more than the book, which I find rather an aimless wander with somewhat one-dimensional characterization at times. I agree with the previous reviewer that Arliss Howard's portrayal of Dr. Archie is the film's best feature. Alison Elliott's Thea is great except for when she's supposed to be singing. Singing is a full upper-body exercise, and I am surprised the director did not instruct her to open her mouth and use her diaphragm. Since singing is a focal point of the film, this unrealistic portrayal IS a problem. Maximilian Schell was also wonderful as Herr Wunsch. I think what I think I enjoyed so much about this film is that -- in contrast to how Cather sometimes portrays these folks in the novel -- it seems to be peopled with figures from my own real life over the years. I could relate to it more than I could to the novel, which is rare.",1142640000,,875,4.579617834394904
7943570,4,B00005LC0F,"I reluctantly watched this last evening and am glad to report I was more

than than just pleasantly surprised.  It had that good old-fashioned

Masterpiece Theatre feel to it which I remember from when I watched more PBS

in my youth.  In fact watching this, in a very big way, returned me to my

youth, reminding me of my own innocent passions.  I can picture other kids

living in ""nowhereville"" watching this and sense their growing youthful

aspirations of achieving greatness and leaving those stifling towns for

Great Things.

As a highschool fan of Willa Cather - after being forced to read ""My

Antonia""  - it was nice to see such a fine treatment of this moving novel.

Allison Elliot's Thea is a strong young woman, as she would have to be in

the world which the film shows - mostly dominated by men.  In fact the film

has its own late romantic operatic touch in that Thea, a Swedish minister's

daughter, is the only central female character, and she fits into this

""men's world"" quite easily.

It is no small irony that the men in Moonstone with whom she identifies live

somewhat unhappy lives and dream of something more: her suitor, Ray who sees

that Thea is bound for great things which he cannot begin to understand and

who's death provides the opportunity for her to leave and begin her studies

in earnest; her piano teacher, Professor Wunsch, the once ""almost famous""

musician who drowns his tortured failings in the bottle; and most of all Dr.

Archie, who, hopelessly trapped in a loveless marriage with a ""sour"" wife

see's Thea as the possible vicarious escape in which dreams can be achieved.

There is also Mexican Johnny who teaches her the folk songs from his

homeland, which neighbors and even her own family find some disgrace in.

Though the film does not delve into race relations - in more than one scene

we are shown that those involved in the arts have the opportunity (if not

always the inclination) to rise above racism and sexism.

Though Thea faces some hardships they are given that nice Masterpiece Theatr

e glow which doesn't necessarily diminish their importance, but rather

provides an opportunity to show growth and strength of character.

Director Karen Arthur had a few good tricks up her sleeve - our first image

of Thea is in work clothes on a hill, dusty, unkempt - an image she will see

herself in at the start of her new life when she visits the Art Institute of

Chicago and out of all the treasures there is drawn to Jules Breton's

painting ""The Song of the Lark.""  I don't know if it's my bad eyes or if a

certain technique was being used, but at key moments - the turn of a head, a

look out the window, a glance towards the audience - the film speed seemed

to alter, slowing down almost to the quality of a nickelodeon picture, which

given the time period of the story was another perfect touch.

Lori Stinson provides the voice of the character and we hear the raw beauty

of it in some old Swedish hymns, some Mexican folk songs as it blossoms into

youthful maturity in Che faro senza Euridice, Let the Bright Seraphim, a

Queen of the Night aria, among other things.  Marilyn Horne is credited as

the vocal coach.

While I found all of the actors uniformly top quality, the performance that

moved me the most was Arliss Howard as Dr. Archie.  As played by Howard,

here is a man who could easily be tortured by his life's circumstances, but

remains a gentleman, through strength of purpose is able to maintain both

his dignity perspective.  Howard's range of confined respectable emotions

vasilate between what must remain a secret tortured love for Thea, a

parental tenderness, and the true love and respect of a friend.  At her

debut in Chicago, it is Dr. Archie that leads the ovation - the years of joy

and pain now register in his face through pride.  It is not just Thea's

debut, it is, in a way, his triumph.  The film's penultimate scene is his as

bidding Thea farewell, most likely forever, he fights back his tears and

with voice choked tells her ""You were three, the first time I saw that

little blonde head of yours ... I couldn't imagine all the wonder, all the

wonders it contained.  There is so little that is truly fine in this world

... Life would have been a pretty bleak stretch for me, if you were left

out.""

Bravo to Masterpiece Theatre on this fine innaugaral effort of its American

Collection.",1125964800,22,4412,4.554417413572343
7943571,5,B00005LC0F,"I loved this presentation on Masterpiece.  I'd never read the book, or really given Willa Cather's works a lot of thought until I saw this movie.  The story is beautiful, a young woman who has an amazing talent, as many of us do, yet still seeks to find herself, as also many of us do.  Alison Elliot does a magnificent job, I'd love to see her in more Masterpiece Works.  (She also starred in The Buccaneers)",1014163200,3,409,4.342105263157895
