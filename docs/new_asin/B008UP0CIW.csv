5183491,3,B008UP0CIW,"This movie was OK. Not too bad and not that great. Rec 1 and 2 were definately better. This movie differs from the previous 2 in a couple ways. First and foremost, its not a 100% ""Found Footage""  or ""POV"" movie. Only the first 15-20 minutes or so are from the point of view of the character with the video camera filming the wedding. After the video camera gets broken, the film then goes directly into a regularly filmed movie. So a lot of people may like that aspect of it since there are always a large amount of people that complain how much they hate found footage movies because of the over abundance of that particular genre in todays movie market. So those people will be glad that there won't be alot of shakey camera movements and dark blurry shots and stuff like that after the first act of the movie. The second way this movie differs from the first two films is that is has had some humor injected into the second and third acts of the movie. So the flavor of this movie is much different than the others. Its not as scarey and serious. Its more on the campy side. But its worth a look, but its not one that i'd personally would watch more than once.",1353196800,2,1163,4.262443438914027
5183492,3,B008UP0CIW,"Fans of the REC series love each and every movie that's been released and with good cause. What could have been a simple zombie story has added touches of mystery that make you wonder just what causes these events and how far they might spread. The original film was a masterpiece of claustrophobia where a supposed virus may have infected those inside an apartment building whose inhabitants are forced to ride out the attacks of the night with no hope of escape.

The latest entry into this series takes a different approach. The film opens with a wedding and reception. Clara and Nina are a couple in love and both their families represent quite a large gathering. Included in this group is Nina's uncle. His uncle is a veterinarian whose hand is wrapped that day due to a dog bite. This simple bite will change the entire day.

The usual festivities go on and everyone is dancing and singing when they suddenly notice this uncle balancing on the balcony with a strange look on his face. He falls and the first person to respond he reaches up and bites, pulling away flesh and frothing at the mouth. From there things progress with the discovery that he's infected others there and those who are infected begin attacking those who are not. Soon blood sprays and bites become frequent, Clara and Nina become separated and each group they are with attempts to find a way to survive.

These zombies are not the standard slow moving sort but the run as fast as you can and grab anything moving kind. And each person who falls then gets up to join the carnage. With no hope of anyone coming to their rescue, Nina tells those in his group he refuses to leave until he finds Clara. He says they have a connection and he knows she's still alive. When her voice comes over the PA system his statement is proven true and he now heads out to find her.

The film offers something different from the previous entries. First off is the fact that while its contained in a huge reception hall and grounds, its no longer that enclosed feeling found in an apartment complex wrapped in plastic to contain the disease. The disease is loose on the world now. Secondly this one adds small touches of humor now and then to ease the fear you feel while watching. One character walks around in a foam knock off brand Spongebob outfit (he was there to entertain the children) with a shotgun in his hand. Nina dons a suit of armor found in the chapel to protect himself while searching for Clara. Touches like these shuffle the emotions felt while watching.

The film should keep gore hounds happy with the amount of blood that splatters and shoots across the screen. Limbs are severed, guts are yanked out and bites offer up plenty of chewed flesh that spurts plenty of fluid.

Some people have criticized the film for straying away from familiar territory. One criticism has been that the priest in the film stops the zombies from moving about by reading Biblical passages. Those who know the cause of this plague will understand, those who thought it was simply a virus will not. Suffice to say that it is possible in the world this story takes place in that that would help.

Another thing that upset some fans was the change of locale, the difference between the confined space and this spacious reception hall and grounds. But that only makes sense when you consider the subject at hand, the spread of a disease of sorts that will infect the world. Eventually you must leave that confined space and move on. REC 3 does just that, taking the disease outside of that small space and moving it forward. Should another sequel come up my guess is it will be spread even further, infecting an entire city rather than a small space. It's the natural progression of things.

If you like zombie films, you'll love this. If you like the REC films, you should love this. If you love horror movies or gore films this one should be right up your alley. If you enjoy none of the above be prepared for something different than you normally watch. A solid foreign horror film that hits all the right notes.",1352764800,4,4072,4.560875512995896
5183493,5,B008UP0CIW,I admit I was wrong. A month or so ago I had written in the Amazon review forumn that this video would probably not make it to actual DVD release until 2013. I am happy it actually did. For the failrly inexpensive cost it is worth the cheap 20 dollar price tag.,1352419200,,261,4.038461538461538
5183494,5,B008UP0CIW,"I love [REC] and [REC 2]. They are some of my favorite horror films and im very loyal to them as a fan. I came into [REC 3] Genesis with an open mind and absolutely loved every bit of it. I loved the gore, the horror, the soundtrack, the dark humor and the 20 minutes of found footage they placed at the beginning of the film. I thought overall the film was superbly crafted.

As a film Paco Plaza did all on his own I would say he did fantastic! I thought it was perfectly appropriate to be diffenrent and add humor and a traditional filming technique to the franchise. It adds depth and change and a breath of fresh air for a series that already did a found footage take 2 times before.

I can't believe all the poor ratings for this film. A 5.2 out of 10 on IMDB.com and only 39% out of 100% percent on Rotten Tomatoes. In my opinion this film is highly underrated. Come on audiences and critics...stop hatin. I loved it!

If your looking for a good film, with zombies, laughs, fun, gore and a good plot with a fun storyline [REC 3] Genesis is most definetally for you! And if you loved [REC] and [REC 2] you should enjoy [REC 3] Genesis. Check it out!

Be sure to look out for [REC 4] Apocalypse directed by Jaume Balaguero which will be the last film and final chapter into the [REC] series.",1352246400,2,1296,4.192771084337349
5183495,1,B008UP0CIW,"The first two movies were extremely good, this one is just the opposite of that. Its a less than mediocre story, slightly ok actors and that's about it really. The only good thing about it is the artwork. Skip this one and replace it with quarantine 2 next to you rec 1 and 2 dvds. Just look at quarantine 2 as rec3 the ""virus"" moved to america.",1352073600,,345,4.164179104477612
5183496,3,B008UP0CIW,"Those expecting the same seriousness as REC 1 an 2 with part 3 might be displeased with this film. The director takes part 3 and moves it away from the apartment complex of the first two films to a lavish wedding with tons of guests. He also uses a lot less shaky camera and adds in a comedic twist that sets ""REC 3"" apart from the others. It still follows the whole possessed by demons theme which I don't mind but feels like a whole different movie from the others, more like an add on rather than a sequel as it has no ties to the other films aside from demon possessed people.

So the wedding is disrupted by an uncle who was bitten by a dog that was possessed. That sets the whole wedding into chaos as more and more of the wedding party become demons out for blood. It also sets the bride and groom apart and in search of each other all the way to the very end. Its they're search for each other that made me like the movie, the journey to make it back to the person you love through a chaotic event. When they finally get to that moment though you feel a little cheated from how the last events of the film play out.

I like and dislike ""REC 3"" at the same time and feel that the comedy adds but also takes away from the film. Its biggest downfall for me is the fact that it has no ties to the other films and a kind of crappy ending that leaves no room for a sequel. With that being said it was a fun experience with gore an some great kills but I only enjoyed that to an extent. For everything good with ""REC 3"" there's something bad so don't expect to sit there and be blown away. Take it as a fun but flawed gore filled ride with demon possessed people out to ruin one pissed off brides wedding, not to serious a film but not that funny either.",1350777600,5,1755,4.040229885057471

5183501,2,B008UP0CIW,"I originally didn't have any plans on watching this movie, but tonight I figured eh, why not? and sat through it. The reason I wasn't interested was because I had watched the first two [REC] movies, and loved them. When I heard that the third installment kind of did its own thing and didn't follow the story we had gotten so deep into, that killed it for me. But a few months ago, I got to watch [REC] 4, which is supposed to conclude the story, and while it was ok for a horror movie, it was still disappointing to see that so much of the religious plot had been scrapped for no reason. This led me to give [REC]3: Genesis a go, wondering how it would do. Long story short, this is easily the worst in the series and has zero memorable moments. Likenone at all. I can think of terrible horror movies Ive seen like Texas Chainsaw 3D or any of the Saw sequels, and come up with at least ONE thing I liked. Here? Nada. Its a throwaway movie that is unfortunately well-made.

We start out on a wedding day for two happy young people, Clara and Koldo. Koldos cousin, Adrian, is recording everything with his handheld camcorder, and he meets the real cameraman, Atun in the process. Atun gives him some pointers, telling him to try and get some magical things that most wouldnt notice, hinting that they could combine footage and make a really special wedding dvd. Its not long before the wedding that we see Koldos uncle with a bandage on his hand, covering a nasty bite from a dog that he thought was dead. Sound familiar? The wedding goes on, everyones happy, the couple is happy, but at the party, things take a turn for the worse when, you guessed it, Koldos uncle falls from the second floor, onto the dance floor, gets up, and bites chunk out of a womans neck, then starts to attack others. Minutes later, several other people burst through the projector screen and attack everyone else. Koldo and Clara get separated, with Clara being left in the care of the priest and Koldo left with a couple of people, including Adrian, Claras sister, Atun and a man who came to the wedding just to see what songs were used so he could collect the royalties. With so many people at the wedding, and the team locked in the kitchen, this is gonna be a tough one to get out of.

While there was nothing memorable about this movie, there were still some things it did ok. The first being that they drop the found footage gimmick after the first 22 minutes (which, oddly, is when the title of the movie finally appears on-screen). Koldo, not happy with Atun filming the bloodbath that just occurred, destroys his camera. Once the camera is destroyed, the movie is filmed like any normal movie, with multiple angles, etc. I was glad that this happened, and they completely abandon the found footage bit in the final [REC] movie, so this was a step in the right direction for the series. I was also happy to see that the infected (Im really sick of that overused term, aren't you?) respond to holy water and Biblical passages like they did in the previous films.

Unfortunately, everything else is mediocre at best. Apart from Clara, who I only really cared for because this was her wedding day and because she was so freakin stunningly beautiful, I didn't care about any other characters here, with the slight exception of a childrens entertainer who is a knockoff of SpongeBob. Even Claras little sister was only shown when she was crying or worried about what was going on, and shes never used again. With this being filmed like a normal movie, they had plenty of chances to do something with her or use her more to get the viewer even a little emotionally attached. Nope! Shes of the same importance as Extra #15. They also went the obvious route with setting things up while Adrian is filming everyone before the wedding, showing a strange woman just standing still in the distance, and Koldos uncle saying that hes going to give him something later on. [REC] 3 also has comical moments that kill what couldve been decent tension. Koldo and another guy suiting up in armor they find in the church, complete with a sword and mace, isn't that funny at first, but when its shown how ineffective it is, theres a Bugs Bunny-esque moment that makes you wonder what they were going for. Even worse is the gore. Where in the last two movies, you got a good amount and with it being found footage, you only saw so much, but it was enough. Here, the kills are fast and so unsatisfying. See the chainsaw in the movies poster? Yeah, don't expect anything cool out of that, especially when it goes through people like a knife, doesnt splatter blood, and has the ability to split people in half vertically when it goes from the stomach to the chest, never going near the head.

All of that is just the tip of the iceberg. The worst thing for me was how selective the virus is. Theres one point in the movie where its very obvious that Koldo is getting blood from an infected person in his mouth. He ends up being totally fine and isn't even concerned about it. While were at it, Koldo is a pretty lame character with the personality of a koala.

It may not be the worst movie Ive seen this year, yet [REC] 3 is going to be the one that I forget about in no time. This is one of those horror movies that will only get reactions out of young kids who haven't seen much in movies or online. This one adds NOTHING to the series in any way, and you can skip it altogether, moving on from the second one to the fourth without any problems. You know, its weird how its like Halloween 3: Season of the Witch in that way! The difference being that Halloween 3 is actually a fun movie if you can accept it for being different, when they wanted the series to be a bunch of different things that happen on Halloween night.",1445990400,,5785,4.423076923076923

5183516,4,B008UP0CIW,"I put off getting this one because I'm such a huge fan of the first 2 and had read that this was a departure in tone and format. I am glad I waited but also that I finally checked it out. Really quite good. I SO admire the amount of time spent establishing just how in love the bride and groom are. Some of THE most believable wedding day chemistry I've ever seen between two actors. I LOVE the creepy, slowly unfolding ""wrongness"" in the background prior to the full-blown explosion (I'm assuming some of the initial assailants came from outside the wedding, the first infected guest couldn't have bitten that many other guests). I love the little connection to the first (and 2nd) film involving the uncle. I also LOVE that the abrupt change in format from POV to regular film narrative comes when one character restates the argument FOR the POV as presented in the first 2 films and someone else ""tells"" him just how WRONG that is! Awesome! The revised format requires a step up in the realism of the gore (no problem there). It also provides opportunities not wasted by the filmmakers. There are a few slightly distracting inconsistencies. For example; why is it the infected slowly shuffle and stumble about the place like NOTLD ghouls until they are required to execute fantastic parkour leaps from rooftops and balconies in the background? (also, these infected don't seem capable of the bursts of frenzied speed seen in the first two films. Because this isn't as scary when it isn't on POV video? Maybe.) Why are all the reflections wearing dirty knickers, other than as a visual callback to Rec1 and Rec2? And it's distracting that so many characters end up with copious amounts of infected blood flying into their mouths and yet they still need to be bitten in order to be infected, die and change. There are some WONDERFUL little plot devices which link to bits of dialogue from the first part of the film (the climactic one is astoundingly well-done.) however, the best things about this are the well-pitched moments of laughter in the midst of personal despair and wholesale apocalyptic carnage (and how well-constructed the narrative ups and downs, tension/breather/release/tension are) and the INCREDIBLY controversial views of how people change and how they remain the same in a crisis such as this. I can't think of many directors or actors who could pull off some of the extremely ""iffy"" intimate moments on display in the final third of this film. I didn't feel this one hit me as deeply as the first two Rec's, but, it's a logical progression in style and a gamble that truly pays off because there's such solid emotion at the core.

5183517,2,B008UP0CIW,"I enjoyed the first REC movie OK.  It was decent for what it was - a low budget zombie movie.  I feel the same way about REC3.

REC3 isn't a long movie, weighing in at under 90 minutes.  However, it's a movie that likes to take its time.  We get way too much unnecessary exposition before the first zombie arrives at the wedding reception, and my wife and I found ourselves looking at our watches and wondering when the plot was going to get started.  Indeed, one might characterize the pace of REC3 as languid.

The bride Clara reacts to the proceedings exactly as you might expect a young woman to react who's dreamed of her wedding for years.  She and her groom Koldo do a variety of stupid things and they make it only because it's in the script.

There are some fun moments and bits of comedy in here.  However, this isn't even close to my first choice for a zombie film.  If you are into this kind of thing, it's OK, but you can find better.",1391644800,,947,4.23463687150838

5183524,5,B008UP0CIW,"I love this movie. It's tragic, it even brings out a few tears. It's comedic, and very self-referential at times - I was laughing several times because I understood the references.

Before you jump on me, please read the entire review and see what I have to say first.

Yes, it is true that despite the name being REC, the recording symbol, representing a first-person in-universe account of the events that follow, it only starts that way. Actually, it starts out that way and gradually moves away from it - first Koldo breaks the camera, then it briefly cuts back into the format a few times right after. After a certain point, though, it's gone for good.

I saw this movie by myself at first, and yes, it is actually a great movie. It's not only a clever subversion of the found footage tropes (come on, a wedding? That place is BRIMMING with cameras, no excuse not to use 'em - in fact it would make for a more-likely setup than the second movie), it's also very self-aware in that regard. It knowingly sheds the in-universe perspective while fully aware that was how the story had been told previously.

The movie boots-up as an unfinished wedding DVD. This justifies the changing camera angles in the first-person POV part of the movie, and makes anyone previously unaware of the movie think the whole movie will be that way.

The movie's progression is semi-predictable. You might think you know where it's going, but how it gets there, you'll never know. And it may even surprise you with where it does go.

I watched this again with my sister and her fianc and they really liked it. I found I loved the movie a lot more when I saw it with them. My sister especially loved it. It appealed to them especially for its wedding setting.

Then again, I am the Trekkie who thinks The Final Frontier is the best of the original Star Trek movies, when that one is usually the disaster compared to the other five. Napoleon Dynamite is also my favorite movie of all time. You definitely have to have the right mindset for these kinds of movies; it helps to know what they are in advance before you decide to watch them, so you can lower your expectations to a level they might more easily attain, or at least to let them grow on you and appreciate them for what they are rather than wish they were something else.

In this case, it's not a classic movie, but it's a great movie, in my book. Knowing it got rid of the overt horror elements and first-person perspective - all the things that made the first two movies so terrifying - helps to focus on the emotional aspects of the characters more, which is all but perfect for this particular setting.

And for those of you miffed that REC 3: Genesis is not ""found footage"" - what a tired and clich term (that's why I prefer to call it ""in-universe perspective"") - get used to it; REC 4: Apocalypse will have NO such perspective in it. The good news is it will be straight-up horror again. That, at least, should be somewhat comforting.

And if it's any more of a comfort to you, there will be no REC 5. I'm sure of that.",1371513600,,3067,4.431616341030195

I have been hypothesizing all along that [REC] franchise ""co-directors"" Jaume Balagero and Paco Plaza are no such thing, and that Plaza has been doing all the heavy lifting here. (I refuse to believe that the guy who spewed out the horrible Darkness had anything to do with these movies.) We move closer to that hypothesis being conclusively proven or disproven; Plaza and Balaguero parted ways for the final two movies in the series, with Plaza directing Gnesis and Balaguero helming the forthcoming Apocalipsis. And while Gnesis doesn't live up to the first two films, with a couple of exceptions, Plaza has given us a pretty darn good horror-comedy here.

Plot: it's Clara (Man Push Cart's Leticia Dolera) and Koldo (Paper Birds' Diego Martn)'s wedding day. Which, unfortunately, happens to be the day the first [REC] film takes place; Plaza establishes the film's timeline early on (Koldo is talking to his uncle, who's Patient Zero for this movie, and the uncle is nursing a wound on his hand; he mentions he was bitten by a very strange dog. This is, of course, the dog mentioned in the first film who was taken to the vet before the movie started, and who is the actual ""patient zero"" for the entire series). The wedding takes place, blah blah blah, we get to the reception, and said uncle, after taking a swan-dive onto a buffet table, reanimates and chows down on another guest just as two other zombies, who we saw on the fringes in earlier shots, come barrelling through the screen showing the formerly-happy couple's photo slideshow and proceeding to massacre most of the guests. Clara and Koldo are separated; Koldo finds himself part of a group containing a music-industry spy, his teenaged niece, and one of his friends, while Clara teams up with Koldo's best bud, an old friend of hers from France with whom said best bud had hooked up during the reception, and Spongejohn, an entertainer hired to keep the kiddies occupied while the adults were drinking and dancing. The two groups attempt to survive the attack in different ways, while Clara and Koldo, each unaware the other is still alive save at certain points, try to find their way back to one another.

There are a few places where the movie gets downright ridiculous. Even if you go into it expecting a stupid horror-comedy (and most people didn't, at least if they'd seen the first two movies), there are still places where it's so over the top that you can't help but roll your eyes and groan. It's possible to do over-the-top well; my mother, who never liked horror movies, watched the original Dawn of the Dead with me at least half a dozen times, and she once posited that the reason she could watch that but could never stomach, say, The Exorcist was because the gore was so campy you just knew it wasn't real. But it's undeniable that Dawn of the Dead is an effective, and very successful, horror film that contains comedy elements. (The scene with the biker and the blood-pressure machine is, for my money, one of the single funniest moments in horror-film history.) This can't tell at times whether it's a horror film or a stupid comedy, and it suffers for that.

On the other hand, the climax of the film--about which I obviously can't say anything without being spoilery--still manages to be affecting, affirming, and oddly uplifting, so I can't really call the movie a failure; it gets there by a very twisted path (there are a few scenes that I would swear were lifted straight out of Quarantine 2, the godawful DTV sequel to the American remake of [REC]...which I can't believe Paco Plaza actually sat down and watched), but it does get there. I'm not quite sure how, but it does. Is Gnesis a good movie? Not really. But it's a fun movie, and stupidly watchable, and if you ignore the movie's one massive series plothole (which you won't even notice if you haven't seen the first movie--it was obviously tossed in to pacify series fans...and it's ended up having the opposite effect) and just go with the dumb, you'll have a good time with it. ** ",1367971200,,4071,4.712078651685394

The first two ""Rec"" movies were exceptionally good (the first being the basis for ""Quarantine""). I wasn't sure what to expect with this third entry, but I was pleasantly surprised! It started off as the usual ""POV"" film, but then progressed to a dark horror comedy a-la ""Shaun of the Dead."" This entry added some supernatural elements, a break from the premise of the first two. A great zombie film, very entertaining.

5183529,5,B008UP0CIW,"I am a fan of most zombie movies dating back to the 80's. I hold high standards to any movie that claims to be a zombie movie, and this movie (REC3) is no exception. I held it to high standards and I like to believe that it measured up to my expectations and standards. As some have already stated in previous reviews, I agree that it does stand alone from the previous 2 prequels. So if you haven't seen either 1 or 2, don't worry this one plays out independently. First off lets point out the obvious- this is a movie made in Spain and therefore filmed in Spanish. Do you need to know spanish to enjoy this movie ? Absolutely not. In fact most of the script and plot is carried out with action, blood, guns, chainsaws, and religious artifacts. Second this movie is entirely different from the previous 2, in that it is NOT filmed by a handheld POV camera man in the movie. The first 15 minutes does get carried out by a POV camera man but after that it switches over to a normal director. This is perhaps good because Im not a fan of shaky and chaotic swinging camera angles. I can not tell you what happens in the end but I can tell you that it was a complete suprise to me and the way the director decided to end the movie was with a new twist. Now, having said that, let me warn you something about genre in this film. You may not believe this and you may not like this either. While this movie is regarded as a spanish horror type it does combine several elements of romance and spiritual. What is unique about this is that these elements of romance and religion are interwoven so carefully and lightly into the plot that you barely notice it. However romance and religion remain among the prime elements of this story, but you are not aware of this until the movie ends. Thereby putting a whole new fresh spin on the zombie genre arena. I loved this movie and I think you will too almost to the point that you will want to add it to your zombie movie collection. It is also a good movie to watch if you are withdrawing from the season finale of the Walking Dead like I am.",1367280000,2,2079,4.213032581453634
5183530,4,B008UP0CIW,"Director Paco Plaza takes his 'REC' franchise and decides to go for the over the top jugular in 'REC 3-GENESIS'-2012 , a combination of straight out horror and yuk yuk three stooges humor.  The action takes place at the wedding and reception of Clara and Koldo who's day starts off being lensed by the photographers but 30 minutes into the film, Director Plaza decides to film the action straight on discarding the jerky camera movements.  It seems the uncle in the family shows up with a bite wound from the same dog who infected the apartment complex in the first film which causes the foaming mouth mayhem to insue. In fact, their is a beautiful scene where our hero is in a control room filled with monitors showing different areas of the reception grounds. As he is watching the monitors, Plaza revolves the camera to a television attached to the ceiling and it flickers images of the girl reporter filming the fire department entering the quarantined apartment complex so this films action is in real time with the first film.  The infected victims are given great makeup effects and their are some really exciting jolts within the films 80 minute running time. Director Plaza succeeds in some very horrific set pieces, case in point, our heroine finds herself on the grounds by herself during a torrential rain storm.  The camera pans to a lone figure in the distance approaching her and through the pouring rain, she realizes it is her mother.  She reaches out for her as the camera closes in on the mothers mouth spewing blood and puss as she lunges forward. The denouement is both poignant and terrifying.  The performances by Leticia Dolera and Diego Martin as the wedded couple are outstanding  which makes the ending of the film both hysterical and tragic and could have ended no other way.  For some lovers of the first two films, you may be in for a let down for their is no continuation of the storyline left over from the second film but for this fan it was , as always from this franchise, a great roller coaster ride.  The film utilizes a 1.85 aspect ratio for its opening camcorder scenes and when that camera is shattered, it switches to 2.35 for the rest of its running time.  It is in its original Spanish language with English subtitles. Outtakes and deleted scenes are the only extras. There is a fourth in the works so lets hope that we get to see more questions answered in that one.

5183531,3,B008UP0CIW,"I've seen the first two installments in this series and the American counterpart to the first. I liked them a lot and looked forward to seeing this. It was a departure from the originals in style and, for my dollar, suffered for the change.

Here's the scoop. Koldo and Clara have just married. At the reception, an uncle who was bitten by dog infected by 'the terrible virus', turns zombie-fied and all mayhem ensues. Koldo and Clara are separated in said mayhem, but love will find a way and they need to find each other and a way out of the mess.

First off, they chose to drop the p.o.v. format of the original two. This is a shame because they use it in the early scenes and it's great. You get a real feel for the pre-wedding, wedding and early reception. You meet a lot of their friends and family and it feels like you're at home with your own family. It all seems so natural. When the you-know-what hits the fan they switch to more traditional filming techniques. That, in and of itself, is not bad, but the tone of things changes as well. The dark humor is more Raimi-esque and it seems way out of place. (Not to mention not as good as Raimi) There were also some really bad decisions. Too many off the kills were jump scares. I thought it was well agreed that that technique is near dead and needs to be used sparingly. And what is a chain saw doing with a pile of wood in a tunnel under the banquet hall? And why won't the chainsaw start at a crucial moment? How cheap is that?!

The filming, acting and such were generally good. Leticia Dolera is a doll as Clara. Even when she isn't 'at her best.' The problem came at both the conceptual and script level. With this fumble, I hope they put the series to rest. Dragging this on would be more painful than turning into one of the zombies.",1362528000,,1800,4.288235294117647
5183532,2,B008UP0CIW,"A kung fu kicking, chainsaw wielding, blood splattered bride screaming ""it's my day"" is my kind of bloody good fun. So, then why is it that the new entry in Spanish director Paco Plaza's soon to be never ending franchise fails to move me. I suppose to be honest and up front I never did really think all that much of his previous (REC) movies, nor the dull nearly shot for shot Quarantine American versions. The films have all been too deadly serious and derived of the kind of fun that makes a good scary movie. And yet, the lighter, sillier, and even reasonably more engaging (REC)3: Genesis still didn't move me.
 Starting off as a found footage document of the wedding of Koldo (Diego Martin) and Clara (Letica Dolero), for the first fifteen minutes we attend the various wedding day gatherings, toasts, drunk uncles, etc., until we are ready to check that we are in deed at the correct movie and not some projectionist's lame practical joke. Finally, the drunk uncle turns out to be a zombie and through the usual bite unleashes a zombie plague. The title card arrives informing us that we are in deed in the correct theater, after all,  providing that you are still awake.
 For the next hour the picture moves at a breakneck pace as Clara and Koldo are forced to dawn chainsaws and medieval knight's attire, don't ask, to face down their undead relatives. At a running time of just eighty minutes, once things get rolling they do indeed, thankfully, not let up.
 (REC)3: Genesis takes a lighter tone that it's grim predecessors, it's full of slapstick humor and strange quirky bits, like the children's entertainer dressed as a SpongeBob knock off, spongeJohn, of course. Think a wedding and four hundred funerals. The problem is, none of it is really all that funny, the humor draws the viewer out of the narrative, often it is badly forced, occasional just plain bizarre, and very rarely hits the mark.
 Of late the horror genre, so beloved by me and many others, has become tiresome and stale, it`s stuck in a rut that is worst than any I have ever seen. The very fact that the (REC) movies, and possibly even the Quarantine films, are seen at the forefront of the current movement illustrates the distressing point.
 The stars here are appealing, mostly Spanish actors that I am not familiar with, but a good talented lot. Dolero is very good in the lead role, she's beautiful and forceful, which helps the proceedings move at a more agreeable rapidity. Enhanced by thralling camera work from Pablo Rosso, who helmed the other (REC) flicks. The screenplay, credited to Plaza and Luiso Beredjo, from what I hope was meant to be an ironic credit for original idea by Plaza, Beredjo and David Gallart, is just plain awful, derivative of not only their earlier films, but countless others, it is also chocked full of hideously stupid dialogue, then again that could just be in the subtitling. Still, Clara nd Koldo refer to one another by ""my love"" so many times in the movie's short running time that a drinking game could be suicidal. The show all comes to the same kind of close that we have learned to expect from it's predecessors.
 (REC)3: Genesis unfortunately adds nothing new what so ever to the genre, for sure some are going to draw comparisons with the much better Shaun of the Dead, but I think that the inspiration lies in a slightly more obscure film from the early 1990's. My feeling is that it desperately wants to be a close cousin to Peter Jackson's truly magnificent New Zealand zom-com Dead Alive, but Plaza's movie winds up being merely brain dead.

5183533,4,B008UP0CIW,"I guess, in the face of a zombie apocalypse, there's no sane logic to justify why someone with average survival instincts would keep on recording with their handheld video camera. So maybe it makes sense that, a third into the film, the found footage conceit is dropped. So much for cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute;. Except it's this very conceit that made the [REC]films such a gripping watch. REC 3, in discarding it, forfeits a sizable chunk of that sense of debilitating confinement, of knuckle-biting claustrophobia.

3.5 out of 5 stars for [REC] 3: GENESIS. The premise can't help but lend an enhanced element of horror. As Clara and Koldo celebrate their happy union, the wedding ceremony and ensuing raucous reception are chronicled thru the video cameras of a professional wedding photographer and of Koldo's cousin. But maybe that oddly behaving uncle shouldn't have been invited. He sports a bandaged hand, claims he got bit by a dog. Uh-oh. When Koldo's cousin steps outside for some air, he glimpses a police car and some folks in hazmat suits. He dismisses what he sees. He's amused that the weird uncle is now puking nasty bile. It's almost here.

[REC] 3 is, technically, a well-executed Spanish horror film, with English sub-titles available as an option. Paco Plaza, who co-directed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rec/dp/B002HXR542/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rec</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rec-2/dp/B0056AFSTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rec 2</a>, is at the helm again, except that, divested of its found footage reality, it becomes just another zombie feature, although a fairly watchable one. Note that [REC] 3 is a parallel sequel. Its characters may inhabit the same universe as the casts of the first two films but they don't engage. For the gorehounds, there are some nice gory kills. And, as always, I like that, in these films, the zombie virus is rooted not in mad science but in the supernatural. This touches that scared, primal core within us. The cast gives out credible performances, especially the two leads, Leticia Dolera and Diego Martin. You do become invested in these newlyweds and their harrowing plight. And when a pissed-off Dolera in her ruined wedding dress picks up that chainsaw, man, it is over!!

Also I was rooting for SpongeJohn Squarepants (there's this copyright thing) to make it thru.

Two observations to highlight the plethora of dumb choices made by these meals on legs (and, by the way, SPOILERS alert):

- When you've just been chased by packs of the undead and you're out in the rain and you glimpse your mom but she's hunched over and there's blood on her and she's got this malevolent grin, get a clue and DO NOT FRIGGIN' APPROACH HER!

- With ghouls crawling out of the woodwork, DO NOT EVER discard the shield and mace and helmet you'd found just so you could inspect a panel of surveillance cameras. And should a zombie sneak up and you bury that mace into its skull, don't hesitate to pull that bad boy out post haste. And then you can indulge in angsty sh--. At least he kept the cuirass on.

There's a fourth REC film in the works, titled REC 4: APOCALIPSIS, and it supposedly will feature Manuela Velasco who reprises her role as Angela Vidal, the reporter from the first two films. Rumor is that REC 4 will not even a little bit be filmed in the found footage style.

5183537,5,B008UP0CIW,"This film was short, sweet and persistently effective, with some of the best blood work, tactfully sharp color-correction and beautiful filming of any zombie film.

HARDLY A SEQUEL:  There are loads of negative reviews out there of this movie. It seems that all such reviews are based on inconsistencies between this and the previous two REC films-especially the zombies' behavior.  So, folks.  Just stop doing that, get over your judgmental self (not that I'm any better), treat this movie as a stand-alone zombie film and enjoy!

In the first five minutes I realized that this film was accomplishing something that very few of the recent horror (or sci-fi-horror) movies managed--to present the characters and get you to like them in a manner such that, were you not told beforehand, you wouldn't know this was a horror movie until something awful happened.  Chernobyl Diaries (2012) tried, but the premise and setting was too blatant.  But Cloverfield (2008) really succeeded using the same found footage style.  For those of you who dislike found footage horror, this movie shifts to normal filming and presentation after about 20 minutes.  Until which our lead couple is very sweet, credibly humbled, and have an adorably choreographed first dance on their wedding day.

After a zombie outbreak initiates with patient zero in during their wedding reception, Koldo (Diego Martin) and Clara (Leticia Dolera) are separated and their resolve is tested.  Clara is more than just a pair of big bright eyes and innocence wrapped up in a snug wedding dress.  She turns into a credibly tough chick fighting for her future with Koldo, who I find to be sincere, but a much less effective character (than Clara) until the final scenes.

While having no effect on the ""zombie movie dynamic"" that we've come to expect, REC 3 takes a Biblical approach to its zombiism complete with holy water, flecks of gospel, and occasional imagery.  Combined with the personable introductory scenes of this film, I find this to have a more welcomed and original flavor than most zombie flicks.

The zombie action is quality, the gore is festive, the survivors' sense of terror and urgency feels very real, and no one has ever made a chainsaw look so damned sexy as Leticia Dolera!  This also may be the most beautifully shot zombie film I've seen since 28 Days Later (2002) and the color-corrected crispness of the blood occasionally borders on artistry.  The blood work was truly fantastic on all levels.  And the ending...GREAT.  The whole film was short, sweet and effective.  Oh, and don't worry if you haven't seen the other REC films. This is a solid stand-alone sequel.
If you see one zombie movie this decade, make this it!

REMAKE SIDEBAR  Paco Plaza wrote and directed all three REC films (2007, 2009, 2012) and wrote both remake Quarantine films (2008, 2011).  While Quarantine 2 was less of a remake, I'm left to wonder if there won't be a Quarantine 3 to complement REC 3.  Normally I'm all for more iterations and re-imaginings of the same movie.  However, REC 3 was so amazing I fear that no budget could possibly duplicate the perfection I witnessed...and I couldn't imagine replacing Leticia Dolera with anyone!  She was phenomenal!",1355616000,,3226,4.949814126394052
5183538,4,B008UP0CIW,"Firstly, you need (at least works better, I think) to have seen Rec-1 and Rec-2, before seeing 3 which jumps back to just before voume 1 was taking place and the issue with the infected dog and the Vet it was taken to -- here we meet the Vet with a bite on his hand, so if you have the first 2 volumes under your belt already, all the connections fire off pretty fast and the demonic element is already a conclusion you knew about.......so if you liked this, get 1 and 2. This one departs from the running at all times with a camera gritty realism, in that it drops that part way in and goes for standard movie shots ---but it worked pretty good, still liked it and am glad to have 1-2-3 and I ""thought"" from internet articles, that they have more planned.  Hope so, as I'd love to next fast forward to global demonic infection....at first I felt the romance angle was a little cheesy, but the way it played into what the ending was to be - I get why they played it that way..........AND.........please do note, that if all you saw was the American productions of these, I'm told they changed the Virus into a just a virus, not the result of a Vatican doctor/priest isolating an enzyme in the demonically possessed that could be formed into a viral strain, and then, they could concoct an ""Antidote"" against demonic possession.",1355443200,,1327,4.394308943089431

5183540,3,B008UP0CIW,"My expectation going in is that although this Mexican horror film, in spite of having a 3 in the title, was some sort of prequel to the first two.  Genesis actually appears to have a biblical significance and seems to be unrelated to the earlier films.  Well except for the zombies and other thematic elements.

The film opens with the now not unusual scene of a couple cameramen filming the wedding of Koldo and Clara in an elaborate, joyful wedding and the following reception.  We get a hint of what's to come when the groom's uncle is shown with a blood stained bandage on his hand.  The reception turns into bloody chaos when the families and friends turn into zoms.

From a technical viewpoint, the film transitions from the now routine ""found footage"" style about a third of the way in and becomes a more traditional film, all the better to see the colorful gore and violence.  This film has a goodly amount of humor as well, including some clever shots.  Leticia Dolera is particularly good as bride Clara who becomes separated from her new husband until the final act.

The original ""[REC]"" from 2007 was one of the better horror films of the decade and was remade as ""Quarantine"" in 2008.  It was followed by a crummy sequel which picked up where the original left off.

5183541,3,B008UP0CIW,"So another [REC] again. The third installment of the Spanish horror franchise is about Koldo (Diego Martn) and Clara (Leticia Dolera), newlyweds at their wedding party. What should be the happiest day in their life turns into a gore fest when one of the guests (who got his hand bitten by a dog) goes berserk. Well, I don't think I need to tell you the rest of the story. In short, it's a love story in a zombie movie. And I'm not joking.

While ""[REC]"" and its first sequel ""[REC 2]"" (helmed by directors Jaume Balaguer and Paco Plaza) were both quite serious in tone, with the effective use of first-person viewpoint that makes the film realistic, ""[REC 3]: Gnesis"" (directed by Paco Plaza alone) changes the visual style considerably. First, ""[REC 3]: Gnesis"" employs the POV narrative only partially. Most of the story is told in a conventional visual style. A more important change is that the film is given dark humor that was totally absent in the previous two ""[REC]"" films. The humor is not overdone, and the film has gory moments, but for some viewers, these changes are not what they expected.

Being a little tired of the ""found footage"" films, I for one do not hate these changes. The performances of the leads are pretty good. What I don't like is the weak storyline, especially its dull mid-section. The film could have milked outlandish ideas such as a chainsaw-wielding bride in blood-soaked wedding dress and a bridegroom clad in armor, as well as many of the incredibly melodramatic events, in order to make a more entertaining film.

As it is, ""[REC 3]: Gnesis"" remain what it is: a decent zombie movie with a corny romance. The film works as such, though whether it should be called ""[REC]"" is another matter.",1354147200,9,1730,4.684210526315789

i think when people see zombie films, the majority don't focus on the characters but more so on how the zombies are portrayed. the focus isn't on the actors, but if the zombies are fast, slow, realistic, etc. which is stupid because your missing the main story. thats why walking dead works. rec3 is like that, you are so wrapped up in the bride that the zombies become a side story.
brilliant spanish film, i highly recommend it if you want to see great acting, real emotion and some gore. great horror film with characters you WILL REMEMBER.
anyone whos been in love will instantly connect with the bride and groom. who else can portray intense love and passion like the spanish? surely not the majority of americans. this is why i love foreign films, especially french, italian and spanish. you get intense passion and chemistry in films you cant get here in the u.s. no matter what genre it is. loved it

These zombies are semi-intelligent, semi-foot dragging, and respond to scripture spoken. Their faces are cover with indelible blood that stays on in a heavy down pour.

5183544,5,B008UP0CIW,"As a horror flick its great, but as a sequel to Rec its quite weak and could have been so much better given the first two.  Overall on it's own it's a great, chilling, action packed, gore drenched shockfest...and I loved it.",1353801600,,224,4.333333333333333

8530569,4,B008UP0CIW,"Originally planned as a prequel but ending up appearing to take place more or less concurrently with the previous two movies, [REC] 3: Genesis sees an outbreak of the same phenomenon as in [REC] 1 and 2 occuring at the wedding reception of its two protagonists, Clara (Leticia Dolera) and Koldo (Diego Martin).  Though some of the movie is caught on camera in found footage style, the majority of the film skips this angle in favor of a more traditional narrative.  Another big departure from previous chapters of the series is in the overall tone.  While not a parody by any means, it does take some detours into black humor.  The change in style might take a while to get used to, but it ends up actually coming off very effective.  The movie is very well made, bloody and intense, and features a cast of likable characters falling victim to and fighting the zombie-like infection.  It was a bit of a risk taking so many departures from its predecessors, but it works out, and we have a very worthy third entry in the [REC] series.  Four-and-a-half stars.",1462838400,,1057,4.620320855614973
