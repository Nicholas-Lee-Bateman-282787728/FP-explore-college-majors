The econometrics detailing how the PUT options reached statistical significance was quite impressive. Dr Niels and his presentation on Nano-sized thermite and quite possibly thermate was equally impressive. I wouldn't have minded a presentation by note worthy individuals such as Mike Ruppert and Philip Marshall who respectively wrote the books ""Beyond the Rubicon"" and ""False Flag 9/11."" Both these individuals reportedly committed suicide between early 2013 and early 2014. Another person who disclosed covert CIA operations inside US borders, Gary Webb also allegedly committed suicide and wrote his book, ""The Dark Alliance."" Gary Webb was shot in the head twice, so makes the official story of suicide a bit more doubtful and suspicious.

The Toronto Hearings should be mandatory viewing by every one of our elected Congressman. Instead, we are lucky if there's the rare politician who reads such infractions against our freedoms such as the Patriot Act, a politician who reads but does not sign and support such legislation. Incidentally, did any Congressman ever admit they actually read the Patriot Act before signing it? Which would be a better reason to kick out a Congressman...someone who signed the Patriot Act but admits never actually reading it or a Congressman who admits reading it but then went ahead and signed it anyway? That's a trick question...both sorts of Congressman should be ousted. We don't have enough voters who insist on proper representation of the American people to have overall, a collective group of politicians devoted primarily to the best interest of the American people.

""Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists and the hopes of its children.
  Dwight D. Eisenhower

8522113,5,B007V4I34I,"This is a presentation of several scientific investigations into eye witness accounts, video and photographic evidence, business and public records, and analysis of WTC debris collected during and after the events of September 11, 2001.  Other investigations presented are more forensic in style in that they compare and contrast physical evidence and testimony to statements commonly accepted as correct.

The scientists were evidently asked to speak in layman's terms, since several mention that they're making an effort to do so.  However, those talks are backed by peer-reviewed, published papers that can be found online for more detailed technical data.

What's most refreshing is that the scientific panelists avoid politics and motives and stick to cold, hard facts on, for example, dust and air samples collected at the scene.  Non-scientific panelists discuss the politics of CIA and FBI investigations specifically.  Each panelist covers his or her own area of expertise followed by a question and answer session.  Some of the subjects discussed are ""Eyewitnesses and Evidence of Explosions at the Pentagon"",""Incendiary/Explosive Residue in the WTC Dust"", and ""9/11 and Deep State Politics"".

One of the panelists, Laurie Manwell, did a somewhat poor job in presenting her ""Democracy for the Few"" piece, a short (minute or two) section of her ""State Crimes Against Democracy and Psychological Resistance to Alternative Accounts"" talk.  The mini-rant is actually a quote she's reading, but it's easy to lose track of that and attribute the remarks to her.  In any case, that brief commentary is *not at all* representative of the rest of the four-day conference.

The presentations can also be found on YouTube by searching on ""Toronto Hearings"", and I believe there's far more material there than the six hours this DVD runs.  This is important information for people to have. I would encourage people with an interest in government to listen to it and draw their own conclusions.",1346803200,9,1991,5.325878594249201
8522114,5,B007V4I34I,"I have seen not only this video, but all of the information in its entirety on youtube.  ""Loose Change"" raised the questions, many others have answered some of them.  This documentary features some of the foremost experts and researchers with the very latest in information.  There are architects, chemists, physicists, Wall Street insiders, CIA experts, aviation experts, and the like all represented.  This is real information that anyone can look up themselves and verify.  Forget the ""straw-man"" erroneous conspiracy theories represented by Popular Mechanics and by joe public on youtube.  These people know what they are talking about and present the information in a clear, concise way that the common man can understand.
The most important thing when watching this video is to leave your preconceived notions at the door.  Know that there is a real cognitive dissonance that occurs when information is given that challenges your personal world view.  You will be challenged, but you will leave empowered with the knowledge of the truth.",1334707200,18,1043,5.278787878787878
