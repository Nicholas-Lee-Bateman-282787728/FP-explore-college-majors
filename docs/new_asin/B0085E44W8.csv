5132934,1,B0085E44W8,"I wish I would have listened to the other reviewer who gave this film a one star.  It would have saved me 60 minutes of my night.  I couldn't even finish this movie, it was that bad.  Normally when I see Wolfe Video, I expect a good gay drama.  They gave us movies like Gia and Elena Undone and The Gymnist.  Imagine my surprise when I popped this in and got just what the reviewer said; a dry porn with even worse acting.  There were 2 attractive women, but no chemistry, no story, and really, really bad acting.  The love scene in the hot tub reminded me of the pool scene in Showgirls, but worse.  To quote the film, ""My shoulders are so tight.  I haven't ridden a bike in a long time.""  Ok, how are your shoulders sore from that?  Did you pedal with your arms?  Come on!

I love a lot of Wolfe Video productions.  This one should never have been released.",1347753600,51,859,4.158536585365853
5132935,5,B0085E44W8,"Love stories - heterosexual or homosexual -, I find, are difficult to review. Many a time they only involve the love story between two people, and an eternal factor (e.g. another lover, a crime, etc.) usually is needed to spice it up. On occasion, too, nudity can be the savior of the movie for some. You have to be an incredible romantic to love these films. And I have to say that, after watching ""The Guest House,"" I felt quite surprised. This movie takes a passionate and sincere approach to real love, the one that is hard to forget.

Rachel (Ruth Reynolds) is young California woman who we meet at the beginning of the film, just as she is breaking up from her annoying boyfriend, and arriving home one morning just as her father Frank (Tom McCafferty) is going to work. The two of them live alone, because Rachel's mother died recently. Frank, who loves her deeply, is disappointed that she spent the night out and grounds her for the weekend. That same weekend, however, Frank's new employee, Amy (Madeline Merritt), is arriving from Iowa, and would be staying at the family's guest house, until she can live on her own. In addition, Frank is spending a couple of days on a business trip. This means, of course, that the two ladies would have some time for bonding, with Rachel taking Amy for a ride to Hollywood and other parts of Los Angeles. And yes, with little time and as expected, the friendship evolves into something very special, but with quite a dramatic ending.

""The Guest House"" is a small, sensual, and honest low-budget film that quite captures your attention. The story has some interesting twists and turns that keeps the drama alive. This movie is, definitely, another triumph for Wolfe Video, one of the few remaining independent films distributors still in the battle, which truly needs our support. (USA, 2012, color, 84 min).

So, between those, the porn nievery and the hot tub scene I have to think the idea was to show her feeling herself in love for the first time by a low buget filming, and it cracked me up!

Daughter is as mush a predator as her ""daddy"" comes off and overall this story was, as I said, beyond creepy.  With a few, very minor, changes to the script and scenes, this story could have been easily changed into a predator couple preying on unsuspecting victims and then murdering them and hiding the bodies.

5132964,1,B0085E44W8,"I wanted to see a lesbian movie that is a great love story with young attractive women.
I am still looking for that movie.

This movie was about two bisexual women who have a very short affair.

This movie was very boring and very slow with a pathetic plot and bad acting and no chemistry.
Even the sex scenes, which were very short and showed nothing, were boring.

The dialogue was so dull, like the two women were really reaching for something, anything, to say.

One woman would ask a really personal question out of nowhere, and the other would ask why and then answer awkwardly with short sentences.
For example, do you remember your first kiss, pause and eyes roll, well, how was it, it was soft, why do you ask, why do you look sad, why, what else, really, why, next question, where have you traveled to, give a really long laundry list of places, okay, next question.
You have been to a dozen places and you could talk about that, but instead you move on to the next boring question.
It felt like two twelve year old girls were talking, not adult women.

Everything, from the dialogue to the kissing to the sex, seemed forced, like they were trying way too hard and yet they really didn't care.
It felt like there was nothing there, but they wanted something to be there, but they really didn't care one way or the other.

It was like the two women were left together in the house with nothing to do and nowhere to go and so they were together just because.
It felt like Rachel would have had an affair with anyone who stayed at the house that weekend, male or female, just anyone.
It felt like Amy would have had an affair with anyone who happened to be around and paid her any attention.

SPOILERS..

Here is the entire movie in a few sentences, because there isn't much to tell.

Rachel is living with her widowed father who has just grounded her for staying out all night all of the time.
She says that she is leaving for college in one week, but then that fact seems dropped.

Rachel just got dumped by her creepy boyfriend, Jason.

The father tells her that his employee (Amy) is coming to stay at their guest house that night (Friday night), and she will start working for him on Tuesday morning.

He goes out of town that night, supposedly not returning until Tuesday morning.

So, Rachel and Amy meet on that night, a Friday night, and Amy is immediately taking her clothes off and getting into the shower with the door open while Rachel peeks in.

They drink wine and ask each other personal questions, and it feels like they are reaching for things to say, the dialogue feels uncomfortable and awkward and boring and forced.

Rachel is presented as a lonely goth girl, simply by her hair and makeup and clothes, but by the way that she talks, we are supposed to believe that she is really a sensitive deep person underneath, who wants to write songs about deep issues, mainly about her mother's death.

We hear nothing of any importance about Amy.

Amy says that she is going to sleep, and instead, she peeks in on Rachel masturbating to a lesbian porn movie.

Then, it's the next morning, and they go shopping and go to the beach and they are having sex by Saturday night.

They spend Sunday together, more sex, a hot-tub scene, a shower scene, and the kissing and sex seem forced, there is no chemistry, no romance, no passion, it looks like everything that they do together is because they have nothing better to do instead.

Regarding the sex, all that is shown is one naked butt and one nipple poked out of a bra for an instant, and the sex is a few short moments of the entire movie, so if you blink, you will miss it.

The ex-boyfriend, Jason, shows up while Amy and Rachel are seemingly naked under the water and kissing in the hot-tub.
The three of them shout at each other for a moment and Jason just leaves.
There is so much that they could have done with that scene, but it just ends flatly, and they are just kissing again, like okay whatever.

By Monday morning, they are calling it Love.  But based on what?
The father comes home early and catches his daughter and employee naked in bed.
He shouts at them, and it comes out that the father and Amy had had sex before, which is basically how and why Amy got the job.
The father was obviously expecting to get some sex with Amy that morning.
Seeing that his daughter is getting the sex instead, the father tells Amy to get out.
Amy and Rachel argue for about a minute and then immediately break up.  So much for Love.
Amy is left with nowhere to stay and no job, but the movie just drops that part of the story.

Suddenly, the movie ends with Rachel singing in a club, and you get the impression that a few months have passed.
Amy shows up with a different hair color.
They talk about maybe just being friends for about a minute, and then suddenly they are kissing.

I really hated Rachel's hair.
Her hair was very thin, and I hated the goth colors and style.
I hated her hair so much that I found it distracting from the movie and worth commenting on.

I kept waiting for the movie to get better and for something to happen.

At the beginning, when Rachel and Jason broke up, it was said that they had been together for their entire senior year and the entire summer afterward.
So, how was Rachel suddenly a lesbian?

Amy had slept with Rachel's father ""just once"" but she also talked about how she always used men and had lots of affairs with men.
So, how was Amy a lesbian?

Rachel and Amy had a weekend affair simply because they were alone in a house together for the weekend with nothing better to do.
What kind of a lesbian affair was that?
There was no flirting, no dating, no passion, no attraction, no lust, no romance, no meaning.
They spent a few hours together, kissed, had sex, and simply broke up without an argument or a discussion, and it ends as quickly as it started.

And Rachel later called it Love and said that the experience changed her.
But her year and a half with Jason made no impact on her life?

The end.
They are kissing and we get the impression that they are back together, and I asked myself why.",1440115200,2,6113,4.36331569664903

I myself am a 51 year old man who is married to an extraordinary woman and together we have a beautiful daughter.

Sadly, this movie was neither.  It was a badly put together story, coupled by sub-par acting, with a bit of soft core porn sprinkled in.  I may be biased...  I hate soft core porn.  For me, if it has to be porn, then it should be unabashedly filthy, kinky, and honest.  I like things to be honest and forward when it comes to that...  And for that reason, the only points that I can give this movie is that it actually was a half baked love story about two women (I don't find those too often), and that it did have a plot, granted a badly written one. This movie got two stars because there are movies out there that are worse that deserve none.

Also, I should again mention how bad the acting was...  The main characters were so one- dimensional, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  Call me high maintenance, but a pulse and female sex organs are not enough for me to like a character in a film.",1434412800,,1156,4.204545454545454

I was going to chop (not a good thing) this movie up because I thought the main characters, Amy (fresh out of college) & Rachel (high school graduate heading to college), maturity levels were off, and I wasn't feeling the chemistry between the two of them.  But, after watching it a few times (have to get my money's worth, lol) I changed my mind.  The maturity levels weren't off but more so the characters did a metamorphoses by the movie's end that I missed the first (and second) time around.

I perceived Amy as a mature educated person because she was recently graduated from college.  And, she was.  However, she was inexperienced in the area of relationships (specifically love & intimacy) which she experienced for the first time with Rachel.

The protagonist IF she can really play the piano she's good at it but needs voice lessons as she can't project her voice when she sings and she's not really that good of a singer ether. Next let's talk about the cut scans...They were regular straight cuts with the fade out right were a commercial would be if this was on TV. At the end all you saw was the golden gate no time frame about how long it had been since the LAST scene. Now the Ex boy friend let's talk about that he just walks right in to her back yard what BULL. Obviously this must be a low budget film with the pot use & the cuts that have no meaning at all except to get to the next part the editors cut WAY too soon or someone did as there was more substance needed before the fade out cut. So yeah it was ok but NOT worth your time or effort to buy or even see it sucks BIG TIME!!!!!",1390176000,,1163,3.845833333333333

5133147,3,B0085E44W8,"I don't generally review movies, but I'll give this one a shot because it was a bad movie whose storyline managed to keep me interested enough to watch.  The storyline is actually not that bad if only it had been presented and directed with a little more style.  The plot has sort of a Victorian tragedy / romantic chick-flick / Jane Austen thing going on but the directing is just plain bad (sucks terribly, in fact) and the acting is understandably nervous and amateurish due essentially to novice performers being poorly directed. A director need some talent and patience to properly encourage novice actors, and this one didn't.  So the whole thing unfortunately presents as a drawn-out porno intended for a semi-sophisticated audience.

  In all fairness though, I do thing that Ruth Reynolds shows a great deal of promise - all she needs is some better coaching, some better directing, and a decent break.  Hopefully for her, someone in the upper-end of the biz might notice that fact and give her a real chance to prove herself.  I could see her in something with a lot more vitality - like a cop drama or sci-fi.  She might even be great in the right sort of sit-com as she appears to be quick-witted and capable of fast and intelligible verbal delivery.

  I give the film a 3 1/2 for storyline and Ms. Reynolds' efforts to make a bad and poorly directed film at least somewhat bearable for the audience.  So be open-minded and give Ruth Reynolds a break, and just take a look. Maybe you'll see something shine through in an otherwise disappointing attempt at cinema. You can always turn it off.",1381795200,,1604,4.665480427046264

5133179,4,B0085E44W8,"18 year-old Goth bad girl Rachel (Ruth Reynolds) lives in an affluent area of Los Angeles with her wealthy father (Tom McCafferty). A once aspiring songwriter, Rachel has abandoned music after her mother's recent death. As her father deals with his wife's death in his own way, he neglects Rachel, leaving her to fend for herself. When her father's new employee Amy (Madeline Merritt) arrives to stay in their guesthouse for a few days however, things begin looking up for Rachel.

With Rachel's father away for the weekend, the girls are free to share their hopes and most hidden desires. This leads to several sexy encounters as the girls explore the strong attractions they are feeling for each other. By the end of the weekend, they have fallen in love, but how much do they really know about each other and what secrets maybe hiding beneath the surface.

Director Michael Baumgarten has created a thoughtful love story built on the premise of chance meeting between two young women and the impact that this encounter has on their lives.

Ruth Reynolds and Madeline Merritt convincingly portray the relationship between Rachel and Amy as they discover the ability to open up a secret part of each other that has been kept hidden away from others.

Sadly, the entire movie just feels like it ""happens"". It was not engaging and def not what the community comes to expect from Wolfe Entertainment. You could see the actors tried, sort of. At the same time, neither made the experience feel like you're ""in"" a movie. Several times both looked directly at the camera, giving a weird, voyeur-vibe like bad, soft-core porn.

This book has a good  story line. I would suggest reading this book, a wonderful story line. I just can't enough of the writers books. Shes a wonderful writer.",1362960000,2,244,4.282608695652174

5133189,1,B0085E44W8,"I really wanted to like this movie. The plot sounded good and I am always on the lookout for a decent, romantic lesbian movie. The acting in this movie was bad from the beginning. But my partner and I kept watching hoping that at least if the plot stunk, there might be some sex scenes that would make the movie have some entertainment value for us. There was a lot of flirting, some kissing and some undressing, but sex scenes were collages of images of women in underwear. Seemed PG-rated if you ask me. The plot was contrived and hokey, like a porno movie. But at least with a porno movie you get some payoff in the form of hot sex scenes. This movie was a big plot bore with no payoff. If it had a decent plot and acting, I could have gotten into it even with the PG-rated sex scenes, but it didn't have that going for it.

In summary, whenever my partner and I hear this movie's name now we groan and talk about how bad it was! We would warn others to not waste their time. There are other, much better, movies out there. This is one of the worst lesbian movies of all time!",1361750400,,1079,4.162679425837321
5133190,5,B0085E44W8,"What in God's name was wrong with this movie??
In the past few years, I've become a connoisseur of lesbian-themed movies.
I've watched close to 100 of them.
They've ranged from borderline pathetic to so moving I couldn't stop crying for minutes after the end!
I've seen lesbian flicks with LOTS of nudity and sex, and ones with maybe a 10 second glimpse at the lover's bedroom activities!!
I've seen them end tragically, and ones that made me smile joyously giddily!!
And I'm a 68 year old heterosexual male!!

The Guest House is one of the very BEST lesbian movies I've ever seen.
I read some of the most critical reviews, and I can't understand why you were so harsh to this erotic romantic and insightful flick.

It reminds me somewhat of the two movies, Before Sunrise and Before Sunset.
Except that instead of taking place in one day, it happens over a full weekend.
And instead of a boy-girl combo, you have a girl-girl!!
They spend the weekend getting to know each other....at first playfully, drinking wine when underage, carousing about town.
After having sex, they find that the connecting of bodies---very attractive bodies, I might add!---connects their hearts as well.
Love.....and falling in love....is something so very hard to explain.
Sometimes, you have to just let it fall (sic!) upon you....have to let IT direct you down new paths.
In The Guest House, despite a surprising revelation that threatens their relationship, things end well.
(Sorry if I've revealed too much!!)
Watch this movie....while snuggling with your lover....and best friend.",1361318400,,1564,4.988505747126437
