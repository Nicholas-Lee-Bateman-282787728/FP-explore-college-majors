I can watch this show over and over again and still enjoy it as much as the fist time. If you are considering buying this show you will not be disappointed. As you can probably guess this show has lots of action but it is also a love story. When the show first starts the main character is very self centered and doesn't aspire to much in life. In the second episode he discovers that he is a father and that his daughter is ill with leukemia and that he is a eligible donr for her bone marrow transplant. Just after Te San finds out he can save his daughter he is framed for murder, but before he can prove his innocence the true murders are intent on killing him. So to save his daughter Te San escapes and must avoid not only the police but also the mafia group that is trying to silence him. I would highly recommend this show to everyone.",1426896000,3,999,4.128205128205129
