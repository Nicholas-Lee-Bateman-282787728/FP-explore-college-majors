4171885,4,B003QTBSWQ,the movie was good...it touched on a taboo subject that relates to the number 1 sexual fantasy in america. i liked it there were a lot of subtle things in the movie that made it enjoyable...the editing could have been cleaned up a bit but all in all a good ol horror movie.,1287360000,10,273,4.169811320754717
4171886,2,B003QTBSWQ,"Interesting plot...could have been an interesting movie. But it wasn't because it was so dark, poorly lit and grainy that I had absolutley no idea what was going on for 3/4 of the movie. I just listened to the audio to try and figure out what was going on..",1285804800,29,257,4.26530612244898
4171887,4,B003QTBSWQ,"This flick takes a really good stab at evoking the style of 70's exploitation horror films like ""Last House on the Left"" and ""I Spit on Your Grave"". It manages to give the proceedings a modern day slant, though. In this film, our main character is a willing victim. She invites strangers into her home to fulfill her dark sexual fantasies. Of course, things don't exactly work out the way she planned, and...Well, it wouldn't be horror film if they did. Would it? This flick is pretty gory and moves at a quick pace. It's definitely low budget, but it works towards the style that's being recreated. Also, the gore effects are pretty top notch despite the obviously low budget. If you're a fan of down and dirty horror flicks of yester-year, you should def check this out.",1285459200,34,772,4.601449275362318

8402528,1,B003QTBSWQ,Was not aware of how low budget it was. Looks like it was filmed as a high school project and the title is kind of misleading. Not worth it.,1427068800,,140,3.8620689655172415
8402529,1,B003QTBSWQ,"This movie is a piece of crap. The quality is very poor. I could have shot a much better film on my phone. Wasn't looking for academy award acting, but they really suck. I Felt DEFILED for buying this crap.",1425600000,,206,4.175

8402534,1,B003QTBSWQ,"Some movies are so bad they unwittingly back into brilliance. Plan 9 from Outer Space, Wild Women of Wongo, Robot Monster all achieve this.

This movie backs unwittingly into the garage door. There isn't a component of it that hasn't been worked to death or abandoned as not worth the effort by everyone else in the film world.

Lessee:

Bad Acting: Check.
Hackneyed Plot: Check.
No appreciation of how to balance sound levels: Check.
No appreciation of how to balance light levels: Check.
Wildly mismatched musical soundtrack/images: Check.
Unrealistic horror SFX: Check.
Shaky camera because the maker can't afford a tripod, steadycam or dolly and too stupid to improvise: Check.
Stupid, uninspired, boring, clichd dialog: Check.
Inexplicable cutaway scenes that are supposed to be metaphorical and deep but just look like someone edited in a few frames of some other movie by mistake: Check, but at least the camera was still.

Dear god, this is a bad movie. You'd think that a movie in which voluntary rape roleplaying would at least have a prurient perv factor working in its favor but even that was done badly. At one point the movie froze and I was actually glad.

SPOILERS IF YOU WANT TO WATCH THIS PIECE OF UTTER RUBBISH AND BE SURPRISED, FIRST OF ALL YOU WON'T BE BECAUSE NOTHING IN THIS MOVIE GOES ANYWHERE YOU WON'T SEE A MILE OFF, AND SECOND STOP READING.

At one point the intruder nails the victim's hand to the floor with what looks like a gutter spike. Victim squeaks a bit, (rather unconvincingly in my opinion) then we see the nailed hand moving so it is obvious the sawed-off nail is glued to the hand. Then she rips her hand off the nail, past the head with some more unconvincing squeaks. Then she doesn't bleed to death and the intruder stitches her up (during which she doesn't so much as suck in her breath) and her hand works just fine, and apparently doesn't hurt a bit. So a total fail on the grisly torture maiming scene (entirely justified by the plot of course).

And considering the premise: a girl who solicits anonymous rough sex on the internet (as one does), there is precious little naked female bod on display. This movie might have been saved if the segments of monologuing intruder were replaced with unclad victim in the shower scenes.

I'd say I feel sorry for everyone involved in this piece of unexcellence made manifest except for the fact that they knew what they were getting into.

It isn't often that one comes across a movie in which no-one from the catering service up knows anything about what they are doing. The only thing about this movie that shows promise is the title.

Seriously, there is nothing here for anyone. Fans of taught plotting will be left wanting. Fans of riveting story will be left unriveted. Fans of clever scripting will want to shoot themselves long before the film's end. Fans of cinematography will want to claw their eyes out. Sound fans will be looking for a knitting needle with which to burst their eardrums. Fans of nudity will abandon this movie for the internet before the halfway point. Fans of torture porn will, well, I don't know. It's a genre I can't see the point in myself and I can't find any empathy for its fans in myself. Even the bondage isn't convincing.

Save your money. There's better stuff than this on YouTube, and this turkey is WAY overpriced for something that looks and sounds like it was shot using a smartphone.",1354752000,,3420,4.692821368948247
8402535,2,B003QTBSWQ,"This movie was very poorly shot. Know good bondage scenes. The rape part was a joke save
your money and do not buy this movie.",1320710400,11,126,4.08
8402536,2,B003QTBSWQ,I prefer a little more production sosphiscation. After starting interestingly Movie kind of developes slowly and never felt the so calledterror,1300752000,3,143,5.857142857142857
