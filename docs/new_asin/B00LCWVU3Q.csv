6479532,5,B00LCWVU3Q,"Directors turn a script into a movie; and Joseph James has done this artfully and with great skill. I enjoyed seeing his growth as a director since I first became a fan watch his last film ""Templar Nation"". Directors work with actors; makeup artists; cinematographers; writers; and film, sound, and lighting technicians and in each film I like to see progress and a transformation over the one before. It is an ever growing process to achieve a higher level of understanding of their craft. In this film, you can see that this has happened, from the caliber of Actors like Sean Astin, Randy Wayne, and Alex Mckenna to Richard Dutcher making a return appearance. What a well-rounded cast of characters. The appropriateness of the actors, of the script, and how the scenes were shot, all lead to a fun finished product that left me wondering where the film would take me next. It had great feel, as you were taken along on a ride with Rana the wealth daughter and heiress,  and Cryus the free-lance writer she has retained to help solve the mystery of her murdered father. We learn more about them as they learn more about themselves and each other. Can they trust each other let alone anyone else? And what is this strange and cryptic group of men who are intertwined with this case? I will have to go back and find his first film ""The Masonic Map""while I keep looking forward to the next installment. II",1405468800,,1403,4.612
6479533,4,B00LCWVU3Q,"Joseph James brings a timeless organization that has been a topic of interest and controversy for centuries to the forefront with characters that accurately portray a mixed view of different perspectives. This film served as great entertainment with its well known star, Sean Astin (Rudy, Goonies, Lord of the Rings) and numerous plot twists; a good old fashioned 'who done it?' James used real Freemasons and Masonic Temples in their respective roles and although there were some 'differences' in how a large majority of the fraternity operates, it remains pretty accurate in its form.

This is a film that is certain to make Freemasons proud as it's the first time a major film has been made where Freemasonry is the main character, in stead of just referencing a few symbols.",1405468800,,778,4.984615384615385
6479534,5,B00LCWVU3Q,"The film was well put together, very professional and theatrical quality. It surpassed what I expected it to be. I felt that the film was moving at a good fast pace and kept me intrigued constantly throughout the film.

The suspense in the movie kept me on my toes and guessing. The ending was a shocking surprise.  This film is not the typical ""I know who did it"" right off the bat. It is almost interactive with the way it keeps you wondering.

Additionally, this film lets you peak into the world of Freemasonry. This film has touches of Freemasonry wrapped throughout it and gives quite the comprehensive look into how the they operate while still being respectful. Matter in fact there are scenes in this film that are filmed at an actual Freemason temple which adds for an authentic touch.

I watched it with my friends and overall we all agree that it was an enjoyable and entertaining film!",1405382400,4,898,4.59375
6479535,5,B00LCWVU3Q,"Great movie, keeps you guessing throughout the movie, and is a good insight on Freemason history. I watched it with My wife, and then watched it with the kids (8-10 years) and it kept them interested.",1405209600,5,200,4.583333333333333
6479536,4,B00LCWVU3Q,"I met Joseph James, Richard Dutcher, and briefly Sean Astin at the Salt Lake Fantasy con this past weekend. Being a fan of local independent films, I was surprised I hadn't heard of this movie. The Freemason perked my interest, as I've never seen a movie featuring the Mason's in any capacity. I knew a little about them, but was curious to know more. I'm a longtime fan of Sean Astin's and have enjoyed Richard Dutcher's work. Mr. James and Mr. Dutcher had booths promoting their films. Both were both very nice. Mr. James took time to explain various things about the Mason's (mentioning he is a 32nd degree Mason) and tell me about the film. Mr. James went to quite a bit of trouble to get the blessing of his fellow Freemason's on this project and to be able to film in the Salt Lake ""El Kalah"" Shrine temple. I purchased a copy and found it to be an interesting show. Not a bad story line. Quality filming. Some of the lines were a bit cheesy and a few of the actors seemed very uncomfortable with line delivery, which made it drag in a few places. A great job for a first effort. Keep it up Joseph.",1404777600,5,1104,4.3125
6479537,4,B00LCWVU3Q,"Overall not a bad movie, and it was nice to see a movie that didn't treat Freemasons as uber-bad guys because of their secrecy. The plot kept me (mostly) engaged, although I wish more time had been spent in character development. The movie seemed to drag in a few places because it seemed like the characters spent a lot of time driving around or sitting in cars rather than really interacting with each other. (Yes, the characters have to get from point a to point b and then point c, and they use cars to do that. That doesn't mean we have to actually spend time watching them drive there.)",1404691200,6,592,4.390909090909091
6479538,5,B00LCWVU3Q,"Really enjoyed this film. Suspense that was not predictable. I'm a big fan of Sean Astin from Rudy to Samwise Gamgee to Doug in 50 First Dates. I must say I'm now a fan of Joseph James. Thanks to Robert Johnson at the Whence Came You podcast and Juan Sepulveda at The Winding Stairs as well as the guys on the Masonic Roundtable for speaking so highly of this film. This film is not just for those who are Freemasons. This is a great tale of a man seeking to find the truth. In reality he finds out many things about himself on the journey. This is one that I will watch more than one time. There is a lot of depth and creativity in this tale. My one wish is that it could have been longer. I would like to have seen more depth in character development of a couple of the lesser characters. This is not a complaint....it just means that for me, personally, I really got into the tale and wanted to know more and more. That said, a good movie leaves you satisfied, but a great film always leaves you wanting more.",1404604800,8,1012,4.168367346938775

6479543,2,B00LCWVU3Q,"A REVIEW FROM A FREEMASON

My wife purchased this for me because I'm a Mason and she figured I'd like it.  The movie is awful!  It DOES portray Masons in a semi-postive way, though it still shows them to be shadowy and super rich/powerful. Most of my brothers are working and middle class, and the ones who are really rich still meet us on the level. We don't like the ultra exclusive feel bc we want good, average men,  to feel like they're welcome. Seriously, my membership dues are $70 per YEAR -- if you're a good man and you believe in some form of higher power...and you're not a former or current felon, you can be a Mason.

 The movie also gets A Lot wrong, has parts that are stupid,  limited character development and a ridiculous romance. Lastly, the part with the voting, though accurate,  is just so, so very dumb.

Overall,  it got two stars because it had the potential to be great,  and it just wasn't. I'm donating my copy to the lodge so no one else wastes money on this.",1469577600,4,989,4.320652173913044

6479552,1,B00LCWVU3Q,"While the film portrayed Freemasonry in a positive light (pun intended), there were a few major flaws.  First, the acting was horrible.  It was so bad that I was uncomfortable at times watching.  I can't believe Sean Astin did so poorly as well.  I expected a lot more from Samwise/Rudy.  Second, the script was uneven, implausible and had poor transitions between scenes.  Lastly, good direction and beautiful cinematography can sometimes make up for a substandard screenplay; unfortunately this film had neither.  If I could have given it a negative star, I would have given it -2.  Yes, it was that bad.",1455753600,2,606,4.930693069306931

It portrays us nicely and properly, while still leaving out enough of our rituals and 'secrets' so as not to disclose anything. But what a horrible movie overall. Even the one ""known"" actor's acting was so bad. Directing, production, acting was just shameful. I wouldn't suggest buying this movie for anything other than saying you have it.

6479598,1,B00LCWVU3Q,"*edit* Fixing this review so I don't hurt anyone's feelings as pointed out by a commenter.:

This movie was just terrible.  The only redeeming quality was that it was fun to find the next thing to laugh at in the movie.  The storyline is predictable, there are tons of holes that should have been closed and frankly, ninja-motorcycle-thugs put this over the top.

One of the most memorable scenes was realizing that the two main characters were about to engage in a little extra curricular activity.  Interestingly enough as they were getting cozy, there were still police in the room!  Wait, what?  Did the police just quietly leave instead of finishing their investigation or were they watching intently over a box of movie popcorn?

I was surprised that the director name associated with this film was not Alan Smithee.

Honestly I had low expectations going into this film, but found I needed even lower expectations.  I hope that this movie does not totally destroy Sean Austin's career - he is a good actor; we need characters like Rudy and Samwise.

I cannot fathom why this movie gets good ratings, unless I have a different copy than everyone else who +1 this movie.

6479623,3,B00LCWVU3Q,"In North America, fraternal organizations and civic clubs in general -- Freemasons, Knights of Columbus, Odd Fellows, Rotary, and so on -- are facing an aging and declining membership due to numerous factors. As answer, the Freemasons in North America and United Kingdom had been making extra efforts to revitalize its declining and aging membership using 21st-century media techniques -- spending millions of dollars in marketing and publicity. This movie is one of Freemasonry's marketing techniques -- executive producer Joseph James, a Master Mason himself, produced a movie. The movie is okay but not too exciting. The story was predictable. But good marketing strategy for membership.",1407024000,,690,5.518867924528302
6479624,4,B00LCWVU3Q,"I met Joseph James and Richard Dutcher at the Salt Lake Fantasy Con where I purchased the film. I don't have much experience with local independent films, but when you add Sean Astin, filmed in Utah, and murder mystery, what's not to love? Although it was rough in some sections (the sound could have matched up better, and the script was very, very forced in certain areas), I can see where other filmmakers could use this as a great example to learn from. For example, from the beginning James focused on what he knew and went to quite a bit of trouble to get the blessing of his fellow Freemason's on this project and to be able to film in the Salt Lake ""El Kalah"" Shrine temple. It was clear that Sean Astin was the veteran actor on the show, but I was impressed by the variety of shots used throughout the film. It may be independent, but they had arial shots, time-lapse, close ups, moving pans, and other methods that made the transitions and shots very interesting. Definitely something to dissect if you need ideas for your own independent film. As an added bonus, if you're familiar with Utah, it's also very fun to recognize all the areas. Interested to see what he does next.",1406332800,,1187,4.5
6479625,5,B00LCWVU3Q,"I watched the movie ""The Freemason"" a few nights ago with my husband. Usually when we watch a movie together we are doing other things like surfing the web, making a snack, or playing with our dog. However, ""The Freemason"" kept both of our attention, and we closed up the computers, waited for snacks, and let the dog go lay in her bed. We really wanted to pay close attention to the movie as all the characters, and the storyline unfolded.
This movie falls under the genre of a ""ritualistic murder mystery"", a cross between James Patterson, and Alfred Hitchcock.  So many of the actors including; Sean Astin, Richard Dutcher, Randy Wayne, Alex McKenna, and the creator of the film ""Joseph James"" are mesmerizing.
This movie takes a respectful look of the secret society of Freemasonry, and one of the greatest details about this film is that Joseph James is a 32nd degree In the Scottish Rite of the Freemasons for real.

I love to watch the ""special features"" of a movie, or do research to get some of my questions answered. One of the questions

that I found the answer to was that ,""The Freemason"" was filmed partially in a real Masonic Temple in Salt Lake City, Utah with real Masons who not only acted in this film but, also gave their blessings. This was important to me because I have a son who also is a 32nd degree in the Scottish Rite of the Freemasons, and when I was growing up I was a Rainbow Girl, and I have a lot of respect for the Masons.
 Pop some popcorn, pour a cold drink, and then get ready to enjoy an hour and half of pure suspense, murder and mystery,
 and then write your own reviews after you watch it.
For an added bonus Sean Astin fans will not be disappointed. This is a movie where you can't predict the end, and it just might make you sit at the end of the couch, and curl your toes like I did mine.

I only have one thing I didn't like about ""The Freemason"" movie, and that is, I wish it had been longer so I could have

learned more about the characters. Could that possibly mean that there is ""The Freemason 2"" movie in the works ?

I guess we need to wait, and see, however, I for one would love to see a sequel.",1405728000,4,2149,4.275862068965517
6479626,5,B00LCWVU3Q,"The movie gives you a fair insight into Freemasonry. The story line is
suspenseful and intriguing with twists that will keep you on your feet.
Even more fun for Freemasons and their families or anyone with an
interest in Freemasonry.

I love the role of the Grand Master, he was very Grand Mastery, giving
credibility to the movie.

Sean Astin was fantastic, he did a great job. Alex McKenna did an
excellent job at her role.

Bottom line, a great movie with an action packed ending.

Well Done!",1405728000,,495,4.590909090909091

Disappointed in the quality of the acting (especially the main character) and overall story and production. I love all secret society movies when they are well done.
