8125095,5,B000FOT9P8,"If you love the book Beatrice's Goat then you must see this video.
Beatrice is now in grad school in Arkansas but the video doesn't go quite that far into her future since it was made 5 years ago.
You can see more up to date videos on the Internet now of her current life as her success continues.",1241049600,4,297,4.0508474576271185
8125096,5,B000FOT9P8,"The story of Beatrice is an independent look at how the work of Heifer International makes a real, lasting difference in the lives of millions.  While Beatrice's story is exceptional in its catapulting of a young girl from the poverty of a village in Uganda to college in the United States,  Heifer International's ability to give communities the tools and self-reliance to move them out of poverty are not.  You also have to give Beatrice great credit for her drive and passion for learning.  In the US, we would do well to remember how valuable the gifts of independence and thirst for knowledge and education are.",1235260800,3,616,4.783018867924528
