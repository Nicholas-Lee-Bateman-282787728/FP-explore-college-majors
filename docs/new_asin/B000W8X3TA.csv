8221668,2,B000W8X3TA,"Jordon Oliver (Bob Dishy) has been fired from his job for embezzling. His wife Clarice (Joanna Barnes) wants a divorce and Jordon does a lousy Bogart impersonation. He plans on taking out a million dollar policy on her and then bump her off. But first he must have a doctor examine her...without her knowing it. Enter a young Pat Morita. Jordon contracts Bill Dana to do the job, but then changes his mind when he discovers the doctor is a fraud and he doesn't have a policy. Unfortunately Bill Dana has subcontracted the work to someone who has subcontracted the work and so on. Jordan and his entourage run around acting zany as if this was an early 1960's film.

The film has many second tier comedians of the era. Unfortunately the comedy it tried to create, didn't make it. It spoofs mafia films, but not too well.  Available on a 50 DVD pack of the Swinging Seventies.

8221669,5,B000W8X3TA,"This movie clearly has a small budget and unfortunately, the budget does matter with comedies as well. The humor in this movie is mostly dialog driven with some bad special effects attempts at comedy in the second half because I doubt the filmmakers could afford to pull these scenes off convincingly.

What's typical also with low budget movies is that they look and feel a little out of date when they're released. This is because the filmmakers are often driven to make the kind of movies they want long before they can afford to. This movie feels like it should have been made in the mid to late 60's instead of 1976. This movie reminds me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Who-s-Minding-The-Mint/dp/B006P0FI2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Who's Minding The Mint?</a>.

That isn't to say this is a bad movie because it's not. Among low budget comedies, this is pretty good. The humor is zany and the zaniness definitely out does the late 70's multi million dollar Pink Panther movies (not to mention everything associated with the Pink Panther after Sellers died) by a mile. Pink Panther Strikes Again, Revenge of the Pink Panther and The Trail of the Pink Panther are horrific compared to this.",1377734400,,1951,6.707509881422925
8221670,1,B000W8X3TA,"It took me about 30 seconds to regret sitting down to watch ""I Wonder Who Is Killing Her Now?"" starring the saccharine Bob Dishy as Jordan Oliver, a criminal businessman caught embezzling from his employer. Dishy is smarmy and unlikable in this unfunny comedy, but in fairness the material doesn't give him much to work with. The concept here is that Dishy is in a bind for money so tries to have his wife assassinated for the insurance proceeds; he gets this idea from the only modestly amusing concept in the film in which a movie-within-a-movie concept is used to (relatively) good effect, although the musical number that epiphany causes is less enjoyable.

A series of murder-for-hire subcontracts, wacky characters, and predictable situations are the driving forces behind the ""comedy"" in the film. Dishy appears playing a piano in a chicken suit in yet another comedic fraud; a very bad caricature of an Asian doctor provides extensive pain for the audience while conducting an undercover examination of Dishy's wife; and perhaps most embarrassingly, Dishy constantly imitates Humphrey Bogart, violating the cardinal rule which says that it is very unwise to make references to a good movie in the middle of a bad movie. Among the unsavory individuals encountered is Bill Dana as ""Captain Bobo"", a ruffian in debt to the mob, an Indian musician who wants the money from the scheme for $4000 worth of lip gloss, and the worst Bela Lugosi impersonator in film history working at a weight loss clinic. This is a repellant picture and I can't think of any reason to recommend it to any audience.",1298332800,2,1598,4.9185185185185185
