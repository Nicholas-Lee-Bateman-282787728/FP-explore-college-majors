8125087,1,B000FOTA02,Thanks for providing me the opportunity to review this dirty product thant carries no substance. Its just a farce showing 60 Minutes in bold and documentary is no more than 7 minutes. Its nothing else than minting money by deceit. your product doesn't even deserve to be rated '1 star' but I can't find any other option in your drop down bar to give it the rating it really deserves. Nonsense!,1168560000,,393,4.549295774647887
