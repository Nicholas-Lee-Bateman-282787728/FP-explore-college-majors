2737136,5,B000MMMTD2,"Here in the UK, we are currently watching this fascinating mini-series.

The story is original and the parts are well played.

It's Science Fiction but, because of the contemporary setting and the restrictions governing each 'object', it doesn't feel like sci-fi. Yes, there are objects with incredulous power, however, it is the characters that drive the story and not the objects.

Personally, I'd like to see this as a regular series on TV but I get the impression as another poster has already stated, that story-lines would quickly become stale tracking down the objects each week.

It may be an idea for the producers to periodically release a two-hour special that would keep our interest and yet not dilute the show. That way, more money could be ploughed into the writing and production, rather than spreading it thinly across 6, 13 or even 20 episodes.

I've no doubt that a series would be popular and yet less would definitely be more.",1170374400,10,947,4.857142857142857
2737137,5,B000MMMTD2,"This mini series was completely entertaining! I absolutely loved it. Hopefully they'll make it into a continuing series.

Although, the plot is pretty simple the story line is unique and fantasic. I've watched it three times already. Once with friends all the way through in one sitting. Outstanding.",1169942400,11,300,5.25
2737138,4,B000MMMTD2,"I don't disagree with the previous reviews, but I think the unresolved mystery at the heart of the show is best left that way. The joy is in the journey. The peculiar characteristics of the objects have a surreal quality, an exercise of pure imagination, that is very engaging (Andre Breton would probably have loved this story). The really compelling aspect of Lost Room, I think, is the variety of reactions to these objects. People band together to collect them, worship them, or suppress them; individuals seek them as personal talismans, weapons, valuables, or just to enhance their own self-worth. It gives the story depth, and lifts it into the realm of intelligent SF. Fans of PK Dick, Star Trek, Firefly, and the golden age of SF would probably all enjoy this show. I don't usually watch the SF channel, but this show was simply too good to dismiss. Recommended.",1169769600,40,871,4.8133333333333335
2737139,4,B000MMMTD2,"LOST ROOM is an intriguing, thought-provoking science fiction mini-series which was shown on the Sci-Fi Channel from December 11th to the 13th in three parts: ""The Key and the Clock,"" ""The Comb and the Box,"" & ""The Eye and the Prime Object."" This show offers up a neat-concept, sci-fi mystery that'll keep you guessing and glued to the set; and the good news, so far, is that there's nary a mention of that played-out plot about space aliens conducting experiments on unsuspecting Earthlings, a card which I was half-expecting this show to play.

Here we go now with TONS OF SPOILERS: In the 1960s, a mysterious event transpires at the Sunshine Motel in Gallup, New Mexico, off the famous Route 66. Since then, various everyday objects that had been in Room 10 of that motel - objects numbering around a hundred and now scattered to the winds - seem to have inexplicably gained vast and wondrous powers (a comb that freezes time for 10 seconds when run thru one's hair, a pen that, when clicked, microwaves your enemies, a radio which, when tuned to the right station, grants 3 inches of height, a deck of cards which will disable onlookers, a nail file which induces sleep, etc.). A belief circulating underground is that a grouping of these objects will cause them to exhibit new properties and grant their owner god-like powers, even possibly allowing the owner access to the mind of God... Inevitably, over the past decades, disparate groups have sought these objects for their own varying purposes. Which then brings us to the show's protagonist: Joe Miller.

In the course of investigating a baffling case involving two men found burned to a crispy death in a pawn shop, Pittsburg homicide detective and single dad Joe Miller (Peter Krause, SPORTS NIGHT, SIX FEET UNDER) comes upon a magical motel room key which, when used on any convenient door, gives him access to an eternally sun-drenched motel room frozen in time since the 1960s. Miller discovers that, from this motel room, he can reach any destination he calls to mind. He learns of another odd quirk of the room: no matter what he does to it or in it, the room  resets itself to its original composition the next time he enters.

His digging of clues leads him to an eccentric named Wally (Peter Jacobson), who owns a bus ticket which teleports whosoever is smacked on the head with it. Wally proceeds to unload pertinent info on Miller regarding the motel room and the amazing objects which had been occupying it. Wally further informs Miller that these indestructible artifacts are drawn to each other, then warns him that people will soon come looking for him - ""bad people"" who are desperate to possess the key. Rapidly after, Miller's quest for truth finds focus tragically close to home when his charming, young daughter, Anna (Elle Fanning, Dakota's younger sis), vanishes in the mysterious Room 10.

In his efforts to find his daughter, Miller becomes hunted by his fellow police, who come to believe that he has kidnapped Anna; he also runs afoul of other organizations - various shadowy cabals, some of them despicable and ruthless, bent on collecting the items to gain incalculable powers (such as the determined Karl Kreutzfeld's group) or to talk to God (such as the nutjob Order of Reunification) and the Legion, a supposedly more benevolent group who seeks to protect humanity by destroying these items. Miller must evade the clutches of the cabals and remain vigilant against the Legion as he drastically attempts to unearth the history of the enigmatic Room 10 and the Sunshine Motel. Things get more chancy as it seems the only way to retrieve his daughter is to ferret out the Primal Object, the controlling item which holds dominion over all the other items. But which one is it? Can the aid of several quirky characters and the beautiful Jennifer Bloom (Julianna Margulies, ER), who seems to have secrets of her own, be enough for Miller to survive and gain back his daughter? Well, with the possibility of an ongoing series on the Sci-Fi Channel, I'd bet on it.

Viewers seeking a quick and easy resolution to the mystery will be disappointed here as the mini-series concludes with plenty of questions left unanswered. In fact, the last half hour of Part 3 engages more in launching new plotlines than in closing the book on existing ones... again, paving the way for a regular series. The cast is pretty darn good. Peter Krause as the desperate Joe Miller plays up just the right amounts of panicky fatherhood and resourceful detective and does it with a relatable, down-to-earth panache. Kevin Pollak plays the cold and deadly, mob-type boss, Karl Kreutzfeld, with charm and civilized vindictiveness. Pollak, a comedian turned very capable actor, makes you actually feel compassion for his character once you find out his real motivation. Sleazy operator Howard ""the Weasel"" Montague is played with zest by Roger Bart, while Elle Fanning (Dakota's younger sis) is okay as Miller's cute kid. I do feel that Julianna Margulies could've done more with her part; she seemed quite disinterested in the goings-on, but I acknowledge that her role was pretty thankless.

The powers-that-be made a good decision in allowing the involving story to become the star of the show, as opposed to bludgeoning us with multiple, flashy special effects. As it is, the effects that do pop up are nicely executed and are perfectly in tune with the story. The budget must've been nice.

As I've mentioned, this mini-series is intriguing, and part of the intrigue is that it deliberately chooses to leaves holes in its storyline. Part of whether the viewer ultimately sees this show in a positive light will depend on his or her reaction to the barrage of questions that are left unanswered. The series is wagering that the audience will be so caught up in the mystery that it ultimately chooses to support it. LOST ROOM will have those inclined thinking in philosophical and metaphysical terms, and there might be a bit of quantum physics thrown in that mix, too. And for we lesser mortals - who just aren't built towards intellectual ponderings - fear not; there is enough steady infusion of uneasy alliances, betrayals, plot twists, action, and cool f/x to satisfy our craving for low-brow entertainment. Now, I don't know how well this premise would work as a regular television series; there's a danger that things might get too predictable and stale after a few showings. I'm assuming that each episode would involve the hunt for an empowered object, and really, how many curve balls can you throw to make that consistently interesting? But wouldn't it be nifty to find out?",1168732800,100,6647,4.870910698496905

I wish it had gone a little deeper, but the surface story explores the world in enough detail and provides enough investment in the characters that it stays engaging. The writing gets a little lazy at times though, not Hallmark lazy, but there's an aesthetic around the ""The `noun`"" naming convention that gets hard to ignore and brings attention to a general disinterest in some of the details.",1483574400,,494,4.625

There is one man who learns about a lost room through the inadvertent use of one of these objects. The mystery of this room unfolds and the unexpected truth is revealed. I won't spoil it for you.

A key that opens from any door with a lock into the lost room.  Its a way to get away from ""bad guys""  but without its own consequences.  They call it an ""object"", one of many, that have special attributes such as the bus ticket that takes you to a podunk town in Texas. Fun show.",1475625600,,415,4.024390243902439

As a big sci-fi fan this is great, it has everything you want out of long story. It is has a good dose of humor, intrigue, and suspense.  In an era of TV being nothing but reboots and spin-offs this a great original idea. I will continue to enjoy this for a long time to come.",1463616000,,440,3.6808510638297873

2737174,5,B000MMMTD2,"Amazing series! Though Sci-Fi, it doesn't focus so much on the SF element, but on human relationships. It makes you wish you too could find such weird and wonderful items as the ones the heroes discover. It is not hardcore SF, for example space travel. The occurrences are described as physics  gone awry, so a small part of you says, ""well, it could happen"". The actors are excellent, the special effects and directing are very good and the characters are AMAZING! They are funny, believable and very entertaining!
We never get an explanation how that room and those objects were originally created, but it doesn't deduct anything from the enjoyment of the series. I loved how the mysterious objects become deified or demonised or simply used, depending on the user, because that's exactly how human psychology works. And it's one of those mini-series that never gets old. I can see myself watching it again in ten years from now without feeling that it's outdated or no longer entertaining or relative.
Generally speaking, it's great pity that so few people are aware of this series. I keep buying it as a gift to make it more known. Highly recommended to everyone who loves a good plot and fast dialogue, whether a SF fan or not!",1461024000,,1232,4.757009345794392

Maybe it's just too dated now (I'm reviewing this late 2015) but it just seemed like a wasted opportunity. The idea of having a key to a room that is located out of our space-time is incredibly seductive, but the execution of the idea just didn't grab me. The lead actor, Peter Krause, has very little charisma and just doesn't manage to incite much interest. The room itself contains lots of artifacts which have individual abilities but we only see them used occasionally and  only as toys rather than true implements of power. There is a cabal of (stupid) people who have enormous power under their control but seem to have no idea how to wield it. It's all just a bit of a yawn, unfortunately.

The show itself was well done and kept you interested with its numerous side stories.  A detective stumbles into a mysterious key that leads any door to a magical motel room.  It is amazing and moves to terrifying when ruthless people start pursing him for the key and then his daughter (Elle Fanning) disappears in the room when it resets every time the door is closed.

2737229,5,B000MMMTD2,"Im definitely trying to find a blu ray version of this. Excellent DVD. I still watch it from time to time from beginning to end. The quality is still passable on HD TVs and loss in picture quality is minimal on HD televisions.

I've brought this to multiple friends homes and every single one of them get mesmerized by it and tend to watch from beginning till end or borrow it. I purchased this close to 5 years ago and noticed I never reviewed it. It's pretty good that I choose to take the time and review it.

Without giving to much away. The very first episode is a little cheesy and has a typical low budget special effect with a glowing door. After that, it instantly improves. The special effects are more believable and do not look low budget. The gist of the film

(I am making this vague to avoid ruining anything. But everything written in this review is said in the first 2 episodes).

A cop comes across a key that when inserted into any door opens a doorway to a random location anywhere in the world. It has to be a physical door that a key can be inserted, not a sliding door or electronic keyless door. They find out that any place you concentrate to the door will open on the other end. An example, bathroom door at a bar and it opens to the inside of your home if you concentrate on it..Basically you can go anywhere as long as you have a visualization of it. If not, it opens in a random location. The story expands into a huge chase not tied into him looking for his daughter but these objects. There are multiple unbreakable objects similar to the door that posses abstract effect. The key being one and many others unknown. A comb that when used on a head of hair makes the person invisible by freezing the world around them but makes you sick the longer you freeze time. A ticket that for some unknown reason teleports the person to a specific location every time. This indicates the objects have a specific use or trying to tell the user something.

This is not just just a sci fi related story, there is a mystery, and one of the goals is saving his daughter who enters a room using the key, but accidently gets the door shut on her sending her into alternate dimension where she may or may not be dead. This leads the cop into searching for a away to open the location his daughter was lost in but is clueless where she went which leads him to wild chase. What makes the story interesting isn't just the supernatural items, the acting, plot and multiple things going on at once.. There are groups of people trying to locate the items to use it to benefit themselves, religious cults who believe the objects belong to god, and others trying to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. This is not just a 1 dimensional story. There are multiple things going on and agendas that keeps you interested in wanting to find out the end. If you want something new a fresh, this a must buy. I still love it and its a shame they never made more episode of it...",1415750400,,2984,4.321428571428571

2737246,4,B000MMMTD2,"This was a Sci-Fi Channel original miniseries before that network became a dumping for crappy B-grade movies like Sharktopus.

The basic premise is that a detective stumbles into a world featuring mysterious and powerful ""Objects"" and the various people that are seeking them. The Objects come from a motel room that was transformed by a mysterious ""Event"" that caused the room to drop out of the normal universe and imbued the various mundane items that were in there at the time with strange, powerful, or useless supernatural abilities.

Peter Krause gives a good performance of Detective Joe Miller, a worldly cop thrust into a rather unworldly situation, and Kevin Pollack gives a decent performance as the series' primary antagonist, Karl Krutzfeld.

The series is only six episodes long, and the DVD contains a few extras. It looks pretty good in spite of its relatively low budget, and overall the story works pretty well. There's some pretty good dialogue and moments of subtle comedy, even if the overall storyline is somewhat cliched. The exact nature of ""the Event"" is never explained, and I'm not sure if that was an artistic choice or they left it open-ended because the creators thought it was going to kick-start a longer series.",1399593600,3,1245,5.004830917874396
2737247,4,B000MMMTD2,"This television series had a unique concept.  Sometime in 1961, if I remember correctly, some both devastating and unexplained event took place in Room 10 of a little motel somewhere in New Mexico.

Whatever the event, artifacts in the room took on unique and unexplained characteristics.  For example, pointing the scissors at a person and twisting the wrist would send the person aimed at flipping on their head.

Joe ends up with ""the key"", a highly sought after item which enables the user to open any door lock and enter any place they think of.  Unfortunately, if you do NOT think of a place you end up in a limbo-like existence in the now missing from the motel, Room 10.  That is exactly what happens to Joe's daughter, Anna.  Joe spends the rest of the series trying to retrieve her from limbo.

2737266,4,B000MMMTD2,"The Lost Room was the second Sci-fi Channel miniseries that truly redefined the sci-fi genre for television (after the Battlestar reboot), with the other miniseries being The Triangle. With The Lost Room, follow Detective Joe Miller as a murder investigation turns into a quest to keep the universe from unraveling when he discovers a key that has the ability to unlock every door. But this is not the only ""Object"" with extraordinary powers, and it did not come to be by chance. He's also not the only one trying to solve the giant puzzle of the ""Objects"" as shadowy figures and religious fanatics are also out to get the key, and dozens of other ""Objects.""

The Lost Room was and is a fantastically entertaining miniseries, with good acting, visuals and a haunting musical theme that will stick with you even after you finish the final episode. The Scifi Channel (now known as Syfy) has a few great TV shows, some decent ones, and limitless God-awful movies, but it always seems that the miniseries' they develop always turn out to be the best. Maybe it's because they invest the most time building the story, moving characters around and creating a memorable climax. Either way, if you love science fiction, some witty/goofy comedy and mystery, The Lost Room is perfect for you. It is TV, so do not expect Leonardo DiCaprio/Denzel Washington high-end acting, but acting from a highly entertaining and well-made blockbuster. The writing is outstanding too, having twists and turns you definitely would not see coming. There isn't much I want to talk about the show because it reveals too much, but I will say, add it to your collection.

The downside of The Lost Room, is the formatting they used when they released it on disc. The same thing happened with the incredible Taye Diggs TV show, ""Daybreak."" Poor video quality and sub-par audio; definitely poor distribution. Hopefully one day in the future someone gets these shows released on a truly wonderful Blu-Ray format.

2737268,5,B000MMMTD2,"This series was a nerdy delight. The characters are done well, the plot is original, and seeing how the objects worked was always entertaining. This show is argued by many to be a precursor to Warehouse 13 as far as premise and scope, and I would have to agree to an extent. However, I feel this would have been a great stand alone series as they left the options very wide open with tons of options to pursue the many items that were still left a mystery. When the series launched, they had an interactive webpage that you could track items with, see properties and powers of many of them, and it seemed they were gearing this up to become a full blown series, but for whatever reason, just never came to fruition.  This is another one of the lost gems of T.V. that may never get its due. (I am looking at you Firefly.)

So if you are a fan of WH13, well written and witty Sci-Fi, and yearn for something outside the ""reality"" shows and daytime dramas, pick this one up and enjoy, just be careful what you pick up.",1375747200,,1015,4.28125
2737269,4,B000MMMTD2,"To borrow a phrase from Warehouse 13 (season 4), ""Holy Metaphor!""  But metaphors are needed when talking about soul recovery.  The lost room (a person) functions at a basic level as it has plumbing, electricity and a bed (the person is physically alive) but 100 items from the room (feelings), which a person needs to feel most comfortable and satisfied while in it, are missing (1(00) is a number for wholeness).  In other words, the lost room represents a feeling of emptiness or a missing felt sense of self or perhaps burn out/loss of soul (the protagonist's young daughter goes missing in relation to the room and the series revolves around getting her back.)

Each item or object has a specific function and location in the room (organs and muscles store feelings).  Our protagonist, played by Peter Krause, has the mind and courage and ""the key"" (correct attitude) to get her back (and save himself) while others serve as cautionary tales of the risks involved in either trying to do too much alone or in seeking the power of love/spirit for the wrong reasons.  The scene with the two one-eyed men entering the room, disappearing and out appearing the young daughter after re-opening the door seems to be a portrayal of integrating the two sides of a person (love and contempt).

2737290,5,B000MMMTD2,"One of the freshest concepts I had seen in a very, very, very long time. Completely unexpected and fantastically wild - exposing and exploring a tantalizingly bizarre world that lay just beyond normal perception. Was genuinely stunned it didn't produce a full-fledged tv program given the amazing quality of the mini-series.

Opens as a homicide officer investigates a series of unusual deaths. And after an exhaustive investigation with no reasonable explanation, Detective Joe Miller and his partner are completely baffled; the crime scene unlike anything they've ever encountered. There's only one clue and it saddens him to admit it.

The lone eyewitness is a kid he helped earlier in his career, a kid he thought he had straightened out. The same young man who literally vanished into thin air no more than an arm's length away from his grasp during an interrogation. And despite repeatedly watching surveillance video of himself and the witness - the veteran cop still can't fathom how he just disappeared.

Needing a break after such a strange day, Joe just wants to unwind at home with his little girl. Regardless of being away due to work, he makes a huge effort to spend time with his young daughter, Anna. Suddenly, stumbling out of the pantry and already dying from several gunshot wounds, is the young man who vaporized from the police station earlier that day.

He came out of their pantry.

Stunned beyond words that the suspect has just reappeared at their dinner table, he instructs Anna to go to her room and hide until he gives her the all-clear. Trying to comfort the obviously dying man, Joe hears his final words. But what he says is impossible.

The key he is carrying will open any door in existence. Any door. Just like the one next to their dining room.

By itself a pretty startling statement, but the detective is about to discover that it's only the tip of a massively twisted iceberg.

Once used, the key will initially open to a very special place, an intermediate way-station that looks like a plain and sparse motel room in the middle of the New Mexican desert. And, if you don't have the key, is the last place you will ever see. Because without it in your possession, you're erased from existence. Forever.

Suddenly Anna is kidnapped. Her captors know he has the key and they want to make a trade. And truthfully, as much as Joe wants to understand the freakish sequence of events that have exploded into his life - he will do anything for his little girl. Anything. Quickly an agreement is made for the exchange. Unfortunately, through a series of missteps, Anna runs back into the motel room to hide - without the key. Horrified, Joe screams at her to stop. A literal second passes, but it's already too late.

She's gone.

Desperate beyond words, Joe uses a lifetime of detective skills to penetrate and expose the hidden world inhabited by secret societies, twisted cults, quirky characters and powerful dark individuals - all of whom will do whatever it takes to obtain a group of seemingly innocuous objects. A pair of eyeglasses, a nail file, a pack of playing cards, a wristwatch, etc. From across the globe, almost 100 in total, these objects have been lost, found, purchased, stolen, re-stolen, fought over, killing and killed over, with an endless body count attached to each one.

They're notable for two things. First, they're totally indestructible. Second, they each have a special power; some benign, others so dangerous as to be considered weapons of mass destruction. Made even more fearful when used in combination with one another. These objects will lead Joe to something that's somewhere between amazing and terrifying at the crossroads of reality.

Questions remaining after the mini-series concluded are multitude.

Did, as some believe, God himself stay at the motel room? Did his power transfer to the objects upon his death? If not, what are they? And most terrifying - what happens if one person or group successfully reunites all the objects? Questions that, unfortunately, will never be answered in an official canon. Technically, after the series ended, the rights to produce further content were picked up by an independent comic publisher who announced they would continue the story - but they haven't moved on the project in over six years, with no sign that they will resume. Sad.

A powerful and completely engrossing tale that unfortunately ends much too soon.

As the story proceeds, the history of the Lost Room and the Objects obtain a depth and resonance that is amazing, in such a short series. I recommend the series unconditionally.

This DVD, though, is disappointing. The menu and episode navigation is very awkward, to the point that it discourages me from showing this series to others. I always feel like I need to apologize to my friends before booting up the disc. It lacks polish.

Still, having said that, the tale of Joe Miller, his daughter and the Key is outstanding.",1344038400,2,699,4.816666666666666
2737296,4,B000MMMTD2,"OK, I can be honest on this part - I got this because of Julianna Margulies. I love her work, even though she doesn't seem to be all that popular with others. I just don't think she has had the right parts, but I loved her in ER, even though the writers did her what I considered to be a nasty soap opera turn. Be that as it may, I really enjoyed ""The Lost Room"" for it's eerie turn. Not a ghost story, and nonsensical in many ways, it harks back in a way to an old Twilight Zone episode, where child falls out of bed, rolls under, and winds up in a nasty alternate world (""Little Girl Lost"" Season 3, Episode 91, March 16, 1962. The story draws from that whole ""Twilight Zone zeitgeist, being based upon items originally owned by a 1961 traveling salesman. A salesman who, while staying in a remote motel room along Route 66 (an dusty desert road at the time), suffers an extraordinary event. An event which turns the items in his possession into items of spectacular power. A power which, of course, the rich and powerful would do anything to lay their hands upon.

Part camp, part homage to ""The Twilight Zone"", this tiny series reminds me in a way of a video game - resetting itself each time you enter the room. This isn't a story about the actors, but a story about the story, one which leaves you with as many questions as it answers.

All in all, highly enjoyable. It seems to have been the beginning of a series which never got off the ground, which is a shame, as the conceptualization is quite interesting, and I go back to it in my DVR collection quite often. If you like stories that are not all tied up in a tidy little bow, and make you think, try it out. You might just like it!",1342396800,3,1694,4.2253086419753085

2737299,4,B000MMMTD2,"This was one of the most consistently satisfying and engrossing miniseries I'd seen in a long time, whether sci-fi or otherwise. It has been mentioned otherwise about how entertaining motel/hotel stories are, whether ""Identity"" or ""1408"" or even ""Vacancy,"" but ""The Lost Room"" really seems to be unique -- I certainly don't recall seeing anything else quite like it. The story is very intriguing and very well written, the dialogue is believable and doesn't come across as stilted or unreal (in spite of the very surreal quality surrounding the events and the ""objects"" of the tale). Admittedly, there aren't a lot of unexpected twists or turns or similar ""gotcha""-style plot devices, but it's because there don't need to be. The action consistently stands on its own and moves along at excellent pacing; the theme of the story is bizarre enough in its own right without resorting to gimmicks to keep the viewer's attention.

I thought the casting was well-done, too -- although the acting is mostly very good, no character stands out in such a way as to overshadow the rest, except perhaps the Joe Miller character (very ably and likably played by Peter Krause), but in a way this all makes sense. This is a tale of ordinary men and women caught up in the midst of an extraordinary state of existence that has somehow overlapped into reality as we know it, and the players all carry it off convincingly. I especially liked the supporting performances by Kevin Pollak (a little different sort of role than I'm used to seeing him in -- both threatening and at the same time sympathetic), Dennis Christopher (who does a nice representation of gradually going nuts), and Peter Jacobsen (who does already-half-nuts in very amusing fashion). I was actually a bit disappointed in the role written for Julianna Margulies -- it isn't particularly strong, and you almost get the sense that, other than characterizing the existence of The Legion, she could almost have not been in the story at all and it would have continued on as before. Margaret Cho, on the other hand, has some fun scenes as a sort of one-person eBay of the abstruse.

Aside from the main story thread, what adds flavor to the goings-on are the ""objects"" themselves -- the everyday items that have become, in this reality, artifacts of strange powers ranging from mundanely miraculous to uniquely dangerous, even lethal. I kept wondering to myself, ""How did someone deliberately discover that a particular object sublimates brass? brings memories into tangible existence by swallowing it? lowers blood pressure when its worn?"" There must have been some pretty creative research going on during most of the items' existences.

Again, a very well-imagined, well-crafted miniseries. I've seen a number of folks here wonder about whether this is going to be a regular series on SciFi. I found that it was the perfect length, with a good ending that makes sense, and I'm a little bit glad they don't seem to be trying to stretch it into anything longer. I thought ""The Lost Room"" ended just where it was supposed to, though others will probably disagree. Give this one a look; it's definitely thinking-man's sci-fi without the need for elaborate special effects and exotic locations to keep things interesting.",1328832000,2,3266,4.956204379562044

2737301,4,B000MMMTD2,"In my search for TV gold that I missed along the way, I happened upon this series. It was a failure for the Sci Fi channel.  More's the pity. While it was left wide open for a sequel or a second series, Sci Fi left it alone because of how poorly it was received.  NOTE: If you are watching it, and it seems as though some ideas behind the Lost Room seem to be cloned from Warehouse 13, just remember that the Lost Room came first.

I won't go into details; plenty of other reviewers have done that, and it doesn't bear repeating.

What did I like?  It was different, in that it had a reasonably original idea, and turned it into a mystery and a thriller, with some inexplicable (and thankfully unexplained) strange and bizarre events.  Too much explanation easily can ruin a genre story--just look at every Star Trek series iteration from Next Generation onward.  Many of the characters were decently drawn, and the acting was quite good, in most cases.

What didn't I like? A few of the characters were a bit too 2-dimensional.  One early villain was a caricature of bad guys, which made him quite annoying.  The big bad had more depth, fortunately. Peter Kraus played the main character, Joe Miller. He wasn't terrible, but I think he played it a bit too understated. Some of the things he saw and did would have left most people catatonic or screaming, at least until they could adjust. But he seemed to adapt just a bit too quickly to the bizarre reality. Once past that, he did make a credible cop and a reasonable father. I think a stronger lead would have made the show better.

Conclusion: Same as the first paragraph. I enjoyed its original ideas; I liked its imagination.  Overall, I thought it was a well-executed tale and I both enjoyed and recommend it. I think it would have worked better if it hadn't had such a happy-for-all ending, as it didn't quite fit the tenor of the show.  The loose ends it left were quite acceptable--everything doesn't always have to be tied up in a neat, Hollywood-shaped bow.  Also, if you prefer your genre shows light and sometimes fluffy, stick with Warehouse 13.",1322870400,2,2110,4.532981530343008

Such a shame that this great show had to end so poorly.  I would highly recommend this to anyone if it was not for the terrible ending.  As it is, unless you don't mind watching a show with some great ideas that leaves you feeling as though everything is unresolved, then you might still enjoy this.

Certainly there are parts where the viewer will be confused, but not to the point of frustration, as many series do.

Either way, I believe anybody who can enjoy a good story that doesn't involve pools of blood, genetically mutated Raptor-hamsters, Aliens coming to harvest us, etc, will find this a great watch!

Best review I can give?
My wife wanted to watch the last episode of this product before catching up on her soaps!",1295827200,,1080,4.73936170212766
2737322,4,B000MMMTD2,"This was ""recommended"" on my DVD rental account.  I'm not a big science fiction fan but I was intrigued by the synopsis of the series so I added it to my queue.  My 14 year old son and I had planned to watch the series over a two night period but we were hooked after watching the first DVD so we just had to watch the whole series!

We felt it was very interesting and I liked the characters. It was eerie yet had some comic relief in a few spots and the ""objects"" powers were creative. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that the ending was a disappointment.  I initially thought I had missed something so I re-watched the part where the old timer was explaining how his wife went missing.

Just today I decided to read the reviews here and found out that this was originally supposed to be a TV series but had not received enough viewers so there was a rush to make an ending.  It did indeed leave me with questions such as: How did that room get there?  Why did the objects have powers?  It would be nice if they would resurrect it to add a better explanation.  I mean, they brought ""V"" back.

Regarding the DVD itself, it was annoying that the menu did not work properly and we were forced to either watch the movie trailers or, like me, fast forward though it.  Still, I have already recommended it to several friends and family members for its great concept!",1294099200,3,1388,4.21969696969697

2737335,5,B000MMMTD2,"This is an excellent and engaging mini-series that appears to be a pilot for a TV series that was never picked up by a network. The Lost Room has great and likable characters, top-notch writing and an engrossing plot centered around a room in a motel that is somehow disconnected from regular space and time. All the elements in that room have paranormal attributes that allow the possessor specific powers or abilities, such as stopping time for a few seconds (the comb), being able to unlock any door and go out through any other door anywhere on the planet (the key), overwhelmingly paralyzing people (the deck of cards), suspending all electrical or mechanical functioning of machines (the eyeglasses), the ability to flip and twist people into the air (the scissors), etc.

There are more than 30 different everyday objects in the room, all with different attributes or powers, and combinations of 2 or more provide an exponential number of effects that can be created. All this gives potential for YEARS of episodes. While I loved the mini-series, I was bummed that it was never turned into a full-blown TV series. It could have run for at least 5 years, and I'd have watched every episode.

The DVD is definitely worth buying and can be watched several times through without becoming tiresome. Character development is very well done, and the acting is first-rate. You quickly start to care what happens to the main characters, and this is the best measure of a well-done series.

Highly recommended for mystery, sci-fi and suspense movie lovers. My only complaint is that the series was too short.",1271116800,,1605,4.893382352941177

This series was amazing, the characters are great, the story is great I would love to see this continued.

2737339,5,B000MMMTD2,"Just got through the first disc and if the second is even half as good it'll still be worth the ride.

The Lost Room has all the key ingredients of an award winning show: great premise, great cast (headed by Peter Krause of Six Feed Under fame), and great writing. The supporting actors were clever, watchable, and real...even antagonists like the Weasel (e.g. ""You couldn't have got a cordless?!?!"") were a treat. I thought Julianna Margulies was a bit underutilized but that just allowed all the focus to be on Krause. Also, I've seen a tendency of sci-fi shows to get carried away with adding powers or cast (e.g. Heroes, 4400) and lose cohesiveness. Thus far, Lost Room has stuck to the rules/boundaries it originally set; the writers don't ""spring"" new characters or modify powers just to suit the story.

I find it both a shame and a blessing that this show wasn't made into a series. It's a shame because there are apparently a lot of unanswered questions at the end of the miniseries. That said, I have doubts how well this show would have translated into a weekly series. It would have been a travesty if this show had degenerated into a Heroes or 4400 (my apologies to any diehard fans reading this). So yes, it is a downer that the show didn't have a ""proper"" ending but it was still a good show nonetheless. Plus I've gotten used to abrupt endings to great shows: Dead Like Me, Carnivale, etc.

Note that none of the reviews were negative with respects to the actual story line etc.  My problem, and my question is where did the segment regarding the glass eye and the visit to the vault to retrieve the glass eye disappear to?  It was not on my video and I am wondering if other viewers missed it as well.  To someone who did not see the series in its entirety on TV this is a crucial segment in understanding the ending. Perhaps I just have a defective DVD, or perhaps I am running into one of the DVD issues previously noted by earlier reviewers.

The quality that went into the making of this DVD was seriously lacking.  The menu system doesn't work.  You can't choose to just play the whole thing, you have to choose to play each segment of this miniseries and half the time when you try to navigate the menus they don't work.

2737352,4,B000MMMTD2,"About the mini-series itself, pitch-perfect. Intriguing from beginning to end. They did leave a few questions unanswered not the least of which was what caused the incident in the early 1960's in the first place but they had made the mini-series with a possible future weekly series in mind so they couldn't answer everything. It may be too late but it would be nice if Sci-Fi could do a follow up mini-series to wrap up those loose ends. The effects were great, there were stand out performances by the lead actor and actress but the secondary actors were so fantastic as well, especially Dennis Christopher and Kevin Pollack. Overall this mini series was a cut above Sci-Fi/Horror quicky movies the Sci-Fi channel usually makes. No offense Sci-Fi channel, but that's true.
Now about the dvd itself. It comes as a two disc set, which you'd expect for a mini-series, but unfortunately on disc one it appears they did a little too much compression and the picture suffers, but only slightly. There are many minutes of ads at the beginning that are difficult to navigate past. Also navigation on the menu is a little frustrating. These are the reasons I gave it four stars instead of five. Not because there is anything wrong with the production itself, which there isn't.
There is also a nice little behind the scenes featurette at the end of disc two. Which could have been longer and included more details of this facinating series.
Despite my kibizting, I highly recommend viewing this series to anyone who hasn't experienced the world of the ""Objects"".

This is an update on July 26, 2011- There has been talk of a possible comic book follow up to the mini-series, but so far it's only been talking and nothing has been published.

2737354,5,B000MMMTD2,"This is hands down one of the best sci-fi shows I've ever seen. It was a mini-series on the Sci-Fi channel that was originally intended to become a complete series, but for whatever reason it stopped short of that goal. I completely discovered it by accident, just happened to walk past it in a video rental store and it caught my eye, and I'm so glad I did. The imagination was excellent, the existential questions it poses were thought provoking and the overall writing was superb. All the actors did an excellent job, and surprisingly they're mostly nobodies in terms of fame, except for Kevin Pollak and Julianna Margulies, but I think that helped make it even greater because there are virtually no expectations going into this film, so I was pleasantly surprised, perhaps more so than by any other movie/TV show in recent memory. I saw it about a year ago or so but it's stayed in my mind this whole time.  I still find myself thinking about it from time to time, which says a great deal about this show's quality and longevity.  It's rare that I think about a show that often, and it only happens when something truly exceptional comes along.  I own the DVD and several friends of mine who I've introduced it to absolutely love it. There's significant character depth, which is a major plus in my book, and the story goes where you really don't expect it to, which I love, more or less completely unpredictable.  There are almost constant twists and turns, but they're pleasant surprises, and just when you think you've got it figured out, another element comes along that throws a wrench into the wheel and you're left fumbling trying to regain your focus.  It keeps you on your toes and exercises your brain in an unusual but positive way, and that's a precious gift.

It's rather ironic considering that the Sci-Fi channel produced it, because more often than not they make nothing but garbage, but this one stands out, it went above and beyond the vast majority of sci-fi shows, so if you're a fan of the genre, you owe it to yourself to see it.

2737359,5,B000MMMTD2,"I loved this Sci Fi Channel miniseries.  I'm going to write a few spoilers pertaining to the show's setup to help you decide if you want to buy this.  Please don't read on if you don't want any spoilers.

First of all, it's Science Fiction but set in the real world with the flavor of a cop show.  The major premise of the show is that a cop finds a key that causes any door the key is used on to open to Room #10 of the Sunshine hotel as the room appeared in 1961, outside of Gallup New Mexico.  So, you walk up to the door in your house but instead of using your key, you use this special key, and viola! the door opens to this room that is lost in time.  Inside the room, it looks like its 1961 in the middle of the day, on a bright sunny day.  You get the ebbie jeebies when you look at the room - it was very well done by Sci Fi.  The room only has one door.  The story does not explore what happens if you try to break a window and step into this weird world that the key opens or anything like that.  When you go to leave the room, the door opens to whatever place you're thinking of that has a room.  So you can travel across the globe by going through the lost room.  With me so far?  One more thing, the room resets everytime anybody leaves with the key... that is to say if you walk in and leave your coat, if you come back, the coat will be gone, apparently lost, forever.

Ok, well the room apparently was originally outfitted with everything that would typically be in an occupied 1960s style hotel room like a clock, a pen, clothes, comb, etc.  Over the years, apparently, the people who have used the special key to this lost room have removed many of these typical items.  The items appear to have special and just plain ""weird"" powers in the real world and the items, known as objects, are indistructible in the real world.  For example, a bus ticket has the effect of transporting anyone who comes into contact with it to Gallup New Mexico in today's world and the bus pass is impossible to tear up or destroy.  The comb, appears to stop time for a few seconds while the person runs the comb through their hair.  Etc, etc.  If you take an object into the lost room with your lost room key, and leave it in there, when the room resets, the object reverts back to where it was in 1961.  Objects can be destroyed once in the room but when the room resets, a new similar object will appear to replace it.

With me so far...pretty out there.  In the real world, at the Sunshine Motel, there is no room #10 only 9 rooms in the motel.

Again, the story has a cop finding the lost room key.  The cop is an average Joe who would probably think this whole lost room and key thig is interesting and the story probably wouldn't have progressed beyond that.  However, accidentally, his daughter winds up in the lost room and the door closes on her and when he goes back into the lost room with the key the room has reset and his young daughter is lost.

This sends our poor cop on a quest to find out as much as he can about the lost room and the mysterious objects in an effort to save his daughter.  I won't spoil it from there but suffice it to say that he winds up finding all kinds of weird things like cults surrounding the lost room and the mysterious objects.

All kinds of theories float around in the show about how the room came to be lost in time/space/another dimension etc.  One of the best things to me about this show is that they don't explain everything about the room or the objects or what happened.  This is mostly a cop show about a man trying to save his daughter under some decidedly weird circumstances and against bands of people who act weird because they're mostly obsessed with the objects and the lost room.

I found it a very entertaining miniseries and it would be great if they made at least another miniseries surrounding this premise/concept.  If you suspend disbelief and enjoy cop shows, this is a wonderfully entertaining miniseries.  I hope this helps you make a decision.",1230681600,3,4017,4.228346456692913

Allow me to put forth a theory surrounding The Event in the story, which is reported to have occured on May 4, 1961 at 1:20pm. This falls about the time it has been speculated that the US government was reverse-engineering the craft recovered from the Roswell Incident. Since it has also been speculated that its drive system involved some form of space-time warp, could the tampering with this advance technology have triggered The Event?",1226361600,,498,5.0
2737369,4,B000MMMTD2,"I'm not going to elaborate on why this is a great miniseries. Many other reviewers have done that exceedingly well. But I am going to complain about the ending.

Some reviewers have implied or stated that the weakness of the ending comes from the unresolved plot lines which may serve as the basis for a series. I agree that those unresolved plot lines can be considered by many to be a weakness. But those unresolved plot lines are not the basis of my complaint about the ending - I'm fine with any number of unresolved plot lines. The real problem with the last episode is that is is simply very weak-it fails to show the creativity, ingenuity, or intelligence of the rest of the series. I'm not going to go into any detail because I don't want to give anything away, but that last episode fails to hold up the high standards of the rest of the mini series. So as you are watching this amazing series and you are heading for the end, expecting that the ending will be on the same level as everything else, be ready for a disappointment because it isn't. The ending is certainly not horrible, nothing like the ending in the Ninth Gate-possibly the worst ending of any movie ever, but it just isn't very smart or even very interesting.",1224979200,,1235,4.464601769911504

I liked this show so much after renting it, I bought this as a gift for my father who has since bought it for others as gifts.

This is not your standard turn on and check out show.  This is definately a make you think about everyday life and take notice of the most minute detail of your everyday goings-on.

2737371,5,B000MMMTD2,"I loved this mini-series! It was one of the FEW things I found worth watching that Sci-Fi Channel ever self-produced. It worked because they put a big budget into it. THIS would've worked on ANY of the mainstream networks because I've shown it to people who are uninterested in any sort of Science Fiction and yet these people enjoyed it and said they'd have liked to have seen a series, it's THAT good. Most said it reminded them of a Twilight Zone type of episode.

My favorite points in the show are:

- 'The Key' that opens any door and gives you a safe-haven in a pocket universe

- the quest to find 'the Vault' - reminded me of a sort of modern day LotR quest if you will

- when Wally uses 'The Bus Ticket' and keeps sending the Detective Joe Miller back to old house just outside of Gallup, NM

- the various factions vying for the Objects such as the Legion and The Order who took over after the Collectors nearly destroyed themselves

- and you just have to feel for the bad guy Kreutzfeld whose son has leukemia and why he uses 'The Quarter' object

I wonder if you could remove the telephone from the room, would it have a power too? Same with the pillows or the coat hangers in the closet. The show never answers any of those questions.

Folks, if you like good cop drama mixed with some old fashioned Whodunnit and also like some Twilight Zone unexplained phenomena from the X-Files, then THIS is the show for you.

Sadly, Elle Fanning did not get good lines because the writers did not give her much to say or do. The part where she's testing the room with her dad and almost throws a fit when he picks up her favorite stuffed toy is priceless.

One of the biggest questions that befuddles me is why didn't she just think of where she wanted to go and open the door?",1224806400,,1782,4.2925373134328355

Having said that, its biggest weakness was its ending.  They took the time to build this big mystery, and it all comes to a sudden and confusing ""hollywood ending"".  Partly this was because they were clearly setting up a series, such as when David Lynch had to slap that crashland ending onto the end of the ""Twin Peaks"" pilot.  It's too bad it looks as though the series won't happen.

There were other inconsistencies and silliness here and there, but these are nits.  This is still a solid piece of storytelling, and it still has me imagining possible new plots and twists weeks after first watching it.",1223856000,2,795,4.759124087591241

2737374,2,B000MMMTD2,"If you're the sort of person who likes puzzles in a movie strictly for their own sakes, then you may find worth in The Lost Room. The production values are good -- video is a little soft on focus, but otherwise it is pretty to look at. The dialog and acting are reasonably good.

This series reminds me a bit of last year's Journeyman series on NBC. It sets the main character in a sort of ridiculous situation -- jumping through time, but not randomly. Seemingly there was a purpose behind it. A purpose seemed evident, and some sort of mechanism was hinted at but never resolved. In the end, you have a fantastical premise, with characters doing their best to resolve problems within the strange situation they faced.

In the Lost Room, characters are not jumping through time, but into some other dimension and back to normality. Many devices exist that have  fantastical qualities, used for good or ill by various factions. Two of the characters want to retrieve their lost children. One group has quasi-religious motives in obtaining these devices. Another faction wants to sequester the devices because they feel earth is in danger from this other dimension.

In the end, the personal drama of the main character is resolved. The ultimate questions about why these devices exist, who made them, and whether they represent an existential danger or a potential blessing to humanity are not resolved. If you can live with that ambiguity, you may enjoy the personal drama. For myself, I can't say that was enough to justify the four plus hours spent watching the series. I was hooked enough to want to see the end, but having seen it, I feel let down.

Mr. T would just say, ""Ain't got time for no jibber-jabber!""

Shakespeare would say, "" ...like a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""

The Lost Room is not idiotic. But it surely does signify nothing.",1222819200,4,1886,4.714285714285714
2737375,4,B000MMMTD2,"Well, Sci-Fi made a good series here.  I've watched it twice now and am still just as intrigued as the first time I saw it.

Suggestion to anyone who actually wants to see this film - don't read the lengthy reviews here which catalog the entire plot.  Like Twilight Zone, half the fun of the series is trying to figure out what is going on and making discoveries in time with the cast.

So what can I tell you about it WITHOUT giving the plot away?  Well, basically this is a mystery movie - and a bit of a quest movie, a supernatual movie, a light-hearted morality tale - guess it's kind of in a class on it's own.  More importantly, I found it to be a highly entertaining, engaging series.  Even at the end, you still have plenty of questions (which for once is intriguing rather than annoying).  That, in and of itself, is worth watching it for.

So, symantics that make the movie great (yes, I'm trying very hard not to give away the story line).

Cast - Very Good.

Only recognized 2 of them with a few vague memory joggers, but maybe you'll have more luck.  Leads are:  Peter Krause, Elle Fanning, Chris Bauer, April Grace, Dennis Christopher, Julianna Margulies, Kevin Pollak, Jason Douglas, Peter Jacobson, Ewen Bremner, Roger Bart, Chris McCarty, Margaret Cho, Jason Antoon, Hugo Perez, Tim Guinee.  The acting was really down-to-earth, funny when it called for it, genuinely sad or manic when called for.  Pretty good portrayal of normal people dealing with abnormal phenomenon.

Writing - Excellent.

Characterizations were wonderful.  Again, because they kept the tone realistic instead of focusing on the supernatural, you have both a cast of characters, and a ""cast"" of inanimate objects, all of which have stories you can identify with easily.  I like the fact that inanimate objects had a life of their own.  That's incredibly difficult to do and this show does it well - you feel curiosity, sometimes disgust - and of course the best part is, you can't help wondering what YOU would do with one of these items and wondering what the rest do.

Directing/Lighting/Creative -  Very Good

The 3D in this film was subtle and engaging.  Some new effects I haven't seen and all done in an understated manner that rarely, if ever, overwhelmed the plot or action.  You took a lot of it for granted because it was combined with excellent lighting, sets and physical effects.  Directing - I'm not an expert, but as the pace of these shows really moved while maintaing and ever deepening mystery AND while giving a ton of background information, I'd have to say it was pretty good.

So, if you like a new kind of mystery with a unique plot line and being involved in a movie (without being overwhelmed by deep questions, just tickled by them), this is a good watch.",1222041600,3,2770,4.6460905349794235

2737388,5,B000MMMTD2,"This is a great (and amazing) science fiction mini-series that will keep you glued to your seat. It has many twists, and one can only guess at where the story is really going.

A mysterious event at the Sunshine Motel (which we do not witness) caused ordinary things in Room 10 to transform into indestructible objects with extraordinary powers. For example, a bus ticket can teleport a person; a pen can melt a person; a comb can stop time; an eye can vaporize a person; a perfume bottle can suffocate a person; a deck of cards disables people...and the key that opens doors, and teleports a person from one place to another.

Some believe these objects are a piece of God, and that by collecting all of them (there are thought to be some 100 objects) one can talk with God. Some form a religion based on that belief. Is this movie telling us that religions are manmade? Did we in the distant past formed religions on circumstances we could not understand and comprehend? Was religion formed in order to understand the unexplained?

The story gets really interesting when the detective's daughter steps into a room opened y the Key, and disappears. When her father finally finds the Sunshine Motel, there are only 9 rooms--room 10 does not exist. However, room 10 can be seen through a Polaroid picture, another object of room 10. The occupant is also seen, but I won't spoil the story for you.

This is a very entertaining mini-series that I highly recommend to all sci-fi fans. The series is only 284 minutes long, which is not long enough to really develop the story and answer the many questions one is left with at the conclusion of the series.

2737395,4,B000MMMTD2,"The key to room 10 of the Sunshine Motel is highly unusual for a couple of reasons. One, there is no room 10. Two, it seems to fit into any standard doorknob with a tumbler lock. And three, when you use the key to open the door, it takes you into a motel room--room 10 of the Sunshine Motel, which doesn't exist. The motel room is pretty strange, too; for quite a lot of reasons actually, but what you first learn about it is that when you leave the room, it takes you wherever you want go.

Detective Joe Miller (Krause) comes into possession of this key as a result of his investigation into a multiple homicide at a local pawn shop. Iggy, a teenager Miller had helped out in the past, was an employee at the pawn shop and ended up with possession of the key after a deal to sell it (for a cool two million) went bad, resulting in the aforementioned homicides.

But those who were trying to buy the key are not the only ones interested in it. Shortly after Iggy escapes, he is hunted down by hired gunmen, who chase him down and shoot him...but not before he can make it to a doorway. He slips the key into the lock as the bullets enter his back, walks through the doorway, and disappears...

Only to reappear in one of the rooms of Miller's home. Though he refused to help Miller when he was brought in for questioning, when things turned ugly, Miller was the only one he could turn to for help. Fatally wounded, Iggy only has a few moments left to live upon arriving at Miller's, and with his last breaths whispers ""It opens every door,"" and then presses it into Miller's hand.

Miller, having seen Iggy use the key to disappear at the police station, later experiments with the key. Feeling foolish, he sticks the key into the lock of his closet and opens it...only to find it opening on an empty motel room. He soon after discovers the motel room's transportative properties. In the morning, as he is making breakfast, his daughter, Anna (Fanning), who witnessed him exiting the motel room the night before, experiments with the key herself, and discovers another unusual property of the room: if you place something in the room, or mess up the bed linens, then close the door and reopen it again, the room ""resets"" itself; everything goes back to the way it was before--the bed is remade, and whatever objects were thrown into the room have vanished.

This seemingly trivial point becomes much more important soon after when the man who tried to buy the key at the pawn shop, Montague (Bart), kidnaps Anna and demands that Miller give over the key for her return. In the resulting encounter, Anna, in an attempt to flee, ends up with the key and uses it to enter the motel room, only before she can enter, she loses the key to Montague. She enters the room and gets away, but is stuck inside the room when Montague uses the key to open the door again, resetting the room; so when the door opens, the motel room is as it always is, and Anna is gone.

Miller manages to reclaim the key and escape and becomes obsessed with trying to find his daughter. Starting with Montague, he begins questioning those who seem to know about the key, and soon learns that there are several other Objects, all of which originated in this mysterious motel room that the key opens doors to. One of the Objects, which is possessed by Montague, is a pen that when pressed to someone's skin cooks them from the inside out. But not all of the objects are so powerful; there's apparently a watch whose only function is that it will hardboil an egg. And there are at least two orders devoted to collecting all of these artifacts, one of which believes they are pieces of God. How or why these Objects came to exist is a mystery, as is whether or not Anna is still alive. But Miller will do whatever it takes to get his daughter back, no matter what strange and dangerous paths his investigation forces him to travel.

I'm not, in general, a big fan of miniseries. Most of the time it feels as though it's just a story that should have been pruned down to feature film length. This, however, is one of the better SF miniseries I've seen. It's not on the same level as the brilliant Battlestar Galactica miniseries, (or, to step out of genre, the highly-recommended Shogun miniseries) but it's quite enjoyable just the same. There's good acting, an inventive plot, and expert pacing, all of which serve to keep the viewer riveted throughout. And nights one and two both end on notes that should leave you eager for the next twenty-two hours to pass so you can see what happens next.

The Lost Room is by no means perfect; there are times in which the direction could have used a more accomplished hand, or the script could have used a bit more tweaking. The show boasts a terrific cast, most of whom do a fine job portraying their characters; some of the supporting cast is not quite up to par, however, and I was never really sold on the character (or the actor's portrayal) of Martin Ruber (Christopher); likewise, Bart's interpretation of Howard ""The Weasel"" Montague leaves much to be desired, and Iggy, though a very minor character, has a rather odious death scene. Again, though, I think this may come down to less than best direction.

Another thing worth mentioning--and I'm not sure if this is criticism or merely an observation--is that the plot of The Lost Room very much reminded me of a puzzle-oriented video game, such as Myst; or perhaps it would be better to compare it, considering the level of action and violence, to Resident Evil. In fact, I'd be very surprised to find out that a game based on the miniseries was not already in the preliminary stages of development, ready to be green-lit if the series is deemed a hit. This seems especially likely when you consider that the plot of The Lost Room doesn't seem like it would lend itself to sequels or continuation, and if it ends leaving such threads hanging, I think that it would be nothing less than a disappointment.

There are many parallels between The Lost Room and the ABC show Lost, least of which is the shared word in their titles. Much of The Lost Room's tension is derived from that mysterious element--there's all these strange things going on, and no one seems to know why. There's also a compelling human drama playing out at the same time, which is really what makes the miniseries so watchable. But also like Lost, The Lost Room suffers from that dreadful possibility of a letdown; you know, that feeling you get sometimes as you're watching a complicated show or film and you think ""There's no way this is all going to add up and make any sense."" Fortunately, the miniseries pulls off a satisfying ending, one that might not quite live up to the intriguing mystery that comes before it, but works nonetheless.",1188691200,5,6779,4.5220228384991845

2737398,4,B000MMMTD2,This is a great movie for any sci-fi fans. I originally saw it on the Sci-fi channel and decided to purchase it. It was much better watching it without all the commercial breaks. I recommend this to everyone.,1187136000,2,208,4.5

There are groups who help and/or hinder ... some with religious overtones or just plain violent.... depended on what they expect the room and it's contents to do for them personally.
Loved the way it ended - room for it to grow if it's picked up as a regular series .... unlike the makers of the excellent series 'Invasion' who decided to dump it completely and leave us all up in the air.
And was that Dakota Fanning's little sister in the daughters role?  What a talented family!

2737401,5,B000MMMTD2,"I give the show 5 stars, but this DVD gets 1 star.  Others have commented on the artifacting that occurs off and on thru Episodes 1-4, and it can be annoying.  The show is also not completely presented in widescreen as one would assume from the box. Episodes 1-4 are presented in fullscreen on disc 1, and episodes 5-6 are presented in widescreen on disc 2.  The previews for other Lionsgate/Sci-Fi channel shows/movies ARE however presented in widescreen on both dicsc. The difference in image quality between these two discs are astounding.  The final two episodes look great, while the first four look like 1980's TV.  Also the handy ""play all"" selection on disk one does NOT show all episodes on that disk, it simply shows all the PREVIEWS again, then drops you right back to the main menu.....But if you specifically pick only episode one to play, it plays all the episodes on disk one.  I believe the same is true of disc 2.  I tried to contact Lionsgate about this, but they do not support any sort of customer contact on their website.",1185235200,4,1043,4.605405405405405
2737402,5,B000MMMTD2,"A policeman begins working on a case and hears a rumor about a something odd that happened in the past. Apparently there was a motel room where something happened - nobody really knows what or why - and this motel room has become than a place and the things inside have become more than mere items. After a series of events he comes in contact with an item that leads to that strange room and finds that even though there are things like a pen with the ability to microwave items, the seemingly useless that do things like hardboil eggs, and even a bus ticket that lead to the middle of nowhere, he can't seem to find the most important thing ever left in the room - his daughter.
And unlocking THAT means unlocking the mysteries of The Lost Room and the items inside.

When it comes to Sci-Fi Channel miniseries, I really love watching them BUT I really don't recommend that many of them to other people. Apparently they have the ability to underfund and not poorly produce already bad scripts, and sometimes that means that the Sci-fi channel gets overlooked. When it comes to items like The Lost Room that is really a tragedy, too, because this 4-part miniseries was one that really kept me watching. Even the introduction of ""the room"" was wonderfully done - I was surprised by that one, too, because even the best series normally has a slow start - and the storyline kept you guessing. You have all these items that you really don't ""know,"" all these people with fixations on items that are sometimes mesmerizing and sometimes mortifying, and then you have the ""the room"" itself and what transpired then. I REALLY enjoyed the items and guessing their powers; sometimes the things and what they do seem useless until you see the way they are utilized and then how they all fit together. Breaking all of that down, keeping track of the macro to the micro, made for a great presentation. Combine that with surprisingly great acting, witty dialog, and people you can cheer on, and you have a mystery room worth checking into.

I HIGHLY recommend this series as something not to let get away.",1184803200,7,2092,4.590909090909091

2737407,3,B000MMMTD2,"I loved this show when I watched it on Sci-Fi last winter and was one of the first to sign up for the pre-order when it was listed.  Sadly, the DVD set has a number of technical flaws which show that Lion's Gate, the distributor, didn't do a minimal amount of testing before approving the masters.  The show comes with 6 distinct segments, one for each 'object' the show centers on.  While the Sci-Fi channel grouped these into three shows of two objects, the DVD appears to have them as 6 individual shows, allowing you to either 'play all' or watch each show separately.  But not so.  Watching the first show actually shows you the first two hours, watching the 3rd show shows you the next two hours, and watching the 5th show gives you the 5th show and 12 minutes of the 6th show.  To finish the 6th show, you then specifically chose the 6th show and rather than starting at the beginning of the 6th hour, it only shows the final 31 minutes.

The DVD defaults to English subtitles 'on' for this English speaking show and the first hour shows significant quantization errors (blocky graphics) where quick movement passes on the screen.  This is most apparent during the scene as 'Joe' talks with 'Wally' at a restaurant; first in the establishing shot as a car drives past outside, then when 'Joe' quickly pulls out the 'key' from his pocket.  I didn't notice this quantization problem in the subsequent hours.

Despite these technical faults, the quality of the show's writing and production still shine through and one hopes this is just the first set of a continuing series.  Here's hoping Lion's Gate fixes the issues for subsequent pressing of this DVD set and ensures they don't crop up on any subsequent seasons sets...",1181865600,5,1728,4.651315789473684

I was really surprised when I saw 2 episodes on tv and had to get the rest.

Only downside to the show is that its only 6 episodes and is roughly 5 hours total. Wish it had been longer and explained more of the different objects but oh well, they did what they could with only having a miniseries. The extras are slim containing only a breif but interesting input from the cast about the show, their characters, and the plot. nothing too special.

If the plot sounds at all interesting, serouisly buy this DVD it's a real treat and I can assure you that you'll watch all 6 of the episodes back to back. 15 bucks for 5 hours of an amazingly interesting story, acting and imaginative ideas is a heck of a deal.

Unfortunately by the time the final credits rolled I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth!  How could such a brilliant premise go awry in its final hour or so????  Part of the problem with the Lost Room is that it keeps introducing new characters/objects all the way up to the final act without giving them any room to breathe.  The final part of this mini-series also felt very rushed, almost like it had no direction for its conclusion.  I sort of wish they had lengthened this show out (6 parts or perhaps even a full season?) and came up with a better conclusion because the one here bites the big one!

2737413,5,B000MMMTD2,"Like many who saw this miniseries, I thought I was being set up for disappointment. I expected it to be some sort of horror film about a room where people enter and disappear. Instead, it turned out to be a mind-bending supernatural detective story. In a way, it parallels the philosophical and scientific pursuit of truth that takes place every day. It seems to draw on elements of Lord of the Rings, Stargate, and several episodes of The Twilight Zone. It even draws on Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life. However, it puts these elements together in totally new ways. Apparently, the creators of this miniseries were familiar with theories of synchronicity and quantum mechanics. Yet, they never explicitly invoke these disciplines.

It is obvious from the ending that the SciFi Chanel is considering a sequel. I hope they make it. This is one of those things like Highlander that takes on a life of its own. Countless people that I know personally and am aware of from forums and other sources have begun to collect the objects depicted in the miniseries and have started to envision sequels. It will continue in some form whether the SciFi Chanel does it or not. The SciFi Chanel has opened a door to a new universe. Like the Star Trek universe, it has its own rules and idiosyncrasies. Maybe the ending has significance that no one has grasped: once you open that kind of door, you can never close it.",1179964800,4,1407,4.696356275303644

It had a total Steve King like charm about it and I didn't get that typical deja vu feeling I always get when watching anything. You know the whole oh god this movie/show is so predictable I can tell you the whole plot from watchign the first 5 seconds.  It was so refreshing to watch something different for a change.

A lot of SciFi channel series are not all that well done, but this is a quite welcome exception. I watched the whole thing in two sittings, and it took some self control not to watch it in one. Wonderful concept, extraordinarily well written, reminiscent in some respects of some of the novels of Tim Powers. The strong script seems to have been a factor in assembling an excellent cast, both for the principals and for the minor characters

Some viewers may be disappointed that, although the main story is resolved, aspects of the central mystery remain, and there are some dangling plot elements obviously left as a basis for sequels. I would like to see a sequel, but only if the same high writing and production values can be maintained.

I noticed some complaints about the DVD production values. On my DVD player and HD TV it looked fine. The picture could perhaps have been a bit sharper, but it still looked quite a bit better than it would have if I'd caught it in its original broadcast on the SciFi channel.",1176681600,7,1134,4.63681592039801

2737423,3,B000MMMTD2,"I really enjoyed this Sci Fi miniseries. It was an original concept with a well developed plot and generally good acting. Being from western Pa, I enjoyed the fact that it was set in Pittsburgh. I won't describe the plot, that's already been done in previous reviews. So let's describe the DVD. I had recorded the complete series, but enjoyed it so much I decided to spring for the DVD. Now you would assume that the manufacturer would take the time to insure all the features, menu options, etc. worked as displayed on the screen. You would however be wrong. I knew I was in trouble when removing the security stickers. There is so much glue on them that you get a thick layer of sticky goo on the top and bottom of the DVD case. Great start. When you load Disc 1, you get some previews for some other Lionsgate productions. A Bermuda Triangle (another Sci Fi miniseries) preview is included and the transfer looks like it came from a VCR. Anyway, you get though this stuff (the menu button is disabled) and are presented with THE LOST ROOM. There are 4 ""episode"" radio buttons and a Play All radio button. As you step through these, you will note that the ""highlight"" doesn't match the radio button. (but surprisingly, go to an episode and back and it does) As noted in another review, the Play All button does not work and takes you back to the previews. Really frustrating. However, the worst part, is that the video transfer quality is horrendous. I am so disappointed, I haven't even bothered with disc 2. So be warned, if you buying this because you enjoyed ""The Lost Room"", you will be really disappointed in lack of effort Lionsgate put into this DVD.

Mmmaybe. Still. Very entertaining concept. An ""event"" many years ago in a motel room creates the doorway through all doorways and all of the objects in that room gained a special power. And everyone wants them. And this cop's daughter disappears into the room. Thus begins the journey to bring his daughter back and unravel the secrets of room 10. My blurb is just the tip of the iceberg. A very fun trip for the viewer. It could have resolved itself a little better. (And I don't mean having everything explained. Hey, I like a little lingering mystery. But this was sloppy writing for a climax.) Other than that...oh what fun. Highly recommended!

2737426,4,B000MMMTD2,"Taking the idea of an old ""Twilight Zone"" episode ""Little Girl Lost"" one step further, ""The Lost Room"" is a top notch bit of entertainment with great performances.

SPOILERS AHEAD:

A cosmic event occurred in a motel room in 1961 that altered time and space forever. All the objects in the room suddenly have mysterious, weird powers attributed to them. When police officer Joe Miller(Peter Krause)accidently comes into possession of a key to room 10 where the ""event"" happened, he finds that the key when used can teleport him anywhere he has been before. More importantly is the place that he has to go before being teleported--a room from that motel that no longer exists. When Joe's daughter uses the key to escape from thugs intend on taking the key from Joe she disappears. Suddenly Joe is thrust into a world full of conspiracy as he discovers multiple warring groups--the Legion a group dedicated to eliminating the objects, a group that worships the objects and believes they will provide them with access to God and a wealthy man (Kevin Pollack) who wants the key and objects for his own reasons.

END OF SPOILERS:

Featuring a top notch cast including Roger Bart, Dennis Christopher, Julianna Margulies and Margaret Cho ""The Lost Room"" never stays past check out time. The mini-series does leave some dangling loose ends that could be followed up in a sequel or TV series but the main story is self contained with a solid resolution. Although the main question doesn't get answered (what occurred? Who caused it to occur and why?) like many magicians tricks knowing how something was done doesn't necessarily improve the trick itself and could diminish its impact.

Although some of the characters could have been fleshed out a bit more and we had a number of lingering mysteries, the show still managed to be engaging, intelligent and fun to watch. The show isn't overwhelmed by CGI effects which gives the focus over to the drama where it belongs.

The show looks so-so. It's poorly authored and has edge enhancement, aliasing and a whole lot of digital artifacts. The only extra we get is a 18 minute featurette but its pretty comprehensive; we hear about the inspiration for the mini-series through to the casting process and production. While I would have liked some commentary tracks, this two disc set won't disappoint those who saw the show during its original run on Sci-Fi Channel and newbies.

One of the best sci-fi/fantasy shows of the year, ""The Lost Room"" has some dazzling performances, well written scripts and sharp direction that make checking out of this motel difficult at the very end.",1175731200,24,2618,4.882882882882883

Like reading a book you can't put down. While watching it I had some of the same feelings the first time I saw the Matrix (Part 1, ahem, not the others). Its a lot less ""heavy"" than the Matrix though, but has some similar vibes at times.

If you're on the fence about getting this, don't be! Its only 17 bucks (at this time) and well worth every penny. I've bought a copy for my dad, and two other friends. The chances are a million to one, but maybe if DVD sales are ""okay"", Sci Fi will consider doing another mini-series based around the Lost Room universe, or to dream... an entire series.",1174694400,11,747,4.26056338028169

It's nice to hear the passion from the creators of how the story came to be.  The discs are like most these days where you have to skip through trailers about other shows before you get to the menu.  The quality is good and just like watching on sci-fi.",1513987200,2,688,4.097014925373134

PS  Been watching 'The Americans' on Prime and totally freaked out when I found out the new head of the FBI is the guy with the bus ticket.  And if you don't have any idea what I'm talking about, you REALLY need to buy this movie.",1511308800,,415,4.012195121951219
