4380639,5,B004HSJXXQ,"This DVD Collection is a Must for All Yankee fans who want to relive the World Series, If it like Most Of the MLB Produced DVDs it will have all 6 World series games complete, Also look for an additional DVD maybe with the Clincher  over the Angels and a Season Long Highlight DVD,
Also a Big thing is that on the MLB and Yankee Website this is listed at $79.99, here at Amazon I pre-booked it at $59.99, a saving of $20.00,",1257811200,11,424,4.108433734939759
4380640,5,B004HSJXXQ,"I can't wait to get my hands on this collection. I've been a YANKEE fan since I was 5 yrs old (I'm 50 now), I have, like all YANKEE fans, been waiting 9 long years for the championship to return to it's rightful place(YANKEE STADIUM). I know Yankee haters are upset and preying for our demise, hate on, we're going for 28,29,and beyond. To be able to relive this Championship over and over on DVD is a Christmas gift I will cherish for the rest of my life. Thank you A-ROD,C.C.,AJ,MARK,GODZILLA and SWISH for coming over to give the core four the help we needed to get back on top. With our young guns and future additions the future is bright for all YANKEE fans worldwide. I gave this collection 5 stars before I even got my hands on it because it's the DVD chonicle of the most prestigous professional franchise in American sports doing what they do best;win,win, win. Thank you to the Steinbrenner's for always striving to give the YANKEE fans what we want; a champion. ""There is no substitute for winning.",1257724800,14,1010,4.494565217391305
4380641,5,B004HSJXXQ,"What can you say about this collection? This has been a great series for baseball fans, and now this will be
a great add for fans of the New York yankees in general. Assuming this will be in 8 dvds, it will feature all 6 games, with each inning as a ""chapter"", and additional playoff game, which will probably be Game 6 of the Alcs against the Angels, and an additional dvd with bonus footage and highlights of the year, including most probably Derek jeter's 2722nd carrer hit and mariano Rivera's 500th save. and awesome set for fans of all ages. a must add!!",1257465600,10,560,4.394230769230769

looking for a gift for New york Yankee fans..this is it!!..Great VALUE on the dvd set.",1352678400,2,184,5.166666666666667
4380644,5,B004HSJXXQ,"First of all, if you're looking at this set you're either a Yankees fan, just a fan of Baseball in general or someone who really hates the Phillies. So there is no need to convince you that this is a great collection. But I will say that the time and care given to the complete details of not only the world series, but also to the division and championship series footage leading up to it, are a must for anyone looking to relive this amazing world series. Too many other sets have only highlights, so to be able to watch the complete games was a joy.",1347494400,,552,4.216981132075472
4380645,5,B004HSJXXQ,I bought this dvd so my 7yr old son could watch a Yankees game whenever he wanted. The dvd's play...so it does it's job.,1317254400,,120,4.041666666666667
4380646,5,B004HSJXXQ,It's great to relive the classic moments of the 2009 World series. I am pleased with this product; it arrived quickly and in the condition described by the vendor.,1315180800,,163,4.655172413793103
4380647,5,B004HSJXXQ,"There is only one thing to say about this World Series Collector's Edition: ""It is high, it is far, IT IS GONE! SEE YA! A grand slam for the Yankees!"" This set is a Yankee fan's dream, with all six games of the 2009 World Series and Game 6 of the ALCS in HD and a choice of FOUR audio tracks (the original Fox audio, the Phillies radio feed, ESPN Deportes (Spanish) audio, and (best of all) the Yankees Radio Network feed with John Sterling and Suzyn Waldman! This is a ""must have"" for any true Yankees fan!",1306627200,5,507,4.183673469387755
4380648,5,B004HSJXXQ,"I've only watched a few games, but I can already say I'm really enjoying this set, and it is very well done. I have a few other sets like this, but this is the first one that includes pre and post game coverage and player interviews. Other sets just cut out after the last out.

The Yankees aren't my #1 team, I like the Tigers, but I can honestly say Yankee fans and Baseball geeks like me should buy this.",1303689600,,407,4.0875
4380649,5,B004HSJXXQ,"I bought this gift for my son, an avid Yankees fan.  He loved it! I honestly thought, before buying it, I'd be looking at a high price, but Amazon's low price surprised me.  The quality is great, my son is happy, and I'm looking to buy more for my grandsons!",1299369600,,258,4.14
4380650,5,B004HSJXXQ,"When it comes to the Yankees, especially a collectors edition, it's always good.

I can never get enough of the yankees.",1298246400,,120,4.714285714285714
4380651,4,B004HSJXXQ,I have the world series video mlb always give out but this is great! all the series games entirely! i just ordered my copy! a must for the die hards! GO YANKEES!,1279843200,,161,4.0625
4380652,5,B004HSJXXQ,"I know it's late to be reviewing this product, but, I still can't get over the fact that they won!  I waited for this to come out and bought it the minute it was for sale!  It is a great DVD collection of the 2009 WS.  The games have the option of either listening to tv(FOX) or radio, of the team radio broadcast of each game.  Which I thought was a great idea as I love listening to the NY radio announcers.  Listening to the opposing teams announcers is kinda fun, too.  Different reactions to the same thing happening on the field.  It also has Spanish language options, too.  They also include the last game of each of the previous Yankees series, meaning the ALDS and ALCS games to lead into the WS.

1 DVD per game in its entirety, so it's 6 WS games and 1 each for the others.  Great packaging and graphics from MLB.",1277683200,,824,4.191082802547771
4380653,5,B004HSJXXQ,"If you're watching one of these DVDs and it comes out 1.33:1 fullscreen, you've got your DVD player set up wrong. All games on this set are in full 1.78:1 widescreen.

Blu-Ray would definitely help, though...",1270252800,,208,4.777777777777778
4380654,3,B004HSJXXQ,"This is a must for any Yankees fan, but MLB is lazy on this video set. The radio broadcast and the convenience of having all the games together is the only value for me, but he production is sub-par, with unusually long lapses of audio as noted in other reviews.

After owning the former versions of Yankees World Series victories, I was looking forward to one of the DVDs (bonus DVD?) possibly having a story build up with fan reactions, ...not so.  MLB essentially took stock video footage and audio and mushed them together.",1262390400,,527,4.595744680851064
4380655,4,B004HSJXXQ,"The specs listed on Amazon's site, as well as every review I've read state this collection is Full Screen. Much to my surprise and joy, the set I received from Amazon is in fact 1:78 Widescreen!! Either people have their equipment set up incorrectly, or I got a rare pressing. I have uploaded captures using Power DVD into the customer images section of this product to confirm my set is indeed 1:78 widescreen.",1262044800,2,411,4.6438356164383565
4380656,5,B004HSJXXQ,"For an avid fan who loves to see every game plus additional footage, this is the product.",1261958400,,89,4.294117647058823
4380657,4,B004HSJXXQ,"I'm just getting through this set, but here are my initial impressions.

The Good:

1) It is great to have all the World Series games in their entirety.  My 11 year old is a big fan, but wasn't able to watch all of the games live.
2) The ability to switch between the Fox broadcasters and the Yankee radio broadcasters is a nice touch.

The So, So:

1) Video quality and sound quality are acceptable, but not great.
2) The Yankee radio broadcast doesn't quite match up with the video, and there are some dead spots.  As an axample: after the last call of the game 6 ALDS win the audio goes silent during the celebration on the field.  You hear ""The Yankees win"" and then silence while the on-field celebration is going on.
3) On the bonus disc, you can only play all off the main menu.  If you go to the Milestones section, you can't play all of the clips.  You can only go through them one by one.

The Bad:
1) Why isn't this available on Blu-ray?
2) The lack of a recap of the 2009 season, or the playoffs is inexcusable.
3) Why isn't this available on Blu-ray?

In conclusion a good set for the Yankees fan wanting all of the World Series games in their entirety.  [...]",1261699200,8,1173,4.2342342342342345
4380658,4,B004HSJXXQ,"This just arrived for X-Mas so im really happy about it... just saw some parts of the first game of ws, and everything was cool ( good resolutionn / although no HD ), and audio track ( in Spanish !!!! ), later will watch all the games, and enjoy YANKEES winning the WS.

Also the last DVD ( BONUS ) contains all the walkoff wins / Mariano 500 save / Jeter passing Gehrig / etc...

A friend who is a Yankee fan almost killed me, because i didn't tell him this DVD SET was available,

As always AMAZON super fast shipping RULES !!

I really recommend this to any YANKEE fan looking to experience all the WS over again.

I know some people will complain about the DVD not containing all PLAYOFF GAMES, or HD QUALITY VIDEO,
but sometime you cannot get all that you wish for.",1261612800,,770,4.210884353741497
4380659,4,B004HSJXXQ,"It's great DVD collection but in my opinion, they needed to add a little more. They should have added the club house celebration of Game 6 of the ALDS and WS with more interviews from the Yankees. Other than that, no commercials for a 3 hour plus game that's great.",1261180800,,265,4.32
4380660,3,B004HSJXXQ,"In theory this set looks simply spectacular: All 6 games of the 2009 World Series, with multiple audio options, highlight reels and slick packaging.

However, the video quality of the set is utterly disappointing. Only presented in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio (full-screen), it is syndication quality at best and doesn't even come close to as crisp as the HD broadcasts on Fox.

If you don't care about picture, then by all means pick up the set. But they really dropped the ball on this one, which is just heartbreaking or this diehard Bleacher Creature.",1261180800,12,549,4.829787234042553
4380661,5,B004HSJXXQ,"All 6 games of the 2009 WS plus game 6 of the ALCS are included in this box set. 4 different audio tracks. Fox TV, WCBS Radio (John Sterling), Phillies Radio and ESPN Desportes. Plus an extra disc of bonus features. Looks like another winner from MLB home video.",1260835200,11,262,4.36734693877551

8429695,5,B004HSJXXQ,"Great DVD series!  It was great to watch again the last World Series of the ""Core 4"" and to relive all the memories.  Very happy with the quality of these DVDs!  I would recommend them to any Yankee fans!",1477958400,,204,4.17948717948718
