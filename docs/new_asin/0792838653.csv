144250,5,0792838653,"First time I saw the movie ""Fluke"" I couldn't stop looking at it. Then it wouldn't get out of my mind. I saw it over and over again. This is a sort of mythical movie, but so natural and realistic it doesn't get in  the way. The photography is an absolute delight. Notice the way the puppy  barks in the beginning of the movie...recognize it's one of those rare dogs  with a mystic soul. This incredible movie is one of the three best I've  ever seen.",955238400,,450,4.1976744186046515
144251,5,0792838653,Fluke is a good movie. I didn't get to see all of it because we were watching it at school. It was one of the best movies I have seen. It is about a man that dies and turns into a dog. Then he goes back to where he  use to live as a man and plays games with his son. It is a great movie for  adults or teenagers. Young kids might not like some of the scenes of this  movie.,954201600,2,373,3.524390243902439
144252,5,0792838653,"I was shocked when I saw this movie; it was not what I expected.  I thought I'd hate it, but I trusted Eric Stoltz's integrity with chosing projects so I watched it.  The movie was remarkable and the script was very  well done.  Clever use of a dog to get the viewer to sympathize with the  bad guy.",925862400,,299,4.086206896551724
144253,5,0792838653,As a dog-lover I truly appreciate the beauty of this movie and it's significance.  The makers have done a tremendous job of portraying the animals and giving them personality.  The story itself really pulls at my  heart-strings and never fails to reduce me to tears.  A work of art!  Thanks for making such a beautiful movie!,916963200,,325,4.732142857142857
144264,5,0792838653,"Surrealism doesn't even begin to explain this film. Yes, reincarnation is a dog's lot, but he learns so much on his journey as a canine who only wants to find the truth about his family and his best friend. Who is the audience for this flick? Dogs, kids, dreamers and squirrels.",1503619200,,278,4.470588235294118
144265,5,0792838653,"I  don't  think  there  is  another  movie  that  can  kind  of  sink  into  the  imagination  the  way  this  one  does.  I  guess  we're  the  ones  that  must  decide  for  ourselves  what  we  believe  is  real.  I  guess  its  enough  to  get  lost  in  the  fantasy  world  each  time  you  watch  the  movie.  &  it  does  make  you  have  thoughts.  I'll  say  that.  I  found  myself  a  believer  afterwards.  This  movie  sends  its  own  message  &  leaves  all  wondering  on  the  inside.  A  man  named  Tom, (Matthew Modine)  After  having  an  argument  with  his  high  school  buddy  Jeff  (Eric Stolz)  is  killed  in  a  car  crash.  &  is  reborn  again  as  a  puppy  who  becomes  a  dog  &  sets  off  to  find  his  kid  &  wife  who  he  feels  he's  left  behind  &  must  let  them  know  he  is  okay.  (Ron Pearlman)  does  okay  in  just  a  few  scenes  in  the  movie  as  some  creep.
That  is  the  first  time  I  ever  saw  him  in  a  movie.  But  it  was  interesting  seeing  him  in  the  movie.
Some  disturbing  parts  of  the  movie  is  when  Rumbo  gets  shot  after  being  the  hero  &  busting  Fluke  &  the  rest  of  the  animals  out  of  the  Laboratory.  I  find  it  hard  to  believe  that  a  dog  would  actually  do  that  bust  through  a  glass  window.
It  makes  you  wonder  every  time  you  watch  it.
&  gives  us  all  the  true  definition  of  Love.
I  recommend  it  to  anyone  who  loves  dogs.",1503532800,,1469,3.9919028340080973

144267,5,0792838653,"My little boy, who is 7, wanted me to write a review of this movie after we finished watching it.  He really loved it.  He thought the background story of a man who was too busy for his family and missed what was really important in life was great, and of course, he loved the dog's part in that story.  I think it this would be a great movie for kids and families to watch together.",1499644800,,383,4.0131578947368425

144271,2,0792838653,"Parents should know that there are two violent car crashes, in one of which a father dies (to be reincarnated as Fluke), the son's life is imperiled during a snow storm, and Fluke doesn't get to stay with his family at the end. What I really didn't like is that Fluke basically drops into his old family's life, stirs things up so that *he* learns some lessons, and then leaves them again. It's got a good cast -- the little boy is great -- but it's really a sad movie if you stop and think about it. And as a widow, I find the scene where the wife realizes Fluke is her dead husband -- and then he leaves, limping off into the snow, heartrending, not heartwarming. I wouldn't show this movie to kids.",1495497600,2,701,4.2388059701492535
144272,1,0792838653,"I kept thinking there would be a happy ending, but not really. It was horribly sad and had my girls and me in tears through most of the movie. So NOT a family movie.",1494028800,,165,3.8823529411764706

144274,5,0792838653,I love this story because its about real life and how we might sometimes not appreciate what we already have. Even as a grown woman I still cry watching but I still adore this film to my very soul. I love fluke he is just the best,1491350400,2,230,3.9148936170212765
144275,1,0792838653,This movie is a terrifying movie even for adults and is definitely not for kids.  It was traumatizing for my family.  It showed two car accidents (one of the accidents led to the father dieing and the other showed a bloody injury).  It also showed the death of one dog and the injury of the dog who was the main character.  It is a crime to allow this movie to be viewed without a disclaimer to families with kids.,1489449600,,414,4.2025316455696204
144276,5,0792838653,"I saw this movie before going to see ""A Dog's Purpose"" Because I could relate both movies to each other. They were both great movies.",1488067200,,133,4.36

144327,4,0792838653,"I truly enjoyed this movie.  I was shocked this movie came out in the 90's since I am an animal lover and this one got by me.  I never heard of the movie but is was free on a streaming service.  I really enjoyed it, but I found the final message made no sense.  Unfortunately, I cannot give my reason for my perception since it would require ""spoilers"". I immediately read the book after watching the movie.  Great book as well and I think the ending message is clear in the book.  They just could not relay the message on the big screen since the book was adapted for the big screen for kids.  The book is not a kids book.",1486166400,,623,4.099173553719008

Not only can Fluke talk but he can think, act, make you cry, make you laugh and realize that in the end he made the best decision for his family just as a mother who is unable to take care of her child gives the child away to the best possible person for the best possible life.

It wasted a lot of film space having Fluke, the reincarnated dog, trying to persuade us of his human origins with some simple, fairly common canine tricks. The movie was simply not going anywhere until well past the midway point when Fluke connects with his human wife and son. Soon after, a major reversal occurs in our understanding of Fluke's human self and that of his human partner, who we had assumed was responsible for Fluke-human's death. The movie ends with another major twist. Fluke abandons his home and is leading a separate life from his family, who have adopted another puppy. Why these two unnecessary reversals? Especially since the second one yields a very unsatisfactory conclusion.  In trying to escape the predictable (no enemy to a good children's story) the scriptwriters embraced the unacceptable.",1482451200,,939,5.051612903225807

145709,5,0792838653,"It's not a children's movie per say...it's not like putting on Barney or Barbie....I see it as more like a teenager/young adult movie, for the simple fact that for a PG film, it has quite a bit of violence and death. Besides young children wouldn't understand such strong adult thematic events, I mean it would be awkward having to explain something like this to a child. I don't know exactly why I like this movie, there's a magnetic pull, that attracts me to it. I was 8 years old when my mom bought the vhs for me back in '95 and I loved it!! I'm now 27 and I still haven't changed. I still love it, the only difference now that I'm older is, I understand it, which makes me love it even more. It can't be easy to practically be human in an animals body, experiencing human emotions such as love, sadness, happiness, hate, anger, jealousy, and regret....in a way it's a complicating story @ the same time, it's not. There are a lot of different themes here, learn to love your family and be there for them everyday, learn to be happy with who you are or what you are, don't judge a book by its cover, and learn to appreciate and love life, the way an animal does. I suppose that it can be a little disturbing to feel love and desire for a woman(his human wife @ one point) as a dog, in fact almost perverted, but then again this is no ordinary dog. As a dog it is impossible to assume the role of a male human to care for a human family...so he reluctantly leaves the job to his best friend, Jeff to care for them in the end. It's also possible for a soul to continually reincarnate like rumbo(another dog) in the beginning for example, as he is reborn again as a squirrel in the end. It is a strange form of immortality, but there you go. It's one of those films, where you'll never look @ your pet the same way again, especially a dog...one of the other things I love about this film, is the orchestra composition, the music is beautiful in my opinion, and I downloaded some tracks on my phone, which I enjoy listening to, and makes me think about fluke. Anyway, the beginning is kind of cute with the pups, and ridiculous in terms of the humor, I personally thought the film got better, when he journeys to his home town Hopewell. But without the beginning, you wouldn't know the end.  so if you like dogs, me I love dogs, and you like a lot of drama, you will like this...probably.

It's also not completely traditional, you're wondering what the heck is going on the whole movie and how it could possibly end. Beautiful at some points, a little childish and silly in most. *Spoiler alert: The chimp carrying the little dog to save him from the lab may be one of my favorite cutesy movie images of all time !",1417651200,,413,4.3076923076923075

I don't understand, why this movie did not make it to immortality, I am a very loyal collector and reader of valuable literature, as well as viewer of meaningful movies, ""Fluke"" is about the level of ""Les Miserables""  in regards of teaching ethical values.

145755,5,0792838653,"""Fluke"" is a wonderful film...some great comedic moments and some incredibly sad sequences.  Frankly, it might be a little too mature, theme-wise, for children.  The film does deal with human jealousy, mistrust, love, hate, and death on several levels.  There are also scenes of what I consider to be animal cruelty and abuse.  Some of the scenes might be a bit too intense for younger viewers.  This is not a cartoon version of human and/or animal life.  It is a good film for adults.",1409875200,,485,4.714285714285714

I was very satisfied with my order! :)",1403740800,,119,3.8
145770,2,0792838653,"While I understand why this isn't rated PG13, it seemed to really push the boundaries of a PG movie. It is NOT the 'cute animal' story it presents itself to be.

There was more language in it than I expected. Nothing horrific, but things like 'damn' and a few 'what the hells'. Good to know so you can decide for your own family if you're okay with that or not. There's also a scene with a man rather pointedly chain smoking, which I generally don't expect to find in a 'family' movie.

It's a rather violent movie for the genre/rating. There are various dog attack scenes (which could frighten children harboring any anxiety about dogs), a scene where a man fires a gun and intentionally hits an animal, and two different violent car crash scenes, as well as overtones of murder. And death, lots of death, from animals to people. Not what I gleaned from the cover or description at all and it might be upsetting to younger or more sensitive children.

The message of this story is a good one, but I feel strongly that it's misrepresented in the description and cover. Don't expect a 'Babe' or 'Milo and Otis', because this is nothing like either of those. While I don't imagine for a second that my school-aged children were scarred from seeing it, it might be too much for some kids and parents should allow their younger children to see it with great caution.

Decent story, but not the type of story it appears to be and probably inappropriate on various levels for the younger set.",1402876800,2,1486,4.5335820895522385

146032,5,0792838653,"I saw this on network TV, was utterly charmed and moved by it, and immediately ordered the DVD.  I have no doubt it will stand up to the ""repeated viewing"" test.  The range of looks on Fluke's face is simply incredible, what a beautiful dog, a seeming old soul.  In all of Fluke's scenes you'd swear he's a sentient being, there's no hint of a trainer anywhere in the vicinity (also the case with other animals, e.g., dogs, a chimp, a squirrel, all behave and interact totally naturally, as though no cameras or people are present, just phenomenal).

This movie is all about love of family, righting wrongs, and redemption.  It's profoundly moving and yet subtly so, not sentimental, saccharine or maudlin, dealing with death in an honorable way, neither trivializing it nor exploiting it.  I'm a big fan of films (so few and far between) that handle death gracefully, with dignity, and in a way that enriches us, delivers closure.  The movie works its magic on you below the surface, you won't see the tears coming.  And, there are a couple of surprising twists and a happy, perhaps slightly hokey but eminently satisfying ending.

Personally, I think this film suitable for any child old enough to know that people die.  Other reviewers think not, though, so you might want to view it first to gauge its appropriateness for your own children.  Animal control officers are depicted as the bad guys (from the animals' point of view), which will warrant a talk with your kids about such matters.

If you're an animal lover, I say buy this movie, you will LOVE it!

And no, for most small children, screening this for them probably wouldn't be the best idea. Read up on it before trying to guess whether or not it is something your kid can take.

I saw Fluke for the first time in mid 2011, and as a 90's baby, I regret not seeing this movie as a child. I received it on DVD just weeks before Christmas of 2011, and it ranks high as one of my all-time favourites of my DVD collection. It's a beautiful and moving film, with a soundtrack that is equally as beautiful, and it has helped me to get in touch with my beliefs. The story is touching and there is a good moral behind it all.

Basically, it tells the tale of a man who dies in a tragic car crash, and is reincarnated as a puppy, later named Fluke. As his puppyhood progresses into adulthood, he has reoccurring dreams of his human family from before his death, and he sets off on a journey to reunite with them. --that's the most I want to give away, you'll have to see it for yourself!

146073,5,0792838653,"I caught ""Fluke"" on the movie channel, and at first I was unsure about watching it, but I sure am glad I did. I am a shadow boomer, so I grew up with many of the family films of the early to mid-90's that were made in large amounts. Some were great, others not too great. However, Fluke takes the cake. I would argue that emotionally, thematically, and directorially, this movie is the best family-friendly film made in the 1990's and one of the most sensitive, lovingly made movies of all time.

Since many others have explored the plot, I am going to eschew that and instead explore the factors that make this movie heartstoppingly beautiful. First off, the animal acting is the most remarkable animal acting I have ever seen. The animals move the heart and actually give off emotions that any pet lover could be familiar with. The casting was also great, I could not see any but Eric Stoltz playing the voice of Fluke/Mr. Johnson. If I could meet him I would say, ""You might have missed out on ""Back To the Future"", but what a legacy you leave in this film"". His widow, his son, and his best friend are also wonderfully cast. His hometown was also beautifully cast, it is a beautiful utopia where I wouldn't mind living, with mansions surrounded by nature leading to beautiful offices.

The writing, love, and pure heart put into this movie are mesmerizing. I would consider myself fairly emotional, but I would argue this is the most heart-rending movie I have ever seen. I was crying for about half the picture. For me, ""Fluke"" beats out legendary films such as ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and ""Marty"" (1955 Best Picture winner) for its emotional impact. Fluke explores so many complex themes, including life after death, appreciating life, work-life balance, friendship, ego, moving on, forgiving, the rights of all creatures, eternal love, and others that it acts as a great commentary film as well. It is definitely more than a kids movie in the respect and many others.

The cinematography and score are also remarkable. Highlights for me in this respect included the scene where Fluke and his pal set the animals free from the lab. This type of scenario should be familiar to many who remember kids' movies from the 90's, but none has been executed nearly as beautifully, emphasizing the glory of freedom.

This film also thankfully largely lacks cartoonish bad guys to create tension. There is one dogcatcher type character, but he is marginal. Instead, the film relies on Eric Stoltz's struggle as the ultimate underdog to reach his family, avoid obstacles, and try to tell his family who he is. Fluke's friendship with the dog Rumbo, who was an African-American sailor in his past life, provides a nice contrast with another creature trying to understand his new life yet still connect with his loved ones.

If I had my way this film would have won Best Picture or at least swept the Humanitas Prizes, for emphasizing so many human themes that challenge us all and that make films like Fluke so incredibly inspiring. I have never seen a more lovingly crafted film.",1327622400,,3073,4.736448598130841
146104,5,0792838653,"I must admit I enjoyed the film more than the book, the book though well written was somewhat episodic. The film has its low points as well, such as Fluke's rescue scene where Rumbo crashes into the lab and sets free all the animals - a bit far fetched and found nowhere in the book. The screen writers completely rewrite the finish leaving one to wonder if his former wife had any notion of who Fluke was or had been; despite her tears it was difficult to tell. Again, the scene found nowhere in the book. Also, Tom's former business partner staying the night with his wife while they were not married. In the book, they had been married, though Fluke had no knowledge of this. Still, who can forget the characters, and who cannot be touched by the conclusion, the reconnecting of Rumbo and Fluke. I think it was because of this I enjoyed the film more for in the book they did not reconnect. Overall, I enjoyed the film very much a gave it a high rating.",1326412800,,956,4.346368715083799

146109,5,0792838653,"I was torn whether to give Fluke a 1 or 5 star rating.  Why?  Because I was literally CRYING right from the very beginning.  Right when you see adorable puppies walking around in some back alley with their mother, I was crying.

I'm 29 years old and I'm a man.  Guess what?  I WAS CRYING LIKE A BABY WATCHING FLUKE!

This is seriously one of the most emotionally heart-breaking dog movies I've ever seen.

First of all, I love golden retrievers with a passion.  I think they're absolutely the most adorable puppies and dogs on the face of the planet.

Whichever writer was responsible for finding just the right golden retriever to star in Fluke did an AMAZING job.  I was looking into this dogs eyes and seeing one of the most intelligent animals I've ever seen.  We're talking a dog that made me cry just by his spot-on eye movements alone.  It's like the dog was part human.  He'd follow along perfectly to the movements of the little boy and his mother at *all* the right moments.  Amazing job on the writers part.

The storyline... oh right.  Just by reading the description you know what to expect, and trust me, it delivers *exactly* how you're imaginging it would.  A husband/father comes back through reincarnation as a golden retriever to search for his wife and child.

Eventually the wife and child notice that the dog is doing a ton of things that strongly resemble what their father/husband used to do, so they become interested and suspicious of the dogs actions.

However, the majority of the storyline is about the golden retrievers adventures through a dreary city and just being a dog on the run from all the bad guys who keep threatening to put him in doggy prison.

He meets a friend -another much bigger and older (and more street smart) dog, and so the two dogs then become close friends.

Yes, you will hear voice actors actually talking to indicate that the two dogs are communicating with each other.  It actually works though.  Works REALLY well.  Remember- I was actually crying hard watching this film earlier today.  I wouldn't be crying if it hadn't worked- I would've been laughing, and I definitely wasn't doing that!

I absolutely love Fluke... or hate it!  It's one of these strong reactions for sure!  I watched this movie when it first came out, but since that time I've learned to appreciate dogs even more, so the storyline really hit me incredibly hard.  If you absolutely love dogs...  I don't know.  I seriously can't recommend it... or do I STRONGLY recommend it?  AHHH!!!",1283126400,2,2515,4.6560364464692485

146138,4,0792838653,"Fluke (Carlo Carlei, 1995)

There is book, and there is film. And every once in a while, there are book and film that are utterly unlike one another, and yet both are brilliant. Perhaps the best-known example of this phenomenon is Stephen King's novel and Tobe Hooper's TV miniseries 'Salem's Lot, which bear at best a passing resemblance as narrated by a gallon drunk. Fluke comes off the same way, and despite Carlei's ham-handedness, this movie works.

First, you have to realize this movie is based on a novel by James Herbert. The phrases ""James Herbert"" and ""family film"" are incapable of existing in the same sentence without quotes around them, or some sort of weird dimensional rift will open in the Universe, and the things that come through will eat all humanity, but not before subjecting it to weird perverse tortures. (No, they're not Cenobites. The things in James Herbert's imagination eat Cenobites for breakfast and use the nails as toothpicks.) So one has to wonder, as I have for the past ten years, how any movie based on a James Herbert novel could possibly be called a ""wonderful family film"" by, erm, at least one critic blurbed on the DVD cover. I forget which. Then I remembered 'Salem's Lot, and still had some hope that we might get a good film out of it (film adaptations of James Herbert novels tend to be bloody boring-- they cut out all the good bits to avoid the video nasty laws). Then they attach an unknown writer-director and Matthew Modine, a guy whose career was going nowhere fast in 1995 (though it did pick up again soon after this, and has almost hit its previous level). I got to the point where the only hope I had for this flick lay in Eric Stoltz, whom I have always loved and will always love, no matter how awful the films in which he appears (yes, I even forgave him Anaconda. He needed the money. Honest). So, finally, I got the chance to sit down and actually watch the thing... and it really is wonderful. It bears about as much resemblance to the James Herbert novel upon which it is based as the American all-beef Ball Park bears to its wondrous ancestor the haggis, but as with the scary meat products, each is great in its own way.

Tom Johnson (Modine, recently in Transporter 2) and Jeff Newman (Stoltz, recently of The Butterfly Effect) are partners. In the opening scene, the two of them are racing down a country road. Johnson pulls up alongside Newman's car and tries to get him to pull over so they can talk. Newman ignores him, but Johnson doesn't get too long to try-- he ends up playing chicken with a truck, losing, and going over an embankment to his death. Thanks to the magic of special effects, we see his soul fly off and inhabit an Irish Setter pup. (And through the magic of film, you can get an Irish Setter pup from a mom who looks kind of like a collie mix.) The pup, who eventually becomes the title character, has a series of very nasty adventures early in his life (the first half-hour of this film makes me wonder why anyone called it a family film-- it is relentlessly depressing) before meeting Rumbo (xXx's Samuel L. Jackson), a big Saint Bernard who offers to teach him the ropes. Fluke is unhappy with his life as a dog, however; he has recurring dreams of Newman and his family, and he feels that his family is in danger.

First, the bad things about the movie. Carlei is overly ham-handed with a number of his moral lessons (especially in the final voice-over, which any editor worth his salt should have burned rather than exposing it to the elements). If you're looking at the film as something to watch with the kiddies, you may have an uncomfortable time answering some questions from the younger ones about death and vivisection that are likely to be raised in the opening half-hour of the film. And the kid who voices Fluke-as-pup (Sam Gifaldi of the animated series Hey! Arnold) sounds as if he's reading, woodenly, off a teleprompter. The end, while not actually leaving any loose ends dangling, feels a little frayed. And Nancy Travis' line ""...he needs a bath. He's filthy!""is perhaps the most unintentionally funny ever voiced in kids' films; you will never see so well-groomed and well-fed a road dog as Fluke.

The good things: well, the rest of the movie. The opening half-hour, while relentless, has no single scenes that will traumatize a kid any more than some of the stuff Disney put in their animated flicks when we were kids. Modine and Jackson have a great chemistry between them, and when Fluke starts spending most of his time around humans, things ride the line of sappy without ever quite crossing over. Most of all, Lynn Stalmaster, the High King of Casting Directors, made one of the most inspired choices of his career in Eric Stoltz. I can't explain why without ruining the crux of the film, but let's just say it would've been hard to achieve the effect the movie did without Eric Stoltz playing Newman. Perfect, perfect, casting.

Unless you're a diehard James Herbert fan who can't separate  Fluke-the-film from Fluke-the-book, you'll probably end up loving this movie despite yourself. Yeah, yeah, the talking animal thing's way overdone. That doesn't mean it can't still be done well now and again. ****",1149638400,6,5226,4.643243243243243
146139,4,0792838653,"By far one of my favorite movies when I was little, I was delighted to finally perch my DVD copy of ""Fluke"" in my movie library.  Ever since the lines began to echo in my head (""Well, he's MY little fluke""), I've known my purchase of the flick was imminent. It is, truly, a touching, poignant, and haunting film that tells of loss, betrayal, realization, and redemption on one side, and forgiveness, resilience, and pure, simple understanding on the other.  It is about learning to live your life, and learning to pick yourself up again.  It's told through the eyes of a dog, but it transcends that.

My main complaint is that the movie can't make up its mind whether to be a romping family film (just watch the theatrical trailer; they cut out the whole ""reincarnation"" bit and sell it as a kiddie flick) or a full-fledged drama.  As a result, the integrity of the film suffers, which is a true shame.  As a kid, I loved the lighter bits which I, now older, view as the movie's main pratfall.  It also tends to fall into a by-the-numbers rut in the first few sequences, (slight spoiler ahead) such as when the pup Fluke ends up in the pound and the horrible, mean people at the HUMANE SOCIETY whine about his constant barking and schedule him for a euthanasia.  (As if a puppy would be put down for barking.) Clearly, this scene seeks to scold anyone who doesn't want dogs running free on the streets.  An ideal I applauded a few years ago, but now I must view more realistically.  If the producers had allowed the film to launch into a truly moving drama, perhaps ""Fluke"" would have gained a larger audience.  Instead, it may leave the kids wandering off after the first half, and the adults fast-forwarding to the later half.

The decision is yours to make, depending on your age, but my guess is most of you will fall in love with this unique story of redemption and understanding.",1144713600,7,1885,4.495601173020527

146141,5,0792838653,"I really did; i would watch it almost everyday! It was my favorite movie back then! I held this tradition until... (sob)... my mom threw away our copy! I don't CARE if the tape was old! I still wanna see it! (I'm gonna buy it on DVD soon! ^_^) Fluke is a great movie the whole family can enjoy. It's an original story that should make you cry. It even has a pretty funny ending! I can't wait to see this movie again... anyway, this movie is about a man who dies in a car-crash and gets reincarnated as a dog--I know a lot of peeps out there that don't believe in reincarnation but just remember, this is fiction--anyway, as he grows older, he wants to see his wife and kid even more. He decides to find them. He one day sees them in a parking lot (and can't remember what they did, the last time I saw this movie was a couple years ago) and he ran up to the car window and scared his wife. She told him to shoo and after a while he got off the car and watched them drive away (i think). I sadly can't remember what happened after that but I know he goes to his house and his son asks if they can keep him for a pet. The mother agrees, reluctantly. I don't remember a lot of the rest but i know he meets another guy that was reincarnated as a dog and they become friends...and...uh...NO! I NEED TO WATCH THE MOVIE AGAIN!!! I just bought the book, so after I read the book, I plan to watch the movie. BWA HA HA~~!!! Anyway, it's a fun-filled movie. Watch it!",1122508800,3,1456,4.041522491349481
146142,5,0792838653,"Absolutely one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I saw it first in 1995 on video, I believe.  Never saw it or heard of it on the big screen.  Anyway, it's proof positive that a great directorial job, with actors (human and animal) who believe in a story about real human failings, lightheartedness and heroics can turn a pretty good screenplay with wonderfully charming dogs into one with a real impact on your life.  I had to see it again a couple of years later just to make sure it was as good as I thought. It deals with real suffering (including death, revenge, and anger) and then redemption.  Don't look for the classic happy ending, but an ending which is consistent with the themes in the movie and is very satisfying, after a little thought. The movie completely pulls you in (without your realizing it) and works its magic on your mind.  But, don't expect it to be powerful though you will notice tears forming frequently throughout the movie, often unexplained at first.  ""Fluke"" also seemed to leave me a little wiser and more understanding and compassionate toward my family, especially. I sort of got it the next day! And, you will love ""Fluke"", the dog! The movie is about a dog, but it's really about so much more. Even though the dog scenes are great, the subject matter at times is rather charged and there is violence and death (human and animal), so please be prepared to talk about it with your kids if they watch it with you.",1114905600,17,1452,4.498098859315589

146173,5,0792838653,"I first saw this movie about 3 years ago when my older sister brought over the video to my house after she saw it and told me that I had to watch it because we were such dog lovers -- my family that is.  All I have to say is that this movie just about made me bawl so hard that I needed tons of tissues.  It is just such a touching story about family.  Added to this is the cute factor of the animals that acted in there and the comic relief.  The actors also did a great job as well.  Even IF you don't believe in reincarnation, don't write it off and overlook the rest of the story because of that.  While it may not be for some young children or some older children and even some adults as well for we all have our own tastes, it is indeed a treasure for me, now 28 years old, as a movie that is sincere and one of the best movies I've ever seen and would be proud to have in my dvd collection and show to my future children.",1104883200,,928,3.832460732984293
146174,5,0792838653,"This is a wonderfully atmospheric film...it is very poignant and provokes tears on a superficial level. On a deeper level it deals with the subjects of reincarnation and also misplaced retribution - the belief that the canine Fluke holds regarding his human demise is proved inaccurate in an abrupt realisation of his error.

The canine acting is superb; this is the film I had believed could never be made when I first read James Herberts novel ""Fluke"" in the early 1980s, then came ""Look Who's Talking"" and ""Babe"" and with them the technology to produce such a movie.

This is a real tear-jerker and one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen...but please do not show it to your kids if they are sensitive, as there is a certain amount of violence and a lot of unhappiness before Fluke finds peace in his fate.",1103241600,4,818,4.595890410958904
146175,5,0792838653,"I am very pleased and quite proud to include my own

heartfelt recommendation of this wonderful film here.

It is particularly gratifying to know there are so

many others who were similarly inspired by FLUKE to

give it such a well-deserved approval rating

with Amazon.com.  The best audience is one which, in

spite of the opinion of ""experts"", recognizes excellence

all on its own.  It makes the appreciation even deeper.

Here is a movie cult I am happy to be a member of

(though I do wish my friends, in their enthusiam,

had not given away so much of the story to those

of you who have not yet discovered it for yourselves yet!)

Excellent cinematography, sensitive score, nicely modulated

acting, judiciously paced for children and adults alike.

This is that rare ""family"" film that rewards everyone, and

can be viewed many times without inspiring boredom.

FLUKE earns its emotions honestly.  I admire and respect

every animal - and person - involved in making this story work

as well as it does.  It haunts the memory with a mixture of

feelings - most of all, that of great fondness for the

purity of its moral.",1101600000,32,1131,4.682051282051282
146176,5,0792838653,"Awesome one-of-a-kind movie about a man reincarnated as a dog.  ""Fluke""'s billing as a children's movie may be slightly misleading due to the intensity, suspense and complexity of the film, traits that may be unsettling to some smaller viewers, so a big person should watch with the little ones the first time.  That aside, this is a brilliant mix of drama, comedy, thriller, and cute-animal charm (featuring multiple species), embodying all the best of all its worlds.  Allowing the viewer to see the human world through animal eyes - with all its hypocrisies, bizarre value systems, and obsessions with caging up the nonhuman denizens of the world for whatever whim strikes mankind's fancy - ""Fluke"" is a movie that highlights the value of genuine relationships, between human and human, human and animal, or animal and animal, and not in a 'master-and-servant' way, but in a way of love and comraderie.  Touching and sometimes frightening, this movie will be welcomed by any who disdain the 'pets as property' notion in favor of the 'pets as part of the family' view (and not just in cases of cross-species rebirth!)  Triumphant, at times melancholic (without ever being depressing), exhilirating, and enchanting, this is a landmark film that deserves recognition as such.",1099872000,2,1275,5.110576923076923
146177,1,0792838653,This movie is definitely not for little kids. I bought the Fluke/Napoleon set for my 2 year old daughter because she loves puppies. Napoleon was PERFECT! But Fluke was an awful movie. It had 2 people dying and a dog getting shot with a gun in it (I don't want to introduce her to violence). I threw the movie away-what a waste of money.,1089849600,4,336,4.265625
146178,5,0792838653,"FLUKE is a great movie, and it's because of Comet, the wonderfully talented canine who plays the title role.  Never has an animal performed with such emotion as Comet does in this tear-jerker, yet satisfying movie.  The human stars take back seats to both Fluke and Rombo (wonderfully voiced by the ubiquitous Samuel L. Jackson).  Nancy Travis had the glowing warmth and beauty needed to convey the hopelessness Fluke must feel in realizing he can't have his life back.  Based on a novel by spook writer James Herbert, the script pulls a real doozy on you at the end, and it's finale in the cemetery is poignantly touching.  Without using the techniques in BABE (Which were fine for that movie), FLUKE captures your heart by showing you the love a dog can bring into a life, especially when it's been reincarnated.  A wonderful film, let your kids watch it, and discuss it with them.  It's life to have loss.  But the gain is always around the corner.  Well done, guys!",1083542400,7,969,4.652941176470589
146179,5,0792838653,"I remember this movie was out in theaters for what seemed to be a short time. The trailer made the movie look like it was simply a movie for children about a man who died and came back as a dog and found his way home. I wasn't really interested. One day I was watching TV and I caught the movie almost near the end - I was captivated. And I realized the movie was about way more than simply a lost puppy. This movie is something that you won't expect - it leaves you thinking one thing until the end. (Much like a Sixth Sense fashion). ""Fluke"" begins with a man named Tom. We only see glimpses of Tom and another man driving on the road, and suddenly he swerves out of the way of a truck and is killed. The next scene we see is an ADORABLE puppy - Tom was reborn as the puppy! The movie follows the puppy through the beginnings of life (and although some parts of the movie are a bit cheesey- the animal acting is magnificant.. especially Comet aka Fluke's performance.. near the end he fakes a limp.. and I was so impressed.. I think the animal actors did better than the actor that played Tom's son!) The puppy grows up and keeps having flashes of his life before, of his wedding as a man, his wife, his son. So Fluke, as he's called - decides to find his long lost family. He meets a lot of friends along the way - such as Rombo a lovable dog that teaches him the ropes. There are some sad parts in the movie, but once you see the end it all makes sense. Fluke (aka Tom) comes to realize once he finds his family that he didn't have time for so many things as a man - time to be with his family. And again, the ending is a bit of a surprise.. and it really made me think. I thought this movie was simply for kids, it isn't! I don't know if I did a fantastic job of explaining the movie without giving anything away - but as Tom/Fluke states in the beginning- for a moment put away everything you believe in and listen to his story.",1079827200,3,1934,4.052219321148825
146200,3,0792838653,"Fluke, the warm and fuzzy star of the show does a fantastic job of gripping your heart, reeling you in, and telling the story.
The movie starts with a somewhat confusing sequence involving a car chase.  If you're not paying attention when you start this film, you may need to skip back in order to pick up a few telling details.  For the most part this opening act isn't fully explained until the end of the film.  This adds some mystery and intrigue, but get ready for a bit of a surprise.
In the movie, you'll follow young Fluke from the birth canal  (literally) through his young life.  It isn't long and he begins to ""remember"" things.  This leads him back to the family he was prematurely ripped away from.  You see Fluke was once a man!  He had a beautiful family and he wants to be with them once again.
The movie is not overly complicated at first glance, but by the end my nine year old was quite confused.  When it was over he was mostly satisfied that there were lots of cute, lovable animals to watch.  The older kids liked the movie but found it to be ""sad"" or a little ""unsettling"".
There is a clear and overt attempt to support reincarnation throughout the movie.  Several of the movie's characters are reincarnated and one more than once.  Although we would completely disagree with reincarnation and its denial of eternal reward or punishment, it offered our family an opportunity to discuss the belief that some folks have about reincarnation.
This movie offers many topics you may want to discuss with kids.  Animal laboratory research and homelessness are topics that make their way onto your television screen.  Death is also prevalent throughout this show as at least two people and one animal perish.
Overall, this is a well made film that can help you approach a philosophy believed by many.  Watch it together and support your beliefs as you discuss the movie's ideals and themes.  Of all the places you want your children to discover controversial and provocative ideas, wherever you are is a good place.",1071187200,4,2030,4.644257703081233
146201,5,0792838653,"it really is unfortunate that this movie had so little publicity, because it is one of the few movies that truly moved me....and the ONLY other movie besides White Fang and the Little Mermaid that I have watched about a million times!!  Oh, and I'm now a cynical college student...but I still love those three movies, so that tells you something about the depth and value of Fluke!
It was actually a fluke that I even got to see this movie, which was about 9 years ago?  My mom and I had bought tickets to go see ""Gordy"" (forgettable but pleasant pig movie) and we were early so we snuck in to watch a little bit of Fluke.  I was so concerned about what would happen to FLUKE (it's the name of the dog) that after ""Gordy"" was over, my mom and I went back to see Fluke from start to beginning!
Fluke is no masterpiece oscar-winning movie--in a way, this is exactly kind of movie that I expect to be obscure.  And there ARE some major flaws in the movie--for instance its lack of believability.  Still, there is SOMETHING about the movie that resonated deeply with me--no other movie has touched my heart like Fluke.  I believe I cried more in this movie than in all other movies combined!!
So, if you are looking for a family movie that is sad but heartwarming, then buy fluke!!  It is apparent from the other reviews that this movie is a rare treasure.",1064793600,2,1352,4.362549800796812

His quest to find his human family is plagued with mystery, including the fact that he must unravel the story of his old business partner. Only when he remembers what truly happened between the two of them on the night of his death does ""Fluke"" realize how he must let his family know who he is and set things right.

This movie is highly emotional and definitely a tear-jerker. I cry almost every time I watch it, at multiple parts; and I am admittedly not always the most sensitive person, nor a big blubberer over cheeseball stuff. Although grossly underrated, this movie has one of the most beautiful soundtracks I have ever heard. Just listen to the music in the background throughout the entire movie; it's magical! Slightly eerie, this film is for anyone who loves animals, mysteries, the supernatural, or just a really good film.

A couple years later (once back in america), I was browsing through a rack in a video store and I came across Fluke. I rented it again with no hesitation to see what the story line was really about.
