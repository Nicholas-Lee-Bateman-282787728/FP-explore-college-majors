It's a shame, because often times we only get one live recording per salsa great. Because of this, I would still recommend it if you are a salsa fan. We don't have many alternatives.",1482710400,,291,4.509433962264151

8299179,1,B001EOQUX2,"I like Willy Chirino's music, but this they shoud've put a bit more effort on the production of this dvd. The sound is terrible and it looks like the singers are lip singing.",1336867200,,174,4.303030303030303
8299180,4,B001EOQUX2,"El DVD logra varios propsitos, por un  lado es una buena biografa de la carrera de Chirino y por otro la calidad de la msica es muy buena. Llamo la atencin por la presentacin no solo de Willy sino de artistas de la categora de Arturo Sandoval, Cachao, Oscar D Len y sobre todo la motivante interpretacin de Generoso Jimnez . Se hace un muy buen  intento de do con Benny Mor.",1240012800,,374,4.180555555555555

8299183,5,B001EOQUX2,Treat yourself to a great evening in front of your TV with this concert. Highly enjoyable for both old and new fans of his style. The nostalgia factor for all things Cuban transpires through the whole event. You'll love the band and guests musicians (hey! anywhere Arturo Sandoval shows up must be good...).,1229040000,,307,4.811320754716981
