8024922,5,B00029YLZE,"Bill Wilson's Video does an excellent job of showing best cleaning and maintainance techniques for 1911-type semi-autos. Although the production is a bit dated and some of the audio on mine is difficult to understand, the information is still very timely.",1278374400,,255,5.2439024390243905
8024923,1,B00029YLZE,Very dissappointed in this product.  Save your money.  This DVD is really an advertising piece by Mr. Wilson for his lubrication products.  Information tossed in on the 1911 is there to keep if from being a total crass ad gimmick.  Too bad Mr. Wilson chose this and not a useful approach to the 1911.  If you are totally and completely unfamilar with field stripping a 1911 ask your local gunshop owner and save your money.,1218499200,6,423,4.586666666666667
8024924,4,B00029YLZE,This was a very informative DVD.  It really helps in teaching how to disassemble and reassemble a 1911.  It also gives good instructions on how to lube (oil or grease) the 1911.  There are also shooting instructions which are very helpful.  I recomment it.,1214784000,,256,4.75

IT  GAVE  ME  A  LOT  OF  TIPS
