8007159,1,B00016117O,"This is a terrible DVD for the following reasons: The ""countdown"" for each film usually gives very little overall information and there is no standardization of the information given, such as the main stars for each film, year made, etc.

The programming for playing the DVD is very user unfriendly...for example, when playing the trailers, one must select each trailer individually, without the option of selecting ""Play All"".  After each trailer is played the cursor is reset to the beginning rather than sequencing to the next unplayed trailer.

The frenetic graphics and noisy interlude music are very annoying, distracting and don't fit with the subject matter.  Whoever produced this DVD was simply trying to make a splashy show on the screen.

The type face and font are quite illegible and hard to read, especially the screen for selecting the trailers.

Another aggravation: if you don't promptly make an intermediate selection, the DVD defaults to the main selection screen, with its annoying music.

There was very little critics' commentary, unless you count that quoted in the trailers.

All in all an almost worthless, hyped, barely-informative DVD.",1108944000,13,1163,5.248648648648649
8007160,2,B00016117O,"Being a non-american myself, I noticed one thing missing from this top 100 - non-american films! Not even one! Not just foreign language films, but even non-american english speaking films (from England, Australia etc) This should be titled ""Top 100 AMERICAN films of all time"". I at least expected Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" seeing as many critics say this is the best film of all time - but no. Very disppointing, especially as I watched the Australian dvd release of this. I recommend buying the book ""1001 films you must see before you die"". An execellent book with many non-american films and a wide range of genres and good mix between blockbuster and art-house movies. Also has many more newer films than this top 100 dvd. One plus for this dvd (as someone else mentioned) are the trailers (for mostly older movies 1910's to 1950's) which was a great idea. I think the IMDB top 250 is way more credible than this top 100, and if I were a film critic I'd be embarassed by this list not including non-american films - america is not ""the world"", as we so often see or are led to believe with american television.",1092182400,6,1117,4.618090452261306
8007161,2,B00016117O,"I did not care for this DVD set at all.  The list itself accounts for less than an hour of the running time.  They spend less than 30 seconds on each film, and a good portion of that time is spent on the numbers between the screen.  The commentator has no special insight and mostly recites well-known facts about each film.

As for the films themselves, the selection is good.  The list mirrors AFI closely, except they completely ignore ""Schindler's List"" (AFI #9).  In its place in the top 10 is ""A Beautiful Mind"", which I loved but am a little wary about putting it that high.  They also bypass ""The Third Man"" and put in ""The Matrix"" around its position.  I am very doubtful that this is by critics' consensus.

There are a good number of trailers, which stops this DVD from being a complete waste.  In fact, that's about the only reason I could think of to buy.  Just a few things to keep in mind if you're considering buying this.",1091750400,4,938,4.364161849710983
8007162,5,B00016117O,"This double DVD set is fantastic!  I teach a college course in film history, and I've just started showing this program to my students, AND THEY LOVE IT!  There's great scenes from the movies and information that I actually teach the students, and stuff I didn't even know.
I highly recommend this show if you love movies of all sorts.  From 'Aliens' to 'Casablanca' - this show has it all.  Now, how in the hell do you solve a problem like Maria?",1081814400,4,447,4.414634146341464
