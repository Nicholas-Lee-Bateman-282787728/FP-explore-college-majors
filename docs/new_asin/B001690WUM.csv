8585330,1,B001690WUM,"I was looking for movies our whole family could enjoy together, and I bought this collection for my family because I of the Dove ""Family Approved"" seal.  I could not be more disappointed.

Due to graphic violence, ""Merlin's Apprentice"" is only suitable for an older audience.  This is most definitely NOT appropriate for younger children.

""The Ranger"" and ""Follow the River"" do not have broad appeal for a range of ages, so these do not make good family movies.  Younger children would find them dull, hard to follow, and unappealing.

""Voyage of the Unicorn"" is the only movie in this collection that both appeals to children and is unobjectionable.  Unfortunately, the quality of the movie left Mom and Dad rolling our eyes in boredom and disgust.  Why is it that morally acceptable films are so often poorly made?

We got this collection for our children for Christmas and it ended up in the trash can 10 days later.  If you are looking for good family films, keep looking.",1388880000,,977,4.761904761904762
