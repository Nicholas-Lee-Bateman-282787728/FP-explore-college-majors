8088835,2,B000BMCXXY,Waxing techniques are not as good as expected.,1463788800,,46,4.875
8088836,3,B000BMCXXY,"I think it does the job, just seems a little high in price for being so old and out dated. I could have saved money and just watch Jack Dunn on Youtube",1461542400,,151,3.75
8088837,5,B000BMCXXY,"This video was informative coming from an Esthetician. Five star worthy bc it's not a lot of information and techniques circulating the business. Especially for male waxing. I really felt like a lot of areas I forgot men waxed, this video covered. This is something that will continuously be reviewed bc it's helpful. In the waxing world there are many different techniques and what works for one doesn't work for others. Not right or wrong more so technique. I don't use the wax that they used on the video but have in the past. However that doesn't take away from the tutorial.",1456790400,,579,4.686274509803922

8088840,3,B000BMCXXY,Decent educational video. Techniques are effective but not necessarily exciting.,1455235200,,80,7.1
8088841,5,B000BMCXXY,Great thorough video.  A novice Aesthetician will learn a lot and an experienced Aesthetician will as well. The video format is clear and concise.  This dvd can be used along side classroom instruction or as review. I highly recommend this for anyone wanting to learn about men's waxing techniques.,1454284800,,298,5.061224489795919
8088842,5,B000BMCXXY,"This DVD is very detailed with easy to follow instructions of the waxing process for men's bodies. I recommend it for any cosmetology student that wants to become proficient at waxing. It is a great idea if you watch it several times to really get a grasp of the techniques covered. That way when you start you will already have a solid understanding of what you will be doing. The more you watch it the better prepared and more comfortable you will feel when you begin doing male waxing. I purchased this DVD before I started at my cosmetology school and it really helped me to feel more comfortable. You should also get this DVD if you are considering going into this line of work. You can see what it's all about and decide if it is what you really want to do. Either way, I think you will be happy with your purchase.",1411948800,,821,4.337662337662338
8088843,4,B000BMCXXY,"I love that the video took me step-by-step through each body part, including a male brazilian. The one thing that I desired to see (that was not in the video) was the products that they would use for the different skin types. Overall, I would recommend this video to a friend.",1404691200,,276,4.431372549019608
