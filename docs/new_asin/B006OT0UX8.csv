8502366,5,B006OT0UX8,"While searching Amazon, for a 50's Classic TV show, known as: ""WHAT'S MY LINE"", I saw this DVD: ""PEOPLE ARE FUNNY 16 episodes on 3 discs (1946)"" with Art Linkletter, I decided to surf the net and read the reviews, which are very good. I went ahead and purchased the DVD from Amazon. My family and I, were surprisingly surprised! The variety of this excellent show, is good clean fun, the situations in which people find themselves are really funny, and, most importantly there is no vulgarity, of any kind. Good Print and good Audio considering the period. If I could give this program 10 stars, I would. I definitely recommend it...I hope to see the release of other seasons, of this classic tv show in the near future.",1343952000,14,720,4.589147286821706
