 Fans of Romy Schneider, this is a must have. In her last film, before her tragic death, she performs in a dual role that proves she was not just a beautiful face. An extraordinary performance in this mysterious political drama, she left fans with a hauntingly beautiful film; one you may think about for quite some time after the view. Her co-stars, Michel Piccoli, Helmut Grien, and Gerard Klein also add their wonderful talents to the film, and of course an appearance from Maria Schell is always welcome in any film.

 Schneider is Elsa Wiener and Lina Baumstein. The latter being the very lovely wife of  modern day international political leader for solidarity, Max Baumstein, who is on trial for murder. His story unfolds in the courtroom. It is one of sadness and strife, as he relates how, when just a young boy, he was beaten and left homeless by the Nazi's in pre-war Germany. Taken in by Michele and Elsa Wiener, he becomes like a son to them. But soon the Nazi's are chasing them down as well. Michele sends Elsa and Max to Paris, and promises to be with them soon. Elsa and young Max find freedom there and grow close as mother and son. Elsa is a strong and wonderful woman in many ways. She does everything in her power to reunite with her love Michele again.

 It's a touching and thought provoking film. This quiet drama had me glued to the set. Schneider portrays both women with a wonderful passion. There where times when the story seemed to move a little slowly, but the great performances, most notable Schneider, made it a captivating view. Although wonderfully filmed, with a more muted tone for the sequences in the past, sometimes the story seemed to jump to a scene to quickly, and I felt I might have missed something. The film is in French with English subtitles which were very occasionally cut off on the ends or the bottom, and unless you speak French, you may miss a bit of the conversation. But even with those little things, it is still a most compelling film.

 Merci Beaucoup...enjoy....Laurie",1158278400,,2142,4.690666666666667
