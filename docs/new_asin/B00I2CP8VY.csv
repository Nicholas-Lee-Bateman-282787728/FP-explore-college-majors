8638363,5,B00I2CP8VY,"As a fan of 1970's tokusatsu, Inazuman was one of those heroes that really stuck out to me (probably because of his unique design and his funky colors), and well, I wanted to see the show. I found it without subtitles, but then... I found... this DVD! Once I had the money, I instantly bought this, and I don't regret getting it! This is the best tokusatsu DVD I ever owned! The quality of the subtitles are amazing! Plus, it also has TONS of bonus features, so that's really cool!  This is a great show, and those who are fans of 1970's tokusatsu or just a classic science fiction fan, I recommend this!",1409270400,,604,4.345132743362832
