2750846,5,B000MX7V5C,"My 16 year old daughter and I have howled nightly at this wonderfully creative show.  Every character is beloved, and contribute to this amazing ensemble cast. We're hoping there's a Season 5, and yes, even a Season 6.  It has been a joy and a great bonding opportunity!!!  Why didn't more people see this show?",1181347200,,311,4.618181818181818
2750847,5,B000MX7V5C,"I love this show, it never gets bad. I noticed they removed the play all function on the 4th season, thats a bummer, other than that good as always.",1181347200,,148,4.137931034482759
2750848,5,B000MX7V5C,"I cannot complain or at least I should not.  Having the forth season released on DVD and on my BIRTHDAY is a great gift for a fan who's alltime favorite show is Wings.  The show itself is sooooo good.  Season 4 is not my favorite season but even then my family spent the entire weekend watching and laughing and rewatching.  My 15 and 11 year boys think this show is one of the funniest they've ever seen. And it's not crude, no nudity, no real locker room humor.  Just good clean fun...

The DVD itself is ridiculously amateur.  There is no option to play the entire DVD (as has previously been mentioned) no extras such as interviews or bloopers. No tweaking of the video or sound quality.

Nothing that a real Wings fan would love to see just because the series itself is soooo dearly missed and the DVD releases are too few and far between.

During it's run this show NEVER got the accolades it deserved other than from it's die hard and dedicated fans.  Now, in DVD it's being shorted again.  Again, I don't want to sound like I'm complaining as ANY Wings is better than none and certainly better than the DOZENS of videotapes I have of this show that sit in my basement unwatched.  But one would think that the tenth year anniversary of the end of the show might warrant a better video release than simply a cd in a box.

Lastly, I cannot wait to see Tim Daly on his new show.  He's had three he's worked hard on and have not succeeded.  It's a shame that so many of this talented ensemble have had such a hard time finding big hits after this show.  Kudos to Tony and Thomas for their major successes.  Hopefully third time is a charm for Tim.",1180396800,5,1650,4.305194805194805
2750849,3,B000MX7V5C,"After waiting for them to release Season 4 and the rest of the Seasons, I received Season 4 and they have removed the ""play all"" option from the menu. I have Seasons 1-4 now and want them all but I am already tire of waiting and now they have taken that option alway also. What will they do next to discourage people from buying these and just give up.",1179619200,,352,4.115942028985507
2750850,5,B000MX7V5C,"I remember watching this show in the 90's. It is really the only sit-com that I can think of that I really truly enjoyed enough to watch every week.

Then, with syndication in the mid to late 90's I got to watch it all over again.

Well, now they have finally come to their senses and have started releasing the show on DVD. All I can say is it's about time. This was the funniest show of the 90's and it is my personal favorite sit-com of all time.

It just doesn't get any better. The characters are great; Joe, the anal and overly sensitive older brother; Brian, the flyboy (literally and figuratively); Helen, the quick-witted, smart-mouthed, lifelong friend; Fay, the (somewhat disfunctional) mother figure to everyone; Roy, the competition, a pain in the butt, but still always around causing trouble; and my personal favorites, Lowell and Antonio, Lowell being the village idiot that's good with a wrench but bad with everything else, and Antonio, the Italian cabby with a heart of gold but a long-fuse and a sarcastic, cynical outlook.

I LOVE THIS SHOW. To the producers, thank you, thank you, thank you!!!",1178755200,11,1115,4.731958762886598
2750851,5,B000MX7V5C,"Why, oh why did they take Wings off the air?  It is my favorite show and I was so happy that it is finally on DVD. Have Seasons 1, 2, & 3 and looking forward to collecting the remaining seasons, so hurry up and release them.",1178409600,3,224,3.869565217391304
2750872,5,B000MX7V5C,Excellent DVD set - great season. I have the complete series.,1419120000,,61,4.636363636363637

2750874,5,B000MX7V5C,I love Wings and the characters and the storylines.  This was a hilarious show with great actors and actresses! Love watching it over and over!,1395964800,,143,4.72
2750875,5,B000MX7V5C,"More funny episodes in season 4.  My only complaint in season 4 is the introduction of a woman named Alex into the cast.  She plays the part of a helicopter pilot and is not funny at all.  Both of the Hackett brothers fall for her and I'm not sure why.  All she does is tout her intelligence and independence and complain when guys look at her or pay her a compliment.  Girls like this are no fun on TV or real life.  Thankfully, she only lasts for two seasons and is mercifully written off.  Very funny season nonetheless.  Season 4 highlights: ""Mathers of the Heart"", Lowell asks Helen out and Helen accepts out of pity.  The tables turn when Helen enjoys herself and Lowell is bored to tears.  ""The Gift: Parts 1 and 2"", Joe and Brian put a 2nd mortgage on their house to buy Helen a new Cello.  Helen is then forced to join a string quartet with creepy members.  The part where Brian pretends to trip and fall on the new Cello has to be among the funniest TV moments EVER!  ""I Love Brian"", a not-so-subtle nod to ""I Love Lucy"".  Very funny!",1383436800,,1044,4.260204081632653
2750876,5,B000MX7V5C,Bought this for my Son-in-Law and he loves it. Wings is one of his favorite series. He likes to watch it over and over.,1366329600,,119,4.0
2750877,5,B000MX7V5C,"This season is as good as the previous 3.  If you need a good laugh,watch Wings and enjoy! Laughter is the best medicine.",1366070400,,121,4.260869565217392
2750878,5,B000MX7V5C,I loved this series when it was on the network.  There is nothing to compare with it on the air now.,1364428800,,100,3.761904761904762
2750879,5,B000MX7V5C,"I love Wings, have recently seen it on TV and am happy to have these videos to watch all the episodes I missed",1362355200,,110,3.8260869565217392
2750880,4,B000MX7V5C,Funny does not do this series Justice. These actors work so well together that you are convinced that it could be a real working environment.,1360281600,,141,4.68
2750891,5,B000MX7V5C,"My husband loved this gift, as it is one of his favorite sitcoms and he has all the seasons before this one. He rated it 5 stars.",1356393600,,129,3.814814814814815
2750892,5,B000MX7V5C,I love wings. It is one of my alltime favorite sitcoms. And by this time it was a well oiled machine of laughmaking. The alex character was around as a love interest for brian and the cast was doing a fine job. the ratings remained strong too. Wings is still on tv in reruns and it's on reelz channel these days. (2012) 22 years after it debuted! If you need a good laugh then this is a good one to grab. The dvd's look decent and the set is bare bones. But this show has the chops to get  you laughing and will be fondly remembered for decades to come. So get your wings today.,1345248000,,578,4.026086956521739
2750893,5,B000MX7V5C,"The first 5 seasons of Wings are classic and the final 3 are still pretty good.
Season 4 is without a doubt the best season of the entire series.
It's the season where the cast was really peaking with their characters and the writing was in it's prime.
There are more classic episodes from this season than any other.
Most shows usually peak around seasons 4 and 5 in my opinion.",1301270400,,379,4.352112676056338
2750894,5,B000MX7V5C,I Love this show it is so fun to watch! It makes me laugh all the time! Season 4 definetly went a different route in some respects than the first 3 seasons. I really liked Alex for Brian it is just sad that she doesn't stay with him. But I do love the Joe/Helen story as well that is fun to see unfold.,1278979200,,302,3.8095238095238093
2750895,5,B000MX7V5C,This has always been one of my favorite shows. It's funny and the actor's are all great. The writers of this show had to be good as well because they have some great lines and antics. One season is as good as the next and I watch them all the time. I would recommend these DVD's for anyone that wants some great entertainment. Thanks,1275609600,,333,4.21875
2750896,5,B000MX7V5C,"I first watched wings on tv in the states while visiting my brother it was funny but respectful any one in any age can watch but I think when thomas hayden church left the show  was never the same again it was a mistake letting him go .I own season 1 2 3 4 on dvd its a must have collection ,and I plan owning them all the 8 seasons. Some shows you never get tierd watching them to me these are cheers,sanford and son,spin city and wings .",1251504000,2,439,3.932584269662921

2750910,5,B000MX7V5C,"It could be a case of nostalgia but I love WINGS! This season the writing and comedy is better than ever! With the emergence of Alex, a love interest for Brian, and Antonio becoming a larger presence on the show season 5 really takes off. Delightful, charming, and always funny Wings is a hit for the whole family.",1213488000,,314,4.431034482758621
2750911,4,B000MX7V5C,"There are very competent reviews prior to this one involving plot reviews etc.  This is a well done series overall.  I didn't watch it much when it was in its intial run unless I ran across it.  Getting the series now I regret that.  Roy may be the upfront bully/weirdo but I think Fay is downright freaky-creepy (I mean that with love).  She has this possessed smile and twinkle in her eye.  I have never in real life seen a ticket agent that enthusiastic about boarding announcements and if I did I would probably run for another airline.  The relatioship between the brothers has a lot of real depth to it too.  I don't remember Helen being as physically violent either but it is refreshing to see a good-looking female character with some dimension other than just looking good.  If ever anyone needed an anger management class Helen would be at the top of the list!  My only dissapointment is that the DVD series through 4, at least, contain no extras, and starting with season 4 the ""Play All"" feature has been removed for what reason I cannot understand.  I noticed that this happens with some of the older series... Costs are minimized then features added if the series sells well.  It is unfortunate when the studios go the other way.",1211587200,,1243,4.574660633484163
2750912,5,B000MX7V5C,I think season 4 is the best so far.  I have loved this show since it was on the air.  Its great to sit and watch it without commericals and still laugh and laugh.,1202428800,,163,3.764705882352941
2750913,5,B000MX7V5C,I totally loved this show when it was on air. I am so glad that the DVD available now. I never get tired watching it. TOTALLY Awesome! I've got most laughs out of this show! Just love it.,1194220800,,187,3.9473684210526314
2750914,3,B000MX7V5C,"Wings is one of those shows that leaves you feeling good after watching an episode.  When I need to forget about the day and all of the problems in it, Wings lets me forget them.

On to the DVD features.  This DVD set features are non-existent and now has no ""ALL Play"" feature and you can't skip the end credits making you fast forward through them to get to the Main Menu to select the next episode.  The manufacturer must be getting really lazy since the DVD has nothing but episodes and removed one of the nice features from the previous Wings DVD Sets.

Disk Error: My second disk doesn't allow me to directly play the first episode correctly; it plays with no sound.  I have to skip to the next episode and then go back to the first one and now the sound plays.

Overall I'm happy with Season 4 even with the issues stated above.",1190851200,5,835,4.280254777070064
2750915,5,B000MX7V5C,"So happy to have Wings on DVD but where are the bloopers?  I have the Seinfeld DVD collection and there is always a nice long set of bloopers for each season.  You just know there were some amazing bloopers during the tapings of Wings!  If nothing else, they should release a blooper reel some day. :-)",1189641600,,302,4.357142857142857

2750918,4,B000MX7V5C,"I'm so happy that WINGS was finally released on DVD!  I've purchased the first three seasons, and eagerly await all the future seasons.  Season 4 introduces the character of Alex Lambert, although she is not in every episode.  The cast is great and continues to shine in this season.  The only downfalls of this DVD set is the lack of extras like bloopers, interviews, etc.  However, none of the other WINGS sets included these things, so no surprise that they are not here either.  Also, while I rarely if ever used ths feature of ""Play All"" on a disc, that is missing from the DVD menu screen.  I can understand how it would be easy to watch all 6 episodes on one disc, so the lack of the ""Play All"" feature is disappointing.  I remember this feature on the other sets.",1184025600,,771,4.418439716312057
2750919,4,B000MX7V5C,"Wings was never the same level of cheers or fraiser in it's day.  Instead it was the little show that could.  The comedy was always top notch, and the writing excelled.  This season brought the show together than better before.  The writers had characters down, and used that to make the most of the hilarious situations.  The introduction of Alex was a hit or miss affair.  While giving Brian a permanent love interest, her humor never properly gelled with everyone else.  However, what Brian goes through to get her attention and affection more than makes up for her.  The show is great, and comedies like this are hard to find.  Watch it!",1183939200,2,641,4.651785714285714
2750930,5,B000MX7V5C,this was one of the best sitcoms i've ever seen. the characters are so lovable and you really feel a bond with them. it has reached the point where my two sisters and i actually quote lines or jokes from our favourite episodes!,1183939200,,227,4.3023255813953485
2750931,1,B000MX7V5C,wings was my favorite program and I have purcased all of the cds starting with season 1 to season 4.  I am waiting for season 5 and 6.  Hope they will become available soon. Wings cd's can be viewed by all.,1183852800,,206,4.0

There isn't a bad episode in the bunch from Roy singing the national anthem at a sox game, the phantom of the oprha, and the love triangle with Alex, I was laughing through every moment.",1182902400,,346,4.212121212121212

2750936,4,B000MX7V5C,"My husband and I eagerly await each new DVD release of Wings, since it was taken off reruns again. I pre-ordered season 4 for his birthday gift, and it was his favorite gift- even if he had to wait 2 weeks from his birthday until it was released.

We were disappointed (again) with the DVD quality of this Paramount product. I learned after buying the previous 2 sets (Season 1&2, and Season 3) not to expect the standard fare offered on most DVD's- no bonus scenes, interviews, commentary, etc. and video/audio quality rivaling that of a VCR copy, but at LEAST there was an ""All Play"" feature offered. Now that is gone too. With a company name like ""Paramount"" you wouldn't expect faineant products / releases.

Wings is one of those shows that you either love, or forgot about and fall in love with as soon as you begin watching again. If it weren't for the loyalty of the fans, these DVD's wouldn't sell- my little sister can make better quality on her computer, and she's not a movie producer.

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE- if anyone from Paramount ever sees this- the least you can do is offer the ""All Play"" feature if you aren't willing to spend any time improving the video and audio quality.

Can't wait for Season 5- which features the BEST episode ever ""Black Eye Affair"" (ep. 6) which for some reason was never shown in re-runs.",1182816000,3,1335,4.55
