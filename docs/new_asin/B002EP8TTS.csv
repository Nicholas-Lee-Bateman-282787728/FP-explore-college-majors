8368055,4,B002EP8TTS,First movie has a shower scene with multiple topless women and a couple full frontals. This movie has the beautiful and talented Erin Brown in it and I'm a huge fan of hers. Didn't like here character was killed off so soon. A couple women are also topless only during the movie after the shower scene. The second movie has a side view full frontal and one topless women. This movie was beyond stupid.  The third movie has four women topless only multiple times . This movie would have got five stars from me if only they would have the women do full frontals. I'm being picky her but oh well.,1504396800,,593,4.342342342342342

8368057,5,B002EP8TTS,"I was completely STUNNED by how intense this thing is! Its a wild over-the-top action gorefest in a women-in-prison setting with scenes that will shock even the most jaded cult movie fan! I highly recommend this to cult movie fans looking for sheer entertainment and that 'grindhouse' movie vibe (the trailer for 'Shadow' is even made to look like a 70s grindhouse trailer). The 'Damnation' feature is outrageously non-PC with a woman getting kidnapped by a female cop, drugged by injection and taken to an underground female prison where she is forced to endure all kinds of humiliation and torments. She also has a run in with a doctor who practices the rudest abortion technique you're likely to see in a cult movie! This is really outrageous stuff that took some real guts to make! Sure to be controversial once enough people get around to watching it, this is one of those rare ones that slipped through the fence!",1265673600,6,919,4.786163522012578
