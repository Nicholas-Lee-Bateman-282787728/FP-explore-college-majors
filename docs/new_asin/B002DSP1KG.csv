3912770,5,B002DSP1KG,"Like its predecessor, the second volume of Beany and Cecil cartoons was produced by Robert Clampett, Jr., and is a heartfelt outpouring of love from a son to a father. Bob Clampett's genius lay in his ability to find humor in virtually anything and the contagious joy he evoked in bringing it to the world. He was a remarkable, seemingly endless fount of ideas, from his beginnings at Warner Bros. Cartoons to his last days. Beany and Cecil was one of his greatest successes, and I watched it faithfully for years on television.

As I grew up and learned more about Bob, I viewed his Looney Tunes with awe; they took animation to places I didn't know it could go. He was graced with superior resources in his animators, his storymen, musical director Carl Stalling, and the best voice artist of all time, Mel Blanc. But it was Bob Clampett's synthesis of these strengths that resulted in some of the greatest Hollywood cartoons ever made.

Beany and Cecil is a gentler creature, aimed as it was at children, but the wit and endless stream of ideas are unmistakably there. Beyond the cartoons themselves is a treasure trove of bonus features that bring shape and dimension to the life of a great creative force. I thank Robert Clampett, Jr., for sharing with animation lovers everywhere the life story of his father, a titan in the world of entertainment.",1256601600,12,1354,4.708860759493671
3912771,5,B002DSP1KG,"It has been decades since I have seen the ""Lost Work"" of Bob Clampett. I am ecstatic that they will be included in this DVD set. The hand-puppet shows are also great nostalgia.

In these days when TV show sets are bare of any bonus material, it is GREAT that we are being treated to an abundance of bonus goodies from the Clampett Estate collection!

I just hope the Clampett estate will release volume 3 sooner than 10 years from now!",1248048000,11,435,4.3580246913580245
3912772,3,B002DSP1KG,"I realize that this item has not been released as of this writing. While I am definitely pleased that there is enough interest in Beany and Cecil that someone feels it is financially feasible to release a second volume of the wonderful original cartoons, I found the extras on the original Special Edition to be a major chore to get through and this volume promises much more of the same. If the ""approximately 200 minutes"" of this disc  and the previous one had been filled with just the cartoon shorts, all 78 of the cartoons could probably fit into only 3 discs. Instead, after two volumes, less than one third of the shorts have been released. I'd like to live long enough to be able to see them all, but even with this release, I'm having my doubts. So....  Cartoons: 5 stars; Extras: based on the similarity from the description to the extras on the previous disk, 2 stars. I'm willing to stand corrected if these extras do turn out to be not so similar to those on the first disk.",1246060800,15,987,4.447513812154696
3912773,5,B002DSP1KG,"Bob Clampett's Beany And Cecil is the very first cartoon I remember seeing in life. I actually remember Cecil the Sea Sick Sea Serpant very well and I could not have been more than three years old maybe going on four.  I had a Cecil The Sea Sick Sea Sepant plush toy that had a ring to pull and in return he said all sorts of rediculous politically incorrect things you could never get away with saying now.

Cecil also had a lisp that made him sound so gay by todays standards..  I am happy to order this Volume 2 set since Volume one has went out of print and now people want tons of money for it.  I'll settle for Volume 2 since my memories of Cecil the Sea Sick Sea Sepant are so stetchy at best, I won't miss volume one.

Video quality is very good but not excellent on a 55 inch SAMSUNG flat panel screen.  Frame rate is good.  Audio is also acceptable.  Animation quality is good for the time it was created.  The stories are good.  I remember the stories as a kid but as an adult their are subtle adult meanings in some of the banter that I never picked up on as a kid.  You must remember that these cartoons are over 50 years old so you can expect some signs  of age even with remastering.  All in all for the money paid this Bob Clampett's Beany And Cecil, Vol. 2 is a good value for the money.",1412899200,,1304,4.066666666666666

3912775,5,B002DSP1KG,"Such intelligence behind this series. It really is sophisticated and a joy to watch.  Children and their parents will have a lovely
time watching this series together.",1397692800,,167,5.185185185185185
3912776,5,B002DSP1KG,"So much fun to watch once again. Worth the price for Clampett fiends. A lot of wonderful inside information. The puppets and the early '50s so very different and alien seeming compared to today with all its so called sophistication and CGI. Just plain simple entertainment for a simple child's' world. Hard to believe it ever existed. Enjoy going back there, it's still a lot of fun.",1397260800,,383,4.731343283582089

3912778,5,B002DSP1KG,Great childhood flashback of favorite cartoon from a simplier time before computer animation. Fun to share with the current generation.,1386720000,,135,5.8
3912779,5,B002DSP1KG,"I have tried to watch for this to be released on DVD for so long.  I didn't know they had done it.  Watching it took me back to Saturday mornings when Saturday mornings were synonymous with cartoons.  Dorky as it might appear now, it was awesome then.  I even had the box game.  A real find.",1379635200,,291,4.125
3912780,5,B002DSP1KG,"This DVD is great.  The one with Peepin Tom on it.  It's hilarious. I even bought a copy for my son, since I had some of these cartoons on VHS and he was familiar with Beanie & Cecil.  :)",1374278400,,187,3.7435897435897436
3912781,3,B002DSP1KG,"Okay, they're all still around, with all the silly puns, double entendres, metaphorically marvelous plots and zany antics that I loved them for as a kid. And this time, no tape to rewind, no commercials to give your brain a rest. My wager is this: If you can stand to watch more that a half dozen of these cartoons at one sitting  AND you can stand hearing that silly theme song more than twice an hour...well, your a more devoted fan than I. It's all good, with some rare bits and examples of early works and drawings. But you can get over-saturated. Taken sparingly, a wonderful visit with what made you laugh when you were younger! Three stars for quality of reproduction and just for hanging around that long!",1373241600,,713,4.5271317829457365
3912782,5,B002DSP1KG,"Most people buy cartoon DVDs because of childhood nostalgia. I was born in 1964, so I have no memory of watching B&C. But as a true CGA (Cartoon Geek of America), I read about the show and was curious after seeing a segment on Adam West's ""Cartoons Lost and Found"" special in 1989.

Truly great cartoons stand the test of time and age beyond the children who grew up with them. This is truly the case with the rollocking adventures of Beany Boy, his sea-serpent pal Cecil, his sea-traveling Uncle Huffenpuff, the crooked Dishonest John, and the Beatnik Go Man Van Gogh (voiced in most of these by the legendary Scat Man Crothers best-remembered for Chico and the Man and Hong Kong Phooey). These tales are hilariously funny and the charaacters are appealing. The humor crosses generations and is loaded with sly winks to adults (a Davy Crockett caricature blaks at a marriage proposal by saying, ""Remember the Alimony!"" The FBi is spoofed as ""The FIB""-the notoriously humorless J. Edgar Hoover obviously missed this one).

Two episodes of the original ""Time for Beany"" puppet show from the early 1950s also appear with the original versions of the above characters. One wonders if the young Jim Henson was influenced by these for his very similar ""Sam & friends"" show a few years later. These protomuppets are not as slap-happy and fast paced as their 1960s cartoon counterparts due to the limitations of the art form, but they have a charm all their own and one could see why they captivated children AND adults (including Harpo and Groucho, Lana Turner, and even Albert Einstein who would interrupt meetings to watch the show)!

The DVD is also all about creator Bob Clampett and we get tons of extra features, including a 1946 Looney Tunes-esque cartoon ""Its a Grand Old Nag."" The shopworn plot about a movie fan (in this case a horse) who gets his wish to appear in movies only to be used as a stunt double for the most dangerous scenes would have been hack work in lesser hands, but this one has some clever twists and a trick ending. We also see scripts for never produced work including ""The Man From Mars."" It is not hard to see why this was never produced-a strange tale of Harpo Marx (who was a big Beany fan in real life) coming to earth to observe conditions for colonization and somehow averting a nuclear holocaust, mixed with live action an animation! Ambitious, but not likely to have succeeded. Another project that never got beyond the storyboard phase was ""The Monster family,"" a clear precursor to The Munsters.

With that, you can see why the kids in the title sequences of 1961 eagerly gathered around their teleivision sets to enjoy this show. Trust me, even if you weren't there at the time, you'll enjoy these too.",1365811200,2,2739,4.6881496881496885

3912784,4,B002DSP1KG,"As a kid growing up in the early Sixties (I was born in 1955) I had two abiding passions, ""monster movies"" and cartoon shows. Of the latter I'd have to admit without hesitation that Beany and Cecil were my undeniable favorites. Hard to say exactly why, but it may have had to do with creator Bob Clampett's flair for wordplay, something that was evident early in his career when he was one of the standout talents at Warner Brothers, creating classic cartoons for Looney Tunes and Merry Melodies. Beany and Cecil doesn't quite have the sheen of his earlier WB work, but what it lacks in slickness it more than makes up for in creative exuberance. Looking back I'd have to say that there was no other cartoon show offered on TV at the time that came close to having the overall zing that B & C had. Looking forward to the day when the entire run of their cartoons are finally available on DVD.",1359763200,,892,4.412121212121212

3912792,5,B002DSP1KG,"I had been waiting for so long to see a Beany & Cecil Cartoon.  I must have been about 4 years old and remembering all these years these two characters even now at almost 50 years of age.  I recently purchased this Vol. 2 Beany & Cecil show and was so excited to receive it.  Upon watching just the first cartoon, I was catapulted back to my early childhood in a flash.  What an incredible enjoyment I've had watching these cartoons which I had never even seen over the years in re-runs.  I completly recomend buying this for yourself or for your grandchildren.  They will love it too!",1259798400,2,585,4.37037037037037
