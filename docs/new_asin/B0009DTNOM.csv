8059288,5,B0009DTNOM,"I loved both of his dvds: ""Defining your space"" and ""Earning your horse's trust"". Whole new way of thinking about training. Changed my dangerous Arab into a reliable friend. Teaches you to use body language that the horse can understand. Creates cooperation instead of fear and resentment. Allows him to listen to you instead of its fight or flight instincts.",1338422400,,359,5.0
8059289,5,B0009DTNOM,"This DVD is valuable and fun. ""Pony Boy"" helps beginners be aware

of how a horse percieves our presence in their world. I recommend this DVD to anyone who is a beginner or has a horse that seems to have ""problems"" and does not seem to cooperate. Many times the horse's owner gives off negative signals and the horse is not that dumb; they pick up on these signals and react to them in the best way they know how.",1152403200,3,413,4.1625
8059290,4,B0009DTNOM,"This DVD and its companion on gaining your horse's respect gave me a good idea of how to work with one of my horses to get his respect. However, the training assumes you have access to a 50-60 ft. round pen, or some other enclosure that could subsitute for one (though it's hard to think of what a good substitute to a round pen would be for these exercises). The DVDs did convince me that a round pen would probably be a worthwhile investment, but until that happens there isn't much I can do. I do wish that he had spent a little time discussing some activities you might be able to do in the absence of a round pen.",1142985600,5,618,4.158333333333333
8059291,5,B0009DTNOM,"In ""Horse, Follow Closely"" GaWaNi Pony Boy introduced you to Native American views and techniques of horsemanship.

In this new series, GaWaNi Pony Boy takes you deeper inside your horse's mind to understand how to establish your Relationship by understanding basic horse/herd interactions in a manner that lets you understand how important this is to the horse's (and your) wellbeing.

To get the most out of your Relationship with your horse, you have to explain to the horse in terms (s)he understands that you are worthy of his/her respect, and that it is in his/her 'best interest' to respect your requests. This video does this in a 'hands on' style. GaWaNi Pony Boy explains the concepts to you you as he demonstrates the concepts and what you are looking for in a response from your horse, as well as how to recognize when you have the correct response from your horse.

8059292,5,B0009DTNOM,"I bought Episode 2 first in this series, and have already made incredible headway with my horse - I did not realize how clearly I could communicate with my mare after just a few times following Pony's advice. I have always been a skeptic, and really have been disppointed with most of my horse training DVD purchases, poor quality to say the least. I should have known that PonyBoy would come out with a horse training series that would surpass anything else available out there! I really enjoyed the professional presentation, time was obviously taken to make this easy to watch, understand as well as enjoy -( if you an out-take fan, get ready to laugh!) Nice to see a famous horse trainer be real, down to earth and one of us. Pony can really teach well, you can understand him, and he not only explains exactly what he is doing at that moment, but WHY he is doing it, and it all makes perfect sense. Overall, this is a fine quality item from the man who has always done things top notch with all of his other books and DVD's - 2 thumbs up!",1116547200,5,1043,4.3538461538461535
8059293,5,B0009DTNOM,"Over the years, I have seen a lot of horse training videos - this DVD  is just so ahead of the rest of them, it's not even fair to compare. I am really  looking forward to the next nine episodes, and I am already making real progress with my horse. Not only is the production professional, it really kept my interest. Seeing GaWaNi go through each step while explaining exactly what he and the horse were doing was extremely helpful - I finally ""get it""! No bells or whistles, this is in to-the-point horse training at it's best, I recommend this DVD to any equestrian ready to move into the most common sense approach I have ever used - and the results are amazing to see. I feel as though I have accomplished so much, and realize I can do this on my own without buying a bunch of merchandise I don't need.

The extra half hour of footage really highlights the details, and helped me to get started, and the outtakes are hilarious!",1116547200,7,932,4.344827586206897
8059294,5,B0009DTNOM,"After many years of looking for a great horse training DVD, Ponyboy has finally put out exactly what I'm looking for.  The Simple Truth About Horses series breaks the complexities of horse training down into very easy to understand pieces, and also gives you very practical exercises so that you and your horse can quickly master real-life-situation skills.  The DVD is great to watch all the way through, and is also set up well to use as a video reference manual.  This is the first part of a series, and I can't wait for the next few to come out.",1116547200,7,549,4.47
