7978296,5,B00007LZ7I,"Basil Rathbone set the bar for cinematic Sherlock, and who can hold it against Nigel Bruce that he and most subsequent Watsons are far too old for the 30-something fellow he is when we first meet him in the stories? He was consistently, and wrongly, played as an old fart in the flicks.",1495929600,,286,4.415094339622642
7978297,4,B00007LZ7I,I have been I fan of the old Sherlock Holmes movies for more years than I care to remember.  They aren't meant to be analyzed for perfection but just to be enjoyed.  This was one of the stories that I had always liked because of all of the different characters involved.. I was happy to see it available for instant video.,1493769600,,322,4.262295081967213

7978300,3,B00007LZ7I,"Not one of the best Holmes movies. As my esteemed colleague notes below, the story is too similar to ""And Then There Were None"" (filmed as ""Ten Little Indians""). The print looks good though, exceptionally clear for its age. I wouldn't have thought I would give a 3-star rating to a Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce episode, but the plot is pretty bad.",1487030400,,345,4.672131147540983
7978301,2,B00007LZ7I,"Sherlock Holmes in The House of Fear, 1945 film

It begins on the west coast of Scotland at the grin old house called Drearcliff. The Good Comrades Club have a dinner. A man receives a letter, later he has an auto accident. Next week another letter arrives. Mr. Chalmers visits Sherlock Holmes to tell about this club. They formed a pact where their insurance would go to the surviving members. [Implausible?] Holmes takes the case and travels to Scotland with Dr. Watson. Dr. Merrivale is in that photograph of the members. Dont be talking to strangers says a father to his daughter. There is another murder! A body was burned to a crisp, only identified by his cuff links. Mr. Guy Davis received a letter. No telephone at this house. Can you deduce the murderer by his looks? Who suggested they change their insurance policy?

Next morning Holmes talks to the members. There is a needle in one chair! Is it poisoned? Yes! Later that evening a man finds a poison in his drink! Mrs. Monteith brings a letter to Cosgrave. The field is narrowing down says Watson. Too many clues? Who attacked Watson at night? Inspector Lestrade arrives. Then there is an attack on Merrivale! Where is Cosgrave? The hear an explosion! Only a ring identifies Cosgraves body. Can footprints identify the murderer? Quite a knotty problem says Watson. Then another letter arrives for Captain Simpson. Lestrade sees Holmes searching for something. Outside Holmes and Watson follow footprints in the sand; is this a trap? When they return they find Simpson missing. Where is he? Found on the beach, the body is mutilated with clean cuts. Inspector Lestrade gets a letter from a man in the village. Holmes suspected something.

There is a storm at night. [Note the lack of electricity, only lanterns provide light at night.] Where are the two remaining members? Watson hears a knock at the door, then fires a pistol at shadows. Holmes and Lestrade return. Who brought that note to Drearcliff? An owl provides comedy. Who? Holmes discovers a buried secret! Is the last man alive the murderer? Lestrade thinks so. Watson notices a missing item. Holmes goes to search for Watson. Lestrade orders hands up! The mystery is solved, a plot for insurance money! Holmes saved the intended scapegoat, now the guilty will be punished for MacGregors murder. Watson explains how the disappearance was done. Holmes explains how the tattoo was created for forged evidence; he could determine its age.

This story echoes the 1933 movie A Study in Scarlet with its deaths of club members. The idea of a warning message comes from The Adventure of the Five Orange Pips, but not the plot. It reminds me of Agatha Christies novel Ten Little Indians (or And Then There Were None), which was the better story. This is worth watching but seems below average. The setting suggests a lower budget. The story of men living in an isolated house seems implausible and unlikely in the real world. Murder for insurance goes back to the 19th century, as for William Palmer, H. H. Holmes, and others. I think Insurance Companies keep records and check for this kind of fraud. The movie Double Indemnity is one example. There is a dark tone to most of the video. Note their right to keep and bear arms.",1454371200,,3243,4.785714285714286
