4215765,4,B003X375JA,"the movie is very good. It is about someone with chronic bad luck, that is taking everything with a smile. Quinn is playing it admirably. It also is one of the movies that Anthony Quinn starred that I did not know existed, while I was living in Romania. Highly recommended. I hope it will be transferred on BD, I would have to buy it again. FYI: only Korean subtitles. Region 0.",1306281600,7,378,4.338028169014085

4215772,5,B003X375JA,"Loved The 25th Hour since I saw it when it first came out. Anthony Quinn is wonderful as a simple Rumanian peasant who loves everybody and wants only to return to his lovely wife Virna Lisi, but is instead swept away on a picaresque journey where he is first mislabeled a Jew, then a Hungarian agent, then member of some preposterous Aryan subspecies by a Nazi scientist  all ending in being accused of war crimes  and after finally being acquitted after the war, is restored to his family.",1444867200,2,490,4.556818181818182

4215779,5,B003X375JA,"Here again we are treated to the brilliant characterizations we have come to expect from Mr. Quinn.  It is a story of a simple farmer caught up in the lust and power owned by minor authorities in Roumania at the beginning of W W 2.  His adventures, so to speak, streched out over the war and then some are somewhat unbelieveable,  but in wartime what is unbelievable?  Lisi portrays his strong willed wife who suffers similar fates as her husband but is there for him when he finally returns home.  A wonderful film, brilliantly acted in performances to be savored always.",1430179200,,572,4.623762376237623
4215780,5,B003X375JA,One of my most favorite movie. Great acting great story,1429833600,,55,4.6
4215781,5,B003X375JA,The best movie Anthony Quinn ever made!  I read one time that it was his favorite.  I could never find it as a VHS tape and was so pleased to find it had been digitized.,1425168000,,169,3.8
4215782,5,B003X375JA,"Anthony Quinn is neglected by movie studios these days. It is very hard to find his work in US with the exception of a few classics such as ""La Strada"" and ""Zorba the Greek"". This release of ""The 25th Hour"" also reminded me a bit of this by the use of what seems to be off-the-shelf writable DVD media, based on the bluish hue of the DVD surface. This aspect aside, however, the image quality was good and English subtitles were also available.

The story of the movie is quite unique and mixes drama and humor just as they happen in real life. The starting plot is simple: Quinn plays Johann Moritz, a Romanian farmer that is happily married to beautiful Suzanna (Virna Lisi). The village chief of police wants Johann out of the way so he can get his chance with Suzanna. To this effect, he denounces Johann as being Jewish, so that he would get deported to a labor camp. The movie then chronicles Johann's adventures as he is trying to get back to his family. Johann is a hard working person but he is also very naive, so his interaction with the tragic events around him often leads to comic results that reminded me of two later films: ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Life is Beautiful"". At a high level, the movie is an indiction of war and of how it either erases individuals or it rewrites them for its own purpose -  Johann's identity frequently changes according to the changing circumstances - going into details would spoil the movie, but just pay close attention to the how his first name is changed across the story.

In terms of authenticity,the initial scenes were filmed in Yugoslavia, not Romania, so the architecture, dressing, music, and dancing are not exactly Romanian, but they are close enough. Most of the plot seems historically plausible and worthy of an ""inspired from real events"" label.

I had seen this movie a long time ago and only had vague memories of it when I ordered it on DVD. I could have been disappointed after watching it again after so many years, but on the contrary, I appreciated it even more, Despite its age, its storytelling has a timeless quality that make it a must-see classic.",1424217600,5,2117,4.563157894736842
4215783,5,B003X375JA,"Already having written a review of this 1967 major hit for Anthony Quinn and Virna Lisi (giving two of their best performances in a film directed by Henri Verneuil (who later teamed with Quinn for another film, 1969's ""Guns for San Sebastien"" co-starring Charles Bronson and Anjanette Comer) for a Korean pressing, please let me say this Warner Archives edition does the film the justice it should have (for a MOD entry).  The Metrocolor is fabulous and since Warner Archive are the pioneers of the MOD capability, they do it better than any of the other followers.  Although I have been advised to the contrary by some of my Jewish friends I've shared viewings of the film with, I found this to be one of the better depictions of the Holocaust.  It is certainly life-affirming, although,  ""Judgment at Nuremburg"" perhaps the finest.  But anyone appreciating Carlo Ponti's production of ""The 25th Hour"" will want this definitive edition.

4215789,4,B003X375JA,I saw this on TV years ago and found it touching. Anthony Quinn is believable as a simple man who gets caught up in madness.,1412553600,,124,4.0

4215791,3,B003X375JA,"""The 25th Hour"" is a five star film, a testament to the human spirit as the characters of the Romanian couple played by Anthony Quinn and Virna Lisi are so inspiring and touching and excellently performed. My complaint is the washed out color and lack of definition of the picture on this Korean edition which is the only other way I know how to get a copy (except perhaps through European Trash Cinema).  The Koreans have taken off the MGM logo and the film was originally in Metrocolor and Franscope and this edition also is in Fullscreen.  Directed extremely well by Henri Verneuil (""The Burglars;"" ""The Sicilian Clan""), it is based on the novel by Constatin-Virgil Gheorghiu and the screenplay is by Henri Verneuil, Francois Boyer and Wolf Markowitz.  The Carlo Ponti production, originally filmed in English also stars Gregoire Aslan, Dalio, Serge Reggiani and Michael Redgrave.  It is at times brilliant and one of the best movies about the Holocaust there ever has been.  Beautiful cinematography by Andreas Winding and original music by Georges Delerue, with expert film editing by Francoise Bonnot.  Why MGM has not put out a decent edition is a crime.  This is an extraordinary film and should be seen and appreciated.  Just wish we didn't have to settle for less.  NTSC.",1408147200,,1281,4.893518518518518

It broke my heart as a kid and it broke my heart as an adult.  It's a war story.  It's a love story.  It's a life story.  I'm so glad this movie was available today so that I could measure my youthful feelings against my adult sensibilities.  It stands the test of time.",1395878400,2,391,4.202702702702703
4215796,5,B003X375JA,"A rather unfortunate story of a happy simple man that gets caught up in the horrors of War not realizing why things are happening to him.  This is a story that ends up as things should be, but a price is always paid for by the the common man, not the Governments.

I gave it 5 stars because it was a heartfelt story, and the acting by Quinn was great. I would recommend this movie to all teen and above ages.",1392595200,2,408,4.0246913580246915

4215799,5,B003X375JA,Rather different from the book but a very good story as told. Well produced and well performed. It is important to know the time and context of the events to appreciate it; early in the Nazi move through Europe and the rounding up of Jews as seen through the eyes of the Romanian author. Surprising twists but not as intricate as the book.,1377475200,3,339,4.396825396825397

4215805,5,B003X375JA,"This is an interesting story.  I just wondered if it is a true story.  Anthony Quinn is made a prison guard and saves several Jews from execution as they escape the concentration camp together as the war is ending.  The Jews do help him and give him some gold coins which are taken from him when he is captured by the Germans.  He would have been freed except his picture was on the magazine.  Also, one of the Jews he saved testified for him.  I have a feeling that this story has no basis in fact but the incidents along the way probably happened to someone, just not all to the same person.  When Anthony Quinns picture appears on the cover of the magazine his wife is forced to leave the village.  If I ever find the VHS recording I will post a message and will make it available for $3.00 on DVD as long as it does not have a copywright problem.",1354406400,,850,4.171779141104294

Finally, I purchased this dvd copy and would say that whole film provides a different perspective to WW11, which most people don't know about.  Anthony Quinn's performance as a Romanian peasant of German descent, caught up in maelstrom not of his making, is brilliant.  I highly recommend this one for WW11 history buffs.",1504396800,,427,4.808219178082192

8407780,5,B003X375JA,"An excellent film that includes one of Anthony Quinn's greatest and perhaps least known performances today as this is a rarely shown film on tv.
Quinn plays Johann Moritz, a Romanian peasant who through a series of circumstances is cast off on a journey that takes him through the a maze  of intense experiences through World War 2-torn Europe. This film so well, co-written and directed by Henri Verneuil who creates a story that is powerfully dramatic, moving and at times sadly humorous and satirical. It provides insights into the horror and ironies of war and also into unknown depths of the human spirit.
Moritz is an everyman riding on the crest of the wave of fate that twists and turns him and his family throughout the war years. How it will end, I will not say. But do pay the money to buy this dvd. This is a rare film, finely directed, written and with an amazing ensemble of actors. Aside from Quinn's outstanding performance, there is Virna Lisi who proved way back then that she was not only one of the most beautiful women in film but a wonderful actress. Fine cameos by Michael Redgrave and Alexander Knox bookend an excellent ensemble that bring vitality and added depth and humanity to this powerful story. This is an extraordinary film that needs to be recognized for the fine cinematic experience that it is.",1490054400,,1330,4.683760683760684
