8039896,1,B00067VVWI,"The Criticism I make is
 A/ About the product, it being incomplete and quite heavily and clumsily edited.
 B/ About your process and system response and management. In response to my complaint, you sent another copy(very efficiently and quickly),but the product was a copy of the initial incomplete one. this means no one took notice of the details of my initial complaint which actually detailed the missing scenes. So,you have a beautifully efficient system but one that lacks comprehension.
 I will continue trading with Amazon because you are very helpful, but every system needs an understanding and comprehending surviellance,not just a mechanical response.
 Regards,
 John and Veronica Arendse.",1273363200,,701,5.453703703703703
8039897,5,B00067VVWI,"This is a review for the dvd as pictured which is presented by MOVIE VENTURES. BOOTS & SADLES is an acceptable version; a little grainy, a little soft, but still pretty good overall. The real deal here is a PRISTINE, LOOKS AS THOUGH IT WERE SHOT YESTERDAY version of RIDERS OF THE WHISTLING PINES! This one is as good as the re-mastered Autry-authorized films (from IMAGE)!
Now, I got mine in a discount bin & the $17+ bucks being asked here seems a little steep. So if you go through another source be sure you're getting the version as pictured above as MOVIE VENTURES PRESENTS.
This is a GREAT buy that can probably be had for peanuts. Shop wisely.",1182816000,3,651,4.4789915966386555
