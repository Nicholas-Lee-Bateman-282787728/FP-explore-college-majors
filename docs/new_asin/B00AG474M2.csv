8551219,4,B00AG474M2,"This DVD is focused on the excellent undefeated 2012 season of Ohio State.  ... and of course, the amazing Devon Smith one-hander is nicely featured.  Though Buckeye fans are likely to enjoy this DVD and the highlights are well-selected, overall production values are generally poor.  Please view the 4-star rating as one from a fan's perspective, rather than that of a video critic.

I will separately comment on the production quality, and the game summaries....

Game Summaries: The DVD presents highlights of all 12 games of the season, spanning just over an hour total.  Individual game highlight summaries range from 3-7 minutes.  The highlights are well selected from each of the games, and give a good picture of scoring plays, turnovers, and other significant plays.  With only a few minutes on each game, however, no single game summary delivers much of a feeling for the individual game.  Having said this, I would still expect a Buckeye fan will enjoy the game summaries.

Production: The footage is full of jaggies, and a combination of low-res footage and over-zoomed editing prevails.  The narration is merely factual and generally uninspired.  The original live play-by-play is almost all replaced by uniform narration, unfortunately removing much of the feeling of true excitement from the back-and-forth action of many of the OSU games in the 2012 season.

DVD features (ranging from 4-7 minutes each):
-Top Stories of 2012 (kind of a season highlight reel)
-All Big-Ten Performers
-Urban Meyer Interview (the interview is interesting in hearing Urban's view of the key point in OSU's season, as well as his success in having the team accept his coaching approach)
-Look ahead to 2013 (including a brief schedule preview)

General Featurettes (ranging from 1-3 minutes each):
-Game Day (new fans, and some tailgating)
-Alumni Band (with some fun footage of long time OSU Band Alumni upholding a great tradition and entertaining the crowd)
-Mickey Marotti
-Zach Boren
-Military Salute

Game Highlight Featurettes (ranging from 1-2 minutes each):
-Top Catches
-Top Hits
-Top Pass Defense
-Top Runs",1360108800,,2113,5.210059171597633
