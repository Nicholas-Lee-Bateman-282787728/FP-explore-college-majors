4706129,3,B005HWAOHK,"The tepid reviews that this 2011 dramedy is receiving have been pervasive, yet there is something innately Capraesque about Tom Hanks' sophomore directorial effort, his first since 1996's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/That-Thing-You-Do/dp/B000LC4ZHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">That Thing You Do!</a>. The movie proudly wears its heart on its sleeve, and the commitment that Hanks shows in his character's plight goes a long way to compensate for the episodic, by-the-numbers screenplay co-written by Hanks and Nia Vardalos (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Big-Fat-Greek-Wedding/dp/B00006FMUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Big Fat Greek Wedding</a>). The screenplay is what makes the film a bit disheartening to watch since its amiable nature and can-do sensibilities don't produce much in the way of compelling conflict. The concept appears timely, but the treatment feels like a Hollywood studio-manufactured version of what happens when sudden unemployment and economic hardship alter your reality.

The title character is a divorced man in his mid-fifties who is the ideal employee in a Walmart-type store after spending nearly twenty years as a cook in the Navy. Thinking he was about to win another employee of the month award, Larry finds out that he is the victim of a downsizing ostensibly due to his lack of a college degree being told he has reached his maximum growth potential with the store. In order to ensure that he never has this problem again, Larry enrolls in a local community college where is advised to take an introductory economics course and a class on public speaking where he meets a lovely but disillusioned professor named Mercedes Tainot, herself dealing with a bad marriage and a drinking problem. Larry also acquires a scooter and attracts the strictly platonic attention of a fellow student named Tania, a free spirit who is a member of a harmlessly hip scooter gang and makes him over to look more fashion forward.

Little time is spent on Larry's actual economic situation, and Hanks uses the convenient device of a pretentious loan officer (played comically by his wife, Rita Wilson) to explain what Larry has to do to curtail his sinking mortgage payments. Along the way, he finds a job as a line cook at a diner, makes new friends, and learns to loosen up a little and enjoy the small things in life. At first, Hanks as an actor appears to be in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forrest-Gump/dp/B00003CXA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forrest Gump</a>&nbsp;mode as Larry, avuncular and docile to the point of appearing mentally challenged, but then he gravitates toward his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-ve-Got-Mail/dp/B000YDBPAM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You've Got Mail</a>&nbsp;character when he sets out to win Roberts' heart. As Mercedes, Roberts seems to be sliding into middle age a lot smoother than I would have expected from an actress whose popularity peaked a decade ago. She's certainly a lot more endearing here than she was in her navel-gazing exercise last year,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eat-Pray-Love/dp/B0042816YK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eat Pray Love</a>.

Gugu Mbatha-Raw is appealing as Tania, but her character is probably the most unbelievable in the story. As Larry's constantly huckstering neighbor, Cedric the Entertainer is used primarily for comic relief, while Taraji P. Henson has a barely-there role as his perky wife. So does Pam Grier who provides her earthy presence all far too briefly as Mercedes' fellow faculty member. Bryan Cranston has the predictable role of Mercedes' porn-surfing, no-account husband and plays him exactly to formula. George Takei steals several scenes as the self-absorbed economics professor, while Wilmer Valderrama appears to be upending his role as Fez on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/That-70s-Show/dp/B0002PYS5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">That '70s Show</a>&nbsp;as Tania's innocuously jealous boyfriend. By the way, it's hard to miss Grace Gummer as one of the students since she is a carbon copy of her mother Meryl Streep's younger self. The movie rallies in the second half of its 99-minute running time, but despite a heavy likeability factor due to its stars, I wish there was less Hollywood fairy tale dust in the story.",1309737600,,4505,6.125
4706130,3,B005HWAOHK,"Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks fail to generate much chemistry in this romantic comedy about the affable, jobless Larry Crowne.  Julie and Tom are really good actors, but there wasn't that mix that makes a really good movie here. Julie looked like she could have phoned in her lines, she was not matched right with Tom Hanks. See it if you are really die hard fans of these too very good actors.  Three stars was I think really more than it was worth though. Have a great day guys.",1309737600,2,478,4.359550561797753

No established connection/attraction between Julia's hard-nosed, unhappy, college teaching character, and Tom's no-college salesman, unhappy character.

The husband was wrong and the wife is understandably upset, but there's no effort to change, support, forgive, or ask forgiveness, no attempt to save their marriage. And Larry has no problem entering into a relationship with a married woman (which he does not know is struggling).

4706173,2,B005HWAOHK,"This movie was boring and pointless. I give it 2 stars because George Takei was awesome, with that amazing voice of his. I don't want any spoilers here. It's easy to describe: set up a shallow dramatic situation, paint a portrait of a really nice guy who is going through a banal sort of crisis, throw in some dull, irritating non entities to move the plot along, and have our hero just cruise on in to exactly what he needs and wants, without opposition. Add in the pretty hilarious George Takei as a bombastic drama queen of an Economics 101 professor, and you have the feel like you have wasted time except for one really good character movie of the year.

4706184,5,B005HWAOHK,"I absolutely loved this movie.  I am a non traditional student, and can tell you that this story is similar to my own in many ways.  Tom Hanks is terrific as a middle-aged man who has been fired because he doesn't have a degree.  He goes back to college, and takes a communications class.  Enter Julia Roberts, his instructor at the local community college.  She has a bad attitude about her students, but Hank's character changes all of that in some very entertaining ways.

Good, clean (for the most part), light-hearted fun.  Suitable, and even recommended, for older children on up.  Hank's character is a very good person, and his good example shines through as the bottom line of this movie.  So in essence he teaches us all lessons in how to be kind to others, the importance of being honest and trustworthy, the importance of hard work, how to be a good friend, and finally, why we all need to be more respectful.",1464048000,5,921,4.567073170731708

4706200,4,B005HWAOHK,"I'll say first that I did not expect to like this movie very much.  From the previews I saw I expected it to be an unbelievable story thrown onto the screen to use Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks in something they could expect to do at their ages.  Frankly, Tom Hanks does not look very good but he is such a good actor that he can make us think he looks terrible one minute then convince us that he is very attractive the next minute.  He puts that talent to good use in this movie.  Without Tom Hanks, this is a crummy movie.  With Tom Hanks, it's a very enjoyable movie.  Julia Roberts plays Julia Roberts which she has done very well for a long time.  She fits this role like it was made for her, takes it and runs with it.  The two stars.  That is what this movie is all about.  It's a charming, rather fairy tale like story of college kids that actually take a older square guy into their group and he somehow fits in.  Sure, in this day and time, it's unbelievable but we want to believe that something like that could happen and we enjoy watching it on screen.  I really enjoyed this movie.  I don't even like Cedric the Entertainer and I liked him in this movie.  If you want something to just sit back and enjoy and feel good about then watch this movie.  Tom Hanks is a national treasure and should be respected as such. I do feel that this movie would have been better with a different director.  Tom Hanks just isn't a good director.  The only other movie he directed was dead boring and there are parts of this where I see that a better director would have made a big difference.",1458259200,,1589,4.191419141914191

Over repeated pay TV viewings, I've really come to appreciate it and especially how natural and unforced the romance between Hanks and Roberts is. Unlike most modern films the characters don't immediately fall into bed together and are aware of the awkwardness (and implications) of  their student/teacher relationship.

Perhaps my favorite line is when, thankful that Hanks has kept a kiss one night secret, he states he can keep a secret and Roberts states ""Gentlemen do.""

This movie needs to be seen from beginning to end and then let it marinade in your brain for a bit.  That's when you'll begin to understand it and feel the effects it has on you.  Not only is this a feel good movie, it is also a light romantic comedy and most importantly, it's a movie about the resiliency of the human spirit on a day-to-day basis.  Just when you think your life will continue along on the path you've chosen, you get downsized and find that the rug has been quite literally pulled out from under you.  Has anyone really stopped to think about what happens to a 50+ year old man in a service industry job who gets downsized?  Larry Crowne is someone quite ordinary who happens to be way past the point where he can easily switch careers.  Divorced, no children, losing his house.  All this sounds like a downer of a movie, right? But it really isn't.  Larry takes a few small but positive steps, makes a few changes in his life, and presto, a new life emerges, one more interesting than the one he's lost.  And although this movie makes you feel like everything worked out for Larry, and quite easily, it also makes you wish that life were really like this.  Get thrown an employment curve ball?  No problem.  Find yourself divorced in your 50's without a job?  No problem.  Need to find a couple women to pay attention to you?  Here are two and by the way, one of them will also supply you with a new wardrobe.  Need a more modern haircut but don't have the money for one?  No problem getting one for free and in your own home, for that matter.  Somehow this movie makes you feel that all the doo-doo life can throw at you in your 50's is very easily solved just by taking a couple college courses and buying an old scooter.  Somehow the actors in this movie make it completely believable.  Not only do they make the script work for them, they make it hum.  There are numerous instances throughout this picture where you'll find yourself feeling like you're walking right alongside Larry as he navigates those first scary steps into his new life.  I knew simply from the casting that the script has that intangible something that caused several fine actors to be in it, and they give wonderful and completely believable performances.  They make it look positively effortless.  Larry Crown is a real breath of fresh air.  See it.  It'll put you in a good mood and possibly make you sign up for a few community college courses too.",1440806400,,2657,4.41358024691358

4706261,5,B005HWAOHK,"I like this movie. You have to consider that it is a 'feel-good' movie, no doubt. Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts. How can you go wrong? Well, you can't.

Larry Crowne (Hanks) loses his job. He has to sell his house, sell his car, and go back to school. He plunges into his classes, and finds himself in a creative writing class taught by the cynical and unhappily married Professor Tainot (Julia Roberts). Over the course of the semester his unquenchable optimism and charm slowly breaks down her reserve and disdain for her teaching job, with the other students getting dragged along as well and becoming motivated in the writing class despite their initial disinterest.

Although Hanks and Roberts are the main show, the supporting cast is very good as well. Gugu Mbatha-Raw in particular is terrific as Lance's classmate ('Lance' is the name she gives to Hanks character, when her group of friends adopts him into their scooter-riding clan). Wilmer Valderrama is her boyfriend, finding her (platonic) fascination and attraction to Lance (Hanks) to be somewhat puzzling and irritating. George Takei does a great job as the finance and accounting professor. Bryan Cranston is the school dean.

4706262,4,B005HWAOHK,"Larry Crowne is a man who has made peace with midlife.  Or so he thinks.  A Navy veteran now working at a big box store, he holds the inside track for 'Employee of the Month'.  Toting a personalized coffee cup into a meeting where he thinks another honor awaits, Crowne is cruelly let go by a manager who flashes his class ring declaring 'Three years Chico State!'  (No offense intended--best wishes to the C.S. basketball team which won its first-ever NCAA West Regional Championship.  Go Wildcats!)
  Like the man who portrays him (Tom Hanks), Larry Crowne is an American who does All the Right Things.  And like other Americans caught in the economic downturn, Crowne is bewildered by the fire sale his skill set has become.  He ends up selling his house and going back to school where he meets Julia Roberts who teaches a speech course.
  Not all Crowne's tutelage takes place in the classroom.  New life lessons come from former neighbors (Cedric the Entertainer & Taraji P. Henson), fellow students (Gugu Mbatha-Raw & Wilmer Valderama), Bank Supervisor (Rita Wilson) and a Professor (George Takei).

4706276,3,B005HWAOHK,"I'm a fan of romantic comedies, and this one was fine except for one distracting, careless flaw, so I'm taking off one star for it. I'm going to describe that flaw, and I don't think it counts as a spoiler because it really has nothing to do with the plot.

Before I tell you about the flaw, let me say that there was real chemistry between the romantic leads, Hanks and Roberts. There was some good humor sprinkled throughout, and it was a little edgier and topical than most romantic comedies because it managed to include a serious theme - unemployment. As romantic comedies go, it followed a standard formula, including a ""misunderstanding"" between the romantic leads. I tend not to like rom coms that employ a misunderstanding, but it was tolerable in this one. If I described the misunderstanding it would be a spoiler, so I'll leave it at that. If you absolutely must know what I'm talking about, ask me in the comments section.

Let's talk about the flaw. When I saw it my mouth literally fell open. Oddly, none of the other people watching it with me noticed, and even when I pointed it out they didn't understand my disappointment. The other people watching were all women, by the way, though I can't see how that makes any difference. Anyway, the offending scene was meant to be humorous, but I think it backfires. Mercedes (Julia Roberts) is married to a man who has turned into a hopeless jerk. One night they eat and drink at a restaurant and they both get drunk. After dinner they get into their car, the husband drives, they get into an argument about some silly thing, Mercedes demands to get out of the car, which she does, and her drunk husband drives off without her. Larry (Tom Hanks) happens to be out driving and he sees Mercedes alone on the street late at night, so he offers to drive her home. They drive by the husband who's being arrested for drunk driving, and Mercedes is deliriously happy that her jerk of a husband is getting his just deserts.

Sure, it's meant to be funny, I understand that. But am I the only person who feels that this scene puts our romantic lead in a very bad light? Given that Mercedes has already established herself earlier in the movie as an alcoholic (that's how she's been dealing with her jerk husband), it feels like a punch in the gut to see our heroine allowing her husband to drive drunk. In my book that makes her as responsible and guilty as he is. If friends aren't supposed to let friends drive drunk, then surely spouses aren't supposed to let spouses drive drunk. If the movie wanted to show a funny scene in which the jerk husband gets his comeuppance, there were any number of other ways Hanks could have done it better. Maybe I'm being a little too PC for my own good, but drunk driving is not a joke anymore, and even if it is, I don't think it's romantic. In real life, if I were Larry and I met someone like Mercedes, and I found out that she had a habit of driving drunk, or allowing her husband to drive drunk, that would be a show-stopper.

That's my two cents; otherwise, enjoy the show! :-)",1433808000,,3072,4.451154529307282

4706292,1,B005HWAOHK,"Think to yourself: how easy would it be in your middle age to: 1) lose your career, 2) find another viable career to pursue, 3) pursue said ""career"" by heading to college which brings exquisite debt, 4) and let's not forget then facing the task of finding a JOB in this ""career"" ...all while worrying about keeping a roof over you and your family's head? And thankfully, the movie industry has brought you ""Larry Crowne"" which wraps-up a plan just like this in just over an hour and a half!

My main gripe with films like this is that the underlying message is anything but ""inspiring"" or ""up-lifting."" Rather, the message is that ONE guy manages to revamp his entire life and in the process, ""makes it"" with a bony woman who takes her fortunate job as a college professor completely for granted in the most caustic, unfunny fashion. Can you make a fresh start by going to college? Absolutely, but it's a start that is anything but ""fresh"" when you're faced with the debt afterwards. This was just another propaganda, ""kick-in-the-pants"" flick in which someone magically switches gears later in life and stumbles into an unlikely romance... while being poor and riding a scooter? I honestly have no idea how hollywood execs green-light this crap.

Some would say ""that's the magic of hollywood,"" but when you consider that Hanks wrote this and used his college time as inspiration, is it really that ""magical?"" By the same token, a real life story of someone who goes from rags to riches isn't terribly ""magical"" because they're 1 in several hundred million that accomplish it.

Anyway, commercials for this film made it look like a lighthearted rom-com, which if you can choose to be gullible enough to buy-in to the industry created by crippling student loans, then laugh away at ""Larry Crowne.""

4706328,3,B005HWAOHK,"The lightweight, feel-good saga of a man carelessly adrift in middle age without really recognizing how beleaguered he's become. A half-slate at the local community college opens new horizons and introduces him to colorful, inspirational new figures, which he takes in stride admirably. It's soft rock for the cinema, a shallow little story that's aloof and happy but not terribly gripping or important. Tom Hanks is fine in the lead role, throwing back to the classic everyman archetype that brought him fame and fortune, and his chemistry with Julia Roberts (a bitter, icy communications professor) is more comfortable and real than what we saw in their previous collaboration, 2007's Charlie Wilson's War. Beyond a few passages that may or may not have come from a pamphlet on existentialism and a few strangely unexplored plot threads, there's very little to it. Mildly funny, warm and friendly, it's also quite bland and thoroughly whitewashed.",1417392000,,949,5.25

A little too easy in places (the deteriorating marriage between Julia Roberts and Mr. Heisenberg is a little too pat).  Mr. Sulu is good as a strange economic professor, and the bank official, played by Rita Wilson is excellent.  Cedrick the Entertainer is entertaining, and the cast moves the film forward.  But the direness of the economics never impinges on the fun & games, a fault in the film, perhaps due to the choice on Nia, my big fat Greek wedding Vardalos as co-writer with Hanks.  Would that some seriousness crept into this film.  But if sunny fun about being fired, selling everything you own, getting a lower paying job, and going back to school at a fourth-rate community college is for you, then go for it.",1416787200,,794,4.717391304347826

A wonderful voyage of discovery that helps the viewer re-evaluate his/her own life for unrealized potential.

Sometimes a movie has to grow on me. I watch once and I don't like it much, but then I watch again and I'm seeing it in a different way. This is a movie I liked better the second time.

The first time I watched, Talia (Gugu Mbatha-Raw)really bothered me. She was so controlling. The way she pushed her views and tastes onto Larry got on my nerves. She was called 'an irritating free spirit' and I agreed. Weeks later, I thought I'd watch again. I felt for Larry Crowne and I enjoyed Cedric the Entertainer's character just as I did before. And this time, I could see that Talia was trying to be helpful the only way she knew how. So, when the Blu-ray went on sale, I purchased a copy - glad to make it a part of my movie collection.

He has to sell everything he has to pay his debts - even his house and scales down to a small apartment and a scooter to ride to work and school.  When someone says they don't want to be his friend - he doesn't try to win them back.  Instead, he respects their decision and just goes on living his life.

So.  Back to Larry Crowne.  This movie may not appeal to you if you've never been screwed over by incompetent and/or brutish managers.  Or if you have never had to walk away from a major purchase, like a house or a car.  Or if you have never had to start your education all over again at a college where everyone around you looks like their 12.  Or if you liked any of the Anchorman movies.  Seriously.  What, there are like two sequels to that now? Three? Who is watching those movies?  I mean, besides people on planes that (apparently) have no parachutes. On the other hand,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Other-Guys/dp/B002ZG99HC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Other Guys</a>&nbsp;which also starred Will Ferrell made me laugh so hard I inhaled my popcorn.  But just at the part where they talked about lions and tunas.  The rest was embarrassingly puerile and I refused to admit that I liked the movie to anyone because of it.  Well, except for this review.  And the people on my commute in the morning.  Also, the people in line at the last Marvel movie.  Except for those people, and this review, I have never admitted it to anyone.  And if you see it, you have my permission to also hide the fact that there were parts that had you stifling loud guffaws.

Moving on.

--- Semi weakish spoiler alerts ---

Larry Crowne was unrealistic in that hot chicks just don't take over the lives of middle-aged men even if they both attend the same community college (take over in a non-sexual way, for all of you out there thinking perv-y thoughts - and you know who you are).  However, this movie makes you think that they could.  Or that they should.  Or something.  I am a not-so-young woman, and I still think that maybe they should after seeing this movie.  It would do them both some good, I say.

On the other hand, this movie was realistic in that there are a lot of downsizing nowadays, a lot of realistic budgeting that may or may not include moving out of one's house, and a lot of rewriting of one's education so that one can realistically become employed again. All of that reality makes one think.  And forcing one to think is a moral imperative for a movie that doesn't involve CGI or Mel Gibson's bare bottom, the early years.

After seeing this (or what the heck, before seeing this, whichever is your preference), I also recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Answer-Man/dp/B002LBKDZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Answer Man</a>&nbsp;with Jeff Daniels.  Normally, I think the use of swear words is a cheat in movies.  They say to me ""Hey, let's not go to the effort of creating dialog to indicate that this character is street savvy and / or a rebel, let's just have them say f-bomb a lot.""  But in The Answer Man, there is an actual point to swear word usage and it was rather cleverly done.  My mother, who will turn off movies if there is too much swearing, enjoyed The Answer Man greatly, so... I like it, and my mom liked it.  Thus, by the transitive rule of mom-always-knows-best, you'll like it too.  And Larry Crowne, as well.  This movie here, that I am reviewing.  Both.  That one and this one.  Or either.  Also, the Lion-Tuna scene in The Other Guys.  That as well.  But not the rest of the movie.  Although there are bits and pieces here and there, so maybe you might want to watch it and just fast forward when it comes to parts that would make even a 13 year old boy wretch.  Yes.  Those two movies, and that scene.  And then the rest of that movie, minus the blech.

You should probably write all of this down before you forget it.  Otherwise, you might have to read this review again.  And frankly, I don't think either one of us could take it if you had to read it again.  Seriously.  I am openly weeping.",1397260800,,4087,4.726241134751773

I am an admitted loyal fan of Tom Hanks in any role and Julia Roberts. I find that both are exceptional actors and have yet to let me down in any role they have played to date.

Larry Crowne is a light movie that leads to the obvious bonding of two unlikely people. You know it from the beginning, even if they don't and you spend your viewing time watching, waiting and wishing for Cupid to fire the arrow. It's a light, happy girl gets boy movie.

4706428,4,B005HWAOHK,I did thoroughly enjoy this movie and would likely watch it again.  It was a good husband and wife movie.  It is nice not to watch a movie that makes me want to barf.  I do not think it is appropriate for children as the morals in it are questionable.  The theme of a woman's standing up for herself and refusing to tolerate abuse is a good one.  The attitude towards porn and the damage it does to a relationship is one that resonates with me.  One can see how the woman played by Julia Roberts finds her power and joy in life again by casting off the dead relationship tarnished by verbal and mental abuse of a husband addicted to porn and nonproductive in supporting their mutual living.  Larry Crowne played by Tom Hanks is delightful and kind to all around him as he is also breaking free from his grief and exploring new relationships.,1392422400,,841,4.352564102564102

I liked that the movie didn't have sex scenes because those are awkward to watch with your son in the room.  I saw no chemistry between Hanks and Roberts, even tho they are two excellent actors. Because we are so well aware of their stardom in real life, I found them unconvincing as average adults in an average world.  Julia Roberts' character was unappealing.

The government, who purposely caused the challenges and fleeced the middle class's market investments decided to use their movie industry to get white middle class folks to lower their expectations...this is social engineering.

Hanks plays a guy with a crappy job and living alone. Then the crappy job is gone. Why didn't Hanks work to have a better job? Why didn't Hanks save for a rainy day? Shhh, don't ask hard questions, just except it.

Instead of going after better jobs, or several crappy jobs, to pay off his debts, he goes to college (more debt) and downsizes his home and car. Oh, and for some reason is respected by some hot girl, is socially accepted in a scooter gang, and hooks up with a middle aged drunk/dreamer (Julia Roberts)...that's the movie's way of letting us know he's made the right decision.

How about this story instead: As a young man, he learns some valuable skills (maybe college). He works many years making decent money. Stays debt-free. Saves for a rainy day. Rainy day coes, gets laid off. Lives off his savings and works several crap jobs until he finds another well-paying job.

I love everything about this movie.  I was laid off from my good paying job and had to take a much lower paying job a few months before this movie came out.  So I recognize the desperation and the heartbreak of changing a life and lifestyle you thought was the bedrock of your existence.  Tom Hanks plays that convincingly.  I love how Larry loves his job and has such a bright outlook on life and even though he suffered a brief bout of self pity and depression, he rallied and started over.  Starting over is SCARY.  The first time I watched it I thought Julia Roberts was such a downer, and I realized she had her own bedrock cracked (by her career and husband choices) she just needed Larry to come in to her life and show her how to embrace the starting over.  I loved Gugu Mbatha Raw as Talia.  She is a ray of bright energy that you cannot but help loving.  I loved Wilmer Valderama, patience of a saint-like being.  Cedric the Entertainer and Taraji P Hall were excellent if eccentric neighbors, and all the other supporting characters were spot on.  I watched Hanks in The Terminal and Cast Away.  This man can act opposite a turnip (think soccer ball) and make you root for him every time.  I cannot look away from his performances.  Always very nuanced and never flashy or overacted.

4706505,5,B005HWAOHK,"So this movie is low key, and at times subtle. It isn't some type of blockbuster, the action is all related to relationship building between the characters, and there is only a subtle central conflict throughout the film. There is no easy to identify ""bad guys"", there is simply a warm story of people who are living, and trying to improve themselves. It does not pander to or dwell on the fact that someone entering the end of middle age/ beginning of old age is a fish out of water with some of his younger classmates. It includes a cute young chick, and Julia Roberts is nice eye candy. The soundtrack is as laid back and non-confrontational as the film itself. Don't expect tears, thrills, or a wild ride. It is more of a glimpse through a window, kind of like riding the ""EL"" in Chicago and suddenly seeing into someones dining room.

4706518,4,B005HWAOHK,"This movie wasn't particularly well-received by critics and movie-goers, and it is flawed, and no mistake. Julia Roberts' character was designed rather poorly, and a number of the film's leaden moments stem from that. One reviewer, with some exasperation, pointed out the general lack of conflict in the movie. I feel the conflict was there, but the conflict was just a more subtle, everyday kind which most of us have in our lives.
Tom Hanks' brand of screenplay comedy is a bit awkward sometimes and can fall flat. But Tom Hanks is nothing if he is not, first and foremost, an All-American stand-up guy. He is a gentleman. He will do the right thing. He is an Everyman with a strong sense of integrity. I REALLY miss this kind of individual in the American culture, and am naturally drawn to many of his projects, even a ""fair-to-middlin'"" effort such as this one.",1360972800,2,866,4.703947368421052

Roberts was a bit negative and obnoxious, and Hanks was pretty hum drum. If the movie had taken a turn for the better and stayed that way, I could have followed that. But after watching it until the end, it really fell flat. I am all for the average guy, but give him some worthwhile material please.

The sound track is very good too.",1350518400,,384,3.948051948051948
4706546,1,B005HWAOHK,"It is hard for me to understand what the point or purpose of this film is/was supposed to be. Let's start with the title: ""Larry Crowne."" For some reason, the screenwriters (Tom Hanks and Nia Vardalos) seem to think that this name is inherently funny. As the lead character, Hanks points out several times that his name last name is ""Crowne, with an 'e'."" Okay... and... ? Who cares? What about this name qualifies it as the title of the movie? Oh. Okay. It's a movie about a man no one knows or cares about, ""Larry Crowne."" Oh. I get it. Okay, and... then what happens? Nothing. Huh. I see.

Within the first six minutes of the movie, Larry gets downsized from his job at ""U-Mart."" Since we have just met Larry, we do not care. Upon being summoned over the loudspeaker, Larry and his co-worker (Randall Park, one of the many ""minority"" actors sprinkled throughout the movie to give the illusion that white people are not, in fact, running the world) assume that Larry will probably be named ""Employee of the Month"" for the tenth time. Wrong. Because Larry doesn't have a college education, he cannot be promoted to upper management status. (And yet... he was good enough to be ""Employee of the Month"" nine times.) This is explained to him by four joyless ""managers."" You would think that such an invaluable employee would be worth fighting for. Apparently not.

Then we see Larry returning to a fabulous home in the Southern California Valley. How is it possible that Larry, who was a cook in the navy for 20 years (during which time he apparently got married, raised two kids with his wife, and then divorced his wife and bought out her share of the house) was able to get this fabulous house? I say fabulous by middle-class standards. It appeared to be a nice-sized ranch house. I simply couldn't believe how, as a lower-level manager (who seemed more like a regular staff member) at U-Mart, Larry could have possibly covered the mortgage on this house. But, okay, that is the set-up we were given.

Then we meet Larry's neighbors Lamar (Cedric the ""E"") and B'Ella (Taraji P. Henson). For starters, look at the time and effort put into the name ""B'Ella."" Who is going to care or know that an apostrophe is placed after ""B""? I'll let that go for the moment. Lamar and B'Ella apparently have a daily yard sale in which Lamar cleverly bargains with every customer that comes by. Okay. So what? Who cares? In what way did this ""subplot"" have anything to do with anything? But more importantly, when Larry loses his job, he subtly indicates that it must be great for Lamar not to have to worry about money (because Lamar won $500,000 on a ""Wheel-of-Fortune"" type game). What bothered me about this is that Lamar and B'Ella were black. Now, of course, anyone can win that game. But what it said about the black man in this movie is that he won the game, he got the money, he doesn't have to worry about getting a job... but poor old white Larry is gonna have to start collectin' the unemployment checks (which he apparently never does) and start from square one again lookin' for a job (which he does for about one minute before he apparently gives up). Gimme a break!

Then, because U-mart management indicated that if Larry had some sort of college education, he'd be able to get a higher-level job (duh, really? Oh, is that what you find out at age 55 after working for 35 years?), Larry decides to go to community college. Okay, great.

In the first five minutes of going to CC, he meets a hot cute babe named Talia (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), who is a member of a motorbike ""gang,"" who, of course, is not threatening in any possible way. Talia, other than showing up in the two classes Larry ends up taking, apparently has no other life except roaming the streets of sunny SoCal with her bike buds. She takes an instant liking to Larry and, throughout the course of the film, makes it her mission to ""re-invent"" him. Unlike other critics, who believe it would be impossible for such a woman to find someone as ancient as Tom Hanks appealing, I could buy her attraction to him. However, this is another story thread that has no meaning or value whatsoever in the film, except in the minds of the screenwriters. After Larry's encounter with Talia (who, by the way, has renamed herself Talia, because ""that's who I see when I look in the mirror""--and, as such, decides that Larry should be named Lance Corona--oh, how cute and adorable!), Larry goes in to register for classes and immediately meets the school administrator (Dale Dye?), who encourages Larry to take a public speaking class. ""It will change your life"" he says, and the instructor is easy on the eyes--or words to the effect. What is the point?  So, this means that Larry has no plan or idea of what he is going to take? And therefore takes the class because the administrator tells him it will change his life? Right. What a take-charge kind of guy you are, Larry!

Finally we meet Mercedes Tainot (Julia Roberts), the speech instructor. Now, I love Julia and have seen all her movies. I personally enjoyed that she went against type in this film and played a jaded, alcoholic mess. It was fun seeing her choices as this type of person... but ultimately, the audience does not want to see Julia this way. We love her too much as the whipsmart girl/woman who can slay someone with a well-timed one-liner. In this movie, despite her best efforts, it is hard to care about her or her circumstances.

At this point, I suppose, one could say the movie ""begins."" But this is what happens: Larry lets the bank foreclose on his house because he can't pay the mortgage anymore (but has plenty of free time to go biking with Talia and her pals); we meet Mercedes's porn-surfing blogger husband whose only interest in life appears to be women with big breasts, and, after admitting to such, is promptly dumped by Mercedes (or ""Mercy"" or ""Marcy"" as she is referred to in the film); Larry spends endless amounts of time with Talia, who has a hot, steamy, jealous boyfriend (Wilmer Valderrama), who, unless I'm blind, wouldn't mind a roll in the hay with Larry under the right circumstances; endless scenes in Mercedes's classroom, where Larry and the other loser students (including Grace Gummer, Meryl's daughter!) stumble through half-assed attempts to make speeches based on assignments given by an angry, irritated, slightly hungover Mercedes; Mercedes's inexplicable attraction to Larry... and... where was I going with this? Oh. Right. Nowhere. Which is exactly where this movie goes.

I don't get what the point of this entire experience was supposed to be. It seems like Hanks and Vardalos sat down one afternoon, shared a bottle of wine, came up with some sketch ideas that they obviously thought were alternately hysterically funny (endless jokes about the last names of Larry, Mercedes, and a student named ""Steve Dibiasi"") and ""touching"" (a tearful Larry driving away from his beloved neighborhood as B'Ella cries into Lamar's shoulder).

Throughout all of this drivel, I am not given one reason whatsoever to care about a single person in the entire film. And so I don't. Didn't. Can't.

In addition, there were other things about this movie that I found deeply disturbing. First, what is so fascinating about a middle-aged person who goes to CC? Nothing.  Other irritating points: Larry had to be the only person of his age in the class, and the class had to be ""racially balanced,"" giving the filmmakers an opportunity to make sure  the Screen Actors Guild was happy. Okay, they were racially balanced. Did they all have to be so uniformly dull or stupid? Some of them, as we eventually saw, actually had a spark when they gave their little speeches on whatever topic they grabbed out of Mercedes's box (get your minds out of the gutter). That said, why should we have cared about Mercedes? It was her job to teach people; but apparently in this movie, it was her job to find a man to replace the ""loser"" (that's what she called him, and I concur) that she married. As other critics have pointed out, this movie does a disservice to CC teachers and, actually, to the students who attend them. It was, the more I think about it, vulgar and insulting.

Which leads me to my main point: This whole film could have been so much more than it was. Why couldn't it have been about a man, Hanks, really down on his luck, to the point that unless he finished two more classes of college credits, he really would not be able to get his life back on track. In one of those two classes he meets a jaded, ""I hate my life"" professor who has lost her love for what she probably does quite well--teaching people how to speak in public. In this new version of ""Larry Crowne"" (which of course would never have such a ghastly title, and instead would be called something like ""Speechless"" or ""Larry Gets His Life Back""), Larry and Mercedes's paths would intersect in a dramatic way, with each impacting the other's in such a way as their lives are transformed... with the great one-liners and bits of humor these two wonderful actors are capable of delivering. In fact, one can sense that there is a movie buried within this movie, but, honestly, Hanks and Vardalos sat around the pool way too long in the hot SoCal sun and thought this tale of some middle-aged man who loses his low-level lifer job (or so he mistakenly thought!) would be of interest. It could have been, but it fails on every single possible level. (That doesn't mean I don't love Tom and Julia, I do.)

Finally, what in the hell is wrong with Tom Hanks's face? He goes from looking like the Pillsbury Doughboy to a wax statue version of himself to someone who has just had a bad facelift to bad hair/good hair days, to squinty-eyed freak to tired old codger... honestly, I couldn't stand looking at him. And Tom, honey, you know, yeah, you've had a helluva lot of success, and yeah, you are getting on in life, but, honestly, you need to lose weight. I'm sorry, but if I wanted to watch a movie about a middle-aged man who turns his life from ""loserdom"" to ""winnerdom"" I'd much prefer watching someone who actually respects himself enough to get back into shape. Honestly, don't you think that would have been part of Larry's ""transformation""? Even Julia has a moment on an exercise bike (encouraged by Pam Grier [of all people! Didn't even know it was her!] her gal pal-colleague-someone in the movie who I had know idea what they were doing in it--and, oh, girl, please! Do not wear screaming orange sweatshirts tied around your waist!).

All in all, an absolute, unmitigated disaster, concluding with an unbelievable moment during the end credits where Tom and Julia, who are riding on a motorcycle--without helmets (indicating, what? They're invulnerable? They're ""free""? They're ""celebrities""?)--actually wave to the audience! WTF?

The best thing about this mess, other than the one minute where Julia flashes her mega-watt smile near the end, is the closing credits song, ""Calling America"" by ELO. Tom, good choice! (At last!)",1349654400,12,11042,4.668894601542417

The truth is that the film certainly isn't the same type of movie as many others that either Hanks or Roberts has starred in. However, it does take somewhat of an interesting turn off the beaten path for both actors as well as George Takei (Mr. Sulu of Star Trek fame) who proves in this film that he can still play a serious roll when confronted with the opportunity. The actors in this movie portray what I see as more realistic everyday people more like ourselves. Julia Roberts portrays a common middle-aged college teacher fresh off a crappy marriage... I repeat... 'COMMON'. She's not a famous star reporter or the subject of a hooker's dream... a rich guy sweeps her off her feet. Tom Hanks portrays a middle-age man who has lost his job, and eventually his home, and needs to go back to school in an attempt to improve his future. Again, just a fairly common guy... served a hitch in the Navy and has a knack for cooking... not some lone survivor stranded on a uninhabited island or a guy that falls in love with a mermaid.

4706556,3,B005HWAOHK,"The indifference I feel having watched LARRY CROWNE is voluminous; this is a cute, light, dramedy about a mid-life good guy reinventing himself, and a bored and tired community college professor discovering love is no longer an emotion in the past tense.  And that's it, folks; there is nothing substantive in the slightest, the film has its share of interesting, even compelling, moments, but other than that, it's like taking a gulp of air.  With LARRY CROWNE, there's not much 'there' there.

Our good guy Larry (Tom Hanks) is a Navy vet who has just been laid off stocking shelves and herding shopping carts at the local grocery giant; he was sacked because he didn't have a college degree, meaning no company advancement (to what?  the cash register?).  A divorcee with an underwater mortgage, Larry decides to downsize and get that college degree; he enrolls in a speech class, taught by a decidedly indifferent Mercedes (Julia Roberts), who is in a lifeless marriage with a writer addicted to internet porn (at least Bryan Cranston brings some energy to his role).  Cool college student Talia (a stunning Gugu MBatha-Raw) suddenly takes Larry under her wing, changing his clothes, his hair style, his flat--she even gets him into a scooter gang, all of it begging one burning question:  Why?  Meanwhile Larry discovers he harbors more than platonic feelings for his speech teacher, who responds with a bored yawn, and only shows interest after dumping her husband.  (So in essence, LARRY CROWNE is a story about love on the rebound.)  Various other subplots and storylines are thrown in (but not worth mentioning), culminating in a surreal get-together at Larry's flat (where did all of Mercedes' intense passion come from?), and Larry and Mercedes ride their scooter into romantic bliss.  All in all, there are some moments worth watching, yet most of LARRY CROWNE is phoned in and ambivalent and as bland as a scoop of vanilla on a sugarless waffle cone.  I suddenly feel very sleepy.

4706558,2,B005HWAOHK,"Perhaps the most perplexing thing about Larry Crowne is that it was made in the first place. My guess is this was the bone the studio threw to Hanks in exchange for signing some other deal. The point being, this is a tired format (middle age rediscovery) and it's been done before much better. Off the top of my head, I can think of Sideways and there are doubtless many more.

The problems have to do with the lack of reality - as others have pointed out. There are financial holes in logic, e.g., the house Crowne lives in afforded on a bottom-rung retail gig unless we are to assume he did his time in the U.S. Navy and has a nice retirement. That's feasible, but it then doesn't describe why he feels the need for career insurance. Why not just find another retail job or keep the diner job since he's already got a solid retirement income? Also - why didn't he go to college while in the service?

Continuing with the unanswered but necessary questions, why the acceptance of this middle aged guy into a hip scooter gang? What is it about Larry that makes him so appealing to everyone? Why didn't his marriage work? Where are the kids he envisioned having? What's his back story? There are simply too many questions without answer and plot contrivances to make me suspend disbelief and thus buy into the movie, not the least being Julie Roberts' weak and clichd bad marriage that conveniently ends just in time for Hanks to show up and rescue her.

This is the kind of movie that wants to make you happy but skimps on a script and goes straight for star appeal and conventionality. I understand every movie doesn't have to be gritty and realistic, but this is pure fluff without any heart at all. Having Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts go through the motions as, well, Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts characters, isn't enough to carry a movie. I'm usually a sucker for a decent rom-com or character study, but lacking in fully developed characters, Larry Crowne is neither. Maybe these types of movies should come with a label that says ""This is what we allowed Tom Hanks to do in order to close a bigger deal. Sorry, The Studio.""",1337385600,2,2127,4.4909560723514215
4706559,3,B005HWAOHK,"On paper ""Larry Crowne"" looks very interesting. The comedy drama features two Oscar-winning players Tom Hanks (who also directs) and Julia Roberts. Tom Hanks plays a navy veteran Larry Crowne, likable and hard-working, but recently fired from his job at a megastore. Julia Roberts is disillusioned Mercedes Tainot teaching a speech class at a community college, where Larry enters thinking that getting a class there might help him get a new job.

The interesting premise is wasted on a weak storytelling and script written by Hanks and Nia Vardalos of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" fame. Though outgoing Tom Hanks and cynical Julia Roberts share genuine chemistry, the film fails to provide them with a real story. No background for each character (except Mercedes's marriage that is falling apart), no character development, no plot. Things go too well. The film wants to show that Mercedes is essentially a good teacher, and Crowne a good student. I just don't see in what way they are good.

In his economics class Larry meets Talia (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a free-spirited girl riding a scooter. Young Talia gives fifty-something Larry some advice on hairstyle, clothes and interior decorating, and helps him ""transform."" I am not sure if Larry really needs this transformation, but watching Tom Hanks and Gugu Mbatha-Raw is certainly fun. Only that their episodes, together with the ""scooter gang,"" should belong to another film.

We
begin the piece with him being dumped by a company,representing large corporate interests and these large corporate interests are often mis served by all kinds of bad influences as we see here where hostile local management take on god like personas and mismanage but here we have larry a nice guy tossed out who is model like in many ways and unemployed and he ends up bankrupt like and shows up in julia's class,an english class showing the virtues of those towering practitioners of english shakespeare and shaw(pgymalion/DOCTOR""S DILEMMA) there plays are really about corrupting influences on the mind...however they are known for their elevation of the english language.

4706562,1,B005HWAOHK,"Larry Crowne HAS to be the worst movie I've seen this year, and I've watched plenty so far.  At least 50 movies.  It lacks everything.  There's nothing at *all* appealing about anything taking place.  It's hard to fathom the reason why it even exists.

It's about Tom Hanks' character going back to college after getting fired from his job despite his persistent claims that serving in the Navy should provide security for his position.  From there, well, we meet his neighbor (Cedric the Entertainer's character) and what he does is bargain with people concerning the things he's selling.  The entire communication and bargaining techniques taking place between Cedric and Tom Hanks was tortorous to watch because of how utterly pointless it is.  To make matters worse, Cedric *continues* with the same gimmick for a few more segments later on.

When Tom finally goes back to college, we meet Julia Roberts' character which is that of a teacher- a job she apparently despises.  On the first day of school she actually counts how many students are in the classroom and when she discovers there's only 9 students present, she threatens to walk out but... in comes Tom Hanks ready and eager to learn.  This particular segment is an example of comedy recycled from much older films (mainly ones from the 80's) and used again here with less interesting results.  WAY less interesting.  It doesn't work in todays world.

Now tell me, because I *really* want to know... how in the WORLD is this supposed to be a comedy?  How in the WORLD is it supposed to be a romance?  Because the film does neither one of these things.  Alright, so Tom and Julia fall in love but there's never any excitement leading into the kissing and holding- it more or less just happens.  There's never any believable reason why it's happening either.  The entire plot... well let's not kid ourselves, there is *no* plot to speak of whatsoever.

Tom Hanks simply goes to college, hangs around typical college kids, learns to make speeches that are supposedly enticing to Julia's character and... and oh, let me mention another important aspect.  This HAS to be the most boring college in existence.  The kids are unentertaining, the classes are dull and empty, everyone and everything is flat out boring.  The college professor is the only enticing aspect of the movie, and he's only funny because of how hard he tries to be clever and just ends up not making a bit of sense to any of his students.  Obviously that failed ""smart"" phone joke was a major low point.  The speeches themselves -both from Tom Hanks and his students (especially the crappy Star Wars/Deep Space 9 one) was horrible beyond description.

Only the joke involving Julia Roberts' husband mentioning female breasts and Julia knocking him for his porn collecting habit made me laugh, and that's only because of how Julia reacted to it.  The diner segment at the end and the conversation Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts were having was horrendous because, without spoiling what happens, Julia completely lacked emotion here.  Her lines seemed very forced, uncaring and unnatural.  Otherwise, this is a complete waste of time.  The humor is clearly way WAY off.  The writers forgot to include humor in addition to a watchable storyline (or any storyline at all for that matter).  Simply a disaster of a movie.

4706567,4,B005HWAOHK,"Micro review: Tom Hanks = feel good movie. Plenty of mild humor, touching storyline, an everyman hero everyone wants to cheer on.

Longer review...Tom Hanks is Larry Crowne.  Larry loves his job and excels at it. He's divorced, ex-military and comfortably settled into being alone but not lonely. Then, just when he thought he could live his life out in complacent bliss, he's called to a meeting with his boss. Thinking he's a shoe-in for his ninth round of employee of the month he is devastated to learn that not only is he not, he's out of a job.

The solution to avoiding this same fate elsewhere is college...so he enrolls. There he meets a gang of scooter and motorcycle riding young adults who change his look and his life. And he encounters his speech teacher, Mercy (Julia Roberts). Mercy does not love her job and she does not love her life. She is married to a selfish man and embittered by students who don't care.

There are moments of cheesiness in this film. Mercy lets out a tirade with an F-Bomb or two, and her husband is into buxom women and a few of bikini clad chest shots show up on his computer screen, other than that, the film is refreshingly clean. Larry Crowne's game-show-retiree, perpetual-garage-sale holding neighbors are possibly the best part of the movie.

4706583,5,B005HWAOHK,"Personally I usually don't like very much that kind of light movie, but that one is really underrated, I even believe that ""Larry Crowne"" could be compared to classics like ""Pretty Woman"" or ""Sleepless in Seattle"". One of the main real problems is that the theme of the movie is basically boring, a guy losing his work and trying to find a new one, however everything possible have been done to ""push up"" that idea, from the excellent actors to the quality of the writing who is really excellent. The acting of everybody is really really brilliant, seeing that is an eye candy... In my opinion technically it could be seen as one of the best directorial debut someone could have, but there's some flaws here and there... For one thing there's the title, it's sad to say but it's not a very popular name who inspire confidence or encourage peoples to go see the movie, I even believe many peoples didn't like it just because of that... Something like ""A Year In The Life Of Mr. Crowne"" would have sold the movie better... And there's the song ""Hold On Tight"" by Electric Light Orchestra who is played at the very beginning, it's a very entertaining song but not subtle at all (in my opinion one of the stupidest song of the 80s)... Also on the technical side the quality of the picture is really really horrible, cinematographer Philippe Rousselot usually does a really incredible work, I don't know what happened this time...  Overall I really recommend seeing it even if only because it's a Tom Hanks movie, personally I've seen it two time at the theater and I've been much entertained each time, I prefered that one to mediocrities he did like ""The Da Vinci Code""...",1330905600,5,1669,4.619528619528619

Mbatha-Raw is a revelation, and it doesn't hurt that she has a face which the camera loves.

A predictable movie, innocuous and light, with some initial tedium.  But once the supporting cast appears, the film becomes eminently watchable.  Also worthy of mention are Cedric the Entertainer as Hanks's next-door neighbor and Wilmer Valderrama as Del, Talia's vigilant boyfriend who always seems to be catching Larry and Talia in compromising positions.

4706593,5,B005HWAOHK,"Tom Hanks sure had his hands in the making of this one. Let's see: writer, director, and star. That's a lot of roles, but he fills them all well in this movie.

A feel good romantic comedy that reflects the current economic times we are facing. Poor Larry is downsized from his job, divorced, and has a bleak outlook for prospective jobs. He decides the best option is to enroll in a local college and complete a few courses. He begins simplifying his life, trading in fancy items like an SUV for a scooter to save on gas money. He makes several transitions from employed individual to college student but retains and utilizes his job skills along the way.

Larry is guided towards speech and economics. As it turns out, his speech teacher is a fox (Julia Roberts) who has lost her knack for teaching. The economics professor was perhaps the biggest surprise, played by George Takei. They even give him a little nod when doing speeches as one of the students discusses Star Trek. Julia Robers makes the mistake of saying Star Wars which sends the speaker into a frenzy. Great stuff!

Overall, great family movie that is well worth watching. You can't help but feel for Larry as he makes his way through whatever life has to throw at him.",1328486400,2,1237,4.563063063063063

He enrolls in a community college, makes friends with a lot of young students, and is lucky enough to have a speech teacher played by Julia Roberts.

Co-written and directed by Hanks, this movie falls flat.  It's good-natured and wholesome enough, but so innocuous and predictable that I fell asleep twice and rewatching it didn't help.  From the moment Larry meets his stunningly beautiful teacher (who just happens to want out of a very bad marriage), you know everything is going to turn out happily, but the movie is so slow-moving, it seems to take forever to get to the end.  Hanks comes across as an ideal man who likes and is liked by everybody; he plays his character effortlessly and is very good.  Roberts plays against type as an unpleasant alcoholic, but you know she's going to be transformed by Larry's sweet Everyman persona.  The young students who `help' Larry adjust to college life are pushy and annoying and I never believed that he would befriend them.

4706613,2,B005HWAOHK,"Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks are together co-starring again for, as far as I know, the second time in their careers. The first, again as far as I know, being Charlie Wilson's War. That film, while wildly inaccurate history apparently, was hilarious and greatly underappreciated. But to back to Larry Crowne.

  Larry Crowne (Tom Hanks), with an E as we hear several times, is content in a job as a low-level employee at a generic superstore. Not only is he content, but overjoyed when he is summoned to a meeting with management for what he believes is the announcement of his being named employee of the month for the ninth consecutive time. He is then crushed to find out that he is in fact being fired in an effort to make the job available for someone with the potential for advancement. A potential he doesn't have because he never went to college. Enter Julia Roberts.

  Mercedes Tainot (Roberts) is a professor at a local community college teaching courses on, among other things, public speaking. She is jaded, indifferent, and usually under the influence to varying degrees. Her husband is a twice-published novelist who now whiles away his days blogging and posting on message boards while surfing for porn on the internet and while Mercedes knows this, she is beyond caring.

  I'll admit that Hanks at his worst is better than many at their best. Johnny Knoxville and Larry the Cable Guy just to name two. But regardless of whatever this film could've been, its writer Nia Vardolos has conceived closer to My Big Fat Geek Life than to the refreshing comedy that spawned the ill-fated TV series. And the conclusion, while visible very early in the film, isn't really thought-out. It simply happens. It's fluff that, without the leads, would've gone completely unnoticed and rightly so.",1326499200,2,1796,4.8431372549019605

Julia Roberts was great too, as the disgruntled and embittered professor, who's also stuck in a rut of her own. I would never picture these two A-listers as a couple, but that's how real life is. Sometimes people who are different just work.  No fairy tale here; just good comedy.  Good casting, good plot, good movie.

There is no aspiration for greatness or to better oneself or mankind. There is no uplifting message. If the book is like the movie, then I recommend passing.

There were things that didn't work. I agree the chemistry between the stars is never apparent. Co-stars often upstage the stars (and I wonder why that is such a bad thing anyway. Co-stars can make or break a movie.) But I laughed out loud at several points which is not something I always do unless something is genuinely funny. And I did really care about Hanks' title character (less so for Roberts who mails in her performance). It's simply a sweet, upbeat story where the guy gets the girl in the end and smiles all around.

4706620,4,B005HWAOHK,"Okay, I heard/read of the critical reviews and still I decided to see this movie. I wasn't disappointed. Now I admit to being biased as I really like Tom Hanks as an actor (and he can direct as well) -this movie is more proof of that.

Hanks, as always, gives a great performance, Cedric the Entertainer, is as always, funny, the addition of Gugu Mbatha-Raw was a refreshing surprise: a not-so-well known actress as opposed to the usual parade of ""standard-issue"" Hollywood actresses, did a superb job. Bringing me to my next point: Julia Roberts. I really don't like her all that much and she is well... overrated? But, she did a great job playing her character though I think the focus was on her a bit more than I liked, just my opinion.

The movie did have an air of over-optimism to it as I don't feel it was as realistic as could have been, everything was handled to cleanly, since as we all know real-life tends to get sticky -but again for pure entertainment purposes it had the right doses of reality and Hollywood ""reality"". Speaking of which: there was (in my mind) a small notion that having a scooter and no car was ""the way to go"". I've never seen a scooter ""gang"" (I live in Las Vegas) so I'm a bit suspicious of the ""agenda"" behind this train of thought. I can't imagine Hanks, Roberts or any other big Hollywood types using scooters as their main source of transportation -again my observation.

Overall, this movie deserved more of a liking from critics, if you do like the ""light-romance""/comedy, start-over type of movies where everyone wins in the end, this is your flick. Good movie, good acting and cute story.",1325462400,3,1633,4.566552901023891
4706621,3,B005HWAOHK,"This film never quite takes off, and even having Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks as stars can't save it. In fact, they really don't have much chemistry in this film, and it's not a great performance for either of them. They both fall into 'mugginess' at times, as in mugging for the camera, where they seem to overact, especially with facial expressions. And since in the end this is supposed to be about a slow-growing romance between the two of them, the fact that they don't have a ton of chemistry is a big problem.

As for the plot, basically Larry Crowne (Hanks) has lost his managerial job at U-Mart because he doesn't have a college education, so he decides to downsize his life and go back to school. Julia Roberts plays a speech and communications professor at the local community college that he attends. Other characters in the movie include Roberts' no-good husband, and other students at the school, who befriend Hanks' character and give him a makeover of sorts.

Roberts' character is pretty unlikeable, and so I didn't find myself rooting for them to get together, which is usually the point of a romantic comedy. The film is also pretty slow-paced - it is more of a meandering 'slice of life' kind of film, not an outright comedy (romantic or otherwise) with laugh-out-loud scenes. There are some fun characters that provide more laughs than Hanks and Roberts - a neighbor of Hank's, some friends in his class, an Economics professor, and a bank loan officer (played by Rita Wilson, Hank's wife in real life) - but overall, this isn't enough to save it from so-so status.",1325289600,3,1585,4.697841726618705

Tom Hanks once again plays what appears to be a real guy. Not the brightest light on the tree. Not cool. Not rich. Just real. Thank God for real.

What might have made this movie slightly better would have been to have someone not so absolutely gorgeous as Julia Roberts as the female lead. But she redeems herself mightily by playing a woman whose hopes and dreams have faded into the everyday reality of teaching at a Community College and marrying a man who prefers blogging and online porn more than honest labor and emotional intimacy. In other words; the opposite of Mr. Hanks' character.

Many couples today will feel a little awkward at some of the back and forth between Ms. Roberts' and her on-screen husband, played by Bryan Cranston. But the unadulterated joy of seeing Mr. Hanks' character grow and change and interact with the other characters is a healing balm.

More real than most movies from Hollywood, though still contrived. But at least it's contrived to bring a smile to our faces and give us middle-aged men (and women) a little hope when life feels like something that should have happened by now, but never did.",1324944000,2,1405,4.653225806451613

Even though Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts are two of my favorite actors, a good or great movie needs a good story and good writing.

The summary of the movie seemed like a good plot but the actual movie never materialized on this potential theme.

And so it comes as a complete shock when he's summoned by the management who tell him that they're letting him go because he doesn't have a college degree. Which is disastrous news for Larry as his house is underwater mortgage-wise and finding a new job is proving nigh impossible. Encouraged by his next-door neighbor Lamar (Cedric the Entertainer), who's been running a perpetual yard-sale on his front lawn for the last ten years, Larry decides to go to the local college and get a degree that will, in Lamar's words ""make you fire-proof!"" One of the courses he ends up taking is a public-speaking course taught by Mercedes Tainot (Julia Roberts), a teacher who's suffering from burn-out in her job and disenchantment with her marriage. Predictably, and yet without succumbing to easy cliche, a cautious spark of romance begins to kindle between them as each begins to move beyond their set-backs and disappointments and towards re-starting their lives.

There are a number of key scenes where the film really strikes a resonating chord with what a lot of people have either been through or going through in recent years. The early scene where Larry is being fired is priceless where the managers use convoluted corporate-speak language to make it sound like they're doing Larry a favor by firing him. Another scene is where Larry is at the bank trying to talk to them about his underwater mortgage and the same thing happens as they talk him into doing whatever he can to continue making payments even though there's no way he can sell the house or keep up with the payments, again using contorted bank-speak to make it sound like they're acting in his interests and not their own.

The supporting cast is excellent and really helps keep things interesting with stand-out performances by Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Talia, a hurricane-on-wheels of irrepressible perkiness who takes charge of giving Larry a new look as well as a new set of friends, and manages to do a feng-shui makeover of his house in the process; Wilmer Valderamma as Del, Talia's frequently glowering and much put-upon boyfriend; Malcolm Barrett as Dave Mack, a student in the public speaking class who, against type, turns out to be a major Trekkie; and George Takei has a delightfully dry comic turn as the serenely self-important Dr. Matsutani who teaches Larry's Economics 101 class. And Cedric the Entertainer does another grand scene-stealing turn as Lamar, who lives to haggle with people at his never-ending yard sale.

And in the why-is-that-face-or-voice-familiar? category: Grace Gummer who plays Natalie, one of Larry's fellow students, is in real-life the daughter of Meryl Streep, to whom she bears a striking resemblance; Rita Wilson, who plays the let-me-not-help-you bank rep Wilma Gammelgaard, is Tom Hanks' wife in real life; and Nia Vardalos supplies the voice of the annoying Map Genie GPS system in Mercedes' car.

On the somewhat minus side however, Bryan Cranston, who was brilliant in TV's Malcolm in the Middle and Breaking Bad, doesn't seem to quite hit the mark as Mercedes' shiftless porn-addicted husband, Dean. And Pam Grier is largely wasted in her role as Frances, Mercedes' friend and fellow teacher.

The one real drawback to Larry Crowne is that it never digs very deep, particularly on the emotional level, in spite of all the stressful life-changing events Larry and Mercedes are facing. Hanks' Larry, for example, _never_ gets angry, in spite of his being fired for inane reasons, having to face losing his house, etc. Neither does Roberts' Mercedes, no matter how much her husband lets her down or insults her. Annoyed or peeved is about as far as they go. Hanks and Vardalos, as director and writers, could have gone for more, given the things Larry and Mercedes must deal with in their personal lives, but they just keep things fairly light. Which is not bad exactly, as the film is enjoyable. But in the end, you're left with the feeling that they could have gone for more.

Again, while Larry Crowne is not a terribly deep film, it does connect in a lot of ways, and I think a lot of people will relate to it. Recommended for anyone who wants to find something whimsically upbeat and hopeful about dealing with the things life can throw at you these days.",1324080000,7,5146,4.801354401805869

Here, the titular character is a recently downsized retail employee who decides to enroll in community college, where he meets various new friends and falls in love with his Public Speaking instructor. Unfortunately, while the film's two stars are certainly likeable and are able to maintain a relaxed chemistry, I found the story all too conventional and bland, earning Larry Crowne a mere one star.

Tom Hanks does a great job as ""Lance"" and Julia Roberts and he have real chemistry on screen. This movie has no explosions, no fast cars, no half-naked women.

4706661,2,B005HWAOHK,"First off, the premise for the film is interesting and timely. Many people need college degrees to succeed in the work place or to even hold an entry level position. Larry needs schooling to get his life on track. He is unemployed and down on his luck. This is the most realistic part of the movie. Hanks is likable as Larry and Julia Roberts 'gets' the burned out community college teacher role to perfection.

My problem with the film is that as a college professor, I am sick and tired of seeing these ""teachers fall for student"" movies. Sure, Larry is an older non-traditional student. In reality, this does not matter. A teacher who is romantic with a student could be fired or could face serious consequences in terms of professionalism. (I have had several male colleagues over the years become romantic with young female students and...real life or not..all of them are out of a job once their antics became well known). We are like doctors, psychologists, or any other highly educated field and a code of trust is in place. We never break that, and the folks who do are usually not good teachers.

I would have liked this film more if Roberts inspired Hanks and left it there without the kissing or later relationship. Because THAT would be real. Also, the fact that Hanks makes friends easily (they try to make him 'cool' and invite him into their scooter gang) is also very unrealistic. Most college kids are foul mouthed, unmotivated, hate adults, and booze it up.

On one hand, the fantasy element of this movie is off the charts. That can be refreshing in a depressing world...but also dangerous when people (esp kids) view this and think, ""this is how college is."" It isn't.",1322870400,2,1689,4.6610738255033555

Oh yeah, I remember, ""Everything Must Go"" and I believe there was a $.99 VHS on the table entitled ""Larry Crowne"". While no longer surprised at how certain storylines are continuously recycled, it is also no longer surprising that unimaginative writing, directing and acting has a zombie like persistence. Anyway, mostly far fetched student, teacher behaviors that didn't have any chance of being or even seeming real - just over scripted. It seems like rom-coms are like taxes - endless cookie cutter, churn 'em out, spit 'em out process.

It is tragic that people nowadays are so mentally simplified that any deviation from an expected scenario is perceived as ""not good"". Tom Hanks did try to simplify the tragic parts, but unless you pay attention, you miss the subtle acting that really expresses perfectly the required mood. But if you are stuffing your face with hotdogs, popcorn and soft drinks, you will miss important tidbits of the narrative.

Steel Magnolias
Pretty Woman
Flatliners
Sleeping With The Enemy
Dying Young
My Best Friend's Wedding

It's as if she fell into the Brad Pitt/George Clooney (and now Tom Hanks) crowd, and stopped caring if her roles cause her to stretch her acting abilities.

Talia takes Larry under her wing, dresses him like a college student and spiffs up his home while attending the same classes as Larry - Econ (with the weasley Dr Matsutani played to the hilt by George Takei), and Speech taught by Mercedes (Mercy) Tainot (Julia Roberts) who is usually hungover, drinks too much in order to tolerate her useless husband (Bryan Cranston), and tries every trick to get out of teaching her disinterested students. Larry's developing new self (he has a job as a short order cook in a diner now) meets the change factor in his life - Mercy - who because of his kindness and gentlemanly ways attracts Mercy. That of course progresses into predictable situations.

The other aspect of the film that is actually the most touching is the relationship between Larry and his neighbors Lamar (Cedric the Entertainer) and Bella (Taraji P. Henson) who are in a constant state of yard sale: these two actors provides some of the finest scenes in the film.  Larry Crowne joins Talia and Dell Gordo in a motor scooter gang, changes his appearance and outlook, and with the help of his new relationship with Mercy he manages to come up happy.  In the end the film (despite some good cameo roles) pretty much wastes Hanks and Roberts in an out of focus antidote to the current state of mass unemployment.  LARRY CROWNE tries hard but the bumbling big bird of an airplane just never makes it off the ground. Grady Harp, November 11",1321488000,,2878,4.692460317460317

Larry Crowne is a hard working American that is faced with being downsized from his company. He is then faced to go to college for the first then ever.

But, before Larry goes to college, he attempts to get a job. Larry calls other places for job openings, but to no luck. He then decides to go door to door to places and apply for work. As you may have guessed, Larry is pretty old and old fashion. I thought this part is pretty funny to watch because hardly anyone ever goes door to door applying to places anymore.  Now a days, email is the only choice and I won't be surprised if places tell people to apply online. Also, most places won't even give out their phone number to call them.  But, I understand why the movie showed Larry do those things. If we just saw Larry siting at his computer typing a cover that would be pretty boring to watch. Or, him sitting there thinking about what to write is the same thing...boring. So, making him drive around and going door to door makes a better movie. With no luck getting a job, Larry now goes to college.

Making Larry drive around also goes into another point in the movie. Larry drives a huge gas guzzler and gas is so expansive! So, that makes Larry buy a scooter. The scooter actually helps Larry more than get around. He meets a sweet young girl named Tania and she is a student. Tania invite Larry into her bike gang or scooter gang.

In school, Larry has a few classes. He has a Economic class and a communication class. The econ class teaches Larry how to be better with money and his finances. That helps him find a way to get out of his in debt house, which he thought he couldn't get out of. Larry has a communication class that supposed to teach him to communicate better. After a while, he slowly starts to fall in love with his teacher, Mercy"" Tainot, (Julia Roberts). However, Julia play a teacher that has loss her love in teaching and is married to a dead beat husband. She too starts to fall in love with Larry after she dumps her husband.  But, they can't really embrace their love for each other because she is a the teacher and he is her student.

Only after Larry passes Tainot class, they can finally be together. This is the happy ending that the audience loves to see happen at the end. If it went any other way, then I would had hated this movie. There were a few things that I didn't write about that was also important in the movie, but I would rather have you see it then me write about it and spolier it for you. I do recommend this movie.

The movie proudly wears its heart on its sleeve, and the commitment that Hanks shows in his character's plight goes a long way to compensate for the episodic, by-the-numbers screenplay co-written by Hanks and Nia Vardalos (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Big-Fat-Greek-Wedding/dp/B00006FMUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Big Fat Greek Wedding</a>). The screenplay is what makes the film a bit disheartening to watch since its amiable nature and can-do sensibilities don't produce much in the way of compelling conflict. The concept appears timely, but the treatment feels like a Hollywood studio-manufactured version of what happens when sudden unemployment and economic hardship alter your reality.

The title character is a divorced man in his mid-fifties who is the ideal employee in a Walmart-type store after spending nearly twenty years as a cook in the Navy. Thinking he was about to win another employee of the month award, Larry finds out that he is the victim of a downsizing ostensibly due to his lack of a college degree and consequently being told he has reached his maximum growth potential with the store. In order to ensure that he never has this problem again, Larry enrolls in a local community college where he is advised to take an introductory economics course and a class on public speaking where he meets a lovely but disillusioned professor named Mercedes Tainot, herself dealing with a bad marriage and a drinking problem. Larry also acquires a scooter and attracts the strictly platonic attention of a fellow student named Tania, a free spirit who is a member of a harmlessly hip scooter gang and makes him over to look more fashion forward.

Little time is spent on Larry's actual economic situation, and Hanks uses the convenient device of a pretentious loan officer (played comically by his wife, Rita Wilson) to explain what Larry has to do to curtail his sinking mortgage payments. Along the way, he finds a job as a line cook at a diner, makes new friends, and learns to loosen up a little and enjoy the small things in life. At first, Hanks as an actor appears to be in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forrest-Gump/dp/B00003CXA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forrest Gump</a>&nbsp;mode as Larry, avuncular and docile to the point of appearing mentally challenged, but then he gravitates toward his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-ve-Got-Mail/dp/B000YDBPAM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You've Got Mail</a>&nbsp;character when he sets out to win Roberts' heart.

Gugu Mbatha-Raw is appealing as Tania, but her character is probably the most unbelievable in the story. As Larry's constantly huckstering neighbor, Cedric the Entertainer is used primarily for comic relief, while Taraji P. Henson has a barely-there role as his perky wife. So does Pam Grier who provides her earthy presence all far too briefly as Mercedes' fellow faculty member. Bryan Cranston has the predictable role of Mercedes' porn-surfing, no-account husband and plays him exactly to formula. George Takei steals several scenes as the self-absorbed economics professor, while Wilmer Valderrama appears to be upending his role as Fez on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/That-70s-Show/dp/B0002PYS5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">That '70s Show</a>&nbsp;as Tania's innocuously jealous boyfriend. By the way, it's hard to miss Grace Gummer as one of the students since she is a carbon copy of her mother Meryl Streep's younger self.

4706696,3,B005HWAOHK,"I'll try to not dump on LARRY CROWNE too much because Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts have built up so much cachet with me. I'm giving the film 3.5 out of 5 stars because even though the film comes off low key and presents a series of weak spots, these two iconic actors still manage to shine like the stars they are... only, here, the wattage is set to dimmer than normal. Is it wrong to expect more out of these two? I wasn't anticipating walking out of the film feeling that it was only okay.

In a time of rampant downsizing, Larry Crowne never saw it coming. A veteran employee of the U-Mart supermarket, Larry is one of them happy, conscientious, efficient workers, having made Employee of the Month eight times. Except that Larry doesn't have a college degree, has never even gone to college, is expendable. The suits bluntly inform him that, without a college degree, Larry has no shot at upward mobility in U-Mart, and therefore there is no use in keeping him on. This is how Larry Crowne gets sacked.

Tom Hanks ably exhibits the panic and dismay one experiences when you lose a job that you'd felt was so secure. And you emphatize with him more during this down moment, much more so than when he was merrily straightening out bits of sales items in the workplace or helpfully providing customer service. We get that sequence in which Larry Crowne applies for and gets rejected at various retail positions, and it's confirmed (in case you were wondering) that, yes, the job market really does suck right now. A depressed Larry gets advice from his perenially yard sale having neighbor (Cedric the Entertainer): ""Get you some knowledge and you'll be fire-proof."" And Larry hearkens. He hies himself to the East Valley Community College and enrolls in several self-improvement classes. Namely, Economics 1 (or ""Econ Prime"") and Speech 217 a.k.a. the Art of Informal Remarks.

Here's Julia Roberts, looking a bit shopworn but that's a bit of character acting, I'm sure. She plays Mercedes ""Mercy"" Tainot, the prickly, disillusioned speech communications teacher, and it's made quickly apparent that she's one of them brittle wounded doves. Her husband is a tool who spends his time accessing them naughty web sites on the 'net, and there's a coolness between the couple. And maybe some of what's offputting about the film has to do with Julia going to that bitter well too often. There's a part of me that rails at Julia Roberts not being exuberant and lovable like in her other pictures. It's funny. We want our actors to branch out, to step out of their comfort zones. And yet when they do, sometimes, we blink. I'm just not used to seeing a Julia Roberts character that's this resentful.

Gugu Mbatha-Raw, so lovely and whom I thought was very good as Sam Bloom in UNDERCOVERS, is like a breath of fresh air and she injects so much breezy energy into the story. She's Talia, a young free spirit who befriends Larry Crowne and gradually makes him over, nurtures his self-confidence, gives him a new name: ""Lance Corona."" Talia introduces him to her troop of scooter-riding enthusiasts, and I never thought there'd be room in cinema for scooter gangs as a sub-culture, but there it is. Talia jauntily tells Larry: ""A man on a scooter can accomplish anything, Lance."" However, I'll debate anyone to the death that there's something inherently cool about a middle-aged dude sporting those chain thingees hanging off his belt. But my point was - Gugu Mbatha-Raw is a breath of fresh air.

If you're expecting an incisive, insightful look at our current recession, then you should double-check the marquee billing because this isn't UP IN THE AIR. What LARRY CROWNE does have is a story about a working schmoe like you and me trying to survive and finding out that going to college comes with its own rewards. And maybe that's what Tom Hanks is going for. No epic swerves, just a guy making do with his little triumphs. And that's not a bad message. There's even a scene here which demonstrates that strategic foreclosure doesn't have to be as embarassing as implied.

The film doesn't give us a reason to invest in Larry's classmates in Speech 217. Rita Wilson's banker isn't enough in the film for her to matter. However, Wilmer Valderrama is enjoyable as the leader of the scooter gang who's juuuust a bit concerned that Larry Crowne is making too much time with his girl, Talia. George Takei has a choice bit as the economics professor who expects his students to laugh along at his jokes (except that they don't). LARRY CROWNE settles for the sweet and simple romantic comedy, except that I don't think the two leads invest enough scenes together, and so the romance comes off a bit abrupt to me. I think Hanks and Roberts were all too aware of their age and so played it safe, and so their thing comes off more like comfy pajamas than sexy negligee, if you get the metaphorical drift. When Tom and Julia finally lock lips, it's more of a slapstick wrestling match than anything. The pace doesn't snap, and it feels like there's something missing. LARRY CROWNE will do for a modest romantic comedy. Although it's great to see Hanks and Roberts plying their craft - and it's great to see them in the same movie and be still so likable (yes, Julia's character warms up) - it seems like it should've been more.

She stars as Mercedes Tainot, a community college teacher in Southern California trapped in a loveless marriage to a writer of epic-sized fantasy novels like A GAME OF THRONES, only not very successful.  Mercedes feels used by her husband, and for some reason feels especially irked when it is revealed that he (Bryan Cranston, not bad in an underwritten part) is exposed as the type of buy who, as soon as Julia Roberts leaves the house, heads for the @sexchannels on his computer.  Like that's supposed to be a terrible crime against humanity.  Meanwhile Tom Hanks (we are not told but I assume he is pornfree) has become a student in Mercedes' public speaking class.  This part of the movie was very intriguing, for all to seldom do the movies show an actual class in operation from beginning to end, well, at any rate you get to learn something here.  I learned a lot about public speaking from Julia Roberts' sensible, no nonsense advice.

She says that when you begin to speak, you should look up and directly confront the face of someone way to the left of you.  A few minutes later, raise your head from your notes once again, and address someone directly in front of you.  Then try swiveling your head to catch the attention of those on your right.  By the time you have done this, advises the Oscar-winning star, you will have made the whole room feel like they've just had a direct conversation with you--you will have gotten through to them.

As in every other movie where the heroine has an unusual or bizarre name, I suspected an anagram right away.  Like the way the name of the heroine in THE TIME TRAVELLER'S WIFE anagrammed out to ""Isabel Archer,"" the heroine of Henry James' novel THE WINGS OF THE DOVE, I sat upon the name ""Mercedes Tainot"" wondering how to puzzle out its secrets.  It must have signified something to Tom Hanks, who wrote the serviceable screenplay as a vanity vehicle for himself.  But what?  I worked out a few anagrams, but do any of them really make sense as a ""Rosebud""-style revelation to the inner meaning of LARRY CROWNE?  There's ""Mister Anecdote,"" which I like, also, ""Comedian Tester,"" which would have been good in some other movie perhaps, not this one however.  Then there's ""Remote Distance,"" but to me that hardly describes the one and only Julia Roberts!

He has been employee of the month 8 times and is a hard worker. Now he is being let go because he has no degree and won't be able to advance. Now in some professions I could see that happening, but for a guy who stocks shelves and pushes shopping carts? He also lives in a half million dollar home which is now worth less than the $392,000 he owes on it. (Where are those Walmart applications!) I understand they needed to get him into the school environment, but they could have written a real scenario and one that was funny and tied into the rest of the movie.

Tom Hanks downsizes his life and goes back to school. His Speech 217 teacher is a slightly unkempt, bored with life, Julia Roberts. She is equally bored in her marriage to a writer who spends most of his time watching porn on the Internet. (I can't believe there is porn on the Internet!) They split over an unlikely fight.

Unfortunately, the basic premise of the film, a man who is forced to redefine himself late in life due to job cutbacks, is *so* timely that the endless cheese-ball attitude nearly kills any sociological resonance. But do know that the film is so harmless, so light on it's feet, so family friendly that you can literally take anyone you know to go see it. Should we expect more edge from Hanks? Sure.

4706705,4,B005HWAOHK,"LARRY CROWNE is a light romantic comedy - with considerable emphasis on ""light"" - starring Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts that continues a genre in which Tom's earlier films with Meg Ryan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleepless-in-Seattle/dp/B00170F0KM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleepless in Seattle</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-ve-Got-Mail/dp/B001N3LLH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You've Got Mail</a>) were hits. Except that LARRY CROWNE isn't as good as those previous two. Perhaps it's the aging of the target audience, or that Roberts doesn't have quite the same chemistry with Hanks as Ryan did, or I'm just getting cantankerous.

Here, Tom plays Larry Crowne, a forty-something employee of U-Mart fired because he hasn't a college education and has reached his ceiling with the company. Everything thus dumps on Larry at once: the needs for more education and a new job and the painful necessity to rid himself of a house on which he owes more than it's worth.

To get the book learning, Crowne enrolls in a local community college. One of his classes teaches off-the-cuff speaking, and is taught by Mercedes Tainot (Roberts). Tainot is suffering both professional and husband burnout. Her spouse Dean (Bryan Cranston) is ostensibly a stay-at-home writer, but he spends his days viewing Internet soft-porn featuring busty babes. The last straw for Mercedes comes when his retort in a nasty verbal spat is that she's flat-chested. In the meantime, Larry, a former Navy commissaryman, i.e. cook, gets a gig as a short-order chef at a coffee shop.

Both Larry and Mercedes each need to kick-start a new life. They're made for each other. Perhaps the best scene involving the two is when Mercedes asks Larry if he wants to kiss her. As it plays out, we realize the depths of their respective needs.

While the movie is amusing, inoffensive and cute - and Roberts remains the eternal ""pretty woman"" - the problem for me was that it was too cute and improbable.

A neighbor of Crowne's, Lamar (Cedric the Entertainer), apparently runs a 24/7 flea market in his front yard. Since it's a nice, middle-class neighborhood, in real life I'd have to believe the local homeowner's association would have a cease and desist order slapped on Lamar faster than he could say, ""For you, only ten bucks.""

Also featured is a scooter gang (as opposed to a motorcycle gang), a member of which (Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Talia) works to bring out the inner Larry. A scooter gang? Really? How adorable is that?

Perhaps the best role is played by George Takei (of TV's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-Original-TV-Series-Blu-ray/dp/B004E10QCI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek: Original TV Series [Blu-ray</a>] as Economics professor Dr. Matsutami. He's weird and a bit creepy in an endearing sort of way; it's a nice spin on what might otherwise have been a ho-hum supporting effort.

Of greater interest to me were the film's shooting locations, a couple of which were recognizable as being very local to my own residence.

The ""U-Mart"" exterior shots were actually of a K-Mart on San Fernando Road in Burbank. Obviously, the signage was changed perhaps because the latter didn't want to be seen as the evil corporation capable of firing educational low achievers and/or giving lovable Tom Hank's in any guise the heave.

The coffee shop that hired Larry was depicted as ""Frank's"", an eatery that really exists also in Burbank on Olive Avenue. In one scene, Mercedes occupies a booth consuming a meal just cooked-up by Crowne. So, the week after I saw the film, I stopped in for lunch. As I was the only customer, I was able to sit in the same booth in the exact spot as Julia Roberts. For a brief, giddy moment, I felt close to greatness and a chill went down my spine. (Well, perhaps it was the air conditioning after coming in out of upper-90s heat.) One of the waitresses, who was working Frank's in 2010 during the filming, was thrilled that she'd had a (very) small appearance in the final cut and that Hanks, who'd also directed, had taken to heart a couple of her suggestions as to how a coffee shop is actually run. You're a star, girl!

The patty melt, by the way, was excellent.

LARRY CROWNE is no more than a mediocre entertainment vehicle deserving three stars if one ignores the presence of the two showbiz titans in the cast. But, with Tom and Julia - both deservedly beloved by American (and international) filmgoers - one must elevate the flick to four stars. I mean, to do otherwise would be to similarly say that anything ordinary that Jimmy Stuart and Audrey Hepburn - I date myself here - might have appeared in together was marginal dross. That just isn't coming from me.",1310515200,,4829,5.216774193548387
4706706,4,B005HWAOHK,"I'll try to not dump on LARRY CROWNE too much because Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts have built up so much cachet with me. I'm giving the film 3.5 out of 5 stars because even though the film comes off low key and presents a series of weak spots, these two iconic actors still manage to shine like the stars they are... only, here, the wattage is set to lower than normal. Is it wrong to expect more out of these two?  I wasn't anticipating walking out of the film feeling that it was only okay.

In a time of rampant downsizing, Larry Crowne never saw it coming. A veteran employee of the U-Mart supermarket, Larry is one of them happy, conscientious, efficient workers, having made Employee of the Month eight times. Except that Larry doesn't have a college degree, has never even gone to college, is expendable. The suits bluntly inform him that, without a college degree, Larry has no shot at upward mobility in U-Mart, and therefore there is no use in keeping him on. This is how Larry Crowne gets sacked.

Tom Hanks ably exhibits the panic and dismay one experiences when you lose a job that you'd felt was so secure. And you emphatize with him more during this down moment, much more so than when he was merrily straightening out bits of sales items in the workplace or helpfully providing customer service. We get that sequence in which Larry Crowne applies for and gets rejected at various retail positions, and it's confirmed (in case you were wondering) that, yes, the job market really does suck right now. A depressed Larry gets advice from his perenially yard sale having neighbor (Cedric the Entertainer): ""Get you some knowledge and you'll be fire-proof."" And Larry hearkens. He hies himself to the East Valley Community College and enrolls in several self-improvement classes. Namely, Economics 1 (or ""Econ Prime"") and Speech 217 a.k.a. the Art of Informal Remarks.

Here's Julia Roberts, looking a bit shopworn but that's a bit of character acting, I'm sure. She plays Mercedes ""Mercy"" Tainot, the prickly, disillusioned speech communications teacher, and it's made quickly apparent that she's one of them brittle wounded doves. Her husband is a tool who spends his time accessing them naughty web sites on the 'net, and there's a coolness between the couple. And maybe some of what's offputting about the film has to do with Julia going to that bitter well too often. There's a part of me that rails at Julia Roberts not being exuberant and lovable like in her other pictures. It's funny. We want our actors to branch out, to step out of their comfort zones. And yet when they do, sometimes, we blink. I'm just not used to seeing a Julia Roberts character that's this resentful.

Gugu Mbatha-Raw, so lovely and whom I thought was very good as Sam Bloom in UNDERCOVERS, is like a breath of fresh air and she injects so much breezy energy into the story. She's Talia, a young free spirit who befriends Larry Crowne and gradually makes him over, nurtures his self-confidence, gives him a new name: ""Lance Corona."" Talia introduces him to her troop of scooter-riding enthusiasts, and I never thought there'd be room in cinema for scooter gangs as a sub-culture, but there it is. Talia jauntily tells Larry: ""A man on a scooter can accomplish anything, Lance."" However, I'll debate anyone to the death that there's something inherently cool about a middle-aged dude sporting those chain thingees hanging off his belt. But my point was - Gugu Mbatha-Raw is a breath of fresh air.

If you're expecting an incisive, insightful look at our current recession, then you should double-check the marquee billing because this isn't UP IN THE AIR. What LARRY CROWNE does have is a story about a working schmoe like you and me trying to survive and finding out that going to college comes with its own rewards. And maybe that's what Tom Hanks is going for. No epic swerves, just a guy making do with his little triumphs. And that's not a bad message. There's even a scene here which demonstrates that strategic foreclosure doesn't have to be as embarassing as implied.

The film doesn't give us a reason to invest in Larry's classmates in Speech 217. Rita Wilson's banker isn't enough in the film for her to matter. However, Wilmer Valderrama is enjoyable as the leader of the scooter gang who's juuuust a bit concerned that Larry Crowne is making too much time with his girl, Talia. George Takei has a choice bit as the economics professor who expects his students to laugh along at his jokes (except that they don't). LARRY CROWNE settles for the sweet and simple romantic comedy, except that I don't think the two leads invest enough scenes together, and so the romance comes off a bit abrupt to me. I think Hanks and Roberts were all too aware of their age and so played it safe, and so their thing comes off more like comfy pajamas than sexy negligee, if you get the metaphorical drift. When Tom and Julia finally lock lips, it's more of a slapstick wrestling match than anything. The pace doesn't snap, and it feels like there's something missing. LARRY CROWNE will do for a modest romantic comedy. Although it's great to see Hanks and Roberts plying their craft - and it's great to see them in the same movie and be still so likable (yes, Julia's character warms up) - it seems like it should've been more. But what do you expect? There's a recession on.",1310428800,,5360,4.689691817215728
4706707,4,B005HWAOHK,"Larry Crowne, directed by Tom Hanks, from a screenplay by Tom Hanks and Nia Vardalos (My Big Fat Greek Wedding) is not a deep movie, which is disappointing because it could have been. But that said, Hanks and Vardalos get a lot of the important stuff right and as a result Larry Crowne hits home in a lot of ways. The issues it touches on - job loss, divorce, worry about losing your house, having to start your life all over again both career-wise and romantically - are things that will connect and resonate with a lot of people these days.

The title character, Larry Crowne (Tom Hanks) is a likeable guy who works hard at his job as a ""team leader"" at the local U-Mart where he's worked every day since doing 20 years in the Navy right out of high school. He enjoys his job, likes his co-workers who like him in return, and has been voted Employee-of-the-Month multiple times. And so it comes as a complete shock when he's summoned by the management who tell him that they're letting him go because he doesn't have a college degree. Which is disastrous news for Larry as his house is underwater mortgage-wise and finding a new job is proving nigh impossible.  Encouraged by his next-door neighbor Lamar (Cedric the Entertainer), who's been running a perpetual yard-sale on his front lawn for the last ten years, Larry decides to go to the local college and get a degree that will, in Lamar's words ""make you fire-proof!""  One of the courses he ends up taking is a public-speaking course taught by Mercedes Tainot (Julia Roberts), a teacher who's suffering from burn-out in her job and disenchantment with her marriage. Predictably, and yet without succumbing to easy cliche, a cautious spark of romance begins to kindle between them as each begins to move beyond their set-backs and disappointments and towards re-starting their lives.

There are a number of key scenes where the film really strikes a resonating chord with what a lot of people have either been through or going through in recent years. The early scene where Larry is being fired is priceless where the managers use convoluted corporate-speak language to make it sound like they're doing Larry a favor by firing him. Another scene is where Larry is at the bank trying to talk to them about his underwater mortgage and the same thing happens as they talk him into doing whatever he can to continue making payments even though there's no way he can sell the house or keep up with the payments, again using contorted bank-speak to make it sound like they're acting in his interests and not their own.

The supporting cast is excellent and really helps keep things interesting with stand-out performances by Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Talia, a hurricane-on-wheels of irrepressible perkiness who takes charge of giving Larry a new look as well as a new set of friends, and manages to do a feng-shui makeover of his house in the process; Wilmer Valderamma as Del, Talia's frequently glowering and much put-upon boyfriend; Malcolm Barrett as Dave Mack, a student in the public speaking class who, against type, turns out to be a major Trekkie; and George Takei has a delightfully dry comic turn as the serenely self-important Dr. Matsutani who teaches Larry's Economics 101 class.  And Cedric the Entertainer does another grand scene-stealing turn as Lamar, who lives to haggle with people at his never-ending yard sale.

And in the why-is-that-face-or-voice-familiar? category: Grace Gummer who plays Natalie, one of Larry's fellow students, is in real-life the daughter of Meryl Streep, to whom she bears a striking resemblance; Rita Wilson, who plays the let-me-not-help-you bank rep Wilma Gammelgaard, is Tom Hanks' wife in real life; and Nia Vardalos supplies the voice of the annoying Map Genie GPS system in Mercedes' car.

On the somewhat minus side however, Bryan Cranston, who was brilliant in TV's Malcolm in the Middle and Breaking Bad, doesn't seem to quite hit the mark as Mercedes' shiftless porn-addicted husband, Dean. And Pam Grier is largely wasted in her role as Frances, Mercedes' friend and fellow teacher.

The one real drawback to Larry Crowne is that it never digs very deep, particularly on the emotional level, in spite of all the stressful life-changing events Larry and Mercedes are facing. Hanks' Larry, for example, _never_ gets angry, in spite of his being fired for inane reasons, having to face losing his house, etc. Neither does Roberts' Mercedes, no matter how much her husband lets her down or insults her. Annoyed or peeved is about as far as they go. Hanks and Vardalos, as director and writers, could have gone for more, given the things Larry and Mercedes must deal with in their personal lives, but they just keep things fairly light. Which is not bad exactly, as the film is enjoyable. But in the end, you're left with the feeling that they could have gone for more.

Again, while Larry Crowne is not a terribly deep film, it  does connect in a lot of ways, and I think a lot of people will relate to it.  Recommended for anyone who wants to find something whimsically upbeat and hopeful about dealing with the things life can throw at you these days.",1310342400,20,5151,4.801354401805869
4706708,4,B005HWAOHK,"I came to the movie theater having no idea what Larry Crowne was all about. All I knew was Tom Hanks did a new movie adn Julia Roberts was in it so from afar it was promising.  I was not dissapointed. The movie really has two primary storylines throughout:  Tom Hanks as Larry Crowne is fired from his job at E-Mart (like Wal-Mart) and goes back to community college to get a degree. Julia Roberts plays his teacher who has her own problems at home with a husband addicted to pronography and a big drinker. Teacher and student form a bond, Larry learns about the basics of economics and public speaking and also becomes a lot more ""cool"" thanks to a friend at school, and a good but not sappy ending follows. Very worthwhile. Tom Hanks is excellent in this role.",1310083200,,762,4.397163120567376
4706709,5,B005HWAOHK,"I'm not a big fan of conflict. If I want conflict, I watch the news. Having lost a job, however, I could empathize with Larry's angst at losing his. Upside down mortgage, paying the bills, constant rejection - conflict enough for me.

This was NOT supposed to be a message movie. Or a life-changing experience. Or a lesson in life. It was a romantic comedy with the best in the business in the leads... who, I might add, still have the screen chemistry to make it believable. I loved Rita Wilson's Wilma Q. Gaammelgaard, and would love to know the story behind the origin of that name. Gugu Mbatha-Raw is a beautiful starlet in the old Hollywood definition of the word. And her character, Talia, was a great way of showing that college is not always necessary...for everyone. (So maybe there was a little life-lesson stuff going on.)

Every actor in the movie did his or her part well. And special notice to Nia Vardalos as the map genie voice. I know nothing about show business except what I read and watch on the back stories of DVD's. But my guess is that this set must have been fun to go to every day. And what a terrific opportunity for young actors to learn from the best. And experienced actors to entertain without a heavy duty, moral wheeling message.

Thank you for the upbeat fun and escape from the evening news - and reminding us that sometimes the nice guy really does finish first, and gets an A+ to go with it!

SEVERAL DAYS LATER:  I just saw an interview with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts. Now I understand why this movie works w/o being sappy. Tom, like most of us, tries to overcome cynicism. That's the element I couldn't put my finger on. I can get depression free from the news and many shows (which I don't watch anyway), so why would I want to pay to be depressed!?
