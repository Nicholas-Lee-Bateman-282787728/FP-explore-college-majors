6708358,5,B00O3QAW50,scariest movie I have seen in a long time.,1412899200,3,42,3.7777777777777777
6708359,5,B00O3QAW50,"To Anyone Involved with this Film - Kudos; job well-done; you should be proud of this film - it was quite entertaining!  Actors were very believable in that although they were documenting their road trip, they were comfortable in their skin, funny, spontaneous and I liked them all.  One little complaint, this is the 2nd FF film that casts the girl in the role of the complainer albeit not obnoxious like the last FF film I watched.  I believed she wanted to leave the road trip after about the 3rd night out (perhaps she should have gone with her instincts!)  Please could we put that role on one of the guys next time.  By no means did she get on my nerves, it's just she was bringing me down from the whole road trip, fun w/friends, sour puss face but maybe I'm over reacting...

To Anyone Looking for something new, something frightening, gross, suspenseful, if you love a road trip, if Halloween is your thing then this movie is not to be missed.  I know, I know, there's no IMBd rating, nor are there any other ratings from our usual dependable horror reviewers (The Movie Guy, Ghoststar Original) but there will be and I think they'll agree with me that this is an original story with exceptional, scary-as-hell ghouls and goblins.

Take this one out for a spin - you'll enjoy the ride.",1412899200,10,1294,4.523605150214593

6708361,4,B00O3QAW50,I heard it was good but I was a little disappointed in the story-line. It could have been a little better..,1509840000,,107,4.142857142857143
6708362,1,B00O3QAW50,"Besides several idiots in an RV, visiting a number of set-up haunted houses in the Southern US - what was the point of this movie ?  Simply carrying a shotgun with them, during their quest, would have prevented their fate.",1509408000,,222,4.55
6708363,1,B00O3QAW50,85% of the film is just secondhand haunted house footage which is not a good film experience for the viewer. Around that is the most standard paint by numbers horror plot imaginable. If you told me to make a movie about a haunted house tour i would come up with the plot of this movie beat for beat in about 5 minutes.,1509235200,,318,4.145161290322581
6708364,1,B00O3QAW50,Unlikable characters. Lame dialogue. Weak scares. Honestly I experienced more frightening moments trying to find parking at my grandson's elementary school Fall Festival than I had watching this movie. I've been more scared watching promos for the very kinds of haunted houses this movie is about than anything shown here. Not even up to the worst episode of Fear the Walking Dead. Waste of 90 minutes.,1508544000,,402,5.106060606060606
6708365,2,B00O3QAW50,This had a lot of promise but didn't really go anywhere.  The ending is very half-hearted.,1507680000,,90,4.625
6708366,1,B00O3QAW50,"The only reason I'm giving this a 2 is because of the interesting content that may or may not be real revolving around their interviews with haunted house workers. It's boring, predictable, and I think by now everyone with a clown phobia has made a decision to avoid movies like this, not flock to them.

For those of us looking for a thoughtful movie, a scary movie, a movie that you'll look back on the next day and go ""Damn, that was good,"" this is not it. This is lazy, self-indulgent and drags across the screen like the corpse we never get dragged off camera but kind of wish we do, since nobody is the least bit likable. You sit through the end because you think, as with most FF movies, the slow build will pay off. It does not. If you think you can guess the ending, you're probably right, if you're over the age of eight. That's about as much worldly experience you need to call it.

You want to be scared sleepless? You want amazing writing and genius use of FF perspective? You want Hell House LLC. That movie kicks this house's butt, on so, so many levels.

I watched this thinking I'd get a least a similar thrill ride, and what I got was held hostage on a stupid RV for an hour and a half of my life. Oh, and hey, literally everyone involved with this movie? I also see there's a sequel who's trailer advertises any semblance of what you wanted us to believe about the endingthat right there kills your market for those who you wanted to leave hanging. You guys need to get off this ride before you dig your own grave.",1507507200,,1533,4.279310344827586

6708368,2,B00O3QAW50,"I have to say, as a horror movie buff, I'm very disappointed. I feel like there was no climax to the film. A lot more could have been done with this. When the friends wake up in coffins, I was definitely thinking something more would (should)  take place and then the credits started rolling. It feels like an unfinished film, and on a scale of 1 to 10 for scary-ness, I give it a 1 if that. I mean, unless you're the type to jump at the smallest thing, it's not at all scary. Despite this however, I may just watch the second one just to see if it gives me closure, haha.",1506902400,,572,4.061946902654867
6708369,5,B00O3QAW50,Different kind of horror. If you like going to haunted houses then you will like this movie. It is hand held camera footage but it works well with this movie. The acting is good with a disturbing ending.,1505692800,,203,4.368421052631579
6708370,5,B00O3QAW50,I thought this movie was well done.  I have seen it a few times now and still enjoy it every time I watch it.  When I am scanning my watchlist and see it scroll by I always at least consider watching it and if I am not looking for something specific to watch I will either pick this or Dale and Tucker vs Evil.  I have never really been a huge fan of found film types but this one I thought was done in a way that didn't feel overdone.  I love haunts so this movie appealed to me in that way.  I think it is worth a watch if you are looking for a good Halloween movie to get you into the spirit or to sate you if you already are.,1505088000,,629,3.734848484848485

6708372,5,B00O3QAW50,"The Houses October Built blurs the line between reality and fiction, managing to leave viewers on edge following a group searching for extreme haunts. Admitedly the first time I viewed it, I didn't quite understand it's point; however, after watching the documentary within the special features section, I have a newfound respect for what this group of people did. I own it now in three different forms just so that I can always watch it or loan it out to friends. At the very least, if you don't like found-footage, it brings a new twist and is a fun Halloween themed film to view and discuss with friends.",1499904000,,607,4.62962962962963

6708380,4,B00O3QAW50,"I found this movie a little over a year ago and it was a great find. I've recently watched it again just to see how I feel about it sometime later. I still very much like the movie. But this second watch, it left me wondering about a few things:

1. The over all plot is a group of people touring Texas and going to haunts and searching for that one extreme haunt. In the end  it seems  they found it.  But how far did that extreme haunt go?

2. There also seems to be another, smaller plot going on. From the very first haunt they attend, it seems the group angers some people at the haunts they are going to and then they start following them around. This is where things get very confusing about the movie. How are these ""haunters"" able to track our group. And another question, how are they able to just disappear into thin air, as seen towards the end of the movie. And finally, is this group of people tied in with the Blue Skeleton group? It's never really made completely clear.

Over all it's a good movie...great to watch around Halloween. Give it a try.",1484352000,,1064,4.242574257425742
6708381,5,B00O3QAW50,"I loved this movie, so much so that I had to purchase it. It was full of creepy moments , just what I like in a movie. The ending was shocking to me, no spoilers here!

6708389,3,B00O3QAW50,"I'm basically echoing what everyone else is saying, but i think it should have decided what kind of movie it was going to be, before filming.
I do understand that most places will not allow people to record inside the haunts, which makes sense,However, all the ""behind the scenes"" footage kept taking me out of the whole idea of a found footage horror movie. It read more like a documentary, until they hung in the RV, strip club, and random bar, oh and screamed a lot with some re-occurring characters showing up.
Maybe that sounds harsh of me, but i feel like it had the basis of either movies down, and ended up just kind of throwing in the towel when editing, or realizing they didn't film enough either way.
I just wish it would have chosen a genre/subtype and stuck to it, because it had the ideas of something great.",1458777600,,823,4.456953642384106

6708398,5,B00O3QAW50,"While I didn't watch the film all the way through this time around (saw it before I bought the blu-ray) I can say the hour or so that I watched was even better the second time around. The picture quality is awesome.

I love streaming movies as it's convenient but you're not going to get the picture and sound a blu ray offers. For a film like this, it counts. If you would like to add on to the experience of this film, go to you tube and watch some videos on McKamey Manor - it's an extreme haunt place in San Diego that has a lot of people upset (even though it's completely staged and the participants are truly free to stop whenever they want....the owner edits his videos that reflect otherwise and it's actually a pretty brilliant move).

For the movie itself, it's just a fun, freaky watch. there are so many subtleties used in the film (encounters where people dressed in costumes just stand and stare) and they really end up getting to you after a while. It really is one of the best horror flicks to come out in some time.",1448236800,,1033,4.292307692307692

6708404,1,B00O3QAW50,"Nine Things About  the Movie ""The Houses October Built""

1. I've seen some really bad found-footage horror films, but this movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. It is proof that just because you have a video camera at home and have an idea for a movie, that doesn't mean you should actually make it.

2. The idea of the movie isn't bad. It's supposed to be about a group of 5 people who are tired of the regular haunted house attractions that pop up before Halloween, and they go on a cross-country quest in their RV for a rumored real one that doesn't fake the things that happen inside.

3. Unfortunately, most of the movie is either pointless conversation between the characters (who sometimes read poems), or sloppy camera footage inside real haunted house attractions. I suspect that the script must have been written when the writer (and star of the movie), Zack Andrews, was stoned.

4. Nobody tries to explain why they need six video cameras (with infinite batteries and storage space) strapped to the inside and outside of their RV. How many times are they going to want to watch something from the position of their tire? Or what you can see behind the vehicle?

5. I think one of the main characters was supposed to be a serial killer, but nobody ever really seemed bothered that the dude brought girls to the RV at night, and then he wore their clothes the next morning after the girl disappeared. They were too busy discussing where they should go next while rolling up joints.

6. While walking toward one of their nightly haunted houses, one of characters said something to the effect that it looked like it was made by bored teenagers. Which is funny, because I had just thought the same thing about the movie.  I think most of the budget was spent on those rubber masks you can buy from Halloween stores starting about Labor Day.

7. Some of the footage inside the haunted houses had some chilling and unsettling moments. I think. It's too bad the person holding the camera was usually screaming and waving the camera around, so you mostly just saw blurs of light and plastic or plywood walls.

8. For some reason, a couple of the monsters in one of the haunted houses appeared again halfway across the country an another house. I'm not sure if this meant supernatural trickery was happening, or if the filmmakers just couldn't afford another mask.

9. This could have been an interesting movie. But once again, the no-budget found-footage gimmick, combined with a rambling script that never answered any of the questions it made you ask, turned this film into something more boring than watching pumpkin seeds dry.",1445558400,,2636,4.6594827586206895
6708405,5,B00O3QAW50,Very creepy movie!!,1445558400,,19,5.666666666666667
6708406,3,B00O3QAW50,I should have looked on Netflix first! Lol it would have been free! Lol well almost.,1444867200,,84,4.3125
6708407,4,B00O3QAW50,"The film opens with a group of 5 friends: Zack; his girlfriend, Brandy; Bobby; Jeff; and Mikey, who rent an RV and decide to tour some of Texas' most famous and scariest independent haunted houses for the last 5 days of October, leading up to Halloween.  The 5 are craving for the creepiest, craziest, scariest, most extreme and over the top haunted house that will give them a scare they'll never forget

They learn of a particular haunted house in particular that changes locations each year but remains in the same setting: the backwoods. They ask several townspeople about the particular house in are told of horrifying, real-life, terrifying events that happened at the house and advise them not to go there. They think it's nothing and still plan to go. Along the trip, they stop at most of the haunt houses and eventually begin to pick up clues regarding a crew called The Blue Skeleton that will lead them to their destination.

It's fun by day and terror by night as the group experience weird and chilling happenings each night in the wake of their search for the haunted house. It soon becomes clear that instead of looking for the haunt, the haunt has come to them and they're trapped right in the middle of what they wanted. But is it just for laughs or have these 5 put themselves in the crossroads of true evil?

Overall: I can't see what the bad reviews are for. The Houses October Built was a neat concept of a movie with a clever plot as it manages to take almost every aspect of Halloween, put them together, and make this creepy, yet interesting and somewhat sadistic movie. It's almost like the film wants you to put yourself in the characters' shoes. Say you're looking for the ultimate scare in a haunted house for Halloween. One that goes too far and crosses the line. One that you're not sure is meant for fun or meant for evil. Would you or would you not be scared? Halloween is one of--if not the THE funnest night of the year and The Houses October Built puts a ruthless and perverse twist on that fun night. The film mixes elements of Blair Witch Project and is really similar to it in terms of the plot and what the characters are looking for. Now in this day and age, I'm not a fan of found footage horror simply because I think the genre has been overexposed and become overrated, but Houses October Built was a bit of an exception just because I enjoyed the free flow of the movie and how it kind of strayed from the 30 other found footage horror movies made over the last 5 years or so. The only thing I can say that really bothered me about this film was the ending. It's a rushed head scratcher, no one really knows what happened or what was supposed to happen, or if it's an opened ending meant to lead to a sequel. I've seen too many horror movies that were pretty good for the most part, only to be flawed with an abysmal, rushed, nonsensical ending that leaves more unanswered questions than answers. In closing, what I really liked was the psychological story the movie tells. Perhaps the monsters aren't the costumes, facepaint, and masks; but the humans that lie underneath them. Humans who use haunted houses as a means to take out their anger and rage on innocent people that come to their attraction. Overall, The Houses October Built is a great and exciting Halloween horror flick to kick back and enjoy this Halloween season if you want something different from the occasional Michael Myers scare",1444867200,,3444,4.523274478330658

Its about a group of friends that go to different haunted house attractions looking for the ultimate thrill but then things start to happen. I feel had it maybe been a normal shot movie instead of found footage it would've been a lot better, they could've also spent more time investigating or actually in the ultimate haunt they were seeking instead of wasting too much time on others. The ending could have also been much better then it is. It might be worth a rent just to check out but seeing it will make you sad when you realize what it could have been if it went in a different direction.

But I'll definitely give the makers of ""Houses"" some solid props when it comes to cooking up an inventive concept. In a nutshell (pumpkin shell?), a group of friends go on a pilgrimage of sorts to visit every out-of-the-way ""serious scare"" haunted house they can manage to find in the five days leading up to Halloween. Their penultimate goal is to locate a nearly mythical, ultra-elusive haunt that changes locations every year, but leaves a trail of cryptic social media breadcrumbs for those brave (or foolish?) enough to seek it out. I won't spoil the ending here, but suffice it to say that the ""getting there"" part has a few solid elements going for it. For example, the interplay between the friends does, in fact, sound completely believable and unforced when they're allowed to ad lib (the scripted bits, not so much). Also, interspersed behind-the-scenes interview footage with some of the actual haunted house cast members ranges from highly entertaining to disturbingly thought-provoking (i.e., think about which is more scary: a fabricated scene of four ghouls violently assaulting an innocent young girl with a chainsaw; or the fact that the four guys playing these ghouls are in reality having the time of their lives enacting this sort of thing repeatedly). I actually agree with certain critics who argued that this movie might have worked best as a straight-up documentary. Between the interviews and the fact that some of these real-life haunted houses apparently permitted (??) filming inside the halls/mazes/cornfields/catacombs themselves (which I always thought was the most absolute of no-no's), there's enough solid footage here to make this movie worth a viewing. The ending is a bit of a hot mess, but hey -- so what if things didn't come together perfectly? Everyone involved deserves some serious points for trying something new and creative. Hey now, there's a concept.",1436313600,,2086,5.1382352941176475

Bobby, Zack, Jeff, Mikey, and Brandy are on a quest to find the most extreme and obscure haunted houses. They are tired of the sugar coated amusement park crap and want something more. Together they embark on five day road trip across the South in their RV to backwater haunted houses with dubious legality. With their winning personalities and disregard for other people, they piss off a few of the haunts in their wake, leading to some tense and dangerous situations. One such haunt seems to be following them wherever they go, no matter how far away. Are they regular people just angry at them? Are they criminals or something more supernatural? The group also stumbles across the most extreme of haunts called Blue Skeleton that needs clandestine meetings and secret passwords. Will it be what they're looking for or will it prove too dangerous?

In the past, I was never a fan of haunted houses and horror mazes because I've always been high strung. In the past few years, I finally went to various theme park Halloween events and had a blast. The characters in the film are tired of these events and want something more. I enjoyed the documentary type segments where they question scare actors, fans of these events, and creators of haunted houses. Their quest begs the question where should the line be drawn? There can only be so much done and guarantee the safety of the guest. The faux documentary explores a little of what people do to make their haunts more extreme: employ actual psychopaths and criminals, allow the guests to be attacked, use of actual body parts, and even the accidental inclusion of actual death. I can see signs of this in the real world, especially in the attraction Blackout where guests sign away their rights and are then manhandled, waterboarded, tied up, and sexually assaulted. I think this film is an answer to this growing trend.

The narrative story of the film is equally interesting to the documentary bits. The style is found footage, which I don't have a problem with when done well. The main source is the group's cameras as they film their trek, but also other people's cameras, security cameras, and the like. I enjoyed the videos through all the different haunts. It starts off fairly standard with mainly jump scares which you can see in any walk through a horror maze., Then it builds suspense in the rest of the film and really creates an atmosphere of dread. The later haunts although not horrible worse lose the air of fun and become more alarming. All is fun and games until the first haunt and then a clown wouldn't move from the front of the car, just staring menacingly. Then the creepy porcelein doll girl followed them over a hundred miles to freak them out with her maniacal laughter and it escalates from there. One of the best scenes of the film is when the whole troupe of scare actors stood in front of their RV in the middle of the night after scaring the friends awake and then suddenly disappeared. The very end with the last haunt is taut with tension and I was on the edge of my seat.

Unfortunately, the film falters in a few places. The characters are fine, but make some dumb decisions and are unlikeable at times. The guys are very bro-like and macho. They cause trouble for no reason at all or maybe just for their own amusement. Brandy seems totally against the entire endeavor and doesn't seem to even enjoy haunts. It begs the question why she's even there except to have a stereotypical screaming, hysterical girl. The very ending is so very disappointing. I get that the filmmakers wanted it to be vague and up to interpretation, but it seemed more like a copout. You never really know if the characters die at the end. I don't think they did, but the ending would be pretty anticlimactic if they were shown to survive. The Blue Skeleton haunt isn't completely unknown, so it is doubtful at best that they could succeed in murdering people every single year.

The Houses October Built is a well constructed film that builds tension and suspense right up until the end. The makeup is impressive, especially when contrasting the very real looking Blue Skeleton scare actors' makeup with all the others that are more typical and slap-dash. Even with my problems with it, I had a great time watching it. The feeling of dread in the pit of my stomach when I watched it is more important than the small details. This is a perfect movie to watch for Halloween and I will put it in my yearly October watch list along with Halloween and Trick 'r Treat.",1436227200,,4540,4.6347826086956525

This movie didn't seem to have to many positive reviews but the trailer looked pretty interesting & I thought I'd give it a whirl. The movie is about a group of filmmakers looking for the best haunted houses in America during Halloween. It has a genuine feel to it & moves pretty well. It turns into a horror film when they are caught filming & some actors don't take kindly to it & start to harass the group as they move from town to town it seems. This is where the film gets a bit creepy as they encounter people outside there RV & get an invite to the most extreme attraction called Blue Skelton. I will say the ending sucked but overall a good little film. I watched it when I couldn't sleep one morning & usually fall back asleep but this one did keep me interested. I highly recommend seeking out the Blu-ray version of the film that includes as a bonus the documentary that inspired the film. Not a bad film but with a little bit of editing & better ending this could have been a winner.,1434240000,,1070,4.25

Their destination finally lands them in Louisiana for what may be the ultimate experience. -summary

The found footage style of horror receives a lot of hate and rightfully so. Many of these films hope to provide a gripping, life like POV experience but the end results are usually disastrous, in fact, almost always to the point of even being unwatchable. Director Bobby Roe must have understood this and he shot for a pretty original premise and did a fine enough job in delivering a rather creepy experience.

The plot follows the five friends which is made up of four guys and one girl, as they travel from one haunted house to another. Along the way they hear of a truly extreme type of experience delivered by a traveling attraction called Blue Skeleton, where its said by some people that they will go as far as possible to deliver a truly frightening experience just short of killing the people whom are looking for a good time. This immediately grabs Zack's interest as he pushes forward to find this acts next location.

The Houses October Built is definitely among the better found footage horror movies out there. While it does have its flaws which I will address, it does manage to work really well with its horror elements as the movie progresses. The characters have a very natural feel to them to the point where I believe many viewers will feel for them, and certainly hopes nothing bad happens to them because they aren't out looking for trouble nor bothering anyone, and simply don't come off as jerks.

The movie tries to fully follow a documentary style and it provides a decent enough, inside look on the fright techniques used inside of haunted houses. If these things are for real then I would love to check one out some day. These places seem to be pitch dark, full of wild gimmicks, and creepiness around every twist and turn; this is clearly meant to rope in the viewer in hopes to blur the line on what's real and not real, and this later works into the movie's plot and climax down the road.

The movie works very well with its horror elements and the documentary style which creeps up again later delivering the chills. I was never scared while watching the movie, but I was definitely concerned for the characters safety and for that I have to give this movie points.

The only real gripes I can think of is that the movie couldn't stick with one particular style; it shifted quite a bit from the documentary style to a fictional horror format, and this did rub me the wrong way in regards to pacing and being able to properly settle down and fully enjoy the movie. It was also unbelievably predictable because anyone will be able to tell where this was going.

When it comes down to what I look for in my horror movies; I can say that The Houses October Built did a nice enough job not only holding my attention but arousing some type of emotion because the ending made me angry, yet this was in a good way.  I liked the acting and chemistry among the characters; I could feel their fear when they couldn't draw the line between real and phony. This is not the type of horror movie for the gore hounds. I mainly recommend this to the type looking for some type of story free from the severed limbs and stuff. It's not exactly a great movie I'll admit, but I won't say it's bad either.

Pros: Very interesting story and plot, likeable and believable characters, some creepy moments

Cons: Overly predictable, style alters pacing some",1432425600,2,3711,4.599092284417549

6708432,4,B00O3QAW50,"I don't know that I enjoyed The Houses October Built as a horror movie so much as I enjoyed it as a premise for a documentary. Yet another found footage horror movie, it was better than a lot of them but not even close to as good as the best.
It would be a fun way to spend the time leading up to Halloween, traveling around the country to find increasingly more extreme haunted houses and the like. The fact that I could easily see myself in the position of the amateur filmmakers of this movie served to make it more enjoyable than it might have otherwise been.
The bizarre and surreal way that the group begins to get tormented and harassed along the way is certainly more interesting than it could have been, and in their position those things would be scary as hell. As the movie builds towards the climax, it becomes clear that they are getting precisely what they were looking for, something terrifying; but they would have been better off not getting what they asked for. I was more invested in the characters than I am where most of these found footage movies are concerned, but that was in large part because I could relate to the impulse that inspired the journey they were on.
In a sense there could be some correlations drawn between the antagonists in this movie and those from The Strangers, just on a larger scale. I assume that the moral of this story is that it can be dangerous to seek out greater and greater thrills, and to be damn careful what you wish for.
Like the haunted houses and scare attractions this movie focuses on, the movie itself relies strongly on jump scares...but it does manage to establish a nice and tense feeling of expectation, which is more than I expected.
It's worth watching, if only because there is a bit of unexplored country involved in the focus on Halloween haunts gone horribly awry...also there were some clowns, and everyone loves clowns.",1431820800,,1895,4.543859649122807

They ended the docu-add on with a Blue Skeleton add in too, but alternate version.  The MOVIE then was inspired to build on this to greater extent and re-tell it deeper.  My only criticism is the Blue Skeleton ending is weak and Id have liked better build up and clarity of events, but apart from that the film is one I liked and will re-watch.  Having the added features on the Blu Ray really made it even better  so if they also are on the DVD normal version, Id suggest getting itgood creepy film and fun way to pass an evening.",1431475200,,957,4.2076502732240435

The found footage format may be getting old to some but I have to admit that when done right, it is excellent. There are some straight classics out there to be enjoyed, and then there are the others. Sadly this is one of the others, but not by much. I had high expectations going in and maybe I shouldnt have. I blame it on the great trailer that was released for the film.

The film follows a group of friends rolling through my great state of Texas looking for the best haunted house attraction, they find some good ones. But while doing this they hear about one that is supposed to be the best of the bunch, one that travels and never stays in the same place. So the hunt is on, travel from haunt to haunt finding the clues and maybe getting the invite to the big event.

I have to say that this film does look excellent and was shot wonderfully. It feels real and the characters interactions add to that. The cast does a great job portraying these characters and the crew did just as well with the production. The drawback here though is indeed the characters, they are very unlikeable. At first it is only the A-Hole of the group [which is to be expected] but as the film goes on they each do things to annoy the audience. I won't go into detail but there is one scene in particular where the group is wrong in doing what they do but, well you will see.

This is from the producers of Insidious and Paranormal Activity which I enjoyed, both of them. The thing is both of those films are better especially when compared to this and it lay within two determining factors, one was previously mentioned. The other in my opinion is the ending, which I will not give away. I am not alone in this as others here have pointed out the same thing. Still it is worth a watch since it does feel real and there are some cool looking haunts and people that work there, it is a fun flick.",1430265600,,1904,4.251381215469613

6708443,3,B00O3QAW50,"The Houses October Built exemplifies the best and worst traits and potentials for the found footage subgenre. In fact, it seems to step into every stereotype haters of the genre always (usually rightly) complain about: total lack of character development or even interesting characters (the kinds you look forward to seeing killed), totally useless dialogue, lack of character motivation, poor decision making, random 'interviews' that don't provide useful information, no explanation for having cameras rolling 24/7, and plot holes large enough for a double-wide. This film should have been a short, maybe 45 minutes. There is at most 30 minutes of truly quality footage. However, I gave it three stars (I'd prefer 2.5, if I could) because the film also takes full advantage of the subgenre by placing the viewer within truly horrifying haunted houses and (no real spoiler here) an even worse real-world haunt. My wife and I watch a lot of horror films and plenty of found footage ones, and the few scary parts in October really got under our skins. The horror was palpable; the haunted houses terrifying; the masks memorable; the finale quite satisfying. When things finally spin out of control, the film got pretty good. Of course, we didn't have enough investment in the characters to care, but found footage allows you place yourself in the situation, and doing this made the film (overall) a worthwhile watch.

I love going to these Halloween attractions every year, and the idea of a film based on these attractions sounded really cool. Unfortunately ""The Houses October Built"" is just another found footage no-budget, no scares, unimaginative horror film. Even for a lazy genre like found footage, this is a lousy film. Most found footage films just feel like hastily slapped together films using the found footage gimmick to hide the lack of F/X and small budget, but ""Houses"" feels really cheap. What should be a slam dunk, watching the stars walk through the various haunted attractions, falls very flat. The filmmakers don't capture the fun or scares of the attractions filmed, they actually manage to film very little of anything through extremely poor camera work, either it's too shaky, not focused or zoomed in too tight to make out what we are supposed to be looking at.

A horror movie set in the world of haunted house or extreme scare industry is brilliantly simple and fresh. But this movie somehow thought an extended road trip and filming of these would suffice enough in terms of either plot or scares. Its far more of a documentary travel show, than a horror film. The thing doesnt even try to have a single scare in the first half, as the viewer is asked to spend an even more horrifying time hanging out with the bland leads. Then the next section becomes a rote travelogue where the camera takes us through some actual haunts. While some of these are amusing to see, there are zero stakes since they are fake houses. In the final half hour, the film finally embraces its promised premise of the characters visiting a fake haunted house that isn't haunted. By then, however, the film has run out of gas money and ideas. There are no big budget effects in the end, just an uninspired conclusion cobbled together from cheap masks and duct tape.",1424131200,,1078,4.590673575129534

Yes, this is another hand held camera film, one that is realistic enough, you might not want to watch it. I liked the various haunted houses and how the same characters kept showing up at different locations. The ending was a bit of a let down.

6708487,4,B00O3QAW50,"I first want to say that this is my personal review of the movie (which may or may not contain spoilers) and this is my own personal feelings on it.

I guess I'll start off by saying, if you are waiting for Amazon to have this movie in stock, it will be a while. It is a Best Buy Exclusive right now. Finding one in a Best Buy may be difficult as they don't carry too many quantities of the movie as it is not a Blockbuster movie (it's more of a B class horror movie) and forget trying to order one off their website because it just says ""Coming Soon Release Date 1/06/15"". I imagine it is a in-store exclusive as well. If you don't like owning the physical disc, there is always ITunes where you can purchase and own it digitally.

Now that I mentioned that. The Houses October Built is one of those obscure horror movies that has a unique storyline but lacks in other departments of the film. The movie is about  (if you haven't read this enough) five friends who are looking for the most extreme haunted house in the country. They go from place to place in their RV and eventually hear about a place called ""Blue Skelton"", which is said to be the most extreme haunted house. But is it really the best haunted house or just another run of the mill?

The movie starts out by explaining that this was a found footage of the five friends (which I will borrow a sentence from another review of this movie, ""if this is found footage, we already know what happen to the five friends"") . It shows our heroes in a bar getting excited to start their trip the next day, when it cuts to the next scene, they are in their RV and begin to start their travel. They travel to different well know haunted houses in different states while interviewing some of the actors and owners. I will stop there, because I don't want to go too far in to it for people who have yet to see this movie.

The good things about this movie:
I liked the concept of this movie, I personally thought it was original with the haunted house thing as not too many horror movies go this route (sticking to usually slashers, paranormal, creatures etc).

The interviews with the owners and actors of some of the haunted houses was also great. They give their personal insight working in these places as well as stories they have heard (weather they are true or fiction).

The fact they go through some of the places is fun. It's like watching a walk through on YouTube and seeing how the cast reacts to some of scares in the haunted houses.

The characters can suck you into the film making you feel like part of the experience.

Some of the costumes are very well done and unique looking.

Some of the bad things are:

The movie is 100% done by camcorder view and cellphone view (so they want you to believe). There are times in the movie where it will go completely black screen and your listening to audio, at these times you find yourself saying ""Night vision please"" so you can see what is going on.

The plot of the movie gets lost towards the middle of the film. I found myself sometimes going ""wait a minute....what is going on? What are they talking about?"". As the film goes from interviews and seeing haunted houses to we have to find this place called ""Blue Skelton"".

The people on the cover of the DVD/Blu Ray appear in the film a total of 2 or 3 times and that's pretty much it that you see of them.

The ending for the film just makes you want more as it's not anything to look forward too.

Probably the most disappointing thing for me (as well as many others who have watched this film) is the trailers for the film almost depicts that it is NOT a found footage film but an actual movie, but they went the found footage route.

Now to talk about the features on the disc. The Blu Ray disc contains ""The Full-length Documentary that inspired the film"", ""Behind the Screams an inside look at the haunts"", ""Portrait of a scare artist photo gallery"", ""Cast Carvings by the pumpkin geek"" and ""Deleted Scenes"". I believe the DVD only has a few of these special features but not all.

First I will say that the pumpkin carvings feature isn't anything spectacular and it's just pictures of the cast members on pumpkins (wow...). Probably the worst feature on the disc.

Portraits of a scare artist photo gallery, is cool but again nothing spectacular.

Behind the scream is a mini documentary that shows each haunted house in the film (I believe there was 1 or 2 that were not featured in the film and are shown here) as well as a fictional trailer for the film (when I say ""fictional trailer"" I mean it doesn't show any parts of the movie but it does show pictures from different places with words across the pictures describing the movie).

Deleted Scenes are sometimes great or they can be a complete bomb. There is a few scenes that give more insight to the movie and are extended in time (running for about 2 to 3 minutes).

The best thing about the features is the full length documentary. What we have here is basically 2 movies on 1 disc! The full length documentary is the original 2011 release of The Houses October Built. According to IMBD (the movie online database) there was a 2011 release of this movie starring the same exact people. This version of the movie is actually WAY better than the 2014 release. It's still done in found footage style  and starts off by an interview with a guy who plays as the wicked witch from The Wizard of Oz talking about how he has always been obsessed with the original wicked witch and he has an interesting story to tell. It than picks up with the cast getting ready to set out and they explore more of the haunted houses, do more interviews, more conversations with the five friends, a better understanding of the plot, less nonsense  and a true ending that was much, much better  (this is how is should have ended).

Bottom line, I'm giving The Houses that October built a 4 out of 5 stars. I think the movie had an original idea that got lost somewhere in the middle of the film but it does give you your money's worth. It is not a terrible film as some have reviewed it, but not all horror films have to be blood, guts, language and nudity. If your looking to get this film, I strongly recommend getting it on Blu Ray for the extra special feature and $12.99 is not a bad price. If horror movies released as exclusives and that are obscure have taught me anything, I would say once this movie goes out of print, it will become harder and harder to find because of it's unique concept.

I hope you enjoyed my review and please remember, this is just my review and sometimes reviews don't do justice until you have seen it yourself :-).",1421280000,,6659,4.367313915857605
6708488,1,B00O3QAW50,"I love haunted houses and I thought this movie might be great, but I was really disappointed.  It was hard to follow, and honestly, as a woman, constant threats of sexual assault against the only female character in the movie were really off putting and made it very difficult to want to follow the rest of the confusing story line.  There was very little about haunted houses, which, while I understand now what the movie was about, I still find pretty disappointing.",1421193600,,468,4.695121951219512

Everyone knocks found footage, but it's really just a different camera POV style.  I don't mind it.  It let's you get closer to the characters and care about them more.

Those are the underlying themes of this movie. It's about five friends who go out looking for the most ""extreme"" haunted house. The first half of the movie is pretty much a crappy, poorly-filmed tour of such real-life locations in Texas. Then they go looking for the Blue Skeleton, an underground haunt that changes location from year to year and is said to be the most extreme of extreme scares. They get more than they bargained for. As a reviewer, this movie made me speechless. It was awful, a poorly-filmed sadistic nightmare with no purpose. I spent a good while typing various things to say about the movie, and all I can say is that, well, it got a rise out of me. It didn't bore me, it wasn't unoriginal, but man oh man do I hate it.

So, take that for what it's worth. However, this movie certainly did an excellent job at building a gritty, realistic, creepy atmosphere. It really brought out the depravity in the dark subject matter.

I found the characters to be well acted and believable. They were a breath of fresh air from the average group of college bros that usually head these sorts of films.

The tactics that they used in the film were fairly unique. I can't say all of the content in the film was original, or done first here, but nothing felt like it was overdone.

We are presented with 5 generic hipster friends who rent a large RV and go around the South looking for ""real"" haunted house experiences.  I found the hipsters irritating and they never really manage to make the viewer care about them.  Of the 5 of them only the female garners some bit of sympathy but just barely and it's really only towards the end.

I had never heard of this movie and the only reason I rented it was due to the 4 star reviews.  Big mistake.  The producers must have paid their friends to over rate the movie.",1414368000,,656,4.470588235294118

Now slasher flicks are not my favorite subgenre of horror, but, when Hallows time comes around I cant help myself. I did read the reviews before hand, and decided to go ahead and give this movie a shot.
If you like going to haunted houses, and really enjoy the Halloween season, the movie is a bit nostalgic at times. It is done in a docu-found footage style...
Now the approach was interesting, and it did have some creepy moments, but the ending sucked. Overall, it would have been a three star movie, but the end kind of killed it for me. We spend almost the whole of the movie, with a ramp up to, What the hell is going to happen when they finally get to the Blue Skeleton Haunt and then were treated to 10 min of sub par haunted house crap and end

6708562,3,B00O3QAW50,"Okay, I don't get all the hate for Found Footage films. I am actually a huge fan of the genre. IF they're made right. There is a right way to do them, and a wrong way. That is heavily debated, however. I personally thought The Blair Witch Project was an example of a Found Footage film done right. An example of one done wrong...well there's plenty to be named, and it isn't fair because Found Footage is such a great idea for a horror film. It's supposed to create a sense that what you are watching is real and is not funded by Hollywood or a big time film company. Try watching ""Spirit In The Woods"", and you will know what a bad Found Footage film is.

""The Houses October Built"" isn't necessarily bad. It's set around the Halloween season, where a group of friends are traveling around Texas to find the most extreme haunted house experience around. Great concept. The haunted houses they encounter on their trip were well filmed I thought. Mostly it's all pitch-dark-quick-glimpse-scare shots, but hey, that's what happens inside haunted house attractions. The thing that bugged me was that these places allowed them to go in with a camera? Most of them in reality prohibit any camera of any kind. But you have to suspend your disbelief to enjoy just about any film of this genre.

Then the group catches word of a ""Blue Skeleton"" Haunted House attraction. And as you may gave already guessed, this one is the one that  truly terrifies the group of friends. The entire time in this Blue Skeleton place (which is in the middle of nowhere) the group is constantly wondering if this is all real or not. And as the viewer, it creates a sense of urgent panic for the characters.

I don't like to do spoiler reviews, so I'll keep my mouth shut about how this one ends. All I will say is that the end leaves something to be desired. In my opinion, a better ending could have been written. That is why I am giving this 3 stars instead of 4. The unfullfilling ending gets a star docked from the rating. I remember saying when the credits rolled, ""What, that's it?""

It's worth a rental.",1413504000,22,2083,4.471052631578948
6708563,2,B00O3QAW50,"The filmmakers waste an offbeat premise with very poor execution.  A group of friends in an RV hit a bunch of haunted house Halloween attractions in different states, looking for the mythical and supposedly terrifying Blue Skeleton Haunted House, an underground extreme scare attraction which changes locations every year.  So yep--It's yet another camcorder horror film, as if the world needed another one of those.

The acting in The Houses October Built is above average for this type of thing and the characters are mostly likable.  The use of interview footage with haunted house workers and the occasional attraction commercial give the movie the feel of an actual documentary at times.  The main problem is the very poor camera work.  The experiences of going through the various haunted houses they encounter are filmed but if you made a home movie walking through a haunted house it would look better than the footage in this movie.  Through incompetence or design the haunted house sequences are almost all sound-effects and the viewer never sees much of anything because the camera rarely seems to be pointed at whatever is happening.  It's literally like these scenes were not planned in advance at all and the cameraman had no idea which way to point the camera.

One of the workers tells a story about an incident at a haunted house where someone accidentally hung himself and people thought it was part of the show.  Guess what?  Something like that happened for real last week--a worker at an attraction where people kill ""zombies"" with paintball guns accidentally fell under a vehicle and was killed.  Since he was dressed as a zombie the customers thought it was part of the show.  The characters in The Houses October Built even attend a very similar attraction--if the movie wasn't so lousy it might actually attract some controversy or at least benefit from the similarity to real life tragedy.

As the characters go from attraction to attraction they finally get some clues that might lead to the Blue Skeleton Haunted House.  Of course there's also the possibility that the clues lead somewhere else altogether--considering that they find something creepy in the RV fridge and that some other strange things happen along the trip they really should be more concerned that the clues aren't coming from Blue Skeleton at all.

The Houses October built has a promising set-up but it isn't scary or suspenseful and after the movie ends you might find yourself wondering where the footage at the end of the movie came from, exactly--or you might just be happy its over, no questions asked.",1413504000,14,2606,4.95632183908046

Instead of a movie type, they go with the found footage type of style, and tell the story of a group of friends on a road trip to visit and find the best and most insane haunted house attractions in the country, what makes this interesting is that you know those new kind of haunted house attractions opening up around the US the ones that really push the envelope and take it to a different level, no im not talking about those, I mean the haunted house attractions that you must sign a waver before entering.  One of there actors come out to get you any way they feel fit, and your supposed to do whatever they say IE strip naked, get covered in cow's blood, lay in a coffin ect and also endure whatever they make you do sometimes feeling like real human torture, yup those kind.  The thing that is so scary about this movie is that it explores how much we really know and understand about these new attractions which brings up there million dollar question DO ALL EMPLOYEES TAKE A BACKGROUND CHECK BEFORE WORKING AS A ACTOR AT THESE LOCATIONS, AND JUST HOW EASILY A NIGHT OF EXTREME HORROR HOUSE FUN CAN TURN INTO YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE, AFTER ALL WHO WOULD REALLY KNOW IF IT IS REAL OR FAKE, ITS SUPPOSED TO BE EXTREME RIGHT.  Not only that but the film is so real looking it makes you feel this is actually a real video someone made, in fact the first and only found footage film I have actually liked.
