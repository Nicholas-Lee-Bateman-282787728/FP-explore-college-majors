The music -- gosh, don't get me started...it sounds like that royalty-free music that you can use to make home videos. The dialogue, sparse, mumbled by the actors--half the time I couldn't hear what they were saying, and what they did say did nothing to advance the plot or give insight to character. UGH!!",1343433600,8,484,4.511363636363637
5074113,3,B007BOCCAY,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie but when I saw it, it wasn't anything like I excepted it. I thought it was good but not superb. Although I have seen it twice and I'm still kinda fascinated by it. I mean it wasn't a total waste of money but it was entirely a waste of my time looking forward to watching it. The only reason why the movie wasn't as high of my expectations was the ending of it. It is worth seeing just make sure you have low expectations through out the movie.",1342742400,3,486,4.072916666666667
5074114,1,B007BOCCAY,We did not enjoy this movie.  The ending was SO obvious that we both hoped we would be surprised by a twist at the end but sadly it panned out exactly as we feared.  A superb example of sheer mediocrity.  We did not hate the movie we just were disappointed with it.  We rented it from redbox so did not waste too much money but wanted to review to save you losing your money on it by buying it on DVD.  Wait until it is released on TV and when this happens if you have nothing else to do then maybe consider reading a book.,1341273600,7,523,3.942857142857143

5074118,3,B007BOCCAY,"I wanted to like this movie more than I did. Several aspects of the movie fell flat, especially the dialogue and the pacing of the plot. The premise itself was interesting, but I kept hoping the movie was going to much more than it was. By the way, the trailer for the movie is misleading, giving it an ominous/thriller vibe, which the film itself does not have. I wish Jonathan Togo had more to work with, though his acting throughout was the highlight of the film. I found Rich to be sympathetic. Togo conveys the right level of subtlety as the character's mental state unravels in certain scenes.",1411603200,,599,4.555555555555555
5074119,4,B007BOCCAY,"The Identical is a great film with a powerful message and fantastic story line that always keeps you guessing. Its really an enjoyable film to see.

Twins, Ryan Wade and Drexel Hemsley (Blake Rayne) are separated at birth, for financial reasons, during the Great Depression. A preacher and his wife adopt Ryan to give him a better life. Although the boys have different lives, they both share their passion for music. Drexel performs as a famous rock star while Ryan struggles between pleasing his parents and following his dreams.

This film has great music, family principles and really zones in on finding and following your dreams. I also like its captivating and unique story that is beautifully portrayed on the big screen. Its set in 1936, way before my time, but I still enjoyed watching and listening to the music. Blake Ryan plays both of the twins and is able to keep their characters separate. At the same time, he projects the intense connection that twins have between each other. The wardrobe, hairstyles and historical props all contribute to the rich details that create this special period piece.

My favorite scene is when Ryan listens and looks at his twin brother's record album and he does not notice that he looks and sounds exactly like him. This scene is funny because you question why he wouldnt notice it. It seems so oblivious that you cant help but feel bad for him. My favorite character is Ryans Mother, Louise Wade (Ashley Judd), because she is very kind and has a light spirit when you look at her and hear her beautiful voice. You somehow know that she only wants the best for her son.

The Identical also stars Seth Green (Dino) and Ray Liotta (Reece Wade) who contributes their exceptional acting abilities to this film with great humor and emotions.

I love the powerful message in this film which is to follow your dreams and not other peoples. Its your life so work hard to fulfill your dreams and it will make you happy. I recommend The Identical for all the music lovers at heart and ages 10 to 18. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars as I really enjoyed the music, the story line and the message. The Identical rocks in to theaters on September 5th, so please check it out.

5074122,5,B007BOCCAY,"Identical is a movie that will surprise you, on many levels. Every 10 minutes or so, there's a disturbance of some kind, an unexpected event, which thwarts all pre-existing narrative trajectory out of orbit, spiraling viewers into a realm of uncertainty and continuing fascination. It's fresh, artful, complex, dark and twisted, and yet, wholesomely entertaining. Be prepared for an intense experience, with powerhouse performances, intelligent twists and turns, a riveting sense of unease and suspense, with well-rounded character work that gives this whole psychological labyrinth a hue of truth and humanity. It is an independent film that sets example and offers encouragement to all us aspiring indie-filmmakers; no matter the circumstance, the difficulties, or the limitations, with a good enough story, a first-rate cast and a vigorous vision, it's all possible.

Writing this review is doubly beguiling for me, both as a member of the audience and a filmmaker myself. I came out of the theatre completely satisfied. ""Identical"" takes you on a dark and complex ride of identity, betrayal, and sibling rivalry. The premise of the movie sets the tone and intricacy of the narrative by itself: two identical twin brothers fall for the same woman. But of course, it's so, so much more than that. It's a morality tale about identity, obsession, greed, redemption, and reality. Two identical twin brothers are born, and, to keep in touch with the whole mythology of it, one is good and one is evil. The film begins with a gorgeous prologue sequence that sets the film's tone, and the narrative's main conflict. Young actor Aaron Refvem is pitch-perfect in embodying both personalities, making the prologue one of the film's strongest segments. Keep this name in mind, you'll be hearing great things about this kid very very soon, I'm sure of it.

The children grow up to become adult versions of themselves. The dynamic stays the same, and the mythology of the prologue residues on the entire story. The evil brother, Mark, is a ruthless businessman whose world of deceit and corruption is on the brink of collapse, and he will fight for it till the end, exposing the most sinister sides of his personality. Richard is the good brother, who, despite his well-heartedness and benevolence, is a lost soul. He is an artist and a wanderer, a poet and a lover. Truly, no words can adequately praise John Togo's performance as both brothers. He is simply breathtaking in every single frame he's in, and thank God, he's in almost every one. Not only is he wholesomely convincing as both characters, but he goes above and beyond that. He becomes two people so seamlessly that, not for a single moment was there a doubt in my mind as to who I was watching at any given scene. It's an award-worthy tour-de-force performance, and Togo becomes a leading man of such cinematic proportion, that he makes the film completely irresistible, despite its psychological labyrinth and attention-demanding plot, one that will challenge you to question reality as you can't take your eyes off screen. Of course, there are many other things besides Togo that you can't take your eyes off.

Chief among them, the beautiful, elegant, and 21-st century femme-fatale Emily Foxler, who is outstanding as Shelly, Mark's secretary, who both brothers inevitably fall in love with. She is entirely lovable from the first scene she's in. In a way, she plays two characters in her own right. With Mark, she is composed, chic, elegant, and serious, all the traits of a secret-affair-secretary who knows her place. Richard, the good twin, is able to charm that facade away, which is incredibly audience-satisfying, because, through identification (no pun intended) we feel like we are flirting our way into her heart and true personality as well. And once that side of her is out in the open, we want to see it again, hence we root for that relationship to continue. She is an incredible actress, in full control of her body-language and facial expression. Watch her eyes as she performs. Fixed and cold when she is with Mark, playful and full of life when with Richard. Shelly is funny, cute, entirely lovable, and of course, the starting point of a love triangle that propels all characters into a quandary, one which is impossible to speak of without spoiling the movie, so, if you want to know what happens next, you'll have to watch it.

It's not your typical love triangle fable. A lot of it will take you by surprise. Richard becomes so obsessed with regaining Shelly's affection, that he undergoes an arc that is as anti-heroic and anti-formulaic as the character himself. The kindhearted bohemian artist starts gradually behaving more and more like his evil twin. He turns dark, obsessive, and violent, which manifests itself perfectly in a brilliant scene where he takes all his frustration out unto a sexy Bohemian girl he is with - a surprise performance by young actress Kelly Baugher, who, for her limited amount screen time, steals the show. Richard becomes involved in a world of uncertainty, jealousy and mania, and, in turn, we experience a journey of a complex psychological nature, all which comes crumbling down to that essential prologue scene, about the two brothers and their biblical rivalry. The ending is as unpredictable as it is inevitable. And, even though it demands a lot from you, the viewer, it is crafted with precision and clear direction. Togo will blow you away no matter what.

The movie's flaws are inevitable, because of the complex and demanding nature of the narrative itself. The main flaw I can think of right now, is that I probably can't watch it a second time. When the climactic scene came about, I was so surprised and frustrated that so much screen-time had been spent hoodwinking me from that ending. It ends, literally, with a bang and a cut-to-black that will leave you in awe. But then, as I began to reflect back on it, it wasn't that much of a hoodwink, and that's the cleverness of writer/director Daniel Bollag, who intelligently planted seeds throughout the story to foreshadow that final twist. You'd never notice them, but you will discover them and admire their deliberate placement when you think back. And that's what I think makes a good movie. A movie that you have to discuss after you watch it. At times, the narrative may feel disjointed and confusing. Don't worry, it's meant to be that way, and the final 20 minutes will suck you in so intensely that everything will start falling into place. The telling is self-aware, well-paced, and in keep with the protagonist's befuddlement and existential angst. The camera is not imperceptible, it's very much present and emphatic. The narration announces itself in every scene, and it may feel aggressive at first, but it's deliberate and crafty, as fixated and mystifying as the story and characters are. The marriage of form and content is as ferocious as it is beautiful. If there's a word I can think of that can encapsulate the entire feel of the narration, it's this: operatic. And if there's a word that can do the same for the story, it's schizophrenic. So there you have it. ""Identical"" is a schizophrenic opera, a powerful independent film that will surprise you and keep you guessing, as it lures you into its darkness scene after scene.",1363737600,2,7326,4.9287449392712555
