5567264,3,B00BAXTY6M,"When I ordered Flashpoint DVD set it said seasons 1 to 5, however after receiving it I realized that shows were missing.
I went onto Flashpoint TV site and printed out the list of all episodes. In reality you sold seasons 1 to 4, season 5 is
not there at all.  I am disappointed that the there is no season 5 and would like to know where it is!",1374624000,10,344,3.9855072463768115
5567265,5,B00BAXTY6M,I love this series on how they live and survive weather its dealing with life or job problems as a team in all situations. wished they kept this one going,1374364800,,154,4.166666666666667
5567266,5,B00BAXTY6M,I dearly love this show!  I miss Gideon but still think Joe Montagna is also perfect in his role.  Thanks!,1373846400,,106,4.25
5567267,5,B00BAXTY6M,Great series. Wish they went on for more than five seasons.recommend highly if you like action packed movies. Good camaraderie between actors.,1372809600,,142,5.5
5567268,2,B00BAXTY6M,The product was not as it was advertised.  You do not get season five at all and there are three other shows not even included in seasons 1-4.  It was expensive to buy and not get what you were expecting.  Not all of the DVD's are in show order for some reason so it was very disappointing.,1371772800,24,290,4.052631578947368
5567269,1,B00BAXTY6M,I bought all 5 DVDs but all episodes are missing. The 5th season is the 4th season. The 5th is not there. There is no 5th season to buy so the last season is not available on DVD.  This pisses me off what a let down from you amazon.,1371427200,18,232,3.7346938775510203
5567270,3,B00BAXTY6M,i thought i got a good deal on this set until i found out i was only getting 62 of the 75 episodes...i guess the last 13 episodes will be released later this year as the final season of Flashpoint...what really makes me mad is when you read the original air dates listed on the DVD set season 2 started two weeks after season 1 ended and season 5 started two months after season 4...so the way i look at it is they split season 1 and 2 - 4 and 5 in half when the put them on DVD just so they could make more money...i still love the show and I'm sure i will but the final season when it comes out since i already have the first 62 episodes BUT if i had known i was only getting 62 episodes i would not have got them,1370131200,28,715,3.8053691275167787
5567271,5,B00BAXTY6M,"This is my favorite TV show-love the action, characters.  I think there may be some episodes missing, but I can't complain because I can watch these as many times as I like. I would be interested in knowing when/if there will be a DVD with any missing episodes-especially the ending episode- available.",1368403200,,302,4.8076923076923075
5567272,5,B00BAXTY6M,"Flashpoint is yet another favorite TV series canceled much to my dismay.  This is not just another action cop show.  There is incredible technology, suspense and teamwork but what I find most fascinating is the writers took their time, did their research and dug deep into someone's heart and soul in the development of each and every one of the characters.  Enrico Colantoni is a native of Toronto so I imagine this role as Sgt Greg Parker holds a special place in his heart and is among the reasons he plays it to perfection.  BTW, Mr. Colantoni is now playing the super villain, Elias, in my new fav TV show, Person of Interest, which has awesome but considerably different action and technology of Flashpoint, and just two good guys.  Mr. Colantoni plays the super villain role equally well, demonstrating his superb skill as an actor.  I'll be sure to review Person of Interest when I purchase that series.",1362182400,2,911,4.734177215189874
5567303,5,B00BAXTY6M,Great show and was happy to add to my collection.  Would like to get the set for my son.,1412985600,,88,3.6315789473684212

5567305,1,B00BAXTY6M,"Have only tried the first disc so far.  The 1st episode skipped at the end so I didn't get to see the ending, the 2nd episode skipped so badly I couldn't tell what was happening and the 3rd episode only played on fast forward.  I got frustrated and turned  it off.  The seller was of no help; he said it would be up to me to get with the company that puts out the dvd's to get it replaced.",1409097600,,389,3.8860759493670884

5567311,5,B00BAXTY6M,Great show series. Lots of action. Wish I could see the special 6 season without needing a special DVD player.,1399248000,,110,4.55
5567312,1,B00BAXTY6M,I got it in the mail. And went to look at all the shows on it. And i saw that it is missing half the shows in it. There is no season 3 half of 2 is missing. half of 4 is messing DONT BUY IT.,1398643200,,190,3.152173913043478

5567315,5,B00BAXTY6M,I had enjoyed for caught up to watch all season. It is very interesting USA and Canada have different law and cops. I wish that they would count until 10 season. but I think 1-5 seasons are enough.,1396569600,,197,4.2105263157894735

5567317,5,B00BAXTY6M,"I would recommend this show to anyone.  The acting is first rate and the story lines are all exciting and moving.  This show gives you not only the action of a ""cop"" show, but also the underlying emotional effects on the officers.",1393545600,,230,4.4523809523809526
5567318,5,B00BAXTY6M,"I love this series.  I used to be able to watch it every Sunday on one of my cable channels.  But, they have changed to another show.  I wish they would bring it back.",1392681600,,167,3.8529411764705883
5567319,5,B00BAXTY6M,This is one of my favorite series.  Im am so sorry that it will not be seen again in the US. I heard it was still going to be running new shows in Australia.  I hope they make releases that can be reviewed in the US.  The characters are great as well as the acting.  They felt like family.  Same on whoever cancelled them here.,1392076800,,327,3.9692307692307693

5567332,5,B00BAXTY6M,"I love this show!!!
Many reviewers have commented about the seasons being incorrect. Here is the explanation. This is a Canadian Police Drama but CBS apparently owns the rights of distribution. The Show aired in Canada with 5 seasons. For some reason CBS in its ultimate wisdom decided to spread out the show on DVD into 6 season (probably to make more money). So the DVDs you buy in the US, currently only released Seasons 1-5 which correspond to the aired Seasons 1-4. I found no rhyme or reason to how or why they split things up except that they ended the DVD Season 5 with the last show of the Aired Season 4. One would hope that sometime soon CBS will release DVD Season 6, which will have all of the Canadian Aired shows of Season 5.
I live in the US and I found out this information by chatting with someone on the Flashpoint Facebook page. I don't know if there is another set of Canadian DVD's out there that match with the Canadian Aired shows. I somehow doubt it. I still love the show and CBS better release the last season or I will be really upset. I know some people have downgraded their ratings because of the difference, but the show is awesome and as long as you understand that there is one more set of DVD's coming you shouldn't really be that upset. Yes I agree the listing should probably speak to this, but then again maybe the person who listed it didn't even know that CBS has repackaged the shows. I Blame CBS. I've never seen them do this with a US Aired show... Anyway.. Way to go Canada.. you created a great drama here.

5567333,2,B00BAXTY6M,"I don't remember buying from this user, but the last time I tried to buy DVDs from users on this site, I've been duped. I thought I got the complete series of Due South on DVD, also a Canadian show, but I was sent a bag. Not blaming Amazon.com at all, but some people do try to trick you. Buyer beware!",1383091200,,302,3.9672131147540983
5567334,1,B00BAXTY6M,I too will add my disappointment that the DVD 5 Season Set was missing a large number of episodes.  I came to the end of what I thought was Season 5 last night and looked at the list of episodes on the Internet and realized I was missing a significant number of episodes.  Very disappointed.,1381449600,,291,4.2727272727272725
5567335,3,B00BAXTY6M,I love the show.  The set is missing the last season.  Very disappointed.  False advertising that it is the 5 seasons.,1380672000,,118,4.523809523809524
5567366,1,B00BAXTY6M,I watched the show when it aired on TV. I noticed that there were some episodes missing so I looked up the series schedule in the internet and found that I am missing all of season 5 even though they shipped me a season 5. Turns out that some of the episodes from season 2 are actually on the discs for season 3 and the episodes for season 3 are in season 4 and season 4 shows are on season 5 labelled discs. In total I am missing 13 episodes including the season finale.,1379894400,,471,4.0212765957446805
5567367,2,B00BAXTY6M,Misleading and very disappointing to not have the complete series.  Season 5 is missing.  Wondering why Amazon continues to let it be on the site.,1379721600,,146,4.8
5567368,3,B00BAXTY6M,"This series was originally a Canadian show.  Apparently the US chose to air it only after the fifth season was over.
It was a very short lived program, series, whatever.  But, this show has got to be, hands down the BEST show EVER!!!
The actors; awesome.  They pulled you into their lives and into the drama of the SUB.  They let you ""feel"".  It is not just  something to watch on T.V.,  it is great entertainment.
So, as you could imagine to my horror, 3 of the 5 disc set were un-watchable.  They froze up so bad I though my new TV was going to blow.  Not happy with this and why are you sending crap to folks at all????",1379548800,,622,4.116666666666666
5567369,5,B00BAXTY6M,"I would recommend this product to anyone.

5567371,2,B00BAXTY6M,"The missing episodes made getting this a moot point.  I already have most of the episodes on DVD. Some of the episodes aren't even in the correct order.  Makes watching this series a little challenging. Was wondering since this is a Canadian series, maybe the DVDs are in order according to how CBS aired them?",1377648000,8,310,4.618181818181818
5567372,3,B00BAXTY6M,"No problems with the seller but the product itself. It said Flashpoint seasons 1 thru 5, however the seasons 1 thru 4 were broken up into what made it look like all 5 seasons. The seller did look into it to correct it but the product is all that the supplier supplied. Once again the seller was great about it but just very disappointed that not even 1 episode of season 5 was on it.",1376697600,4,383,4.12

5567375,3,B00BAXTY6M,Love the show but i had to give it 3 stars.  I was disappointed to find out that I was actually only getting 62 out of the 75 episodes.  I hope they release the last 13 episodes soon.,1374710400,9,183,3.789473684210526
