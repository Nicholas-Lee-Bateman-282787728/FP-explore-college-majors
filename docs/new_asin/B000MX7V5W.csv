2751187,5,B000MX7V5W,"I am plaesed, as always, with the service and quality of Amazon and am very satisfied with the 9th season of the Frasier Show. The Frasier Show is always a delight and ceaselessly produces good quality laughter, always tastefully done and causing more then a chuckle!",1181260800,,267,4.826086956521739
2751188,4,B000MX7V5W,"Really liked this DVD, especially the development of Niles' character from love sick puppy pre-Daphne Moon to even more love sick puppy with Daphne Moon. Very few shows can carry on once the love interest has moved to full blown love-mania. But with a stellar ensemble cast and strong plot iterations produced over a 22 minute period there was never an issue of settling the characters into a state of connubial bliss.

I can't wait till season 10!!",1181174400,,449,4.756410256410256
2751189,5,B000MX7V5W,"Indeed, it took a while between season 8 was made available on DVD and season ), but it was really worth the wait. I still think season 8 was quite good and this even improves on it. To some degree, the comedy appeal of it has improved while reatining the quality of the series. This season contains some real gems like Frasier saydreaming about his wives and Roz falling in love with a garbage-man. The whole cast is as usual in very fine form and overall this is an excellent value for the price you pay. There has even ben a slight improvement in the overall presentation of the programme in my opinion compared to the older DVD's.",1180310400,,634,4.38135593220339
2751190,4,B000MX7V5W,"Following the erratic Season 8, Frasier bounded back strongly with a solid run of fine episodes for this, the 9th season of this great series. While not up to the prime days, this season still has some funny moments & fine performances.

We begin with ""Don Juan in Hell"", featuring Lilith, Diane, Nannie G, & the return of Rita Wilson as Frasier's mother.  Despite the talent and interesting premise, the episode does languish at times.
But ""Room Full of Heroes"" is a real winner and all the cast looking like they had a great time making it with Niles dressing up as Martin being the highlight.  Disc 2 features ""Bla-Z-Boy"" with the great visual of Martin and Daphne walking down the sidewalk only to have a certain beloved item drop from the sky.  Adam Arkin is Frasier's Number One fan in ""The Two Hundredth Episode"" and we have the welcome return of Bebe in ""Junior Agent"".

Frasier also gets an arch ""enemy"" in the form of Cam Winston (now there's a name) in the two part ""Mother Load"" which also brings back the wonderful Anthony LaPaglia as Daphne's wayward brother Simon. Disc 3 features a nice turn by Michael Keaton in ""Wheels of Fortune"", though his identity as Lilith's half brother seems rather half baked. Sadly, ""War of the Words"" may be one of, if not the worst episode in the entire history of ""Frasier"".

Disc 4 brings back some of the ""Cheers"" gang in ""Cheerful Goodbyes"" as the Crane clan return to Boston just in time for Cliff's retirement party. The final two episodes introduce us to Daphne's father played with much aplomb by Brian Cox. And while Daphne's parents have apparently parted ways for the final time, the episode ends with Daphne demanding the Niles marry her right now.

Like previous seasons, this DVD has no extras but you can skip the previews and go straight to the main menu. The DVD case cover uses a rather odd purple color which is also seen on the menu screens. We get the usual official photos of the cast and the one of Roz on the Disc 2 menu screen is rather nice.

This is another okay, but not exceptional effort on the part of CBS Video.  Where oh where are the extras or the bloopers? Even an extra menu screen showing the nominations and awards would've been nice.

Tidbits:

- Moose makes his return to the DVD spine in this edition.  So far, only Eddie `n Frasier's picture have been on the spine of the DVD case.

- In a flashback sequence for ""The Return of Martin Crane"" we get to see Marty walk without a cane.

-  One of the best character entries has to be Niles riding in on a Segway (it's even a photo on the DVD case).  Interestingly enough, he wears a hat very similar to one he wore in the Fifth Season's ""Bad Dog"".  In that episode, Frasier chides him about his choice of hats.

- You probably know this, but in ""Cheerful Goodbyes"" the older gentleman playing Phil (not ""Al"" as he proclaims) is actually Rhea Pearlman's father.

- When Daphne greets her father, he calls her ""Stilts"". The same nickname Simon called her back in Season 7.",1179619200,,3005,4.480733944954128
2751191,5,B000MX7V5W,"Has anyone else noticed that the packaging says ""The Ninth Season"" and not ""The Complete Ninth Season"".  Is anything missing?  Are these the syndicated versions?",1179273600,2,161,5.4

As for myself, I have long anticipated this release and I look forward to its arrival on my doorstep. Sit back, Frasier fans, turn on your DVD player, and pop the CD in.

In any case I'll be watching it immediately, what happens with Lana? Oh and where's Series Ten?",1175817600,4,288,3.9827586206896552
2751195,5,B000MX7V5W,"Frasier is one of the all time great shows. Season 9 is one of the better seasons of this eleven seasons series.

During this season, Frasier, on a getaway at a rustic cabin, has a hallucination of his three previous girlfriends/wives. He also manages to accidentally destroy the arm chair of Martin. The reconstructed arm chair ironically is the most expensive item in his exquisitely assembled drawing room - oh the irony! Niles and Daphne plans to move in together and their plans are thwarted by the arrival of Daphne's mother. Frasier tries to un-mask Lilith's (his ex-wife) brother, a con-artist. In one memorable episode, Cliff's (a character from Cheers) farewell party introduces Niles to Frasier's past exploits at Cheers. During the season finale, Roz and Frasier sleep together, forever immortalized by the comment from Martin (""Big story about how Roz's purse spent the night on the coffee table""). And Niles is off to England to try and convince the alcoholic father of Daphne to reunite with his family.

A strongly recommended season and those of you not familiar with the characters, I have added a small summary of the main characters of the show.

Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer): The lead character. He holds degrees in psychology from Harvard University and lives in Seattle. His list of selective hobbies include playing the piano, attending the opera and expensive charity events, collecting expensive art and participating in wine tasting events. Of course his main past time is unsuccessfully trying to curb his competitive nature - especially when it comes to his brother Niles.

Niles Crane (David Hyde Pierce): The undoubted star of the show IMHO. Frasier's brother and practicing psychiatrist. Niles shares similar interests and educational background to Frasier (he was however educated at Yale University) and is probably even more finicky than his brother. Niles has an aversion to bugs and has several weird characteristics (extreme ethical standards, strong food allergies, dusting the chair before sitting and so on).

Martin Crane (John Mahoney): Frasier and Niles' father. He was in the police force for long until he was shot in the hip during an armed robbery. Martin moves in with Frasier (bringing his dog and a battered armchair into the life of Frasier and Daphne into the life of Niles). Martin's no-nonsense attitude and straightforward outlook on life often lead to confrontations with Frasier and Niles, who aspire to greater levels of sophistication.

Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves): An immigrant from Manchester, England. Daphne was hired by Frasier to be Martin's physiotherapist. Daphne often relates bizarre tales involving her family.

Roz Doyle (Peri Gilpin): Roz is the producer of Frasier's radio show. Roz is known for her relaxed attitude (especially when it comes to men) and quick-witted remarks, and enjoys deflating Frasier's ego - a favor often reciprocated by Frasier.

Any way the episodes for season 9 are:

Episode 1: Don Juan in Hell: Part 1
Episode 2: Don Juan in Hell: Part 2
Episode 3: The First Temptation of Daphne
Episode 4: The Return of Martin Crane
Episode 5: Love Stinks
Episode 6: Room Full of Heroes
Episode 7: Bla-Z-Boy
Episode 8: The Two Hundredth
Episode 9: Sharing Kirby
Episode 10: Junior Agent
Episode 11: Bully for Martin
Episode 12: Mother Load: Part 1
Episode 13: Mother Load: Part 2
Episode 14: Juvenilia
Episode 15: The Proposal
Episode 16: Wheels of Fortune
Episode 17: Three Blind Dates
Episode 18: War of the Words
Episode 19: Deathtrap
Episode 20: The Love You Fake
Episode 21: Cheerful Goodbyes
Episode 22: Frasier Has Spokane
Episode 23: The Guilt Trippers
Episode 24: Moons Over Seattle

Enjoy!",1170374400,78,3686,5.107973421926911
2751196,3,B000MX7V5W,"Season 9 of Frasier saw Dan O'Shannon become the sole `Showrunner' following Mark Reisman's departure from the staff, and it could hardly have been in more tragic circumstances. David Angell, the co-creator of the show and a major creative force died, as so many did, in the September 11th atrocities of 2001. It's difficult to assess how this tragedy affected the show creatively, as the series was already in a period of re-adjustment following the Season 7 finale and the whole dynamic of the show had changed. Taken as a whole, the season is a marginal improvement on the more serious and thoughtful season 8. There are a greater number of funny episodes, but the poor episodes really stand out. Here's a rundown of the season:

Don Juan In Hell Part 1 - A continuation of the season 8 finale in which Frasier has to choose between two women, Claire and Lana. On the whole it's a pretty dull re-tread, with only the appearance of `Island Niles' providing some mild amusement.

Don Juan In Hell Part 2 - Likely to be combined with the first part on DVD, this is a much better episode. Frasier forces himself to confront the reason why his relationships always fail by inviting Lilith, Diane, Nanette (his first wife) and Hester (his mother) on a trip inside his head.

The First Temptation of Daphne - Daphne and Niles address issues of trust following Daphne's discovery that one of Niles' patients is infatuated with him.

The Return of Martin Crane - A thoughtful episode in which Martin returns to work for the first time since he was shot many years ago.

Love Stinks - The first truly bad episode this season revolves around Roz being embarrassed dating a garbage disposal worker. It's a shame Peri Gilpin was given such weak material for a rare Roz-centred episode, most of the dialogue is cringing.

Room Full Of Heroes - A Halloween outing which, while not being particularly high brow, is fun throughout nonetheless. The only downside is a heavy handed scene towards the end

Bla-Z-Boy - Jon Sherman wrote many of my favourite episodes in Frasier's later seasons, and he delivers in spades here with the best of the season. Frasier becomes irked by the fact that he has lived with his father for longer than any relationship he's ever had with a woman. Both feel the other resents them, and this comes hilariously to the fore as Frasier accidentally but utterly destroys Martin's beloved chair. The dialogue and pace of the episode is reminiscent of the early classic years, and remains just as funny on repeated viewing. A truly classic episode.

The Two Hundredth - This milestone in the show's history is marked by an underwhelming episode in which Frasier meets his `ultimate fan'.

Sharing Kirby -This episode involves Niles and Frasier sparring for Kirby's favour, and is a fun, above average episode.

Junior Agent - Harriet Sansom Harris, who plays Frasier's conniving agent Bebe Glazer is a source of constant joy throughout the series. Sadly, this is possibly the weakest of her episodes.

Bully For Martin - As the title suggests, this episode centres on Martin's struggle with his bully of a boss.

Mother Load Part 1 - This highly entertaining episode sees the introduction of oft-referred-to Frasier nemesis Cam Winston.

Mother Load Part 2 - A slight letdown following the excellent first part, this is nonetheless an amusing episode. The sight of Daphne standing up to her mother was a joy.

Juvenilia - The final outing for Kirby sees him become an unlikely mentor for Frasier as he tackles the tenacious `Teen Scene' gang at KACL.

The Proposal - The episode in which Niles finally proposes to Daphne contains all the farce and humour for which the show is best known.

Wheels of Fortune - Scripted by veteran `Cheers' writers Ken Levine & David Isaacs, this feels like a departure from the standard `Frasier' template, and features a star turn from Michael Keaton as Lilith's wheelchair bound half-brother Blaine.

Three Blind Dates - Another great episode split, as the title suggests, into three distinct parts. The middle section is particularly funny.

War of the Words - Following three near-classic episodes on the spin, we're brought crashing back down to earth with this absolute stinker. Most definitely the worst episode in the history of `Frasier'.

Deathtrap - A murder/mystery plot is at the heart of this rare Frasier/Niles centred episode. The sight of David Hyde Pierce and Kelsey Grammar sparring off each other is a real treat.

The Love You Fake - The second and final outing for Cam Winston produces another rather fun episode.

Cheerful Goodbyes - This unnecessary episode feels like little more than an excuse to crowbar all the remaining members of the former `Cheers' cast into an episode of `Frasier' .

Frasier Has Spokane -Frasier expands his listener base in this below par episode, the only highlight of which is the scene where Frasier is introduced to the hostile Spokane media.

The Guilt Trippers - This episode takes the Frasier/Roz relationship somewhere it should never have gone - into the bedroom.

Moons Over Seattle - An up and down season is thankfully concluded with a highly enjoyable finale. Brian Cox is enlisted as Daphne's roguish father, and his star turn has one wondering why this was his only appearance on the show. A funny, witty episode which ends on a romantic cliffhanger is a welcome conclusion to an uneven season.

In conclusion then, this is a bi-polar season of Frasier, with at least half the episodes providing great entertainment and the other half making one grateful for the `skip' facility the DVD format provides. Having said that even the casual fan will be richly entertained by many of the episodes found here. It would be nice if Paramount included some extras this time. A tasteful tribute to David and Lynn Angell and the inclusion of NBC's 200th episode special would not go amiss, but sadly if past form is anything to judge by we won't get a thing.",1170288000,90,5957,4.839566929133858

2751565,5,B000MX7V5W,"I've always loved the last few seasons of Frasier the best after Niles and Daphne get together. It was so great to see Niles finally step out of his brother's shadow and reach out for what he wanted for so long.  They never made it easy for these two and didn't let Niles' change be too drastic.  It is easy to see that his old self is in constant battle with what he is trying to become.  He is always loveable and is, and has always been, the very best thing on this show.  What a brilliant actor he is.  His farce scenes are always falling down funny.  Such a wonderful comedian.",1388188800,,582,4.151785714285714

If you're a Frasier fan and can't afford a package of the whole series at once, do as I did, buy one season at a time as your budget allows. The characters from Season 6 on were not as comical though.  The comedy was in Season 1 through Season 6.  After the loss of David Angell on 911 definitely effected the characters, writers, etc.  It became a very angry show.

The episodes seemed to lack the comedic timing, and the plots just were not as clever and witty as the previous 8 years.  The death of David Angell, due to the tragedy of September 1lth, may have been a clear reason why the show just was not the same.

2751655,4,B000MX7V5W,"Some people talk about the dip in quality of Frasier in some of the latter seasons, and while it's true that some of the episodes were a little less fresh in season 9, it's hard to complain about a show that overall is so great. Some of the episodes in this season seemed a little clunky or forced like the one where Frasier is haunted by his ex-wives' memories or the one where he attends a retirement party for Cliff of Cheers. However, there are some really good episodes too. I think part of the issue the show faced in seasons 8 and 9 was the partial resolution of the Daphne-Niles relationship and how that affected the story lines. However, the final scene of the final episode is a highly emotional and effective hook based on these two characters that makes you want to rush out and buy season 10. All in all, if you are a fan of Frasier, you will enjoy watching this season.",1282262400,6,884,4.331325301204819
2751656,5,B000MX7V5W,"Since season eight there has been a different direction to the series that steers away from its initial formula; it keeps digging deeper into psychiatry, the personal psychology and relationships of the characters. Season nine literally starts off where season eight left off with a two-part episode where he battles with his affections for Claire and his lust for Lana. And in a following episode, all his ex-wives, fiancs and his Mother come to nest in his confused mind and try to answer the old-age Frasier question; why can't he hold a relationship with a woman? When Frasier tries to escape the self- inflicted analysis which he has manifested; he opens a door to escape and all the women from his past are waiting for him on the other side...yikes!!!

In this classic season Roz finally starts dating the real thing after meeting Roger played by the charming and talented Tony Goldwyn whom Frasier describes as `a combination of gentility and brute strength'. In this relationship Roz learns to deal with her prejudices; you see Roger works for the city collecting garbage and that stinks according to her.

Lana's son Kirby is still part of the scene and appears in a few episodes; watch Kirby organize Niles' library with cheese puffs on one hand and a soft drink on the other. Meanwhile Martin and Frasier are dealing with old demons as opposed to Daphne and Roz who are dealing with new demons as well as old ones; Daphne becomes jealous of a female patient being treated by Niles when she accidentally reads a confidential file and makes things worse when she spies on the woman; you've never seen Niles this upset with Daphne and you've never seen Daphne more disoriented than during her Mother and brother's visit; her Mother's comment to her brother `it's you who'll have your leg over any filth that moves' with his response `I don't care if they're moving'; is comedy heaven and her Mother's constant insults when she decides to roost in Seattle followed by Daphne giving her a piece of her mind is inspired while Simon's crude behaviour upset the Crane household in `Mother Load', topped off with Frasier throwing Simon out on the street with luggage intact!

SPOILERS AHEAD!
The icing on the cake is `The Proposal' which digs into the Crane's dirty laundry while Niles is preparing an engagement party for his proposal to Daphne; the scene where the three Cranes help Niles buy the ring ends up with Frasier on his knees, Niles wearing the ring and Martin shaking his head as he shuffles out of the jewellers. That scene is soon followed by a narrow emergency escape of musicians, chefs, waiters and angels from Niles home when the party has to be cancelled; which puts a new spin on TV comedy!

The character is one of the most original on television and that's why it's been a successful series; watching this tormented man who needs to control everything, fall to pieces `like scrambled eggs, all over the place' in every episode has been a fun albeit frustrating ride; gee it almost resembles parts of my life...been there, done that!

Bibi shows up for a short stint and only one scene with a new and very handsome client, Doctor Zach played by Chris Berg; who is becoming fierce competition for Frasier's radio show. Frasier gets all hot and bothered but not as hot and bothered when an insistent and persistent agent corners him and Kenny in the locker room of his club, with fire in her eyes and a few squats to convince him that she can take his career to the next level. Frasier inherits a new fiery agent and Doctor Zach loses his pants; literally!

Bulldog only shows up later in the season for standard fare and a short scene. The supporting cast are generally absent; even Eddie, Martin's dog has fewer scenes except in the episode `Juvenilia' where he gets to shine in an inspired scene with Niles!

A few highlights are; `Frasier Has Spokane' where Frasier tries to host in a hostile city and Daphne becomes a carpenter for a day while Niles tries to be her submissive aid and Martin takes a back seat to her skills, `The Guilt Trippers' where Frasier sleeps with Roz, flies to Wisconsin and entertains Roz's family also `Moons Over Seattle' where Niles having flown to Britain puts up being manhandled so he can convince Daphne's father played by Brian Cox to join him for a family reunion which ends up with a dog jumping Niles leg, a fire in the middle of St. Henri, Frasier getting ousted out of his favourite restaurant and Daphne's touching declaration of love! This season also boasts the return of most of the Cheers cast in `Cheerful Goodbyes' it is painful for me to watch my favourite characters age; I always loved their energy and comic timing.

In the final analysis this season is one for the archives; one of the best in the series!",1281225600,,4783,4.685714285714286

2751681,5,B000MX7V5W,"The ""Frasier"" series is a classic.  Every episode is excellent!  It's the new ""I Love Lucy"" in that each episode is my favorite, and it's hard to decide which one is the best.",1184198400,,175,4.2727272727272725

The DVD collection is great, the packaging ""primo"", and overall this my favourite TV sitcom of all time. Very funny and interesting season as well, if you love Frasier don't let this one go, it's worth every penny.",1182816000,,319,4.333333333333333

2751687,5,B000MX7V5W,"I was first introduced to Frasier when Lifetime started airing the shows.  Since then, I have been hooked and wanted to get the seasons to see the shows that I had missed, watch them in order, and to also be able to watch Frasier whenever I wanted!  I also got my husband addicted to the show as well, so we now have all the seasons, except for 10, which we are anxiously awaiting its arrival!  This show is hilarious, witty, and a pure enjoyment to watch!  The Frasier seasons are a priceless, MUST HAVE addition to any DVD collection!",1181606400,,536,4.383838383838384
2751688,5,B000MX7V5W,"Everyone in my home enjoys Frasier from my husband and I, to our two children (15 & 18).  We all enjoyed the ninth season and love the ending with Daphne demanding that Niles marry her ""right now"".  Of course, everyone feels sorry for Frasier with his short-term relationships that never amount to anything - but we seem to watch for Niles and Daphne story line anyway!!  Wouldn't it be nice if Niles & Daphne began their own show - after all Frasier is a continuation from Cheers - why not have a continuation of Niles & Daphen from the Fraiser series!!  Meanwhile - this family will be anxiously awaiting the (I'm afraid to say) long wait for the 10th season to finish of our favorite collection!!",1181520000,,699,4.523809523809524
