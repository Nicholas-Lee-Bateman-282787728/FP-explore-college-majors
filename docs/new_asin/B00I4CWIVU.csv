6250172,1,B00I4CWIVU,"Having done some scholarly and actual research on the leather scene as well as the the ravages of AIDS in the gay community, I have wallowed in subject matter pertaining to this topic and yet I have to say that this documentary left me sorely disappointed. The question is:  Why was it even filmed at all? As others reviewers have stated, the film centers around the main actor whose dilemma is as easy  to solve as to simply say that he does not want to reprise the role that Al Pacino took in ""Crusing."" He's worried that taking it may affect his future acting career. In reality, the film has not much to do with where 'Cruising' left off. Nor does it have much to do with recreating the 40 minutes that were edited out from 'Cruising.' This was more of a 'making of' and the unnecessary drama and decisions that an unknown actor has to make when offered a role like this. Will he be typecasted in gay roles for the rest of is career? Is that even a problem in this era of acceptance?  Overall, you get a total of approximately 5 minutes of recreated footage of oral sex on a flaccid penis, unattractive men, use of poppers,  and strange awkward  dancing by the lead actor. This film was made in Los Angeles where you still have a few remaining leather bars, for example in  Silver Lake (The Eagle, Faultline) where if any effort had been made at all, the film could had been filmed there for some authenticity. A lot of porn films have been filmed at these bars. I'm sure the crew couldn't have had any problems in doing so. 'Cruising' was filmed in real bars with real patrons and 'Interior. Leather Bar' doesn't even come close that. It is a true wasted opportunity and watching it is a waste of time. I guess we'll never know what the lost 40 minutes of cruising really contained. I have to add that the intro to ILB mentions that the edited footage has never been shown to audiences as if it is archived somewhere in some vaults. In reality, the footage is believed to have been discarded and hence no longer exist. They couldn't even get that fact right. Sorry Mr. Franco, but  I recommend to  your fans passing on this.",1395014400,11,2129,4.399491094147582
6250173,1,B00I4CWIVU,"Running less than an hour, this  film is supposed  to  be  about what may have been cut from the film CRUISING .Does anyone  really care.? The film goes nowhere and is  merely a documentary about  what that footage  may have consisted of. The actual  footage lasts  only a few minutes  as against the  alleged  40 missing  minutes from the film.  The film is mostly talk and more talk about the setting up of the bar  scene and by the time they actually start filming, it is over.  Wasn't it supposed to  be about the 40 missing  minutes of  gay sex.?Don't  expect  much action in this  overrated  and very boring film. Just why did  James Franco  get involved  as the producer of this film? It pushes his career downhill.

6250175,2,B00I4CWIVU,"James Franco proves a terrible friend to his straight, married acting buddy as Franco uses the pretense of re-enacting cut footage from Cruising - without either the script or an idea of what the footage actually contained - to stage racy gay sex that he argues is only offensive because we exist in a heteronormative culture that demonizes sex and celebrates violence.

The run time is an hour. The actual director is very amusing with his instructions to actors. Some of the men are rather handsome. And the lead guy is stuck, afraid that this project will destroy his career.

Most people are mistaken.

This is a scripted drama, in the form of a documentary. There are subtle clues in the film (such as shots showing the actual script, with dialogue).

Don't waste your money.  Instead go buy the delightful documentary ""BEEFCAKE"", the story of photographer Bob Mizer and his AMG/Athletic Model Guild company.  This ""INTERIOR. LEATHER BAR."" dvd is a major disappointment on so many levels.  All this really is, is a one hour trailer for a non-existent film on the missing 40 minutes.  For one hour you have to sit through numerous complaints by James Franco and the ""cast"" about how they don't know what they are doing, they don't know the point of this, they don't know why they are involved, etc.  They mention several times that there is no script and not once ask why.  If you like wasting money watching a group of confused people with a camera pretend to shoot a backroom porn, then hell go to any porn store and buy a $5 no-name porn company dvd for that.  Attaching James Franco's name to this ""project"" was so they could sell it for more than $5.  I was fooled into thinking after an hour of senseless crap they were then going to show 40 minutes of the recreated missing scene.  But no.  That's was it.  During the 1 hour you get just 30 seconds here and there of snippits of what is just rehearsals for scenes that are never actually filmed.  So what was the point?  There wasn't any.

There is much discussion from different parties involved with the production regarding why the film was being made and what it meant. When all was said and done, for me, it meant nothing and the reason it was made was to TRY to push boundaries and buttons. Yet, for me, my boundaries and buttons didn't budge. Glad I saw it, because it has been controversial; but, after seeing it, I don't know why it has been so controversial.

Most of this is a documentary style of choosing the cast. Val Lauren is taking the Al Pacino role and he is a straight man. he is definitely not comfortable with the subject matter or the showing of the male anatomy or his fellow actors. Mr. Franco is a man who is sooo in touch with every side of himself which makes him so very endearing. he tries to explain to Val why and Val just doesn't get it but he believes in James so he is there to do it. There are some sex scenes that are pretty graphic for some of the masses. They are fast but there. This is a world of s& m and bondage so it isn't pretty by any means.

If you pay more than 5 bucks, you got ripped off. There is no plot or a story to tell and you expect documentaries to have a goal or story to tell.

When Val and James are having a conversation in private about James' point in making the project, I think that is an excellent take away. James is angry that he's been socially conditioned to feel a certain way.

6250213,4,B00I4CWIVU,"What I like about this film is the questions that come to light about sex, sexuality and what is construed as appropriate viewing material. Franco states in the film that it bothers him that his mind has been manipulated by society and his own upbringing forcing him to carry this generic view of what is ""normal' and what is ""abnormal"".  It pisses him off that he is shocked and put off by male/male sexuality. The question is: why was the 40minutes cut from the film ""Cruising""? Were these scenes cut because they were sexual? If so why? Sex is apart of everyone's life in some way.  People are having sex, and having sexual relationships and having children and choosing to have sex without having children. People are not having sex perhaps because of religious stigmas and beliefs so what is the problem with sex in the film Cruising? The next question is: were the scenes cut because it was gay sex? If so why? Homosexuality exists, there are men in the world having sex with eachother and if gaysex is inappropriate and if we are concerned with appropriatness then why is there such explicit violence shown in films? (Franco's point) I love the depth that this film goes into with those questions and to some extent the questions are answered. People are afraid to step out into the REAL WORLD and see that everything is not clean, simple, male/female, etc etc. Why are people afraid? Notice how the lead actor was so uncomfortable with the sexuality. He is on the phone with his ""friend"" who calls the project ""Franco Faggot Movie"". I found that to speak volumes and BRAVO to Franco for getting that out there. Futher the lead actor's girlfriend says: ""Do I have to get a strap-on..."" I thought the film was brilliant. It was not what I expected, but I am pleased with what I got. The discussions that the heterosexual actors were having and their need to declare their sexual orientation was very interesting.  I wonder if this film really was about the cut scenes from ""Cruising"" or if Franco was delivering something much more complex and indepth about Society.",1410998400,2,2072,4.686813186813187

What the producers attempted to do is quite lost in its resolution. Those 40 minutes may have been segments, bits and pieces, that Friedkin left out to secure an ""R"" ratings.

Franco and Mathews decided it was all porn stuff, and created a documentary about, well, porn.

Its okay to show someone's head blown off or a throat sliced open in explicit detail but when it comes to sex it is all hidden and objectified in a shameful way. Especially with films like ""Cruising"" where it was more then a cop going underground to find a killer, but a piece that was exploring a world that, whether you want to admit it or not, exists and has a place in society.

6250234,2,B00I4CWIVU,"Let's be real: the only reason most of us watched this, or had any interest in it whatsoever, is because James Franco was in it.
So, I'll give this a cursory review from two perspectives - 1) If it is worth watching it just for Franco, and 2) If it is worth watching on its own merits.

1) NO.  It is not worth watching just for Franco, unless you are seriously a diehard James Franco fan.  You see him behind the camera a few times, and sitting around BS-ing with the other crew, but that is all.  If you watch this hoping to see more of Franco, you are going to be disappointed.
2) NO.  It is not worth watching on its own merits.  It seems to be about some scaredy-cat straight guy who is a struggling actor in Hollywood and takes this role despite the objections of his friends/family/agent/whoever.

It'll help you to know this is a mocumentary; a movie within a movie of sorts that breaks the fourth wall in innovative ways. For me it sets but denies expectations by pretending to be something it's not. When it exposes itself  as a ruse the point is nullified. Starting as if a documentary about filming a vision of the scenes deleted from the 1980 film Cruising, I expected the process of recreating the scenes and the final vision rendered. Cruising was a bad Hollywood film from 1980 starring Al Pacino; I didn't go in expecting a titillating experience. I maybe expected some message about ignorance, how far we've come with comparisons using dated standards, something along those lines. But, the film seemed to be exploiting its focus on actors thrown together at the last minute who are about to film gay sex and we were going to watch. I was a bit baffled by that. However, as the film slowly progresses, focus continues on the actors, mostly the lead who is uncomfortable about the project. So, I switch gears thinking I'm watching a doc about the reactions of actors about to make these scenes, an expose on mens' attitudes about gay sex, or unconventional sexuality, or a statement piece about sex as art or the fear of sex in the modern age. (The film focuses solely on the male actors. Attitudes of the crew where the women are don't exist.) The ruse was exposed to me, when on camera, an actor is directed what to say during what was first depicted as a not so interesting candid conversation.  In the final act, when the 4th wall is shattered by the lead reading the script, which is describing what he is doing at that moment while taking a break from the set, I also heard, ""everything you've just seen was scripted. This is a narrative drama message piece. So, ha HA, just kidding."" The emotional propulsion and the message, slow and superficial as it is, is undone.
 There are a few short mock scenes from Cruising put together that are so inauthentic they destabilize the foundation the film is built on. Whether there's something that advances anything in this, I can not tell you. Straight people are uncomfortable with gay sex? Uhm, well yeah. Most everyone is uncomfortable engaging in intimacy of a sort to which they are not inclined. So, that can't be it; can it?  Really, a lot that the movie demonstrates is one big Duh! There is stigma about sex and alternative sexuality. But the film doesn't forward the argument in the way it portends; and frankly it's boring.

Interior talks a lot about gay storytelling and sex in an era where being gay is becoming mainstream.  In what used to be blacked out bars is now open to the air, to the scrutiny of everyone.

Through striking visuals and behind-the-scenes insight, the film questions why sex is shunned in movies.  Is there something in ourselves we are afraid to confront?  This is what Val, the main character confronts.  If we all watch porn, talk about sex, interested in sex and largely motivated by it, why can't it be used openly as a storytelling tool?

James Franco uses his celebrity to bring awareness to sex and queer stories.  At the same time James explores his own feelings on sexuality.  What it means to be a straight man in an ever changing world?  He teamed up with director Travis Mathews, the director behind I Want Your Love.

Franco took the character from the film and turned it into a real character, the straight lead actor that resembled a younger Al Pacino that was uncomfortable with what he saw on the set. The lead definitely struggled with being a straight man in a gay film as Al Pacino's character dealt with being a straight man in a gay underworld.

8639198,4,B00I4CWIVU,"This is a different kind of film.  I understand that James Franco is wanting to defend the rights of Men/Homosexuals.  I know his heart is in the right place.  But in this case I am not sure if he is trying to defend the rights of gay people or make a Pornographic movie.  I do agree that the Male and Female bodies are beautiful.  You should be able to show the men in all their glory just like you do women.  Just because men have extra baggage in their private area, does not make it disgusting.  Furthermore, if size does not matter when it comes to women's titties, why should it matter with a mans penis.",1483142400,3,610,4.206896551724138
