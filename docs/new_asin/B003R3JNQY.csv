4176260,1,B003R3JNQY,"I intended to collect the whole series as it came out.  But with this release they are too greedy, and I cancel that plan.  Season 6 has 22 episodes, yet this box has only 12 episodes in it.  With 15 seasons they could have made a fair amount of money, but they chose to kill the golden goose by trying to double the number of box sets.

They can try again without being so greedy.  Perhaps all 283 episodes in one box for $100 would make up for the travesty of box 6.",1278633600,4,468,3.989247311827957
4176261,1,B003R3JNQY,"I love bleach, I love it so incredibly much I have been buying the box sets as they come out even though I can watch them online. However, this is just horrendous. Bleach season 6 has 22 episodes, NOT 12. So what they are going to do yet again (just like they did in season 4) is split the season into 2 parts in order to make more money. Its atrocious and I couldn't be more angry about it. This part of season 6 will only have 12 episodes, the next part will have another 10. Its awful and I can't believe they are doing it yet again. Season 4 of Bleach titled The Bount had 27 episodes and they split those up into 2 sets each which cost [...] bucks at the time. The Bount one, kinda partially made sense but still angered me, but this Season 6 one I simply won't buy. [...] bucks for 12 episodes? I think not.",1278028800,161,813,4.0246913580246915

The plastic of the case has 2 damaged spots that you can see when you look straight at the case but the ouside box looks better then other 3 that I ordered new along with this and this was the least damaged case and atleast this disc set didn't have scratches like they did on box set 8 on the first disc. Ordered 4 new and the ones I ordered came in a box that fits 2 and a bubble wrap package that you usually get. This one happened to be in the bubble wrap package and was the least damaged of the 3 which is why I still give 5 stars, because the other 3 being so damaged on outside for being new.

Good story lines in Set 6 and 7 before it degenerates into just Ichigo getting beat up and the usual sword fighting, it is to see the diferent styles of the soul reapers, and the levels of fighting they have.
I enjoy watching Bleach love the characters, but as Isaid before it is a bit freaky to hear the actors voices from Naruto coming out of Bleach's character's mouth. It soon becomes a game of guess that character voice.
The actress who voices Sakura voices most of the females in this series, and voices one of Ichigo's sisters as well. What was most disturbing/interesting was to hear Jiriya's (sic I think) voice coming out of Kenpaci's mouth.",1376611200,,827,4.594594594594595

Ok boy can see ghosts, some ghosts eat other ghosts so there r other ghosts that stop the bad ghosts from eating the good ones, boy meets girl good ghost that gives him the power to become like her so that he can fight the bad ghosts.
I know that the bad ghosts r call something and r a little different than just ghosts and that the ones I'm calling good ghosts r called something else also.
I'm just trying to make it simple here ok. ^_^
I really do love this anime just don't want to go into great detail on what is what when someone just wants to know the basics of what they maybe buying even though if ur looking for a anime u most likely already know what ur looking for or buying if ur here.

It's a great instalment into the series, but the only thing I was dissapointed in is the fact that with season 1 and the two part season 2 each box set had almost 20 episodes each but this set only has 12.

4176350,1,B003R3JNQY,"After season 5 These new ""dvd"" sets were put in. Though the packaging was fine, they actually look more neat on a shelf than the other ones do.(Since these are all one uniform color and format). But then they change the colors back to random with dvd sets 11-15. Though my problem with those is the quality just doesn't add up when those releases definitely have an option for blu-ray, but that isn't my problem with these.

These new dvd sets 6-10 have taken away one disc from each new release which had only happened when box 4 was split into two parts. These sets have 12 episodes each until you get to set 9 where it drops down to a measly 11 episodes each. The only way this could be worse is if it was back in the vhs/dvd days where they only released singles(with three episodes) and that got trashed.

This series is 350+ episodes long and may become even longer. The only reasonable thing to do it wait for the series to end and they come out with a box set like any completed series does(Dragon Ball Z, even movies like Harry Potter). So until then I almost urge buyers to wait off until another a new release of the series comes out. Having almost 30 box sets if they finish at this pace would be pretty absurd.",1359331200,,1223,4.29004329004329

4176354,1,B003R3JNQY,"This is a review of the box set quality, not the episodes.  As of the end of 2012, I have bought all the Bleach Box Sets and this is easily the worse.  The sleeve and dvd case are decent (it gets worse around set 11 or 10).  However the dvds within the set are the same as the discs in the individual dvds, they were too cheep to remake the discs (I noticed this a few weeks back when I was moving all my discs into a binder).  The amount of episodes from this point on are around 11-13 episodes a set.  There are basically no special features other then a textless opener and textless closing.  When its all said and done, I could not recommend this set to anyone unless you are a huge fan of the series like me.  Even then I would have a hard time recommending it to anyone.

If you are new to the series and do not have any of the box sets, I highly recommend seasons 1-3 (however stop after that).  All the issues I have had with the box sets lately, I never had with the first three, they are great quality and have the best episodes.",1356652800,,1039,4.029268292682927

I am slowly buying all the box sets but the splitting of season 6 is worse than the season 4 split. at least i was able to buy both parts of season 4 at the same time, but ive yet to see the second half of season 6 for say anywhere. season 7 seems to be sold whole but i don't want to buy it until i can get the complete season 6. if anyone knows where i can get it please email me at howitzerhunter@yahoo.com subject bleach. ive looked at the viz site and funimation but i haven't found it. thank you for any help in finding it",1351728000,,621,3.7480916030534353

Fortunately Captain Hitsugaya has a party of high ranking soul reapers at his command, and they are ready to protect Karakura Town.

4176358,5,B003R3JNQY,"First off, reviews are to review the product not complain about the price or company being money hungry, the fact I hear this a lot reading these is why I have decided to write review for these items.

This is a continuation of a great anime series, weather it be following the manga or a filler (anime only) arc, I highly recommend watching it. It is one of the longest run series out there, in manga, on TV as well as released to DVD.

Now to the reason I feel I must write this, as far as price goes I remember purchasing the individual disks for anywhere between 12 to 15 dollars per disk, so saying the company is just out for money isn't totally correct I feel if you look at u are paying an average of only 10 dollars per disk in most of their sets. I think the reason for the smaller releases is the customer demand for the sets, as it is the DVD releases are very far behind the TV airing. So the company seems to be releasing them in 3 disk sets to help catch up/keep up with the demand for the series.  On  a last note, no one is making anyone purchase these sets (you can watch them online for free) but if you are an avid collector like me, then I recommend getting these as they come out.

As stated at the top, awesome series, don't let the price complaining bad reviews discourage any of you from watching this series....5 stars",1330214400,7,1344,4.173745173745174
4176359,4,B003R3JNQY,Bleach is one of the best animes you can ever watch. But Viz you guys are pissing off a lot of fans by going from a 5 disc box set to a 3. It's ridiculous!! That just tells all of the fans that your just trying to milk out as much money as possible from us and thats complete bullcrap! You should be rewarding those who acually want to buy all of the seasons. I mean come on its very very easy to just download it for no cost. Im not that kind of person But you know how easy it is to do that. originally I would deffinatley reccomend buying all of the seasons.

not much on bonus features here this is how i decide on buy this box set is it cheaper then buying the dvds one by one well with a sell for 30$ its still cheaper then paying 20$ a dvd viz go back to 5 disc box sets please it is such a better deal then what your doing now",1306368000,,529,3.6491228070175437

It only gets worse, since they butchered the seasons by only selling ten to twelve episodes at a time. Seasons merge together from this Dvd set on. Terrible onslaught of a great Anime. Thanks greedy people, for ruining yet another good thing.

And to those who don't like the complaints, obviously you don't know much about consuming. They have ripped you off, and others, and we should stand for ourselves, and ask for the real Box sets to please be returned for us to purchase.",1303257600,2,632,4.495652173913044

But...these episodes ROCK! The previous set (The Assult) that concluded the Bounts was getting tiresome. Right off the start, box set 6 feels like season 1-3. The action is powerful, character building pulls you in (Ichigo's dad and Ikkaku!), and the humor had me rolling a few times.

Again, if you can get past the price, and you liked seasons 1-3, you will not be disappointed watching box set 6. On pure watching value this is a 5 star. By it and enjoy it.",1301184000,16,567,4.4423076923076925

4176367,3,B003R3JNQY,"Here's where the anime kicks it up and...starts picking our pockets. The episodes included in BOX SET 6 and beyond are the episodes that provide somewhat a new feeling to the anime. As much as I follow Bleach, it's starting to make more sense to follow it through adult swim. BOX SETS 1-5 had on average about 20 episodes because they were SEASON BOX SETS...so what happened to SEASON 6? These ""BOX SETS"" are a way to throw some of the episodes at us before the SEASON BOX SET becomes available. MULTIPLE guides pertaining to anime SEASONS state that SEASON 6 does have 21 episodes included. SEASON 7 begins with episode 132, and has 19 episodes. So why pay the same price for a BOX SET with almost half the episodes than a SEASON BOX SET? For now I'll wait till the proper SEASON BOX SETS are released.",1299628800,5,803,4.4324324324324325

I cannot in good conscience buy a season box like this..its just wrong.

half a season for twice what a full season should cost is so wrong there isn't a phrase for it that doesn't include a lot of swear words.

if you want more people to buy Bleach put whole seasons together, and cut the price in half. (the way the first season was. yeah i bought that one.) otherwise people will just keep watching them free online.

The episodes included are great (hence the three stars) but the package is weak. i would much rather wait longer and shell out a few extra dollars to get a 20+ episode set with a nice art box (like the boxes for the first three sets that included a flip book kind of box with an image for each DVD). but instead, we get the, lets cram the first three volumes into one and slap a picture of ichigo on it box set.

Half of a season for this much money is ridiculous. It's not even in a box set of dvd sleeves like the three volumes of the Bount arc. You get one single DVD case with three DVDs inside the case. (Picture a Blu-ray, DVD, digital disc combo pack. Three disc holders in one little package) and absolutely nothing extra like the first three seasons offered.

I only bought this because I could pile up the discounts at the store where I purchased it and managed to get it for $16. 16 for 12 episodes is a better price than 40 or 50 for 12. That's insane.

Viz continues its reign of terror over anime fans by canceling the much beloved Monster animated series after only releasing one box set last year in December(I still feel very jaded about that)no news was given about this..they simply canceled it not saying a word at all to the anime fan base..this is what Viz does..they will continue to do this because they simply don't give a damn about there titles..sadly its just how it is folks..The episodes of Bleach that aired on Adult Swim months ago have yet to be released on DVD..so lets hope Viz can release the DVDs faster..but that won't be happening..at the manga end of things they are just as bad..Viz seriously needs to get there act together.,1291420800,3,934,4.701219512195122

I've been torrenting bleach since it was being fansubbed in 2004. I've downloaded every episode and and continue to do so when new ones are released. I've also bought the first 3 box sets which were released by viz (not gonna pay money for the bount, though) because i really enjoy the show and DO want to support things which i think are worth supporting. It was pretty painful having to wait literally FIVE YEARS after the japanese dvds were released before americans got their own, but i figured that they would be worth the wait of Viz's usual snail's pace. I was right. Until now.

Guess i have no choice now but to wait for them to try again. (how many times did dbz get released as sets in america before they finally figured out how to do it right?)

4176389,3,B003R3JNQY,"My family is a major fan of Bleach, Inuyasha and Naruto that are distributed by Viz. (We have other series that are distributed by Viz but I am focusing on these three for this review)

Inuyasha ~ (we own all seven seasons - just waiting for the last season ""Inuyasha Final Act"" to be released by Viz to wrap up the series) Each set of Inuyasha has one season per unit. With Naruto ~ we have all Naruto uncut box through 16 and all available Shippuden up to 3 thus far. Naruto from the beginning has it bundled as a box set, not seasons so in the consumer's mind establishes a sense of stability and integrity.

We just got Bleach 6 in the mail today and was aggravated. We feel a same sense as others that have left comments.

Bleach up to season 3 was a season per unit (like Inuyasha). Then, not sure if it was following Funimations' (another distributor of Japanese anime) move of 1/2 season per box set idea but Bleach season 4 was made into 2 units. Then Viz packaged Bleach season 5 as a solid unit. We have had Season 6 pre-ordered for a while now and as a consumer hoped it would stay one season per unit. It is in my hand and I find it is not the case. It looks like Viz decided to switch packaging format AGAIN to a Naruto uncut box set format of 3 DVDs.  Even with Naruto Uncut box units, many came included with cards or booklets or something, this Bleach 6 - nothing - not even an inside removable sleeve. The quality of the Bleach 6 box set packaging itself seems sub par to Naruto and previous Bleach units too. It looks like the Bleach labeled as 7 (not available yet) is a box set too with what I am assuming to be 3 DVDs and not a full season yet again.

Being inconsistent as a merchant to us loyal consumers is real disheartening. Bleach the series itself is not the thing that is the issue but how Viz is handling its distribution of the series.

As a consumer, do I trust that Viz will stay with this current set up until Bleach ends as a series or will Viz switch things around yet again? I am leaving the cost factor to the ratio of episode per unit out of this review because I feel Viz needs to find something that fits them and STICK to it.

Will Viz do this with future releases of other different anime units in the future? We are worried how Viz will distribute up coming season titles we want like Vampire Knight / VK Guilty, Inuyasha Final Act, Nura: Rise of the Yokai Clan, etc...
Will Viz start messing with Shippuden too?
I guess what I am trying to say, it is a trust issue with Viz not with Bleach the series itself.

If a consumer has not bought the series - Bleach, itself is a wonderful series, we absolutely enjoy it even with the fillers. We are thankful that Viz brings the world of Japanese anime to us English speakers but please Viz with a series with many seasons, please pick a way to distribute it and stick with it. A one time unforeseen complication that would force an inconsistent distribution change is grumbling acceptable but not the numerous changes of how Viz has handled Bleach.",1286150400,11,3038,4.262152777777778

""Bleach Uncut Box Set 6"" is no exception, with Ichigo forced to grapple with his inner darkness even as Aizen's newest threat arrives to attack them all.

A strange transfer student named Shinji arrives at Ichigo's school, and soon reveals himself to be a Visored -- a Soul Reaper with Hollow powers. It turns out that Ichigo's inner Hollow is starting to devour him from the inside. The Visoreds are his only hope for controlling his power -- and if he fails, he'll lose everything.

At the same time, deadly Hollows are attacking Kon and Uryu... only for them to be rescued by a surprising pair of powerful men. And Uryu is offered a deal that could restore his powers in full... as long as he never associates with Soul Reapers again.

Unfortunately, these Hollows are just the vanguard for a new, more dangerous breed of Hollow -- arrancars, who have been given humanoid forms and Soul Reaper powers by Aizen. So a squad of Soul Reapers (very familiar ones, naturally) are sent to the world of the living to help Ichigo fight -- but when they attack, they may be too much even for the Soul Society's best.

After a long tepid filler arc, it's pretty refreshing to get back to the main ""Bleach"" storyline -- arrancar, visoreds, the return of Grand Fisher (the hollow that killed Ichigo's mother), and some rather shocking revelations about Ichigo's family. What's more, we're introduced to two brand new casts of characters.

And while things start on a rather light'n'fluffy note, the plot takes some dark twists; one of the best parts is when Chad and Orihime are badly injured by the arrancar, and Ichigo is forced to confront his own helplessness. This is some of the strongest characterization our hero has had, and it's really wrenching to see him falling into a deep, sorrowful funk of guilt and fear. The scene where Rukia forces him to apologize to Orihime is adorable, though.

And after some plot-heavy episodes, the last five episodes are all about the usual shonen-anime String Of Epic Fights. Just wait till you see what Ikkaku does -- giant spinny axe attack! The downside of this set? Only twelve episodes for a full-season price, so I'd advise waiting for a temporary price drop, because this is too expensive. Come on! Couldn't we at least get eighteen? Eighteen is all I ask!

At the moment for dvds they are up to episode 126, so there are 42 episodes left until the box sets catch up to where t.v. left off.

SEPTEMBER 28, 2010 Update

I was able to physically look at this ""box set"" at Bestbuy this morning and all I can say is wow..... seriously?  Viz has once again changed the packaging on box sets.  The thinkpak dvd cases with flimsy cardboard box are gone.  Packaging is very similar to the Diamond Dust Rebelion except it holds one additional dvd.  Box set 6 comes in a standard black 14mm at the spine 3 disc case with a cardboard slipcase.  The slipcase cover is exactly what amazon has pictured, but the oval part is cutout so you can see Ichigo underneath.  Additionaly since the dvd case is black that means no reversable cover.  Subtitles are in english, and the audio is english/japanese 2.0.  About the only redeeming quality about this set is that it's called BOX SET 6 not season set 6.  Although doubtful, at least there is some hope a SEASON 6 BOX SET may be released in the future.",1281571200,11,1589,4.496503496503497

So what to do?  Buy it at the silly price here...don't buy it at all....or buy it elsewhere.

When I realized Box Set 5 still continued the lamest filler in Bleach history, I decided to skip it, just as I did with Season 4.  I certainly wasn't about to pay the price Amazon (and most other retailers) wanted for it.

Two days after Box Set 5's release, I was in a WalMart.  I had priced the box set online at their website, along with other retailers.  I was happily surprised to find the Box Set priced much lower on the shelf than the online (which was already lower than Amazon's).  Because of the lower price, I bought it.

So the bottom line is...if you're extremely angry, stop making the purchases.  VIZ certainly isn't forcing you.  If you still want it, just go to WalMart and at least save yourself $7-10 from buying it here.  Or for an even better deal, watch it online and hold out for that online price drop.

4176441,2,B003R3JNQY,"Dear Anime Fans,

 Lets us face a cold hard truth. Anime companies are in business to make the most money they can. Remember, they are not Warner Brothers, Pixar, or even Disney. This means they do not have parent companies that can bail them out if they fail to make a profit.  These prices are high, but I am old enough to recall the days in which you paid 19 dollars for 4 episodes and this was cheap. Moreover, you had to pay 100 dollars or more if you wanted a complete series.  The prices these days are relativity cheap than in the 90s and 00s.  Above all, you have to remember that anime companies like computer companies bank on one fact-people have no patience. They want immediate gratification and will not settle for anything less. In other words, we fans want all the Bleach episodes available and at a reasonable price.  The reasonable prices come much later. Case in point, I bought the 4 sets of Kenichi the Mightiest Disciple as each set came out. Recently, the anime company released Sets 1 and 2 together and at cheaper price. I paid the price for my impatience.  If you want the cheap prices you have to wait until the product cools down. As for bleach, the older episodes should be cheaper by the end of this year because most people have been consumed with the new ones. If you cannot wait, read the manga. This is the cheaper way to get your anime fix and the manga gives more incite and information that contained in the anime.  If you cannot wait, you can always buy the bootleg additions. I neither condone this practice (I have many) but you can get the entire series intact and at cheap price. What is more, the quality is really good.  I realize that my comments skid the razors edge between supporting anime companies and ensuring consumers satiate their needs; however, I believe it provides insight into how far the anime world had evolved in the States.",1279411200,6,1887,4.494152046783626
4176442,3,B003R3JNQY,"I can agree with a lot of the other reviewers about how they're annoyed or upset that the season 6 box set for bleach is being split just like season four. complaining aside there are other options then just online to atain this boxset, for example when the two box sets for season four came out I acctually managed to get both box sets at walmart for a decent price which was close to half the 50 dollar price tag, ok not exactly half but pretty close if you guys are upset about the price shop around you can find good deals on or offline",1279324800,2,540,4.152380952380953
4176443,1,B003R3JNQY,"When I got Season 5 I was shocked that it ended when it did.  I have always held season five progressing till Oriheme (mispelled) was taken by the Arrancar's and then Ichigo goes after her.  That is when Season 5 SHOULD end.  So I went to Bleach on Wikipedia and saw that Season 5 ended when it should have in the box set.  Season 6, however, are episodes 110 to 131 NOT 121 VIZ.  You are screwing the Americans for more money.  I believe we should let them know that we are aware and no longer stand for it.",1279152000,9,508,4.08080808080808
