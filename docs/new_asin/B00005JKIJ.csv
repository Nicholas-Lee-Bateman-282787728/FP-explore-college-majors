1435846,3,B00005JKIJ,"Eye of the Devil (J. Lee Thompson, 1967)

Eye of the Devil is an atmospheric little film directed by a great director on a downward slide, starring a number of actors who were either on their way up or on their way down, and based on a novel that could generously be called obtuse. Is it any wonder that it made almost no splash when it was released? Now that it's available on DVD, however, you have a chance to discover an overlooked sixties gem.

Phillippe de Montfaucon (David Niven) is called back to his family's estate in Brittany, and cautions his wife Catherine (Deborah Kerr) not to follow him. She does, thanks to the restlessness of their son Jacques (Robert Duncan), and finds the family's estate to be quite odd. Montfaucon's mother Estelle (Flora Robson) refuses to see her after one awkward encounter, and the ominous de Caray twins, Odile (Sharon Tate) and Christian (David Hemmings), are always skulking about. The village chaplain (Donald Pleasance), far from providing comfort, seems to be quite gung-ho about the weirdness. Catherine is well aware that something bad is going to happen, but will she be able to figure out what it is and stop it?

The movie is just this side of incomprehensible for much of its length, and is saved solely by the quality of its cast. But what a cast it is. Tate, Hemmings, and Pleasance are fantastic in their parts. Niven is somewhat less so, but it's possible to write off his distracted air given the movie's climax (which, of course, it would be a spoiler to reveal). Kerr is clueless, but then she's supposed to be. As interesting as the cast is, what was taking place behind the camera was just as impressive; whoever's decision it was to film this in black and white is to be commended, as it works very well. It has the feel of a thirties or forties mystery about it, and it plays on that nostalgia a good deal (this may be more recognizable now than it was then, of course, given that we're forty years farther removed). Thompson was past it by this point, only a few years away from his nadir directing a string of Charles Bronson revenge potboilers, but he still has some of the old grace in him. The lighting and sound are superb, though the soundtrack seems a bit off to me. Something moodier would probably have been more appropriate.

All in all, though, a film that deserves much more attention than it's gotten. ***",1205107200,11,2386,4.5807962529274
1435847,5,B00005JKIJ,"Deborah Kerr made two legendary horror pictures in her carreer: ""The Innocents"" (based on the story by Henry James) and ""Eye Of The Devil"", both are in black and white. And both are without blood, without brutality. Very good made films, full of intelligent suspense, with much love for the details. And serious! ""The Innocents"" are available on DVD, while ""Eye Of The Devil"" isn't. I think it's time to bring out ""Eye Of The Devil"" on DVD now! It plays at an old castle and tells the story of the deadly secret of the family who lives there. David Hemmings and David Niven starring brillant in the picture - like Deborah Kerr! And don't forget Sharon Tate, her role is incredible, she says no word, sitting on a stone before the castle all time in this film.

1435849,4,B00005JKIJ,"From the novel ""The Day Of The Arrow"" by Phillip Loraine, this is a supernatural thriller concerning a creepy ch?teau in the French countryside, beset by bizarre occurrences and rumors of witchcraft. Phillipe De Monfaucon, Marquis de Bellac (David Niven), his wife, Catherine (Deborah Kerr) and their children, Jacques (Robert Duncan) and Antionette (Suky Appleby) become concerned and then victimized by the mysteriousness, including the presence of foreboding brother and sister, Christian (David Hemmings) and Odile (Sharon Tate)D'Carey. It soon becomes clear that the menacing pair is attempting to initiate the family into their cult. Even the village priest Father Dominick (Donald Pleasance) appears to have a sinister agenda. An interesting premise, excellent cast, glorious black and white photography; a cult favorite in the making. Young up and comers Hemmings and Tate embody their cherubic blonde innocence and evil blackness wonderfully - their appearance only enhances one's feelings of dread and menace. Although only listed seventh in the credits, Tate remains a lovely presence, and definitely worth watching. The parallels between her tragic demise just a few years later and her role here is almost too close for comfort.

A very unnerving, effective supernatural chiller.",1145059200,20,1292,5.625641025641026
1435850,5,B00005JKIJ,"but it adds a surreal touch to her beauty and to her character, Odile.

This is one of those movies that can keep up the suspense no matter how many times you've watched it.  It gets more haunting each time.

David Niven and Deborah Kerr were world-class actors but I agree with the reviewer from Norway in that they were too old-looking to be playing parents to such young children.  (If the kids were a little older, it would be a different story.)  Other than that, I felt sorry for Philippe de Montfaucon (Niven) at the end of the film when he met his end (as cold, unfeeling, and willing to accept his fate as he was, his family be damned).  Catherine de Montfaucon (Kerr) indeed was not going to sit back and accept her husband's fate.  She fought hard but her efforts were in vain.

In Sharon's first film role, she played the part of wicked Odile convincingly.  She has a blank stare on her face throughout the film but whenever that beautiful face pops up on the screen, you can't help but be mesmerized and wonder what evil deed she will perform next.

And I lost my heart when I saw David Hemmings.  Even with a blank expression on his face, he's still good looking.  He and Sharon were a great combination of the evil siblings.

All in all, a classic black and white film full of suspense and definitely worth the time to view, especially to see the very talented Sharon Tate.

It is also a faithful adaptation of Philip Loraine's book, ""Day of the Arrow.""",1114992000,16,1468,4.408921933085502
1435851,4,B00005JKIJ,"This is Sharon Tate`s film... She steals every scene she`s in and she delivers a chilling precense:-)  David  Niven is brilliant as Philippe, as are David Hemmings, Flora Robson and Donald Pleasance. The film is uneven, but should always be watched because of it near-perfect cast.

 Miss Kerr would have been good 10 years earlier, but looks too old to play a mama with so young children... Her scene on the roof with Sharon however, is a classic.",1103500800,7,448,4.705128205128205
1435852,5,B00005JKIJ,"I am surprised this movie is not out on DVD or video because it's one of the few films of the beautiful Sharon Tate, the actress killed by the Mason Cult.  Supposedly her ""introduction"" film along with fellow actor David Hemmings, MGM made a big todo of showcasing them before the films release.
The film was also called 13 in some releases, and the supposedly unlucky number seems apropos for the film with Tate later being murdered, and the trouble over initial casting.  The simply gorgeous Kim Novak was set to play the lead, they had actually begun filming when she was thrown from a horse.  A broken bone resulted in her being replaced by the powerhouse Deborah Kerr, who seems, truthfully, better suited to be playing David Niven's wife.
This is like no other Niven film, an high popular, but I believe, underrated actor.  He made it seems so easy.  But you watch him with Gregory Peck in GUNS OF NAVARONE and you will see he was a marvellous talent.
It's a low-key thriller, in the WICKERMAN vein.  Kerr, Niven and family have been living a good life in Paris, but the arrival of mysterious priest from Niven's home, starts them spiralling into a nightmare of unbelievable proportions.  Niven, says the countryside of his province requires the return of the Marquis de Bellac, there is a prolong draught of years, and he must go back, though he won't say what he can do to stop a draught.  He insists Kerr and the children stay behind.
In typical headstrong fashion, Kerr is not content to remain behind being the 'little woman', so she and the children travel to the medieval honour of Bellac.  Stuck in a time warp of the Middle Ages, Bellac is a total feudal estate.  Niven in NOT happy to see she has come.  She soon runs afoul of two strange young people (Hemmings, an archer, and the beautiful Tate, who shows disdain for all the males around her).  Though they are not really a part of the estate, they seems to come and go as they please and laugh at Kerr's affront.
The strange priest, played by Donald Pleasence, continues to exert a strong hold over Niven, almost as if he is compelling and preparing Niven for 'what will come'.  It is clear things are very wrong at Bellac.  After a ride in the wood, she discovers that nearly every Bellac Marquis has died a mysterious death at an young age, and is harassed by hooded monk-like figures after finding the tomb of the last Marquis in the wood.  There are strange comings and goings at all hours.  Niven;s aunt tucks her head and ignores it all, but seems ready to burst into tears.  A strange man is hiding in the attic and he warns her to leave before it's too late. Oddly, she discovered though the whole area is very religious, the religion has a taint of heresy about it.
One day, she catches Tate teaching the children to play on the edge of the crenellations of the roof.  When she rushes up to stop it, she soon finds herself at peril, as Tate hypnotises her in to nearly stepping off the roof.
Worse, is the distance between her and her husband, and his insistence he has accepted his fate.
Very understated, mesmerising dancing in the ring of 13....with a knockout of an ending.
Ted Turner occasionally shows this - beware he cuts it bloody pieces!
POWERFUL!
Highly recommended to those who appreciate The WICKERMAN.",1046649600,59,3294,4.554237288135593
1435853,5,B00005JKIJ,"I remember seeing this on late nite television when I was very young.  It is funny how certain images stay with us.  I remember being at once attracted to Sharon Tate (a true beauty) and yet kinda scared because she was a wicked girl in this movie and it made me very uneasy.  But I was able to see this film, of all places at a midnight show in London (in August 1999) , and it has real atmoshpere and chills.  And to be sure, Sharon Tate may finally be remembered for something else than the way she died.  Her beauty is almost intoxicating and I don't mean that in a lesbionic way, she just was.

This may have been shocking in the sixties, but modern viewers need deeper exploration of a subculture psyche that eagerly sacrifices a fellow human for the benefit of its crops to be believable. And so the story plodded along, the characters playing their roles in this dystopia without any comprehensible, or meaningful motivation for their actions.

This movie might have been a riveting, even great story had the plot been developed to be more believable. The story, characters, and their motivations were just too superficial.

The storyline is so ludicrous that all potential scares are deflated from the enterprise.  One plus is that siblings played by David Hemmings and Sharon Tate make for a creepy pair.

This is like a veddy veddy upper crust, stiff upper lip version of Children of The Corn, but far more sophisticated and in its' own way, far more terrifying.

It's the best film to date in my opinion depicting a more gruesome aspect of ancient western pagan tradition; a tradition of human sacrifice that was practiced by almost every ancient global culture.

The film is so eloquent and finely tuned that the psychological element is permitted to permeate the viewers imagination effortlessly and plant the seeds of a growing, creeping horror in the viewers already fertile mind.

1435998,3,B00005JKIJ,"J. Lee Thompson's 'Eye of the Devil' (Filmways/MGM UK, 1966), while stylishly photographed and impeccably cast and acted, really isn't anything more than an upscale Corman/Price film from the period ('Haunted Palace,' 'House of Usher,' 'Masque of the Red Death'-- take your pick) with a decidedly less campy feel (due largely to the technical attributes I just mentioned).  It can, I suppose, be considered a bridge between the story-bookish witches-and-sorcerers horror flicks that were growing in popularity in the early sixties ('Burn, Witch, Burn,' 'City of the Dead,' etc.) and the 'realistic,' socially paranoiac pagan/Satanist films that preoccupied audiences later in the decade and through much of the seventies ('Rosemary's Baby,' 'Wicker Man,' 'The Omen,' etc.), but that distinction doesn't change the fact that EOTD isn't a terribly effective chiller.  The main problem-- aside from a lack of narrative clarity-- is that the situation Ms. Kerr (revisiting her victim-of-extreme-circumstances role from 1961's far superior 'The Innocents') finds herself in is revealed almost immediately, telegraphed in no uncertain terms by the weird behavior of everyone around her, which obviates the events that unfold over the ensuing 90 minutes, badly impairing the film's ability to build suspense through a process of fear-inducing discovery.  Kerr is a great actress.  Niven, while arguably underutilized here, is equally superb.  (I wonder, did the two of them wait around on the castle set at MGM's Hertfordshire studio until shooting began on 1967's 'Casino Royale'?)  Hemmings, Mulhare, Robson, Pleasance-- all pros.  But saddled as it is with a screenplay that offers only a handful of creepy vignettes (the robed figures gathered in the forest is a nice example) to demonstrate the urgency of the protagonist's (and her children's) life-and-death predicament, even Oscar-caliber performances couldn't have rescued EOTD from cinematic mediocrity.  3 stars.",1414540800,2,1966,5.640677966101695

1436046,5,B00005JKIJ,"I can't believe I've not watched this dark and suspenseful British occult drama before now (I viewed it on TCM). There are several things that distinguish this film, one of which is the choice of casting. Big name stars such as David Niven and Deborah Kerr headline this production, although Kerr came onboard only after the first choice Kim Novak suffered an injury after falling from a horse, halfway through filming, so the production team had to start shooting again from the beginning, this time with Kerr in the lead role. Nevertheless, Kerr excels in her role here.

Niven plays the Marquis Phillippe de Montfaucon who returns to his ancestral home in Bellenac, France to oversee the failing family wine business: the crops have failed for a third year in a row and something needs to be done. Against his wishes, his lovely wife Catherine (Kerr) insists she and their two children, Jacques and Antoinette remain with him. Before long, Catherine begins to notice strange goings-on which appear to revolve around a sinister pair of siblings, Christian and Odile de Caray ( David Hemmings and Sharon Tate; Tate was in her first movie role here). Then there's the ominous-looking priest, Father Pere Dominic (Donald Pleasance). What is Catherine to make of all these goings-on?

Archery, the use of bow and arrows, is a recurring motif in this film, and aptly so, for ""Eye of the Devil"" aka ""13"" is an adaptation of Phillip Loraine's novel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/13-also-released-as-Day-of-the-Arrow/dp/9001336256/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">13 - also released as Day of the Arrow</a>.  It is used to creepy effect in this film, and each time one sees Hemmings' Christian de Caray armed with his bow and arrows, the sense of evil malevolence is very palpable.

Kerr's role as the beleaguered wife, Catherine, is reminiscent of her role as the governess in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Innocents/dp/B0009X75EC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Innocents</a>, and Niven is credible in his portrayal as the tormented Marquis. However, it is Sharon Tate who deserves special mention here for her noteworthy performance as the cold-hearted Odile de Caray. Her eyes are incredibly expressive and coolly calculating, and her body language suitably seductive, so that viewers are left without a doubt as to the fact that this is a woman up to no good.

The film was made in 1966 yet it is filmed in B&W. I'm not sure why but I found this to be to the story's advantage. The lack of color emphasizes the sense of foreboding evil which permeates the entire film, and one particular scene really got my heart beating a little faster: the one where Catherine and Odile are on the top of the castle. The dialogue aside, the body movements mimicked some sort of morbid dance of death and was truly chilling. The use of B&W cinematography is also highly effective in a scene featuring the hapless Catherine being surrounded by dark, hooded figures in the woods. This scene in particular brought to mind another favorite occult film, 1960's ""The City of the Dead"" aka&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horror-Hotel-City-of-the-Dead/dp/B006OT40ZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horror Hotel (City of the Dead)</a>, which was also filmed in B&W. The lack of color together with the haunting soundtrack made this an effective chiller.

The rich, menacing atmosphere and excellent cast elevates this above the average occult thriller and though perhaps not a classic like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wicker-Man-1973-HD/dp/B0091WAWTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wicker Man (1973) [HD</a>] (which ""Eye of the Devil"" shares some similarities with), it is certainly an under-rated gem that deserves a wider audience.",1382400000,4,3886,5.726169844020797
1436047,5,B00005JKIJ,"I was thrilled to hear that this classic MGM Film was being released on DVD for the first time (it was never released on VHS either).

At the same time I purchased another Sharon DVD released at the same time, Don't Make Waves. The ""Waves"" DVD had film  trailer, but ""Eye"" DVD has no film trailer plus a scratchy copy of the print was used. I have a great quality bootleg of ""Eye"" that contains a short used to promote ""Eye"" called ""All Eyes On Sharon Tate"". I was thinking the actual studio version would be superior, right? Wrong! If you buy the DVD for the movie and can ignore poor transfer you're in for a treat! The plot involves a Marquis (Niven) who has to travel to his native country where the grape harvest is failing. He has to leave his unsuspecting wife (Kerr) and two young children behind. Knowing something is wrong Kerr follows. At the castle we have an evil brother & sister duo who are warlocks & witches (Hemmings & Tate). Not going any further with the plot as I don't want to ruin the storyline. I give the DVD 5 stars for the stars & the great quality of the film itself. You would think there would be a clearer print of this film in the Turner archive!

1436082,3,B00005JKIJ,"I couldn't help but think of THE WICKER MAN while watching this film (it came seven years after EYE OF THE DEVIL).  Quite a few similarities.

From what I've read, Kim Novak was supposed to be lead--and she was--until she fell off a horse while shooting. Deborah Kerr was brought in to finish the film after they reshoot all of Kim's scenes.  I will always wonder how the movie would've played if it had Kim's dark, alluring beauty in it.  I love Deborah Kerr...but there's no amount of dark side that would turn her.  Kim looks like she could've joined Sharon Tate as the witch atop the castle at any second.  I guess we'll never know.

That's the other thing this film is known for: Sharon Tate's debut.  And she's gorgeous.  Even as a one-expression witch, she's still stunning.

There's also an excellent supporting cast.  David Niven, David Hemmings, Donald Pleasance.

It's not particularly scary or even gets very creepy, so I'd recommend THE WICKER MAN made seven years later (and not that godawful remake with Nicolas Cage).",1353801600,3,1033,4.741573033707865

1436084,4,B00005JKIJ,"...this film which was originally called 13 (it's still listed as that in the end title credits). I'm sure the title was changed to make it sound more horrific. I assume it refers to a pagan amulet used in the film although no one ever calls it that. While watching this film I was struck by similarities to two other films beside THE WICKER MAN. One was a little known 1953 film called THE MAZE about a man who returns to his ancestral home in Scotland and a terrible secret. His fiance' follows him there and encounters hostility and psychological terror. The other is the 1959 cult shocker CITY OF THE DEAD better known as HORROR HOTEL. The outfits and behavior of the worshippers is almost exactly the same.

EYE OF THE DEVIL is a real oddity. It was shot in black and white in 1966 when most films were in color. This could have been a budgetary consideration although EYE features two major stars of the period in David Niven and Deborah Kerr (who replaced another major star Kim Novak). The director, J. Lee Thompson, only a few years removed from the major successes THE GUNS OF NAVARONNE and CAPE FEAR, was still considered a top tier director. The look of the film recalls Deborah Kerr's earlier psychological thriller THE INNOCENTS as well as the original THE HAUNTING and it seems to have been influenced by the 1940s movies of Val Lewton. Excellent pedigrees to have.

The story revolves around a modern day French aristocrat (Niven) who is called back to his family's ancient home to deal with failing vineyards. His wife (Kerr) and their two children follow later and she runs into a wall of resistance and secrecy. There's a mysterious brother and sister duo (David Hemmings and Sharon Tate) hindering her attempts at knowledge of what goes on there and a charismatic priest (Donald Pleasance) who holds the key to what is happening. The photography is stark and atmospheric and the committed performances help to put it over. A first class transfer on this Warner Archive DVD cannot be faulted. Horrific? Not really. Scary? Certainly not. It is, however, deeply unsettling and if that's the kind of movie you prefer then you need to get this release before it disappears.",1342224000,2,2188,4.710182767624021
1436085,2,B00005JKIJ,"I've read so much about Sharon Tate through the years that I wanted to actually see her in life in one of her film roles. It was tragic to see this beautiful woman alive and vibrant while knowing the future held for her.
EYE OF THE DEVIL seemed like a good starting point with an excellent cast - Deborah Kerr, David Niven and Donald Pleasance. Who could ask for a better cast? Deborah Kerr is looking wonderful in her middle age and she is the star of this film. Although they are an older couple, Philippe and Catherine have two very young children who adore their parents. Life is good for the de Montfaucon family until Philippe is called away to deal with the family vineyard and estate in Bellenac

Philippe needs to take of this matter on his own and without his wife and children joining him. Strong-willed and determined Catherine decides to follow Philippe with the children. Catherine soon learns the family estate is shrouded in mystery and something seemingly diabolitical. The mysterious priest played by Donald Pleasance seems to be a resident of the estate and is alway in clerical garb. Enter Philippe's very odd niece and nephew and the story takes an even more confusing turn. Sharon Tate place the niece Odile, who seems to be in a trance and hold strange power over the children.

EYE OF THE DEVIL is a hard story to follow. Only Catherine's determination to uncover the truth keeps the story going. Sharon Tate is lovely to look at but her role doesn't give her much opportunity to show her acting talents. This 1966 film was shot in Black and White and it seem to help set the stage for the story. I wondered what Deborah Kerr and David Niven thought when they read the script. Did they need the work or did they see some potential in this film that never came through on screen.

It was an all-around disppointing film to watch.",1338768000,3,1852,4.555555555555555

1436091,4,B00005JKIJ,"The sixties gave birth to many films dealing with every aspect of the occult from witchcraft to demonic possession and sometimes they branched off into something else of which director J. Lee Thompson's 'EYE OF THE DEVIL' is one of them.  Without giving way the essence of the plot, the wife of a grand marquis in modern day France gets mixed up in a nightmare involving her husband and children, suffice it too say that it truly is not a horror film per se but an exercise in Paganism and predates Robin Hardy and Anthony Schaeffer's production of 'THE WICKER MAN' by a number of years.  David Niven gives a subdued performance as the Marquis and Deborah Kerr in a role reminiscent of her turn as the governess in Jack Clayton's 'THE INNOCENTS' gives her wife in peril performance a fine driven feel.  David Hemmings right from his debut in Antonioni's 'BLOW UP' and Sharon Tate in her first film role give the proceedings an eerie, unsettling twist but the real stars of the affair are the first rate black and white photography by Erwin Hellier and brilliant editing by Ernest Walter. Always known for his action films, this may be J. Lee Thompson's best work.  Available as a DVD-R from Warner Archive, its a beautiful transfer and an unusual way ahead of its time tragic excercise in traditions and religious beliefs.",1289692800,21,1322,4.685344827586207

7938919,2,B00005JKIJ,"Review of Eye of the Devil
Hot Toasty Rag, October 29, 2017

Deborah Kerr and David Niven, in their fourth screen pairing, play husband and wife. They have a beautiful home, lots of friends, and two young childrenbut somethings amiss. Deborah can sense it, but she never suspects her husband is involved in a generations-deep Satanic cult! Joined by Donald Pleasence, David Hemmings, and Sharon Tate, the cult isn't going to let Deborah and her children take David Niven away from them. . .

Surprisingly, given the title and the premise, Eye of the Devil isn't particularly scary. There are some spooky situations, but there are no gags planted to make the audience jump, and theres no gore. It makes one wonder, what was the purpose of the film? People who don't like scary movies probably won't want to watch it, and people who like to be frightened out of their pants will probably be disappointed.

If you're like me and prefer the treat to the trick in Halloween, this one will be safe for you to rent. The actings as good as youd expect from a horror movie, and at least youll get to see two veteran actors trying out a new genre. But if you're looking for a really scary Devil-worshipping flick, keep looking.",1509235200,,1217,4.625
