2292210,5,B0009I89V0,"All Mine To Give was released in my adolescence.  I have watched the movie several times and each viewing needed an abundance of tissues.  I find it alluring to view several actors/actresses in their earlier years.

This film is an accurate depiction of frontier life; the personal and family values that molded this nation through its infancy.  I find it refreshing to know of a time when neighbors and most in the small community could be trusted.

I highly recommend this movie as an adventure, romance, drama.  Of the few movies I would have in VHS format (not is DVD yet)in my personal library, this is one.",1157241600,8,612,4.672897196261682

2292300,5,B0009I89V0,"This is definitely NOT a version of the great documentary WISCONSIN DEATH STORY.  Instead, take Patty, the adorable little doll from THE BAD SEED, still with those lovely long braids (which apparently never need to be washed and re-braided), and the wonderful Glynis Johns, and do a complete Disney-ish true-story, one that will be perfect for Christmastime.  Some of the shots apparently were done from a sticky tripod head because sometimes you notice sudden annoying horizontal stick-and-slips.  My favorite scene is a birthday surprise party where the kids hide in the dark silently waiting for one of their brothers to come through the front door of the little wooden cabin.  When they all yell SURPRISE, about 20 megawatts of overhead stage lighting slams ON in a blinding glare like an A-bomb detonation, which I suppose was meant to indicate that someone simply lit a beeswax candle or two.  Or maybe the roof blew off at high noon.  (Don't you love to see candles cast shadows?) Anyway, this tear-jerker drama was well acted and has lots of good clean fun.  Afterwards, watch the documentary about THE ORPHAN TRAINS and see another side of the real story.  And try to absorb the idea that children could be given away without Government interference--just knock on doors and ask people if they want a cute little kid to raise.  You know whether they did.  Who would turn away THE BAD SEED?!  McCormack in real life has given the most intelligent interviews I have ever read.  And I loved LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE too.  Surprise!

2292330,5,B0009I89V0,"I watched this movie as one of the four movies in the ""4 Film Favorites (WB) Classic Holiday Collection Vol. 2"" collection, which I borrowed from our county library. The other three movies are more festive and holidayl-like.

It is a good movie, and I'm glad that I watched it. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and it is worth five stars on its own merits, but if you are thinking of watching this movie because it's labeled as a Holiday Movie, all I can say is (Caveat Emptor) ""Let the Borrower Beware.""

Two immigrants come to the United States because the wife's uncle has invited them to come to live at his house in Wisconsin. They arrive to find that house and uncle are gone (house fire), but the community welcomes them.

There is evidence of some bias. Some residents do not approve of their joining their close-knit community, but the majority of the community appears to support them.

The man's boss keeps calling him ""Norski"" (a negative name, perhaps a racial epithet against northerners from Scandinavia; but after the man fights his boss, he earns the boss's respect, and the better nickname, ""Scotty,"" after his scotch ancestry.

One townswoman is more of a bigot than the rest, and it shows through, unfortunately, throughout the movie.

This movie, based on a true story, follows the lives of the family, father, mother, and eventually six kids, as the years pass in Wisconsin. but all is not a holiday. We see the ups and downs of their life which leads eventually to the meaning behind the title,

  ALL MINE TO GIVE

when we find that only the six children now survive, and the oldest, 12 years old I vaguely recall, must decide what is best for all the children. Even while the biased lady is trying to take over all the decisions and put the children when she thinks will do the least harm for her and her friends, our twelve-year-old hero finds the best places for each of his younger siblings, then walks off into the proverbial sunset to go to work.

We are left to our own imagination as to whether they ever saw each other again.

I don't recommend this as a Holiday Movie,

But ...

I do recommend this as a semi-historical movie about what it was like to be immigrants into this country, and to remind ourselves that we've always had immigrants coming into our country.

2292392,5,B0009I89V0,"Don't be misled by the mawkish title!  ""All Mine to Give"" is a warm, touching, but never overly-sentimental film about a pair of Scottish immigrants who settle in Wisconsin during the mid-1800's.  Based on a true story, the first half of the film shows the couple establishing themselves in their new country; the latter half deals with their six children who are orphaned when the oldest son is only twelve years old.  There's humor and heartbreak to spare along the way, and the film strikes a delicate and satisfying balance throughout.

Beautifully filmed in rich, saturated Technicolor and sensitively directed by Allen Reisner, the movie boasts brilliant performances by a huge cast of talented actors, each of whom is given a special chance to shine.  Glynis Johns and Cameron Mitchell are superb as the parents, and juvenile actor Rex Thompson offers an uncommonly fine performance as the eldest son.  Pay close attention to veteran character actor Ernest Truex who plays the town doctor; he manages to tug at the heartstrings even when ""tossing away"" his lines, especially in the scene in which Thompson tries to pay him for the services Truex has rendered throughout the years.

Although this is promoted as a ""holiday movie"" because the climax of the film takes place on Christmas Day, in truth, this fine film is worth watching and enjoying any time of the year.  The DVD offers generally pleasing audio and video (although a couple of scenes near the end have some greenish shadows in them).  There are no extra features.  Still, this film is highly recommended.",1385942400,,1575,4.9543726235741445

This 50s film is just one of a few  minor entries Warner's has issued in recent times around Christmas,such as It Happened on 5th Avenue,Holiday Affair or Blossoms in the Dust. Since all these films are of varying degrees of quality,and none too spectacular,I suppose they figure why not bring them out,dust them off and see whether or not they can make some money off of them from an entirely new generation. I had seen this film on TV way back in the early 60s,I think,and I didn't think much of it. But looking at it now I have a bit higher opinion of it than I originally did.
The story finds an immigrant couple fresh off the boat from the Shetland Islands,Robert and Mamie,seeking a new life in Eureka,Wisconsin in the late 1800s. They come to seek out a relative who lives just outside town but are told that the house burned down just three weeks earlier,and that the relative perished. They sit in despair,but not for too long. Mamie is pregnant and winter is coming on and they decide to stay and build a homestead right beside their relatives burned down home. At first Robert is doing everything by himself,but eventually the nearby towns folks come along and chip in to help him and his wife build the house and welcome them properly into their town.
Robert gets a job in a lumber camp over 20 miles from home. The boss is a cantankerous Irishman(Hale)and the two are constantly butting heads. Eventually a fight man to man changes their feelings towards each other,and they become fast friends. One baby comes along,followed by another and still another until there are six children in all. Robert quits his lumbering work and starts a boat building business beside their home. One day one of their younger sons contracts diphtheria. Robert takes the children away for a spell and the crisis soon passes. However Robert himself comes down with the disease and succumbs to it.
Mamie takes over as head of the household but she becomes worn down to a frazzle and succumbs to typhoid fever,leaving young Robbie,their first born,as the head of the household. It is Christmas eve and they bury their mother,but as the children leave the church,young Robbie talks with the doctor about their future. Everyone is concerned for their welfare,but Robbie persuades them to put off a proposed meeting to deal with them until after Christmas. The doctor and others present acquiesce to his request. Once home Robbie gets to thinking that Christmas day might be the ideal time for him to start farming out his brothers and sisters to proper foster homes in the area. It is a good idea as Robbie does indeed spend a long and emotional Christmas day making sure each and every sibling is taken care of. The film ends as Robbie heads off alone to work in a lumber camp,in the deep snow.
The film takes a while to warm itself up to its viewing audience. Mitchell's Scottish brogue leaves alot to be desired,and the couple is your usual Hollywood stereotypical Scots. I can see someone from Edinburgh sitting there saying""You have to be kidding me"".It's not until the couple finally begin having and raising their children that the film really starts to get a little interesting. We also wonder while this is happening what the picture has to do with Christmas,but of course the pay off finally comes near the end. The film is a good family picture though and has alot of real family values,warmth and heart. That is the key message that comes through loud and clear after all is said and done. Very few films are made like this today,unfortunately.
Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is in wonderful viewing condition. There are no extras.
All in all a nice little family film,gushing with family warmth,togetherness and heart. Once over the obvious flaws in characterization,and the slow beginning,it does eventually start to pay off and the Christmas connection is more than apparent with its bitter sweet ending.

***Spoiler alert?*** This is an incredibly sad movie about a family of six kids left alone through tragedy. I can't imagine this is really a spoiler, as the whole concept of the movie is based on this simple fact. You can see the events unrolling a mile away as well, so I don't think it should come as a surprise.

Our papa would tell us the story over and over again about the orphans and how the oldest son gave his siblings away one by one.

I remember seeing this back in the early 60's when I was a real young kid. During the mid-2000 year I started to remember this film again for some unknown reason.
I search and search for a DVD version of this at local video stores and at the internet and it was basically non-existent. Then it was announced that it was gonna be released on DVD on November, 2008 by Warner Bros. I was intent on buying it; but for some reason (economic recession), I let it slide by. The cheapest one at that time was $10.49 at Deep Discount DVD. But I bide my time in buying it.
Fast forward to December 2009, I was ready to buy it, but it was no longer in print! Within less than a year this film's DVD version was gone. Regular E-tailers like Amazon, Deep Discount, CD Universe, Overstock no longer carry it. You couldn't even rent it at Netflix.

'Got it today and was happy to know that it's in color and Widescreen format, not the 1.33:1 format that Amazon put on their DVD specs.

2292501,5,B0009I89V0,"WARNING, SPOILERS, etc.

This DVD's cover art, which is original to the movie's release over fifty years ago, has a tagline that reads: ""Six kids on a true and wonderful adventure!"" This is one of the most misleading teasers in cinematic public relations history. It has the reader imagining a sextuplet of young ones perhaps sledding on particularly icy mountains or facing down some Scrooge-like, anti-Christmas archnemesis. In fact, it's about children losing both parents to highly contagious diseases and having their family rent permanently asunder.

This tale is based on a true-life story set in Wisconsin. Robert and Mamie Eunson (Cameron Mitchell and Glynis Johns) are Scots who have just landed in America (the year is 1856), having been invited there by Mamie's uncle. They arrive in the tiny logging village of Eureka, only to be informed that both uncle and his cabin have been incinerated in a house fire. The Eunsons are assisted by the friendly locals in reconstructing the house and Robert takes to tipping timber. It should be noted Mamie is heavily pregnant upon their reaching Eureka; she delivers baby Robbie soon after the cabin is completed. Robert eventually starts a successful boat building business and Mamie gives birth to five more children: Jimmy, Kirk, Annabelle, Elizabeth, and Jane. The Eunsons are prospering and happy--until little Kirk is diagnosed with diptheria. Mamie and Kirk are quarantined while Robert takes the other children away. The boy recovers, but the goodbye kiss he gave Dadda before his departure proves fatal, and Mr. Eunson succumbs.

Mamie takes to working as a seamstress and Robbie becomes the man of the house. Things stabilize, but only briefly: tired and work-worn, Mamie contracts typhoid. Knowing she won't survive, she charges her eldest with finding good homes for his siblings. After her death, Robbie does exactly that, dispatching his brothers and sisters to kindly townsfolk. Stoic and resigned during the process, he does break down when he's alone and sees the tree outside the homestead where his father had carved the names of the children into the bark. Baby Jane is the last to be handed over--Robbie stands at the door of a house and asks the woman who answers, ""Will you take my sister, ma'am?"" Pathos, lachrymose, mourning, and gloom! (It reminds me that in Great Britain, this movie was released under the title The Day They Gave Babies Away...*gulp*!)

He then turns and trudges, solitary and struggling, up a hill in a snowstorm. You may ask, ""What does this horribly sad tale have to do with Christmas?"" Robbie is breaking up the clan on Christmas Eve, wisely thinking people are more likely to accept taking in an orphan while filled with the holiday spirit.

I remember having my grade school show this film when I was a kid and half the auditorium was weeping openly by the end. While many people would avoid something this maudlin during a time of year we're enjoined to be merry and bright, I find it triumphant and warm-hearted.  Trade a viewing of this classic release for one of the bubble-gum, toothless cinematic confections Hollywood releases every year in December...",1229299200,98,3162,5.0248091603053435

2292529,4,B0009I89V0,"Robert osborne said this was the greatest tearjerker of all time so I devoted days of my Christmas vacation to watching the thing, sneaking it on when my wife was out of the room, for she hates tear jerkers and prefers more artistic pictures.

Yes, I was a little disapppointed in the results, for at the end I came away thinking, that was awfully sad, but when I touched my face I felt no tears, only the familiar dryness that comes when a face has been pressed too close to the TV screen.  In fact I hadn't come close to crying once, except maybe when the Scots accents of Cameron Mitchell and Glynis Johns threatened to undermine my understanding of their dialogue.

All I can say is that in classic Hollywood, audiences must have been allowed enormous freedom, for surely today no actors would be allowed to use so broad an accent.  It was like watching a Ken Loach movie, whwre three quarters of the time you frankly can't make out what the actors are saying, you just pick up cues by their body language or their grim expressions.  In this movie, I would say that Cameron Mitchell takes acting honors, while Glynis Johns, usually so sensuous, chic and modern, is badly miscast as the prim, ignorant, straitlaced pioneer lass who yearns only to learn to read and later, to make sure her children are placed in good homes.  If this was really her plan, she sure chose a feeble way to ensure it would happen.

SPOILERS AHEAD.  The children are surrounded by horrible adults taken out of a Sinclair Lewis vision of American life, so that when their parents die one by one, so that the oldest boy is 12 when he and his five younger siblings are orphaned, he must somehow find places to lodge them, going around in the dead of winter with kids on his sleigh, begging the horrid neighbors to take them in one by one.  This part I imagine if I was a little boy in the 1950s, and I was watching this in the movie theater, I would find utterly sad, but as an adult I just wondered how they were going to make this feasible.  They just changed it around so that the adults are all now sweet and helpful, eager to assist young Robbie and to adopt even the plainest and most backward of the kids.

I kept thinking what would really happen if this was real life.  We know the frontier was not a nurturing place for children, and that sixty per cent of them died before the age of 14.  Unfortunately some of these children would become pawns in the expanding sex trade of Wisconsin, while others would just perish in the snow.  Now that's a tragedy.  But the movie says, based on a true story, and when that happens, you know they have maybe 1 per cent true story and the rest Hollywood hackery.

END OF SPOILERS.

Patty McCormack plays the same part as she played in THE BAD SEED, she's Rhoda Penmark all over again, bossing around the unfortunate children in her care.  She must be the only child in the movie who went on to do anything else?  Although some have said that the boy who played on LASSIE is also in this film.  The one with the freckles was probably sacrificed by some cult as being cursed with the mark of Cain.",1200009600,,3119,4.37261698440208

I had never heard of or seen this movie before, or heard of the book about the same entitled ""The Day they Gave Babies Away"".  As the movie went on I couldn't stop watching it.  I ended up watching the whole thing while on the tredmill.  This movie just captivated me and my emotions.  I didn't want to stop and miss it so I kept exercising.

What tough couragous people and children in those days!  Adults and children often died young and being there were no adoption agencies in the pioneer days... just neighbors helping neighbors, this kind of thing was common place.  For a 12 year old to be given the responsibility and shoulder the burden of placing his siblings with homes after his parent's death is something to be said of the quality of people in those days.  We can all learn a lesson in this story. I just can't fatham pulling my sister or brother around in a sled in the dead of winter trying to find them a good home... following my dying mother's wishes.  That's a heavy burden for anyone let alone a 12 year old.  Just a good movie Christmas time or anytime. Not junk like some of the stuff out there.  This movie should be made available in DVD.

Even more unfortunate was that some portions became so loud that, at that volume level, they were almost ear-damaging. We abandoned this video, about halfway through it, because of that audio problem. Given the time frame, between when we made the purchase and viewed it, it's way beyond the returnable/exchangeable stage.",1524441600,,766,4.9
8061216,5,B0009I89V0,An inspiring true story of facing tragedy and conquering adversity.  From what I can tell online Dale Eunson faithfully tells of his father's struggles in dealing with the death of his parents and finding homes for his 5 siblings.  I wonder how many of today's 12 year olds could handle the situation as well as Robbie Eunson did.,1520467200,,330,4.672413793103448

8061220,5,B0009I89V0,"this is an old movie set in Wisconsin where I grew up. I remember watching it as a child. Someone mentioned it to me and I had to see it again. Tearjerker! Do not watch with less than one box of tissues. I knew the ending and I still was sobbing. As I was watching some outdoors scenes I was wondering how they got the Rockies moved to Fox Valley Wi. But the story line is sweet, very similar to what many families experienced in the late 1800's . The acting was like a play from the high school, what you would expect in a 1950's production. I would buy it again. I will watch it again. With all of it's flaws it was a good movie.",1508716800,,631,3.9763779527559056
