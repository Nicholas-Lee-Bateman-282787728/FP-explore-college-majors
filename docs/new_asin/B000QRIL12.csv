However, I found it to be somewhat shallow and lacking in depth, especially the interviews.  They were too short and lacked substance.  In its infancy Scientology was a very good thing which was preverted.  There are some things that have merit, but were not considered.  I think it would of been better if it had been a little more objective.  Moreover, I don't think that anyone would disagree that what it has become is not acceptable.",1213056000,3,586,4.696078431372549
