8739778,1,B017MPNX6I,"TERRIBLE!! First, of all, it appears as if it was shot by some random kid who was supposed to be a part of the movie and felt he had nothing better to do. Terrible quality and really simple and quite frankly, stupid idea behind the storyline. Teens get drunk and high... one owes the other money.. they fight.. parents involved.. the end. Blah. Do not waste your money or time.",1496448000,,377,4.4

8739781,4,B017MPNX6I,"I love seeing what directors and actors do when their heart is put into a project, no matter the budget. With ""Suck It Up Buttercup"", you can see the love.
A 'fly on the wall' perspective into this family's life in small town, rural Indiana. Taking place during the course of a day, a mother discovers that her so called regular life is not at all what she thought it was. Finding out that her husband has been covering up and  lying about their ""perfect"" daughters drug addiction, she takes action, doing what she can to manage her new reality. A wonderful indie film that would be appreciated by all film festival indie lovers.",1450569600,,629,4.517543859649122
