8158760,5,B000KRK7WE,"Human Desire' (Fritz Lang, 1954, 91')'''

Human Desire (1954) is a black-and-white film noir directed by Fritz Lang, and based on the novel La Bte humaine by mile Zola. Screenplay is by Alfred Hayes. Starring Glenn Ford, Gloria Grahame, Broderick Crawford. The story was filmed twice before: La Bte humaine (1938) directed by Jean Renoir and Die Bestie im Menschen (1920).

Railroad supervisor Carl Buckley (Broderick) gets fired from his job. He persuades his seductive wife to pay a visit to an important railroad customer in order to try to get his job back. When Buckley suspects that his sexy, younger wife Vicki (Grahame) has done more than just talk with the rich old magnate, he smacks her around. He then jealously stalks his rival, finally stabbing him to death in a train compartment. Locomotive engineer and Korean War vet Jeff Warren (Ford) observed Vicki in the vicinity of the murder, but shields her at the inquest, as she sets his pulse racing. The two begin an affair which is hard to keep quiet in such a small town. Vicki then starts scheming for Warren to kill her increasingly drunk and violent husband.

Critic Dennis Schwartz liked the look of the film and wrote, ""Penetrating and searing, Human Desire is a nagging allegory about the darkness of human motivation and the corruption of the soul, and of desperate characters who live unfulfilled lives. It's not one of Lang's great pictures (it becomes too heavy-handed in parts), but anything Lang does has a power that is hard to forget. This one entertains as a riveting melodrama."" Critic Dave Kehr wrote of the film, ""Gloria Grahame, at her brassiest, pleads with Glenn Ford to do away with her slob of a husband, Broderick Crawford...A gripping melodrama, marred only by Ford's inability to register an appropriate sense of doom.""

Fritz Lang's American period - he declined Nazi Propaganda Minister Goebbels' 1933 offer to become Reichsfilmdirektor and did not return to Germany from a journey abroad - was long considered inferior to his German films. Unjustly, as the French Cahiers du Cinma found in the late 1950s, and as this film alone proves, even though it is not his best.

8158761,5,B000KRK7WE,"""Human Desire"" (1954) is technically a remake of Jean Renoir's  ""La Bete Humaine""  (1938), which featured Spencer Tracy look-alike Jean Gabin and Simone Simon; which itself was an adaptation of French Naturalist writer Emile Zola's novel.  But director Fritz Lang takes his version in an entirely different direction, turning the story from psychological thriller to film noir masterpiece by focusing on the two-timing woman (Vicki Buckley - played by Gloria Grahame).

Renoir's  ""La Bete Humaine"" had instead focused on exploring the mind of Gabin's protagonist (Lantier); specifically his genetic curse of brutality and rage.  His occupation of train engineer and the images of train tracks are used to reinforce the inevitability of his fate.

In Lang's version this character (Jeff Warren - played by Glenn Ford) has no dimensionality, the train tracks reinforce his straight and narrow nature, he is not bent and his train engine must be placed in a roundhouse to be given a different direction.

There are intersecting tracks in the train yard and Jeff's moral compass is only challenged in that location. The film's two most suspenseful sequences occur in the train yard and Lang amplifies the discordance with disorienting changes of camera angles and at one point an expressionistic jump-cut as Jeff and Vicki suddenly bridge the distance between each other.

But this is Grahame's film; her all-time best performance and Lang's best work as an acting for the camera director. She gently teases this role, when others would fill it with overwrought melodrama.  Her Vicki Buckley is the most authentic and complex heroine/fatale of the Film Noir genre; perhaps of all cinema. The character is a canvas filled with shades of gray; at once manipulative, vulnerable, self-destructive, and haunting.  Much of Grahame's effectiveness is nonverbal and much of it derives from her physical qualities and inherent fragility.  All very fitting as Zola was the pioneer of literary naturalism.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1333670400,2,2038,5.25

8158763,4,B000KRK7WE,This movie is of great interest to fans of 1950s railroad operations.  The big star is an Alco FA-1 diesel locomotive.  There is a fair amount of rail action throughout the film...and the underlying sinister plots of blackmail and murder play out well.,1315526400,5,252,4.837209302325581
8158764,4,B000KRK7WE,"No question I am a film noir, especially a crime film noir, aficionado. Recently I have been on a tear reviewing various crime noir efforts and drawing comparisons between the ones that ""speak"" to me and those that, perhaps, should have been better left on the cutting room floor. The classics are easy and need no additional comment from me as their plot lines stand on their own merits.  Others, because they have a fetching, or wicked, for that matter, as here femme fatale to muddy the waters also get a pass. Some, such as the film under review from 1954, Human Desire, offer both those and, additionally, the pedigree of a story-line based closely on the work of 19th century French writer, Emil Zola (he of Dreyfus case fame), and directed by German expressionist film director, Fritz Lang, with his flare for great and dramatic use of black and white cinematography. This film while not right up there with the top of the line Out Of The Past, Gilda and The Big Sleep, partially for chemistry factors between the lead characters and heaviness of plot line in places, is just a notch below. In other words you had better take an hour and a half and watch this thing.

A little summary of the plot line is in order to set the stage. Obviously Zola's work was set in 19th century emerging bourgeois society France rather than 1950s post- World War II red scare America. But the tale he had to tell of thwarted love. love gone wrong, love never on the right track, and in the end, a cautionary tale of how far certain people will go, dare I say even to murder, sums up the range of human conditions, when the human body heat is up. And the body heat rising here is nothing less than sexual desire. Of course. Simply said a certain femme fatale, a certain speedy femme fatale as it turns out, played by 1950s B-movie fixture, Gloria Grahame, tired of trying to make do behind a cigarette counter does what any girl would do in the situation, marries a ""big lug,"" a railroad middle-level management big lug guy who loves his booze, played by Broderick Crawford (he of All The King's Men fame), in order to get out from under. But speedy femme fatales are not built for the slow, big lug life, especially when they have a little past, a little past as they always do, here as a former, maybe former, mistress of a Mayfair swell. Needless to say he, as the plot unrolls and big lug Crawford proves to be less a catch than anticipated,  gets jealous when he finds out that said wifey has two-timed him. And big lugs know only one way, or seem to know only one way too deal with their two-timing wives, kill the lover, naturally, kill him here right in front of wifey and make her complicit in the murder, holding a certain piece of evidence to put the frame on her, put the frame on her big time, if she crosses him.

All of that is so much lead-up to the real story though. Two-timing femme fatales, whether they got their start behind a candy counter, a hat-check counter or cigarette counter, do not survive in this wicked old world without being primo man-traps. Man-traps that can wrap a guy, wrap a guy tight, very tight, and get him to do anything, anything at all, including, dare I say it, murder. Enter one returning Korean War GI, played by Glenn Ford, who on returning home to small-town Anytown, U.S.A. just wants to wash the grit of that experience off and continue his prior work as a railroad engineer moving goods and passengers along the quickly declining rails of 1950s America. And dream the dream of finding a good woman and grabbing a slice of the little white house with a picket fence, 2.2 kids and a dog, named Rover, probably. And, of course, she is there in the background.

But enter one two-timing femme fatale trying to get out from under a possible murder rap, out from under a loser husband, and who, well, looks like she might be a very nice little adventure, a very nice little adventure, indeed, especially once Glenn gets a whiff of that perfume, lights that cigarette, and takes dead aim at those ruby red lips (I assume they are ruby red, this is after all a black and white noir). Ya, she has him hook, line and sinker. Has him that is until ""crunch time."" Then we shall see.

Naturally, in these crime noir melodramatic plots the need to put a big gap between good and evil is usually served up by there being a ""good girl"" counterposed to the femme fatale. That is the case here and is, in the end what stops old Glenn from going over the edge. But still I blame Glenn for most of the problems here. Yes, sure I wouldn't have minded taking dead aim at those Grahame lips, who could blame a guy, a small town America guy, especially once she put on the full-court press with that cooing voice. Whee! But see Glenn has already been down this road before. He played Johnny to Rita Hayworth's Gilda in the 1946 movie of the same name so he knows, or should be presumed to know, what happens when you take dead aim at those femme fatale lips. Here's the ""skinny"" though- average joes, very average train engineer joes included, should keep fifty yards, no fifty miles, away from blonde (although they are not always blondes) femme fatales when they get that ""come hither"" look in their eyes.  You have been warned.",1311379200,2,5249,4.455775234131114
8158765,3,B000KRK7WE,"WARNING: CONTAINS PLOT DETAILS

Overall, in flight, this film is less than convincing, but it pulls off a surprisingly impressive entry into the water. The reason is that Fritz Lang suddenly turns a somersault - or his plot does - and the moral bearings the viewer has comfortably settled into are dumped on his head right at the end. The Glenn Ford character is transformed from nice war veteran-careless lover-murder conspirator, who sees the light, to a heel, who leaves a woman in fear of her life to the ministrations of her murderous husband. The woman, played by the excellent Gloria Grahame, turns from amoral seducer-adulterer to a feminist statement of ruined girl trying and failing to get the world's hypocrisy off her back. Her death is more like a suicide. All of this occurs in the last five minutes, so it is as if Lang has been playing a game with his audience, or it's an act of subversion he needed to slip past the producers/studio, who thought they were getting bad-girl-nearly-but-not-quite-ruins-good-boy. As film noir? Well, by the 1950s the genre had gone rather grey, and so is this example. As a suspense, it has passages of good plotting but then steps off the gas and meanders. An odd film, only made interesting because of the subversive contortions of a director who had done it all before, and wasn't content with a swan dive...",1296604800,,1360,4.787234042553192
8158766,4,B000KRK7WE,"""Human Desire"" was adapted to a contemporary setting from Emile Zola's 1890 novel ""La Bete humaine"". Director Fritz Lang represents its human encounters and entanglements as an omnipresent web of criss-crossing train tracks. Jeff Warren (Glenn Ford) has just returned to his old job as a railway engineer after 3 years at war in Korea. Carl Buckley (Broderick Crawford) works in the same rail yard until his violent temper costs him his job. But Carl knows that his wife Vicki (Gloria Grahame) is acquainted with a Mr. Owens, whose influence could get him his job back. Carl begs Vicki to ask Mr. Owens for the favor. She reluctantly consents, but Carl's violent temper rears its ugly head again when he suspects that Vicki traded sexual favors for his job.

Carl seems always to push his wife into the arms of other men and then blame her. Vicki is a calculating woman, at the same time victim and femme fatale, who sees no alternative but to try to turn her frustrating circumstances to her advantage. They deadlock when Carl uses a letter that would implicate Vicki in murder to hold her hostage in their marriage, and she retaliates by refusing him any affection. Meanwhile, Vicki has bewitched the one witness who might incriminate her, Jeff Warren, into falling in love with her. Although Jeff is the ""noir protagonist"" in this film, a man caught between his own desires and what's good for him, he is not the strongest character, so his predicament does not drive the film.

Vicki and Carl, both unattractive characters, propel the story. Where Carl's inability to conceal or control his anger are his undoing, Vicki's emotions are equally strong but kept bottled, sublimated into her machinations. Beyond the base characterizations of these two villainous types, the way ""Human Desire"" views Vicki is interesting. This film was made in 1954, and it goes out of its way to portray the adulteress in the worst light possible, worse than that of the murderer. Vicki seems to be cast in a harsher light than her actions merit. I put this down to post-war misogyny and fear of sex. Vicki is neither as cunning nor as successful as the femme fatales of the previous decade. She usually just does the obvious, but self-preservation with a sexual twist is enough to condemn her here.",1278547200,,2283,4.821428571428571
8158767,4,B000KRK7WE,"ATTENTION film purists: Please don't tell me this is not as good as Jean Renoir's 1938 La Bete Humaine starring Jean Gabin and Simone Simon. Let's agree to accept that as a given.

However, looking at Fritz Lang's Human Desire from 1954 on its own merits, I think the film is well directed, perfectly cast, well paced and entertaining. It stands up even in the jaded 21st century.

Glenn Ford and Broderick Crawford deliver the goods with strong although admittedly one dimensional performances. However, Gloria Grahame [Hollywood's queen of the tramps]steals the show with a carefully nuanced depiction of the bad girl trapped in a bad marriage with an abusive and menacing guy. She needs to be strong yet vulnerable; repellingly slutty yet attractively sensitive; despicable yet sympathetic. She is walking a dramtic tightrope for 90 minutes and she pulls it off!

I enjoyed the ride and the film improves with repeated viewings. I recommend it as a must see for film noir aficionados.
