7968692,5,B00006HAXX,"Since this is the second series for this cartoon I presume you readers already aware of this series.  This is basically a very raunchy, yet entertaining cartoon depicting some very unlikely junior high kids engaging in crazy stuff such as flashing, cross-dressing, SM, and general trouble making.  This is over the top toilet humor which will definitely offend most people.  If you enjoy Beavis &Butthead you will definitely enjoy this one, starting with the first tape ""Make way for the ping pong club"".
The second series features 4 stories.  The first one story is about the group's journey to a summer retreat, where the ping pong club group gets to meet some liberal college girls.  I did not find this segment that funny.  The second story is about the group playing against this team of grandma's, and it contains one of the few female nudity shots, but this is definitely not fan-service.  Come to think of it this is deeply disturbing.  The third episode features the group trying to win the HS ping pong tournament.  The forth episode of this video, Love and Comedy, is the funniest of them all.  This video is a must-buy just for the last story alone!",1006732800,,1161,4.731343283582089
7968693,5,B00006HAXX,"The twisted humor of the boys Ping Pong Club continues onto a second video, where the boys find more time to scare female classmates, ride panda bears, and strive to win Kyoko's ""sex pass"".
""The Curse of  Takeda"" takes the Club to summer camp, and the ghost of a young woman  mistakes Takeda for her long-lost lover.  Will he end up in his grave  before he even makes it to high school?  Will Maeno and Izawa ever stop  tormenting the young women at the camp with the sight of their  unmentionables?
""The Burning Spirit"" leads the boys into  another adventure, motivated by Kyoko's ""unique incentive.""  Team  Sponser Shibazaki pyschs the boys up for a match of pong against some  ""older women"" - but he neglects to mention how MUCH older!  Can  the boys survive the sight of senior citizen women changing their clothing  in the playing room?
""The Lost Prize"" follows the boys into the  final tournament against the other schools, but the prize is more than the  schools plan on.  Some are disqualified, some go on - who will be the one  to win Kyoko's pass?
""Love & Comedy"" - Takeda and Kyoko  agree to a first date.  They sneak around town trying to avoid the terrible  two (Maeno and Izawa), but those evil 8th graders seem intent on destroying  Takeda's chance to woo Kyoko.  A movie and a kidnapping?  Sounds like a  date!
If you enjoyed the first video, then you'll find more surprises and  sick jokes in the second one.  It's a hillarious series for anyone with a  twisted sense of humor, but if you're faint of heart - well, don't say I  didn't warn you!",928108800,,1561,4.494623655913978
