8274173,5,B0019K4YUC,"Please pay no attention to the star ratings.  Amazon does not permit reviews without marking that category.  I have not seen this film because it is only in Spanish and has no subtitles.  Since most foreign films do have subtitles, I did not check this out beforehand.  My fault.  This film, or at least this version, is intended for Spanish speakers.  When I ordered it, there were no reviews alerting me to this fact.",1219536000,8,419,4.594594594594595
