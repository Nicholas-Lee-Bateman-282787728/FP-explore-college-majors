2840506,4,B000QUEQ72,"These first 2 seasons of DYNASTY are compellingly exceptional and takes me back to memory lane to when I used to watch DYNASTY every Wednesday night at 10PM right after FALL GUY at 9PM, and GREATEST AMERICAN HERO at 8PM back in the Fall of 1981 thru the Summer of 1982.

It was also interesting seeing Pamela Sue Martin go from being Nancy Drew on THE HARDY BOYS to becoming the often bitter Fallon Carrington on DYNASTY and having Heather Locklear join the cast as Krystle's greedy niece  ( Sammy Jo Dean ) and Joan Collins as Blake's wicked ex-wife  (Alexis Carrington )in DYNASTY's 1981-82 Season in the Autumn of 1981 when this show hit its stride.

As a matter of fact, this was the show that made Heather Locklear a star and helped launch Locklear's showbiz career to co-starring future shows like TJ HOOKER, MELROSE PLACE, and SPIN CITY.

These first 2 seasons of DYNASTY also take me back to memory lane to when Ronald Regan was president and we had all those budget cuts from the recession we had back in 1981-1982.

It was also great being able to watch DYNASTY complete & uncut just like they were on ABC as opposed to how the episodes are shown on Pop-TV with all those butchered scenes and additional commercials.",1456358400,,1226,4.55

2840576,2,B000QUEQ72,"Has been getting worse each season since 4. The writing shows no imagination, and it is so unbelievable that it has become an effort to sit through each show.  I really enjoy the ""serial"" format, but this is just awful. There are so many better choices out there. This is the last season I'll buy.",1398988800,3,297,4.4
2840577,5,B000QUEQ72,"Season 7 is really a big problem, the storylines rewritten several times, major charakters written out because of the dumb politics the producers representated. They fired pregnant original character Pamela Bellwood, and replaced Catherine Oxenberg with an actress without any talent. The ratings immediately went downhill and nobody really cared about the show anymore...
The picture quality in this region 1 version is absolutely stunning, fantastic remastered.",1398038400,,463,5.925373134328358

2840580,5,B000QUEQ72,I loved the series Dynasty then and I have not lost my zeal for it now.  I enjoy going back to all the lavishness and the story lines and the entire cast leaves you aching for more regardless of how many times you see it over and over. I am a die hard fan of the Dynasty series and Knots Landing series that have fallen into days gone by. Owning them all brings them back and if your a fan too you will not be disappointed.,1392249600,,423,3.9186046511627906
2840581,4,B000QUEQ72,"Ah-Dynasty. This is your true, blue classic guilty pleasure from the 1980's. It is pure escapism and nothing but. The clothes are fantastic and the story lines are over the top, but still enjoyable. At least they were still believable at this time.
Overall, if you're into guilty pleasures, trashy sort of stuff, pure fluff and pure trips of escape and entertainment, there is no reason you won't like this show or in particular this season.",1390780800,,441,4.815789473684211

2840601,5,B000QUEQ72,"Overall I liked the Seventh Season so far.
Didn't have any problems with the CDS of Vol 1 but had problems with the first CD of Vol 2.
The disc must have been damaged as it started to freeze up while playing.
This is very annoying and hopefully the other 2 discs of Vol 2 are alright.
This isn't the first time that this has happened. I've had problems with Dallas, Falcon Crest, and Dynasty with damages to the CDS.
There appears to be a serious problem with Quality Control in the manufacturing of these CDS and do you think this issue could be addressed?",1377561600,,557,4.314285714285714

2840617,2,B000QUEQ72,"Well I love Dynasty - its still the best soap opera that was on tv but just  like any long running series its bound to loose steam- I don't know - I cant seem to get thru each eposiode- the story lines are dull and now that Alexis has the mansion and Blake and Krystal are living in a hotel, the glamour seems to be gone - And Alexis living in that huge mansion almost alone except for Ben - Blakes evil brother- it lasted for 2 more seasons after this one but its definitley winding down- if you are a big Dynasty fan its nice to add this to your collection but its really not the same - Even Amanda is being played by someone else after the first Amanda got fired from the series and alot of the series regular stars are gone. My opinion Seasons 1- 5 were the hey day of Dynasty---  just sayin ------..........................",1376524800,2,828,4.20125786163522

Anyway twenty years later I am watching the DVD of this show. I purchased the 7th Season and watched the entire season in under 2 weeks. How is this possible you ask, well one thing is no commercials and the 2nd thing these shows are 42 to 44 minutes long.  So each evening when I came home I had my nightly dose of Dynasty.
I only wish I could purchase the remaining Seasons. Guess I will have to wait till 2014 for Season 8.",1376006400,,544,4.08411214953271
2840623,3,B000QUEQ72,"DYNASTY is the  one and only night-time soap opera that I have ever watched and I have always loved it, which is why I buy each season as soon as it comes out on DVD.  Even though many people have said that the quality of the writing lagged in some of the later seasons, I still enjoy the series immensely.

Last night I finished watching the final episode of season 7.  For the most part, I enjoyed it.  The one thing that interfered is the fact that some of the disks I received stopped and / or ""froze"" during play.  I had to hit the search button on my remote in order to make the DVD start playing again.

Even though Amazon offers this disk at a lower price than say Critics Choice Video or Movies Unlimited, I feel that Amazon should have done a better job ensuring that these DVD's are flawless.  This is why I rate the purchase 3 stars out of 5.",1375660800,,854,4.133333333333334

2840637,5,B000QUEQ72,It has always been my favorite nightime serial. Season 7 is great because it features Alexis bitchy sister Caress. Also has Alexis in a catfight with Dominique. One serial you can watch over and over. Highly reccommended.,1374451200,,221,5.0

2840640,5,B000QUEQ72,"Fans have been waiting nearly a year to hear of the news that ""Dynasty-The Complete Seventh Season"" will be made available on July 9th, 2013. Paramount seems to be following a pattern, thankfully, of releasing the series anually, and with the fact that seasons 8 and 9 are already available in the U.K. and other countries it will only be a matter of time before the complete library of ""Dynasty"" episodes will FINALLY be put onto DVD for posterity.

 Season 7 deals with the news that Claudia (played by original cast member Pamela Bellwood) has died in a fire that Blake may have had a hand in, the repercussions of Alexis taking control of the Carrington mansion and Denver/Carrington, the campy and elegant British actress Kate O'Mara joining the cast as Alexis' long-lost sister Caress who has spent years in prison due to Alexis which ignites a feud between the two sisters, the arrival of the Fallmonts and their involvment with the Carringtons, the love story between Adam and his former sweetheart Dana (played by Emmy-winng actress Leanne Hunley for her role on ""Days of Our Lives"") and a super ending with Alexis life in danger and the Carrington's being held captive at the mansion by a former character who everyone thought had died.

 Season 7 is great fun with some intelligent plot twists, lots of sexy men for people to enjoy looking at, the women are dressed divinely and ""Dynasty"" proves that although the series wasn't nearly as popular as it once was (the series finished at #24 with a 17.2 Nielsen Rating for the 1986-1987 TV Season) loyal viewers stuck with it.

 The only argument I have about this particular year was the lackluster writing the powers that be had for Diahanne Carrol and her character Dominique. They quietly wrote her off the series and completely forgot about her in subsequent seasons. There was also the terrible recasting of Amanda by Karen Cellini who couldn't act her way through a school play let alone a TV soap opera. Catherine Oxenberg, the original Amanda and a beautiful and superb actress, had asked Aaron Spelling for a $1000 a week pay rise and he fired her!

 This season set contains all season 7 episodes (28) and are also available in 2 separate sets.

2840645,4,B000QUEQ72,"By now most Dynasty fans who are interested in buying the series have already bought season one. But for those who haven't this is a pretty slick marketing ploy to get the fans to buy season one. By simply no longer offering season one by itself, but packaging it with season two is a clever way to sell season one which did so poorly in the ratings. In the first season Blake marries Krystal but he still believes Krystal is in love with Matthew Blaisdell. That belief causes Krystal some problems when she pawns her jewelry to help Matthew out of a financial problem. Blake's driver, Michael, becomes his personal spy when he starts giving him tibbits of info that worsens Blakes trust for Krystal. Claudia becomes involved with Steven. Fallon is messing around with Michael, Lindsey, Claudia's and Matthew's daughter, is embarrassed by her mother because Claudia had lost her mind and wind up in a mental institution. And Steven was living openly as a gay man. The season ends with Blake accidentally killing Steven's former lover, Ted Dinard, which puts Blake on trial for his murder. This brings the season to a climactic end when Fallon's and Steven's mother shows up to take the witness stand. At this point no one knew who was going to play Alexis. Everyone know by now that ""Alexis Morrell Carrington"" played by Joan Collins was introduced in the very first episode of season two, which skyrocketed Joan Collins to the highest fame she's ever had since her career as an actress began. Season two was the season that she became engaged to Cecil Colby but she didn't marry him until season three, on his death bed. From the start ""Alexis"" was the hit of the show. Without her ""Dynasty"" may have crashed and burned. In season one we are introduced to most of the main core characters, who remains throughout most of the show, including Blake Carrington, Krystal Carrington, Fallon Carrington Colby,(she marries Jeff Colby so that his uncle would bail her father out of a financial jam, unknown by Jeff. Pamela Sue Martin originated the role, then left after season four. The role was then continued by actress Emma Samms until the end of the series.) Steven Carrington, (first played by Al Corley and then Jack Coleman took over the role until the series was over. Al Corley did return in ""Dynasty: The Reunion"" to finish up some left over storylines.) and Jeff Colby. In season two the show heats up and feuding between Krystal and Alexis begins, with such goings on as Alexis firing a gun, causing Krystal to lose her baby, Krystal and Alexis have their first fight, Claudia Blaisdell tries to do away with herself, bringing in the character Nicholas Tuscany (played by actor James Farentino)a psychiatrist who is secretly holding a grudge against Blake for allowing his brother to die in prison. He tries to wreck Blake's life. First he gets involved with Fallon, who by that time was pregnant. He also tries to seduce Krystal, which almost happened. Alexis digs up Krystal's former husband who wasn't her former husband but still her husband, which she didn't know about. After Blake finds out about Alexis's causing Krystal to lose their baby he threatens to kill her, causing her to seek revenge by accepting Cecil Colby's marriage proposal. As the season climaxes Blake and Nicholas are out riding when Blake's horse is spooked by a snake and Blake is knocked out and Nicholas just rides away. A storm is coming in and he is unconscious. Last but not least, Krystal former not former husband shows up, courtesy of Alexis. The fans has to wait until season three to see what happens with that.",1348012800,,3605,4.7696

The shows are so good that I can't wait for the 5th Season.  Unfortunately, the last Season to come out was the 4th Season.  Anyway, the show really became interesting once Joan Collins appeared on the scene as Blake's ex-wife, Alexis Carrington.  What a woman.  She's beautiful, sexy, cold-blooded, calculating, sophisticated and exceptional as the evil villainess.  On the other hand, Linda Evans is the intelligent, sexy, gorgeous, kind-hearted yet always stands up for herself and always stands up for what's right Krystal Carrington whom no one could help but love.  Krystal and Alexis are always exciting to watch when they interact.  Whenever they get together, boy do the sparks fly.  You can't go wrong buying the entire Dynasty series because this was one of the best, well acted shows to ever hit the TV screen.  The actors are all exceptional and bring their characters to life.

2840667,4,B000QUEQ72,"The ABC Network's answer to the hugely-popular primetime soap ""Dallas"", DYNASTY was created by Esther and Richard Shapiro to be the most flamboyant, daring and outrageous of all night-time drama series.  The lives of Denver's oil-rich Carrington family unfolded each and every week to the fascination of viewers all over the world, who couldn't get enough of their scandalous private affairs.

The second batch of episodes from Season Four kicks off with Alexis' (Joan Collins) outrageous ""country-western cabaret act"", in which she dances a hoedown with a prospective new invester and drapes herself over a chair to sing ""The Boys in the Backroom""; later retiring to her hotel room with ""Dex"" Dexter (Michael Nader) where they make sweet, sweet love in the shower.  Just another day in the office.

Kirby's (Kathleen Beller) nightmare pregnancy continues as she starts to suffer from severe hyper-tension and migraines.  Adam (Gordon Thomson) finally comes clean about the rape to Blake (John Forsythe) and the rest of the household.  Fallon (Pamela Sue Martin) falls under the spell of Eurotrash slime-bucket Peter De Vilbis (Helmut Berger); and Krystle (Linda Evans) explores the possibilities of falling pregnant.  A racehorse co-owned by Krystle and Peter mysteriously vanishes from the Carrington estate following a victorious race, and Claudia (Pamela Bellwood) receives notes signed ""Lancelot"" - the nickname she gave to her presumed-dead first husband Matthew.

New characters:  Diahann Carroll makes her dazzling entrance as Dominique Deveraux in the second-to-last episode ""New Lady in Town""...DYNASTY finally has it's black bitch!  It's game on when Alexis and Dominique lock horns from their very first scene together.  Sadly this is also where DYNASTY fans had to say a most reluctant farewell to Pamela Sue Martin's Fallon.  Although Emma Samms later gave the role a whole new angle (Fallon returns towards the end of Season Five with Ms Samms as the new 'face' of the wayward Carrington daughter); to most hardcore DYNASTY fans there's really only ever been one true Fallon.

2840670,5,B000QUEQ72,"The ABC Network's answer to the hugely-popular primetime soap ""Dallas"", DYNASTY was created by Esther and Richard Shapiro to be the most flamboyant, daring and outrageous of all night-time drama series. The lives of Denver's oil-rich Carrington family unfolded each and every week to the fascination of viewers all over the world, who couldn't get enough of their scandalous private affairs.

In the debut season, we first meet oil magnate Blake Carrington (John Forsythe), the tough but fair CEO of Denver-Carrington, as he's preparing to marry former secretary Krystle Jennings (Linda Evans). The show's opening story, ""Oil"", is spread over three episodes and sets up the characters and plots that would unfold throughout the season.

Sweet-as-pie Krystle is met with all-out resentment by Blake's stuffy butler (SORRY, ""major domo"") Joseph, played to perfection by Lee Bergere, and the staff follow suit. Meanwhile, Blake's grown children are causing their own headaches. Wild child Fallon (Pamela Sue Martin) proudly admits to bedding half the players on Carrington's football team and is also carrying on with studly chauffeur Michael (Wayne Northrop). In the midst of all the bed-hopping comes a tantalising deal from Blake's chief rival Cecil Colby (Lloyd Bochner): if Fallon marries Cecil's nephew Jeff (John James, of the quizzical expressions and upturned eyebrows), he'll absorb the $9.5 million debt owed by Blake and help the continued association between Denver-Carrington and ColbyCo.

Blake's son Steven (Al Corley) is another kettle of fish altogether. Returning to Denver after spending a year in New York with his...da-da-dum...gay lover Ted (Mark Withers), Steven's relationship with his father (and sexuality) goes through some particularly bumpy patches, to say the least. Steven was the first regular gay character on a soap and broke many boundaries.

On the other side of the social divide we find the middle-class Blaisdel clan. Matthew (Bo Hopkins) was kicked out of the Middle East, where he managed oil wells belonging to Denver-Carrington. Lovely wife Claudia (Pamela Bellwood) has suffered a breakdown and spent a long spell in a mental institution, and daughter Lindsay (Katy ""New Adventures of Heidi"" Kurtzman) spends all her time looking like she's on the verge of bursting into tears. Yawn. Audiences didn't really enjoy their involvement in the show, and the Blaisdel family was written out after the first year, except for good ole ""Crazy Claudia"" who provided lots of value in some of DYNASTY's best storylines in the years to come.

And what of the legendary Alexis (Joan Collins)? Well, you'll have to stick out the entire first season before she makes her dazzling entrance as the surprise witness in the last episode. Starting in Season 2, Alexis makes pulls no punches in her vendetta against Krystle and the war on Denver-Carrington. The show is still enjoyable without Alexis, but the last few episodes seem to drag a lot in their build-up to her arrival.

Season One includes the following:
Disc 1: Oil (Parts 1, 2 & 3)
Disc 2: The Honeymoon / The Dinner Party / Fallon's Wedding / The Chauffeur Tells a Secret
Disc 3: The Bordello / Krystle's Lie / The Necklace / The Beating
Disc 4: The Birthday Party / The Separation / Blake Goes to Jail / The Testimony

The second season opens with the arrival of Blake's first wife Alexis Carrington as the surprise witness in Blake's murder trial. The one thing missing from the first season of DYNASTY was a real villainess, and Joan Collins' casting as the scheming Alexis gave the show a much-needed shot of adrenaline. Whether she's rolling around on the floor with Krystle or rolling in the sheets with Blake's rival Cecil Colby, Alexis is a complete one-of-a-kind soap creation, an almost epic combination of old school wicked witch and one-woman demolition derby. Did I mention the delicious studio catfight between Krystle and Alexis? It's a doozy.

Claudia Blaisdel awakens in the hospital to discover that Matthew has skipped the country with their daughter Lindsay, and is later pimped and blackmailed by Cecil into stealing valuable documents from Denver-Carrington. Things really go to pot when Claudia and Krystle struggle over a gun and Claudia's brain is literally shot to pieces - here comes ""Crazy Claudia""!

Fallon and Jeff break up, and make up...then break up some more...but in between they manage to conceive little Blake Junior who is born premature after Fallon was involved in an auto accident. Nurse Susan (Christine Belford, aka ""Wonder Woman""'s duplicitous Baroness von Gunther) is assigned as the kid's nanny. Should have smelled a rat right there...

New characters: In addition to the amazing Alexis, Season 2 also boasts the arrival Dr. Nick Toscanni (James Farentino), a psychiatrist/sometime neurosurgeon with an axe to grind about the role Blake (John Forsythe) played in his half-brother's death, who quickly falls into bed with Fallon and causes a few temptations for Krystle as well! Krystle's ""gosh darn"" niece Sammy Jo (Heather Locklear) also comes to stay for a spell...looking for her own piece of the Carrington pie!

Season Two includes the following:
Disc 1: Enter Alexis / The Verdict / Alexis' Secret / Fallon's Father
Disc 2: Reconciliation / Viva Las Vegas / The Miscarriage / Mid-East Meeting
Disc 3: The Psychiatrist / Sammy Jo and Steven Marry / The Car Explosion / Blake's Blindness
Disc 4: The Hearing / The Iago Syndrome / The Party / The Baby
Disc 5: Mother and Son / The Gun / The Fragment / The Shakedown
Disc 6: The Two Princes / The Cliff",1277596800,13,5586,5.080697928026172

The last season of Dallas is being released now and they were on TV at the same time. I agree also that splitting the seasons into volumes is very unfair financially and the fact that I would like to have just one case per season.

Tame by today's standards, the show continually evolved over its 8-year run.  That being said, I hate the split sets from Paramount and hate the long waits between seasons.  At this rate, I'll be dead by the time the final season is released on DVD.  Another reviewer stated that Paramount is making the best possible DVD transfer plus they don't use double-sided dvds like Dallas.  I have both Dallas and Dynasty sets and have noticed that the Dynasty dvds are definitely clearer and the audio is more crisp, so maybe that's why it is taking so long.

NOT ONLY ARE WE PAYING DOUBLE FOR THE ENTIRE SEASON, BUT WE ARE WAITING FOREVER FOR THE REMAINING OF THE EPISODES TO BE RELEASED.

I ONCE CALCULATED THAT AT THE RATE THAT THE SEASONS ARE BEING RELEASED, MAINLY BECAUSE NOW THEY ARE BEING SPLIT INTO VOLUMES, WE MAY NOT COMPLETE THE LAST SEASON UNTIL 2014. BUT NOW THAT IT HAS TAKEN VOLUME 2 OF SEASON 4 LONGER THAN ANYBODY WANTED TO WAIT FOR ITS RELEASE, HAS PROBABLY PUSHED THE REMAINING SEASONS EVEN FURTHER INTO THE FUTURE.

WE WAITED LONGER THAN 2 YEARS FOR THE RELEASE OF SEASON 2. SEASON 3: VOLUME 1 FOLLOWED ABOUT 10 MONTHS LATER, WITH A SHORT WAIT OF 4 MONTHS FOR VOLUME 2. SEASON 4: VOLUME 1 THEN FOLLOWED UP ABOUT 6 MONTHS AFTER THAT. DOES THIS MEAN ON AVERAGE WE ARE GOING TO SEE EACH SEASON AND OR VOLUME RELEASED SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 4 TO 10 MONTHS APART. WE COULD STILL BE LOOKING AT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 2014 TO 2017 DEPENDING UP0N WHEN PARAMOUNT MAY DECIDE TO GET ON THE BALL.

THE LAST DYNASTY ORIGINAL EPISODE AIRED ON MAY 11, 1989. IT WAS A TWO-PARTER, WITH THE FIRST PART AIRING ON MAY 04, 1989. I WAS NOT HAPPY THAT MY FAVORITE NIGHTTIME SOAP OPERA OF ALL TIMES WAS PULLING INTO ITS FINAL DEMISE, WITH ALEXIS AND DEXTER BREAKING THROUGH A BANNISTER AND FALLING INTO.....

THEN WHEN DALLAS BEGAN BEING RELEASED ON DVD, DYNASTY FOLLOWED SUIT. EXCEPT DYNASTY HAS BEEN A WHOLE LOT SLOWER. I TOO HAVE NOTICED THAT DALLAS HAS RELEASED ALMOST ALL OF THEIR SEASONS. BY NOW AT LEAST THE 6TH SEASON SHOULD BE THE NEXT ONE AVAILABLE. ONLY TIME WILL TELL HOW MUCH LONGER WE ARE GOING TO WAIT.

WE WAITED 16 YEARS FOR DYNASTY TO HIT DVD. (WHO KNEW THAT THIS MEDIA WOULD EVEN BE AVAILABLE.) HOPEFULLY WE WON'T HAVE TO WAIT 30 YEARS SINCE THE SHOW LAST ORIGINALLY AIRED BEFORE ALL OF THE SEASONS ARE AVAILABLE. I HOPE TOO THAT ""THE COLBYS"" AND ""DYNASTY: THE REUNION"" THE MINI-SERIES ALSO BECOME AVAILABLE SOON.

AND HERES A LAST THOUGHT WISH: SINCE THE CORE ACTORS OF DYNASTY ARE ALL STILL VERY MUCH ALIVE, WOULDN'T IT BE NEAT TO HAVE A SERIES OF MOVIES, IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE CHARACTER ""PERRY MASON"" WAS LATER ON BROUGHT BACK FOR MORE THAN 30 MOVIES. I ENJOYED THOSE CAT FIGHTS BETWEEN KYSTLE AND ALEXIS. OKAY, SO THEY WERE YOUNGER. WHO CARES. ITS HOLLYWOOD. THEY WOULD FIGURE IT OUT. AND BY THE WAY, I HAVEN'T ENJOYED MUCH TELEVISION SINCE DYNASTY.

****************************UPDATE! UPDATE! UPDATE!******************************

I RECEIVED MY COPY OF ""DYNASTY"" SEASON 4: VOLUME 2 ON FEBRUARY 05, 2010. I COULDN'T WAIT TO WATCH THE REST OF THE EPISODES. MY BIGGEST GRIPE ABOUT HOW THIS SEASON ENDED WAS THE WAY FALLON AND KIRBY LEFT THE SHOW. KIRBY JUST SORT OF DISAPPEARS AFTER FAILING TWICE TO DO AWAY WITH ALEXIS. AND ADAM, AFTER LEARNING THAT SHE WAS LEAVING FOR PARIS,  REFERS TO HER AS ""DIRT"". AND FALLON HAS A HORRIFYING HEADACHE, WHICH HAS HER CHANGING OUT OF HER WEDDING OUTFIT, JUMPING INTO HER CAR AND SPEEDING OFF DOWN THE ROAD INTO OBLIVION, WITH JEFF IN HOT PURSUIT. OF COURSE FALLON WAS SUPPOSE TO GET AWAY SINCE PAMELA SUE MARTIN WAS LEAVING THE SHOW.

DIAHANN CARROLL MADE HER DEBUT AS ""DOMINIQUE DEVERAUX"", COMING IN AS A ""CARRINGTON"". OF COURSE NONE OF THE ""CARRINGTONS"" ARE YET AWARE OF THAT FACT. AND THE CHARACTER ""MARK JENNINGS"" IS KILLED OFF THE SHOW, BY FALLING TO HIS DEATH OFF OF THE BALCONY OF ""ALEXIS'S PENTHOUSE"". TRACY'S SCHEME WAS FINALLY FOUND OUT AND SHE NOT ONLY GETS KICKED TO THE CURB BY BLAKE, BUT SHE ALSO GETS SLAPPED BY KYSTLE.

LAST BUT NOT LEAST, ALEXIS LANDS IN JAIL FOR THE DEATH OF MARK JENNINGS. SHE IS BEAUTIFULLY DRESSED IN A LONG RED DRESS AND IS AT THE WEDDING OF FALLON AND JEFF WHEN SHE IS ARRESTED AND CARTED OFF TO JAIL. POOR THING. NOW WE JUST HAVE TO STAY TUNED TO SEE WHEN WE CAN GET TO FIND OUT ""WHO DONE IT?"" YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WE HAVE TO STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS BETWEEN THE CARRINGTONS AND THE COLBYS.

NOW WHEN CAN WE EXPECT TO SEE/GET SEASON 5? I HOPE BY THE END OF THIS SUMMER!!!!",1260230400,4,4079,4.549795361527967

2840706,3,B000QUEQ72,Well its about time!!!!!! I was seriously giving up on Dynasty. Its been so long since the release of vol. 1 of season 4. Im glad that Paramount is still releasing Dynasty but I wish they would stop releasing it in volumes and just release it in full seasons. At this rate we won't finish the series for years to come. We are only up to season 4????????? I mean we have like 5 more seasons to go. I guess Dallas is way more popular and that show lasted for like 13 years and they are almost finished releasing it all. Paramount please consider releasing the rest of Dynasty in full seasons. People will buy it. But if u keep doing it this way then people will get sick and tired and not buy anything!!!!!!!!,1257811200,16,707,4.2444444444444445

 CREO QUE SI LOS PRODUCTORES SE Deben A LOS clientes, Estos deberian hacer un Esfuerzo posible para Tener contenta a toda la clientela de Dinastia.

2840728,5,B000QUEQ72,"Finally, Paramount will be releasing ""Dynasty- Season 4 Volume 2"" in February, 2010. After a 10 month wait we ""Dynasty"" fans will be able to see what happens to Blake, Krystle, Alexis, and the rest of the Carrington clan since the last batch of episodes were released on DVD in April, '09. Still, despite the wait we fans should be thankful that Paramount is releasing these classic shows: look at the shoddy way Warners is treating ""Knots Landing"" fans! Only 2 seasons worth of episodes were released on that series and there is no word if any more will be available. Anyhow, this ""Dynasty"" set features the last 13 episodes that aired in the 1983-84 TV season. The series finished at a whopping #3 in the national Nielsen ratings, just behind the powerhouse ""Dallas"". In the next year ""Dynasty"" would solidify its place as the #1 rated show in the country knocking ""Dallas"" out of the top peg. In these last 13 shows the drama wasn't so much about what happened on the screen, but off. Many cast members were let go and some opted to leave of their own volition. Hunk Geoffrey Scott was served his walking papers as Mark Jennings fell off Alexis' terrace. She would eventually stand trial for his murder. Kathleen Beller was fired, as Kirby was sent packing back to Paris by Alexis and wouldn't be heard from again until the ""Dynasty"" miniseries in 1991. The biggest shocker this year was when Pamela Sue Martin went to Aaron Spelling and told him she wanted off the series as she felt portraying someone rich wasn't what she wanted to do any more. In reality Pamela wanted to do movies in which Joan Collins stated ""yeah! and what movies has she done since!"". Joan thought that Pamela quitting ""Dynasty"" was the most stupid thing she ever heard. She stated ""actors have the most precarious of professions. We are mostly out of work so when you get a hit series that makes you known and rich you should appreciate it."" Too bad Pamela didn't listen to her co-star's advice. Fallon would eventually meet her fate in a terrible car crash in the last episode. Another wonderful suprise this season was in the last two episodes when a chic, black mystery woman comes to Denver in the vein of Diahann Carroll who would play Dominique Deveraux. We wouldn't know what her purpose in Denver was until the following year, but keep in mind it is quite a shocker! Diahann actually named the character herself. When asked how she came up with the name Dominique, Diahann said, ""I found it in the phone book!"". I have to say that Diahann's portrayal is one of the most beautiful and glamourous of any actress I have ever seen in a primetime drama series. She really gives Joan Collins a run for her money. So sit back and enjoy these wonderful episodes of ""Dynasty"". Let's hope it doesn't take Paramount another 10 months to release season 5 on DVD.

 UPDATE ON APRIL 18, 2011...PARAMOUNT HAS JUST ANNOUNCED THAT ""DYNASTY"" SEASON 5 ARRIVES IN STORES JULY 5, 2011. THE ENTIRE SEASON COMES TO DVD, HOWEVER THE SEASON WILL BE SPLIT INTO HALF SEASON BOXSETS MEANING YOU CAN BUY THE FIRST HALF OF THE SERIES (15 EPISODES) INDIVIDUALLY AND THE LAST PART INDIVIDUALLY (14 EPISODES), OR BUY THE SEASON 5 SETS TOGETHER (ALL 29 EPISODES). THIS IS GREAT NEWS! THANKS TO THE FANS FOR DEMANDING WE SEE MORE ""DYNASTY"" ON DVD!!!!",1257465600,29,3302,4.6331058020477816
2840729,5,B000QUEQ72,"I was not allowed to watch this series when it was on in the early 80's; my parents would not permit it. However, a local cable station showed the series ten years later (early 90's) during a marathon. I watched every episode from the first few seasons. The first two seasons are the best ever, period! You can see Blake, Krystal, Fallon, Steven, Jeff, Claudia, and Alexis once again. I always felt sorry for Claudia (she was always losing her mind) and poor Steven was always in a miserable state. Pamela Sue Martin (Fallon) and Joan Collins (Alexis) always made the show. I just wish Paramount would hurry up and release all the seasons soon and stop the volume one and two stuff!!",1257206400,,683,4.560975609756097
2840730,5,B000QUEQ72,"I ordered this product during a night of boozing and had kind of regretted it... until I started watching it! Great to watch these early seasons, which I do not think I saw back in the day (I was 4 - 5). The first season is interesting with the dual story lines of the middle class and the Carrington/Colby families + Steven's homosexuality and Fallon's free wheeling ways (tasty references to an entire football team). And once Joan Collins comes in at the beginning of the second season...Sublime!",1247702400,,499,4.681818181818182

2840733,5,B000QUEQ72,"I bought this dvd out of curiosity as i was born just after Dynasty ended and never watched reruns, so i didn't know how this would be.
I really enjoyed watching it and loved the OVER-THE-TOP cliffhangers that made you wanna watch the next episode right away. Season 1 is pretty fun especially the last 3 episodes,i found the best. Season 2 is good as well with more over the top fun and the introduction of Alexis.
I ordered these together with Dallas for the same reason.
I watched Dynasty first and started watching the first episode of Dallas but it just didn't appeal to me, i like Dynasty much much better because, just like i've read in a forum, Dynasty knew that it was over the top so people were never outraged if something was just too weird or impossible but Dallas took itself seriously but didn't always make it.

Anyway good fun, and really long episodes, one episode is about 48-49 minutes just goes to show you how much commercials we are forced to watch nowadays",1231286400,,980,4.50561797752809
2840734,5,B000QUEQ72,"Thoroughly enjoyed Seasons 1 & 2.  I even looked at them a few more times before I ordered the rest of the collection.  Nobody has done it quite as well as the Carringtons and Colbys since.  If you watched the series when it was on TV, I recommend you buy the entire set.
