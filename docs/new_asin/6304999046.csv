8458598,5,6304999046,"If you want to see some true church folk praisin', roof shakin', pew turnin',and wall tremblin' gospel music, wait no longer.  This is it right here.  Although James could be a little long-winded and stretch a song out from here to kingdom come, this video is worthwhile.  One of the earliest videos for both James and Mississippi Mass, it is worship in the raw- no makeup, pretty robes and suits.  It is down-home, sweat-your-perm-out, and get-ugly-for-the-Lord praise.
