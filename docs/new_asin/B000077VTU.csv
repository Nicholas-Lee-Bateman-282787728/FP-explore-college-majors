Jason delves into issues of character and inspires listeners to think beyond themselves, beyond just this moment, and consider God's plan for the gift of sexuality.  We are building a Purity class at church and will use this as part of our teaching curriculum, along with his ""If You Really Loved Me"" book.  Great stuff.",1185062400,,419,4.873239436619718
7974350,5,B000077VTU,"My son & I watched this video and it is an excellent resource with a wonderful message! I guarantee you that if your child is attending a public school they are not being told the absolute Truth during their ""sex education"" courses. After seeing this video, I will never let my son be exposed to any type of sex education that advocates a so-called ""protection in case you decide not to say no"" philosophy. The only real way to protect your sons is to teach them the Truth about how God truly treasures them & that their lives are precious gifts to be protected. After watching this video they will understand what it means to truly respect women & that they do not have to follow the crowd & fall prey to every weakness they encounter. This message will empower them & lay the foundation for them to be good, honorable husbands in the future!",1123200000,,843,4.445161290322581
