This movie does not have an ending. It cuts to a black screen right after a fight. It doesn't include the ending credits. For all I know the hostage is still tied up back in the mansion.

Gambling Ghost
This movie is extremely vulgar. It shows the explicit thrusting of two people having sex. In more than one occasion shows a man slapping on the butt women who are passing by. Sammo Hung has a fake mold on his chin with a 4 inch hair growing from it. It shows the desecrasion of a grave stone and an ancestor's shrine. There's a close up of a guy picking his nose. Watching this movie was a very uncomfortable experience.

Burger Cup
This movie has two audio tracks that run at the same time, but it has a fix. One is decent, the other sounds really bad. I put my 6 speaker system to Bypass mode and disconnected one of the left speakers to eliminate one of the dialogue tracks. The soundtracks and the single dialogue worked fine with the fix.

Hidden Enforcers
This movie is a fun movie to watch. The video quality is the same as soap operas from the 90s. The story and action are not realistic.",1280620800,3,1117,4.309523809523809
