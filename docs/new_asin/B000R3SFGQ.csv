2858344,5,B000R3SFGQ,"I'll admit, I cringed a couple of times but I absolutely loved it!!! I have a great respect for body modification (I have multiple piercings and tattooes) and after watching this, I can't WAIT to get more. I am truly inspired by the strength and resolve of those leading the field. Kudos for having the courage to live outside ""the box.""",1324857600,7,337,4.540983606557377
2858345,5,B000R3SFGQ,This is a very well done documentary about all the different forms of body mods....ranging from tattoos & piercings all the way to gender changes. I would say that anyone in the industry should own a copy of this DVD.,1315440000,,217,4.45
2858346,5,B000R3SFGQ,"This is a phenominal documentary about body modification as well as the politics, philosophy and people behind it.  This documentary covers plastic surgery, piercing, tattooing, dermal/sub-dermal implants, scarification, branding, sex change/gener reassignment surgery and suspension.  Additionally, the documentary covers the politics behind body modification and many of the psycological aspects as to why people do it.  Many of the interviews are with professional body modifiers, performers, piercers and people who have gone to great lengths to change thier outward appearance.  It also talks about religion, social inclusion and how modifications got their start.

Many of the people who they interview may look very odd to the regular person, but when you hear them speak they are so philosophical, and their analysises are so deep and multidimensional.  Living in New York,I am used to seeing tons of people with the wildest body mods imaginable so it is not very shocking for me, but I think this documentary can teach alot of closed minded people about the inner workings of humanity and human desire to change who they are and to become more individualistic.  It also shows the depth and uniquness of human individuality and the human quest for self-acceptance vs social acceptance.

One definate warning, this film is VERY VERY graphic.  There is alot of blood and alot of disturbing images as many of the surgeries are shown.  Artists are shown giving people brandings and scarings.  I would say the most disgusting was seeing the process of a tongue splitting.  This documentary is not for the faint of heart and is definately for mature audiances.

I absolutely loved this documentary as it held nothing back and truly delved into the realm of real body mod.  I think that this movie would also be a great addition to any psychology, anthropology or sociology class.  This movie definately opens the mind to the extent that people go to, to love and accept themselves regardless of if society accepts them.  It definately shows how people struggle to find happiness and inner peace in ways that are unique and challenges the ideals of religion and society a a whole.

A last note... there is a discussion on the difference between modification and mutilation.. phenominal, deep analysis of the topic.

BUY THIS NOW!!!",1310947200,5,2332,5.140583554376658
2858347,5,B000R3SFGQ,"If you work as a tattoo artist or if you have even one tattoo or even a piercing this is a must watch. It is in a documentary type movie about all forms of modification from plastic surgery to voluntary removing body parts or drastically changing the ones you have, and yes it deals with many differnet ways of tattooing! I thought it was really awesome! I like to see the different ways people have come up with to modify your body. has some super crazy parts though! (penis splitting)",1299542400,3,486,4.411111111111111
2858348,5,B000R3SFGQ,"This is a really great documentary about very extreme body modification, featuring such favorites as Stalking Cat, the lovably huggable Bear, and a slightly arrogant seeming Lizard Man. This is, however, very graphic. Even I was squeamishly squeezing my legs together. It ranges from everything to implants (both breasts and horns), body building, full body tattoos, scarification, penis implants and splitting, transgendered surgery, and hook hanging. If you like documentaries about alt lifestyles, this is one to check out.",1285459200,,526,5.670886075949367
2858349,5,B000R3SFGQ,"This is a great, informative movie with interesting subject matter.  In fact I was so impressed with it I went to the manufacture's web site to see if it was available so I could add it to my library.  It was and for only $25, so I gave them my credit card information and address and eagerly awaited getting this gem.
Well, that was several weeks ago and I still haven't received the merchandise. I tried to visit their web site to inquire what was the delay only the learn the site has be ""suspended"".

If you're lucky enough to have a copy of Modify consider yourself fortunate.",1268611200,,581,4.361111111111111
2858350,4,B000R3SFGQ,"It isn't easy to believe but not so long ago a tattoo or an earring (on a man) was considered to be a sign that one was far outside the mainstream. These days, tattoos and earrings raise no eyebrows. It is probably not too surprising to find, therefore, that many people are now looking for more radical forms of body modification.

Modify is an interesting look at this trend. Viewers meet a man who has radically altered his appearance so that he looks just like a tiger. There is also extensive discussion of people who like to put metal hooks through their skins so that they can suspend themselves for long periods of time. The film delves into all sorts of body modification and it is seldom boring.

Potential viewers should be aware that Modify contains a lot of gore. I don't think that I am squeamish, but I spent large parts of this film looking away from the screen during the many surgery scenes. Also, a few of the ""modified"" people come across as narcissists who have relatively little to say; I was happy when Modify moved on from these people.

Modify is a great film for those who want to explore an interesting subculture. It is not, however, for the faint of heart.",1263686400,,1185,4.502325581395349
2858351,4,B000R3SFGQ,"this very interesting and visually disturbing documentary (with the theme: ""No one should dictate to me what I can and cannot do to my body"")
about a sub-culture of people who love and are seemingly addicted to body modification. it raises the question though is ""excess"" forms of modification, self mutilation?

it features interviews with people who have massive tattoos and piercings, who enjoy branding and cutting, people have genital beading, to tongue splits, those who enjoy suspension (being hung by metal hooks!!!)... to ""lesser"" modificaitons: people who have had plastic surgery done, transgender surgery, who cross dress or who bodybuild.

the most interesting person is a man (named stalking tiger--- his real name!) who has altered his body to the likeness of a tiger. he has an orange and black face tattoo, has gotten his ears pointedly shaped, work on his eyes have been done to give them a slanted effect, he has silver rods in the place of whiskers, his teeth and nails are long, sharp and cat-like.

the most painful modifications shown are: cutting and 3-d modification (basically branding). in cutting, the artist uses just a scalpel!!! and in 3-d modification, a sorta small blow torch. the customers getting designs done were shrieking and jerking around--- i FELT their pain!!!

its just very interesting. it may make you think of all the body modifications you may have/do and not realize it (hair coloring, teeth whitening, ear piercings...) and how thats different than someone who for example, has their face heavily pierced. is their a difference? who is ""more normal?"" despite the modification?

this documentary will DEFINITELY get you talking!!!",1193875200,18,1679,5.158088235294118
2858352,1,B000R3SFGQ,The film will only promote this sickness to other people.  My fear is that it will grow to our young viewers.,1396656000,,109,4.190476190476191
2858353,3,B000R3SFGQ,Went places I'm not sure I was ready for but was still interesting. Worth a watch if you can handle it.,1394755200,,103,3.9523809523809526
2858354,2,B000R3SFGQ,Interesting concept but would like to hear a more in-depth psychological reason why the characters wanted to change their appearances so drastically.,1389484800,,149,5.818181818181818
2858355,5,B000R3SFGQ,"Being into body modification, this DVD features some common and not-so-common modifications as well as some interviews from those having the modification, and those performing them.  Not for the squeamish or weak stomach, this DVD is graphic related to the modifications.",1386374400,,271,5.609756097560975
2858356,5,B000R3SFGQ,I thought that it was interesting that anyone would take a course of hurting their bodies to this extreme. It hurt to watch this happen to anyone. If you do watch this I would suggest no popcorn while watching it. Gross!,1386374400,,220,4.390243902439025
2858357,4,B000R3SFGQ,This documentary was very interesting and me very on edge at certain points as I was not used to some of the modifications that people to their bodies....I guess It is to each his own but it was unbelievable how far some of these people had gone....If you are looking for something different and are not afraid to see major body modifications then you might enjoy watching this. I watched it all the way through and got an education.,1380844800,,433,4.493670886075949
2858358,4,B000R3SFGQ,"This was a well written and directed documentary. It explores a wide range of body modifications and delves into societies perceptions and the individuals motivations for making their body different than the social norm. From body building, plastic surgery, and penis piercing this documentary has an overview and interview with the various publics involved. From medical professionals to people who look like animals or reptiles this documentary gains insider knowledge with thoughtful interviews. It has everything you look for in a documentary.",1380844800,,547,5.682926829268292
2858359,5,B000R3SFGQ,"As a heavily tattooed person I tend to get a lot of the same questions from people. Why? Did it hurt? Aren't you afraid of how people will treat you? etc....

I think that this documentary is a must watch for people who don't have tattoos or other body modifications. You will see some body modification procedures, but honestly it isn't anything that will scar you for life. This movie does a great job exposing the different facets of body modification, and I think it will help people understand that those who are modified don't all fit into the same category. It is definitely worth watching.",1378771200,,597,4.632075471698113
2858360,5,B000R3SFGQ,"Although not easy to watch at times, I couldn't look away. It changed my mind forever about people with tattoos and Piercings. Cool documentary and definitely out of the ordinary and very well done. I'd like to see more!",1376697600,,220,4.666666666666667
2858361,1,B000R3SFGQ,"Modify is a documentary about modifying private parts. We meet multiple personalities who give their reasons and experiencies. Its all sounds innocent till I asked myself what they actually added to society and obvious answer is nothing. Thats the point--as long as they modify their private parts mainstream media let them play mainstream useful idiots. And in a meantime the number of homeless is the same, crime rate never discussed and anything that may bother status quo never mentioned. Wonderful. Lets borrow another 10 trillion dollars and waste it. Wonderful. The movie itself is boring  and I guess producer should invite Troma team to make from it something like rocking and rolling.",1367625600,,694,5.196428571428571
2858362,1,B000R3SFGQ,Waste of my time watching graphic self mutilation. Did not watch all the way through because I was expecting at the most a decent storyline or at least a thoughtful documentary. I got neither.,1365811200,2,192,4.676470588235294
2858363,3,B000R3SFGQ,"I was shocked and horrified all the way thought it. I have always said you never have to make up anything in this world. Someone, somewhere is doing it.  I was compelled to keep watching from some sick part of me that was drawn to the bizare. I guess it is the same reason we watch horror movies. We get the adrenali rush without having to be part of the scene.

You better have a strong stomach for this one.  It is all the more disturbing because it is real.",1365033600,,460,4.088888888888889

2858365,1,B000R3SFGQ,This video is very graphic.  Don't watch it unless you don't mind having sick pictures in your mind for days.,1357084800,2,109,4.45

2858367,5,B000R3SFGQ,This video is very graphic and educational. I am a student in a mental health program and this video shows various perspectives on body modification. It is so graphic at some points it is gross but it is still done very well.,1352505600,,225,4.380952380952381
2858368,5,B000R3SFGQ,Exactly as i ordered it. brand new still in the plastic. Very satisfied! Shipping was very fast :) This is an amazing documentery and something i will always keep it in my library.,1346889600,,180,4.484848484848484
2858369,5,B000R3SFGQ,"Working with highschool age youth, I see a lot of the desire to modify bodies. This movie shows the extremes that people go to in changing their bodies and the people that are involved in the process. What amazed me was the fact that many of these modifications, though of a definate surgical nature, are done by people with no formal medical background. The movie goes into some areas that will make you cringe, but it does a good job of documenting the range of changes people make.",1335916800,3,484,4.511363636363637
2858370,5,B000R3SFGQ,this is one of the best movies i have ever seen & if you have an interest in becoming a piercer or anything to do with body modification it's definately worth watch. covers some very interesting procedures & asspects of piercing & body mods & has some great detail & information on how things are done.,1330819200,2,302,4.410714285714286

8198785,4,B000R3SFGQ,"This is a very graphic look at how different people modify their bodies.  It covers the topic thoroughly.  At the same time it is not lurid or sensational.  I would recommend that if you are researching modification for yourself, try to see how your chosen modification might look after 20 or 30 years.",1458172800,,302,4.660377358490566
8198786,4,B000R3SFGQ,"I watched this with the para medic and flight nurse in my crew, they kept whimpering over some of the graphic depictions of what people do to themselves.",1451347200,,153,4.5

8198788,5,B000R3SFGQ,LOVE this! I have watched it so many times and it was taken off of Netflix so I knew I needed to buy it. It came so quick and I was ecstatic when it arrived. By FAR one of the best I have ever watched on body mod!,1418083200,,213,3.4583333333333335
8198789,5,B000R3SFGQ,"A wonderful documentary. I was a little queasy at parts (they do show how many of the procedures are done) but it was defiantly worth the watch. I loved the sense of self possession of each person showcased. I am going to recommend this watch to all I know.

I feel like a picnic is order, though, to celebrate body modification. It should be held on a Sunday at three. Bring beer and sandwiches.",1407888000,,396,4.351351351351352
8198790,5,B000R3SFGQ,"A very interesting and informative documentary.  I was impressed by how articulate everyone was.  They came off as artists that really know their craft, not freaks and low lifes.  I will warn you that many parts were very hard to watch as they looked extremely painful.  Ironically, the most painful procedures looked to be the plastic surgery (brutal!) and cosmetic tattooing.  If you have thought about getting a tattoo or piercing, you should watch this first.  If you have them already, you may get some new ideas.",1405728000,,518,4.896551724137931
8198791,5,B000R3SFGQ,"The movie is a little old, but the subject is so current! It has appearances from well know professionals of the body modification industry and it helps us understand the different types of modifications out there. It is not so frequent to find material covering genital modification, scarifications and other techniques, so the material recorded was definitely pushing the bar of what the mainstream media often presents as modifications. The production might not count with a super high budget but they gained access to practices of all kinds and encountered unique people making it more special.",1404518400,,598,5.239583333333333
8198792,3,B000R3SFGQ,"I am a believer in freedom.  I do not advocate or condemn the activities or extent of activities presented here.  However, I am curious as to how these folks pay for their work and whether or not they are employable and able to create a decent standard of living for themselves via ongoing employment (or their own business).  Just curious.  The film itself actually is a good portrayal of this cross-section of humanity!  No disdain here, just trying to understand the economics of this movement.",1403913600,,497,4.8
8198793,3,B000R3SFGQ,"Modify allows a top layer look into the world of body modification. Sometimes enlightening and other times disturbing... the production value could be better at times, but overall an interesting viewing.",1399766400,,203,5.580645161290323
