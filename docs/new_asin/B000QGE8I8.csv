2838538,4,B000QGE8I8,"An interesting adventure and the finale of the classic series. Eschewing his former OTT mustache-twirling Master, Ainley is finally allowed to play the character as he wanted - a more forceful, determined and far more dangerous adversary. Ainley's final performance as the Master is also his most potent. A shame he wasn't allowed to portray the Master like this from his start. Loads of extras, especially on the end of the classic series, make this a winner.",1182211200,6,460,4.987012987012987

2838570,4,B000QGE8I8,"This episode marked the end of the classic series and the final appearance of Anthony Ainley (and his first since Season 23.)

There are things to rip the story about. The Cheetah People are problematic. The design has problems. The name shows a lack of imagination. The best Doctor Who stories give aliens that look like animals on Earth some other name. Here we just give up and go with Cheetah People. The finale of the story has some logic problems.

On the other hand, I have to admit that I like the opening of the story. It's got a very New Who style of it of setting our expectation for something scary and delivering it. I do like how the theme of ""Survival of the Fittest"" is interwoven into the story with little moments like the Doctor's search for Cat Food, which fits McCoy's comedic style.

This is one of Anthony Ainley's best performances as the Master. He doesn't go Over the Top (comparatively.) and it's an interesting position for the Master to be in.

Sophie Allred is good in this as she plays the material perfectly and gives it a lot of weight, and her interactions with Karra are actually interesting.

The closing monologue was obviously tacked off is lovely and let fans know the Doctor's adventures would continue. Overall, not a superb classic, but a good and enjoyable story, which pretty much sums up Season 26.",1434326400,,1343,4.602510460251046
2838571,3,B000QGE8I8,"This story is just plain weird.

It feels more like an Early McCoy then a late one. It sort of explores themes of survival of the fittest. And McCoy is more serious here then he is in his early stories. But The Master here is just...strange. That said you can see where the TV Movie started with for the Master here. I'd only recommend this character for fans for McCoy, people curious about the Master's evolution, or completiests that need to have the ending of Classic Who.

But if you're buying this just because it's the end of Classic Who. Don't. There's nothing in this story to really point that it's the last serial except for a small monologue at the end. Otherwise it's just a normal episode.",1433980800,,703,4.484375

2838577,5,B000QGE8I8,"Most reviews will give a plot synopsis and the special features on the DVD, so I'm just going to talk about why I personally love this story. 'Survival' is the final story of the final season of classic Doctor Who, season 26, and many people say that it isn't the ending they would want for the show. I, however, feel that 'Survival' is the perfect closing story. Not only does it feature the return of the Master, but the script is crackling with witty dialogue and great lines. Sylvester McCoy, Sophie Aldred, and Anthony Ainley all give their best performances from the show, and the supporting cast is also brilliant. Of course, the story isn't perfect. There are a few plot holes, and the final battle isn't particularly satisfying. But for every tiny flaw this story has, it makes up for it with an excellent script, terrific acting, and brilliant production values. I cannot recommend the story enough. 10/10",1398124800,,915,4.761006289308176

The story whilst not the strongest of them all was solid enough to provide a scape for the Doctor and Ainley's Master (his last TV performance in the role) to do battle, though the late 80's prevented the Cheetah people from seeming quite as menacing as they were intended, but they still worked. Sophie Aldred's Ace also was really coming into her own and the character was starting to mature into a person seeking something of a redemption and direction, great last performance from her.

The DVD is also a gem of extras, with features to showcase the last breath of Doctor Who in it's original form, well done BBC!",1390867200,,922,4.455621301775148

All in all I found the quality more clear -not superb, but better than the recorded VHS that I loaned from a friend. The features make me laugh and listening to the commentary is a whiff of fresh air.  The swan song for this era really hits home and makes you feel good and yet wary of all. I actually hid behind my couch at the confrontation scene on the motorcycles. The music quality is a bit to be desired though, but at that year, what can you do? A must for any Whovian.

The Doctor and Ace go back to visit Ace's teenaged neighborhood to find that there is a real problem going on. People keep vanishing to a parallel world where the Cheetah People hunt! The story itself is pretty entertaining, and the special effects are pretty decent for a classic episode, with a few exceptions. There is horseback and mototrcycle riding, and even explosions!  The usual quarry setting for the alien world is improved by very good CGI backgrounds, and lots of bones. The DVD extras on this one are excellent: lots of discussions of making of the episode, the cancellation of the classic series, and Andrew Cartmel discusses where the ""Cartmel Masterplan"" might have taken the series had it not been cancelled.

2838632,3,B000QGE8I8,"Survival is a typical McCoy season 25 and 26 story, interesting plot which keeps you engrossed in the story. However it loses points because it tries to serve a moral message. Firstly, the plot of the story is it's best aspect, with a race of Cheetah people able to teleport across the galaxy to claim their prey.  It's these superficial children's stories with deep hidden messages that plague the final two years of the series.

Now for the morality. The first is that competition is bad, and if one falls into the trap of ""capitalism"", it will inevitably consume that person. How you take this message ultimately depends on which side of the political scale you fall on.  Many people have done quite well with capitalism. Again, writer's prerogative.  The secong message of morality falls into the insane category. That is the ""agression vs pacifism"" arguement. Throughout the story we have the Doctor advising that if you ""do nothing and don't run"" the aggressors won't hurt you. Uh yeah...sure...nice fantasy. But try applying that in real life and you'll be killed or subjugated. Sorry, I don't buy that one. There are plenty of real life examples throughout the history of the world to back up the fact that this notion is quite insane.

Twenty-six years earlier, Doctor Who had the right message in a story called The Daleks. If you fail to fight for what you believe in, you will soon cease to exist. Survival unfortunately turns that message around. Doctor who may have grown up throughout the years, but it had regressed in maturity.",1304899200,3,1544,4.811320754716981

Of course we all know what happen nearly twenty years later in real life when the new series comes out. (of course for those of you out there I can't stand the made for tv movie of doctor who that fox did and I perosnally do not consider it part of the history) the dvd itself is full of great things to watch.

2838634,4,B000QGE8I8,"SURVIVAL is probably more notable for what came after it than it is for its own merits. Or perhaps I should say that it is notable for what didn't come after it, as this serial was the final episode of the original series of Doctor Who. I hadn't watched this in a number of years and the memory from my last viewing was that it was an ambitious but ultimately shaky production. Watching it again on DVD I was actually impressed by the story although I still felt that not everything about it completely works.

Anthony Ainley had been playing the Master for about eight years and for the first time is given a dignified costume. On a more serious point, I'll side with conventional Doctor Who fan wisdom and cite this as my favorite Ainley performance. Ainley's version of the Master had begun life being over the top and became less restrained as the years went by. However, to finally have the Master hitting a howl-at-the-moon moment of insanity and having to forcibly dial himself back is a welcome bit of fun and results in a great performance. From a character point of view the Ainley Master was always at his best and most interesting when attacking from a position of weakness rather than strength and his desperation in this story makes for great drama.

As I said, the story held up a lot better than I remembered. I think part of my problem was that most of my memory of the story came from the first of the serial's three episodes and that is by far the weakest and silliest of the episodes. The animatronic cat used by the production team is much maligned in the DVD extras and indeed looks nothing like a real cat. Too much of the story is taken up by cats feasting on milkmen and car washers.

On the other hand, the nature of the Cheetah People sort of works in a fantasy way, provided that you don't think about it too much.  The story's themes are at times incredibly unsubtle yet somehow the overall result does manage to hang together.

Of course, I must point out that almost twenty years later even with all the time I've had to reflect since then and also taking into consideration the discussions on the DVD extras, the Doctor/Midge motorcycle duel scene still doesn't make a lick of sense to me.  And can someone explain why cheetahs are seen howling like wolves?

The advantage of having this story on a restored DVD is that the sound quality is a massive improvement over what I was used to from the PBS movie-format version (I vaguely recall reading that the North American copy of the print had used an incorrect stereo sound mix).  It's also much easier to see that the album that Ace noticed in Midge's apartment is U2's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WAR/dp/B0013LPS8E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WAR</a>&nbsp;(although that does make her subsequent comment about U2's relevance a bit odd when you consider the album's release date).

The other great thing about this DVD is the plethora of extras, the most interesting to me being the documentaries about the production of this story and where the series would have continued if it had not been canceled by the BBC in 1989.  (Strangely, however, the CAT-FLAP documentary is presented as two parts despite being placed on a single DVD.)

I returned to SURVIVAL expecting nothing more than some Hale and Pace silliness and a good performance from Anthony Ainley.  Starting from that bar, the serial exceeded my expectations.  The plot makes more sense than I remembered, the incidental music is genuinely good and the directing is pretty impressive.  And for the first time I noticed that during Sylvester McCoy's final speech as the Doctor before he and Sophie Aldred ride off into hiatus, McCoy is gently rubbing the lapel of his coat jacket with his thumb... exactly the way that William Hartnell -- the first Doctor -- used to.  It's always fun to find something new in a classic.",1243641600,,3909,4.770370370370371
2838635,4,B000QGE8I8,"I've read other reviews that relegate Sylvester McCoy's Doctor to the bottom of the heap.  Based on this one story, I'd have to agree.  Which is a shame because Survival, in my opinion, is one of the best story lines in the entire Doctor Who franchise.  It's original and it anticipates a lot of the newer Doctor Who stories.  I realize time and space travel are the essence of all Doctor Who stories; but the particular way they're treated in Survival has a distinctly 21st century Doctor Who flair.  As to poor Sylvester McCoy's Doctor, I kept trying to recall who he reminded me of.  Then it dawned on me the next day (and I wish it hadn't): he reminds me of Rowan Atkinson's wretched Mr Bean character. But I definitely like McCoy's companion, Ace; I'd put her right up there with Rose or Martha Jones as best companion character.  I also didn't particularly like the musical arrangement of the Doctor Who theme; it was just too far out.  Finally, though I've only seen a handful of Doctor Who episodes so far, I can't tell you how tiresome the Master is getting.  Enough already with his way too predictable enmity with the Doctor.  He's almost like a cartoon character in that it looks like he finally gets it in the end, only to re-animate in the next episode.",1241049600,,1267,4.517543859649122
2838636,1,B000QGE8I8,"I never took a shine to McCoy as the Doctor.  Everything about his portrayal of the Doctor iiritated me, from his quirky mannerisms, to his bizzare innunciation of words.  He always seemed to be talking down to the viewer, and that just doesn't work in a series like Doctor Who, where the Doctor should always take the role seriously.  It just always seemed to me like he was dumbing the whole thing down.  It was like watching Mr Rogers as the Doctor.  I had high hopes for this one, as it featured the Master, a character that I loved(although Nathan Turner really overexposed him).  Still, Ainley was completely wasted in this horrid episode, which turned out to be the series' last episode.  It was very sad to see the show go out with a whimper like this, and thankfully it has been resurrected, but other than the historical significance of this episode, I'd say take a pass.  McCoy's ""if we live like animals we die like animals"" speech comes across as laughable.  I'm a Who LOVER, but even I have my limits, and this episode tested my loyalty to the show",1213833600,5,1062,4.518324607329843
2838657,4,B000QGE8I8,"In what served as the final episode of the ""classic"" Doctor Who series on BBC TV back in 1989, The Doctor takes Ace home to Perivale to catch up with old friends only to learn they are disappearing under very odd circumstances. But before the Doctor can get knee-deep in some old fashioned investigating,  Ace disappears and the Doctor finds himself once more at the mercy of the Master!!

But this is a different Master than we have seen in recent  stories. Here, the Master is desperate, more so than ever, and guest star Anthony Ainley is finally  allowed to play the part as he always wanted. The Master is behind the kidnappings, but he has new powerful allies, the Cheetah People. They may look harmless compared to new series standards but watch out!

If the Doctor cannot find the way for everyone to escape and return to earth chances are you WILL be a Cheetah Person before too long!!!

Ace is once again given a lion's share of the story, but the two feuding Time Lords must meet again for a final (?) battle. This time, The Doctor and his personal nemesis must endure a knock out drag out fight where anything goes, and all attempts at civility between them are ripped away as they both begin to succumb to the curse of the Cheetah!

But the Doctor is not certain of the final fate of the Master, who seems to escape death yet again but at what cost?
Perhaps he simply chooses to believe he is dead at last...and maybe he is..for now....",1208044800,,1449,4.445283018867925
2838658,4,B000QGE8I8,"This was the last story of the original ""Doctor Who"", which ran on the BBC from 1963 - 1989. Think about that for a moment. Six US presidents were in office during that time (more or less... JFK was killed the day the show started to air). When the program started we hadn't been to Moon. By the time it ended, we'd lost interest in going back there. If you added up the runs of the original ""Star Trek"" series, ""The Next Generation"", ""Deep Space Nine"" and ""Voyager"" you end up with twenty-four seasons of television. ""Doctor Who"" wound up with twenty-six. Of course, you can add ""Enterprise"" into there to boost the numbers and make it twenty-eight, but now with three seasons of the new ""Doctor Who"" on the air, and a fourth coming, ""Star Trek"" still loses.

There were a lot of problems with ""Doctor Who"" throughout those years. This is somewhat to be expected with a show that runs that long, after all. The SFX were usually laughable, even by the standards of the time. The monsters were frequently silly and the less said about some of the costumes and sets the better. But there was always a great enthusiasm on the part of the show. The people involved took it seriously. Most of the stories were original and interesting and the actors were, in general, top-notch, especially the ones who played the Doctor.

Sylvester McCoy was the first Doctor I paid attention to, really. My local PBS station started airing his shows right about the time that I was begining to get into ""Doctor Who"". The first episode I ever remember seeing was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Remembrance-of-the-Daleks/dp/B00005Y6XI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - Remembrance of the Daleks</a>. Though now I've gone back to see all the other Doctors, plus watched the TV movie and the new series, and though I like all the Doctors, the 7th one still holds a special place in my heart.

Which is why it's too bad McCoy was the one duty when the show finally folded. His Doctor was intelligent, funny and charming, but had a great ruthlessness about him when it was called for. Part of his charm was the various elements of the so-called ""Cartmel Master Plan"". Even as a wee shaver I took notice in ""Rememberance of the Daleks"" when the Doctor makes a verbal slip that implies he worked on the original time travel technology with Rassilon and Omega.

""Survival"" is the 7th Doctor's swan song, even though he returned for the TV movie. It's the last time we really see him on screen running the show, and it showcases great deal of what made him so cool. You see the humor, the kindness, the charm and the ruthlessness. You also see the evolving relationship with Ace, always a favorite companion, and of course Anthony Ainley's last ""real"" performance as the Master, finally allowed to be something other than a two-dimensional Evil Overlord (tm).

There's a lot that works in this story. Even the make up on the Cheetah People is rather decent. The story is tightly plotted and intesting, and reveals quite a lot about Ace and her life before she met up with the Doctor. In fact the only real complaints I have is that the story is rather short at only three parts, certain character's deaths were very, very telegraphed and the puppet cat looked just dreadful.

Despite those complaints, this was well worth seeing, and it's therefore somewhat surprising that despite the fact that I've been a fan of the show for about twenty years, I'd not seen this episode until a few days ago. But I'm happy to have seen it now.

The DVD is crammed with the usual extras the BBC throws onto these, including commentaries and behind-the-scenes stuff. Very illuminating is a documentry on the end of the original series, where you also get to hear some vague ideas on what might have been had they been on the air longer.

All in all, while this is not the best ""Doctor Who"" episode, it is very good, and a reasonably decent farewell for the show. It wasn't the send off the deserved, but it was better than what, say, ""Enterprise"" got, where their last episode was a decent ""Next Generation"" episode.

2838662,4,B000QGE8I8,"""Survival""--possibly one of the most unintentionally ironic titles in world television history, for it's with this storyline that ""Doctor Who"", TV's longest-running science fiction program, beloved by generation after generation across the English-speaking world, died. Not a spectacular death, either, but shot like a dog and left to expire like something the cat dragged in, a random casualty of beastly BBC infighting and survival-of-the-fittest competition with other programs. Of course, in those last months of 1989 when ""Survival"" originally aired, the viewing public couldn't know that this was to be the show's final breath or, as it turns out now, the beginning of its sixteen-year hibernation. Indeed, the storyline was not intended as such, and it strains unfairly under such a heavy retrospective burden. And yet as a fan I found it pretty much impossible to blinker my hindsight and just watch the story on its own terms.

I'll try to do so now, though. In and of itself ""Survival"" is a pretty standard example of ""Doctor Who"" at the time, neither a classic nor a clunker. More coherently plotted than ""Ghost Light"" but not as consistently interesting as ""Remembrance of the Daleks"", it still entertains as a reasonably sophisticated sci-fi adventure. In context, this story does fit right in with the two storylines preceding it (""Ghost Light"" and ""The Curse of Fenric"") by focusing more on the character of the Doctor's human traveling companion Ace than on the kindly renegade Time Lord himself, here especially as this tale begins with their visit to her old home neighborhood in the run-down suburbs of London and follows her missing friends to the bizarre planet of the Cheetah People. The Doctor's almost just along for the ride here, a real role-reversal indeed. Also linking these last three stories of season 26 is the common theme of evolution, or Darwinism to be more exact--a complex link in which the ever-dynamic ever-changing burgeoning profusion of lifeforms postulated by that theory is celebrated in ""Ghost Light"" whereas here the moral consequences and ethical repercussions of the theory (the cold, hard law of the jungle) are roundly criticized and vilified implicitly and explicitly. Along with this there also continues a politically leftist emphasis in the show, for the writer clearly categorizes basic competitive capitalism and violence in self-defense as Darwinist negatives. Writer's prerogative, certainly, but traditionally ""Doctor Who"" had been so crafted as to appeal commonly to folks of various political orientations, which somehow seems a fairer and wiser policy in light of its wide viewing audience.

And the whole non-violence bit gets the writer in a double-bind at the story's climax, and in what constitutes the story's main flaw the writer can only extricate herself from this by cheating: the Doctor and the Master, both of them gradually devolving into more primitive forms, are locked in mortal combat hand to hand and tooth to claw when the Doctor finally takes the moral high ground and refuses to fight, teleporting away instead. Yeah right. This avoids both the option unpalatable to the writer of having the Doctor kill the Master in self-defense and the logical upshot of the writer's stance (unpalatable to us) in which the Doctor would passively allow the Master to kill him instead, but all at the cost of dealing the story itself a nasty wound indeed. For that matter, the ethics of leaving a guy behind and stranding him on a world that's about to explode and disintegrate seem just as questionable if not more so than a good man-to-man round of fisticuffs.

That aside, the story has a lot going for it all the same. The script is extremely well-written and some of the dialogue is positively inspired. The realistically contemporary setting adds grit and tension to the adventure and is a good contrast to the oddly surreal landscapes of the Cheetah Planet. The Cheetah People are interesting aliens though very imperfectly realized make-up-wise; something less ambitious may have been called for, since the transitional phase with the funny eyes, fangs, and claws works pretty well. But still, an unusual concept, and in ""Doctor Who"" it's the concepts rather than the effects that count in the final analysis. Furthermore, however one feels of Anthony Ainley's take on the Master (I'm not usually too keen myself) he gave the role his all for the better part of a decade and here managed one of his more subdued and convincing performances. And Sylvester McCoy is as dependable as ever as the Doctor.  So ""Survival"" may not be a fitting end to the show or at least to the classic run of the show anyway, but it does afford a good few hours of speculative science fiction enjoyment and survives on that strength.",1190592000,18,4787,5.063371356147021
2838663,4,B000QGE8I8,"This was the last episode of the 'classic' episodes as the BBC calls it (1963 through 1989). It hints to things to come from the new series such as the Cat people as seen in a few of episodes of the new Doctor Who series ('New Earth' and end of 'Grid lock' among others) which came out in 2005 with Christopher Eccleston.
While the special effects might be dated compared to todays series is was not bad for its time either.
This is the last time you see the 'Master' until the new series as well.
While a did not like Anthony Ainley when I first saw the series in the late eighties I have to admit I prefer Anthony over the new ""master' of the new series.",1190073600,,656,4.1328125
2838664,5,B000QGE8I8,"As is well known, this was the last story from the classic series.  Let's face it, it is not one the better stories from the classic series' 26-year run but it definitely dropped hints that the show was heading toward a more darker, mysterious direction.  Some of that darker mystery is evident in the 21st Century series revival.

What I really liked about this 2-DVD set were the extras.  Sure, deleted and extended scenes are fun but usually the story still holds up without those scenes.  What I liked about those extras were the captions which described how the scene might have been used and how it was edited.  Normally they just show the deleted or extended scenes and leave it at that.

There was a two-part ""Making of..."" documentary which I found to be quite fascinating.  I truly enjoyed the documentary about the circumstances building up to the show's cancellation and the discussion about the proposed 27th season that never aired. The writers discussed their script ideas using illustrations depicting what might have been.

And although it was a bit odd seeing it in this fashion, it was a treat to see the late Anthony Ainley in his full Master regalia in the 1997 Terrance Dicks scripted continuity scenes from a video game.  It probably would have made more sense if you were playing the game.  Still it shows Anthony Ainley never lost his touch.",1187913600,2,1366,4.745762711864407
2838665,4,B000QGE8I8,"Released in August 2007, BBC DVD offers a pair of stories from the classic Doctor Who archives that represent both a new dawn and the final end for the original show, which ran from November 1963 to December 1989. Robot was broadcast just days before the start of 1974, heralding the arrival of Tom Baker in the role of the intrepid Time Lord, launching what would come to be seen as the golden age of the iconic series, whereas Survival, from December 1989, represents the final end to the show and a 16 year hiatus for the Gallifreyan's TV adventures.

It was more than just the arrival of Tom Baker as the 4th Doctor that represented the new beginning at the start of season 12. Behind the scenes, Producer Barry Letts and Script Editor Terrance Dicks were both handing over the reigns of the show they'd overseen since 1969. Dicks had already passed on the editorship to Robert Holmes, but penned Robot at his own insistence, marking it the first ever solo script he'd contributed to show he'd been involved with since 1968. Letts was in the producer's chair for the final time, being closely shadowed by his successor, Philip Hinchcliffe. Also fading out were the Earth bound stories featuring the UNIT team, with this being the penultimate adventure for the Brigadier, the long suffering foil to both the Troughton and Pertwee Doctors. His sidekick Benton would also be making only rare appearances in the future, although this story did introduce a new UNIT character, Harry Sullivan, played so brilliantly by Ian Marter, who would join Elisabeth Sladen's Sarah-Jane Smith as the Doctor's traveling companion for the entire season. So many changes and yet this story is still so familiar with the ground that had been set for Earth bound stories for the past five or six years. Indeed, it's very much part of the Pertwee era of story telling and very unlike most of what came after it. It's a simple story, but it works well and certainly leaves the viewers intrigued as to who the new Doctor might be.

By the time Survival hit the screens 15 years later; most viewers were simply intrigued as to how the show continued to survive at all. It had been slowly dying for quite some time and although it had survived one cancellation in 1985, its expiration was never really far away. Ghost Light was in fact the last story recorded, but Survival became the last transmitted. Not that many were aware of that at the time and it was only much later that it became clear the programme was not coming back.

Part of the reason for its demise is clearly seen in this story itself, a 3 part adventure written by TV newcomer Rona Munro. Munro went on to became a much acclaimed script writer, but within the ""grand master plan"" of script editor Andrew Cartmell's vision for the show, the scripts being produced were far to confusing and impossible for viewers to follow. Plus, Sylvester McCoy was proving to be a remarkably unpopular 7th Doctor, with ratings plummeting. McCoy does indeed seem way out of his depth and his almost unintelligible dialogue and extremely strange annunciation was as confusing to the viewers as the storylines themselves. What exactly is going on in Survival is anyone's guess!

Regardless of the story quality, which is largely subjective, what usually makes the Doctor Who DVDs so worth the money are the extras that the restoration team pulls together for each release. However, not for the first time, they've really over-egged the pudding on the Survival issue and stretched some very thin ideas to two discs and a much higher retail price. For such a short story, this seems particularly unfair on the fans willing to make the purchase. There are two fairly lengthy documentaries about the making of this short story and another looking at what ""might have been"" had there been another year of the show. Sylvester, together with his companion Ace, Sophie Aldred, and Cartmell figure prominently in all the documentaries, so their commentary for the episodes themselves becomes completely redundant as it's all said elsewhere. One neat idea is that episode 3 also carries an alternative commentary from some competition winning fans. There's also some frankly weird programming for children and a video piece featuring Anthony Ainley as The Master included, both of which are just plain annoying and seem to be there to pad the discs rather than to entertain.

The Robot extras are much more interesting, but again disappointing. So much of what Tom Baker, Barry Letts, Terrance Dicks and Elisabeth Sladen say in the commentary is again repeated elsewhere on the disc and indeed they've said it all before on many other DVD releases. There's a repeat inclusion of an excerpt from Blue Peter too. At the time the show was being made, a documentary crew were following the team, but only some limited, silent excerpts from that are used here, most of which, again, have been used on earlier DVD releases. It's entertaining what's here; it's just getting a bit tired and repetitive. Hopefully this is just a blip and future DVD's featuring the good Doctor will restore the normally very high standards and the repetition can be avoided, especially since it's repetitive in the case of Survival only to fill the space and justify cost.

Any fan will want to have these discs without question, even it it's just to have the immaculately restored picture and sound of the original stories. Casual viewers may perhaps want to save their pennies.",1187481600,8,5470,4.832443970117396
2838666,5,B000QGE8I8,"The last of the original series! Even though the makers were already in production when learning the show was to be the last. Thankfully Master meets the 7th Doctor played again by the late-great Anthony Ainley. ""Survival"" boasts a darker Doctor, facing a darker Master in the final battle with his evil Timelord nemisis (aleast until the Movie and ofcourse SEASON THREE of the new show!

The Doctor takes ACE home to the old neighborhood and many of her friends have gone missing. The two investigate, ultimately endding up on an alien world fighting for their lives and slowly becoming like the savage Cat-people who hunt there and on Earth.

A great show with some cool concepts and some funny animatronic moments. There is some great dialogue also, like the Doctor finishing the shopkeepers joke as a segue to the theme of survival of the fittest.
As is the words between the Timelords as they nearly destroy one another.

Drinking games for Survival. Drink whenever:

 1.) someone shifts worlds

 2.) a disturbingly fake cat hisses

 3.) a real cat appears

 4.) the man-cats break-into song

 5.) the Doctor says...""if we fight like animals we die like animals""

8196276,3,B000QGE8I8,"I am a lifelong Doctor Who fan who has enjoyed the series and its related media for a few decades. I have never cared for the Seventh Doctor (or the First and Second), but this serial is essential, because it is the last official serial, before the 2005 return. Yes, the Doctor Who Movie, which introduced the Eight Doctor, happened, and its ok, and considered canon, but Survival is the last official serial. I wanted it for that reason, alone. The plot has merit, but the special effects are...well, not so good, but that is to be expected. If you are going to view the classic Doctor Who episodes, then you just need to accept the special effects for what they are and focus on the narrative. The acting is good, throughout, and the ideas it plays with are interesting.

If you are a hardcore Who fan, then you should get this. If you only started being a fan as of the 2005 return, then you might want to pass this and other classic Who serials by.",1496793600,,952,4.378531073446328
