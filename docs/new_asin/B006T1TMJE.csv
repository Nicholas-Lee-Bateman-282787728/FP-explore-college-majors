5015493,5,B006T1TMJE,"Would like this series on American Television. These characters,even though solving crimes, are human,with the usual  foibles and human problems",1355529600,,144,6.2
5015494,5,B006T1TMJE,"Oh, I do enjoy this series!!  I was smitten with the first three episodes but the next installments are, in my opinion, even better.  We've now gotten past the introductory part of the story and are fully engaged with the characters (thanks to some fine acting and screen writing).  Though the mysteries are all different, revolving around the cases the Gotland police are investigating, each episode builds on the character development of the previous one. (It is a pet peeve of mine when series make each episode so self-contained that previously important characters suddenly disappear with no reference or explanation, or where important events in the characters' histories are not mentioned in subsequent episodes, etc.) Real life isn't so well-encapsulated and neither is this series.  Life's various parts and participants bump into and spill over each other.  And so do the characters and story lines of Maria Wern. Of course, it's a continuation of the story of Maria, a senior police detective in Gotland, Sweden. She's a recent widow, a doting mother, a good friend, and an excellent cop.  Eva Rose, who plays Maria, does a fine job creating a realistic portrayal of a woman doing her best, -- not always perfectly -- but she is always trying.  The second set of episodes takes the focus away just a bit from Maria and expands it to include more of her colleagues, who are an interesting and likable group of individuals.  Maria's best friend, Erica, (also the department's medical examiner), features more prominently in these later episodes, as does Maria's colleague, Ardvisson. He is the youngest cop on the team and upon his father's death discovers he was adopted. Thus, he enters upon an emotionally-fraught quest to contact his long-lost sister. Very specific mysteries wrap around Erica and Ardvisson as they provide a human backdrop for the cases the team is investigating.  I continue to appreciate the way the detectives are portrayed as a team of professionals. They are ordinary people, doing their best, and doing it with respect for the victims of the crimes as well as with support for each other.  It's a refreshing change of pace from the usual collection of dysfunctional adults that many series feature, ostensibly to create quirky characters ""of interest.""  Another bonus of the episodes is the cinematography -- there are some gorgeous vistas portrayed of Gotland, and they are woven into the dramas in such a way that the landscape seems a vital part of the overall production, truly influencing the mood.  I also love the theme music, which is so well attuned to the series. It's lovely, moody, and evocative -- a perfect choice. So, yes, all in all, this series is a winner.",1348012800,5,2711,4.9734513274336285
5015495,5,B006T1TMJE,These movies are outstanding...wish there were more than six!  The subtitles are easy to read and they occasionally sprak eenglish.,1341014400,,131,5.55
5015496,5,B006T1TMJE,"The locale where these four (4) hour and one-half intense police murder/mysteries are filmed would certainly make Series two (2) of this Swedish Series (with subtitles) most entertaining.  Filmed on a beautiful island (with all of the seasons being shown in different episodes--some especially beautiful winter scenes) in Sweden, the local is gorgeous.  However Season two (2) of ""Maria Wern"",in addition,  contains superbly written, directed and acted police dramas with episodes that contain very  high drama mysteries and great detective work done in a very understated (no screaming) manner by Maria Wern played superbly by Eva Rose who balances being a single-mom with being a great police woman. In fact, all of the Swedish actors (most unknown to me) are superb in season two (2) of ""Maria Wern"".  I certainly intend to purchase season three (3) of this series because this series is wonderful.",1338940800,6,901,5.229166666666667
5015497,5,B006T1TMJE,"This Swedish production is an excellent series, thanks to Eva Rose and a strong supporting cast. Rose plays homicide detective, Maria Wern. I found her character different from many women detectives, in that she is portrayed as being both competent and in charge, without ever becoming strident. As attractive as she is caring, in respect to her two fatherless children, Maria is also entirely compatible with her colleagues and her chief (unusual in many current international thrillers).

As detective stories go, ""Maria Wern"" is lifted above the average by its outstanding cast and its magnificent settings, which make the series a pleasure to watch (The story is set on the large Baltic Island of Gotland--East of Denmark and West of Estonia and Latvia). The principal actors are so engaging and convincing in their characterisations that they captured my attention throughout each episode (It is, perhaps, a good idea to take the stories at face value; as enjoyable as I found the last episode, which constituted a scenario that might be called 'Agatha Christie meets Nancy Drew' [Maria and her old school chums are marooned on a storm-swept island.], I decided that it was best to overlook some small holes in the narrative that I detected on second viewing. The setting, on the cliff-island of Stora Karls, is so spectacular, and the adventure so exciting that I simply wanted more of it!

The subtitles are presented clearly and in idiomatic English. I hope that this compelling and idiosyncratic series continues.

The viewer, however, might want to wait for the price to drop before purchasing.",1327449600,21,1604,5.091254752851711
5015498,4,B006T1TMJE,"Maria Wern, a Swedish Police Inspector who lives on Gotland Island is a police mystery/procedural that is so well done it draws you in. I enjoyed the last four episodes of Series One much more than the first Four.

It could be that I have fallen under the spell of Maria Wern played by Eva Rose. Certainly she is an excellent actress, and is showing her true feelings when the murder and mayhem that follow her daily enters her family realm. I was particularly taken by the third episode where a boy, and then another goes missing. Maria sees her children in their place and takes the motherly instincts and roles as hers. In the final episode she and friends are followed by someone stalking her, and even though some of this episode seemed childish to me, it was also very realistic. The writing and directing are excellent and bring the books from which this series was taken to life. The other actors in this series become familiar like old acquaintances. I identify the characters from the book, and they too become true life characters.  I do look forward to the next series.

Recommended. prisrob 07-03-14",1404345600,,1112,4.663265306122449

5015500,5,B006T1TMJE,"Can't get enough of Scandinavian crime? Actor Eva Rose's Maria Wern is a police inspector & mother of two young children. Based on Anna Jansson's crime novels, the series began in 2008 and hopefully will continue. Episode 4: MAY DEATH SLEEP (based on the 2002 novel ""M dden sova"") Episode 5: BLACK BUTTERFLY (based on the 2005 novel ""Svart fjril"") Episode 6: BOY MISSING (based on the 2007 novel ""ojke frsvPunnen"") Episode 7: NOT EVEN THE PAST (based on the 2008 novel ""Inte ens det frflutna"").  Only two of the novels appear to have been translated into English, but the more I watch Swedish television, the more obvious the similarities between the two languages. Researching for this review I learned (from Wikipedia) that Jannsson is a nurse & the stories are based on tales told by patients. There's that thing between cops & nurses again....but I digress.",1388620800,,861,4.857142857142857

5015506,5,B006T1TMJE,"I hadn't heard of Maria Wern but thoroughly enjoyed this series. I hope more are coming out. For some reason, Swedish detective series are extremely interesting, partly due to the extraordinary, though stark, scenery, and partly due to the great faces, fabulous performances, and stories unlike the majority of detective stories I've seen on TV.",1358899200,,345,5.290909090909091

8503876,5,B006T1TMJE,"Love this Swedish TV show (which is run in movie-length episodes).  Set on Gotland, an island off of Sweden's east coast, the scenery is beautiful.  Stories are quite good, and it's nice to see a woman detective who doesn't always manage to kick butt - realistic - she relies on her smarts.  Quality of filming varies based on director of the episode (not always the same director).  In reality, I don't think there are enough murders on the island of Gotland to support a whole team of detectives or plot lines for a series of movies (hahaha!  It's a very nice, peaceful island).  But fun anyhow.",1437436800,,597,4.584905660377358

8503879,4,B006T1TMJE,"These shows are very enjoyable---beautifully filmed, fairly believable police procedural and mysteries that have appealing characters, exciting although often convoluted plots and the benefit of the escapist charm of a foreign land. And, strangely, amazing sound engineering---the foley artist deserves an award!

Maria Wern is a tender, devoted mother, a dedicated police officer, and a bit of a control freak, which makes her an excellent detective. With just a hint of that Wallander style Swedish  ineptitude, that can be a little frustrating at times, but adds realism, these shows are sure to please anyone who is a fan of Varg Veum, Irene Huss or Kurt Wallander.

A warning, however, must be given about the last episode, entitled ""Not Even the Past"". This episode is neither believable, charming, nor a police procedural. The best way to describe it is a Halloween horror movie set on a deserted Swedish island.  This episode is not in keeping with the rest of the series, and I was disappointed. The preceding three episodes, however, were very satisfying.",1409184000,,1065,5.174418604651163
