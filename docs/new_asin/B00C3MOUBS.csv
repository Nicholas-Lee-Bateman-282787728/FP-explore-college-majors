5690328,4,B00C3MOUBS,"I'm happy that this DVD collection is finally listed on Amazon.  Surely that means it'll eventually be available, although no date is currently listed.  It's a shame this show wasn't given a fair chance on USA.  I saw lots of ads for it before it aired.  Once the first episode hit the air, I never saw another commercial for this show ever again.  I don't understand why.  It had great chemistry between the two leads and they were playing fascinating characters - which was the best part about the show.  These two characters were complex and messed up and so interesting to watch.  Had the show aired another season, I was looking forward to learning more about both of them, Wes in particular, and what exactly had happened to him to cause such a major breakdown.  Too many shows nowadays only gloss over the surface giving us either characters that are quirky just for the sake of being quirky or give us complex characters that are so dark and unlikable that I really don't care what happens to them.
Travis and Wes were different.  They'd had horrible things happen to them in the past, which left them emotionally scarred in the present causing these quirks we saw on screen and yet, they weren't total jerks.  I cared about them and wanted to get to know them better.
Maybe if USA had marketed this show more in that vein instead of making it look like an Odd Couple Cop Show with an emphasis on the laughs, a totally different audience would have tuned in and it would've done better in the ratings. Or, if USA had given the show a second season, maybe more people would have discovered it and enjoyed it.
Perhaps with these DVDs coming out some new people will find it and learn what a good show it was.  Although, it makes me a little worried that the DVD collection is listed as being on DVD-R and only printed on an as needed basis.  That certainly doesn't sound like a mass market release. Even the terrible ""Fairly Legal"" got a widespread DVD release AND a second season despite bad ratings, and it was a terrible, shallow, hot mess of a show (despite starring the likable Sarah Shahi).  Why some shows get the full release and others get this ""as needed"" type of release is a mystery to me.  I just look forward to finally having a copy of ""Common Law"" to keep and rewatch occasionally and think about what could have been if USA had given it a decent chance.
I've gotten DVDs and CDs from Amazon before that are made as requested and the quality has been good so I'm sure the quality of this will be equal to those.  It just concerns me that the release will be so quiet no one will know it's available.  Shame.",1365292800,34,2629,4.4324324324324325
5690329,5,B00C3MOUBS,This show is hilarious I wish they came out with more seasons. A must have.,1424044800,,75,4.066666666666666
5690330,5,B00C3MOUBS,"Loved this show when it was on. So disappointed they cancelled it.  It was one of my daughter's favorites as well. When she mentioned it several times, I decided to get it for her for Christmas. So glad it was available.",1420761600,,220,4.365853658536586
5690331,5,B00C3MOUBS,This was a great show.  I have no idea why they cancelled it after one season.,1416787200,,78,3.875
5690332,5,B00C3MOUBS,This was a great show. I was so disappointed when this series did not get renewed. It was such good writing and such a great cast.,1415491200,,130,4.038461538461538
5690333,5,B00C3MOUBS,It was perfect its showed beautiful on my tv and my computer,1413158400,,60,4.083333333333333
5690334,5,B00C3MOUBS,"Absolutely LOVED this show. I loved the creative story line and two strong lead characters. I can't believe they keep dreaming up ""reality"" shows instead of leaving a great show like this on. I have been waiting for it to be available on Amazon. THANK YOU THANK YOU!",1403913600,,266,4.5625
5690335,4,B00C3MOUBS,The DVD case that arrived was broken and the first DVD was scratched and skips.  The others seem to be fine.,1402790400,,108,4.142857142857143
5690336,5,B00C3MOUBS,"Warren Kole is at his witty, handsome, and talented best in this comedy series about partner cops forced to go to couples counseling.",1402012800,,133,4.826086956521739
5690337,5,B00C3MOUBS,Got into the show 1 month or so ago and I love it! I loved Michael Ealy on Almost Human and he is equally as awesome in CL! Warren Kole is great too! I wish that the show was given a chance...it's funny and really teaches you about all different types of relationships! Awesome show! Upset that I got into it late but I'm glad that I did!,1401235200,,338,3.985294117647059
5690338,5,B00C3MOUBS,I missed it when it went off the air. Glad I was able to get it. Will be ordering more movies.,1397952000,,94,3.5238095238095237
5690339,5,B00C3MOUBS,"I wish USA had given it another season. The characters were just coming together and wham! over.  Oh well at least they released what was available, which is surprising.",1397606400,,169,4.827586206896552
5690340,5,B00C3MOUBS,"These guys were robbed!  On any network, they would have had a continuing series, maybe for years.  Dynamic and interesting characters brilliantly played, fun mixed with serious cases, humorous banter mixed with breath stopping realizations.  Michael Ealy and Warren  Kole did a great job embodying their characters.  Kudos to them and to the writers, who gave us a final ep we can live with, unlike so very many shows that get canceled and leave viewers with cliffhangers.  I could fondly hope that some wise exec would bring this show back, along with Leverage, another absolutely brilliant series ... but I'm also hoping Michael Ealy's new series, Almost Human, will be renewed as it's also excellent and has tremendous potential.  I'd recommend any of these shows to anyone who enjoys humor, adventure, partnerships, characters that develop and grow, good story telling and high production values.",1396396800,,901,5.215277777777778
5690341,5,B00C3MOUBS,My mother in law loves this show but isn't really shopping online at Amazon so she had asked me to do some checking for her and found it on Amazon cheaper than in stores so it was a no brainer.,1395446400,,193,3.85
5690342,5,B00C3MOUBS,Can't believe they cancelled the show so fast. It is a great concept and I really enjoyed it. I'm hoping that so other network will pick it up but I guess not. Glad to have the DVD-R anyway!,1394496000,,190,4.026315789473684
5690343,1,B00C3MOUBS,"One of the DVDs is faulty. Most of the show can be watched, except for about 5 minutes. It probably won't last long. A poor purchase and I'm not really in seeing how good the return process is, because I could easily end up with nothing.",1390521600,,237,4.173913043478261
5690344,5,B00C3MOUBS,I enjoyed all the episodes of this series and hated to see it end. They were well written and well acted.,1386892800,,105,4.0476190476190474
5690345,5,B00C3MOUBS,"I loved this series. Even though it ran for only one season it is one of my""go-to"" shows when there's little on TV that interests me. I loved the relationships in this show and the chemistry all the cast had with each other. I especially enjoyed watching the interaction between Warren Kole and Michael Ealy. Neither character is totally likeable, but you still cared about them. There was plenty of action balanced with poignant character moments and well-timed humor.",1386028800,,469,4.949367088607595
5690346,5,B00C3MOUBS,"This show is probably one of the greatest shows that has ever been on the USA network. Its a shame that they only had it air for a single season. The characters chemistry between these two actors is absolutely phenomenal and not to mention hilarious. I am going to miss this show, but for now its just and incomplete series, resting with my collection.

Great show to watch and Is highly recommended.",1382400000,,400,4.555555555555555
5690347,5,B00C3MOUBS,"Loved the show...had recorded them all on the cable box, but now I've got them FOREVER!  USA network exec's are FOOLS, this was an awesome show.",1377820800,,144,4.538461538461538
5690348,5,B00C3MOUBS,"It is a shame this tv  show was cancelled after only 12 episodes.  Maybe the premise did not lend itself to further episodes as it is 2 police partners undergoing couples' therapy and how the therapy impacts their assignments as well as  themselves.  The 2 main actors, not only act well, but have an on screen presence that enhances the programs.  The supporting actors, quirky characters themselves, provide as excellent foil for the various roles as do the 2 primary actors.  I find it a wonderful mood improver after  those bad days at work.",1377302400,,545,4.73404255319149
5690349,5,B00C3MOUBS,"This series is so good that I can't believe it was cancelled.  The actors are great; the writing is great; the chemistry among the actors is great; each episode is great.  Thank you, amazon, for carrying this DVD!
I can remember the disbelief I had at this show being cancelled for low ratings.  Obviously, there was something else going on at USA network and because this show is so, so good, I will never watch USA network again until this show is reinstated.",1376179200,5,461,4.530120481927711
5690350,5,B00C3MOUBS,"This show was excellent entertainment and a shame it last only 10 episodes. The interaction between the main characters was not unlike Murtaugh and Riggs in the ""Lethal Weapon"" movie series.

What impressed me was when I saw that manufacturing would be essentially ""on-demand"", as significant order backlog presented the opportunity. I hope this technique is extended to other series.",1375228800,,384,5.4
5690351,5,B00C3MOUBS,loved it.  love anything Michael Ealy is in as he is a strong and talented actor.  waiting for his next project,1374969600,2,111,4.238095238095238
5690352,4,B00C3MOUBS,"I love the show and the quality of the dvd is very good.  However, I wish there were more deleted scenes and gag reels",1374364800,,118,3.9166666666666665
5690353,5,B00C3MOUBS,"But, I guess this DVD collection makes up for it somewhat.  Deleted scenes, gag reel, and a short bit about creating the show are all included.

For those who haven't ever seen it, this is one of the funniest 'buddy cop' shows I've watched.  Great chemistry between the entire cast, lots of laughs and memorable lines.",1372377600,,318,4.642857142857143
5690354,5,B00C3MOUBS,I thought this was a very good and different series. you don't often think of police officers needing therapy. the fact that it was couples therapy made it very funny.,1370822400,,167,4.6
5690355,5,B00C3MOUBS,"One of the best shows on TV that, for reasons yet to be given by USA Network, died way before its time. The DVD set, though slow in coming, is surprisingly complete with deleted scenes, a ""making of,"" and gag reel. Will miss this show forever.",1370390400,9,243,4.304347826086956
5690356,5,B00C3MOUBS,I liked this show when it was on the air I managed to watch all the episodes of it while it was on the air.  It was an interesting concept that I'm sure would have gotten better with time but it was cut due to low ratings.  Over all the packaging for this was pretty good and the bonus features and artwork of the show isn't bad.  Also the episodes I have watched look better than when they did on USA.,1369958400,,402,3.9382716049382718
5690357,5,B00C3MOUBS,I was also disappointed to see the show cancelled. I think it could have been great. You laughed when needed and serious when called for. Shame on you USA for giving up. I wondered what would have happened if you would have given up on both NCIS shows.,1368748800,13,252,4.270833333333333
5690358,5,B00C3MOUBS,This was a very entertaining show.  The quirky personality differences between the two main charactors is what made the program interesting.  The group sessions is what allowed the viewers to get to better appreciate the amusing trials it took for the two of them to be able to work together as a team.  It was like a male version of Rizzoli & Isles.  Another cop program sure......but there was enough emphasis on their personalities rather than on the darker side of the crime itself to make it a joy to watch the program.  I was really disappointed when Common Law was dropped.  This was one program I looked forward to watching.,1368057600,9,632,4.648648648648648
8577158,5,B00C3MOUBS,liked it-wonderful taping,1530835200,,25,7.666666666666667
8577159,5,B00C3MOUBS,"Love this show! I didn't catch it 'live' while on the USA network, so I'm glad it's been offered on DVD. What starts out as 'fun copy show' turns dramatic on the last episode; such a disappointment USA cancelled it.",1501459200,,215,4.4
8577160,3,B00C3MOUBS,Ok,1476662400,,2,2.0
8577161,5,B00C3MOUBS,This two guys are a perfect combination together another network should have pick it up great great show,1470700800,,104,4.833333333333333
8577162,5,B00C3MOUBS,I love Common Law miss the tv series though wish it would come back,1456876800,,67,3.857142857142857
8577163,5,B00C3MOUBS,Very funny and touching at the same time. A great show that nobody watched apparently.,1454803200,,86,4.8
8577164,5,B00C3MOUBS,Thank you for your service.  Very enjoyable to watch.,1453248000,,53,4.888888888888889
8577165,4,B00C3MOUBS,"Buddy cops and even dysfunctional buddy cops are really nothing new when it comes to genres.  However, the USA Network took it to a new level with Common Law.  The resulting show was never a strong mystery show, but it was a fun comedy.

Travis (Michael Ealy) and Wes (Warren Kole) are as different as they can possibly be.  Wes is uptight, responsible, organized, a former lawyer, and still trying to get over his recent divorce.  Travis is erratic at best and, having dated every female he knows at least once, is on the prowl for his next conquest.

Their working relationship fell apart right before the series started when Wes pulled his gun on Travis.  As a result, their Captain, Mike Sutton (Jack McGee) sent them both to see his marriage counselor, Dr. Elise Ryan (Sonya Walger).  And thats how they find themselves in group therapy with married couples who have relationships just as bad as theirs.

And somehow, whatever issue they are working through in therapy manages to come up in their case.  Whether its trust or revealing secrets, it is either a clue to the case or completely helps them solve it.  The cases?  Theres the woman who fell from the balcony of the honeymoon suite.  They get placed on a special task force to stop a gang steeling high end cars.  And, while taking on each other's personalities, they must find out who strangled a woman.

Obviously, the show, set in LA, fit in with the USA Networks brand of comedic dramas.  Yes, there are the serious moments, but there are plenty of fun ones as well.  Ironically, these most often come in the therapy sessions, while the more serious moments come as the guys finally apply that to their lives while out in the field.

In the pilot, neither guy came across that great, but as things progressed and we got to know the characters better, I actually grew to like both of them.  The acting from all the characters was great, but Michael Ealy and Warren Kole really did stand out as they had the widest range to pull off every week, and they did it perfectly.

Unfortunately, the mysteries were rather weak.  Okay, they were very weak.  I usually had the big twist figured out by the half way point.  Even with all the mysteries I read and watch, they usually still trip me up.  However, the fun of this show was getting to the ending, so I didn't mind that much.

The bigger unfortunate thing is that the show never did spectacularly in the ratings, so it has been canceled.  As a result, these 12 episodes are all we will get.  However, they are well preserved in this set.  They are preserved in their native wide screen and full surround sound.  There are no extras, and, at least at the moment, it is only available as a Made On Demand release from Amazon.  But I think it is worth tracking down.

If you missed this show and are looking for something with a light touch, pick up the set.  Youll enjoy your walk on the light side of crime solving with the dysfunction duo of Common Law.",1431561600,,2968,4.489719626168224
8577166,5,B00C3MOUBS,I loved this show when it appeared on the USA network and would highly recommend it.  Terrific cast and has the perfect mix of drama and humor.  I am very happy to know it is now on DVD but I had hoped for a 2nd season.,1431129600,,219,3.739130434782609
8577167,4,B00C3MOUBS,"I thought the two actors were so great together. I thoroughly enjoyed the series when it was on, but nothing beats being able to go back and watch some parts over and over. Wished there were more seasons!",1424304000,,204,4.394736842105263
