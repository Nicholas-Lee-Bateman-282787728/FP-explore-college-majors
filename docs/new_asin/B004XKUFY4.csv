4496056,4,B004XKUFY4,"Brian and his ""roommate"" Dennis have endured years of southern Sunday dinners with Brian's widowed mother, Mae, and his Aunt Rose.  Both of the women are  equally clueless about the fact that they are a gay couple, and constantly invite along a single woman for Brian to meet.  When Dennis and Brian break up, Brian shows up for dinner alone, explaining his ""roommate"" found his own place, and is further upset when that evening's female guest figures him out in a matter of minutes. Mae and Rose overhear her remark that Brian is gay, and, after some soul searching, they decide to find a new boyfriend for him.  They go to a local gay bar, and talk a go-go boy into coming for Sunday dinner.  When Brian brings along a guest they were not expecting, luckily Mae and Rose have other guests who come to the rescue.

This is a madcap, over-the-top comedy, kind of in the same vein as ""Sordid Lives,"" complete with Southern accents that come and go. There are liberal doses of camp and stereotypes, drag queens, internet hook-up sites, ageist twinks, leather people, bible thumping, an ex-gay conversion center (complete with shock therapy), and an overall implausible premise that you want to believe anyway, because it is just so darned much fun.  Positive depictions of gay youth, and lessons to parents who don't accept their gay or lesbian children, are valuable parts of the story.  Written/directed and produced by Keith Hartman, best known for several (equally ""over-the-top"") gay novels, on a tiny budget that he put to excellent use (Many of the extras in the bar scene are actually crew members.)  Unrated, but would be PG for light sexual content. DVD extras listed include commentaries by Hartman (which doesn't work on my retail DVD) or by the actresses who played the two women, a go-go boy video, deleted scene, trailer and cast/crew profiles.  Won several gay film festival awards with its infectious positive humor.  I give it four stars out of five.",1308960000,5,1966,4.821428571428571
4496057,5,B004XKUFY4,"A very cute, over-the-top comedy with a subtle message of acceptance and unconditional love. You Should Meet My Son is a lighthearted movie, with a much deeper, underlying moral. I loved the shift in the mother's behavior from beginning to end. Watching her go from denial over her son's sexuality, to begrudging acceptance, and then finally fully embracing him as is was a beautiful thing. We should all be so lucky as to have a parent who can cast aside a lifetime's worth of ingrained beliefs and prejudices in order to encourage and support their child.",1308787200,5,557,4.8125
4496058,5,B004XKUFY4,"An understanding mom decides to fix her closeted son up with a hot guy to show her support for his life choices. While looking for the right man for her son she collects an eclectic group of friends Her son comes home with a woman and announces he's engaged. But Mom knows what's best for her boy and sabotages the engagement by introducing the future in-laws to her new friends.

Funny, poignant, entertaining and enlightening, 'You Should Meet My Son' is a small budget movie featuring big budget talent from an incredible cast and stupendous script to delightful direction.

Definitely a must see.",1308787200,5,600,4.815533980582524
4496059,5,B004XKUFY4,Just had a chance to watch this. This movie is so funny and sweet. It manages to weave several different threads together and keeps the pace up. This film will amuse you and touch you. It'll make you wish you knew these characters.,1308528000,3,231,4.395348837209302
4496060,5,B004XKUFY4,"Full of vibrant queer characters and a central story line of a mother coming to terms with her son's sexuality, ""You Should Meet My Son"" is outrageous and funny. The best thing about it? It's a film for the entire family.

The writer/director obviously treats the film with lots of thoughtfulness, love, and care. It shows.",1308441600,4,323,4.767857142857143
4496061,5,B004XKUFY4,"I saw the film at a festival screening.  The movie provides a delightfully humorous view on potentially socially unpleasant or awkward situations.  Sometimes you have to laugh at what life throws at you.  This film produced nearly non-stop belly laughs while still getting across an important point about families, coming out, and being true to yourself and your values.",1308268800,5,370,5.237288135593221
4496062,2,B004XKUFY4,"If non-stop, shrieking fake Southern accents, garish stereotypes, and humor as subtle as being hit in the head with a cast iron frying pan send you rolling in the aisles, then you will probably love this movie. I was raised in a subtler, less obnoxious South than the one celebrated here, and I am too happy being gay to relate to this hysteria, so I hated it.

But any gay movie that celebrates being gay deserves some support, so I gave it two stars just for having its heart in the right place. God bless it, its makers, and anybody who can enjoy it.",1308009600,10,553,4.3173076923076925
4496063,5,B004XKUFY4,SO delightful to watch a Southern Mom and her spinster sister do an attitude 180 when they find out their only son/nephew is gay.  First they deny and then they try...to get him a boyfriend..with all the mint julip Southern charm at their disposal.  And it works!,1307577600,55,263,4.574468085106383
4496064,5,B004XKUFY4,"I saw this film at a limited edition screening, and laughed non-stop through the whole thing. It is heartwarming and funny and is a must-see for everyone, as it addresses some of the touchy issues of homophobia, religious intolerance, and ex-gay ministries. You will want to watch it over and over again.",1307404800,49,304,4.865384615384615
4496065,5,B004XKUFY4,"I pre-ordered this directly from the Writer/Producer a while back, and received it about a month ago.  I've already watched it 4 times.  This is a really great movie; it's not only funny and a bit over the top, but also has an important message to present: Be who you are and love life.  ""Baby, I was born this way!""  Very Highly Recommended.",1307404800,65,342,4.380952380952381
4496067,5,B004XKUFY4,"This delightful, gay-themed, screwball comedy of errors makes a perfect gay date night movie.  Joanne McGee and Carol Goans as the stand-outs as the two sisters who conspire to get their gay son/nephew a date.  This could have been a one joke wonder but the plot manages to get more engaging right through the end of the third act.  You do have to overlook the production problems that come with a low budget indie, such as people speaking off mic or the character of the neighbor boy whose name we never hear until his second appearance.  Brian, the son/nephew who needs a date, happily doesn't get too much screen time, since  he's horribly miscast for the part and never earns much sympathy from the audience. The best scene is in Act 1 when mom tries to pair gay Brian up with a Suzanne, straight lawyer. Jaclyn Napier's energetic and polished performance gives a strong opening to movie. Too bad her character disappears after the first scene.  The movie does rely heavily on easy laughs from the usual gay and homophobic stereotypes but at least we're spared the gay tragedy storylines that only indie film critics seem to love: hate crime (Brokeback Mountain), terminal illness (Philadelphia, Jeffrey) and self-loathing (Boys in the Band).  Like the classic, screwball comedies from other eras, this is an old fashioned film with a contemporary theme that will keep you smiling for 90 minutes.",1505001600,,1400,4.857142857142857

Their idea to help the son is to find him a good boyfriend.  And all kinds of hijinks ensue as they try to find a boyfriend.  I absolutely love the message of the movie, the acceptance and love for the son, which pushed the two women to take their acceptance to complete meddling.  This movie is absolutely funny and full of wonderful people.  It is about acceptance, joy, and embracing who people are.  The end of the movie still makes me laugh out loud.",1458000000,3,584,4.254545454545455

4496127,3,B004XKUFY4,"I read the 1 and 2 star reviews about how this movie was low budget, without powerful acting, and that too much was unbelievable. What's unbelievable is the people who gave those reviews. How often do you see major studios spending major bucks and hiring major actors to do a movie covering a subject like this? Not very often at all. They're just now getting comfortable having it on TV. The reviewers mention ""To Wong Foo"" and ""Brokeback""; those movies are 10 years apart! You shouldn't have to wait that long to see a decent movie addressing a real life issue, because that's what it is, real life. So yes, this was low budget and filled with actors probably no one's seen or heard of, and no, there weren't any stellar, breakout performances. But I thought it was cute, it was sweet, and it had its funny moments. And it shows how a mother SHOULD act if and when her child comes out: with love and support. The best line in the movie was when she told her son that if the world wouldn't give him what he wanted, then she would change the whole world because she would never change him. (Yes, I almost cried.) It is pricey but I enjoyed it and don't regret watching it. The only thing I would've changed, I would have liked to see things working out between Brian & Chase, maybe a few months down the road. What can I say? I'm a sucker for epilogues and HEAs.",1454716800,10,1362,4.345098039215686

Be prepared, however, to overlook some of its obvious, almost cloying contrivances.",1395964800,,371,4.983870967741935

4496277,5,B004XKUFY4,This is a fun movie!  The production value is low - but it makes up for it with a great story and casting.  We watched this a year ago - and then watching it again recently.

So son figures he'll get married to a ""real girl"", and finds the daughter of a local Baptist minister.  Meanwhile, Mom and her Sister start the search for a partner for the son, and they discover the whole gay scene...including a likely candidate.  The fun really begins when they invite the entire gay entourage to dinner (son doesn't know this) and attempt to introduce their choice of a new partner.  Son brings his fianc, and that turns the entire dinner into a funny episode.  Mom redo crates the entire house, and hang a painting of a nude George W. Bush above the fireplace (no...really...I'm not kidding) (he was rather well endowed in the painting, but that's another topic for another time). The Baptists and the daughter show up, and the hilarity begins.  I won't tell you the ending...you need to see it for yourself.

Oddly enough, the one scene between the mother and her son where it became very serious was quite moving to me, enough that it got me a little teary-eyed.  They played the scene well, and then it was back to the fun.  I liked the movies so well that I bought it.

While staying out of the too-raunchy zone, something I thought was inevitable with its NR rating, it displays a sense of humor that anyone can appreciate. The lovable plot reveals the confusing and difficult life of a gay person, and helps reinforce it with its rural Alabama setting. The immediate acceptance and continuance of the lovable mother's interference in her sons life shows just how far family should go to ensure happiness, and is a good response to her son's sexuality. Finally, removing the stigma from homosexuality and humanizing some of the ""stand out gays"" in the film create pleasant and funny characters. I enjoyed this film thoroughly, and my only problem with it is that it wasn't long enough.",1372464000,,810,4.792857142857143

The ""ministry"" depicted in this film is nowhere close to ex-gay ministries I've encountered.

This movie's denouement is a wonderful reinterpretation that classic scene during which Mame Dennis fantastically derails the engagement of her beloved Patrick Dennis to the ghastly Gloria Upson.  Only in this film, the betrothal derailment is accomplished not with pickled rattlesnake and flaming cocktails, but with flaming drag glamazons and a nude portrait of George Herbert Walker Bush.  No. Joke.

While this film is set in Birmingham, AL, the actors' accents were inconsistent.  I know this fact because I grew up in Alabama.  The actors portraying the aunt and mother gave good approximations of the accents of educated, upper-middle-class, Alabama females of (about) age 60.  The son and the rest of the cast were less spot-on.

It's a comedy that pokes fun at stereotypes, so characters may be a little over-the-top or downright ridiculous at some points, but that's what adds to the appeal.

4496378,5,B004XKUFY4,"I can't say enough about this movie! It's about a Southern Mom who spends the beginning of the movie parading prospective wives for her single son. She then discovers he's gay. Her journey from that discovery to her acceptance is right on the mark. I should know since I am an only child in a Sicilian family. Unfortunately, my mother didn't have the tenacity to work through her discovery to acceptance (though she finally resigned herself to the fact). This movie showed how it could be, how it should be! Aside from all this, the movie is well-written and hilarious! Joanne McGee, the Mom, was perfect as she tried to adjust her life to this new world, and she was absolutely exhilarating and uproariously funny. However, Carol Goans, who plays Aunt Rose, simply stole the show! I won't say more, but whether this situation applies to your own life, and even if it doesn't, this is a movie well worth viewing!!

4496380,2,B004XKUFY4,"Don't believe the reviews here. The reviews have to be a scam to get you to watch because this movie is awful. Over-acted and over-wrought!  The movie's first half-hour showed promise but then the movie quickly fell apart once the mother and her sister visited a gay club.  The plot stalled and the story became predictable and dull. Once the sister gets made over in a bathroom by 2 drag queens, (while the mother inexplicably doesn't even seem fazed by her sister's prolonged absence in an unfamiliar place), I stopped watching. I have to comment on a glaring inconsistency.  In the beginning, there is a parade of different girls invited over to dinner, representing all the times that the mother and the aunt had tried in vain to do some match-making for the son (who was secretly gay). The clothing for the mother, aunt and the different girls always changes from one attempt to another. With each attempt, they show the son and his boyfriend seated at the table. However, in error, their clothing never changes. It should have. Speaking of changes, this film needed a much, much better production team!",1347667200,,1108,4.790575916230367
4496381,5,B004XKUFY4,this is a wonderful movie about a mother that loves her son more than cares about sticking to the rules. it's just wonderful how the movie plays out. the mother and aunt are fantastic. a must see!!!,1347148800,,198,4.378378378378378
4496382,4,B004XKUFY4,"This movie started out very slow - and with the odd stilted acting that you see on the stage, very theatrical, and in the specific style you might see at an off-Broadway show.  After getting over the over the top performances of the Southern mother and her sister, the sort-of unbelievable naivete that they exhibit going online to see what Manhunt is about and going to their town's gay bar, I started to actually like the movie.

It is most certainly NOT of the same standard as a movie like Trick, but it is good.  The parts that start to bring the drag queens and muscle-leather couple and the young 16 yr old gay neighbor kid together start to feel even more like Spanish Golden Age Theater or Oscar Wilde style of surprise-shock of unexpected conversations and interactions.

The end of the movie was tender, showing the total love and support the mother has always had, and the dreams she has for his happiness.  If you're expecting a high-gloss film with very high movie-type standards, this is not for you.  If you are more relaxed about those expectations, then you should enjoy the film as much as I ended up enjoying it.",1346976000,,1132,4.579207920792079

That being said, I don't really buy movies, let alone spend $20 on one! This on though, i'd spend that again because this is the best heartfelt movie i've seen in a long time. Its HILARIOUS and pretty much unrealistic how accepting the mom and aunt are but you don't really care. It makes me cry every time when the mom tells her son that she will change the world for him if they can't accept him the way he is and give him what he wants. A love like that is just amazing.

4496389,1,B004XKUFY4,"No matter what these 4 star reviews on Amazon say this film is very poorly made and seems like a high school play.  Harsh lighting, sound that that is not mixed necessitating adjusting the volume over and over. Strident delivery from the actresses playing the mother and aunt. A truly embarssing scene in a gay bar that is played against one wall as if there really was no set. And the ending sequence was just a confusing mish mash with everything shot from one angle in the livingroom like a tableau or stage play. In fact in the final moment between the mother and son she literally escorts him downstage closer to the camera to play their final moments. Very odd. In fact lots of scenes were played out with no coverage--just a single shot with two or three characters standing and reciting their lines.  I can only assume that friends of the director or the production are posting these extremely misleading complimentary reviews.  The director touts this as a ""micro-budget movie"".  Indeed it is.  A lamentable product of an unfortunate phase in indie films.",1342396800,3,1064,4.72972972972973
4496390,3,B004XKUFY4,"It's a sweet and entertaining idea for a movie in a weak production. The acting is ""community theater"" level and serviceable.
The point of view is flawed. We start with  the son's point of view, then a little late in we're switched to his mother and aunt's pov.  The actor playing the son is better than the rest so he steals the scenes he's in, perhaps that's the issue. The film gives us the adventures of the mom and her sister. Unbeknownst to son, they've learned he is gay. They quickly transition from firmly against to full acceptance then set off to find him a boyfriend to replace the one he's just lost. It all appears to happen in the span of a few days, which is unreasonable for the outcomes.
I thought the premise, many segments and a lot of the dialogue were entertaining, even touching. The moms zany character is infectious and the theme that over all she loves her son and wants to find him happiness is engaging. I'd actually love to see these characters and this plot, even some of the script after some skilled filmmaking.",1341360000,,1043,4.484210526315789

4496400,4,B004XKUFY4,"This is another gay comedy and the more the merrier I say. This is one with a twist though as the central characters are the mother and auntie of our central gay character. He is Brian (Stewart Carrico) and is the only son, of Mae (Joanne McGee). She is a Southern Belle type of mom that Tennessee Williams could have written odes about. She lives with her sister, Aunt Rose (Carol Goans).

Their raison d'tre of their entire existence is to get Brian married off to the sweetest little, southern gal and start popping out sweet, little, southern babies. This they do by inviting Brian to dinner and just happening to have also invited an eligible spinster from their wide coterie of friends. Brian always brings his `house mate' Dennis and despite the obvious chemistry between the two men, they just don't get it.

Well Dennis finally leaves Brian and discovers his Mr Right. Mother and Auntie then accidentally discover the awful truth that he is - `you know - one of them!' Well after they have gotten used to the idea they decide that they love him just the way he is and set about using their extensive dinner making skills and womanly charms to get him a gay man.

Their first port of call is the local gay bar and discorama, which is one of those clubs that has a bit of everything, go go dancer, leather fetish, twinks, drag queens etc. They seem to take to it like a pair of ducks to water and the fun begins.

This is a warm comedy and though gay themed there is nothing here that would offend anyone, some cross dressing and no man on man action, as the stars here are the mum and aunt and they really do steal the show especially Joanne McGee who is a tour de force of good intentions - road to hell type woman.

Keith Hartman wrote and directed this and it is a brilliant effort. He has managed to get great performances and a good quality production from what was obviously a limited budget as the sound is a bit ropey in places, but that is entirely forgivable. I laughed on a number of occasions and it left me wanting more. So I watched all the extras and there are three excellent short films from Mr Hartman and some `Gratuitous Go Go Boy Footage'. All in all an enjoyable light hearted comedy that deals with all the issues in a caring way but with enough challenges to stop it from getting too schmaltzy. Not the best film ever but I really enjoyed it and hope you will too.",1331078400,4,2396,4.36322869955157

4496402,5,B004XKUFY4,"You Should Meet My Son is a great movie.  Wonderful acting; the chemistry between the actors is a joy to watch.  Wonderful script.  Incredible production value for a low-budget indie film.  It is both funny and heartwarming, and manages to be just a touch over the top without ever feeling unreal. (It read so true that I found myself wanting to go to Alabama and meet all these wonderful people.)

It was a great pleasure, too, to see a film starring women who are middle-aged and (mostly) comfortable with it.

Although the central issue is Mae coping with discovering that her son is guy, and growing to accept this, then finding him a life partner, You Should Meet My Son is so much more than ""a gay movie"". It's about family (the one you came with and the one you build for yourself).  It's about caring for people as they are, and working to make the world better for everyone.  It's about seeing through your prejudices to the real people below and learning to live with difference (and one of the great things about the film is that it does this, presenting even the unsympathetic and prejudiced characters with understanding).  Also just a little bit about both accepting yourself and about letting your hair down and learning to enjoy life.",1330041600,,1250,4.6454545454545455

Mayhem ensues, culminating in a hysterical dinner party that is a copy of the one in Auntie Mame where Mame is sabotaging her nephew's relationship with his unsuitable girlfriend.  The ending is a little predictable, but the whole movie is so charming, with parts of it being laugh-out-loud funny, that you don't mind.  The characters are believable and engaging and immensely likeable, (well, except for the Bible-thumping bigots but they are hysterically funny.)  Drag queens, go-go boys, leathermen are all part of the delightful mix.  And unlike many of these independent gay comedies, the acting is quite good and reasonably convincing.

4496408,2,B004XKUFY4,"If you liked Torchsong Trilogy, To Wong Fu, Priscilla Queen of the Dessert or Broke Back Mountain, then you are in for a big disappointment with this film. To me, it was just moderately funny at best and has no real substance. I guess it's amusing that you could find two totally accepting women living in the Bible Belt, who are just thrilled that their son and nephew is gay, but other than that, it is just too unbelievable and doesn't make much sense.

The subject of the story, the young man in question is so lack luster and so far into the closet that he can't seem to find the doorknob, even though his mother and Aunt are doing all they can to help him. And I would think that any Mom and Aunt who have accepted their son and nephew's homosexuality and want to help him, would do a lot better to match him up with a regular guy than try to match him up with a room full of drague Queens and Leather S&M numbers.

The tour of the Gay Cure Clinic was funny, but again, a little over the top. Likewise the drague Queen hitting on the fundamentalist minister was amusing, but pretty unlikely. Unlike Torchsong, To Wong Fu and Priscilla, there is no clever or witty dialogue nor are there any great and memorable one-liners in this movie or any great and universal truths.

Over all, the entire movie, to me, is very amateurish and silly; it seems like something that might have been filmed in the 1970's. The mother and aunt seem to have much more fun hanging out with gay counter culture people than the son, who is so boring and uncomfortable with himself and anything gay, that he has already lost his first lover to another young man. It basically presents gay men as silly, vascillating individuals who spend their lives pretending to be women, pretending to be macho men and pretending to be happy. There are no middle of the road, well adjusted gay men in this movie; the kind that a mother or aunt would be happy to accept.",1329264000,7,1936,4.387186629526463

Now I've watched with and without the commentary 4 times since last evening and I have just ordered this film from Amazon.  It is truly an amazing little low budget film.

There is something so genuine about the story, the characters and the actors.  On top of that, the film is simply FUN. It is hard to imagine Mae and Rose aren't actually sisters.  Their on screen chemistry is amazing.

I actually know of similar ""fish out of water"" experiences that played out in a similar way simply because the people involved are honest and good natured people.  That's what this film is all about.  It is a film where acceptance goes both ways, which is nice for a change.

Overall, the story is cute and so much fun.  The acting is good to excellent.  It is so easy to get caught up in the story that any evidence of ""low budget"" simply isn't noticed.

I won't beat around the bush:  I loved ""You Should Meet My Son.""  It goes a long way towards making up for all the bad independent gay movies I've seen along the way.  It's a movie with a very big heart, and it's both funny and touching.  For whatever shortcomings there may be in the acting or script, they're largely irrelevant in the final analysis because the end result is so much greater than the sum of the parts.  It's not a perfect movie, but even still, it's extremely affirming, embracing, and rather touching.  I don't doubt this is a movie I will want to see again more than once in the future.  Congratulations to Keith Hartman (the writer/director) for a job well done.  Also, among the extras on the DVD are earlier short videos that Hartman made.  My favorite of the lot is ""The Defenders"" from 2009--it's fantastic and really funny, while also getting the point across rather potently.

Imagine Lucy and Ethel find out little Ricky is gay and they decide to get him a husband so he won't have to go through life alone and unhappy.  Wicked.",1320710400,8,455,4.357142857142857

It is very overdone, and the acting isn't topnotch, however the reason this movie had appeal for me, is because you really do start to look at most of the characters and say- I wouldn't mind having these people as friends..  The mother's support for her son is also non-typical, but it is also something more mothers could aspire to, especially with current problems facing their lgbt children.",1318723200,3,510,4.593406593406593
4496432,4,B004XKUFY4,"This movie is hysterically funny and yet touching as well.  An Alabama momma wants her son to be happy and, upon finding out he's gay when he breaks up with his boyfriend of five years, decides to help him find a mate.  First, she and her sister get a neighbor's teenage son to help them get on the Internet to look for men for the son (that scene was a real hoot).  Then, by going with her sister to a gay club, where the two old ladies met drag queens and leather boys, her neighbor's underage son again, a gorgeous stripper (who's an art student), and a host of other stereotypes from the bar.  So fish out of water, yet it works, kind of.  Then the son decides to marry the daughter of an anti-gay preacher and his wife and the story became a combination of ""La Cage Aux Folles"" and ""Auntie Mame,"" as Momma had to rescue her sweet boy from the sharks.

I actually laughed out loud more than once in this film.  Touching scene near end when Momma assures her son how much she loves him ""just like he is"" and wants him happy.  I was lucky to have a mother with that attitude, but I know too many others are not so lucky.  Not a deep movie, not deeply moving or worthy of major screen awards, but not at all badly done and quite amusing (if highly derivative), and some really good eye candy in the supporting characters.

It is fun, not very Hollywood movie, not very professional, but it is a great movie. It is very close to what is happening right now in many families not only in United States. It shows especially how some gay people do not go out because they do believe that the family will die after that.

As I watched it, the thought crossed my mind that some reviewers would call much of the movie stereotypical and cliched, but I didn't care!  So what?  The reason stereotypes and cliches exist is because they're true in life so while I'm not calling this movie ""real life,"" it certainly has enough humorous situations and non-offensive funny characters that it kept me laughing out loud practically throughout the film.  I was caught by surprise that the son/nephew had decided to marry a girl to 1) please his family, 2) have children, and 3) avoid being alone in life, but the script writers dealt with that whole plot twist in a remarkably pleasing way, in my opinion.  I was glad that the religious-right (actually wrong, of course) characters were not overly demonized.  They were certainly ""put in their place,"" but it wasn't really harsh and cruel like it could have been in a gay movie.  The movie was so bright, colorful, and filled with such extraordinary detail that I almost felt like I was watching a big budget or big studio film!

It is very well written with a great combination of simple humor and biting wit, while adding just enough camp to make it a blast!

4496446,4,B004XKUFY4,"True to the DVD cover art, ""You Should Meet My Son"" doesn't masquerade as being anything other than light and fun entertainment, but it is also honest and passionate. In brief, a young gay man has tried far too hard to keep his sexuality secret from his mother and aunt - to the point where his partner leaves for greener pastures. Brian's mother and her sister discover the big gay truth and quickly dispense with their culturally acquired bigotry. They then set out on a mission to find heartbroken Brian a suitable gay male partner - taking a crash course in gay community diversity and etiquette in the process. However, thankfully, things are not that simple (and only marginally overladen with stereotypes).

Keith Hartman does a wonderful job with the script - keeping things fresh, lively  and relevant. Hartman also ought to take a deep bow as director in his first feature film - and he happily gives  plenty of due credit to the talented crew he assembled to make this film look consistently beautiful and interesting, and to also sound wonderful (especially, as we learn from the commentary tracks, in quite challenging circumstances).

The editing is particularly praiseworthy - my award goes to Donna Matthewson. The slightly surreal colours remind me very much of the UK original 1999 Queer As Folk series (NB: the cinematrogaphic quality is much better in this film - no doubt due in part to the advancements in digital technology).

The DVD extras are valuable - including Keith's short films in opposition to Proposition 8 (which excluded same sex couples from legal marriage in California). The only (minor) trouble I had with the DVD was in getting the correct commentary track to play - on two different brand players I could only get the one with the actors to work from the ""extras"" menu (no matter what selection I made), but by using the ""audio"" select on the remote I could also choose to hear the commentary by the writer/director and editor.

I recommend that anyone who likes the film (surely that's anyone who sees it) should also take the time to watch the film with each of the two commentary tracks - and then watch the film again with the original soundtrack. Your appreciation is significantly amplified, making ""You Should Meet My Son"" a film which you're likely to recommend to all your family and friends, and to enjoy re-watching  with them any number of times. An excellent original music soundtrack adds further lustre.

The cast all do a fine job and they must be very proud of the final edit. It's no surprise that this has been an award winner at gay and lesbian film festivals.",1311897600,17,2622,4.772626931567329

Since you've probably already seen other comments / reviews outlining this story, let me only add that it is, basically, just the story of a Gay young man who's afraid to Come Out to the family.

Oh, and are there ANY bases not covered by first-time, feature length Director, Keith Hartman?  (If I miss any of the important themes he provides, please just add them in a ""Comment"" following this review).  Hmm...let's see now.....I recall that they include:

1 - Loss of the long-time boyfriend (don't worry...he doesn't die).

2 - Discovery by family of someone's ""abnormal"" sexual orientation (a Big 6 on the Kinsey Scale).

3 - Struggle over Acceptance.

4 - Search for a suitable replacement, needed due to Item 1, above.  (Doesn't hurt he's a gorgeously hunky go-go dancer, wearing tight briefs)

5 - Attempt by a ""Kinsey 6"" at a Heterosexual lifestyle.

6 - Consideration of enrollment in a Gay Conversion Therapy program.

7 - Time spent in cleaning up all the Holy Mess....created by Items 1 thru 6, above.

8 - THE END

4496473,5,B004XKUFY4,"You Should Meet My Son is one of the funniest and nicest gay comedy I have recently seen, probably the best of 2011. I'm quite surprise this movie was not more on the word of mouth of my friends, since it's not easy to do satira on gay themes with such touch of elegance. True, the storyline is excessive, but that is what satira is.

Brian is 30 years old and in the closet, or at least he is when he goes to friday dinner to his mother's home. He has a steady relationship with Dennis, who pretends to be his roommate. Brian's mother, Mae, is so out of the real world that she doesn't even consider the idea his son is gay until one of the candidate girl she brought to him doesn't enlighting her.

Here Mae's character, so as that of her sister Rose, turn into wonderful when they set out to find Brian the perfect husband, above all when his relationship with Dennis ends up in a bad way.

This is truly a movie about Mae and Rose more than Brian. I really like how Mae, not only understands what is better for his son Brian, but also tries to help other young boys, like she probably would have done for her son if he had the courage to tell her.

The supporting characters are all pretty good, I love the leather-couple, and Chase, the chosen husband, is cute with that big brownie eyes, and strange to say, he is even better when he is dressed ;-)

Aside from the jokes, this is a movie whose only fault is to try to do its best with the little budget it had. The plot is very good, the actors above the average, and the few sets carefully chosen. Sure, it shows the limited budget, but most of the time you forget it, involved as you are in the adventures of two middle-age women in search of true love... for their dear boy.",1309305600,22,1733,4.176646706586826
4496474,1,B004XKUFY4,"I really wanted to like this movie; bolstered by the good reviews here and a cute trailer, I decided to purchase it in order to support indie GLBT cinema.  The movie starts out promising, but quickly dovetails into a very bad and nonesensical remake of Auntie Mame (which one character lampshades (i.e., admits in the film)). The film devolves into a shrill whirlwind of tired jokes and stereotypes with far too much going on-screen.  Part of my disappointment also stems from a somewhat misleading title.  What I presumed to be a gay romantic-comedy from the title and trailer is nothing of the sort. This would be fine, but what exists as a plot insults the intelligence. Things happen for the sake of moving the plot along, rather than for any reason for those things happening.  Decisions are made with very little or no rationale or reason and none of the characters evolve beyond two dimensional cardboard cutouts.  I wanted a fun, light movie with a bit of a romantic edge; unfortunately, this movie has none of that.  My advice: watch Auntie Mame instead.",1309219200,13,1063,4.781420765027322
4496475,4,B004XKUFY4,"Director/writer Keith Hartman's charming comedy, about a mother's unconditional love for her gay son, quickly became an award-winning favorite at several gay film festivals. And it's easy to see why.
  At first, Southern mama Mae (Joanne McGee) is horrified to learn that her beloved only son Brian (Stewart Carrico) is ""you know""...gay. Mae and Brian haven't been communicating at all. Despite the fact that he's had a five year relationship with his ""room-mate"" Dennis (Brett Holland) , Brian can't bear to tell her he's gay, for fear she'll need CPR. And if he can't tell her he's gay, he can't tell her he is heartbroken after Dennis leaves him. Mae learns the truth after her spinster sister Rose (Carol Goans) completes a gay quiz in ""Glamour""  magazine. After some over-the-top wailing (""I should never have let Brian watch ""The Wizard Of Oz""...it has Judy Garland"") and a visit to an ""ex-gay"" church program, Mae and Rose decide they love Brian just the way he is. From then on, they are women on a mission...to find Brian Mr. Right.
  It is hard to believe that Mae and Rose are as clueless as they initially are... not only about Brian, but about everything! These women have never heard of the Internet. And they haven't been downtown in twenty years. Yet, the scenes of Rose and Mae's first day on the Internet and first night of ""man-hunting"" at a gay bar are absolutely hilarious. Rose takes a wrong turn at the gay bar and drag-queen Salsa (Matt Palazzolo) exclaims ""Oh Grandma, ""The Sound Of Music"" look is so over!"", just before giving her a mini-makeover.
  In this breezy 85 minute movie, the characters undergo some drastic and hasty behavioral changes. The movie itself also makes a rather dizzy transition from funny comedy to full-on farce in the vein of ""Auntie Mame.""  But, on the whole, the overall movie works. McGee and Goans give especially endearing performances. It also doesn't hurt that Stewart Carrico is gorgeous and easy on the eyes. The equally dreamy Steve Snyder plays Chase, the guy you  WISH Brian will get a clue about and hurry up and hook up with. The diverting ensemble cast also includes Ginger Pullman, Acquah Dansoh, Chris Nolan and Leif Holt.
  Keith Hartman's strength as a director/writer is that he goes for honest laughs instead of cheap ones. The humor is never at the expense of the characters. We laugh with the characters, but never at them. Hartman knows there must be humanity underneath farce in order for farce to work. The most touching moment occurs late in the film when Mae tells Brian, ""I want you to be happy... and if you're not happy in this world, I will change the world. But I will not have the world change you!"" That is the kind of unconditional,  loving response every gay and lesbian individual hopes to receive from their parents, friends, loved ones, etc., but seldom do. ""My Son"" presents the world as it should be, instead of how it is.  In this case, a farce-fantasy  is not a bad thing at all. The film offers hope and, with its head and heart in exactly the right place, is especially heartwarming.",1309132800,9,3081,4.713221601489758
