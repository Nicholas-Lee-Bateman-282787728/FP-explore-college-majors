7809127,5,6301025059,"This movie is pretty good and underrated. The best part of pretty much the whole movie is Jenny Lewis. She's pretty good in this. I'm watching this movie right now. Beverly D'Angelo and Raul Julia are pretty good too. One of the best lines is ""Tomorrow is the beginning of the rest of your life"". I also like the scene on the beach. The bar scene where Julia ""accidently"" ripped off D'Angelo's clothes was pretty hilarious. The setting goes good for 1957 in Florida as well. In fact, It's so good, I'm just gonna stop writing this review right now so I can get back to watching it. Recommended. It's not on DVD yet and may never be, so if you can find a copy, get it!",1206835200,2,667,4.25984251968504
7809128,5,6301025059,"This film was one of Julia's earliest.  He is young & sweet as a fired  pitcher who doesn't know how to do anything but play ball.  Wandering  around, fishing, hanging out in bars & cheap motels,  Mr. Julia is a  lonely soul.  At one cheap motel, he meets a huge fan: a kid who's  collected baseball cards & recognizes Julia from her collection.  The  girl's Mom (played wonderfully by Beverly D'Angelo) is a singer in dive  bars, hoping to be discovered some day.  She & her daughter live in a  trailer near the motel where Julia is staying.  A ""big break"" for  D'Angelo's character requires her to leave town for a few days.  She asks  Julia to babysit & he agrees, entertaining the young girl by reading  the sports pages to her.  Julia & the young girl work together so well  you'd think they were father & daughter.  However, D'Angelo's  ex-husband complicates this sweet friendship.  D'Angelo & Julia  together are like firecrackers on Cinquo de Mayo.  A happy ending at an  alligator farm comes after misfortune & mishaps.  Please buy this film.  The great (and much too soon departed) Raul Julia is endearing in this  low-budget, big hearted film.  END",907632000,11,1160,4.655
