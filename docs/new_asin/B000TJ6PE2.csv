Being on a DVD-R didn't help much either.",1255305600,2,234,3.68

The main reason to see it is because it stars the very talented and very beautiful Carole Landis. This is one of the last movies she made before her tragic death in 1948. Carole plays a singer who gets involved with the theft of a valuable brass monkey. She gives a wonderful performance which shows she could have a had a long career. Brass Monkey is a mystery but there is also a lot of singing and laughs. Caroll Levis and Terry Thomas play themselves in the film. The highlight is getting to see Carole sing the haunting ""I Know Myself Too Well"". If you are a fan of Carole Landis this is a movie you must see. If you are not a fan of Carole you need to watch this movie and see why she was such an amazing star!",1190592000,11,878,4.140350877192983
