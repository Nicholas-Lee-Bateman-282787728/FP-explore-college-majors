5358100,5,B009NT0J9Q,"Grew up with my mom and sister watching musicals, ended up hating them. This is one that I can relate to with the best music that I listened to in my teens. Brought back fond memories.",1389052800,,184,4.138888888888889
5358101,5,B009NT0J9Q,"I don't know what it is about this movie, but I have to admit that I have watched it several times. Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx was too much and so perfect. The music brings back memories, along with the big hair and the clothes. High school in the 80's. For whatever reason I enjoy this movie every time I watch it.
Lots of people don't like this movie. No substance, blah, blah, blah. Technology has ruined peoples ability to just enjoy something for what it is. If there's no action or car chases or gun fights or fist fights then the movie can't be good. Watch this movie and just have fun remembering the 80's- the clothes, the hair, the rock and roll. Put down the damn smart phone and just enjoy it for it's simplicity.",1371945600,15,724,4.291970802919708

5358108,4,B009NT0J9Q,"I bought this dvd of Rock of Ages after seeing the shorter version, thinking that the extended version would be better.  Not so.  Now I know how film editors earn their money
The shorter version is tight, cohesive and entertaining.  The extended version bogs down in the additional material that adds nothing to the storyline.
I wish I had never seen this, let alone bought it.",1511568000,,377,4.681818181818182

5358132,5,B009NT0J9Q,A guilty pleasure musical based in the box office Broadway hit show. The movie is filled and often intertwined together with '80's hair metal hit classics sung by a stellar cast using their own voices given the '80's hair metal fans a new reason why they loved these songs to begin with.,1476748800,,287,4.538461538461538
