8342187,2,B001TOE8J0,"Was hoping to learn a little more.  The voice over was not always with what was happening on the screen.  I turned down the volume and just
tried to find something new to learn.",1483920000,,177,4.176470588235294
8342188,1,B001TOE8J0,"This is one of the most boring massage videos I ever rented. This was the most basic, relaxing massage, delivered in the most boring, common way.  It gave very little instruction, showed few strokes...it was just unimaginative, and boring and I saw nothing that made it a ""sport"" massage.",1404172800,,288,4.877551020408164
8342189,5,B001TOE8J0,"Return customer!

I bought other videos from this company so I just decided for cheaper to rent and watch them all.  It was a cheaper alternative to buying all the DVDs.  I really liked it.  So, I'd have to recommend it too.",1310774400,,224,4.261904761904762
8342190,3,B001TOE8J0,"This video is a good introduction to sports massage.  What frustrated me about this video was the angle of the camera work.  Often times when the technique was being demonstrated what you saw was the back of the massage therapist instead of the hands/arms doing the work.  While the narrator was describing the technique the camera was showing the back instead of quickly showing the hands doing the technique, in other words, too much lag time.  Clean this up and this would be a very good introduction to sports massage.",1238371200,3,522,4.766666666666667
