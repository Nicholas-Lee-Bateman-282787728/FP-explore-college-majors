8513437,5,B007AJSVZ0,"I perform Yang style but found this video very useful in learning the basic basics of Chen style, which is much more flowing than Yang.  In fact, I've incorporated the flowing style of Chen movements into my daily Yang forms because it makes the more formal movements of Yang just flow better.  I plan to continue learning Chen after I'm comfortable with the short version presented in this video.  In the meantime, my Yang form is much more free-flowing than what I'm sure Yang purists would allow.  But I'm not restricted by hidebound tradition and feel the Chen silk reeling style adds so much to how I do Yang now.  After all, it's all Tai Chi, baby.",1444003200,2,654,4.555555555555555
8513438,5,B007AJSVZ0,"There's aren't enough great things I can say about Sifu Ken
and his amazing Chen Tai Chi, Ba Gua, and Xing Yi training videos.

If you are looking for a DVD that breaks down the Chen 19 Form move by
move, this is the DVD to get.

I learned the form strictly from this DVD and learned
it pretty well.

As a veteran student of the Chinese Martial Arts who
formally trained in Northern Praying Mantis Kung Fu
and Yang Style Tai Chi for several years, I don't but
into the nonsense that you can't learn from a DVD. You certainly
can if you are DISCIPLINED and DEDICATED.

Learning from a DVD definitely takes time, patience, and lots of rewinding,
but it can be done. And Sifu Ken's Internal Martial Arts DVDs are a great place to
start especially if you live in an area which doesn't have many
Internal instructors or classes.

I will say that for anyone interested in learning Chen 19 or any
other Chen styles it is IMPERATIVE to learn and study Silk Reeling.

The Silk Reeling is what differentiates Chen from the Yang, Wu and Sun styles,
and is the foundation of all things Chen.",1427846400,6,1079,4.37
8513439,5,B007AJSVZ0,"As far as instructional Tai Chi videos go, this is about as good as it gets.  While not a master or grandmaster, Ken Gullette has trained with some of the best of them from the Chen lineage, and going through this DVD is very much like being in a real Chen Taiji class.  While you can't replace having a teacher to work with in-person, Ken puts enough explanation into the movements to give beginning students a lot to work with.  Supplement with one of the many good books on Chen internal principles (as every good student should anyhow) and you can really gain a great deal of knowledge from this instructional.

I learned half of the form from a teacher and the other half from this DVD.  It is slower to learn this way, but it can be done!  I suggest going through each movement with the DVD remote nearby, focusing on one hand or foot at a time for each movement.  Repetition brings rewards as you go through this kind training.

If you have no teacher around you this is probably the single best DVD for learning the Chen 19 form.  If you DO have a teacher to work with, this DVD will help you get further in the form faster, so your teacher can spend more time on mechanical corrections and less on teaching the moves.",1426032000,2,1226,4.342105263157895
