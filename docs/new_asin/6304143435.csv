8637380,4,6304143435,The information contained on this video is valuable.  Although the 90's production style is dated the information is not.  This video is especially valuable for people with shy or difficult to handle cats.  There is a feature towards the end that is really informative for anyone dealing with shelter cats.  In using this technique I've turned our very skiddish and shy cat into a total love.  Before using the Ttouch she would hide and coward and now she confidentlly roles on her back and lets me Ttouch her belly. Thank you Linda Tellington-Jones for this amazing knowledge.,1081900800,6,577,4.907216494845361
8637381,5,6304143435,This video showed me a new way to touch and communicate with my cats. The subtitles and close up camera angles of the touches really helped me put them to practice on my own cats. Also a plus is Linda's explanation of the technique and purpose of each one. I liked watching the actual affects of the touches on several diffferent cats with several different personalities. My cats and I are excited to add this to my video collection.,1074384000,4,434,4.506329113924051
