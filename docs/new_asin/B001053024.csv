Along with the obvious,his humor,Craig Ferguson goes to different parts of Scotland, talking to people who are experts on their particular area, walking the ground he's talking about. There's also quite a bit of local history included, which makes it even more interesting. All in all, well worth the money spent buying and the time spent watching.",1245801600,10,431,5.084507042253521
3047802,5,B001053024,"More than 15 years ago (as is apparent from seeing how much younger he was) the Scottish Conan guy Craig Ferguson hosted an archaeological TV show in Scotland.

This six part series just recently came out on DVD in American format. It is really fun to watch. It is interesting from the standpoint of seeing things like the best preserved 5,000 year old Neolithic settlement in Europe. Even back then Craig Ferguson marched to the beat of a different drummer, and he is funny to watch.

These DVDs do not have subtitles. Even though Craig Ferguson and all the people he interviews are speaking the Queen's English, I do miss some of the words. And this is coming from a guy who owns (and wears) a real honest Scottish kilt which I bought in Scotland. And not at some tourist shop either. I have travelled widely in Scotland on several different occasions. Even so, my DVD player remote control is getting a good workout, rewinding a little and listening to a phrase or sentence again.

I recommend this set of DVDs to anyone who likes archaeology, likes Scotland, or is a fan of Craig Ferguson.",1245024000,26,1093,4.5948717948717945

Professors and ministers help you understand what you are seeing. Craig Ferguson has the just right sense of humor to not take himself or the topic too seriously. You realize the Scots are making an effort to recognize, study and take care of their history while living in the present. You see how rocks have been moved and recycled for reuse in new buildings. You visit the Antoine ""wall"" and the remains of Roman forts. Scottish weather comes through - cold and windy.",1236902400,16,589,4.841584158415841

8237132,5,B001053024,"I got this for Christmas a couple years ago and I've probably nearly worn out the CDs at this point. I love this show. Craig is as adorable as ever - spunky and lovable as you'd expect (And sober, for those fans who wonder if this was before or after he got clean)
And honestly I've learned a lot about Scotland history through this. He explains so fantastically well. He teaches you what he's saying in a fun way that you're bound to remember. Even after the first time I watched it, even though I was drooling over how adorable he was, I still walked away having learned about things.
So yes. This is a fantastic DVD set. Especially for anyone who likes Craig. but honestly I think anyone would enjoy this",1372982400,,707,4.363636363636363

8237134,5,B001053024,"This simple DVD is interesting, educational and quietly humorous.  Various topics of Scotland's history, geography and culture are presented by Craig Ferguson, late night talk-show host of The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson.  Select bits of Scottish history are discussed and shown on-site where events occurred, but in a fun, interesting way.  We enjoyed it.",1328745600,,363,5.446428571428571

8237136,5,B001053024,"While low budget, but, well done early Ferguson entry into the Cannon of Craig.  Written and ""Presented"" by Ferguson in the early 90's, for BBC Scotland, this is a great introduction to Scottish history from an archeological slant.  Visits to Iona, Shetland- Skara Brae as well as roman and medieval sites.  His humor shines through as well as an intellectual curiosity.  He truly listens to those interviewed and yet remains cheeky.  He also sports an awsome outfit that is braveheart, meets highlander, meets mad max with Byron thrown in (not to mention great hair) ...  In other words, really a feast for the eyes and the brain (as usual).",1303257600,2,642,4.844036697247707
8237137,3,B001053024,"3.5 stars.  OK, I confess that it wasn't a burning interest in Pictish culture that prompted me to check this out. As a recent convert to the Tribe of Ferguson, I was just trying to get my hands on anything he appears in. In this 1993 low-budget (and I really do mean it) documentary offering from Scottish television, we are treated to young-turk Craig as a shaggy-haired, ear-studded 30-year-old looking like a cross between a Flock of Seagulls concert attendee and an escapee from the Renaissance Faire. His rangy kinetic energy, craggy Celtic looks (far less craggy) and manic comic persona are all here, though the comic mania has been admirably tamped down due to the seriousness of the subject at hand.  The tone is a bit all over the place; turns out that the Craig persona does not blend easily with scholarly sound bites by professorial types, but who cares?  Craig is such a unique screen presence, especially with a long black coat flapping behind him as he strides all over the rain-soaked Scottish countryside, it's a feast of images the Ferguson fan won't want to miss.  Craig's gifts extend even to finding phone boxes in the most unlikely areas.

Depending on your enthusiasm for looking at moss-covered stones, carvings, old pots and the like, you may find the subject matter enthalling, but I was more interested in this as a study of the Comic as a Young Man. Craig wrote all this material in addition to performing on-camera duties, an early indication that this professional clown who never graduated from high school posesses an intellectual curiosity and heft that runs surprisingly broad and deep. This series is only recently available on DVD, no doubt due to Craig's raised stature as Scotland's greatest export to America since shortbread. Serious Pictish scholars will want to look elsewhere as this is only the ""Cliffs Notes History of Scotland"", but it's a must-see for Ferguson scholars, if only to poke fun at Craig's wardrobe.",1272931200,13,1960,4.891566265060241
8237138,5,B001053024,"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on CBS (Monday-Friday 12:37AM EST) has generated a lot of interest in the man who entertains us with his unique brand of humor five nights a week. His current show may be the first opportunity many of us have had to see him, unless you were previously a fan of the Drew Carey Show. But here's a series that gives you a better idea of the versatility of this man.  In 1993, Craig Ferguson was contracted to do ""The Dirt Detective"" for Scottish Television.  The show, which Ferguson wrote and presents, explores the history of Scotland, beginning with the Stone Age and moving up to more recent times.  Ferguson's personality shines through and adds warmth and humor to the already fascinating subject he covers. I think you'll enjoy the unique look and somewhat mystical feel of the show as well. I highly recommend it to Craig Ferguson fans and history buffs alike.",1264809600,3,904,4.672955974842767
8237139,4,B001053024,"A very young Craig Ferguson, before he developed the polished persona that he has today.  However, I see the early techniques in this program that he uses on his current show (feet on the desk at the end of the show, etc).
It's a nice personal touch to an archaeological study of Scotland.  I like that he put his father in one scene.  I thought that was sweet.  I just enjoyed the experience!",1253145600,8,393,4.342465753424658
8237140,5,B001053024,"I LOVE this DVD!
It is a bit like a home movie in some ways,rather low budget. However, there is a charm to that, in that it doesn't NEED to be high tech, and we are drawn in to the subject matter, and the very charming host. Ferguson is very real and very enthusiastic. For those of us fascinated with Scotland and obscure history, this is highly entertaining and informative.",1252886400,2,377,4.4
