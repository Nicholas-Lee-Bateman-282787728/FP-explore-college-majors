8535796,5,B000H8RZLW,"""Speaking with God"" is a fascinating and well shot documentary about Mossi divination. While the film itself gives viewers a ""behind the scenes"" look at Mossi religious practices, the narrative by Dr. Christopher Roy explains the entire process, and provides insights on the meanings behind what the viewer sees. I especially liked the interview with the Mossi diviner, who explains in his own words the history of Baga divination, as well as his background as a religious leader. The film documents the entire process, beginning with the diviner putting on his costume, through the actual performance itself. This film is a great resource because it allows viewers to ""experience"" the performance, including the sounds, movements and community participation. These key aspects are lost when viewing a slide or printed image, but the film captures all of them! It is an interesting and entertaining film that could be enjoyed by any audience.",1209772800,2,942,5.245033112582782
