1924877,5,B0000DI88E,"When the creators of the show, Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynne

came up with the idea for ""Yes, Minister"" in the 1970's, they

wondered whether a comedy consisting entirely of ""elderly men sitting around talking about government"" would go over with the viewers.  In fact they created one of the greatest comedy programs of all time.  Of course, the casting was a major factor, and they had the good luck to come up with such a magnificent cast.  What is interesting is that for Nigel Hawthorne (Sir Humphrey Appleby), this was his first real success in the world of acting although he was around 50 years of age at the time, so this program's creators saw the potential in him that so many others missed.  It is absolutely amazing how he is able to memorize and recite with a straight face so many unbelievably long and convoluted sentences that are one of the trademarks of this show. Paul Eddington (Jim Hacker) was, on the other hand a well known actor, and he is able to go from being befuddled to well-meaning to conniving in a single episode.

Derek Fowlds (Bernard Wooley-a funny name) is also good as Hacker's personal secretary.

I mention in the title that the program is depressing because one sees how politicians take the public's tax money and use it to pay off other politicians in order to thwart the best interests of those taxpayers.  In one of the supplements to the DVD discs there are interviews with real British politicians of the 1970's and 1980's and they say that the program does reflect much of the reality of politics, but it is not quite a cynical as is reflected in the show.  In any event, if viewers develop

a better understanding of politics and it motivates them to get involved to keep the politicians on the level, then the world is not getting just entertainment from this series.

There may be some confusion in the program for people who are not British because of the lingo peculiar to British Politics (e.g. repeated references to ""Number 10"" which means the Prime Minister's Office) or various historical events or personalities in British political history which the viewer may be unaware of.

My favorite line is stated by a character who had been an MP in the House of Commons and was given a peerage so he moved over to the House of Lords.  When asked what he thought of the change, he replied ""I've gone from the animals to the vegetables!"".

1924878,5,B0000DI88E,"This is a HILARIOUS sitcom from Britain from the late 1980's-early 1990's. It is full of very sarcastic, cynical humor between the antagonist bureaucrats against [Prime] Minister Hacker, who is only trying to reform Britain in ways he believes would be improvements. It does take some knowledge/appreciation of government--particularly the British--to fully get the most out of the jokes though. Namely, British ministers are assigned cabinet levels as status symbols, not for any particular background in the field, so they are often at the mercy of the ""lifers"" that staff the ministry--meanwhile, the former are often due to change within a couple of years at most, so the Secretaries tend to just go around them ayways. Second, the British Parliament is much more closed and secretive than the American government. With these in mind, my two favorite jokes come from the first episode ""Open Government"" on the original ""Yes, Minister"" disc:
""There are 2 types of chairs for two types of ministers: the kind that are very rigid but fold up, and the kind that are soft and go round-and-round in circles""
and
""He is trying to create an open government""
""That's proposterous! You can either have 'OPENESS' or you can have 'GOVERNMENT'!""",1078617600,9,1236,5.093596059113301

This sitcom was brilliantly written, expertly acted and offered some of the most intelligent dialogue you will ever hear on a sitcom (you could study for your SATs listening to Sir Humphrey and Bernard Woolley--and the minister, to a lesser extent).  Who says you need scantily-clad women and off color jokes to make great comedy.  Three middle aged men talking government did quite nicely.
The first set includes 21 episodes on four discs with photos on the inside of the case.  It also offers a touching 47-minute tribute to Nigel Hawthorne. Anyone who has read Hawthorne's autobio Straight Face will recognize some of the people and places featured in this documentary.  The second set offers 17 episodes on three discs including the 1-hour Christmas special ""Party Games"" aired in 1984 showing the political intrigue leading the way for Jim Hacker to become Prime Minister.

1924883,5,B0000DI88E,"The three excellent actors, Paul Eddington, Nigel Hawthorne and Derek Fowlds, in those two long running (several if not many years) mini series, are absolutely flabbergasting.

The subject is simple. Jim Hacker, a Member of Parliament, becomes minister and later he will become prime minister. Banal. But what is less banal is the encounter of this newly appointment minister and later prime minister with the permanent secretary of his ministry first, Sir Humphrey, and cabinet secretary later when Jim Hacker moves to 10 Downing Street.

Sir Humphrey, a knighted civil servant, is the most beautiful exemplar of the civil service functionaries: red tape, corporatism, elitism, systematic maneuvers and manipulations of ministers, prime ministers and other political officials to make them do what they, the civil servants, want them, the ministers and prime ministers, to do on any subject.

And the subjects evoked in these numerous episodes of this political saga are quite evocative of corruption and aristocratism if not feudalism, and at the same time marvelously funny. It is true Bernard, the private secretary of Jim Hacker, a civil servant too but with a corrosive sense of black humor, is always there for a side remark that is superbly funny, like when the French President is trying to smuggle a dog into Great Britain in his diplomatic luggage, suitcase, briefcase or whatever. And Bernard to suggest a ""doggy bag"".

At the same time this wit, this humor, this brilliant never ending linguistic, situational and existential irony, sarcasm or fun deals with fundamental problems.

First of all the dictatorship of the civil service. The top civil servants are paid more than the ministers and prime ministers they serve and as such, as much as out of a feudal tradition, they are knighted and pretend to really manage the country in any way possible. This red tape defending privileges and rejecting the people into some kind of distant mist is a real problem in any democracy where politicians change but civil servants do not.

Then education, real estate speculation, military expenditures and waste, foreign shady business if not plain behind the scene affairs, terrorism, the health service, the press and its passive or active manipulation or being manipulated in all directions possible, the blackmail of the ministers by the civil service or of the civil servants by the ministers, religion, universities, culture and so many other real concrete problems turned into a farce by the civil service and turned into a grotesque episode of political bravery by the politicians.

This political satire and these caustic misrepresenting burlesque parodies of real life are a masterpiece in the field and is duly signed BBC. That kind of burlesque is no longer possible anywhere in the world with that finesse, that bright expertise and it is able to shame any other attempt from anywhere in the world because it is absolutely flippant and foolish but on subjects that are hefty and heavy and the moral of the story is not just fun but it is also ethics, ethical behavior and how it is possible to mend that frozen system into some thawing action.

There is one limit and apparently only one: the queen and the crown and the royal family, royalty (but of course not royalties) and the monarchy are not supposed even to be evoked in any funny way. The rare mentions of the crown are always to remind us this crown is the standard by which ethics should be measured, the model for all politicians, the norm of all action.

Of course the Queen is in no way present, even as a picture in these episodes, and her only appearances is a few times as a stamp on a letter, and no close-up view of it, of course not.

Enjoy that marvelous buffoonery that is as light as air and as deep as the sea.

1924893,5,B0000DI88E,"I won't go in to lengthy details about how funny these series and how despite being just over a decade old they are refreshingly funny and ironically although sadly still as relevant today as when they were first made! What is truly amazing is as you watch the series over and over how much more funny it becomes as you watch Sir Humpy oops Humphrey a master of the most British of oratory skills-- obsufication, tangle and fight with the politically administratively naive Hacker

A few notes to my American brothers and sisters who are watching this whether they be neophytes or have seen the show before as they are some cultural differences here which make the humour oops humor puzzling

a) LSE the London School of Economics, the civil service believes that the only two true British schools are Oxford and Cambridge

b) 1st == summa cum claude, 2nd (or more accurately an upper 2nd) magna cum laude, lower 2nd == cum laude

c) unlike here in the US regrettably I might add civil servants unlike federal servants or appointees cannot in general be dismissed especially if they have vaunted 'tenure' or are appointed only in the case of blatant sexual misconduct and for convictions for crimes (and even then it's not easy)

d) remember this was originally written in 78-79 then released in the 80's when M Thatcher was reforming the civil service and so doesn't reflect her stay but her various predecessors

e) BE glad you guys don't have to put up with the 'creative inertia' of the civil service

That said the writing is smart and funny and not just from Sir Humphrey the self effacing and deferential 'humble' civil, all of the characters including Hacker, his wife and his political advisor(s) all say very hilarious and true statements about the nature of the political system within a parliamentary (NOT republican) frame work

This is truly a joy to watch and for those you who suffer from linguistic trepidation and verbal inflexibility let the writer of this review who deigns never to use the 'perpendicular pronoun' warn to have a dictionary or thesaurus handy as the word play is often sharp even when perfunctory

1924897,5,B0000DI88E,"These series rate right up there with the best of the BBC. If you're an action kind of person, though, this is not for you.

Who knew 'boring old white men' just talking could be so funny? And, a series about government where hardly anything ever happens? That is to say - lots gets talked about and people (mostly the Minister/Prime Minister and his political advisers) TRY to change things but are stubbornly opposed at every turn by the bureaucracy, so most of the programs end with a reassertion of the status quo. I would find this frustrating in real life but enjoy every moment of it in these programs.

When I first saw some of the programs, I was dazzled by Nigel Hawthorne's ability to whip out the bureaucracy-speak without getting tongue-tied. Now, owning the whole of both series, I am getting very fond of Paul Eddington's fumbling and bumbling. Some of his facial expressions are priceless. We've lost two of the great ones with the passing of Eddington and Hawthorne.

One final thing I have come to appreciate is how timeless the series is. Of course, there's the odd mention of years, but the writers have cleverly avoided mentioning the current day politicians or issues (except for one program about negotiating with the French over the Chunnel - before it was built) that would anchor the programs in one time period. These series are as relevant today as they were 20-odd years ago when they were being made.

Highly recommended.

I am not as familiar with the inter-workings of the English governmental system, but that does not take away from my enjoyment of this show.  The characters are funny in the extreme of their perspective, but also seem so real.  Each has its turn to be comical, insightful and the brunt of someone else's humor.  Sometimes they twist circumstances to their favor and sometimes they work together for their mutual good. They did often use the humor in long-winded ways to say a thought which could have been shared in much fewer words, but not so over-done as to take away from the humor.

I doubt such thing can be ever aired on the American Television.  The storyboard is relatively simple for someone who is adherent to political intrigue. The whole fabric of our society is challenged. The politics of religion, education, unemployment, arts, literature, media, newspaper and yes even the science of creating heroes is portrayed with unerring clarity and depth.  The tragic thing about this series is that Jim Hacker really wants to make things better. In the beginning he is adamant to bring good for the humanity. But over again and again he cut short, far short of even starting. Yes Minister not only resembles a novel by Kafka, but rather it is.

I wish they had made more of the episodes. It is an absolute tragedy that such masterpiece have only about 40 episodes while garbage like Seinfeld and cheers have volumes and volumes dedicated to them.

A thumping good show!",1129593600,8,1093,4.939890710382514
1924918,5,B0000DI88E,"Believe-it-or-not, humour without vulgarity, popularity without beautiful people or nudity.
This great British comedy serial is possibly the single best TV serial of all time.
The performances by Paul Eddington (as the bumbling, bumptious but likeable Minister & then Prime Minister), Derek Fowlds (as his very likeable Private Secretary), and of course Nigel Hawthorne (as the supercilious, conniving & of course hugely entertaining Permanent Secretary) were all outstanding. It was unfair in the extreme, incidentally, that only two of the three (Eddington & Hawthorne) were awarded OBE's for their performances, but poor Derek Fowlds wasn't.
The scriptwriters excelled themselves, producing an absolutely fascinating insight into the world of British beuraucracy, yet managing a laugh a second.
The production values were outstanding, as was the supporting cast.
Even twentyfive years later, this serial remains entirely up-to-date, and could well have been written just last month.
All-in-all, a rare gem, and a must-have for any DVD collection.",1125619200,19,1049,5.774193548387097

8001063,5,B0000DI88E,"I used to watch this series on WGBH Boston. English humour is a learned trait,I must say. They seem to be describing something American but trying to institutionalize it under their system. There's something to be said about doing something right the first time,but aren't we trying to be entertained. Getting too serious,could cause one to throw themselves into their work. Is it possible that what they are describing could have power in our government here in the USA?What ever gave you that idea?What would these people look like and how do they justify their actions when they're running for office at the same time?The people that are trying to protect them also are looking for counterfeit money. That is truly funny. This was in the eighties though. It's sort of like getting Tom Snyder to interview a Minister of the Crown that don't like Greeks. He does press him on this. What does a Greek get for somebody that certainly won't appreciate it?Worry beads?",1433289600,,965,4.8545454545454545

8001068,5,B0000DI88E,"PBS is largely a waste of taxpayer money, but they did us a big favor in bringing this to the States. ""Frasier"" was a good comedy, but not the most sophisticated comedy, as it came to be known. That distinction belongs to ""Yes Minister/Yes Prime Minister."" It's hilarious, and there's plenty of bonus features in this set to boot.",1397952000,,330,4.610169491525424
