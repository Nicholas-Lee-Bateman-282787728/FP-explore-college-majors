8344406,4,B0016GOOPO,"One of Shyam Benegal's finest work, this movie is about a Portugal family in Goa and their struggle to come in terms with the death of the head of the family, all amidst the backdrop of an Indian army assembled to attack and take over Goa. The movie will make you experience the Goan Portuguese culture, their lifestyle, their music (watch out for the young Remo Fernandez and Alisha Chennai in 1985), and in the end, you feel as if you have actually experienced the entire happening. The costumes, the names, the behavior of the characters are all very authentic, and one thing is for sure, the next time you are in Goa, you will pause and think for a second about its unique and diverse culture and the place it holds in the Indian history.",1300060800,3,742,4.463235294117647
