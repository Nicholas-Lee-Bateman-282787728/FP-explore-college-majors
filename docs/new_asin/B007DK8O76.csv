5079306,3,B007DK8O76,"I had read about this film and had always wanted to see it.  It turns out that it was not especially good but that's OK.  As many classic US films are not available in the US, I often buy ""foreign"" versions which typically are just the English versions with optional language and subtitles.  This film, however, was disappointing in that although there is a menu that ""seems"" to let you select language and subtitles, the menu really doesn't work -- the DVD is English audio with Castillian subtitles printed on the screen.

8515014,5,B007DK8O76,This is another great movie with Rosalind Russell and Fred MacMurray.  I'm assuming it is a take-off of Amelia Earhart.  The good guys win in the end.,1525305600,,150,4.518518518518518
8515015,3,B007DK8O76,"It's an okay film.  It's not the best from any of the actors involved but it lays down the basic Amelia Earhart was a spy mission mythos that has been around for nearly 80 years.  This most definitely qualifies as a wartime propaganda film with speculative arguments to earlier events that happened pre-war.  I honestly don't know if this film started those rumors or if they had been around since 1937/1938.  Contrary to what historical revisionists (and people who teach ""politically correct"" history) may have you believe, there WAS tension between the US and Japan back then AND the US Navy was NOT allowed to search in mandate area waters for the REAL Earhart after she disappeared...  Hmm, now why would THAT be?
The idea of an Earhart spy flight likely started AFTER this film was released and with the recovery of alleged luggage from the flight by US military forces on their island hopping campaign across the Pacific.  Ultimately, US forces discovered -- allegedly -- Earhart's plane on Saipan in June/July 1944 during the ""Pacific D-Day"" operations.  The recovery of her luggage is not widely known today but it WAS reported in contemporay articles in military newspapers and a few domestic newspapers during World War II.
The film itself has an interesting backstory to its production but like a lot of the Earhart story before and after her disappearance there is a bunch of a he-said, she-said with connections to Earhart's husband (George Putnam) and the husband of Earhart's best friend, Jackie Cochrane, Floyd Odlum.  Odlum had a HUGE interest in the RKO Studios which produced this film but apparently neither he nor Putnam had anything directly to do with the production other than that they were aware of it.
The interest in the film, the reason WHY it didn't disappear into oblivion like many wartime films did, is of course the Earhart connection.  Clips of the film were used in a 1975 episode of the ""In Search of"" paranormal series about Amelia Earhart which was hosted by the late Leonard Nimoy.  The film itself figured in and provided plot points for the 1970 book, Amelia Earhart Lives which was widely debunked by most Earhart researchers.  The ""Gull Island"" mentioned in the film is likely the Hull Island the later book (again, debunked by serious researchers) mentions as a crash spot for Earhart.  There was a blurry photo (debris from a plane that was NOT the Electra) promoted as ""proof positive"" that the Electra crashed there!  It's worth noting the Tonie Carter character in the film DOES NOT end up landing on ""Gull Island"" but I won't spoil a major plot point for people interested in the movie!
The DVD itself is typical for Warner Collection DVD releases.  It's actually printed on DVD-R media and is a bare-bones release with allegedly no attempt at restoration.  It's doubtful this film will EVER get a proper hi-def video release unless another company licenses it from Warner Bros and does a restored, hi-def remaster.  It was last released on home video on VHS in the late 1980s to my knowledge.
<Sigh> If you want extras or more backstory on this film, you'll have to read it about in books or online.  It's a darn shame because the Earhart story is interesting in and of itself.  Mike Campbell's books, those of the late Thomas Devine and Fred Goerner, are the best starting points to inform yourself of what actually happened.  I'd actually recommend reviewing the ""In Search of"" episode to see how the movie tied in with later books about Earhart's disappearance and its impact on pop culture perceptions of Earhart.  There is no definitive documentary (or great movie, period) about Earhart's last flight to date because the ""bones as they were"" have not been discovered -- yet.  They are probably in a vault next to the Ark of the Covenant in government archives.",1524614400,,3818,4.8341013824884795
8515016,4,B007DK8O76,"I saw just a bit of it on TV and always wanted to see it all.  These forgotten movies make me itch to know what I've missed.  I'm fascinated by this period and this has a unique take on what people were thinking at the time.  A lot of really dull romance, though.  Let's say the sparks didn't fly and you wait for it to be over.",1494892800,,328,3.8507462686567164

8515019,5,B007DK8O76,"The movie was just as I remembered it from when I watched it as a kid.  Good airplane shots as this is a fictional account of Amelia Earhart and her rise to a celebrated pilot.  No one actually knows what exactly happened to her when she disappeared  in 1937, but the movie portrays one of those possible endings.",1441411200,,313,4.362068965517241

8515022,5,B007DK8O76,"I was VERY excited to obtain this long-unavailable film.  I knew Paul Mantz (Earhart's mentor), who is always included in Earhart films. The portrayal is as good or better than the others. The story is undocumented historical speculation.

The movie is obviously heavy with WWII anti-Japanese propaganda, which was appropriate for the times.

Russell is very good - McMurray was just OK.",1436140800,,387,5.209677419354839
8515023,5,B007DK8O76,"My favorite movie of all time. It doesn't get any better than this.
Rosalind Russell in a fictionalized version of the Amelia Earhart story. It hasn't been shown on TV in 30 years and until now, hasn't been available on DVD. There is hardly anybody alive anymore who has seen it or remembers it but it will tear your heart out.

Spoiler ahead...
Made during WWII with Fred MacMurray, it's romantic, funny, patriotic, and ultimately a tear jerker if you remember how Earhart ended up. For me, it's as good as ""Casablanca"", except better because Russell is in it. When is the last time you saw a movie where you really cared about the characters in it? You will here, don't miss it

Russell and MacMurray have great chemistry together. They were teamed together a couple years earlier in a stylish hit comedy ""Take a Letter Darling"" 1941. They're even better here. Also watch for some familiar faces in some very small parts. Chet Huntley of the NBC Huntley/Brinkley report can be seen on camera announcing the start of an air race. ""Leave it to Beaver"" Dad, Hugh Beaumont has a small part as a technician supervising a simulator test.

This lost treasure, hasn't been on TV in over 30 years. And it still doesn't have clearance rights for broadcast or cable TV. The only way to see this WWII romantic adventure is to buy it here.",1430438400,3,1328,4.594936708860759
