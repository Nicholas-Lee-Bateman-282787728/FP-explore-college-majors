It may say on the cover that you can change the Italian to English, but you can't.
What a waste of my money.",1416960000,,149,3.838709677419355
8464163,1,B005BQRMHM,"Imagine my delight when I found this British Agatha Christie mystery had been released in Italy on dvd. And with both an Italian & English soundtrack A solid cast with Cecily Courtneidge & Glynis Johns. Wow, I could hardly wait.

Well sadly the dvd arrived and there is no English soundtrack. There is not even an option to access alternative soundtracks or subtitles. And don't blame the sellers. The packaging clearly states it has both English & Italian sound. Unfortunately that is not the truth. The manufacturer has listed it as being with both languages. Perhaps if you can speak Italian it is fine, but if you are looking for the English sound version, look elsewhere, it isn't available on this.",1339632000,5,704,4.818181818181818
8464164,3,B005BQRMHM,"Having waited fifty years to see this since its initial cinema release in Australia I was very disappointed that it did not match the product description. There is no interactive menu (or it's very well hidden) and there are no subtitles (unless, they too are very well hidden). The DVD is only in Italian (very well dubbed I must add) and not in English as well. I've adored Glynis Johns since childhood and can watch her doing anything on screen, but it's a bit disconcerting to not understand what's going on. I know (or understand from the internet) that The Spider's Web was initially released in the USA as an episode of Kraft Mystery Theatre but this DVD is totally (including titles) in Italian and I can see no reference to this series in the DVD case. I don't know where this copy was sourced from but there appears to be bits missing (including the end titles). All in all, no problems with service and over all with the quality, but a bit sad nevertheless.",1325635200,6,968,4.537142857142857
