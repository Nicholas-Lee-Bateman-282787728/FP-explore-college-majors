4115723,3,B003EV5BLK,"I was not as happy with this relaxation DVD as I thought I would be.  Some of the music is actually irritating after a while, and the pictures are on the boring side.  I wish I had bought something else.",1357776000,2,203,4.05
4115724,5,B003EV5BLK,"I agree with all the five star reviews before me.  It's a great relaxation DVD. I purchased the DVD here, at Amazom, but I would suggest that you go to their website for other choices of relaxation DVDs.  Great service from Amazon and Zenchantment.",1339545600,4,248,4.613636363636363
4115725,4,B003EV5BLK,This video is very serene. It's like a great series of wallpaper for your tv screen. The music soothing. It's also nice to use while meditating.,1329782400,5,144,4.576923076923077
4115726,4,B003EV5BLK,I bought this for a friend with panic disorder and she enjoys the visual aspects of this DVD very much.  The music is also very calming.,1328140800,6,136,4.230769230769231
4115727,5,B003EV5BLK,"This Zen Garden DVD has made quite the impression on me. When it first arrived, I was surprised by the fact that it plays automatically without even as much as a menu to get in the way of my relaxation time! And relaxing it is, I find myself looking forward to enjoying it's peaceful sounds and after a long day of shuffling about and being a busy Mommy of a very active toddler! It's endless loop of calming, serene varying scenery gradually changes, which I love, and somehow despite there being many different types of scenes (water, landscape etc) they play long enough to satisfy my need for variety but without my anticipating a scene change, does that make sense? The transitions are timed so well I don't even notice the scene changing, I am that relaxed. It's like my left brain just takes a nap, lol. True to it's zen personality if you will, you can switch on the nature sounds with very holistic music/sounds accompanying, or just the nature sounds themselves with the audio button on the DVD remote without having to stop playing the loop. It took me a short while to figure this out, since I have never come across this feature in a DVD before and don't know what 99% of my DVD buttons are for to begin with! I actually contacted the company (Zenchantment) by email about this and received an almost instantaneous response back with the solution to my confusion, along with a warm note of thanks and appreciation I did not expect. I went to their website after receiving their email and being shocked at how kind and genuine they were, and found they have many more titles I wasn't aware of, such as a California Lighthouse DVD that shows the ocean and varying times of day with lighthouses, Cherry Blossoms ""Zen Garden 2"" which is one I must get soon, a really neat Golden Gate Bridge time lapse video again, that I want to get and others that I am now very interested in after contacting the company about the audio feature and realizing they not only make products that help us in our daily lives, but really want to be a positive force in the world, and it shows in how they conduct themselves. They were as true to their nature as could be, a company that truly practices what they preach. A great product with a unique identity if you will, and a company that deals with it's customers using the principles of their product: relaxed, uncommon, beautiful and calming. I am really satisfied with my purchase, and because of this encounter, will go out of my way to try their new products in the future! Thank you Zenchantment, for your care and warmth. ~J",1324944000,11,2573,4.523605150214593
4115728,5,B003EV5BLK,"This is my favorite in my collection of ambient and relaxation videos. I love everything about it, but mostly the way it makes me feel. Every time I put this on, all the worries of my day, the traffic noise, everything just goes away. The cinematography in HD format, the music and everything is just so perfect. Whenever I want to unwind I play this. Sometimes I even go to sleep with it looping all night. It acts like white noise to drown out the traffic and it fills my bedroom with lush, serene colors and sounds that make me feel very much at peace with the world. I have all the other videos from Zenchantment too. I can't wait for more to come out. I'll keep buying them all.",1316304000,9,683,4.2615384615384615
4115729,4,B003EV5BLK,"The music is very mellow. The shakuhachi is mild and sweet, but it doesn't drown out the sound of the water. I use this sometimes for meditation, and sometimes while reading.",1302912000,21,174,4.645161290322581
4115730,5,B003EV5BLK,"There are so many nature DVD's available today, and yet the one I was looking for totally eluded me until now. This DVD has an essence of such peace and tranquility you feel like you are sitting in an aura of your own silence. I like to put it on after everyone has gone to bed and just reflect on my day. The film is lovely and tranquil and the music is such that you feel the silence is as important between the notes as the sound itself. Time stops here, and I bask in the silence only to be bathed in lovely sound as the music continues. The music is flute, windchimes,  birdsound, and flowing water making for a incredible combination for drifting off to sleep, healing arts, recovering from an illness or aiding in the experience of your own inner stillness. You have the option of music and nature or all
nature sounds by using the audio button on your DVD remote control. It is wonderful to take some time out in this hectic world and retreat to a quiet garden bringing back the warmth and sun of summer as I see the snow falling outside my window. I would like to thank the folks at zenchantment for making available this Zengarden DVD
adding much light and love on this beautiful planet Earth.",1299456000,33,1203,4.346666666666667
4115731,5,B003EV5BLK,"I purchased this DVD because I love going to Zen gardens and have visited quite a few throughout the years in both Japan and across the US. As soon as I put the DVD on I was in total heaven. For me it captures the beauty and charm of Japanese Zen gardens and tea gardens, and to be honest, I wasn't expecting it to be as good quality as it is. (I've bought a few others and they didn't do it for me quite as much.) This one has beautiful smooth camera work all the way through, gorgeous scenery, good music (sounds kind of Japanese but very relaxing) and I can switch it over to nature sounds when I want quiet background sounds instead. I thought this DVD was totally high quality and worthwhile.",1272067200,31,697,4.208955223880597

8395658,5,B003EV5BLK,"I really love this disc because it gives me the choice of having music, or just the natural sounds of the garden.  As I prefer nature sounds and nothing else, this was for me.  Earlier I had picked up a zen garden disc through Target and then realized that if I wanted to cut out the music on the disc, and chose the ""without music"" format on the disc, it took out ALL sounds, which of course included the nature sounds I bought the disc for.  So I was disappointed with that.
You won't be with this disc if you like nature sounds--- you have to choose to take the music out, but there are two settings that you can choose through your remote.  The price was a little more than I wanted to pay, but it was worth it to have a disc in the zen garden with nothing but nature sounds.",1406592000,2,779,4.071895424836601
8395659,3,B003EV5BLK,"Scenery beautiful but would like to see these types of DVD's with the nature sounds forward and the music distant. Japanese gardens are about nature and peace. If they could develop one that puts you INTO the scene to meditate, that would be nice.",1390348800,,247,4.636363636363637
8395660,2,B003EV5BLK,"With the limited scenery, the transitions were few and far between.  Seemed a little redundant; however, maybe that is what a zen garden is supposed to be for meditation purposes.",1382918400,,179,4.966666666666667

8395663,2,B003EV5BLK,The DVD did not meet my expectations.  The music/sounds were not pleasing to me for relaxation and meditation purposes.  I was expecting something more soothing.,1365984000,,161,5.4
8395664,3,B003EV5BLK,"This DVD is a one hour continuous looped film that plays continually.

The scenes are not that interesting or diversified.

Compared to the DVD named ""Japanese Gardens""...it is a bit of a boor.

Look for ""Japanese Gardens"" for a real thrill!",1365552000,,241,4.829268292682927
