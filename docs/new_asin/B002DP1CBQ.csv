If you grew up in the 50's & 60's, watching 16mm films in your school's classroom, this will bring back lots of memories. And some really rare stuff.  High definition? No. But it does look 100% like the 16mm films I remember so well. Highly recommended for collectors of rarities!",1254009600,,341,4.666666666666667
8365659,1,B002DP1CBQ,"Scarcely an hour of grainy black & white clips, many of which are available in color and far better condition.  Doesn't even fit together very well as a ""clip show"".  $14.99 is a cruel joke, as it has the same quality as a dvd I'd purchase at a ""dollar store"", were their anything worthy to purchase there.  No info included, looks like a home-burned dvd. Save your money.",1252800000,3,372,4.4411764705882355
