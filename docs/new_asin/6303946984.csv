Having seen Helen Slater in the 1984 movie Supergirl before the premiere of the series on CBS, I was interested in seeing this movie when I stumbled across it last week On Demand, and I saw it today. From Robby Benson, the star of Beauty And The Beast, comes a well-written suspense thriller of motherhood, love, betrayal, and murder. I shan't say too much, lest I spoil the surprises.

Helen Slater (Supergirl), Billy Zane (Back To The Future Parts I and II, Dead Calm), Kelly LeBrock, and Alan Thicke star in this thrill-a-minute joyride filled with several shocking twists. The only criticisms I have, for which I deducted one star, are: the gratuitous uses of religious profanity (ie. God's Name ta'en in vain, combining His Name with a mild profanity) and a too abrupt ending.",1504656000,,872,4.768211920529802

7856244,3,6303946984,"Ever since I saw SUPERGIRL in the theatre, I have always had a crush on Helen Slater.  Sadly, she has not done a whole lot of films since then.  Some 20 years later, I adore her every bit as much as I did way back in the 1980s!  Although she is from New York, she has this midwestern girl-next-door sweetheart quality about her that SO intoxicates me.

Now on to the movie.  The bad news is, it does not rank above ""OK.""  Although predictable, the plot was very contrived and beyond the realm of the believable.  The ending looked like it was edited with a chain saw.  Instead of coming to an end, the movie more-or-less just kind of ""stops.""

The good news is that Helen Slater stars in the film!  (Did I mention that yet, perchance?).  Also, the rest of the actors are pretty good too, including Kelly Lebrock.  The fact that Helen appears topless in the film becomes one of its biggest selling points.

This is not a great movie, by any stretch of the imagination.  It is basically a B movie that stars some actors who have been in A movies in the past.  For Helen Slater fans (like me!), however, the film is a must-have.  End of story.",1130025600,,1140,4.306603773584905
7856245,4,6303946984,"This is the movie that every Helen Slater fan will want to have in his DVD collection. The bad thing is that this DVD edition has no features at all, not even a chapter menu. I can't understand why someone would produce a DVD without the basic features of a DVD, as the scene selection. But the picture quality is very good and the colors sharp what not happen with the VHS edition. This movie has an unbelievable plot but is saved by the good performances of Helen Slater as the young mother Ellie West and Heather Lind as her daughter Autumn West. The seven year's old Autumn is so bright and cute that you will believe that she has just arrived from Argo City. She even has eyes with the same incredible color of her mother's. To have a so smart daughter is good for Ellie who is thrown inside a conspiracy where everybody wants to kill her, even her ex-husband, her best friend and her doctor. Here is where you will need to have a lot of what they call suspension of disbelief to enjoy this movie. A woman like Ellie would never have an ex-husband like that because she would never marry him in the first place. But even with a bad plot this is an enjoyable movie. And, of course, there is the famous sex scene where The Phantom makes love with Supergirl under the moonlight. Something you will never see in the comics.",1123891200,,1324,4.342741935483871
7856246,1,6303946984,"For any one who is a fan of Helen Slater, for ten bucks, this movie should be in their collection. One definitely gets lots of the Slater magic. Additionally, there are quite a few other ""second tier"" stars that make it fun.
However, be warned. The VHS tape is recorded at SLP (slowest speed), so the visual quality is awful. The story and direction are very poor as well, and the sound direction is horrendous. The switches between ADR, Foley, and live sound are jarring at times, and the overall audio mix is almost upsetting. But, I'm still glad to have it just for Helen.",1000684800,,575,4.485714285714286
7856247,2,6303946984,"I remeber watching this movie about 7 years ago, and I really didn't like it at all! I wanted to watch it first off because Helen Slater is one of my favorite actresses of all, and I thought she did a wonderful job with her performance! But the whole movie itself is too psychological and depressing that after seeing it 2 or 3 times, you really don't want to see it again! My compliments to Helen though for doing her best with this movie! She's as beautiful as she is talented!",984355200,,479,4.274725274725275
7856248,2,6303946984,"Betrayel of the Dove is a confusing, if not dizzying movie of a young divorced mother who is betrayed by her ex-husband,new lover, and best friend.  As the three of them plot to kill her, the story becomes more of a  montage of confusion and delirium rather than a fluid movie telling a  story. Filled with flashbacks and confusion, I certainly can not recommend  it-even to my worst enemy.",947808000,,390,4.608695652173913
