Very disappointed with it, but I am not going to bother sending it back and doing all those things because it is just not worth it, but i am not going to use your service in future",1306281600,,270,3.754385964912281
8143534,5,B000I2J66O,"My 3-year old son LOVES this DVD -- practicing the steps back and forth across my living room.  He enjoys the drumming and beat BIG TIME, so it makes something that would often be viewed as just for girls great for boys as well.  I enjoy watching him do it, and join him as well at times, so it's something fun we can do together.",1271030400,,330,4.061538461538461
8143535,1,B000I2J66O,"I didn't like this video workout - it wasn't consistent in keeping you moving, it was more instructional dance.  I didn't care for it, neither did my daughter, who I bought this video for as a Christmas present.",1232236800,2,211,4.552631578947368
8143536,5,B000I2J66O,"I'm very new to Bhangra, and I'm decades away from being a kid. I love this workout.  The steps are basic, which is great for a beginner.  You still get a good aerobic workout.  I find myself reaching for this one week after week.  It's just plain fun!",1220572800,2,252,4.1875
8143537,5,B000I2J66O,"I haven't done the other Masala Bhangra workouts, but I really enjoyed this one!  My son is only 3.5 and can't really do the video all the way, but he tries during the warm-up to follow along, and he didn't complain or make me turn off the video, which he's done with other workouts.  The baby, who is 2 months old, was fascinated enough to watch me do the whole thing, too.  I think an older child might enjoy doing this with a parent, and it's challenging enough for an adult.",1217548800,,478,4.230769230769231
8143538,5,B000I2J66O,"Unlike the other workouts for adults  this one starts from the beginning introducing steps one at a time and doing them over and over. But don't let the title fool you, it is great for  adults not just kids.  You have to be in shape to do the whole video.  The kids are very graceful: two boys and two girls of mixed ages and the music is a steady repetitive  beat that is perfect for the moves. The shoulder and arm moves are exhausing yet fun.  For women who are getting flabby arms this is a cure for flab! You can do just the upper body part if you want and do a walking step in place if you are not into jumping around. Its worth every penny  for the arm and shoulder moves alone.",1204934400,6,685,4.029629629629629
