7919478,4,B00003TL8C,"Captain Tom White in his debut series showing the foundation casts that led to greatness. Brilliantly clarifying direction lines are overlayed on the casting stroke to enhance understanding. The audio is good and the video set-up positions the observers' lens above and to the side of the Master Casting Instructor & future FFF Casting Board of Governor at work.  Captain White is among the best to present this material. This is the instructor's instructor and the focus of all eyes when he is throwing his loops. This set is becoming rare, collect these!",1163030400,,556,4.978494623655914

Tom White is one of the few people in the world that teaches  instructors!  There are many hints and secrets that enable me to better my  cast, and to be a more effective fly-caster.
