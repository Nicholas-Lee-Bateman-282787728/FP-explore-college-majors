8246716,5,B0012L2KBI,"Schubert's ""Great C Major"" symphony has been a favorite of mine for over forty years. This is a first-rate performance of it, with fine sound, enhanced by the excellent camera work that shows the appropriate musicians at key moments and shows Bernstein reveling in a work that he obviously loved. I would knock half a star off for the picture quality in Schumann's Manfred Overture, but the performance and sound are good.",1362873600,,422,4.875
8246717,4,B0012L2KBI,"Leonard Bernstein has never been famous for his Schubert and the performance here definitely shows why.  The first two movements have very little intensity and not much charm either.  The musicians of the Bavarian Radio Orchestra seem a little bored. Fortunately, things get better in the last two movements, especially the scherzo where Bernstein seems to really enjoy himself.  The finale is full of excitement and passion.

The Schumann, played by the magnificent Vienna Philharmonic, is simply in a class of its own.  It is highly passionate and dramatic and the VPO practically sets a new standard for the playing of Schumann.  I cannot understand why this performance was not part of the Schumann symphony DVD.  Some customers might not want the Schubert just to have this great overture performance.",1300233600,2,806,5.153846153846154
8246718,5,B0012L2KBI,"I have never been among those who fawn over everything Leonard Bernstein ever did. And I had some concerns, given the dates of recording (1987 for the Schubert, 1985 for the Schumann) that these performances might turn out to be among those mannered, sooo slow performances that Bernstein often led toward the end of his life. But I needn't have worried. Both performances are mainstream in general but with numerous evidences of Bernstein's own unique stamp (as, for instance, in the return of the oboe tune in the Andante second movement where he emphasizes the distant accompanimental proto-Mahleresque trumpet-and-drum fanfares). I have reviewed two other DVD performances of the Great C Major symphony -- those led by Gnter Wand and by Karl Bhm, the latter with the Vienna Philharmonic -- and this performance is at least the equal of those, and actually better than Wand's. The huge first movement is filled with drama and humor. The second movement is presented not with a 'wintry' introduction, as Tovey called it, but with an air of mystery that gives way to geniality. The oboe tune mentioned above is played not as 'heart-breaking' (Tovey again) but as a gentle quasi-oriental dance. (Kudos to the principal oboist of the Bavarian orchestra here.) The Scherzo is one of Schubert's best -- and, unusually, it is in the form of a fully worked-out sonata-allegro movement. Its boisterous good spirits counterbalance the drama of the huge first movement; its use of A-flat major echoes that movement, but its side-slip into A major takes us back to the Andante movement. Clever fellow, Schubert! The finale Allegro vivace is, of course, one of the glories of Schubert's entire oeuvre (although the frantically fiddling violins and violas -- they play the same triplet figure seemingly for hundreds of measures -- might disagree). This performance shows off the superior qualities of the BRSO's winds and brass to great effect. Bernstein's childlike joy in this music is apparent throughout, particularly so in this dancing finale. This is a wonderful performance, beautifully filmed and recorded in Munich's Musikvereinsaal.

I have never been terribly fond of Schumann's Overture to 'Manfred', feeling it rather too melodramatic. But, of course, Byron's poetic drama 'Manfred' is precisely that, so the music, written at the height of German romanticism, is, I suppose, appropriate to its purpose, in spite of any responses by modern sensibilities. If one recalls that Byron's protagonist is wracked with guilt over his incestuous longings for his own sister, the overture certainly mirrors his angst. This sort of emotionality is right down Bernstein's street and he leads a performance by the Vienna Philharmonic that is magnificent.
