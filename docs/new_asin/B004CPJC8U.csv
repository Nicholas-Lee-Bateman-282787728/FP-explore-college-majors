4327934,3,B004CPJC8U,This disk dies not appear to be in HD and it should have been done on Blue Ray. The performance of the cast is very good.,1299715200,,121,3.6923076923076925
4327935,5,B004CPJC8U,"You can tell from the first few bars of the overature that Rossini was in for a fast, fiery, frolic; a good night's entertainment. This was not to be taken as a serious opera offering as William Tell, Ermione or Tancredi. This was going to be a bustling, bubbly dancing and singing fest with spirits, devils and demons. This is no more apparent than in the several ballet sections. The music is infectious and giddy with no solemnity in sight. The paladins march around like toy soldiers while engaging in bel canto exercises. The opera was after all a celebration for the reopening of the San Carlo in Naples 1817 and a grand time was had by all. This recording captures the zest and spirit of that occasion. Ms Fleming is devine in her capturing the zeal and spirit (if not in top voice)and all the cast keep this fun ship sailing. Brownlee is a phenomenon. He glides through those twists and turns as no other tenor today. Banks and the other tenors did terrific work also. I enjoyed the ballet sequences, especially the excellent Aaron Loux. Unfortunately we cannot compare this production with previous ones as this is a long unperformed masterwork. I think the production by Mary Zimmerman is outstanding. I have not liked her other bel canto opera because I could compare them with the memory of other renderings. But in this case this is the first take on the unfamiliar opera. I say cheers! It is a joyous romp.",1298160000,8,1420,4.616600790513834
4327936,5,B004CPJC8U,"I have spent the last year hoping it would be released as a DVD.  The singing, especially the trio in the 2nd act, is incredible.  Just incredible.  Hope it gets to reach a wider audience and receive the acclaim it truly deserves.",1296691200,8,230,4.428571428571429
4327937,4,B004CPJC8U,"Rossini composed Armida in 1817 to celebrate the reopening of the Teatro San Carlo in Naples which had been destroyed by fire the previous year.  The opera was intended to be an impressive event that would feature all that the Neapolitan company had to offer.  The orchestration was to be brilliant, the singing spectacular, and even the ballet would be featured prominently.  Rossini certainly did not disappoint and produced an extravagant score... a score that must have seemed to be very avant guard at the time.  Incidentally, the San Carlo was blessed with an abundance of tenors, so the opera contains no less than six prominent tenor roles.  There is even a trio for three tenors in the final act that is a precursor to the ""three tenor craze"" of recent years.

That Neapolitan premiere had as it's focal point the San Carlo's prima donna the dramatic coloratura soprano extraordinaire and future Signora Rossini, Isabella Colbran in the title role.  The celebrated tenor Giovanni David was featured in the leading tenor role of Rinaldo. So how does the MET version measure up in comparison?

Actually Renee Fleming is quite good even though she tends to slur some of the coloratura... and I think that is a function of her trying to fuse jazz style improvisation with the Bel Canto tradition of embellishment. Also, I wish the voice had more heft and power as it seems just a half size too small for the part.  Perhaps I should have better tried to erase memories of Maria Callas who preformed the piece at the 1952 Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, but even Joyce DiDonato in extensive excerpts on her recent Rossini CD proves to be stiff competition as well. Still, Fleming does herself proud, and in a role that is one of the most difficult that Rossini ever penned... Plus her voice sounds as lush, creamy, and sensuous as ever and that is an advantage in the three love duets that grace the score.

However, the real star of the show is Lawrence Brownlee as Rinaldo. My God the man can sing, and sing he does, and with a clarion tenor that has a pleasing quick vibrato that adds a sense of excitement to his vocal production. In the many occasions where the other tenors have to echo passages previously sung by him it becomes all too obvious that the others are merely pretenders to the throne and why Brownlee was chosen for the lead.  Of the other tenors John Osborn is the standout... at times he can prove to be a bit inconsistent, but when he is on target as in this performance he is capable of being quite fine.  Maestro Frizza has an unimpeachable Rossinian pedigree and certainly knows his way around the eroticism, brilliance, and even the demonic aspects of the score

As for the staging, I continue to be relatively unimpressed with Mary Zimmerman's productions at the MET all of which have made it to DVD.  Personally I think she has not exactly proven to be an asset for the company with a Lucia di Lammermoor that was more a study in busy stage business than Donizetti's demented Scottish lass, and a downright ugly and ill-conceived La Sonnambula that seemed to be by Luigi Pirandello as opposed to Bellini.  In Armida what should have been magical... turns out to be somewhat bizarre at times.  Also, I do not like the fact that a good portion of the third act is played out in front of the show curtain in a very narrow and restricted area, and as such does not give an aura of being a professional production worthy of the MET. In addition, quite often she does not seem to trust the composer. For example, when Rossini writes a march, as in the opening scene, it is just that and solders are expected to march to the beat... not skip, bob, and weave thus making a mockery of and trivializing the basic musical ideas.  Still the fundamental concept for the first two acts is quite pleasing visually in a clean-cut and vibrant manner even if the costumes and sets to not exactly reflect the location and era of the librettist's and composer's conception.  Therefore the first and second acts... and especially the extended ballet... are the most successful portions of the staging and in spite of some fussy stage business that even somewhat impinges on Armida's big aria ""D'amore al dolce impero"". Also, Zimmerman has two mute figures representing love and revenge... the two conflicting aspects of Armida's character... popping up periodically throughout the production.  It is only in the final scene where the ideas that they represent are depicted in pre-Wagnerian leitmotif fashion by Rossini that this makes total sense.

Still, I am grateful that this production has been made available.  I doubt that it will be bettered in the near future... and Brownlee alone is more than worth the price of admission... plus Fleming does sing the title role as well as could be expected... plus there is no such thing as absolute perfection in this world.  Still! Would that we had the Callas Armida from 1952 on film... or at least available in better sound!  Actually in 1952 Callas was the as close to the perfect Armida as would be humanly possible, but unfortunately at that point in time there were absolutely no tenors who were capable of doing justice to Rossini's musical language.  Given the circumstances, even the venerable Tullio Serafin who conducted that performance was forced to abandon any attempt at even approximating a true Rossini style. Today we have the tenors, but alas no Callas... It just does not seem fair...",1296604800,41,5460,4.735232067510548
4327938,2,B004CPJC8U,"Rossini is not served well by this recording, which is a real shame, because Armida is a wonderful opera, and it really deserves to be better known. What is sad is that people will come to learn about Armida through this commercial release, and they will come away with less than a complete picture of Rossini's art. First, let's put aside the production, it is not really anything special, but it only detracts from the overall enjoyment of the opera marginally. Rossini operas can survive these kinds of fluffy colorful productions if the singing is good. Unfortunately the singing here ranges from good to bad to worse. None of the principles is entirely comfortable singing in the Rossini style. The American tenor Brownlee is probably the best of the bunch, but one only has to look back to Rockwell Blake who sang this role in the 1980's to see what a real Rossini tenor sounds like. If Brownlee had been partnered with a better soprano, one could probably look past his vocal shortcomings. But the American soprano Fleming is totally miscast in this opera. Earlier in her career she sang the role in Pesaro (1993) , filling in last minute for Anna Caterina Antonacci, and at the time she made a passable attempt at the role. But in 2010, Fleming sounds tired and her singing is approximate at best. She has no sense of the Rossini style and she ruins the music with sloppy phrasing and unintelligent musical ornaments. It's true Armida is a very difficult role, but that is no reason to settle for this kind of performance.

If someone is looking for a video performance of Armida there are some interesting choices, although none of them are currently available on Amazon.com. If you search for copies of the 1988 video with June Anderson and Rockwell Blake, or the 1988 video of the concert performance with Nelly Miricioiu and Bruce Ford you will better understand what beautiful music this is, when it is in the hands of capable singers.",1295136000,22,1948,4.729411764705882
4327939,4,B004CPJC8U,"I may be a bit bias in reviewing this new DVD of the Metropolitan Opera's new production of Rossini's charming ""ARMIDA"" as I have always been a huge fan of soprano Renee Fleming. Her charisma as a person and an artist are extremely attractive to me and her desire to push herself beyond what is expected of her as an artist is a quality to be admired. That being said when I saw her sing this role live it gave me chills listening to her. She beautifully fit into the role of the sorceress tempting Rinaldo away from his duties both physically and vocally. Although Rossini is not a specialty of her's, her unique timbre and the color of her voice provided some of the longer legato lines with a quality that both enchants and brings goosebumps. Her runs and faster sections were not always perfection and she seemed to struggle somewhat with Rossini's challenging ornamentation however there is no denying that the effort was a valiant one and not completely unsuccessful. If she was going to attempt any Rossini opera this one was a perfect fit and she sang with a confidence in herself that made any vocal flaws vanish. Lawrence Brownlee, a magnificent Rossini tenor, was wonderful and nearly stole the show from Fleming. His singing was almost flawless and he moved with ease through the complicated workings of the music, singing with passion and care.

Mary Zimmerman has often been criticized for her productions at the Met and I will not deny her mismanaged ""La Sonnambula"" was a mistake from the very conception. It was a boring, dull, and frankly confusing production that need never be revived at the Met again. Let's hope Peter Gelb locks it away and doesn't speak of it again. However her production of ""Lucia di Lammermoor"" I found inspired. I loved the fact she moved the period of the piece up a couple of years and to address what most people have a problem with, the sextet, I thought it was an interesting idea and fit the moment of stand & sing quite comfortably while not taking away from Donizetti's music. Now, her ""ARMIDA"", was a very safe looking production. Probably aware of her failure with ""Sonnambula"", she seemed to not want to take too many chances with this production and some could find her choices very plain and dull. However, since this was intended to be a showcase for Ms. Fleming, Zimmerman pulled it off quite nicely. It may not have been her best but it certainly was not her worst and I found the production to be interesting and entertaining but the singing was surely the highlight of the night.

It is important to remember that without Ms. Fleming's daring to take on a challenging role it may have been years until Rossini's ""ARMIDA"" finally arrived at the Met. This is a brilliant opera with some of Rossini's most beautiful music. The finale of the final act is one of the most stirring pieces of music, in my opinion, he has ever written and some of the duets between Mr. Brownlee and Ms. Fleming were incredibly moving. I recommend this production of this Rossini masterpiece. I think that it is a wonderful pairing of singer with role and Fleming's rendition of ""ARMIDA"" is definitely something to see.",1295049600,34,3156,4.66427289048474
4327940,5,B004CPJC8U,"If you loved the Broadway musical WICKED, you will love this DVD version of the Met production of Armida. It is amazing how the staging and costuming are so similiar. Wicked had a stellar cast and so does Armida. This is the first recording of Armida where all six tenor roles were played by six different tenors and not doubled. This leads me to a sad commentary about the recording industry. Here we have such new, ambitious productions of such opera rarities as Armida, and all we have to preserve them are live recordings as opposed to studio recordings that filter out the coughing, sneezing and applause.",1295049600,10,610,4.710280373831775
4327941,4,B004CPJC8U,"With all due respect to the previous reviewer, I do not find this Mary Zimmerman production as bad as he found it.  While nothing in this production would make me think of the Crusades, at least it was colorful and looked glitzy.  It makes little difference anyway because it is highly unlikely that we will ever see this opera staged again (notwithstanding the repeat performances taking place at the Met next month).  ""Armida"" is not one of Rossini's stronger operas.  I'll go even further and say that it's not an important opera at all.  The plot is too insane and inane to waste words on, and the piece is quite lengthy.  So what does it have to offer?

  If one is captivated by virtuoso bel singing, and if one is tenor-crazy, then this is definitely a piece of exotica that you should investigate.  All the tenors are excellent, most notably Lawrence Brownlee and John Osborn.  There are tenor arias, duets, and all are embellished with florid cadenzas and rousing conclusions.  In fact, I had a problem distinguishing which tenor was singing which character.  But this matters very little because the effect is that of an elaborate vocal concert in costume.  I found the ballet mildly interesting, though somewhat longer than I expected.  One wonders if Rossini inserted it to give the singers a rest.

  Renee Fleming is to be commended and lauded for taking on this fiendishly difficult florid role.  Maria Callas caused a sensation with this opera in Florence in 1952, and along with her revelatory performances of Norma, Gioconda, Lady Macbeth and Lucia di Lammermoor, firmly established herself as the reigning prima donna of the world.  Well, Renee Fleming is no Maria Callas, but then again, who is?  Fleming has a great voice, and she has the florid technique to command the bravura passages of the role.  Her huge aria in Act II (""D'amore al dolce impero"")  is a doozy of a showpiece and Fleming gives it everything she's got.  Whether or not she's at her absolute vocal best is not important -- for there's not another soprano anywhere today who would attempt this music --- and for good reason.  Armida's music is full of mine fields and Fleming doesn't fall into a single one of them --- an amazing feat in itself!

  I would not dismiss this opera.  If you are the type of listener who is excited by virtuoso operatic singing, colorful sets, and sheer fantasy, you will probably enjoy this performance.  If you're a fan of Renee Fleming, you should definitely own this performance.  It displays her in what is probably one of most difficult operas any soprano could ever even consider singing.  With operas like ""Armida"" and ""Pirata"" already in her repertoire, one wonders whether she'll ever take on Bellini's Norma.",1294790400,36,2739,4.7987152034261245
4327942,2,B004CPJC8U,"First, a ""Lucia"" that ignored the tyrannical big brother, forced marriage for financial gain, forbidden love plot, for a ghost story, B-movie approach, and used the fabulous sextet as merely background music for a photographer, posing his picture.  Then, an incoherent ""Sonnambula"" set in a rehearsal hall, with no reference to the actual setting, until the chorus showed up in Swiss costumes for the finale.  And now, Rossini meets ""Cats""--oh, these were supposed to be demons?  I hope Peter Gelb is familiar enough with baseball to know that three strikes is out!
Musically, I will not fault this performance.  Fleming is Fleming, even though not at her best here.  And, what tenor fanatic would not delight in five tenor roles, including Lawrence Brownlee, one of the finest new tenors to come along. Riccardo Frizza leads the Met orchestra through their paces admirably.
What, then, is wrong?  According to the synopsis, ""Armida"" takes place during the Crusades.  Does Mary Zimmerman have any idea what the Crusades were?  (For that matter, did she bother to consider the story of any of the three works she directed?)  Crusaders in ankle-length coats?  The women's chorus, whoever thay were supposed to be, dressed like a group of twentieth century Middle Eastern housewives? Then, we have a red-dressed cherub who enters the scene at appropriate (?) moments, sometimes dropping in from above,
Visually, the best part of the production was the Act 2 ballet, which some professional critis considered superfluous.  But even that, which is described as nymphs seducing a warrior, was more like ""How many styles of dancing can we show in twenty minutes?"" along with tutu-clad cats--uh, demons--coming into the scene to parody what had already been danced.
I anticipated a rousing finale, when Armida destroys the pleasure palace; but instead, we simply see her being carried into hell by a flock of cats--uh, demons.",1294790400,41,1918,5.135048231511254
4327943,4,B004CPJC8U,"The real issue in this opera is the struggle between love and revenge. The love part is easy to understand. The revenge is a combination of hate, jealousy and honor. The struggle of these two is embodied in two non-signing actors/dancers that appear at certain times in all three acts.  It is very effective and helps center the story in this real human struggle. The external plot is supposed to happen during the crusades battles to conquer Jerusalem. Zimmerman's production minimizes this aspect to the point that if you don't know it a priori it will be difficult for you to put the plot in space and time. To confuse you more, some of the uniforms are very similar to a Tannhauser production I saw. The set of the first act looks more like those immaculate Florida developments where everything is perfectly placed and colors abound. After you realize that what is important is the initial scam by Armida that transforms itself into real love, this time without magic potions, the colorful and out of place surroundings don't matter anymore.
Armida is a very difficult opera to sing. Fleming does an incredible job at it. Kudos to her for taking this role and for a wonderful performance. Brownlee is just magnificent. What a perfect voice for this role!
The ballet in second act is beautiful, uplifting and, at some points, comical. A real pleasure to watch.
This Opera is a masterpiece by Rossini, somehow different than the others as it is more on the serious an introspective side of their protagonists. In spite or despite whatever the stage production is, if it is well singed, it is a great opera worth listening and watching.",1326153600,3,1638,4.767605633802817
4327944,2,B004CPJC8U,"Lots and lots of beautiful music, as other reviewers describe in detail. Some also describe Mary Zimmerman's poor staging, but I was so disgusted I had to issue a warning:
Amateur Night at the Met.
Costumes and sets are crude, clumsy, cheap looking, and ugly, ugly, ugly. Staging is awkward, arch and trying to be clever when it is simply stupid.
Opera fans are used to poor productions, but this one is an especially pretentious disgrace.
If I've exaggerated, maybe some readers can find it better than expected.",1321142400,3,513,4.840909090909091
4327945,5,B004CPJC8U,"I am not a Rossini expert, but I enjoy opera and I enjoyed this performance.  Renee Fleming did not just stand and sing, but fully engaged in the character.  Her character's joys and anguish are clear.  Her performance was very athletic.  The staging was fun and the video was nicely directed -- The colors were clear, there was little distraction by inappropriate pans or shots of the orchestrata during dramatic stage scenes.  Issuing this in Blu Ray to get the better sound would have been nice.  I still don't understand why the MET records these in high definition and then issues standard DVDs.  I wish I could have seen this opera live.",1317513600,,643,4.6875

I saw this production when it was shown in the movie theater during the HD metropolitan series and since that moment I want to buy the DVD.
I don't have a copy of another production of this opera and I haven't seen another version either, so that I don't have another reference about Armida, but that doesn't that I can't have an opinion about this performance.
I found all the cast very good.
It was not a surprise the way Renne Fleming sang in the main role of Armida,her transformation as a lover to a vengeful woman who uses her faculties as a sorceress to archive her purposes.
Her opposite, Lawrence Bownlee is excellent showing the ambivalence between the love that he feels for Armida and his duties toward his country.
I also found John Osborn and Barri banks very good.
I enjoyed the ballet very much; the choreography especially, the dancing was great.
Some reviewers criticized the setting and the costumes designers,(like I said before I don't have another version of this opera to compare),but I liked the scenery, the costumes, the lights and I was able to follow the story because the success of all this elements, for instance the enchanted island that looks like a bucolic scene ,the tempest that Armida produced to destruct everyone ,the opposition between love and hate that is shown through out the story with characters that represent all this emotions.
In my opinion this is a very good production that can be enjoyed from beginning to end.",1316908800,4,1677,5.332075471698113
4327947,5,B004CPJC8U,"Me and my family are relatively new to opera. I purchased this DVD because of the pink dress on the cover -- I thought my girls would like it. Well, that and I've never heard Renee Fleming.

Honestly, I'd be tempted to give this 4 stars. The staging was nothing special. And some parts were a little flagging. However, the two main characters carry the show easily. It takes a while for Rinaldo (Lawrence Brownlee) to appear. But when he does, he takes over immediately. He is absolutely amazing. I cannot figure out why I haven't heard of him before.

Armida (Renee Fleming) appears before Rinaldo, but it takes Renee a while to warm up to the role. And interestly, you can even see this in the in-between interviews on the disc. In the first interview, she's a little aloof. But in the second interview, she's all there. By the time Act III rolls around, she has a full head of steam and is really into it. Wow!

The music of this opera is really quite nice, too. Much of it is quite pleasant.

On the whole, the performance was excellent. And Lawrence Brownlee gets a standing ovation.",1313539200,2,1088,4.47979797979798
4327948,3,B004CPJC8U,Renee Fleming does a credible job in a difficult role as Armida. Lawrence Brownlee has a voice for the ages. Keith Miller is a standout!,1311465600,,136,4.48
4327949,4,B004CPJC8U,"It is very obvious why Renee Fleming revived this relatively obscure Rossini opera.  It is a tour de force for the leading lady and Ms Fleming gives a bravura performance in the starring role.  She is ably supported by the rest of the cast, especially Lawrence Brownlee as Rinaldo.  While Armida is not a great opera, it is a very enjoyable.  The Metropolitan Opera's whimsical minimalist staging of the opera emphasized the fantastical elements of the proceedings making it all the more entertaining.  I especially liked the ending when Rinaldo is leaving the island and Armida is literally being pulled between a cherubic ""Love"" and a monstrous ""Vengeance.""  All in all, this is great fun and I highly recommend it.",1304726400,3,717,4.933333333333334
4327950,5,B004CPJC8U,"I would encourage anyone who has an interest, even if slight, to take the plunge and get this DVD for a number of reasons. This HD performance presents a fantastical opera plot with a sense of true whimsy and a Janus-like look forward as well as back, creating a unique look with wonderful resonances. The musical side imparts a balanced and fulfilling vision of this somewhat maligned work, which proves to be unjustified. As others have so well documented, it was created for a special occasion, with very specific needs, creating difficulties for casting. Since the outcome is beautifully balanced as a production both romantic and exciting with thrilling vocal moments aplenty. I would recommend it to everyone! I have seen it a number of times and have played it for others with such a positive reaction, that I catch their enthusiasm and feel excited about it all over again!

I was incredibly fortunate to be present at several performances of ARMIDA in the house, as well as having caught the HD when originally broadcast, and then going to the Encore with other friends two weeks later. The direction of the video brings us inside the action, making superb points so nothing is missed dramatically. The sound is good, though digital media certain aspects of voices, not the same experience as hearing these glorious talents right in front of us. They are nicely imaged almost all the time. The quibble I might have about sound concerns the dynamic staging, with characters freely moving throughout the space, particularly front to back. Some slight moments vary slightly in sound quality. This is probably to be expected due to the origin a a live event.

Some have felt the music to be less than first. In the early 90's, I actually attended another performance, and it resulted in feeling frustrated with the work, not wanting to experience it again for any reason. As time moved on, I kept coming across this work again, and sampling the artistic visions of others , realizing that here was an attractive work, something I just didn't know that well, but now liked. I spent time listening to ARMIDA carefully before coming to this production. After the first Sirius broadcast that I experienced of opening night, I realized what was here, the depth and dimension of it.

I LOVED IT!

This production and cast presented ARMIDA in immediate and specific ways, so for the first time I could appreciate, understand and come to LOVE this opera. Everyone has moments of brilliance in interpretation and performance, regardless of the length or focus of their role. I keep returning to this cast from other versions I have collected, and find this production hits so many bases and with intelligence, humor and intensity, that I do not anticipate any others in the future or from the past rivaling this HD broadcast as a whole. Several commentators on this site have thought less of the music, and I believe this is a disservice to the brilliance of Rossini. Getting to understand and truly appreciate this opera for what it is, reveals a breadth of interpretation on the part of Rossini, bathing the story in a very specific sound world, though recognizable as his own composition. It 'feels' unlike any other opus in his output, especially considering his detailed and sensuous orchestration complete with extended instrumental passages in the duets. It is virtuosity spread over every part of the score.

Riccardo Frizza sets the performance pace with a vigorous articulation of the overture that respects the classical base of this romantically forward looking score. ARMIDA could be played for a very romantic urgency, yet Frizza never lets the style disappear in the urgency of the drama, through a lightness and fleetness of sound, allowing for a flexible control. He is supporting the artists in their dramatic moment, yet not going to bombast. A Rossini sound at all times. I like this forward momentum, which is not common in performances of this repertoire, unless the conductor is duly aware.

The tone of the piece was furthered with brashness and electrifying top notes by John Osborne from the outset as Geoffredo, leader of the Christian Armies, manipulated by the enchantress ARMIDA for her own purposes. The first scene continues with the sincerity and earnestness of Yegishe Manucharayan as Eustazio, a recitative-bound character who contributes mostly in the ensemble sections of the first act. He succeeded in creating a specificity of character who effectively advances the plot, no small feat in this musical context. Both of these artists are tenors, two of the six tenor roles of the opera. They point out how different each personage is in this story, with music that effectively characterizes each with no feeling of aural fatigue due to their sharing the same vocal registers.

The next tenor of the moment, Barry Banks as Gernando,is the nemesis to our hero. Mr. Banks essays two roles in this production effectively characterizing each. Gernando is only in the first act, and has a solo scena to himself of impressive depth with it's reflective middle section with flute obligato. The silent figure of Revenge, is performed by the tatooed Isaac Scranton, who literally infects and drags Gernando to his doom at one point. Banks' work definitely benefits from the close range of the camera, and a 'bravo!' to him for not being distracted vocally when singing a high note to end the aria while being pawed and dragged offstage the character of Revenge. The vocalism was bright and assertive with a wonderful flexibility to the big tone making his character quite viable - poisonous insinuations with an overall sneer just begging to be overheard.

In the lower voices, Peter Volpe as Idraote, Armida's co-conspiritor. sang what little was given to him with assurance and cut as much a figure as the few lines would allow him in the story. Some of his pronouncements and subsequent actions still mystify me dramatically. But I give that to be an opera of it's time, not always logical, just making an excuse for an exit if necessary so a duet can take place. The devil Astarotte was convincingly portrayed with deep sonorities and a superb physical grace by Keith Miller in another memorable character. His athleticism while not stinting on the vocalism needed for maximum impact made this moment look easy when it demanded a long period of training to master the moment, as he detailed in his backstage interview with Debra Voigt during the 2nd intermission. The balances and physical carries over the other chorus members was the invention of choreographer Graciela Daniele of Broadway fame, who brought a strong urgency to the devil's scene opening Act Two. This is where the DVD triumphs in revealing detail - more impressive than watching this scene and the subsequent ballet in the house. The camera lens, giving a framework to the dancing enhanced its dramatic impact more than viewing in the house, though the upstairs vantage point showed everything in it's place, and the view from the main floor revealed a messy throng of bodies with little focus.

I have followed the career of Ms. Fleming for many years, and truly appreciate how hard she has worked to create a more glowing, rounded and even tone since the first time she essayed the role of ARMIDA, in the 90's. The ornaments that were created with the help of Phillip Gossett, the noted Rossini scholar, reflect the nature of her instrument and I find quite fulfilling. I strongly assert a belief that this role is split in it's musical language, analogous to the the role of Violetta in LA TRAVIATA. The roulades and runs of Act One and Two are significantly different than the dramatic coloratura and expressiveness of the last act. I wondered if this was a conscious decision to deepen the musical context for a previously cardboard figure. Her dilemma becomes very desperate, as with startling realism, the repeated marcato notes of her pulse surge quietly forward after her fainting, only punctuated by chords representing a return to consciousness leading finally to outright fury. This is an amazing inner journey showing great ingenuity and understanding on the part of the composer. This is not second rate music.

Ms. Fleming gives her sorceress a graciousness and calmness inspired by her infatuation for Rinaldo, while cascading torrents of notes for the whole evening : a singular tour-de-force which is very satisfying. Especially listening to the final scene with it's alternating fear, pleading, fainting, then reminiscing before a final outburst reveals her dead-on sense of dramatic risk both vocally and physically. This performance represents her Art at a very considerable best.

Joining her is Lawrence Brownlee as the knight Rinaldo, the hero of the Christian Armies. He provides a visceral excitement from his very first entrance on the shoulders of an adoring populace. The thrill of his radiant and focused tone created a character torn between love and duty from the outset. Through an expressive use of shading the vocal line, coloratura roulades and high notes tossed off with superb accuracy and abandon, this character came totally to life. These qualities in wonderful balance puts Mr. Brownlee squarely in the forefront of Rossini interpreters without reservation. In fact, his performance is brilliant. Pearly runs, huge control of breath and dynamics with vocal shadings evoking the most sensitive and also heroic emotions make this performance one of a lifetime. A number of fine singers in the past have done very well with this role and gave superb performances. This is the reading and performance to which I gladly return as a benchmark for superb execution and dramatic involvement. He simply hits every base possible and hits it out of the park!

The combination of Ms. Fleming and Mr. Brownlee in the three principal duets are beyond words. So melting, flowing and finely detailed. The memory of this singing comes into mind at points when I am not even watching the DVD, they stay in memory. Each amplifies the other's tonal beauty to create something very special. A palpable connection exists between these two artists in their dramatic interactions which go beyond each artist individually. These duets feature instrumental solos by concert master David Chan and cello soloist Rafael Figueroa whose interplay with the vocal lines amazes. Another reason for the duets to be memorably magnificent.

A final glory about this production is the famed trio for three tenors in the last act. Joining Brownlee are tenors Barry Banks (in his second role of the evening as Carlo) and the estimable Kobe van Rensburg as Ubaldo, ( who has contributed a great interpretation of IDOMENEO in the past seasons at the MET). Their blend of voices, dramatic assertiveness and thrilling sound capped by High D's from Mr. Brownlee, are the most exciting I have heard from any trio of tenors from the past. Surging forward with great gusto in the pit, Riccardo Frizza matches the intensity of their conflict with a push forward that catapults this moment to the edge. And the audience responded with great entusiasm too, which is thrilling to witness.

This production, so very well thought out and motivated from moment to moment by director Mary Zimmerman is a great pleasure. This DVD has already brought new people to this opera and to the MET itself, based in my experience when viewing ARMIDA at the house this year. A couple sitting next to me had never been to an opera before, yet were there for the first time having seen a part of this DVD of ARMIDA on PBS during the summer. The explained before the last act, that even though the performance was amazing, they felt too embarrassed to yell 'BRAVO' as they were quiet people and it was not their style. Then the third act trio was sung to glorious effect and the house went MAD and I looked over to this couple as all were cheering and shouting 'BRAVO!' around me, and they were too!",1304121600,6,11968,4.953685258964144
4327951,5,B004CPJC8U,"This is Rossini's masterpiece. Full of the most incredible melodies and the most beautiful music. The reason it is not being sung often is because it is one of the 9 defining Assoluta roles requiring from the soprano a fully supported 3 octave voice (not just hitting here and there a low chest tone or a high note but fully supported vocal line from low G3 to  high Eb6). Fleming is the only living soprano who can actual support a vocal line that spans three octaves with such quality of singing. She could very much be hailed as the Queen of the Vocal Line. The other reason why this opera is not sung often is because Maria Callas' 1952 live performance exists in complete, and those who have heard it know very well that in that night Callas revealed a kind of Inhuman singing that could never be repeated no matter how hard any soprano would try. Nevertheless, Fleming manages to sing this opera her own way, without comromising either the low register or the top notes (although avoiding the nightmarish Eb6s, E6s and F6 that Callas sang that night).

Many singers tried to sing Rossini's Armida after Callas - all to disastrous failure either lacking the low register, or the top register or the coloratura. Fleming seems to have it all while maintaining a Beauty of Line unique in this kind of repertoire.
Above all this opera is tremendously beautiful from a musical point of view and Rossini's greatest effort to write Opera Seria for the Soprano Sfogato Assoluta (this is the only Rossinian Opera that enters the high Circle of the 9 defining Assoluta roles).",1301616000,4,1571,4.667870036101083
4327952,4,B004CPJC8U,"I am not a great fan of Rossini, but I love Renee Fleming.  I heard the Met broadcast of this opera and loved it.  The music actually changed my opinion of Rossini.  I bought the DVD out of curiosity to see the production.  I found some of the choreography, costumes and sets actually distracting - a little too much Broadway glitz. In spite of that, it tells a wonderful story and Fleming and Brownlee are superb.  I highly recommend it.",1299974400,4,438,4.425
8423358,3,B004CPJC8U,"I have mixed feelings about this Armida production. The staging itself is sometimes oddly camp looking and feels a bit surrealist which seems at odds with the music. Renee Fleming looks gorgeous (especially in the bright pink gown shown on the cover) as the sorceress Armida but sounds less than comfortable in this bel canto role. She seems to navigate some of the florid ornamental passages especially early in the opera gingerly. She sounds as if she is holding back. Ms. Fleming herself has said that she is no bel canto specialist and so she is careful to husband her vocal resources, a wise choice for a non-specialist singer in this repertoire, and Ms. Fleming is astute at taking care of her voice. It is at the end she lets go in the dramatic final scenes and is convincing there. Lawrence Brownlee is amazing as Rinaldo, the man Armida seduces. As a reigning bel canto singer, he navigates his passages with ease. The thing that is hardest to swallow in this production, for me, is the odd staging.  An okay production overall but not a favorite for me.",1433980800,,1063,4.654255319148936

8423360,5,B004CPJC8U,"Renee Fleming is a contemporary operatic singing treasure! This Metropolitan Opera production was mounted especially for her and for her prodigious talents. Armida has been seldom performed since it's original composition by Rossini and first performance for the Naples Teatro San Carlo in 1817. Indeed, it's performance history is so sparse that Production Designer Mary Zimmerman had virtually no previous performances from which to gather production ideas. The requirement to cast six tenors has always been an issue though in some previous productions as well as in this one, multiple roles are performed by one of the six. Here Barry Banks performs Gernando in the First Act and then Carlo in Act Three. Lawrence Brownlee has Bel Canto abilities that are matched well with those of Fleming. Their multiple duets are thrilling, they compliment each other effectively and no competition is evident. Other than Brownlee the four lesser tenors are not particularly familiar names, but, their performing talents do not disappoint. John Osborn as Goffredo is especially impressive. Banks is exciting. The primary cast also requires two basses and those two roles are very well done. I suppose that I may be too much of a traditionalist with regard to staging and costuming, with the Mary Zimmerman production not being particularly pleasing to me. However the Riccardo Frizza orchestral conducting performance and the singing of Fleming, Brownlee, and the other tenors and basses are all so superior that the other factors of the production hardly matter. The male choral pieces are energetic and beautifully sung. Lovers of Rossini's music may just be overwhelmed!",1431734400,,1664,5.330798479087452

8423363,5,B004CPJC8U,This is the first of the Met In HD series that I ever saw. I saw it as an encore in the theater and also on DVD at home.  It is stunning in both sound and visually.  It is a captivating story that supports not only one of the greatest saprano roles ever written but also two elegant ballets.  Renee Fleming looks delicious and captivating and sounds even better.  The sound quality is superb and it was a great night to record.  The Met in general does the best camera work I have seen in opera to DVD.  This is a winner in every way.  I have seen over 30 operas in my life and this one may be the best.,1390867200,,603,3.9338842975206614
8423364,5,B004CPJC8U,"It is hard to envision Renee Flemimg as a Demon, but she sings and acts out the dual face she obsessively must live in to perfection. The perfromances here are of such a high standard that it breathtaking, hard to critique.

The trills, the high notes, the extended low notas of Renee radiate throughout the performance with unbelievable vibrations, that allows the rest of this startling cast to act and sing at the same level of excellece as Renee Fleming.

What a libretto, and how long Renee must sing troughout the opera with no signs of weariness..she embodies the chraracter so much, she could go on and on and on.

The costumes and sets are right; hell with a spider on the wall, flat surfaces the color of dirt, and then Renee's costumes..reds and blacks, and bright yellows contrast sharply with the sets, especially when she sings of love and finally despair. Her perfomance determines how we look at these sets, at any other character in the opera in fact.

The conducting is lavish in detail, always with Renee and L. Brownle, a stand out renor in every way here. The music caresses the singners so that dance melodies becime unforgettable, as does thie entire opera.

Buy this DVD and do not miss this epiphanic performance by Renee Fleming and her co-stars.

No, she can not be Maria Callas, but she can  be R. Fleming, passionate abolut art, humble before Callas, and this voice rewards the listener with one marvelous scene after another.",1389571200,,1455,4.7272727272727275
8423365,5,B004CPJC8U,"I'll begin by saying that I do not consider this work to be one of Rossini's greatest operas.  The music is beautiful, but the story seems to be miscellaneous scenes strung together.  Each scene is fine, but the whole is less than the sum of the parts.  Also, to me the opera does not end; instead it just stops and everyone goes their separate ways.

One now might ask why I rated this DVD as 5-stars.  I did so because the performances, singing and acting, as well as the staging are excellent, and they do draw one into the story.  As evidence I will point out that I first saw this production as a Met Encore performance in a local movie theater.  The theater audience often burst into applause after arias and scenes, and at the conclusion many audience members gave the digital performance a standing ovation.  I have never before seen that at a Met Encore performance.",1388534400,,875,4.493670886075949
8423366,3,B004CPJC8U,"Rossini's Armida is based on a Renaissance fantasy about the First Crusade.  Rossini's librettist clearly cared a great deal about the underlying theme of honor versus love.  He also gives us a brief meditation on the difference between glory, honor, and duty in Genarro's soliloquy.
  Armida contains some of Rossini's finest music.  It is beautifully performed on this DVD.  Renee Fleming treats the title role in early romantic rather than late bel canto style.  The effect is stunning.  She conveys Armida's deviosity with restrained tentative singing in the first act.  In the second and third acts, she throws the full weight and range of her magnificent voice into the role as Armida reveals her true character.  Lawrence Brownlee partners her perfectly.  His quick mid-line high notes are dazzling.  John Osborn is a great Godfrey de Bouillon. From the top of the tenor range to the bottom, his voice rings with authority.  Barry Barks does a fine tour-de-force as the villainous Gennaro.  The other tenors handle their roles well, too.
  Why only 3 stars?  The production is terrible!  Moving the time of an opera usually creates conflict between the lines and the action.  Moving the time in two directions at once is so jarring that even this great cast cannot fully engage the emotions of the viewer.  The chorus are costumed in surcoats and armor suggestive of the 8th century rather than the Crusades.  The commanders are dressed in the uniforms of WWI Aurtrian generals!  I found myself calling Brownlee's character ""Colonel General von Rinaldo.""  The height of ridiculous is reached in act 3 where Carlo enters in 20th century Austrian uniform carrying a 17th century Italian rapier and a 6th century Celtic shield.  Even fantasy has a time and place.
  The sets are barely adequate; no sets at all would have served as well.",1348358400,4,1841,4.973684210526316
