The movie begins by showing a pasture with horses, sheep, and cows. A man rides a bucking horse. Men bet on either the horse or the rider. Tom Duncan wins, he's saving to buy a ranch and get married. John Duncan has a new will. There is a secret hiding place in a closet. [Not well thought out?] Tap Smiley wants to consolidate with the Duncan ranch. But there is a quarrel between them. Cowboys have fun in a saloon. Mail arrives. Some men pick a fight with Tom. Tom wins. ""You're next."" Rusty eats some of John's food and lies down. A masked man shoots John! A man shoots at Tom. Later Tom wonders about the cook. Then Windy is gone. That masked man shoots Scarface! Men capture Tom. Nancy goes to visit Tom and gets a surprise.

Tom's horse unties his hands, he knocks out his captor and escapes. Back home he telephones the sheriff. Tom finds the concealed room in the cellar. After he finds the hidden money he is hit from behind. The masked man steals the cash. ""Which way did they go?"" The chases take up a lot of time. There is a fight on the wagon and they both fall off. Tom wins, and we learn the identity of that masked man. There will be a happy ending for Nancy and Tom.

This is like some ""haunted house"" mystery where there are secret rooms and passage ways. It is a story where a man's inheritance is at risk. Aside from the setting it could have taken place in a city. The story is poor, and it is definitely low budget. You won't want to watch it more than once.",1288137600,,1513,4.1924398625429555

There are so many continuity errors in the making of this film that it had become a standard in film school as how not to make a film.  It is generally ranked as the all time worse made film.

The lack of film making skills has made this a cult and fan favorite.  It is so badly made that it actually becomes funny and it would make a great subject for a film school report.",1228262400,,442,4.104651162790698
