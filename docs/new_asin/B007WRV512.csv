8522705,5,B007WRV512,I'm happy with my purchase. The music is good and there is a lot of it. I've wanted it for some time and I'm happy to have finally bought it.,1474675200,,141,3.7333333333333334
8522706,5,B007WRV512,"Very nice! 4 CDs and 2 concerts plus special behind the scene video in one low price! There are almost no song overlap on the 2 concerts by the way, so you get lots of songs. It is also special that the 2nd concert has brass and string sections in the band, which is unique among all other Miku concerts. Also the converts invited some original producers such as Samfree, Oster project, etc. to perform solo on the stage along with Miku and the band. Highly recommended!",1462233600,,470,4.413793103448276
