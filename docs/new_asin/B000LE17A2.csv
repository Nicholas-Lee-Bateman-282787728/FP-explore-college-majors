2707405,3,B000LE17A2,"WARNING: SPOILERS THROUGHOUT! The Legion of Doom!!! How cool is that? Well,,,it could have been better. Don't get me wrong, from the first scenes of ""I am Legion"" I was hooked, but it kind of went all over the place from there.

Cool points: The villains. This season is pretty much all about the bad guys. We see quite a bit of character development within the Legion itself, most notably Lex, Tala, Dr. Polaris (who has an interesting dynamic playing against Lex), Devil Ray (who is just really cool), & Sonar (see: ""Grudge Match"", he has some of the funniest lines of the whole season). The Legion is totally shaky when it comes to alliances: Lex vs. Grodd then Polaris, Tala playing both sides of the field, and it all boils down to an old guard vs. new guard battle royal towards the end of the season (special note: awesome fight between Lex and Grodd & Toyman and Killer Frost in ""Alive!""). Lex especially shines this season, having gone pretty much mad since the events of last season and hearing the voice of Brainiac all the time, which I thought was an interesting way of making Brainiac part of the Legion like he was back in the Superfriends days and still maintain the integrity of Timms/Dini DC animated vision. Best episodes include: ""The Great Brain Robbery"" (just a cool episode), ""Grudge Match"" (note: Nightwing makes a cameo appearance which I missed until recently. If you look at the building top when Huntress and Black Canary enter Bludhaven, the shot is from the top of a building, there are two gargoyles and what I mistook for a third is actually the silhouette of Nightwing,,,very cool, plus who doesn't like a good girl on girl fight even if it is animated!), and ""Dead Reckoning"" (where Batman takes a life).

Bad Points: 1) J'onn J'onz. What the #$%&, man! One of the coolest characters on the show, and he's gone for the whole thing (he appears in TWO episodes). No real explanation, at least not a convincing one. Sure, he needed to go ""find himself"", but the writers could have done a lot more with it instead of him ""coming in to save the day"" at the end. I guess that's what heroes do, but I would like to have seen at least something more of what he was doing while away.  2) Hawkman. Bad idea! Sure he was in the comic League (or Society, actually) but did he really need to be brought in here, and like J'onn, for only two episodes of any worth? 3) The writing. Not up to par. Too much was thrown into this season: J'onn leaving, Supergirl leaving, GL/Hawkgirl/Vixen triangle (still not very well resolved), Hawkman, the Legion of Doom & Legion of Superheroes, Darkseid's return, Cadmus aftermath, the Seven Soldiers of Victory, and the newly began and quickly forgotten Flash/Fire attraction, and for that matter, did we REALLY need to bring back the Blackhawks from the ""Savage Time""? I can understand trying to tie-up all the loose ends from the previous 4 seasons, but if you are going to do that, not really a good idea to introduce a whole lot more story twists to the mix. The writers seemed to making up for the absence of any decent Flash stories in season 3 as well (where three of the stories feature him predominantly, and yet the Martian Manhunter gets two??). Worst episodes: ""I am Legion"" (simply for story flow issues, otherwise cool), ""Shadow of the Hawk"" (unresolved stuff there) and ""To Another Shore"" (last real J'onn episode...okay, I'm a bit bitter over it!)

I've torn this season up enough. It's still really cool. The animation is top shelf,  the Metrotower is a cool addition. Mr. Terrific gets a huge part in this season, and as always Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman make the show excellent. Plus, Superman letting all hell break loose on Darkseid in the final episode was AWESOME!

All in all, not the best way to end a great show like Justice League. Another season following this one would have been better just to pace things out a bit more. But, alas, all good things must end.",1167091200,7,3952,4.606534090909091
2707406,5,B000LE17A2,"I tell my wife that I buy the Justice League season-releases for myself AND the kids. But it is me who sits most captivated in front of the TV with the kids as the episodes roll.

Shushing the kids so I can hear ""cartoons"" on TV is the joke my wife likes to make. I quickly correct her, ""Justice League is NOT 'cartoons.' It's an 'animated series.'"" This clarification for some reason always seems to bring on even more chuckles over a bottle of wine with friends than it does clarify the matter.

Anyway, indeed the kids sit captivated too. The Justice League stories are very well put together with a lot of detail. I'm not sure that my kids (age 3 - 7) appreciate or understand all of the emotion (sometimes pretty deep), heroism (of course), betrayal and just great story telling that goes into these Justice League productions. But rest assured, Justice League Unlimited is definitely for kids too.

First there are Seasons 1 & 2 of Justice League. Then came 26 episodes of Justice League Unlimited in Season 1. Season 2 is perhaps the final compilation of Justice League Unlimited that contains the last 13 episodes that started last fall and ended in spring of 2006. You get:

1 - ""I Am Legion"" Say hello to the Legion of Doom.

2 - ""Shadow of the Hawk"" Friends with Hawkgirl...what's not to trust?

3 - ""Chaos at the Earth's Core"" Warlord of the rings.

4 - ""To Another Shore"" Wonder Woman and The Viking Prince.

5 - ""Flash and Substance""  A night at the museum.

6 - ""Dead Reckoning""  Carnival of souls.

7 - ""Patriot Act""  General Eiling goes AWOL.

8 - ""The Great Brain Robbery""  The great role reversal.

9 - ""Grudge Match""  Ultimate Fighting championship.

10 - ""Far From Home""  There's no time like the future.

11 - ""Ancient History""  The Hawkgirl soap opera continues.

12 - ""Alive!""  Houston, we have a problem.

13 - ""Destroyer"" Our heroes ride off into the sunset.

It is not necessary to have viewed the previous Justice League Seasons to fully comprehend and enjoy Justice League Unlimited Season 2...but I highly recommend it.

There are hours of entertainment on all of the Justice League releases...and no dang gong Cartoon Network commercials! Well worth the purchase price.",1166832000,83,2200,4.634715025906735
2707407,5,B000LE17A2,"Yesss, it's about dad-blasted, dag-nabbin' time WB got off its fat bum and completed this awesome series on DVD.  These are the final 13 rip-roarin' episodes, including some of the best ones of the series.  At long last, this overgrown kid will have at least one complete series in his DVD collection.

  I can't say I have a single favorite episode.  Two of the saddest ones to me are ""Far From Home"", which involves an unexpected twist with one of my favorite characters, and ""Destroyer"", simply because it is the very last episode.  It's also one of the best because of the incredible fight between Superman and Darkseid.  Supes finally gets to throw down all of his restraints and let it all out.  Don't you know he's wanted to do that for a looo--ong time.  ""Grudge Match"" is a great one, too.  Talk about the ultimate chick-fight -- oh yeah!  I kinda thought the ending might have come out similar to the race between Superman and the Flash in an episode of Superman TAS.  That one was a tie.  Canary vs. Huntress - ehh - flip a coin.

  Overall, I give the series itself five stars for its great story lines, dialogue, and animation.  Obviously, I can't rate the packaging and features until next March.  I've already pre-ordered it.  I can hardly wait.  I'll consider it a very late Christmas gift to myself.",1165968000,21,1316,4.562231759656652

Several other superheroes against Lexus Luther, Grodd, and so many others.  Having this in my collection makes me so happy!!

The only con; nothing to do with the show itself, or the packaging but when buying this product and others like it always be sure to check the discs to make sure their not scratched.  This is the 2nd time I've had this happen where my disc was scratched.  I had no way of knowing until I watched it because of how much I work from day to night I watch an episode a day, so the first few seasons took me a little bit to finish watching.  So I never checked the back of the disc until it was too late to return the product.  I'd have expected the discs to be like new.  So always, ALWAYS, check the discs after receiving the package, I learned my lesson

But other than that issue, this is a Great deal, great season, awesome show, any DC fans will want to add this to their collection Pronto!",1464134400,,1081,4.158653846153846

2707443,5,B000LE17A2,"This is the final season of Justice League/Justice League Unlimited.  At 13 episodes, it's shorter than previous seasons.  Despite this, however, the quality remains consistent; some highlights of the season include the episodes ""Shadow of the Hawk"" and ""Ancient History"", which finally introduce Hawkman to the DCAU, and one of my personal favorites, ""The Great Brain Robbery"", which does a classic body switch comedy with The Flash and Lex Luthor, and the formation of the DCAU version of the Legion of Doom.  As far as the packaging goes, this is my only criticism of the set. The two discs are stacked  Venn diagram-style (as with previous seasons) and the episode list is contained on the back (also as with previous seasons); however, the package itself is very thin, so it doesn't fit in next to the three previous seasons on a shelf, and the box with the two discs doesn't slide out of the outer envelope (unlike the previous seasons).  That's honestly my only criticism, and I spent too many words describing a problem that's so minor it might as well be nonexistent.",1453680000,,1076,4.85792349726776

I loved Batman the Animated Series as well as the other fox kids superhero line up, and when DC moved their properties to WB kids, they never quite got back to how good things used to be.  They really seemed to ignore a lot of their adult audience I think.  While Superman the Animated series was very strong, this is not quite as good.  That being said, this is still a very strong series that manages to cover a lot of the DC universe and after watching the show in it's entirety, I have to saw that I am very pleased by how it was able to consolidate massive story arcs and essentially dumb them down for kids, which really isn't as bad as that sounds, because simplifying and getting down to a story's essence without giving up the main parts of the story is what good editing is about, just wish there was a little more darkness and a little less kiddie stuff, but that is what you are getting here.  For parents, this is very kid friendly.",1383868800,,1031,4.239795918367347

I've marveled at how Bruce Timm and a crew of some impressive writers, animators, storyboards, and many others brought DC Comics to life. The voice actors they casted were absolutely brilliant, from 1992-2008 a Bruce Timm animated series was guaranteed to impress you on so many levels. Even the current Green Lantern: The Animated Series fits into that category. But let's talk about JLU season 2, how could they top JLU season 1? Well they didn't.... I will not give any spoilers but they didn't expect to get another 13 episodes and it clearly showed. They even admitted behind the scenes that they didn't have anything left after wrapping up season 1, so they decided to ""have fun"" with the final season. Clearly not his best work, there are some cool/funny moments with certain characters (no spoilers remember).

My favorite episodes are ""The Return,"" this is where a super powerful android wants Luther Lexe's head.

2707663,5,B000LE17A2,"I really wish JLU had a 4th season, I enjoyed it more than the regular JL animated series. It focused on a lot more heroes then the core members of JL animated. Bringing back the Legion of Doom from Superfriends along with nods to the made for cartoon superfriends characters (Apache Chief,Black Vulcan,Samurai and the Wonder Twins as the Ultimen) the JLU series seemed to just let go and have fun. And in my opinion that is what made the series fun to watch. It had a balance of humor, some nods to DC cartoons of the past, and finally got to see lesser characters finally animated for the first time, like Viglante etc.

It went out with a bang though ,the ending with the Darkseid Superman fight, and seeing all the heroes and villians battling the invasion from Apokolips was comic book joy.

So if you haven't seen JLU or have and like to own them to watch whenever you want, I would highly recommend picking up the two box sets, I don't regret it.",1357603200,,953,4.409090909090909

But skimpy outfits with bulges and huge tits falling all over themselves and grasping and groping and French kissing is a not at all appropriate for children. So these are fine for the comic book geeks I guess, but where can a paren get good clean cartoons of super heros that they can comfortably show their children for fun and entertainment? It's not as simple and easy as you would think. Even the old batmans with Adan West had a stint of curvaceous catwomans and batgirls, but they did it with class and respect, show the curves but not the GD cleavage, kids do NOT PROCESS THAT the way adults do, and that's NOT a good thing or in a good way.",1353801600,,965,4.3076923076923075

It was an extrodinary adaptation of many of the current storylines, as best as they could be for a cartoon series. This by far was not a Super-Friends retread. This actually has a decent directors commentary on some selected episodes. Mark Hammil, voice of Batman's Joker, was interviewed for this collection.

Luthor is invited by Gorilla Grodd to join forces with the powerful Legion of Doom which now consists of the most powerful and deadly super villains in existence.

With the Legion of Doom, Luthor heads to the far edge of the universe where the remains of Brainiac have been located. As Luthor and the Legion start to resurrect Brainiac, they accidently revive an even deadlier menace, Darkseid.

Some episodes are epic while some are lack luster, usually depending on the writer. This whole season, I thought, was lack luster, aside from The Great Brian robbery and Destroyer. It seems they are rushing to establish the arc in this season, but the threat presented by the legion of super villiany never ammounts to what cadmus was in the 3 and 4th seasons.

Besides the not-for the-faint-of-heart multi-angle and super fast paced action/fight sequences we have new landscapes and tons and pounds of digital animation improvement. Highlights: (this one is for me) Supergirl in the classic costume and a modern touch(Bruce, I owe you this and I am eternally grateful to you), plus the kicking butts attittude and the major character development! Superman gets better and better, Kevin Conroy as Batman just rocks! Darkseid is now unbeatable! A super KICKING girls wrestling in Grudge Match!.

I personally enjoy all the commentary",1184371200,3,252,4.25
2707742,4,B000LE17A2,"I've not really followed the Justice League comics, but I had heard good things about the TV Show for some time. So, when Amazon suggested I purchase it with another DVD (curse you suggestive sell!) I picked it up. If you are like me, I would suggest you get the first season, as there are a few special features that relate to storylines covered in the first season. However, the storyline of Season Two is fairly contained and there are only a few references to what has gone before.

Each of the episodes was well animated and voiced, but I think the Season's strongest aspect is the story arc that runs through most of the Episodes. The season focuses almost more on the evildoers than the heroes, showing the plotting of a collection of enemies, a sort of ""Injustice League"" as the core story arc. The writers really had fun with the bad guys and spent a lot of time focusing on their plans, machinations, betrayals and plots.

I'm sure someone would enjoy this more if they were more familiar with the characters, but even for someone new to the show and the universe it was great fun. I'd recommend watching the first season first, but other than that this is a great DVD set.",1183939200,3,1183,4.497674418604651
2707743,5,B000LE17A2,"Producers/writers Bruce Timm, James Tucker, and Dwayne McDuffie thought that season four would be the end of the series; however, Cartoon Network, which broadcast the show, gave the go-ahead for thirteen more episodes, making for a fifth and final season. Thus, the creative team pulled out all the stops and delivered stories that were tightly woven, brilliantly animated, and superbly acted by regular performers, as well as featured players.

These are some of the most entertaining shows of the five-year-old series.

Acting-wise, Kevin Conroy has had close to twenty years providing the voice of the animated Batman and he knows the character backwards and forward. Kudos should also go to Clancy Brown's ""Lex Luthor,"" Michael Rosenbaum's ""The Flash,"" Carl Lumbly's ""Martian Manhunter,"" Susan Eisenberg's ""Wonder Woman,"" and Maria Canals' ""Hawkgirl."" And one cannot overlook the contributions of recurring actors and their characters: CCH Pounder (""Amanda Waller), Michael Ironside (""Darkseid""), Powers Boothe (""Gorilla Grodd"") and J.K. Simmons (""General Eiling"").

The best episodes on the disc are the homage-to-things-past ""I am Legion,"" the delightful ""Flash and Substance"" and its similarly constructed ""The Great Brain Robbery,"" the reflective ""Patriot Act,"" and the two-tiered punch of ""Alive!"" and ""Destroyer,"" both which bring back favorite villains Darkseid and Brainiac.

Though billed as a ""children's show,"" there are hints of bestiality, sexual innuendo, political correctness gone overboard, and bloodless battles that feature implied decapitations and/or deaths in massive explosions.

However, apart from that (and a serious lack of the Question) season two offers the same quality storyline, humor, and entertainment that we've come to expect.  It's only half as long as the other seasons, but old fans of Justice Friends will appreciate the Legion of Doom plotline, and the last two episodes are amazing.

Great buy.  If you've got the other three seasons, you definitely can't pass this up, but you certainly don't have to have seen the others to get your money's worth of entertainment out of this season.",1182816000,2,676,4.647058823529412

If you have Justice League - The Animated Collection Season One (2001), then that should be the ONLY one for you.  Why?  The stories and characterisations are so far superior than this disapointing collection.  Justice League Unlimited is an example where producers and directors struggle to make a coherent storyline and in addition, over-use mindless action fighting sequences, display hereos with a sure-to-be KO'D in any episode that do not offer anything exciting or NEW to the stories. It's been done to death and frankly it's the same old same old. It's a pity, because this series had potential, but in my opinion fails to capture the essence of the heroes or give a point for why this series was ever named 'unlimited'. The only thing going for this series and season one of JLU is that you can say:  Hey there is Vigilante, there is Vixen, I saw Red Tornado!  So if you have a burning desire to see obscure heroes or villains that never made it in any other moving picture medium, in pointless stories, then this is for you, but if you want to see the finest, just be content with the 2001 edition of JL and forget the rest.

The Warner DVD authoring is very typical.  No chapters to skip the annoying 90's style theme (again the JL 2001 is better). Interesting to hear the creators comments, but they just contradict themselves. There was nothing wrong with the original Super Friends series (which are coming to DVD).  At least the Super Friends was more entertaining, and in time will out shine the JLU as the JLU becomes more and more outdated.",1179100800,,1624,4.611111111111111
2707751,4,B000LE17A2,"I loved JLU when it came out, the arching story was just incredible.  This final season is only 13 episodes and the very ending battle of the last episode just ticked me off, but otherwise most of the episodes are good and you get to see a whole lot of bad guys fighting.

One thing I really appreciated about this season is that they seemed to know it was their last so they went all out.  Characters get killed, actually killed, left and right.  There's an awesome episode where the villains get in a power struggle between Luther and Grock which results in some BIG time characters being executed when their side loses.  It gives the season a rather unique and edgy feel I've never really seen in a cartoon before.

About the animation, it's a superb way to finish the DC Animated Universe.  It's a pleasure to see the Darkseid/Apokolips storyline (than began in Superman The Animated Series) coming to and end.

It's a 5 stars animation.  Sadly, the lame decision of banned the spanish subtitles and audio deserve a score of -1 stars

2707774,5,B000LE17A2,"This volume of JLU collects the last 13 episodes of the action-packed series, which saw all the bad guys form their own super group in an attempt to match the Justice League. It also features character turning points for J'onn J'onzz, Shayera (Hawkgirl), Green Lantern, Supergirl, and oddly enough Lex Luthor.

After the intense Cadmus story arc from the previous season, the show switched tones here to become more action-oriented. There's an emphasis on having fun with the comic book material, and exploring obscure corners of the DC universe. Brain-switching, girl fights, lost worlds, viking princes - it's all here in geeky glory. Objectively the Cadmus season remains the strongest of the show's run, but these episodes still hold up very well - they're smartly written and backed by excellent direction and animation. In all, a fitting end to a universe of adventure which began in the original Batman: The Animated Series.

To make up for the last volume's lack of supplements, there's a Cadmus featurette here hosted by Mark Hamil. The new mini-commentaries squeeze a ton of information in while eliminating dead air, and the isolated score to the episode 'Destroyer' is a feature that fans have wanted for some time. The only screw up is the packaging, which features images from last season's batch of episodes.

2707790,2,B000LE17A2,"In the now-legendary movie ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" these lines are spoken by its main character, who seeks to understand a world he can barely touch, yet wants all for himself.  They also pertain heavily to the last season of JLU, and to all fiction in general, really.

After all, fiction is... what?  Just a bunch of phony people spewing canned lines at each other and trading attacks once in a while on a stage made of deserts, plains, cities and even whole planets, or is it more than that?  Is fiction a hundred worlds within one?  A world inside each heart, and a billion hearts in every fiction.  The workings of the human heart are so complex that we could never fully understand it, but fiction never stands out firmer in our minds than when we try.

For this reason, ""What does it mean?"" is the question I ask myself whenever I experience any type of fiction.  What makes the characters behave the way they do, and what impact does it have on the grander scheme of things?  What clues can I gain as to the contents of their hearts?  How can I continue to grow in understanding of them?  In short, how can I draw myself even further into their world?

These questions are intelligent, valid ones that make perfect sense with any fiction, and it's because of these questions that modern television is such a wasteland.  Characters are hardly ever complex or engaging, and they drop no clues that their minds contain anything other than the programming of their writer.  Sadly, this is also true with the last season of Justice League, and the main reason it fails to satisfy.

Previous seasons of the Dini/Timm animated Universe (even so far back as the first season of Batman; the Animated series all the way through the fabulous JLU season 2; 1 on the DVD release,) rewarded viewers for asking these very questions.  In fact, for a long time, they were all the television I watched.  The fact that many characters (such as, for instance, Luthor) were altered very rapidly to fit into a desired plot even as far back as the first season of JL was, in my mind, frustrating, but virtually unavoidable.  Still, they gave Luthor reasons for doing what he did.  Flimsy reasons perhaps, but they made sense in context.

What doesn't make sense is the very idea of Luthor obsessing over Brainiac's remains, trying to ressurect him as if it's the only thing he's ever wanted.  Brainiac is just a computer program.  He's not omnipotent, and the only reason he represents power to Luthor was because he managed to assimilate the Dark Heart near the end of JLU season 2, which is now destroyed.  If Luthor ever merged with Brainiac again, without the Dark Heart's power, he'd be fodder for Superman's fist.

A more logical course, for Luthor, would have been to try reassembling the body of Amazo (who I'll rant about more in a moment,) since Brainiac's consciousness clearly still resides in Luthor's mind.  This would give both of them what they really want.

Unfortunately, the Luthor of this season is seen as being selectively more and less intelligent than he actually is.  Luthor, for instance, is a scientist, but by no means is he able to design a machine that can travel faster than light, as he does by the end of this season, and if he really WERE that intelligent, why didn't he make the leap of logic that I just made?

Getting off Luthor for a moment, let's move, grudgingly, to Darkseid.  I say grudgingly because, frankly, Darkseid's been done.  That doesn't mean they couldn't have used him as this series' ""end boss,"" just that he'd (A) have to be way more powerful than before, and (B) that power source has to be defined, as it was with Dragon Ball Z's Frieza (who was still small change afterwards in his respective series.)

Unfortunately, the big problem with Darkseid isn't the fact that it makes no sense that he's as big a threat as he is, it's that his attitude seems to have changed.  Although he professes to want nothing less than Superman's death above all else, and to generally want to make people suffer, he willingly violates his New Genesis treaty and yet seems to have a sense of humor as well, which none of his previous incarnations indicated.  In other words, he's become both more, and less aggressive, which makes no sense.

Now, moving on to Amazo, as I promised to do, let me stick my tongue firmly in the direction of the Warner Brother's marketing department.  Pictures of Amazo and Solomon Grundy are all over this DVD set.  In previous seasons, these two characters were among my favorites because, in order to use them, the writers had to do some work thinking of realistic motives and methods for them to use.  Grundy never really did anything without a reason that made sense to him, and was far more complex than was at first thought, and I don't think there IS a character as physically or mentally complex as Amazo in any universe.  As I said, both are plastered in pictures all over this DVD set (between two to four of Grundy, depending how you count, and a clean four of Amazo,) yet neither of these characters actually appears in the season contained in the packaging.  Thbbbbbbbbph...!

What does it mean?  I asked myself this question after watching each episode of this set, and after every single one, the answer was ""it means nothing at all.""  No.  I lied.  Not every single one.  There is one episode in this entire season that seems to have some meaning behind it, and that's ""Ancient History,"" but one out of thirteen isn't so great.

The action sequences of this season were okay, but action without meaning is just a nerve-deadening factor like the rest of television.  Even the best of the bunch (such as Superman's last battle with Darkseid) was anticlimactic and short, and no better, at its best than what one might get on, again, Dragon Ball Z.

Prior to this season, the Modus Operandi of the DC animated universe was to take classic DC characters and bring the most out in them.  Not so with this collection.  Sorry, but I really can't picture myself wanting to watch any of these episodes again.  From now on, the series ended with ""Epilogue.""",1175385600,3,6128,4.632993512511585
2707791,4,B000LE17A2,"As they admit in the DVD extras on this set, the creatives behind Justice League Unlimited (and, in several cases, the animated DC Universe going back to Batman: The Animated Series) really didn't expect this season to exist.  It shows a little - how do you top ""Star-Crossed"" (the finale of the Justice League series) and the Cadmus arc (JLU Season 1 and the creator's intended finale for the whole shebang)?  The answer is that you don't, but that doesn't mean that this set isn't a whole lot of fun with some moments of genius.

The animation has grown in leaps & bounds (pun intended) since Batman, and the CGI that began to show up in JL: Season 2 is more seemlessly integrated than ever.  The voice cast is astounding, even for the already impressive roster who have worked on Batman, Superman, Batman Beyond and earlier seasons of this show.  Clancy Brown really steals the show as Luthor, though, especially with his laugh-out-loud performance in ""The Great Brain Robbery"".  The writing is up to snuff, especially considering that they weren't shooting for the gravitas of the two previously mentioned Justice League finales.  In addition to Brain Robbery, there is a lot of fun to be had in eps like ""Flash & Substance"", ""Grudge Match"" and the villian showcase ""Alive!"".  And the two Hawkman shows, ""Dead Reckoning"", ""Far From Home"" and personal favorite ""To Another Shore"" excellently inject some pathos, develop characters and tie up some plot threads from the overall continuity of the universe.

The extras are slight but informative (which has become the norm for these WB releases), and worth it just to watch Mark Hammill geek out discussing Cadmus, a season he wasn't really involved in.  Basically, if you've ever enjoyed any of the cartoons that lead up to this set, you'll enjoy this.  The second best season of JLU is better than most animation out there.",1175212800,4,1876,4.849529780564263
2707792,3,B000LE17A2,"I'm a little surprised by the glowing reviews for this collection.  After the terrific Cadmus arc from the previous seasons, season 2's (actually season 3's, but I digress) Legion of Doom idea, while cool in theory, often comes off as silly, anti-climactic, and contrived.

In regards to the first point, don't get me wrong--a little silliness is okay.  Flash swapping minds with Luthor is pretty funny.  But Luthor rocketing the legion's entire headquarters into space?  Uh, yeah.  Or Luthor somehow figuring out how to take control of the Justice League's female members' minds?  Right.  (By the way, if he could somehow manage this, why not just take over the minds of all the League's members and call it a day?)

And the series definitely ends on a somewhat anti-climactic, farfetched note.  As if Darkseid's resurrection was not stretching the limits of believability already, his so-called defeat by Luthor and the ridiculous anti-life equation was simply puzzling and laughable.  Deus Ex Machina, anyone?

And there are other numerous disappointments.  Both Superman and J'onn are nearly absent through most of the season, Batman's intriguing relationship with Wonder Woman is ignored, and far too many villains are apathetically killed off in what is little more than a throwaway scene.

On the plus side, I did enjoy the Hawkman saga, most of the Flash episodes are enjoyable, and the Legion of Superheroes story is good (although can you really see Kara giving up her own time period for, um, Braniac 5?!).  But in the end, this season is not nearly as well-planned and envisioned as its predecessors.

And shoot, considering how well the previous season finale conclusively ended the series up to that point, season 3's plethora of unanswered questions and loose ends is almost unforgivable.

Anyway, anyone owning the other seasons might as well grab this one too, as it's still entertaining material.  But if anyone is expecting this set to be of the caliber and quality of previous installments, he will likely be disappointed.",1175040000,10,2042,5.099397590361446

I do have a question for anyone who has bought this set though. I'd like to order it but when I saw it at Best Buy I noticed that it didn't have the ""enhanced for widescreen TVs"" tag that JLU season one had. Does it play in widescreen on 16:9 TV's?

2707796,5,B000LE17A2,"Or Justice League Season 5, depending on your viewpoint. Thoroughly captivating. Most stories focus around a DC character previously not seen on tv, including Viking Prince, Deadman, the Golden age Hawkman, and others.

This was an excellent way to wrap up what I call the Kevin Conroy voice artist continuity of Batman appearances (which ran from his own series in the 1990s, to guest shots in Superman & Static Shock, the Batman Beyond series (which is also well worth buying) and Justice League. Sadly the Wonder Woman/Batman romance is abandoned half way through the previous season, but the fans have written many sequels on the fanfiction site.

Although still dating Vixen, Green Lantern still manages to draw Hawkgirl's attention away from Hawkman (to my disappointment, I must say. Hasn't John Stewart been busy enough with Katma Tui and Vixen?

Darkseid returns in the last two episodes for the final fight with Superman, wrapping up a conflict which ran from Superman's own show into well-written sequel in Justice League season 2: ""Twilight"". Luthor forms a new secret society or Legion of Doom, making this season an obvious re-invention of 1978's Challenge of the Superfriends.

Loads of DC characters to enjoy. Great complex serialized storyline.

If you enjoyed the Legion of Super Heroes appearance in Superman: New Kids on the Block (TAS), you'll love the way they return with more characters in this DVD set's ""Far from Home."" Supergirl's disappearance from the 20th century is handled much more positively than the way she died in the 1986 comic ""Crisis on Infinite Earths."" I won't spoil the plot, but you'll love it.

At this point, I hadn't written my letter to Warner about the decline in soundtrack music quality and ridiculous exaggeration of the difference between men's and women's bodies in all their DC cartoons. They did listen though. Check out the Legion of Super Heroes show on tv (which I also suggested to be a series in that letter), and the fantastic music opening Season 5 of Teen Titans will hopefully be available on DVD soon too.

2707799,5,B000LE17A2,"The last volume of Justice League Unlimited was a surprising inclusion of both seasons one and two of the revamped and renamed Justice League series. Though they aired pretty much in their entirety with maybe a month pause in between some episodes, JLU seasons 1 and 2 was for the most part a long running arc that spanned 26 half hour episodes. Known as the Cadmus Arc, it initially started by introducing new characters like Green Arrow, The Atom and The Question, while also bringing in a few lesser known but well loved characters like Captain Marvel, The Question and Booster Gold, as well as bringing in returning characters like Superfirl, and Aquaman. By the 14th episode things began to darken for our heroes as they were thrown into government schemes and disention in the ranks. All in all a great arc.

JLU season 3(which is volume 2 and listed as season 2) got back to the series roots, smack down drag out fights between superheroes and supervillains. Drawing from the vast history of the DC Animated universe, including the Superman, Batman and Batman Beyond animated series, this season harkens back and pays absolute homage to the Challenge of the SuperFriends show from the 70's. Without giving it all away, the villains have become tired of losing to the JL and have decided to band together as a form of protection. Where once they were a Society or or a Injustice Leauge, now they are LEGION. Yes the Legion of Supervillains has returned and now have an army big enough to pose a threat to the JL's own army of heroes. This was a great finale for the show, and ended on a high note, with the heroes once again braving amazing odds, and always fighting a never endign battle against the forces of evil. This all started with Batman's animated show way back in 1992, and the last scene in the show is the Bat symbol as the screen fades out.

Pleasant looking animation done with intelligence, style and the occasional dash of wit. Well written with substance which never insulted our intelligence nor was the least bit annoying.

In other words: absolutely NOTHING like the Cartoon Network of today.

I guess ""JLU"" wasn't cacophonous, clattery or filthy enough to make the grade on the CN. Wish the CW would smarten up and resurrect this jewel. Bring back all of the original voices and creators and give us fans some more great episodes, as we weren't ready to give this baby up. Do for ""Justice League Unlimited"" what the CN did for ""Family Guy"" (they did the opposite for the wrong show, in my opinion).

2707804,4,B000LE17A2,"I'm REALLY gonna miss this show......The final episode ""EPILOGUE"" from the last JLU collection (supposedly the original JLU series finale) gave an already excellent closure connecting JLU's Cadmus plotline with the whole Batman/Batman Beyond mythos......Fanboys all over were rejoicing at the production of one more JLU season collected here (which is actually Season 3 - how did Warner's marketing get so confused about this?)....

  Everybody loves to hate the bad guys, or at least we're always curious about how they think & live so dangerously! The formation of the Legion of Doom was a real treat, as we see evil geniuses Grodd and Luthor butt heads to claim leadership. I just can't get over how Clancy Brown's delivery of Luthor gets more deliciously devious - both he and Powers Boothe's Grodd had arrogantly witty lines - ultimately revealing their individual hubris' as the most exploitable shared flaw among all great villains.  Just recall Grodd's expression before being blown out of the airlock, or Lex's horror when he sees a reconstituted Darkseid instead of Brainiac - all too precious moments of comeuppance, indeed!

  The voice casting / direction / performances in these shows have been near-perfect, so much so that I'll miss hearing them on air after years of familiarity.  The great Kevin Conroy IS the Batman of all eras, absolutely as irreplacable as Clancy Brown.  And Michael Ironside's Darkseid can really cast a shadow on anyone's day- albeit I thought he needed just a wee bit more volume / reverb to exude more of the biggest bully in the Universe!  I wonder who else from the STARSHIP TROOPERS movie they can cast in these episodes (Mr. Brown & Mr. Ironside were in it!)?

  I honestly didn't really care too much about the Hawkgirl / Hawkman soap opera - I thought Hro Talak in the Starcrossed movie was a much more compelling character delivered onscreen.  I also agree that J'on J'onzz

was lacking in appearances, but I guess that was all set up for the finale.  I wish Captain Marvel had at least one last cameo during Darkseid's invasion - if Supes & Luthor could put aside their differences for an episode or two, why not Billy Batson?  Two hilarious Flash episodes, Grudge Match, and Far From Home were definite payoffs for the fanboys......I'm gonna miss all the ups-&-downs, laughter & some tears (again, anybody recall the ending of Starcrossed??), and all the heroics that these shows brought out in the last 5 years......

  I only have this final JLU season recorded in DVD-R, so I cannot be overly technical on their quality.....But in terms of great storytelling, action & characterizations in the superhero genre, this is as fleshed-out as it can be for all audiences to enjoy, much better than most live-action movies of any kind nowadays!  Now, maybe Bruce Timm & Co. can do an origin movie about the JLU in the Batman Beyond era (prequel to The Call episodes, I guess?) ??

It's sad to see this series end,there's hardly any quality superhero animated shows on TV right now, but I look foward to it's release on DVD.",1168473600,8,521,4.831460674157303
2707806,5,B000LE17A2,"After a brilliant season finale with Epilogue where could this masterful series have gone? Bruce Timm and company gave us a comic book geeks ultimate wet dream with Justice League's final season. This season brings the formation of one of DC's most memorable creations, The Legion of Doom. This time it is not 13 villians it is more like 50 of them. It is also the first time that some of these villians are scene in animation for the first time.

This season is truly one for the fans. It is classic Superhero against Supervillian. Arch enemies pitted against one another. It is also the first season that Hawkman is finally brought into the Bruce Timm animation universe. As well as other faces such as Deadman, Captain Cold and Devil Ray (But we know him as Black Manta ;-)) The whole season shows the mystery unravel as the Justice is trying to figure out why suddenly all of these villains are coming out of the wood work causing trouble. The best part of this season is the conflict between the two villanous powerhouses Gorilla Grodd and Lex Luthor which leads to a fantastic and at some points hysterical brawl. Still nothing can prepare you for some of the revolations that take place towards the end of the series as well as the most amazing battle between Superman and Darksied that is so huge it takes two episodes to finish it. Although this is the final season of probably one of the greatest animated dramas of the new millenia it is great to know that the show ended one a good note with only the satisfaction of the fans in mind. To Bruce Timm and company thank you for all your wonderful work from 1991-2006",1168300800,14,1625,4.5272108843537415
2707807,5,B000LE17A2,"The second (well, actually fifth if you drop Unlimited out of the title) season of Justice League Unlimited sadly ended up being the last of the excellent DC animated series.  These final 13 episodes sees the villainous Legion of Doom uniting against the JLU, and reaching a catastrophic conclusion.  The original Justice League members; Superman, Batman (still voiced by the great Kevin Conroy), Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkgirl, and Martian Manhunter, are all here, as well as other Leaguers like Green Arrow, Supergirl, Black Canary, Huntress, and Hawkman, are all here, as well as villains like Lex Luthor (still voiced by the excellent Clancy Brown), Darkseid, Gorilla Grodd, Killer Frost, Toyman, and Dr. Polaris among others.  The animation is still awesome, and there's even a bit of character development among the villains to boot, which is simply wonderful.  As the season, and series, reaches a close; it becomes apparent that like the Batman animated series before it, Justice League Unlimited was a show ahead of it's time.  If there's any negatives about this collection, it's that some characters are downgraded (Martian Manhunter disappears throughout most of the season) but the good greatly outweighs the bad here.  With numerous odes to classic DC comicdom, as well as the Superfriends cartoon, Justice League Unlimited goes out with a bang.",1167696000,13,1373,5.275229357798165

Well, the ride had to end sometime. JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED: THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON is the culminating season to this excellent animated series and serves to put a capper on the DC Animated Universe, which consists of BATMAN: T.A.S., SUPERMAN: T.A.S., BATMAN BEYOND, STATIC SHOCK, and ZETA PROJECT. While the current THE BATMAN and LEGION OF SUPER-HEROES continue the tradition somewhat, these new shows do not follow the same continuity.

This ""second"" season is, technically, the third season of JLU (or, even more comprehensively, the fifth season of JUSTICE LEAGUE) as JLU's ""first"" season dvd set actually contains Seasons 1 and 2. Hopefully, that wasn't too confusing to follow. Anyway, this dvd set offers the final 13 episodes in glorious wide screen and continues to showcase lesser lights from its expanded superhero roster (Hawkman in two episodes, the Warlord, Deadman, Green Arrow, the Huntress, etc.) as they are teamed up with several of the original seven founders.

Several episodes pay homage to CHALLENGE OF THE SUPERFRIENDS by updating the Legion of Doom, a haphazard collection of supervillains put together to combat the JLU, which then becomes the season's major story arc. Yes, there's even a Hall of Doom here. And, when we aren't privy to Gorilla Grodd and Lex Luthor engaging in power plays as they vie for the leadership of the Legion, we get to see highly diverting, self-contained episodes such as ""Chaos at the Earth's Core"" (I used to collect the Warlord), ""Flash and Substance"" (featuring a Bats/Flash team-up), ""Patriot Act"" (which salutes the Seven Soldiers of Victory and, in a way, resuscitates the defunct Cadmus Project), and ""Far from Home"" (on her 21st birthday, Supergirl, with GL and Green Arrow are transported to the 31st Century and meet the Legion of Super-Heroes).

Meanwhile, the superb ""The Great Brain Robbery"" (which has Luthor and Wally swapping minds) is a favorite Legion of Doom episode of mine. The Legion of Doom storyline, by the way, climaxes with the last two episodes, ""Alive"" and ""Destroyer,"" as the writers throw out all the stops and bring back powerhouse villains Brainiac and Darkseid. By the way, the monumental clash between Superman and Darkseid is a must-see.

In my opinion, there isn't a lot of bad moments in this season (or in the entire series, come to think of it). Like a reviewer already mentioned, the disappearance of the Martian Manhunter for a significant portion of the season and the somewhat inconclusive resolution to Shayera and GL's often turbulent relationship are two which fall more in the negative category. And whatever happened with Batman and Wonder Woman's flirtations? Also, I wish the Blue Devil or Blue Beetle had been featured in a show (after all, Ted Kord's best bud, Booster Gold, starred in his own episode). On the positive side, the stories and the animation continue to be amazing. The stellar voice actors maintain their high quality work as they consistently add depth and resonance to their characters. Much as the Batman, as voiced by the iconic Kevin Conroy, and the Joker, by the versatile Mark Hamill, have been firmly embedded in my brain, so, too, now, are Michael Rosenbaum's Flash, Phil LaMarr's Jon Stewart, Maria Canal's Hawkgirl, Carl Lumbly's J'onn J'onzz, Susan Eisenberg's Wonder Woman, and Clancy Brown's Lex Luthor. George Newbern ends up being pretty good as the Man of Steel, but I still prefer Tim Daly. Sorry.

What started out, innocently enough, in 1992's definitive BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES has, over the course of 14 years, expanded into an animated universe in which so many significant DC costumed players have made an appearance. It's been such a sweet ride. I just want to state that never in my wildest dreams did I expect the JUSTICE LEAGUE (UNLIMITED) to be this good and this addictive. Thinking back, I probably was basing my expectations on the fun but ultimately shallow and juvenile Hanna-Barbera's SUPERFRIENDS. This current reincarnation offers so much more in terms of depth, emotion, story, scope, and creativity. The characters in JL and JLU are multi-layered, have inter-personal exchanges and conflicts, and do change and grow like real people (Hawkgirl being a prime example); the writers (Paul Dini, Bruce Timm, etc.) did such a fantastic job of making the viewers care for their product, the sum of 91 sincerely produced episodes. I'll miss the Justice League on television very, very much. Just thank goodness for dvds, huh?",1167177600,136,4514,5.0932432432432435
