8734147,1,B015ONJ562,"I like Shakespeare, and I've seen a lot of productions of his plays.  One of my favorites has been ""The Comedy of Errors.""  This production is terrible.  Way too much slapstick as a means of extending the play (Shakespeare's shortest).  The slapstick doesn't enhance the experience of the play; it's an annoyance.  I stopped watching halfway through and should probably sell my DVD of this production since I'm quite sure I'll never again try to view it.  Find the Judi Dench/Roger Rees/Michael Williams version from decades ago.  It holds up well and presents the humanity of the play play as well as the comedy.  Or (and?) try to Roger Daltry version.  He does a great job.  But don't watch this version--it will turn you against what is, in other productions, a lively and enjoyable play.",1506384000,,791,4.792592592592593
8734148,5,B015ONJ562,No body does Shakespeare's plays like The Globe! This is a very engaging production. Easy to follow the action.,1484179200,,111,4.894736842105263
8734149,2,B015ONJ562,"Five years ago, Shakespeare's Globe toured North America with a ""Comedy of Errors"" performed by only eight actors. As directed by Rebecca Gatward it was wild, inventive, almost improvisational---and this new production by the same company doesn't measure up. Except for the enjoyable interactions with the live audience (something of a Shakespeare's Globe trademark), Blanche McIntyre's staging ranges from stodgy to desperate, with the strain painfully evident in this television transcription. Some of the key roles are miscast, and the mistaken-identity mixups don't play in closeup. For a more imaginative and focused version look for the older Richard Monette production for Canada's Stratford Festival (on CBC home video). Unfortunately, the funniest ""Comedy of Errors"" was telecast on PBS almost 30 years ago but hasn't yet been issued on home video. It's the Goodman Theatre/Robert Woodruff edition with the Flying Karamazov Brothers. I have an off-the-air copy and it still holds up.",1474848000,4,992,5.576158940397351

8734152,5,B015ONJ562,"An early Shakespeare comedy done as a slapstick farce, which is only appropriate since it is based (like ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"") on a farce by the Roman playwright Plautus.",1459987200,,198,4.527777777777778
8734153,5,B015ONJ562,The Comedy of Errors by Shakespeare's Globe theater company is an excellent production like all their productions. The stage is authentic and the the amazing actors involve the audience. They always have fun with Shakespeare at the Globe.,1458345600,4,238,5.2894736842105265
