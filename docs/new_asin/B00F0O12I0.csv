5962419,4,B00F0O12I0,"To Hear the Music tells about a different kind of hitech: the pre-18th century hitech of ""tracker"" organs, whose keys are directly connected to the pipes. Thanks to Dennis Lanson, people outside Cambridge, Massachusetts of the last 50 years can learn how, along with all the computers and biotechnology, a former Manhattan Project physicist Charles Fisk went back to basics. How Harvard University, known for its early founding and modern reputation, would merit a newly-built one of these natural organs. What I enjoyed most, from the interviews in this documentary was to hear how a varied group of technologists and musicians grew together into an inspired community as they built The Opus 139 for Memorial Church. More than engineering, more than art, different from religion, definitely spiritual.",1417910400,2,802,5.322834645669292

8611157,5,B00F0O12I0,"If you have an interest in pipe organ building, specifically the history and current philosophy of the C. B. Fisk company in Gloucester, MA this is a must-see video.  The organ business in America is challenged by several factors - decline in demand for organs due to changing preferences in contemporary worship, less demand for organists, too many builders competing for fewer orders, increasing costs of production and competition from electronic instruments.  To a great extent this video explains how the Fisk company survives and thrives through interviews with officers and individual contributors and outsiders who are knowledgeable about the business.  Fisk's success may be attributable to its collaborative engineering and manufacturing processes where ideas are freely exchanged and combined to achieve the most favorable outcomes.  The company produces mechanical action instruments using appropriately modern designs and materials.  The video itself has very high production values - great photography and audio.  A preview of this video may be seen on the C. B. Fisk website.",1516665600,,1090,5.575757575757576
