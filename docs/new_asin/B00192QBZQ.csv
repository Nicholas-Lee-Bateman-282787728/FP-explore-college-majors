8271617,5,B00192QBZQ,"I really love every episode, I watch them again and again. Robot head is a riot and Xev is as sexy as can be. Kai plays the straight man and Stanley the idiot. Sometimes it gets a little slow but it picks up pretty fast. There are a lot of twist and turns that really keep you off balance. Sometimes you can't even guess what is going to happen, this is good.",1256601600,,359,4.0
8271618,4,B00192QBZQ,"I was initially happy to find this available in a nice clean set...still happy to have it.

Little did I know the horrors to await me.  It was my first experience ordering and I didn't realize I had signed up for 1 button ordering...I suspected there would be some final page that would let me make a final decision to buy, or not, but there was none.  I ended up getting 3 copies, and found out that I would have to pay some sort of re-stocking fee of 10% or so.  So, I tried to find a friend who might want it for Christmas...but no-one had my love for the series, so I got stuck with them, and NOW I see that they are being sold for $20 (I paid $50-ish).  They are still in their wrapping plastic, so maybe this Christmas I can find someone to take them off my hands (at a 60% discount...Not!).  Don't be misled, I AM happy with the one I got, but that 1 button ordering sucks.",1251331200,,880,4.057803468208093
