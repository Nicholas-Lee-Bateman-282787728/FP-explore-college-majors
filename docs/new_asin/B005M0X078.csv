4831599,5,B005M0X078,"I was lucky enough to see this live in the US on October 2nd and like my fellow reviewers, it was ""PHANTASTIC""!  I have seen the show twice before and loved it and have always loved the beautiful music.  Andrew Lloyd Webber did a great job with this (along with Cameron Mackintosh) production.  Ramin and Sierra shone as the Phantom and Christine.  I'm not going to lie -- I wan't sure about Sierra at first since I had never heard her sing before, but she's amazing.  And Ramin...my goodness!  I saw him as Enjorlas in the 25th Anniversary Concert of Les Miserables as well and he was so powerful there.  I knew he'd make the perfect Phantom.

What I really loved about this was you truly felt like you were not only there at the Royal Albert Hall, but that you had a front row seat (better than a front row seat even).  The close-ups are amazing.  And this was not in a concert style format like Les Mis was last year.  It was the entire show (nothing left out!!) with the actors actually acting, not just standing at a microphone singing.

The end of the show was just...I still, after two weeks of seeing it cannot even begin to explain the ending/encore.  Of course ALW came out and gave a speech and then introduced the original London cast minus Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman.  I was a little bummed but of course, he announced them after the cast had come out.  So great to see both of them and I must say Michael looks as good now as he did in 1986!!!  And Sarah...wow.  She sings 'Phantom of the Opera' as four past Phantoms (including Colm Wilkinson, John Owen Jones and Anthony Warlow...there was one more but I forgot his name) came out and sang with her.  It was great!  But that wasn't it.  The four Phantoms (plus Ramin) sang the most beautiful version of Music of the Night.  I got goosebumps.  It was just gorgeous!  I wish that Michael Crawford had sung as well, but I'm guessing he had a good reason.

This is definitely a DVD worth buying and watching over and over again.  I know I will!",1318550400,52,2016,4.369272237196766
4831600,5,B005M0X078,"Like all the other current reviewers, I saw the live broadcast at my local theater, and I was so impressed by the acting and moved by the music.
Compared to every other version I have heard or seen, this was by far the best. The actors have this expressiveness that make their roles so believable. Their singing was near perfect (it was a live performance, so not entirely perfect)
I had only one complaint to the performance, and it was the chandelier. I had looked forward to that heart-stopping moment when the chandelier swings down, but it only sparks. I understand that it may have been because of the theater's limitations, or for the safety of the audience, but that iconic moment changed stung a little.
Otherwise, I recommend this version to every fan of the phantom and will definitely be pre-ordering the DVD myself.",1318377600,11,828,4.7172413793103445
4831601,5,B005M0X078,"I saw the performance in the movie theatre on October 5th and 11th, and agree with the other reviewers. A thrilling spectacle! Sierra Boggess as Christine is (I think) better than Sarah Brightman; Hadley Fraser's Raoul is gripping - a powerful and beautiful voice. And I think the best looking Raoul as well! Ramin Karimloo as the phantom is excellent. All the players give very moving and heart-felt performances, not only in their singing but in their facial expressions and movements as well. The camera does take you on stage (better than a front row seat), as well as panning around the theatre before the performance and at intermission to give you the idea of 'being there'.
Seeing Andrew Lloyd Webber, Michael Crawford, Sarah Brightman, and the original production 'creators' on stage afterward was magical!
If you love the Phantom, you really need to see this!",1318377600,16,869,4.958904109589041
4831602,4,B005M0X078,"I just got back from watching this exact performance at my local theatre, and I must admit, I am most impressed.

I was frightened that this might not be a staging at all, but more along the lines of a ""concert in costume"" much like the dissapointment I felt when I saw the Les Miserable's concert on Public TV.

Fear not.  This production is pretty dead on to the staging that appears in the shows that I have watched live, and considering this was filmed ""live"" and simulcast, it is truly a sight to behold.

While this performance can't even compare to ""being there"" it is far removed than the sterile affair put on the screen by Joel Schumaker.  Don't get me wrong.  There is plenty of things I like about the movie, (like the spine tingling opening sequence, or the red hot sexuality of Point of No Return).  But this by far is the most accurate ""filming"" I have seen of any ALW production.

Unlike Joseph, JC Superstar and CATS, which were ""staged"" recordings specifically for video, with all the ""cuts"" that go with it, This is a live filming that was simulcast live around the world on Oct 2, 2011 and ran on limited encore performances in movie theatres for the next few days.  There are no ""best performances"" or ""second chances"".  We get what was actually presented to the audience on Oct 2, and that alone is worth the price of admission.

Due to the height of the roof of the Royal Albert Hall and either logistics or safety concerns revolving around hurling a Chandalier from such a dizzying height, suffice it to say, the chandalier does not crash to the stage at the end of Act 1, nor does it ""float"" from the stage in it's glory during the overture.  Instead, the tarp is removed during the overture, and fireworks accompany the chandeliers destruction at the end of Act 1.  This is sure to be a bit of a disappointment to most Phantom fans, and if you need to experience a crashing chandalier, you will have to go to one of the live performances currently touring around the world.  On the plus side there are quite a few shots of the show taken ""throguh"" the chandelier onto the stage below, which gives you the feeling that you are the phantom, spying at the action below from top of the chandelier.  It's not as dramatic, but they did what they could and it's hard to fault them for something that was probably completely out of their control.

The production also makes extensive use of LED screens as backdrops much like was done in Love Never Dies.  This can is be both effective and a bit disconcerting.  One example is the backdrop of Andre and Fermin's office, which is setup to look like a wall with opera posters posted on it.  From a distance, these work fine.  However, some of the cameras are really close to the stage and causes this effect to pixelate greatly which takes away some of the suspension of disbelief.

The use of LED screens is also used to mimic Christines Mirror during her Angel of Music number in which Christine approaches the mirror with the Phantoms face singing in the upper right corner of the mirror.  Towards the end, the screen simply slides away to review the Phantom walking towards her with the fog rolling at his feet.

Another different use of the screens is during ""Notes"" when the phantom is reading how Christine is to star in 'Il Muto, we see handwriting appearing as well as the phantom singing his instructions on how Christine is to be granted the role of the dutchess while Carlotta plays the pageboy.  One cool effect that the LED screens provided was during the end of Think of Me, Christine faces the rear of the stage, and the actual applause from the live audience is projected on the rear screens giving the audience the feeling that they are behind Christine and their own reaction is the reaction of the ""audience"" who just watched her aria from Hannibal.  It's hard to describe but a cool efect.

It's also fair to note that these ""screens"" were necessary given the sheer size of the arena, and in the vastness of the RAH, some consideration had to be made to those in the nosebleed seats, so we see some scenes where the Phantom is projected on the real wall so that the paying customer in the back can better see the action.

It's just that they lose much of their effectiveness when filmed.

Speaking of filming, the camera work is stunning.  Thanks to HD and the extreme closeup we fully see the emotional range the Phantom shows at his love/hate relationship with Christine.  Some might say we see too much as I was distracted by wrinkles in the Phantoms facial prostesis where it was peeling from his neckline.  Proof positive that this was shot live.

The performances from the cast were spot on, and it's amazing how I find different parts of the musical which resonate with me depending on the production.

In the live stage productions I have seen, the ""Phantom of The Opera/Music of the Night"" sequence always sent shivers down my spine.  The motion picture's rendition of ""Past the Point of No Return"" has a sexual tension and animal magnetism not experienced on any stage performance I have seen.  The stand out number for me in this version clearly was ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again.""  This has never been a favorite number of mine until now.  Sierra Boggess really sells that performance and my mouth was on the floor when it was over.

The Phantom in this production is also more believable.  Ramin Karimloo brings out an anquished performance of a ""monster"" with the heart of an ""artist"".  His makeup is not over the top but grotesque enough to give someone pause.  My biggest beef about the motion picture is that no woman in her right mind would have rejected Gerard Butler's Phantom.  Even with his ""hideous"" makeup he was way too pretty.  A slight rash, a droopy eye and a swollen lip?  Really?  I've seen uglier people at Wal-Mart.  But Karimloo's Phantom is sufficiently hideous.  You sense the bravery it took Christine to kiss him in the final scene and that courage is not lost on the Phantom, which leads to his change of heart.

One suprising highlight was the role of Carlotta.  In all the past performances, Carlotta was portrayed in Caricature.  Nowehre is this more apparant than in Minnie Drivers over the top performance in the film.  Here, Carlotta is almost a sympathetic character.  She clearly fears not only the Phantom, but also the rise of this ""precious little Ingenue"".  She clearly see's Christine as a threat to her dominance at the Opera and we see a true human side to her as portrayed by her fear when the piano starts playing by itself during the rehersal for Don Juan Triumphant.  In the past Carlotta had always been a throwaway part, but in this performance it is done with an authenticity that I have never before seen.

Overall, the show is brilliant and I am ecstatic that it will be coming to DVD/Blu-Ray.  Unfortunately Phantom is no longer touring in North America, so my chances to see it live require a trip to New York, or Las Vegas to see the ""truncated"" version.  And if my children never have the opportunity to see it live, at least they can appreciate this version.  While it is nowhere close to experiencing Phantom for yourself, it is definitely more authentic than the movie, and slight staging differences aside, is as accurate a staging of the original show as could be done in the venue that it was pressented.

One final bonus is the appearance on stage of the surviving Orignal London Cast including Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford.  Unfortunately Michael does no singing, but we do get two numbers with Sarah and four previous phantoms.  The Phantoms are outstanding, but clearly Sarah's voice lacks the punch it had 25 years ago.  This is not a criticism but just a fact of growing older.  It was still nice to see the original production team on stage.

While it seems I have levied quite a few criticisms in this review, it is simply there to let you know what you are getting before you buy.  The performance was outstanding and much more accurate to the original show than the movie.  If you are a fan of the original show, you will find plenty to like here.  If you are a fan of the movie, you will see different nuances than was presented by the film.

Anyway, however you look at it.  At it's core, it is still Phantom, and a mighty fine one at that.  A must buy for anyone who loves this show, and anyone who has yet to see it performed on stage.",1318291200,861,8423,4.5471447543160695
4831603,5,B005M0X078,"The DVD will contained the live streaming held on October 2, 2011 at the Royal Albert Hall.  I had the privilege of seeing it in the theater in the U.S. on 10/2/11 and once again on 10/5/11 as a rebroadcasted Encore performance.  I'm so excited that I'll be able to watch it again and again.  The taping of the show and cinematography were spectacular.  You by no means feel like you are in a seat in the audience watching it from may rows in front of the stage.  No, you are up close, on stage, beholding closeups of the various performers play their iconic roles to perfection.  You see the costumes like you've never seen them before, the rage and hurt in the Phantom's eyes, the conflict and yearning of Christine for two men.  The performances of Ramin Karimloo (Phantom), Sierra Boggess (Christine), and Hadley Fraser (Raoul) are nothing less than brilliant, as well as the rest of the cast.  If you love Phantom on stage, you'll love this DVD. The after performance reprisals of the Phantom of the Opera and the Music of the Night with legends such as Sarah Brightman, Anthony Warlow, John Owen Jones, and Colm Wilkinson will move you to tears, plus the appearance of Michael Crawford, Andrew Lloyd Webber (of course), Cameron Mackintosh, and Charles Hart.  This DVD is a Phantom keepsake indeed.",1317859200,246,1303,4.6798245614035086
4831604,5,B005M0X078,"For the 25th anniversary of Phantom Andrew and Cameron did a fully staged concert version of pretty much the whole show at London's Royal Albert Hall complete with minor set piece and fully  costumed with a cast and orchestra of over 200. (More complete then the movie just a like cut here or there NOTHING to really get excited over.) This version is nothing short of incredible. Now fans of Sarah and Michael DON'T KILL ME, please. I saw this in the theater for the live broadcast and was amazed by the performances in this. Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess, who co-starred in the ""Phantom"" sequel ""Love Never Dies"" in London, reunited for the special production and with amazing chemistry. Having grown up on the OLC recording and owning about a half a dozen others I've never grown to really like the piece outside of the original cast. Maybe it's nostalgia for it or just the way others have sung it but this time I was blown away. Never in my life have I cried at this show until now. Ramin's Music of the Night was like hearing the song for the first time all over again and Sierra's high notes are flawless and clearer then ever Sarah did back in her early days. The odd standout performance for me was of all things Kiera Duffy as 'Carlotta'. She brought a fullness and venerability to the role I never ever thought about and her look go absolute terror during the rehearsals for The Phantom's opera still sticks out in my mind as genius.  The performances in this alone make this for me THE version of phantom.  Visually one should know off the bat that the chandler does not crash down... it is after all just a concert. The staging is mostly done with LED screens which, while not MY preferred thing, are alright. Small set piece are brought on and off and the costumes are all here in their glory. While I hope the LES screens don't make their way into the regular staging they did help to set the mood for the night, but it was hands down the cast and orchestra that makes this astounding.  At the end there is the usual speeches and bringing out of the old cast and Michael and Sarah are there and while Michel doesn't sing Sarah does. She sounded eh.. ok... I wish she would get over her whole singing-with-my-arms-in-front-of-me thing but it was nice as she was backed by four past phantoms.  That all is just sprinkles and dusting on what I hope will be looked back as one of the finest performances of this show ever done.",1317859200,215,2442,4.45413870246085
4831605,5,B005M0X078,I saw this live on Oct 2 and it was stunning. The set design was brilliant and the acting was supurb. I adore Sierra and Ramin as Christine and the Phantom. They're the best since Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford. I was disappointed that Michael Crawford didn't sing with Sarah Brightman. It would've made it that much more special. This is a spectacular musical and a timeless story that will live on long after we're all gone.,1317859200,26,432,4.623376623376624

4831660,5,B005M0X078,"I hate love stories, but I understand why Phantom is addicting. This version has amazing singers, beautiful and colorful costumes (YOU HEAR THAT MOVIE PHANTOM, YOU NEED TO HAVE COLOR IN A COLORFUL MASQUERADE NOT JUST PEE YELLOW AND DOO DOO  BROWN). I streamed this, and I think it is best. Maybe on DVD  you can have more special features, but for a girl who wants something good albeit kind of stupid at times playing. I mean in one scene they set up a plan with the main protagonist trapping him, and this gurl all confused and tormented saying ""I can't face the phantom it's so scary and traumatic,"" then comes back 1 second later acting all okay with it. THere's also a woman who is like the mouthpiece of the phantom and threatening people to do what he says, I'm like ""Lady, do you work here? Do you get paid? Can we use who to trap this fool?"" And then, the Phantom goes up to people saying ""I'm going to sit in my regular seat in the balcony so don't try any funny business."" This boy is threatening us and you're tellin me we reserve a seat for him every opera night?
But there are some really great parts like the singing, funny parts that are actually funny, it has a strange and bewitching horror element, and of course the ""Point of No Return Song,"" Awesome! Maybe that's why people like it. With all the stupid stuff, what's entrancing is the idea of a romance, but at the end I think it is more of a man learning how to grow up instead of becoming more monstrous just because people think of you as one. Because of that, the reviews about it online, and more , this is a great guilty pleasure for college students, women, men, vagabonds, wenches, children, pets, and of course lonely and bitter but are intrigued of the idea of romance(so basically me).

4831721,5,B005M0X078,"I'm just going to take a moment and Phangirl gush here, because this show!  The music!  The costuming!  The sets!  The Phantom! I swoon...

The first time I saw Phantom live, I'm fairly certain I forgot to breathe for most of the first act. Many years later, I've lost count of how many times I've seen it in different theaters, and yet this performance gave me the same chills and breathless reaction as the first time I saw it.  Ramin, though younger for the role than expected, puts such heart and emotion into the performance at every turn.  Sierra Bogess is love, elegant, and a charming Christine.  I could continue with every talented person gracing the stage, but I'd wear thin on superlative adjectives.  Suffice to say, I enjoyed every moment, especially bringing other stars from the musical on for numbers afterwards.

Some of the effects are different from the traditional stage play due to both venue and stylistic constraints.  You'd know if you were looking for them *coughchandeliercough* but the items that were a nice touch - watching the Phantom write the notes - balanced out the missing parts - Raoul on the portcullis.

I'll be watching this one at least yearly, kudos to all involved in making it.",1515715200,,1221,4.761904761904762

4831782,5,B005M0X078,"I'm a die hard Phantom fan and have been since my grandma took me to see it on Broadway for my 13th birthday some 20+ years ago. However I am a bit of a ""purist"" and did not like the movie adaptation at all. So when I saw this on a lightning deal I had to give it a shot and purchased it for myself. In the first two weeks I had it I watched it 3-4 times and I truly loved it!
I wasn't sure if I would like it for a couple reasons. 1-I've been listening to the original London cast soundtrack for so many years and I wasn't sure how I'd get used to the voice and wording variations. 2-there's no epic chandelier flight as in the Broadway play. But I've been so desperate for another Phantom experience that I wanted to see this version. I'm so incredibly glad I gave it a shot. Sure the actors, and thus the voices and ultimately the songs, are different, but this cast does a beautiful job with their performance and I was absolutely moved to tears! And of course we'd all prefer the epic ""flight of the chandelier"" BUT I understand it wasn't possible in that space, and am able to overlook that for the great performances and always beautiful story of the Phantom.
Nowadays when I Spotify Phantom and they throw in song versions from this production I immediately know them and enjoy the variation (although I will always be partial to the version I grew up with).
And when you thought it couldn't get any more magical you get an amazing performance by Sarah Brightman and ""the Phantoms"" which is so special for me! Now that I've seen it and enjoyed it repeatedly I can't wait to get a copy for my grandma to enjoy as well!! Watching this DVD did something that my obsessive listening to the original soundtrack hadn't quite completed for me... it inspired me to finally read the actual book which I've been meaning to do for years. For so many reasons I'm so glad that I gave this a shot, and now writing this review has got me thinking of watching it again this week!",1506556800,,1971,4.28686327077748

I fell in love with it the first time I saw it live on stage in 1999. have the 2004 movie, but the singing in that version is subpar. Karimloo and Bogess are amazing together and have a lot of chemistry with one another. I love Crawford and Brightman and there have been a lot of great people in the role, but these two have to be my favorite pairing. This stage version blows the movie out of the water and brings so many emotions to the surface. The orchestra is also awesome and the whole production was very well done. I did actually laugh a little because there are a couple of times that you can clearly see Karimloo's tattoos under the cuffs of his shirt. It's something that If you were sitting in the audience you would never have been able to notice, but because of the close ups of the camera they become noticeable. It's not distracting enough to take away from his hypnotic voice though. If you're a fan I highly recommend this dvd.",1498694400,,992,4.310160427807487

BUT nowhere on the packaging or in Amazon's item description does it say Region 2 for the DVD... which means the DVD will not play here!
(In my attached pictures, nowhere does it show the region code. I looked at some other DVDs for comparison and usually the number is printed on the back and/or on the disc itself.)
I tried it in multiple DVD players and all gave error messages; the PS4 recognized the different Region Code but prompts you to change the PS4 settings to play it.
Thanks goodness I tried it out first and didn't blindly set out the unplayable DVD at school for a substitute teacher!

The Blu-ray disc is fine, and there's one small bonus feature on it.

I'll be asking for a return/exchange from Amazon and I guess that means I will have to buy a separate Blu-ray and separate DVD because this item was the only combo pack for sale.

I have seen The Phantom live on Broadway, but had to sit in the worst seats imaginable--in the nosebleed section.  I can't even remember who played the characters.  So when I got this DVD and played it, I was overwhelmed by the production.  It was perfect in every way.  The actors were all great as well as the orchestra.

The revelation for me was the performance of Ramin Karimloo as the phantom.  What an incredible voice and his acting was so good that I actually teared up at the end, when the Phantom realizes that he will never have Christine.  So poignant and heart-breaking.  I am now a huge fan.

Sierra Boggess was perfect as Christine.  Beautiful face, extraordinary voice and and acting.  Her chemistry with Ramin was so intense that when she interacted with Hadley Fraser as Raoul (who also did a fine job), it was difficult to imagine what she saw in him.

That was not the case. The blu-Ray plays fine, but the DVD will not play in any player I have tried it in. I just get a message stating that it is not compatible or an error reading disc message. So, even though I absolutely love the musical I was very dissappointed that the DVD was useless and therefore completely undermined the whole purpose of ordering the multipack.

First, I am a Phantom phanatic, from Leroux's literary masterpiece to nearly every version put to film. It is nothing short of pure magic how ALW created such a score that suits the source material. This DVD puts you in nearly every spot in the hall, from the stage to the loftiest balcony. Performances are solid all around, with special praise for Ms. Boggess (Wishing you were here brings me to tears every time.). Though a huge Michael Crawford fan, I have come to enjoy Mr. Karimloo's performance.  The directing misses nothing, from the performers emotions to the orchestra lush score.

I didn't give it the full five because 1) the chandelier didn't fall; 2) Ramin Karimloo is lovely but he's not my idea of the Phantom, too YOUNG and he just lacks something; 3) having both him & Sierra Boggess in the show brought too many Love Never Dies hints into the storyline for me; 4) the CHANDELIER DIDN'T FALL!

However, it would have been nice to have a warning that the DVD included is region locked to what I assume is region 2 based on the fact that color is spelled ""colour"" on the back cover and it doesn't have an MPAA rating logo. It doesn't even list the region anywhere on the discs or cover.

What's interesting is the blu-ray plays just fine and must be region free but others have said it won't play on their PS4.

Just a warning to those out there before buying. The separate DVD and Blu-Ray releases are sadly more expensive but are listed as NTSC and Region 1 which means they will play without a problem in the US.",1482537600,,682,4.230769230769231

I would dare to say I like this moviesque version better than the actual stage play because you can better see the facial expressions of the singers.

(Sierra is so breathtakingly beautiful, particularly during her performance of ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"".)  The music, performances, production and costumes are mind-blowing and captivating.  And after the show is over, we are presented with even more goodness as the original cast, including Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, take the stage, with Sarah offering a performance of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" along with several past and present 'Phantom' performers.  Every spectacular cast member gives their all, with special mentions going to Hadley Fraser (as the long-suffering Raoul) and Wendy Ferguson as the cast-aside, but extremely talented Carlotta.

It brought me to tears when the former Phantom tenors with the female lead soprano did a sequence that was surreal.  Of course, I have seen the stage production in London and, this year, in a neighboring City.  Saw the movie at theater, on HBO and now, again on this DVD.

I'm enthralled by this particular performance, and I know many POTO fans hold it close to their hearts as well-- it feels historic, even among anniversaries, and I am so grateful to have been alive when it opened. Ramin, Sierra, and Hadley are my favorite trio, all possessing such rich chemistry with each other and the characters. Not to mention, the MUSIC! I don't see how anyone could disrespect such beautiful, emotive melodies, especially when sung by such talented voices. My friends and I return to this film again and again when we get together, we love it so much. It's well worth your money, in my opinion. If you're only going to watch it once, make it this version. It's even better if this is the first soundtrack you hear. And I recommend reading the novel, as well. Webber's adaptation makes numerous changes to the original story, and while I respect both deeply, they are very different. This is all I have time for, but YES. Simply, YES.

DID I MENTION THIS VERSION COMES WITH A REUNION OF PAST ACTORS AT THE END?

It was reminiscent of the 10th Anniversary concert of Les Miserables at Royal Albert Hall, but better because it was not just a concert, but the complete musical.

The unsung hero of the production was Wendy Ferguson who captured the role of Carlotta Giudicelli perfectly.

4832547,1,B005M0X078,"First of all, I love this DVD.  Have watched it many times on NF (you know, Amazon's main streaming rival).  Problem is with Amazon's delivery.

This title expired on the rival service, so I bought the Instant Video option on Amazon.  Wow, should have stuck to uploads on YouTube, which are about 1000% more clear.  I paid for the HD option, and yet the picture is so fuzzy I could be watching this over an aerial antenna from my youth.  This is no exaggeration -- the fuzziness hurts my eyes, and I can only watch about 20 minutes at a time.

No technical help from Amazon either.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phantom-Of-The-Opera-at-the-Royal-Albert-Hall-25th-Anniversary-Celebration/dp/B009CG1106/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phantom Of The Opera at the Royal Albert Hall-25th Anniversary Celebration</a>",1447891200,,845,5.991666666666666

My favorite part is Phantom of the Opera/Music of the Night, it gave me chills! Ramin Karimloo who played the Phantom was absolutely captivating, I simply loved watching him! He owned the role of the Phantom. I also loved Sierra Boggess who played Christine, her voice is absolutely phenomenal. These two have great chemistry, I wanted her to choose the Phantom over Raoul at the end. I watched the 2004 film and it was good but it does not compare. If you truly want to experience the Phantom of the Opera watch this live masterpiece.",1447027200,,711,4.476923076923077

4832572,5,B005M0X078,"I'm a long time fan of the Phantom of the Opera from reading the novel as a child, seeing the silent movie and then the Andrew Lloyd Webber versions.  This one here is the most personal performance of ALW's classic musical.  People can love the original cast all they want, but seeing the performances here give something new.  When Ramin Karimloo is singing some songs as Phantom, he cries and screams as if he really is the Phantom.  There's absolutely nothing negative about the performances outside the stars. Every dancer is on point, every note sung is in the right key and on cue.  The special performances at the end will satisfy a few older fan cravings, too. This is one of few MANDATORY musicals out there.",1445904000,,717,4.6141732283464565

4832685,1,B005M0X078,"I don't know who did the makeup for Sierra Boggess and Ramin Karimloo, but they look OLD in this production.  Sierra looks way too old for this part.  Christine Daae was supposed to be a young girl (teenager) and Boggess was 29 at the time of this production.  I think Emmy Rossum, who was 17 at the time (2004) Joel Schumacher's version was filmed, was a much more believable Christine.  Though she was billed as an ""unknown"", she had already been performing at New York's Metropolitan Opera since the age of seven and her performance as Christine was breathtaking. As for The role of The Phantom, Ramin Karimloo also looks way too old, appearing to have gray hair for his role as Erik.  Though opera snobs could claim that Boggess and Karimloo have more ""operatic"" voices than Rossum and Gerard Butler (Joel Schumacher's Phantom), I liked his production way better, and found his staging and cinematography, as well as Rossum's, Butler's and Patrick Wilson's (as Raoul) performances far superior and much more believable.",1438646400,,1023,4.890173410404624

8478929,3,B005M0X078,It's okay until you get to the encore.  At that point just turn off your DVD and have drink or whatever.  Sara Brightman performs at the tail end only to show that she has started losing her voice.  Better to remember her in her prime than to hear her butchering the song that made her famous.  And don't bother hoping that Crawford will sing at the end he doesn't all the other past phantoms they have on stage do but not Crawford he just sort of stand around.,1528848000,,461,4.204545454545454

I have not watched very many recorded live performances like this one but I was astonished at how well it was produced, filmed, staged, everything!

As other reviewers have pointed out, there is the slight disappointment that there is no chandelier drop at the end of the first act as there is in the current production but the rest more than makes up for that omission. If you can't see Phantom life, watching this is the next best thing by a mile. I think that knowing this is a live stage production rather than a movie makes it even more special, considering that the cast and crew only had one chance to get it right.

This is a huge, grand production complete with live orchestra, countless costumes, fantastic singing, acting, sets...this is everything you could ask for in a musical. Buy it and you won't be disappointed!",1528070400,,995,4.6158192090395485
