3487200,3,B001BAJSSI,"Scabrous political satirist Bill Maher states that 16% of the country identify themselves as secular humanists who don't believe in God. It is to this group which he targets with this 2008 diatribe against organized religion. In the process, Maher actually makes Michael Moore appear comparatively subtle and fair-minded when it comes to making provocative documentaries. There is a passing similarity to approach with Moore's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fahrenheit-9-11/dp/B000SINT52/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fahrenheit 9/11</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sicko/dp/B000UNYJXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sicko</a>, but the tone here reflects even greater hubris and more outward comedy given the polarizing subject. The tone should come as no surprise since Maher recruited Larry Charles to direct, the man who helmed the fish-out-of-water mockumentary hit&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Borat-Cultural-Learnings-of-America-for-Make-Benefit-Glorious-Nation-of-Kazakhstan/dp/B000MMMT9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Borat - Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan</a>&nbsp;and several episodes of HBO's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Curb-Your-Enthusiasm/dp/B000VXK6Z0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a>. Like the set-up of ""Borat"", this film has Maher talking to regular people and making fun of them in alternately clever and condescending ways. To some degree, it's difficult to watch the film without feeling sorry for these poor individuals who just happened to have stumbled in front of the camera.

What offsets the attitude is Maher's dead-serious intent in spreading the gospel of doubt. The film follows him on a globetrotting series of interviews with various representatives of the Western religious faiths - the Vatican, the Holy Land, Salt Lake City where the Mormon Church is headquartered, a Christian-themed amusement park in Orlando, and even a truckers' church in the Bible Belt. Maher even interviews his own mother in the Catholic church he attended as a child in order to discuss why he didn't find out she was Jewish until his teen years. Some of the brief segments are quite entertaining like the no-nonsense opinions expressed by Father Reginald Foster, a Catholic priest, senior Vatican scholar and the Pope's principal Latinist. Others are subject of justified derision like Jos Luis de Jess Miranda, the pompous founder of an international ministry in Miami, and Pastor Jerry Cummings, a former member of Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes and the leader of the Amazing Life World Outreach congregation in North Carolina. Probably the most intriguing person interviewed is Senator Mark Pryor (R-Arkansas), an avowed creationist who calmly defends his beliefs to Maher's constant haranguing by admitting that ""you don't have to pass an IQ test to be in the Senate"".

For the most part, Maher lets his subjects talk freely but ultimately forces them to answer why they hold onto beliefs that cannot be proven empirically. Much like his HBO show, ""Real Time with Bill Maher"", he talks plainly and fearlessly; but unlike his show where he parries with celebrity pundits of equal or greater stature, he receives responses that range from indifference to anger to a complete shutdown in acknowledging Maher's way of thinking. The latter holds especially true in a scene with a fundamentalist, a formerly gay man married to a former lesbian and now dedicated to converting gays. This approach also points to the film's biggest drawback, that Maher didn't choose subjects who could engage him in a more spirited debate that could make him reconsider his position if only for a single scene. The use of old footage from the movies works intermittently as comic relief between the sometimes heavy-handed interviews, but I think Maher and Charles could have done without them. Even less necessary is Maher's angry closing monologue about the dangers of mixing religion and politics since he loses his sense of humor to underline his seriousness about this topic. This documentary feature is a worthwhile viewing experience but just falls short as a thoughtful rebuke against organized religion.",1223424000,6,4351,6.154605263157895
3487201,1,B001BAJSSI,"Every once in a while a truly bad movie comes along. This is one of them. Bill Maher interviews a couple dozen adherents of religion with the goal of making them look stupid. He employs tomahawk journalism and condescending sarcasm, edits the interviews to suit his purpose, and chooses easy targets, like an evangelist who claims to be Jesus, an actor who plays Jesus at a theme park, and a ""Cannabis Ministry"" in Amsterdam. Sure, there are a few funny moments, but Maher mainly succeeds in looking horribly smug. When he tries to be personal and explore his own religious views, as when he interviews his mother, we learn nothing interesting. When he tries to be serious, as when he interviews a Vatican astronomer or Francis Collins, head of the Genome Project and an outspoken Christian, Maher looks like a badly uninformed and unprepared eighth grader trying to impress his teacher. Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, at the end of the film Maher intones with utmost seriousness, ""for mankind to survive, religion must end."" Okay, thanks for that amazing insight. This is a mockumentary mashup.",1223337600,12,1113,4.894179894179894
3487202,3,B001BAJSSI,"Immediately after watching Religilous, I wanted to rate it a five. After I had a day to think about the film, I wanted to rate it a four. Now, a few days after that, I am going to rate it a three.

Religilous is a film tracking political comedian Bill Maher as he strolls about the country and world interviewing various people of faith in order to show how stupid and funny they are. I will say that the film is quite successful on both scores. The film has a very ""Michael Moore""ish flavor to it, where the real delight comes from watching the interviewee's get skewered (while only a few seem to catch on that this is what Maher is doing, which makes it even funnier).

All of this is good and bad. As a non-believer, I have no problem with laughing at religious people and some of the whacky beliefs that they hold with a straight face. As one of moderate tempermant, however, I think that (a) Maher often picks easy targets (the anti-zionist Jew, the Trucker Christian Chapel). Secondly, after an hour and a half, Maher's interupting and coarse brand of interviewing becomes slightly less than charming if not, sometimes, simply abrasive. Much like Penn and Teller's Bullsh#t, the film is very funny for a while, but wears on you the more it plays on.

That accounts for one star. The next star deduction is because Maher's point - think Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens here - was very poorly made. Much of the film is a comedic laugh at religion only to suddenly turn very serioiusm cautioning about religion's detrimental effects and penchant for evil. The problem is that there is no build up from the first part (90 minutes) to the second part (20 minutes). The second part simply came out of nowhere and really lacked support from the first part of the film (where we only see that religion is stupid, not an evil, threatening, force.) The director should have made up his mind on which direction he wanted to go and stuck with it.

I would still reccomend that people see this film. It will make you think. It will spawn discussions. It will make some angry and others relieved. Hopefully, it will make all of us (except for Pat Robertson and Osama bin Laden) laugh. It could simply benefit from a little more substance.",1223251200,145,2235,4.552238805970149
3487203,5,B001BAJSSI,"More than any in recent memory this is the movie I have been waiting for with great expectations... and it doesn't disappoint. No holy cows are spared, as Bill Maher ridicules Christianity, Islam, Judaism and a few smaller religious sects in the name of rationality and intelligent doubt.

The film is a documentary largely carried out through a series of interviews conducted with religious leaders, believers and a few skeptics. Highlights include an interview with evangelical, and none too bright, Arkansas Senator Mark Pryor and a Jews for Jesus believer who hopes that the end of the world will occur in his lifetime. The laughs are side-splitting and they just keep on coming throughout the movie.

One thing I particularly enjoyed about this theater going experience was how the audience seemed to bond through the shared moments of laughter. Living in the South, those of us who are not religious are vastly outnumbered by the fundamentalists that this film so joyfully satirizes. So to feel that sense of camaraderie with my fellow skeptics was a wonderful feeling. As Maher says, it's time to come out of hiding and let our voices be heard!",1223078400,99,1151,4.958549222797927
3487204,4,B001BAJSSI,"I'm reminded of a pivotal scene in ""Inherit the Wind,"" when Henry Drummond and Matthew Harrison Brady debate each other over Bertram Cates, on trail for teaching his students Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. ""Do you think a sponge thinks?"" Drummond asks. ""If the Lord wishes a sponge to think,"" replies Brady, ""it thinks."" Then Drummond gets to the heart of the matter: ""Does a man have the same privilege as a sponge?"" Brady says, ""Of course!"" in frustration. ""Then this man,"" proclaims Drummond, pointing at Cates, ""wishes to have the same privilege of a sponge! He wishes to think!"" What's interesting is that a sponge absorbs whatever it comes in contact with, remaining inside until a firm hand forcefully squeezes out the contents. The obvious analogy is that we are like sponges, and religion is one of the many things we tend to absorb. Bill Maher, a smart, witty, controversial man, is the hand that wants to squeeze religion out of us.

He makes his point abundantly clear in the Larry Charles documentary ""Religulous,"" a made up word that combines ""religious"" and ""ridiculous."" Organized religion, according to Maher, is a neurological disorder. You may agree with this, or you may not. All I can say is that this movie represents his opinion; it is not out to tell you what you should or shouldn't believe. That being said, it's silly to think that all audiences will respond to this film. If you're a person of faith, then Maher will essentially be making fun of you all throughout. He also interviews numerous people practicing the three major religions (Christianity, Judaism, and Islam), and he spends most of the time talking over their opinions in an attempt to refute them. On the other hand, he continuously asks what I feel are very intelligent questions. If God is all-powerful, why doesn't He just vanquish the Devil? How can He be a jealous God if He's also a loving God? If Christianity is a monotheistic religion, why does it refer to a number of divine beings, such as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit?

One of the few intelligent answers Maher got related to that last question, and it struck him just as much as it struck me. It came from an actor who portrays Jesus at the Holy Land Experience theme park in Orlando, Florida. Never mind the fact that such a theme park exists, and never mind that they show reenactments of Jesus' bloody crucifixion on a daily basis (to throngs of cheering tourists, I might add); the actor that works there still poses an interesting idea. The Holy Trinity, he says, is a lot like the solid, liquid, and gas phases of water--they take on different forms, yet they're made up of the same stuff.

Are religion and faith made up of the same stuff? Is it possible to believe in the spiritual but not the religious? Can one be open to the idea of a universal source while rejecting the idea of God? I often wonder what position Maher takes; despite the fact that he despises organized religion, his views on the existence of some divine force remain unclear. He considers himself an Apatheist, someone who believes that God has absolutely no bearing on how we live our lives, even if He does exist. I guess it doesn't matter what he believes. The fact that he admits to not knowing one way or the other proves that he's actually thinking, which, as Henry Drummond would assert, we all have the right to do.

This doesn't say much for the people Maher interviews around the world, most of whom are so steadfast in their faith and yet completely at a loss to explain themselves. One such person is a reformed gay minister from Florida, now married to a reformed lesbian and has three children. Another is Jeremiah Cummings, formerly a member of Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes and now a very rich minister. Was it not Jesus who preached that it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to enter Heaven? Another is an ex-Jew for Jesus who converted to Christianity when he experienced a ""miracle."" And then there's Jose Luis de Jesus Miranda, who actually believes that he's the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, descended from a bloodline that traveled from the Holy Land through Europe before ending up in Puerto Rico. As of now, he has over 100,000 followers. I'll never be one of them, although he is oddly charming.

Larry Charles humorously spices up each interview with a series of inter-cut video clips and subtitles, all of which play into Maher's verbally mischievous tendencies. It's one-sided, but it's also incredibly funny. At least, I think it's funny. But that's easy for me to say; Maher and I can agree that Biblical fables, such as Adam and Eve, Noah's Ark, and Jonah and the Whale (excuse me--Jonah and the Great Fish) are so outlandish that they're impossible to believe in. Here's another quote from ""Inherit the Wind"": ""The Bible is a book. It's a good book, but it is not the ONLY book."" As for God, what I or Bill Maher or anyone else believes doesn't matter in the slightest. ""Religulous"" is not concerned with Him, anyway; it's more concerned with the people who do and say things in His name, not all of which serves humanity very well. This is a bitingly funny and at times highly thought-provoking documentary, questioning the faithful while at the same time questioning faith itself.",1222992000,36,5319,4.666311300639659
3487205,5,B001BAJSSI,"GLOBAL WARNING: ""If you do not have a Bill Maher, please invent or clone one. IT WILL DO YOUR COUNTRY GOOD"". We, in the US have the original and are very happy with him.

I read in Variety about a few advanced ""RELIGULOUS"" screenings in Claremont California, (August 2008) and immediately hoped in my car, drove 40 miles and rushed to see the film. Happy I did.

The film is sharp, intelligent, real, thought provoking, educational and it is HILARIOUS! Though, sometimes I was not sure ... if I should laugh or cry? Cry for the foolishness and ignorance of so many of us who believe or believed in those clowns up there on the big screen. Let's not call them clowns, because I like clowns, but call them opportunists or entrepreneurs. It is a free country, THEY can sell anything that looks right from the outside and rotten in the inside.

The film eloquently showing us, RELIGION: Business for Grabs....fast and easy. ""Religulous"" would have been 24 hrs long if he would have included all religions and sects, but tackled only the major organizations and a few odd groups like the Jose Luis de Jesus Miranda. You will have a hoot listening to this impostor.

I loved the film, and I am recommending to ALL who have some common sense and open to intelligent conversation. This film will open more dialog than The DaVinci Code, and hope it will make ""semi-believers"" question their faith or at least see that all this Religious Business is nothing else but, well... business. I only wish Bill and his creative team, would have mentioned the Inquisition and the multitude of evil crimes, these religions committed since their existence. Than again, THAT WOULD NOT BE FUNNY.

Religious+Ridiculous=Religulous. What a great title and only after I watched the film, I realized how ridiculous were ""almost"" all who agreed to be interviewed, how selfish, how brainwashed and irrational ready to tell the world how they and ""only THEY"" will be saved at the end. I say almost, because there were some great people, including Bill's mother and a few ex-religious folks, who give us a good insight of their past. All the way through the film, Bill kept us laughing and informing. Sometimes amazingly serious and sometimes just plain funny.

Have a good time, go see, rent or buy the DVD. But caution: It is not for the already brainwashed poor souls or religious fanatics! They will get angry, shout, speak in tongs (like in the film), they will hear voices from god or find 1 million ridiculous answers for all Bill's questions.

  Religion must die that man might live.  Faith means making decisions without reason.  Religions are dangerous because they allow people who do not have the answers to think that they do.

The best defense against this myth is to turn the argument around and show that the few similarities between the Christian faith and the myths of other cultures are not the result of a collective unconscious or of the co-opting of Egyptian fables by Christians, but rather an illustration of how Gods divine drama was prefigured in the beliefs of other cultures before its fulfillment in the true story of Jesus Christ.",1506124800,,744,5.0

Maher is a polarizing figure who sometimes over-relies on hyperbole and generalizations, but there are kernels of truth within much of what he says.

3487246,2,B001BAJSSI,"I like Bill Maher and I agree with some things that he says. I am not religious myself. The documentary made some good points, but the way the documentary was edited left me with a feeling of bias. In other words, it felt like the creators want to steer the opinions of the viewer, rather than leave him or her to decide on their own.  I saw it once, and wouldn't watch it again.",1492300800,,379,4.121621621621622
3487247,1,B001BAJSSI,"If a good director had removed about 90 per cent of Bill Maher from this movie, the results might have been worth watching.  Most of the people interviewed were sufficiently strange that gentle but persistent questioning would have built his case.  Instead we had Bill Maher interrupting, mocking, not allowing any interesting point to develop, and generally behaving like a smart-ass.  I was lent this DVD because I am a known agnostic and prepared to argue strongly to support that position, but I found myself sympathizing with the people he was taking advantage of.  I would like to see him confronted by someone who can make the opposing case  -  say, for example, a skilled Jesuit  -  and then I think his superficial posturing would collapse.  Religion plays an enormously important role in the world, for better or worse, and even when it's being mocked deserves something much better than this.
I think it's telling that the best part of the movie is a clip from his early stand-up years, when he recounted how, as a product of Catholic-Jewish parents, he brought his lawyer to confession.  Now that's funny!",1491264000,2,1117,4.862433862433862

When you study theology you have to study linguistic evolution, history, culture, anthropology, and many other tools used to determine a conclusion.

The few good punches that he actually lands are overshadowed by some of the worst writing and editing of all time.

think he takes down the biggest problem in our society now, THE FAITH-BASED INITIATIVE.
I wish someone would do a huge expose on HOW MUCH MONEY - BILLIONS - the church
tithes from YOU, THE TAXPAYER.  George Bush passed this stupid law, and Obama did
not repeal it, instead he said ""we can't do it without you."" Meaning: we STILL siphon
BILLIONS OF YOUR TAX DOLLARS THROUGH CHURCHES. To me, this is money-
laundering, and someone MUST expose and stop the corruption of the church before
it crushes us--as it crushed Spain right into the 1970s.  Bridges can collapse, but, hey,
we can give YOUR TAX MONEY TO CHURCHES! Does the church pay your rent?
Your mortgage? Does it house the homeless? Some of them feed people - but honey,
everything the church does, is WITH YOUR MONEY.  Enlightened countries like
Canada and Denmark take care of their people - but the US taxpayer TAKES CARE
OF THE CHURCH. This is FEUDALISM. Why oh why can't someone do a film
REALLY taking down the church and its eternal greed?",1456012800,,1098,4.591836734693878

3487391,4,B001BAJSSI,"A little extreme in some cases, but right on the nose in the majority of his topics.  He seemed to be challenged by the circular arguments that religious adherents used during the interviews to 'prove' their points to him.  But that's not Maher's fault, many of us who've had conversations with our faithful friends or relatives have run into that.

For example:
#1  I believe what the Bible says is true.  >>
#2  I believe it's true because it's the word of God.  >>
#3  I believe it's the word of God because it says it is.  (return to #1)

There's no easy way to get into a conversation with anyone in this closed loop, which is what Maher encountered time after time. When a computer program gets into a 'closed loop', it takes outside intervention to get the program to break out of the loop.  Sometimes that's an operator's actions, but sometimes the operating system itself can do it.  In either case, a programmer must review his/her errant code and find out why the program fell into the unending loop.  But even the best programmer sometimes cannot see the problem until he/she talks to someone else who can help the programmer get out the logical rut.  Often it's not the other person who 'solves' the problem; it's just the programmer explaining aloud the logic of the program.  I was that sounding board for years in my profession, I couldn't tell you how many times (probably in the thousands, though) that a programmer simply started explaining aloud the logic and he/she would see the error of his/her logic, fold up the program listing, say 'thank you' and go back to their desk and fix the glitch.

That's harder to do with a human mind because the operator of the computer, the operating system and the programmer are all one and the same.  Einstein did much of his work by doing what he called 'thought experiments'.  Those thought experiments got him out of ruts.

We can do that with ruts which we get ourselves into.  However, fear of what one might learn can inhibit one's progress because one may find that long-held tenets simply do not hold water.

I appreciate Bill Maher; he gave it a shot.",1450396800,,2119,4.582446808510638

Believers...well, they've already damned Maher to hell.  One guy in a truck stop church marched out when Bill suggested that the Bible was written by men (""You're offending my God.  I'm outta here.""). This movie is for those who feel that sometimes the best that atheists and humanists can do when encountering religious nonsense (the most annoying are the happy believers who are sure they will be swept up in The Rapture) is laugh at the craziness of religion and the costs it imposes on people -- all of the ritual, the belief, the monumental time-suck and inconvenience (e.g., the air-powered Jewish Sabbath wheelchair as a way to fool the God, who, as Maher notes, ""put you there in the first place."").  As Maher has often asked, ""Isn't life tough enough?""  One quibble: while he ended up with frightening visions from Revelations, he didn't give enough attention to how dangerous religion is, with its insistence on exclusion, hatred, conflict, and, often, apocalypse.  Most enjoyable bit: in Amsterdam (I think) he found a practitioner of ""cantheism,"" in which one smokes pot and has insights.  Maher: ""How is that different from just getting wasted?""",1439424000,,1325,4.990909090909091

3487455,1,B001BAJSSI,"I used to live in a household where I was the only person who saw Bill Maher for the crass, arrogant know-it-all he portrays on his show.
You own a gun? Neanderthal.
You dare to doubt collectivist thought? Conspiracy theorist.
You believe in God? You're crazy.
Bill engages in his usual obsequious, smarmy behavior in this ""film"" as he repeatedly tries shaming people into doubting their faith in God. I'm sure the execs at HBO think it's hilarious, but I think his delivery is nauseating and droning.

Now some may think I hate Bill Maher -- you couldn't be more wrong. I do equate his work as being on-par with satanic hood ornament Anton LaVey, however I do not hate Bill. No, if anything I pray for him that some day he'll see the error of his blatant anti-Christian career works. I don't pray for him to be a contrarian or because it would somehow shame him. I pray for him because I believe in Jesus Christ as the Son of God made flesh and resurrected to heaven. Everyone who believes in He and God the Father also once endured a time in their life that they doubted or scorned Him. Well, if I came to Jesus, so can Bill.

Remember I mentioned Anton LaVey (not his birth name, by the way)? What do you think he did on his death bed? He called out to Jesus. A career satanist and just before it all went dark, he came to Jesus. And that is why we should pray for our detractors and enemies rather than return their scorn.",1439251200,7,1426,4.317164179104478

Yes, the church system of today is nothing but a business using God and the Son, but you really have to read the Bible, Old and New for yourself with the only teacher, the Holy Spirit and leave the rest up to man.

Why don't people use logic instead of blind faith?  He also states something which is sure to offend many when he mentions that the bible was created by man and not a so-called god, and not edited very well neither.

3487556,4,B001BAJSSI,"When Bill Mahers Religulous (2008) premiered, it predictably opened to mixed reviews. Narrated by Maher and directed by Larry Charles, Religulous is a scathing criticism on what the filmmakers see as inherent ignorance and immorality within religion.

Critic Brian Orndorf wrote:

Most of the ammo is reserved for Christianity. Instead of confrontations that shatter myths and raise consciousness, Religulous goes for cheap laughs, manipulating footage to make the participants resemble complete boobs. Maher has the sense to pump the brakes around Islam, treading carefully. Salient points are made about this furiously hot-potato faith, but Maher is noticeably outgunned, challenging the history of Islamic bloodshed from behind the comfort of news clips and sheepish concessions. The way the Middle East rumbles these days, how could anyone blame him?

Indeed, the first third of Religulous concentrates solely on Christianity. However, Maher, who wrote the film, was raised as an American Catholic, though with a Jewish heritage. Often, writing is most effective when it focuses on what one knows, and Maher seems to know Christianity. Yet, what he primarily depicts is a particular variety of fundamentalist Christianity. While polls vary in regards to the percentages of American liturgical Christians in contrast to fundamentalist Christians, few would argue that the latter comprise the bulk of stereotypes of the faith.

Mahers perspective on Catholicism suggests he believes it resembles a Protestant evangelical faith. Most post-Vatican II Catholics today would not identify with such views. One could even question the extent of Mahers exposure to Catholic education, even in a pre-Vatican II environment. His portrayal of Revelations as a literal doomsday book is undeniably filtered through an evangelical lens. Yet, from its earliest history, Catholic readings have predominantly interpreted it as a metaphorical work, written in a popular period genre. It is not viewed as prophecy but, rather, as a book of the past, which sounded a warning regarding the first great persecutor of Christians: Nero.

Neeley Tucker of the Washington Post addressed Mahers rudimentary knowledge of religion:

One of the rules of satire is that you cant mock things you don't understand, and Religulous starts developing fault lines when it becomes clear that Mahers view of religious faith is based on a sophomoric reading of the Scriptures and that he doesnt understand that some thoughtful people actually do believe in some sort of spiritual life.

While Maher was not writing an academic paper, his film could have benefited considerably from consultation with theologians. Mahers goal, however, wa to make an entertaining and amusing documentary. The late Roger Ebert concurred:

Its not what the movie is about, its how its about it. This movie is about Bill Mahers opinion of religion. Hes very smart, quick and funny, and I found the movie entertaining, although sometimes hes a little mean to his targets. He visits holy places and talks with adherents of the religions. Or maybe talks with is not quite the right phrase. Its more that he lines them up and shoots them down. He interrupts, talks over, slaps on subtitles, edits in movie and TV clips, and doesnt play fair. I took a guilty pleasure in his misbehavior.

Of course, Maher doesnt have to play fair and anyone who can identify with being targeted by unethical, nonsensical, overzealous fundamentalists could, likewise, revel in Mahers intellectual bad boy approach. Indeed, as a humorist Maher accomplishes what he sets out to do and, in the process, reveals that proverbial fire-behind -the-smoke clich is authentic.

There is an almost equal amount of fire behind the smoke in criticisms that Mahers film is biased, takes cheap shots, and picks easy targets. Yet, for too long the antics of extreme right wing evangelical kooks have been dismissed as the rants of an inconsequential, extreme fringe. While the moral majority is certainly not a majority, and their interpretation of morality can be debated, their influence is vast enough to warrant Religulous as an imperfect but essential documentary.

Religious ignorance is seen in many media-worthy examples. Daily, we read of murders motivated by religion. Or, on a more cartoonish level, an embarrassing example can be found in the scores of people lining up to purchase greasy chicken in a show of support for a fast food magnates expressed desire to deprive same-sex couples of civil liberties. An equally absurd illustration might be found in ratings spikes for the television series Duck Dynasty after its star publicly delivered a religious diatribe against the LGBTQ community. American-styled evangelical Christianity audaciously made a potential celebrity martyr of a gun toting camouflaged hayseed who blows off the heads of ducks for Jesus.

We may claim that these are caricatured archetypes, far removed from the theologies of Augustine, Aquinas, and Julian. However, it is this barbaric parody of religion which holds sway with evangelical masses. In such a climate, Mahers lack of civility can easily be justified.

Maher is not above using religious texts against adherents. He consistently refers to the words and teachings of a literary Jesus from Nazareth as being in direct opposition to rightist portrayals of a die-hard deity. When confronting these contradictions, Maher is either met with blank stares or passive aggression, verifying the latent illiteracy which monopolizes Western Christendom. Some of the most disturbing vignettes depict Mahers interactions with Arkansas senator Mark Pryor. Maher understandably takes issue with leaders who believe in talking snakes. In defense of his childish religious beliefs, Pryor counters, you don't have to pass an IQ test to be in the Senate.

Crude retorts from the faithful are hardly alarming to those of us who were raised in an evangelical climate. With a film crew behind him, Maher is equipped with an armor of sorts (which he needs in light of his extroverted sarcasm). Without the benefit of cameras, Mahers peddling of doubt, would most assuredly have been countered with a flying fist to the face in any number of the Midwestern charismatic parishes I was forced to attend in my youth.

Maher was aware that the right-wing talk show pundits would demonize him. Feeling much was at stake, he does not care, tackling religious patriarchal mindsets with an equally patriarchal-styled skepticism. There may have been validity in this approach; he may have felt it was the only language religious Neanderthals will understand.

A criticism that I leveled against Robert Duvalls The Apostle (1997) was that the film depicted Pentecostal charisma as stemming from an impassioned love of God. Such was rarely the case in my own heritage. More often than not, charismatic outbreaks were born of intense, apocalyptic fears. Maher knows of what he speaks when issuing a warning about self-fulfilled prophecy. Reasoning is impotent against those with the capacity and desire to compose a Biblically inspired promenade to Armageddon.

Among the sharpest humor points is Mahers impersonation of a Scientologist, followed by his getting kicked out of the Vatican, and discoursing with a Jesus wannabe who claims to be descendent of the old boy himself. Maher and Charles use of cheesy animated footage to caricature a long history of Christian violence, nonsensical beliefs, and Mormonism (among other faiths), coupled with clips from crass Hollywood Bible epics, is the equivalent of fighting fire with fire. One of the most unsettling vignettes proves to be one with a Holocaust-denying Hasid.

Despite claims to the contrary, Maher does briefly engage with a few intelligent clergymen, and covers Islam and its crimes extensively (if not as much as Christianity). Hinduism and Buddhism are noticeably absent from Religulous, but the latter religion is predominantly pacifist, and its adherents often describe it as a philosophy as opposed to a faith.

Maher makes no hypocritical claims of subscribing to a fair and balanced report, yet he is as either/or in his agenda as the fundamentalists, which is where Religulous stumbles. With leadership and/or adherents, all religions have succumbed an either/or outlook. Even religions initially based on eclecticism (theosophy, et. al.,) eventually adopted an attitude of being correct in opposition to other incorrect religions.

In fairness, religion is hardly alone in this. The Surrealists imploded once Andre Breton began dictating the movements bullet points, made atheism a mandatory tenet (which reportedly prompted Salvador Dalis departure), and took an aggressive tactic against rival art movements. Comic book fans wage into internet wars over blasphemous portrayals of their characters, damn rival comic book companies (DC or Marvel), or even issue death threats to film critics who dare to give negative reviews to the latest celluloid treatment of their funny-paper deity (as they did with the last Batman movie). These subjects share attitudes we see in religion.

Religulous and Maher both have built rabid fan bases, as well as enemies. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine was not far off the mark when he wrote that Maher would have burned at the stake in an earlier age. But atheism is no more immune to black-or-white vision than any other religion, movement, and revolution. Militant atheism is a new, much bandied-about catchphrase that is actually not so new. State-mandated atheism has proven as immoral as state religion. Indeed, more people were butchered in a single day of a secular revolution (Russia) than those murdered in the whole Inquisitions history.

Where Mahers one-sidedness and naivet becomes most glaring is in his failure to see and grasp the positive benefits gleaned from religious imagination. In his two-fisted attachment to hyperrealism, Maher glosses over El Grecos Ascension, Michelangelos Sistine Chapel, Mozarts masses, Gauguins Nativity, Bruckners cathedral symphonies, and Charlie Browns Christmas, all of which were produced from religious imagination.

Maher equates religion solely with a two-dimensional perspective on belief. Belief is not something one can see, smell, taste, or touch. It can be organic and metaphoric. The late Andrew Greeley puts his finger on the pulse[1]:

The Catholic imagination invests stories with its distinctive sensibility, developing Easter lilies, Santa Clause, and the Feast of Corpus Christi. Its devotions include Mary, Jesus, angels, saints, statues, stained-glass windows, holy water, religious medals, candles. It is a verdant rainforest of metaphors.

Greely recounted the immense difficulty he encountered in his attempt to explain his aesthetic appreciation for religious imagination and mythology, divorced from dull, dogmatic concepts of belief, in his reflection on a television interview with Phil Donahue[2]:

Now, Fr. Greeley, don't you think it would be better if all those dissenting Catholics left the Church? Wouldnt it be better if only those who agreed with the pope remained Catholic? Shouldnt all good Catholics agree with the pope-birth control, celibacy, abortion, the ordination of women? How to explain in a few moments two millennium of history in which pious Catholics, even saints, disagreed with the pope? Because they like being Catholic. He threw up his hands in disgust. What does liking have to do with it? Everything.

In his assessment of Religulous, Village Voice film critic J. Hoberman wrote that Mahers case against religion is, an adolescent one that has more bark than bite.

Mahers lack of bite is indeed adolescent, although not without value. In his total rejection of religion, Maher is simply at an adolescent stage of thought . He sees its unquestionably dominant tendencies towards oppression, lack of humanism, unethical proselytizing, and immoral, two-dimensional enforcement of systematic beliefs. Maher sees a mother of four being allowed to die in a Catholic hospital, rather than being permitted a life-saving abortion. But he fails to see religious work in social reform. Maher calls out the moral contrast between imperial Vatican City and a destitute, first century Nazarene who died a criminals death, but he fails to credit a priest for also acknowledging this. Maher rightly points out that the Gospels are consistent in their condemnation of avarice (a fact which tends to be conveniently blanketed over in the empire of religious business). Unfortunately, he one-sidedly neglects to examine the extensiveness of Christian charity.

The literal minded, whether atheist or fundamentalist, lack the evolved attitude of a both/and state. Perhaps Mahers non-belief will evolve. Still, even in its imperfect panorama, Religulous may be appraised positively as functional art. If Mahers film inspires even a scant few towards critical thinking, self-reflection, or identification, then Religulous has done its job. Mahers methodology may be pubescent, but perhaps that is an effective salve to religions which are, alarmingly, still primarily locked in a primate mindset, even after thousands of years. Religulous is a trench fighters opus and a progressive half-step.

3487570,4,B001BAJSSI,"I report here I laughed throughout most of this entire picture.  Then again, I agreed with its premise: religion is detrimental to the progress of humanity.  You may very well hate it if you don't agree with that premise.  You may even feel personally offended.  At least youve been warned, perhaps thats all I can say.

Now, I said the movie was hilarious, which is odd when you juxtapose it against Mahers statement in the film: Faith means making a virtue out of not thinking. And those who preach faith, and enable and elevate it, are intellectual slaveholders, keeping mankind in a bondage to fantasy and nonsense that has spawned and justified lunacy and destruction. If you belonged to a political party or a social club that was tied to as much bigotry, misogyny, homophobia, violence, and sheer ignorance as religion, you'd resign in protest. The only appropriate attitude for man to have about the big questions is not the arrogant certitude that is the hallmark of religion, but doubt. Doubt is humble, and that's what man needs to be

This is a serious declaration and indictment of religion, nothing funny about it.  But once you view religion through Bill Mahers lens, I think youll partially agree with him, particularly when you consider Islamic Fascism, 9/11 Terrorists, Islamic Jihad, the history of Catholic Church, priest pedophilia, physician murdering Pro-lifers, Creationism and televangelism, fundamentalism and zealotry of all types.

Ive heard Bill Maher say about religions: If there was one turd in your swimming pool, would you still go swimming?  No, most people wouldnt.  I don't know if the scenario applies properly to religion.  I just know its a funny way of looking at it.

 In closing, lets remember the line from the comedian Bill Hicks routine: I was confronted by these guys in Texas after telling a negative joke about Christians.  They said, hey buddy, were Christians and we don't like what you said.  I said, Really, well, then forgive me.

I can't say if Maher's War On Faith is noble.  All I can say is, to me, it's funny as hell.",1416614400,,2076,4.8522727272727275
3487571,4,B001BAJSSI,"So, I totally agree with Bill that most religions are various versions of the same stories and characters throughout time.  But, what I think that Bill is missing, is that it doesn't matter what you believe or how you practice it....no matter how unrealistic, irrational or conjured up, as long as it motivates a person to be kind and unselfish, motivates you to treat each other the way you want to be treated, and motivates you to practice what you preach.  I noticed he did not poke fun of Buddism (sp?).....I would like for Bill to do a second documentary, this time interviewing Deepak Chopra, the Dalai Lama, and Joel Osteen.",1416614400,,631,4.675675675675675

3487644,1,B001BAJSSI,"Let me be clear...I am a former Christian and now agnostic/atheist.  I enjoy finding material that gives me solid debate material for Christians trying to convert me back. This movie isn't that, and it's not even very funny.

One of the worst claims in this movie is that Christ is a copy of the Egyptian god Horus.  I've checked into all the so called ""Jesus Myth"" stories comparing similarities of the Jesus story with ancient gods/heroes, and very few of them hold any truth, most being completely made up.  While the Romans did indeed incorporate pagan traditions and holidays into the Christian religion, the Jesus story doesn't appear to correlate to any significant mythology in a way that would matter.  Most of these ""myth"" claims say that other messiahs/heroes were born of virgins, made water into wine, were crucified, born in a manger, attended by wise men, etc... Only when you go and read the actual myths, those claims are almost all false.  Historians have been refuting these claims for some time. So why Bill Maher feels the need to cite rubbish and nonsense, as much of a myth as he claims Jesus is, I couldn't say.  But it's not in the best interest of atheists or skeptics as I have seen Christians with some real sense of history debate atheists who swallowed this tale, and spit them out dazed and confused. The atheist leaves the conversation feeling stupid and the Christian feels vindicated.  When I debate believers I want actual CITED HISTORY on my side.

There are enough inconsistencies in the bible itself, scientific impossibilities, outright flaws, that skeptics need not turn to make believe propaganda not rooted in reality to make a case. Sadly, that's what Bill does in this movie, and he does it in a sarcastic, unappealing way.  Bill, you make enough money to hire some actual researchers.

3487649,5,B001BAJSSI,"who can't find Bill funny? even when he does hateful jokes about women we all know it is in fun.  However this film really digs to find the truth in religion and how it doesn't make a lick of sense How his mother was a Jewish mom which really made the 3 kids Jewish for it comes via the mother. However his mother allowed her children to be raised up Catholic like her husband and she stayed home. He goes to places where he is thrown out of and yet he finds humor in that.  It kind of shows us all the ignoranance of the human nature to need to know that there is a place they go and meet all their family who has gone before them. It somehow makes death not to be feared unless you are an evil person. Like I always said, "" _evil is Live spelled backwards as__ God is Dog spelled backwards.""  the stories they tossed out Bill shows you.  Yet due to that it makes the entire book a silly book that controls the masses and collect taxes and gives the holy ones power over the poor and working class keeping them poor and working or off to the land of NOD which is where the Jewish folks made their lives after being kicked out and far away from the NILE River. They had been attacked 3 times to prevent them from existing but they had a will to live and to this day they continue to fight and fuss over in a land in which they were placed smack dab in the middle of the area where their neighbors hate them. What was England and America thinking? I would have given them our desert and parts of Nevada an NM. it looks like their homeland and we could have brought their wailing wall with them, like we took the London Bridge now existing in AZ.  we could protect them so they did not have those horrible wars ..the Jewish people brought us humor through pain.

3487690,4,B001BAJSSI,"Like ""The God Who Wasn't There,"" I suspect that ""Religulous"" is Bill Maher's attempt to compensate for his religious upbringing and former belief. It is, however, a much better made and more amusing film. Maher goes for the easy targets of people who come across as mindless fanatics, to support his conclusion that these are the people steering the bus, as it were. We do meet a very interesting priest at the Vatican, who seems to embody the saying that the best way to become an atheist is to study religion deeply. We meet Orthodox Jews who attempt to devise electrical appliances that can be used on the Sabbath without violating it, a good-hearted but rather stupid Senator, Muslims on the edge of committing murder, the absurdities of Mormonism and Scientology, and at the Creationist Museum, the chilling and humorless Ken Ham. The rabbi who refused to recognize the Israeli state, denied the Holocaust, and was shown hugging Mahmoud Ahmedinejad (""let me finish!""), came across as mentally ill. Possibly a religious person would enjoy this film if they could fast-forward through the sections dealing with their particular religion. As someone who practices no religion at all, it was easy for me to laugh at the silly, ignorant believers. Maher's point is that the rest of us are letting these maniacs drive us toward an apolcalyptic showdown that could result in the end of all life on earth, and that by refusing to get involved, or by being a lukewarm member of one of these sects, we are all contributing to this eventuality.

Maher makes the mistake of thinking that because religion is used to explain the world to the ignorant, that is its only purpose. In fact, the main purpose of religion - the main reason it exists at all - is to encourage and facilitate group cohesion. The method it uses to accomplish this is by a common mythology, but this is the outcome, not the cause. In his warning of Armageddon, Maher provides quotes from Revelations and the Qur'an that seem to prophecy destruction. I'm not aware of an apocalypse in Islam that corresponds to the one some people believe is predicted in Revelations, and I wonder if Maher included the Qur'an quotes deliberately so he wouldn't be accused of picking exclusively on Christianity. But similar visions of the end of the world exist in many religions - the Norse Ragnarok or Gotterdammerung, the Buddhist ""sword interval,"" the Hindu Kalga, or the Hopi prophecies quoted at the end of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Koyaanisqatsi/dp/B00TT14YJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Koyaanisqatsi</a>&nbsp;that creepily evoke a nuclear device: ""A container of ashes might one day be thrown from the sky, which could burn the land and boil the oceans.""

Yet most people who believe this, don't really want it to happen, even if they think we are living in the ""end times"" or some such thing. Maher is not clear on what the rest of us need to do: should we actively suppress all religions? Or will they just disappear of their own accord? Maybe we just need to be aware that other people believe this. We've had the capability of destroying ourselves for a long time, and a religious war seems an unlikely excuse. In spite of the record of religiously-motivated bloodshed, only 17% of wars throughout history may be attributable to religion. It's far more plausible that World War Three will be fought over something fairly mundane, like water or habitable land. In that case, religion will be nothing more than a distraction.",1402790400,,3532,5.025597269624574

That would have brought some balance to this. Otherwise it just feels like picking on dumb people. That is not all that religion means at all. But it is funny and good entertainment.

It asks questions about the near psychotic delusions that are spun out of many churches and television evangelists who call themselves ""Doctor"" but are not real doctors.

3487722,3,B001BAJSSI,"This documentary is made by Curb Your Enthusiasm director Larry Charles and presenter and writer Bill Maher. Maher introduces himself by showing some footage of his stand-up comedy (reasonably funny observational humour) and by telling us about his mixed upbringing by a Roman Catholic father and Jewish mother. In common with many people, Maher's story is one of a childhood in Catholicism followed by an outright rejection of Christianity.

There's some touching footage with Maher's mother, who died shortly after filming, aged 88. Mrs Maher has a sharp sense of humour and gives an insight into Maher's experiences with religion. This introduction looks like it is going to set up a personal account, or a personal exploration by Maher, but then the crazies appear. People doused in blood, talking ""in tongues"", screaming and shouting, people from the oddball denominations and weird subsets.

It's an attempt to do a populist documentary, like those of Morgan Spurlock (Supersize Me) and Michael Moore (Bowling For Columbine), but where it fails is that there is no real structure.

We have interviews with uninformed people in a lorry converted into a chapel (the minister barely speaks). We might hope that this would progress to people with a greater insight into whatever question Maher is asking, but there is no plan. Interviewees seem to be random, half of people's answers are missed out, and the questions that are asked are not really helpful. Questions like ""How can smart people believe in the talking snake?"" are there for comedy purposes and not helpful. Certainly there must be a few people who believe in the talking snake, but this has to be a tiny minority. The minority like those fundamentalists we always hear about in the news who don't believe in dinosaurs. Having met some truckers he then meets a singer who is a televangelist
in interviewing him, he disingenuously puts ""after the fact"" subtitles over the man's answers.

More interviews follow. A ""monk"" on the street in Amsterdam, then an anti-gay protester and then a ""former gay"" man who now specialises in conversions to heterosexuality in the name of religion. We see orthodox Jews who cannot work on the Sabbath, but who have invented machines to do the work. Jews can operate the machines because their intervention interrupts the machine's work, thereby exploiting a loophole in the Torah. All very amusing, but what does it tell us?

He meets an ex-Jew for Jesus, and an American politician who wisely terminates the interview before he can embarrass himself too much.

One of the few bright sparks in the film is Father Reginald Foster, a Latinist and at the time a senior Vatican priest.

""Come on, roastin' in Hell? That's the old Catholic thing - that's all gone - that's all finished"" Foster explains amiably to Maher. If only Maher believed him and followed his exploration from there, he might have found out what normal Christians believed.

Holy Land tourists, an actor playing Jesus in a theme park, visitors to the theme park are all questioned. The only place Maher doesn't interview people is a church. Where are the ordinary vicars? The parishioners? The bishops? The mullahs and the rabbis? Where are the people who try to live good lives without starting holy wars, bashing gays, or claiming that evolution doesn't exist?

Much is made of the fact that elements of Jesus's story relating to his divinity are similar to those in other religions, but the obvious explanations are left out. This is first year religious studies material presented as though it's the Holy Grail.

Many interviewees are those who have either left their faiths or undergone radical conversions, making them atypical and fervent and therefore a bit odd. A former Mormon and a non-Zionist orthodox Jew, an ex-Moslem and former homosexual.

He then talks to a Puerto Rican in a bad suit who claims he is Jesus, and who apparently has 100,000 followers worldwide. A Moslem rapper, Dutch Islamic gay activists. We don't get to hear much of what some of these people say, we have to listen to Maher. The editing and how he doesn't listen to people answering questions he's just asked prevent us from hearing much of what they have to say.

The inter-cutting of old films doesn't serve to make it more exciting, it removes credibility from the film as a serious attempt to do anything and puts it into the realm of comedy. And certainly the film is funny. There's lot of nutcases on display, eccentrics and dimwits, and Maher himself is quite an amusing fellow. But it can't be a Louis Theroux-style documentary; something that we can learn from while being entertained. Instead, we learn lots of little chunks, mainly about fringe elements of various Christian denominations.

So the film is not without merit. But because it fails to be a structured documentary, it does seem like rather a waste of time.

Maher ends on a polemic that he could have started with. It appears that in one hour and forty minutes he has learned very little, and neither have we. ""You do not possess mental powers that I do not."" says Maher at one point. On the evidence of this film that claim could be disputed.

The commentary track is a revelation. It is a lot funnier than the actual movie and a lot more good-natured. Charles and Maher complain a few times that they didn't win an Oscar because the film is offensive and a threat. It isn't really offensive. It only threatens people who might be exposed in the eyes of their congregations as foolish. It didn't win at the Academy simply because it wasn't very good. But I look forward to seeing what more these two do, either together or individually.",1397001600,,5664,4.867082035306335

I guess I would just rather be safe than sorry so I continue to worship God out of fear that the obsurd just might be true. But this film is funny and thought provoking.

3487741,5,B001BAJSSI,"In his usual way, Bill Maher brings to light the political facts about religions of all kinds, while injecting humor to do so. This is a great DVD.  If you really watch and listen you will probably learn some things about the different religions out there that you may not have known before, as it seems Maher and his crew really did their research.  Maher includes humor to show the real and not so real things about religion in general, to help you decide for yourself and ""think"" about what some of these religions are truly like.
My belief in is that: Whatever YOU believe in,~ IF IT MAKES YOU A BETTER HUMAN BEING, then by all means you should claim it !!!  ~BUT if ""your religion or your God"" allows you to harbor ill thoughts or hatred of any kind toward any other human being for whatever reason, then IT IS NOT making you a better human being.  We are all humans living on one earth and we should do what our Mothers taught us first, to love one another and to share and share alike, for the good of everyone.
Wonderfully informative DVD.",1394064000,3,1047,4.3538461538461535
3487742,4,B001BAJSSI,"Two of the most vocal critics of modern organized religion at this writing in April 2012 have been the late Christopher Hitchens and Bill Maher. Hitchens was an intellectual and journalist who wrote a scholarly book called ""God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything"" in which he recounts recurring incidences of man's inhumanity to man in which religion was the basis. Bill Maher who is a political comedian rather than a journalist/scholar uses an irreverent comedy piece disguised as a documentary to make his point. Although most of the documentary is a completely irreverent and sometimes disrespectful look at religion, replete with old film footage and less-than-flattering photos, he begins his journey by reminding us that human beings are now capable of enacting Armageddon, not just God.

The documentary is relatively unstructured which is of course Maher's style. He visits evangelicals, ministers, rabbis, priests, politicians, even former Mormons in no particular order and pokes fun at the problem of literalism and fundamentalism. In these interviews, he asks questions about biblical inconsistencies, biblical myths, biblical immorality, and why ""faith"" is so important. A very wide range of answers are provided by the interviewees, although a recurring theme of circular logic is constantly offered by the evangelicals: ""We know God is real because the Bible tells me so, and the Bible is the Word of God."" Sort of the equivalent of ""George Washington couldn't lie about chopping down the cherry tree because he always told the truth.""

Although Maher's confrontations are aimed at a wide spectrum of religious and non-religious people, he does single out the Evangelical-Fundamentalists and the Mormons as prime targets, although he also takes a dab at Scientology as well. While at times, some of his interview style seems a bit disrespectful, I think there is an underlying message to his confrontations. Trying to reconcile the Bible as the perfect no-questions-asked document to history, science and morality is not only impossible, but shown to be a mixing of two entirely different ways of examining reality. Sort of like trying to find the square-root of a Da Vinci. However, the Fundamentalists for about the last century having been desperately trying to prove their interpretation of the Bible also reconciles with science, and therefore science is wrong if it comes to different conclusions. And therefore current understandings of science and history must be altered to fit with Scripture.

Theme parks and pseudo-science have become fundamentalist tools for dealing with arguments they can't win except to those who already sing in the choir. However, they have convinced themselves they can win theological arguments on rationalists grounds, and that's what I think Maher is trying to expose. One theme park centered on Creation shows dinosaurs and supposedly early humans living together. There's even a saddle on a triceratops! I believe Maher demonstrates that unquestioned belief in certain key areas are part of how particular American denominations are structured. He even talks about how the Mormons believe God lives on a particular planet!

This is Maher's entertaining means of exposing some of the silliness in terms of hard-core beliefs in religions. Two of my favorite moments are when a bona fide US Senator who admits there's no IQ test for getting a seat in the Senate when Maher asks whether he really believes there was a talking snake 5000 years ago. He then meets a rather maverick priest at the Vatican who admits frustration in regards to all the contradictions that the Bible and Doctrine pose. I don't think the documentary is meant to be taken too seriously, but I believe he wants the hard-core fundamentalists of all religions to take a moment, relax, breathe, and not take everything so seriously.",1394064000,,3867,5.252427184466019
3487743,5,B001BAJSSI,Fantastic Movie. I've watched it at least ten times and it makes me laugh every single time. Very good material as well!,1393891200,,120,4.5
3487754,1,B001BAJSSI,"Maher claims to abhor ""religion"", but the focus of his ridicule has always been Christianity.  He does blast Islam quite a bit, to be sure, though if you pay close attention you'll see that his criticism of Islam serves principally as a springboard for a yet more radical critique of Christianity, in which it suggested that Islamic terrorism represents merely the ultimate embodiment of a toxic archetypal religious mentality, held in common with Christians, in which the believer places his or her fanatical commitment to irrational religious precepts ahead of a basic sense of human dignity, thus leading to the seeming paradox of gross wickedness and cruelty in the name of God.  Were it not for the valiant resistance of courageous secularists like himself, or so the argument goes, the barbarities of state-empowered Christian fundamentalists could at length come to rival those of Middle East and North African imams.  Yet for all his pompous moralizing about the evils of organized religion, Maher, a self-identified Jew, is conspicuously reticent about making sport of the more serious peccadilloes of the religion of his own fellow Tribe members.  What makes this omission particularly hypocritical is that, while constantly preaching to the rest of humanity from atop its high horse of unimpeachable moral rectitude, Judaism, unlike Christianity and Islam, has the grand chutzpah to assert the racial superiority of one group of people (the Jews) to pretty much every one else in the world(Gentiles are ""supernal refuse"", according to the Talmudic sages), a pernicious doctrine that has been invoked even in our day by prominent representatives of the Jewish religion, as a basis for advocating genocide against Arabs, and particularly Palestinians, through their identification by rabbis with biblical ""Amalek"".  The sordid history of how this identification has played out in recent years in terms of the collective punishment and indiscriminate killing of Palestinian and Lebanese Arabs by Israel has been well documented and attested by many competent authorities.

Translated into the policies of an apartheid ethno-state of Israel that is strongly under the influence of a fanatical Rabinnate (whose influence permeates all aspects of Israeli life), it is not hard to see precisely why so much cruelty has been visited upon the Palestinians.  The reason for this conspicuous omission on the part of a supposedly equal opportunity critic of ""religion"" like Maher, is that he himself is a Jew, who, like many other Jews, feels both a fierce loyalty to Jews and Zionism and a strong loathing for everything Christian.  In this connection, so-called ""secularism"", with its facile anti-establishmentarian slogans and insistence on state-enforced irreligion (excepting, of course, the colossal Menorah planted on the White House lawn every December by a cadre of God's chosen), serves largely as an expedient pose for Jewish revilers of Christianity; a subterfuge of ethnic warfare masquerading as plain adherence to the lofty imperatives of Enlightenment.  Such banners offer tawdry ethnic haters like Maher the appearance of neutrality and reasoned criticism, whereas in fact their true motives hardly correspond to anything resembling the principled opposition to which they disingenuously pretend.  So we may observe that, in the end, the position of the Zionist Jew critic of ""religion"" boils down to a quite simple formula: withering intellectual skepticism and radical criticism for thee and thine, but unquestioning racial-religious apartheid and quasi-theocratic fascism for me and mine. To this, I can only echo the corrosive judgment of the greatest authority on Judaic moral philosophy hitherto reared, in saying: ye hypocrites!",1393632000,,3751,5.46286701208981
3487755,5,B001BAJSSI,"As another traveler on the path toward a better understanding of God I found this documentary to be an amazingly bold expose of the lunacy that passes for truth in this crazy world of ours. There is a God and it is clear to me that Bill and I are not him/her/it.

Bill argues that you figure it out for yourself and critically analyze the religion(s) that you currently accept at face value. Too many people fail to critically evaluate their beliefs in light of volumes of evidence to the contrary. This sad state of affairs is brilliantly presented by Bill as he wanders around talking to zealots of all manner who all believe fervently in diametrically opposed versions of God and are more than happy to express wonder and surprise that Bill does not think ""faith"" is an answer to the ultimate questions posed by our position in the universe. Bravo Bill. Maybe your likeness will someday be put in the mouth of the T-Rex at the fundamentalist museum as a way of showing how God's creatures deal with heretical non-believers (defined by each sect and religion differently) who dare to question............now that would go a long way to show their version of the world.",1393372800,,1170,4.679611650485437

I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised as it was very well done. He asked a lot of questions that made some people stop and think and some that brought out the fire of conviction in others. He did a fine job touching upon some non-Christian religions and I love when he was thrown out of the Vatican and ""Jesus' "" explanation of the Trinity.

Unfortunately, he fails to do so in this movie.  Instead of debating and crushing religious nutballs, he just sort of puts some odd people on display.

The movie could have been so much more.  There was a definite lack of creativity and drive behind this film, which not only makes the film a bit boring at times but also makes Maher's p.o.v. seem weaker than it is.  And it makes the comedy much less poignant.

It will offend the religious--but only just a bit.  It will entertain the reasonable--but only just a bit.

Worth watching as long as you can fast forward some parts.",1392249600,,721,4.666666666666667

3487775,4,B001BAJSSI,"This movie does provide for a good amount of comedy. But only if you're not insecure about your world views. I'll admit that before writing this review I read through most of the 1 and 2 star reviews, and the average reason is people for whom aren't secure about their belief structures. If your faith can't stand up to ""attack"" or rather some scrutiny perhaps you should take a look at yourself before judging.

Bill Maher is a former stand up comedian turned talkshow host. He's crass, uses clever editing, and isn't afraid to be blunt and talk over people. That's how he gets his comedy across. And he does a good job of it....unless you feel personally attacked(which really adds to the comedy for the rest of us). I don't. If you do, maybe you should take a look at the true history of your faith/religion and realize a few jabs here and there are pale in comparison. I don't think it's fair to say this movie won't convert anyone. Those waking up to reality usually need several injections of doubt and skepticism before that can happen. Who's to say this won't be that specific catalyst? If you already are atheist/agnostic this will mostly just make you chuckle and occasionally irritated, but that happens anyway.

I can't give it 5 stars, because there are funnier movies. It's not a documentary, so get that out of your heads right now. It's a movie I enjoyed watching and will watch again.",1391990400,,1401,4.6

In many cases it can keep people from taking responsibility for their own lives.  In some cases to the extreme by terrorists.  Mr Maher is downright rude and ""religulous"" in this movie.  There is no reason to belittle people for their beliefs.  Each of us chooses our belief system based on what feels right to the individual.  As long as a person's beliefs do not infringe on another's, and they bring comfort, who cares.  In this movie, Mr. Maher appears to deliberately set out to upset others whose belief system doesn't agree with his.

He roasts most major religions, except for Hinduism and Buddhism, so he's relatively balanced.  Four stars for this part of the movie.  In the last 5% of the film, however, Bill presents his own irrational belief.  He says that if the world were run by non-believers like him, it would be a more rational, peaceful place.

Let's test Bill's theory by looking at the first state in history to eliminate religion and replace it with atheism, the Soviet Union.  Vladimir Lenin, founder of the Soviet state, said:  ""Religion is the opium of the people  all modern religions and churches [are] used for the ... exploitation and the stupefaction of the working class.""  In other words, Lenin and Maher are on the same page, because they both believe religion makes you loopy.

As a result, the Soviet communist regime confiscated religious property, harassed believers, ridiculed religion, and propagated atheism in the schools. And no, I did NOT lift that from Mahers resume!

The Soviet state took all church property, and killed 28 bishops and 1,200 priests. Many more were persecuted and tortured. Perhaps they were forced to watch Bills movie, Religulous?

Subsequently, under the successor regime of Joseph Stalin, many more people died.  Most estimates range from 20 to 60 million. Methinks the rational atheist, Uncle Joe, was a tad more murderous than the Pope, but hey, Im not a genius / philosopher like Bill Maher!  Besides, I hear Stalin was a real crack-up at parties!

Another example: the Communist Party of Cambodia, known as the Khmer Rouge and led by the atheist Pol Pot, attempted agricultural reforms which led to widespread famine and death. Whoops, those crazy Commies!

Arbitrary executions and torture carried out by the Khmer Rouge are considered to be genocide.  As Bill Maher himself might have quipped at the time, Hey, Pol Potty baby, you're killin me man, you're killin me!

Other atheistic regimes, for example Communist China and North Korea, have similar records. Recent history clearly demonstrates the ridiculousness of Bill's lame, liberal, anti-religious theory.  He deserves the same ridicule that he dishes out to others.  Dennis Prager, a religious Jew and conservative talk radio host, summed it up nicely: what really matters is not people's beliefs, but their behaviors.  Amen!",1385596800,,2458,5.138539042821159

I do appreciate Maher's very clear and thoughtful approach, challenging those who do not wish to be challenged.

It is worth the watch, however as he baits and spars with different people about their religious beliefs. It reveals much about both sides. Some good footage with him, his mother and sister.",1520812800,,297,4.622641509433962
