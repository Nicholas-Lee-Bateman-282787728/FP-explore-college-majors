5944029,5,B00EUDRUU6,"Octonauts is a show that my kids have watched since the show first started.  It is an adorable show about a team of animals who help out other animals in the ocean, its a fun animated show that teaches great lessons.  From little facts about animals to the theme of working together to solve problems, the show is wholesome and perfect for preschoolers.

This DVD features six fun episodes featuring all different animals and my kids love them all.  Yes they are episodes that have previously aired on TV, so don't think they are new ones.  My kids didn't mind that they have seen the episodes before, they were thrilled to have the episodes on hand to watch anytime.  The episodes are easy to follow and ones that all three of my kids (2, 5 and 6 years old) could follow.  I admit as well I don't mind watching this DVD along with my kids.

I received this DVD to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",1389484800,3,914,4.398809523809524
5944030,3,B00EUDRUU6,"Such a disappointment, do no buy if you gave disney DVr,  all repeats.  I though we were getting some new ones.  Was on a wait list for about a month.  Major disappointment for me and my two year old. Bummer",1389312000,2,207,4.1
5944031,5,B00EUDRUU6,"The 411 by Maria:

What an adorable show. My kids are a little older and we don't watch as much TV as we did when they were toddlers together but I know they would have been obsessed with this show.

This DVD contains 6 full episodes including:

Sea Snakes

Adelie Penguins

Colossal Squid

Walrus Chief

Electric Torpedo Ray

Crab and Urchin

It is fun, educational and colorful teaching children and adults about marine life while the Octonauts explore the deep ocean in their fun, slide filled sea ship.

My favorite episode on this DVD was the Crab and Urchin. The urchin and crab are adorable as they work together in symbiosis (""where two creatures work together because they need each other for different reasons""). The Octonauts at first believe they have find a creature that is half sea urchin, half crab until Dr. Shellington explains to Captain Barnacles how the creatures benefit each other.

The voices for the urchin and crab were hysterical, they argue because they don't appreciate each other and it is up to the Octonauts to stop the constant yelling and make them see why they need each other.

This is an adorable CGI show and can be seen on Disney Junior. Check your cable listing for times.",1389312000,,1212,4.691943127962086
5944032,1,B00EUDRUU6,"My 22 year old grandsone LOVES Octonauts, so when it became available for Region 1 DVD we jumped on it. I am so disappointed in it. There are 6 epidsodes on the DVD...but they are run together. There is no theme/starting sequence before each one...and no creature report after each one. The creature reports are a separate choice...sooo not buying the next DVD....",1389312000,,364,4.7936507936507935
5944033,5,B00EUDRUU6,"My son has watched Octonauts a few times while visiting family (we don't have cable).  He loves watching this show.  Last time we went to the store he begged me for an Octonauts toy.  I can often hear him playing and saying ""Octonauts, to the HQ.""  I love the lessons he is learning and that he likes to repeat names and words (he has some speech delays and receives therapy for it so repeating things give him great practice).",1389139200,,427,4.367088607594937
5944034,4,B00EUDRUU6,"This was our first experience with the Octonauts- and we were pleasantly surprised by this movie. My daughter was immediately curious after I started it- asking me who is that mama, since the show was completely new to her. We talked about how it is a show about animals in the sea, and friends who go to look for them. She was interested enough to keep watching at that point and we had a great experience watching together. Our favorite part was when they sing creature report"" at eh end of the episode, a song that recaps the events of the episode. My little one LOVES songs when watching shows, and this is her favorite part of each show. This is a great movie for a three year old as the episodes are informative without being too wordy which is sometimes a big problem when it comes to educational childrens TV. She loves that it is still an exciting adventure and I love that she is learning as she goes! We will be sure to keep watching!",1389052800,,945,4.344632768361582
5944035,5,B00EUDRUU6,"I began watching the Octonauts on PBS last year with my grandchildren. It was perfect for Zeke, age 4 and his brother, Ben age 2.  The adventures were educational and entertaining. Then I found this DVD which comprised 6 of their episodes from the PBS series. It was great to be able to own part of the magic and share it whenever we wanted with this DVD.

 Of the six adventures on this DVD we liked the Sea Snakes episode the best. These Octonauts manage to present a story with suspense and excitement without any traditional bad guys.  These sea snakes are dangerous but respond to the Octonauts care with some cooperation. But the Electronic Torpedo Ray is also shocking and delightful. The stuffy, puffed up Walrus Chief is hilarious as he harbors Peso's medical kit. My grandchildren are learning with each adventure.

We also like the funny characters in the Octonauts.  The mischievous 4 year old relates well to Quazi the Cat Pirate character, the more mellow 2 year old watches Peso the Penguin as he carefully bandages a flipper. We both like his expression of anger and concern, Flippity Flippers.

Each episode introduces a new undersea creature to the children. And the Creature Report at the end provides a summary of the creatures activities. This exciting dance segment ends with an actual picture of the undersea creature. Its great to see them in a real environment.

Id give this Octonauts collection 5 out of 5 stars. One to be watched over and over.
Id recommend for children 2 year to 5 years of age.",1388102400,9,1524,4.703007518796992

The one downside that we saw was that the Creature Reports are an extra feature on the DVD rather than appearing at the end of each episode. My son loves the episodes, but he gets really excited when the Creature Reports come on and to not have that after each one was disappointing. I would still recommend this.
