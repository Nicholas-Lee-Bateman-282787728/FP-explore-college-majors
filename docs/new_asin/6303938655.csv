7858728,4,6303938655,"This is one of my favorites from the OAV series. This one has the 3rd Ranma 1/2 Theatre release in it and just it also has some of the Japanese version openers at the end of the tape.
Episode 1, Team Ranma vs The Legendary Phoenix, after Kuno purchases a mysterious egg that is said to be the egg of the mystical fiery bird, Phoenix, trouble ensues when the main rule is broken, ""NEVER PUT THE FOOL THING ON YOUR HEAD"". Now Kuno and the ""mystical"" Phoenix are running loose. It's up to Ranma, Ryoga, Akane, Sasuke, Ukyo and Shampoo to defeat Kuno and the Phoenix.
Episode 2, The Tunnel of Lost Love, this is another one of the ghost story episodes (like the ones in the HARD BATTLE series).  After Shampoo and Ukyo find out about a haunted cave that is said to break up couples, they get a great idea and bring Akane and Ranma together in hopes that the legend is true. But Ranma and Akane aren't on their own because the whole gane (Soun, Genma, Mousse, Kuno, Ryoga, Sasuke, Kasumi, Cologne, Nabiki and Kodachi) are right behind them for this trail of terror and fun.
This tape is hilarious! The 1st episode is a classic and the 2nd episode was one of the only good ghost stories that they have done and it's really funny as well. Plus the music videos at the end are pretty good as well and sung by the Japanese language version acresses of the girls.
Definately worth picking up. 4 1/2 well deserved stars and also check out the rest of the OAB series like FASTER KASUMI KILL KILL, DESPERATELY SEEKING SHAMPOO and LIKE WATER FOR RANMA.",1046736000,,1538,4.3776223776223775
7858729,5,6303938655,"Ranma 1/2 rocks! This OAV was really funny, I've seen it lots of times! I like the end of it and I am happy that Ryouga was in it! I feel sorry for him, poor lost guy. He is SO cool! This OAv has many quotable quotes that my friends ( we're all otaku)and I say all the time. I have so many books and shows and songs memorized! Major obessesion! Oh well. (Yappa Yappa e-shanten!) Sayonara!",1040774400,,388,4.0519480519480515
7858730,5,6303938655,"I've seen both movies, every OAV, and every single Ranma 1/2 video from season 1 to the 6th video in season four, and I say this is one of the best. In the first episode, Kuno buys a phoenix egg from a man that keeps saying, ""...not that I believe in it, mind you,"" the whole time. He doesn't want to sell the egg, but when Kuno slaps him with a wad of bills, he accepts. He did warn Kuno that no matter what he did he must not place the egg on his head. Kuno tells Satsuke that there is no fool around that would do that - then Ranma shows up. He hits Kuno with a baseball, and the egg drops. Ranma catches it, and places it on Kuno's head. The egg hatches....to become this fat ugly yellow thing!! What a surprise to Kuno. Ranma was a little shocked as well, and was looking right at the phoenix's face. When it opened it's eyes, the first thing it saw was Ranma, and started to peck him like crazy. Once at the Tendo household, the Tendos, Ranma and Genma, Kuno, Satsuke, and the man who sold Kuno the egg sat down at the table and talked about the phoenix - while it was still going at Ranma, who was sitting next to Kuno. When the man tells them that the bird will leave the nest on its own - which would be in 100 years, Mr. Tendo sends Kuno and Ranma outside to live in a tent - ""Don't come back until the bird leaves the nest!"" Akane feels bad for Ranma, and brings him food in the morning. when she opens the flap of the tent, she sees him and Kuno are still sleeping, but the phoenix opens its eyes, looks straight at Akane, and starts after her. Kuno and Ranma wake up, Akane is running around the neighbor-hood with Kuno and the bird chasing her. Ranma saves her and stops the bird and Kuno. So basically what happens next is Satsuke tricks Ukyo and Shampoo into making growth pills to speed up the phoenix's growth process. I'm not going to tell you any more. You'll have to watch it and find out for yourself.
  In ""The Tunnel Of Lost Love,"" Shampoo and Ukyo are looking for places to go on a trip when Shampoo's great-grandmother picks up one of the many magazines on the table, and finds a place where couples break up. Ukyo and Shampoo grab the magazine and both shout ""It's perfect!"" everyone arrives at the tunnel of lost love - a scary, creepy place with ghosts and ghouls and other really creepy things inside. everyone has to pair up, though. Ukyo and shampoo push Akane and Ranma forward, telling them to go together (their plan being to break them up). Shampoo takes Mousse, Kasumi and Mr. Tendo go (because they have no one else to go with), Ryoga shows up and Ukyo takes him, Kuno and Nabiki go together (Kuno had to pay for her, of course), Kodachi and Satsuke go (no one knows that they're there), Ranma and Akane go, and finally Genma and the great-grandmother go. Really creepy stuff happens, Ukyo and Shampoo try to break up Akane and Ranma, Kodachi interferes...do they get to the end of the tunnel? See for yourself!",1034812800,,2949,4.254901960784314
7858731,5,6303938655,The second episode on this tape is pretty goood. the only bad thing I have to say about it is that it shares the same tape as the first episode. The first episode on the tape made me laugh so hard I started crying. This  episode is worth the price of the tape alone. Brief nudity but no real  questionable content. After both episodes are over there are several music  videos at the end of the tape. Very cool.,949795200,,410,4.1645569620253164
7858732,4,6303938655,"The anime that has fun with water!  Of course, being that it is Ranma, this OAV was hilarious.
One thing though........The second episode was in the shadow of the first.  The first episode made me laugh so hard, I fell  off the couch.  The second was pretty bland, and the storyline could have  been a lot better.  But overall, it is soooo worth it.  Who wouldn't want  to see Ryouga get splashed with hot and cold water after another?",949104000,,435,4.417721518987341
