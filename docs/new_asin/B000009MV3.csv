7905529,2,B000009MV3,"VAMPIRE FAMILY (1993) is a mild Hong Kong take-off on the Addams Family films (with touches of ""The Munsters""), focusing on an eccentric family of modern-day Hong Kong vampires, whose number includes a grandfather who sleeps in a coffin. The family butler was once a dog who still feels the urge to sniff, lick and scratch himself on a regular basis.
Handsome young David Vamp (Jimmy Lin), seemingly the most normal member of the family, is an intern at a local hospital who falls in love with Julie May (Athena Chu), a kitchen worker there, but hesitates to act because of his vampire heritage. David has a sexy sister, Tong, who hooks up with David's love-starved intern buddy and has no intention of letting her vampire heritage interfere. Their combined romantic misadventures fuel the film's freewheeling storyline. Eventually a family secret helps smooth the course of true love for David and Julie May.
Stealing the show is Hong Kong comic actress Sandra Ng who plays the slinky black-clad vampire mama very much in the Morticia vein and vamps in high style throughout. Comedy star Eric Tsang (a Chinese Lou Costello look-alike) directed the film and co-stars as the vampire dad. Onetime Kung fu star Leung Kar Yan appears as the vampire grandfather (the one who sleeps in a coffin). Though it's not nearly as funny as its Hollywood counterparts, fans of HK comedy will find VAMPIRE FAMILY charming, although it may be a tough sell to others.",989539200,,1449,4.870445344129554
