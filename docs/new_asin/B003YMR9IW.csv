This movie hasn't yet gained the momentum that movies like, ""Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead"", or ""Forks Over Knives"", have.
But given more time, I have no doubt that it will only help to increase the ""whole foods"" movement.",1513641600,,437,4.891891891891892

8409688,5,B003YMR9IW,"Localvore was a wonderfully put together documentary. It took a real in depth approach to the local food, and well worth the watch.",1366848000,2,131,4.739130434782608
8409689,5,B003YMR9IW,"Locavore, the movie, is truly a local production.  You won't find any big name ""Foodie"" celebrities in this production - they're not needed.  The Living Farm's Lynn Gillespie plus Jay Canode use local talent to describe what a locavore is all about.

Locavore is positive - it does not go into the graphic details of industrial agriculture issues.  Other documentaries have gone that route to raise awareness.  Locavore, on the other hand, is more instructive.  Instructive in the sense that the movie makers let the locals themselves tell the locavore story.  The movie includes a number of anecdotes from locals who convince the audience with sincerity the benefits of eating locally in terms of physical and community economic health.

For me, the most important part of the movie is the ""How to..."" section towards the end.  Here, Lynn demonstrates how to create earth and cinder block gardens, and Jay uses time lapse photography to show how such gardens can be created from start to finish.  Also, Jay provides resources to get more information regarding the local food movement.

One day at a local farmers market where we had the movie for sale, a lady came up and mentioned that Locavore changed her family members' lives.  They all became locavores as a result of viewing the movie.  As the Slow Food Western Slope chapter leader, that was music to my ears. Plus, that's the biggest compliment a movie can get.",1287878400,7,1420,4.891213389121339
