But the film has a solid script, fine acting, terrific choreography and songs, and is not at all embarrassing to anyone if that generation. Especially good are the leads, Kennedy and McDonald. For the most part the film is a family-oriented (except for a false 'topless' breastplate that may shock then amuse) tale of ambition and the strength of family bonds; this is a great afternoon's entertainment.",1403481600,,484,4.987654320987654

697595,5,6303544584,An excellent 2 DVD set of this wonderful 1982 musical. The story about a young girl seeking fame takes a back seat to Jo Kennedy's sparkling performance. Ross O'Donovan as her enterprising cousin shines no less brightly! Great songs from Split Enz alumni Phil Judd & Tim Finn add to the celebration.

697599,5,6303544584,"I saw this when it first came out, and the songs (especially ""Monkey in Me"" have stuck with me all these years.  I bought it recently and showed it to my husband and sons (12 and 14); they all liked it, and when it was over, they replayed all of the songs.  ""Body and Soul"", ""I want to live in a house"", and ""Monkey in Me"" were particular favorites.  A few weeks after seeing it, my sons are still occasionally singing ""I want to live in a house""

I was very pleased at how well the movie has held up.  The adult actors are very good, much of the dialog is clever and funny, and the younger actors, if sometimes too obviously ""acting"", are immensely likeable.  Jo Kennedy really shines in the musical numbers - her singing and stage presence are excellent, as are the music and choreography.

I bought the two-disc special edition, and the picture and sound qualitly are fine.  We haven't viewed the extras (other than the isolated musical numbers.",1366761600,2,948,4.4393063583815024

I just wished the DVD was better. This one is 4x3, full-frame. Boo. Nonetheless, I love this movie. I think it's hilarious.

697691,5,6303544584,"When I was 16 years old and this movie was in actual movie theaters, I wanted nothing so much as to be Jo Kennedy, starring in this film as Jackie Mullins.  But although I can pull off the red hair and the kangaroo suit, I am not a performer at heart.  However, this movie makes me remember how much fun it was to be young and crazy.  This was a really fun movie.  Especially if you're a fan of the Split Enz. It's the best of the 80's and while I don't exactly mourn for my lost youth - I do enjoy being reminded of who and what I valued in my teens.",1237852800,,551,3.849557522123894
697692,4,6303544584,"I first saw this movie in the early 1980s when it was new.  I just saw it again last night.  It still has a quaint charm about it even though the music is quite dated.  The movie reminds me of real Australian music from this era, Devo and Men at Work.  It's their version of techno-rock but it still has somewhat of an appeal to me.

Jackie and her ever optimistic younger cousin, Angus, will do just about anything to achieve a level of stardom.  Eventually they take over an amateur talent show and win $25K which we presume is enough to save the family business.  The storyline is relatively weak, but its a musical.  Nobody realy seems to be hopelessly miscastand the movie proceeds at a steady pace.

It may be another 25 years before I see it again (or will want to) but that's fine by me.  Who knows, it may still have some charm in another quarter century.",1237420800,,864,4.3105590062111805

But I would wager that even the cast and crew thought they were going to see the 1982 Australian movie ""Starstruck"" which has a cult following.  In fact, just about every movie ever made has a cult following, except for this one.  Don't ask me why this very entertaining comedy is so utterly forgotten.  It shouldn't be.  If you are interested in the movie business, like Jamie Kennedy or just want to see an old fashioned movie, then you should see this.  It's really very, very good.  Unfortunately, as George Gordon Flynn would say, that doesn't mean much in Hollywood.",1198281600,,639,4.584070796460177

In a world of stupid musicals with non-songs in them, Miss Saigon, Phantom, Hairspray (boy did they blow a chance to write some terrific new music), this little movie from the 80's just jumps out at you.

Every songs a winner, you actually can sing them.  The actings good, the plotlines fun.

697695,5,6303544584,"I've always considered ""Starstruck"" the Holy Grail of eighties flicks (okay with exception of ""Dogs in Space"" and ""Breaking Glass""). If there ever was a film that could jam pack the 80's in like a sardine can then this musical is it. Big, feathered pink and red hair, skinny ties, ratted hair, fishnets, creepers, ballerina tutus, crinolines, legwarmers, and last but not least, the Lizard Lounge. Gillian Armstrong's arty farty world of Aussie new wavers comes to life with kick ass music and visuals that resemble a Cyndi Lauper video high on Red Hots.

Indomitable Jackie Mullins and the Wombats try their hand at winning the $25,000 purse in a battle of the bands contest to help save her mum's pub. But actually getting into the contest in the first place might prove to be the biggest obstacle of all. Toss in her scheming brother Angus, some well-placed high jinx, and an infectious heroine who only wants to sing ala non-conformist style come together in an amazingly uplifting crescendo of music and feel-good enterprising entertainment. One of my all time favorite flicks!",1185667200,2,1082,4.945054945054945

697697,5,6303544584,"Starstruck is one of the great forgotten flicks of the 80s.

Its name should be uttered with quiet reverence in the same breath as Valley Girl, Sixteen Candles, and the Breakfast Club, but - sadly - namedrop the film in North America, and you're likely to get a resounding ""Huh?,"" even among 80s aficionados.

I've probably watched my old, decrepit VHS of this movie about 100 times over the last 20 years, and the thing that's always brought me back for more is how the sincerity and quirkiness of the family scenes plays against the spirited and energetic new wave musical numbers - sure, they're amateurish by today's standards, but the complete conviction and enthusiasm with which they're executed is a giddy (not guilty!) pleasure.

The song highlights here are many, but my personal favorites are ""Body and Soul,"" the Split Enz song from the band's best CD, Frenzy, and the irrepressible ""I Want to Live in a House,"" which lays bare the link between punk rebellion and nerdy frustration; Ross O'Donovan and his merry band of misfits ""oi, oi, oi"" their way through a sarcastic and convincing rave up with more nervous energy than an early Elvis Costello video; if you don't have goosebumps by the key change, or you don't immediatlely watch it again, congratulations: you're clinically dead.

The DVD is a huge improvement on the VHS edition. It's great to finally see the film in all its widescreen glory with much-improved sound and picture quality. I was a bit worried that part of the film's charm lay in the nostalgia of watching it on washed-out videotape, but that's definitely not the case. The greatest sin of the VHS edition, as it turns out, was that it obsured the fantastic production design. I must've paused the DVD 15 or 20 times last night to take a closer look at the background. Bravo!

The extras are interesting, but -- where are the interviews with Jo Kennedy and Ross O'Donovan? It's impossible to watch this film without wanting to find out more about both of them. As Gillian Armstrong notes in the extras, O'Donovan was 17 when he made the film (playing a 14 year old), which would make him 41 today. How does he feel about the film and his performance today? An expanded edition, please.

The discussion with screenwriter Stephen MacLean is interesting, in that he doesn't seem to like the film very much; ahh, the classic grouchy screenwriter who wanted to direct his own work! He cultivates the image, as he's interviewed on the beach getting a leg massage.

Interestingly, MacLean says that he thinks O'Donovan's performance is weak(!), and he wishes he could've chosen the songs himself. He also recalls a time he saw the film in a theatre and found himself sitting next to a six-year-old girl, who attempts to explain what's going on to her two-year-old sister. Good stuff.

All the interviewees say the film did better in the U.S. than Australia, which is hard to believe. However, I do recall Siskel and Ebert giving Starstruck two thumbs up, so that might've done the trick (hey, it worked for My Dinner with Andre).

The deleted scenes aren't so great; they're mostly extended scenes, and by ""extended"" I'm using the term liberally -- they're about five seconds longer than the originals.

I join the (building?) chorus of fans demanding a CD of the music; and, while we're at it, why don't we also demand the DVD release of Modern Girls, the other great forgotten 80s flick (notable for featuring Depeche Mode's should-have-been-a-hit But Not Tonight)?",1172620800,7,3495,4.81

697699,1,6303544584,"I saw this film in my teens and couldn't believe just how bad it was. Now in my 40's, it's a stunner of a bad film that belongs right up there with the Golan-Globus musical disaster ""The Apple"". Every musical number is jaw-dropping bad. This film is a product of the 80's and should have remained there.",1165968000,3,303,4.333333333333333

697771,3,6303544584,"This after tv special from the early 80's deals with the age old issue of practicalness over artistic ambition. Trini Alvarado stars as an aspiring folk singer. Her mother is dead set against this as she has her heart set on Trini being a bookkeeper. When a scholarship is offered, Trini has to make up her mind over her future.
Trini does a believable job acting but the songs aren't really that good. In a way though that makes the special more real. While this isn't the best of the after school specials (""It Must Be Love Cause I Feel So Dumb"" and ""Mom and Dad can't hear me"" come to mind) it is worth tracking down.",1153008000,,620,4.3076923076923075
697772,5,6303544584,"This is a great movie for those days when you need a pick me up. The acting is over the top but in this case and movie it works as they come off as larger then life. The scenes in the movie and the set design are surreal and over the top, so the actors made their characters larger then life and surreal and this is a very good thing as it allows the whole film to blend. The world this movie takes place in and the type of people it has living in it do not actually exist, but those of us that love this movie sure wish they did. The music choice could not have been better for this film.

If you listen to the commentary during the movie you will hear the director lammenting about how INXS was one of the bands possible for the movie and they instead went with the Swingers, with the future leads of Crowded House and Phil Judd. Thank god they went with the Swingers, their music style matches the entire rest of the movie to a tee. Had INXS been the band they used the whole movies feel would have suffered. The music in this is one of the major keys to its success and I find it funny that the director has missed this point. She should be thankful they went with the Swingers, otherwise this movie would be long forgotten. Phil Judd is a extremely quirky guy, and his screen persona matched this surreal movie very well along with his phenomenal mix of pop classics. The songs on this movie such as Monkey in Me, Body and Soul, Starstruck, One Good Reason (which can be found on ""Counting the Beat"" a Swingers CD that was recently available on Amazon), I want to live in a Box.

This movie came together as good as possible, despite the director. Thank god we cannot go back, and it seems that hindsite may not always be 20/20.

Now what do we need? THE SOUNDTRACK! Seriously, there is not a bad track on this whole movie, some of the best songs ever made, I would say the best the Swingers ever produced are actually on this movie instead of on their CD's. I really really hope the soundtrack is finally put onto CD. I got my $20 ready. This is the only movie I have ever attempted to record via a microphone and my TV's speakers, it did not work so well. This movie really needs a soundtrack release on CD.",1141430400,8,2214,4.180327868852459
697773,5,6303544584,"I saw this wonderful little movie in the theater during its first run in NYC with a group of Aussie friends. And promptly went back and saw it again the following day. I fell in love with the corny plot - we've got to put on a show to save the pub! Went out and bought the cassette soundtrack because the New Wave pop songs are great - memorable, bouncy, sing-able, and delivered with gusto. It's a charming film that can be watched over and over again. One of the great movie musicals. If you like the slightly wacky slant on the world from Oz, Gillian Armstrong's films, early '80's New Wave power pop, take a chance on Starstruck. You won't regret it!",1134691200,3,654,4.32520325203252
697774,4,6303544584,"I first saw this film many years ago when it first came to my city.  I had been told it was the Australian Fame.  Well, that description does it a great injustice.  This is not a simple Aussie version of an American film, but a unique twist on some old standards that seems as fresh on this DVD as it do all those years ago when I saw it on the big screen.

This is the story of Jackie Mullens who has a dream of being a singer.  She has talent but needs a break.  Her 14-year-old cousin Angus acts as her agent and sets up the stunts that get her a chance at the fame she seeks.  The road is rocky with all sorts of roadblocks and detours including family, work, sexual orientations and just getting where she needs to be.

At more than twenty-years-old this film remains fresh in ways other simply can not.  Musical numbers pay tribute to many styles from the opening which might remind viewers of films like David Bowie's Absolute Beginners to a number that feels like an Annette and Frankie beach number even though it is in a pub.  Plenty of good extras round out the two disks in this set.",1133222400,2,1095,4.221153846153846
697775,5,6303544584,"This movie was finally re-released (summer of 2005) on a new two-disc DVD collection with the ""extras"" it deserves -- interviews with the producer, director, screenwriter; an audio commentary track; and deleted and extended scenes. More importantly, the sound and picture quality on this DVD release are light years ahead of the previous releases that were in the US (both of which I've previously purchased but gave up watching half-way through because the quality was so horrible). In short, the picture looks great, and the sound does the music justice. If you're a fan of Australian cinema in general...or movie musicals...or just want to see an Australian take on movie musicals in  (roughly) the same era that  the US was putting out ""Grease"" -- this is definitely worth seeing.

Also,  if you're a fan of the movie or of director Gillian Armstrong, you'll enjoy the interviews. Gillian Armstrong talks somewhat wistfully about how she rejected two other ""unknown"" bands to do the soundtrack (INXS and Men at Work), both of whom went on to be huge hits in America about 6 months after the movie opened to modest business in the US. As she notes in her interview, this movie probably never really caught on with the teen audience in the US because ""they don't go to foreign movies"" and ""at the time they couldn't imagine that there was any new wave music in Australia.""

The audio commentary from the producer is an interesting insight on the movie-making business; he spends a lot of his time explaining what it took to get a movie made in Australia at the time (e.g., fund-raising from investors was driven by a mix of government funding and favorable tax laws for investors), and how it affected the creative process. Very different from most of the audio commentary tracks on the other movies.

All in all, a lot of fun.",1126051200,15,1829,4.79047619047619
697776,4,6303544584,"First of all, this is a musical about making it as a pop musician. To like this movie, you'll have to like the music. It's mostly pop-rock with female lead vocals. If you're exclusively into heavy metal, rap or classical, this is not for you. The soundtrack is a collection/collaboration of several different performers and writers, notably including Tim Finn (of Split Enz, Crowded House & The Finn Brothers).

Second of all, this is from Australia, which seems to me sort of like an odd parallel dimension of the 1980s U.S. in the movie. If you don't like Australia or Australian accents, forget it. As for me, I've always found that country strangely fascinating - altho I've never been.

I first became aware of this movie waaay back in the early/mid 80's when VH1 was just starting out. In those days they were kind of quirky and uncommercial and often played the TV video version of ""Monkey In Me"" - which was fantastic (not quite the same in the movie, unfortunately). I then got the vinyl LP and was surprised at how consistently good the music was. Somehow the movie managed to get reviewed by Siskel & Ebert (2 thumbs up). After all that I decided I had to see the video and managed to rent a copy - not that easy.

Frankly, I found the movie a bit uneven, but generally interesting and entertaining. The plot is fairly simple and derivative, but the music, performers and setting combine to make the finished product seem fresh and unique.  I won't give away any details, but suffice it to say, it does keep your attention. Part of the reason I enjoyed it is due to the fact that, for some reason - as MTV found out long ago - it's nice to have a visual to go along with music. While I did like the film, it didn't really seem to live up the high quality of the music. It's almost a case of a soundtrack with a movie attached.  Still, the total package is good enough to rate 4 stars in my book.

If I could rate the soundtrack alone, I'd give it 5 stars. Despite the hassle of converting vinyl to clean MP3s, I did it for EVERY track on the album. (Don't bother looking for a CD of the soundtrack - it doesn't exist.) You may want to buy the DVD just to have a clean version of the music - altho some pieces are cut up and talked over somewhat.

Despite the catchy music and the good reviews, this movie has always suffered in obscurity. I don't think it was much of a hit even in its native country. I guess the story behind the story of this movie is that if you really want to make a name for yourself, you don't want to stay in Australia (kind of like my home town). Other than Tim Finn, I'm not aware of anyone associated with this good movie and great soundtrack going on to bigger things....

P.S. ""Monkey In Me"" IMHO is one of the best pop/rock songs ever done. It may be the best song you've never heard.",1125619200,,2825,4.296992481203008
697777,5,6303544584,"How wonderful to see this upbeat gem of an Aussie musical comedy back in print and selling on the racks at major outlets. The plot is ironically traditional (showing the parallel between late 70's early 80's inspirational film to Depression-era counterparts) yet full of original characters, terrific New Wave-style music, and genuine energy.

Rather than being campy or dated, the film still has legs--it's a great musical by any standard--and, if anything, it'll make more than a few nostalgic for a kind of nifty time. Expect colored hair, too much makeup, and crazy clothes (but no tattoos or piercings--considered anti-social and hostile by that charming crowd back then), expect danceable, hooky music by Australia's best (including a sample of the old Split Enz crowd) and expect a lot of fun. This is exactly the kind of movie needed for these scary and too-earnest times. Your kids will love this film to pieces!

I'm happy to see that there is someone else out there who was just as eager as I was to get their hands on this DVD!

I saw this movie four times in the theatres, back in '83, in its initial USA release. It was one of those exceptional films that really stuck with me. I found a VHS copy later in the 80s and was happy with that for a many years. I never saw any other DVD versions for sale, so I was very excited to see that this release was coming out.

If you are a fan of this film, you will be very gratified to see this DVD! The quality is wonderful. By the climactic end of the story, I was in tears - of pure joy! There were so many details I was never able to see before - it's a beautiful print of the film. The music sounds fantastic - truly amazing from start to finish!

If you have never seen this film, it is a pearl! And this new DVD edition brings it all across clean and clear. Put it on, crank up the sound and get ready for a rocking good time!

Especially interesting was the interview with Armstrong and Elfick! This was not an easy film for them to make. Hearing the stories behind the making of the film and its music only served to enhance my enjoyment of the movie.

INCREDIBLE! I NEVER thought this film would look or sound so AMAZING. Fans of this little known gem will wet themselves with joy. The WIDESCREEN pic is clean. The sound is balanced. The extras seem to be the same (minus a few) from the R4 disc, which were/are FAB.

I especially love ""I Want to Live in House"" done by Angus and the Wombats, not to mention the song from crashing the Sydney Opera House ""Monkey in Me"". If you like irreverent humor and 80s semi-punk music as well, this movie is for you. The soundtrack for this movie (although hard to find) is also well worth the price if you can find it as well.

12/21/10:  Just checking in on my more or less annual rant.  What do we want?  Starstruck soundtrack on CD or MP3! When do we want it?  NOW!

08/13/12:  Come on iTunes!!  Surely someone can acquire the rights to this soundtrack and make it available to people like me who are still in love with ""Starstruck"" after all these years.

08/11/2014:  I still want a better copy of the soundtrack.  What's a girl gotta do to get a quality copy of the Starstruck soundtrack? :)

01/03/2015: My annual viewing of the crashing of the Sydney Opera House reminds me that the soundtrack is missing one of my favorite songs from the film, Surfside Tango (Angus' attempt to make the world dance).  Since the soundtrack is not likely to be released on iTunes anytime soon - or anytime at all, I am doing the next best thing...I'm going to Sydney to visit filming locations of one of my favorite films.  I wonder if Angus and The Wombats could arrange a performance of ""I Want to Live in a House"" for me?  :)

07/05/2015:  Is it wrong that I felt compelled to search out this place while in Sydney?  Of course, the inside looks different, but I was still excited to hunt it down.",1091577600,41,2612,4.506410256410256
697857,5,6303544584,"I absolutely love this movie.  It shows that if you're clever enough and have enough tenacity (not to mention talent) that you really can ""make it"".  The Swingers were fantastic!  For me, they were a stand-out in the film.  The soundtrack is awesome.  The only thing I would love to have changed about this movie is the sound quality with some of the dialogue.  At times it's hard to hear what's being said.
I hope this will be released on DVD in the US one day.",1032998400,,462,4.313953488372093
697858,5,6303544584,"One of my all-time favorite films. Silly, over-the-top, but absolutely delightful. The water ballet doubles me up every time. The characters are endearing and enterprising--you'll cheer for them and for the gorgeous scenes at the Sydney Opera House. Infectious music will have you humming long afterwards, and might even inspire you to get a parrot for your shoulder.",1021248000,3,367,5.344827586206897
697859,5,6303544584,"It would be hard to call this the world's best movie. The acting can be spotty. But the characters make it for me, and the wry angle on family relationships, and the sheer cheek of it all.
There hasn't been a scene  in years and years as perfect as the rooftop swimming pool scene --  depending on your taste for Ziegfield.
I saw this when it came out, and  owned the LP for years, though I lost it with some other belongings in a  flood, thanks to El Nino 1997 :) The coolest songs are ""Tough""  and ""I Want to Live in a House.""
Nana is such a loving  character. I want a Nana like her :)
This movie is pretty cheap for what  you get. It's a fun ""video night"" movie to impress your friends  with, as most of them hasn't seen it and they'll all think you're really  cool.
Everyone's library should have Starstruck in it.

697860,5,6303544584,"The movie is light, but very funny. Aussie accents get only a little thick at times. A good movie for light entertainment. Loved the soundtrack, so I bought it--and am glad, since it's not out on CD. I was (and still am) a  big fan of the late 70s-early 80s bands from Australia and New Zealand, and  this film showcased a number of them!",957139200,2,338,4.265625

Here's  hoping that they release it on CD someday!",937180800,,263,4.1568627450980395

First of all it was made in Austraila and it shows through out the whole movie, from the style of new wave music that they use and the sly or not so sly cultural references.

Unfortunately, I opened it after it was too late to return it!  Very disappointed.  Be warned if you buy this product to open it immediately to check to see that both discs are there and working so you can return it in a timely manner.

Jo Kennedy was not in the movie I received, nor was Ross O'Donovan.  None of the music mentioned is actually in this movie.",1472515200,,435,4.8108108108108105
