7901871,4,6302241987,"Low-key coming of age movie that does a nice job of highlighting some phenomenal New Zealand scenery. It's an older film shot on a small budget, and the direction and acting of some scenes is stilted, but overall a beautiful glimpse into New Zealand, so much so that I toured the country 10 years later after seeing this film when it first came out on VHS in the early '80's.",1409875200,,375,4.371428571428571
