8502461,4,B006OV4W7G,"This film is a followup to the five-part MIYAMOTO MUSASHI film series released by Toei Motion Picture Co. starring Kinnosuke Nakamura as Musashi and directed by Tomu Uchida.  In this story, Musashi meets one of his other rivals in perfecting his martial arts, Baiken Shishido, who is an expert with the chain and sickle.  Having never faced these weapons before, he uses all his skill and intelligence he has learned in previous duels to win over this new style opponent.  This segment was not covered in the previous five-film series, hence the sequel and a welcomed addition to complete the story of the Musashi saga.

As for the DVD, Region 2 Italian release, although the info on the back of the package insert says it is Enhanced for 16x9 HD TV, it is not.  It will show black bars on all sides of the picture, top, bottom, and both sides, and you will need a Multi-Region DVD player to view the disc due to the Region 2 release.  Beware too, it has NO English Subtitles.",1336176000,,976,4.548571428571429
