3527112,5,B001D7T6AO,"I think Idiots Deluxe was simply hilarious but it was the last film they did with an energetic Curly.  On the next film ""If a Body meets a Body."" watch at the end when the Stooges are running down the stairs, it isn't Curly but a double. He also seems slower and not as energetic, on the next film Micro Phonies he seems to be back.

To me he was the funniest comedian figure that ever lived but because they couldn't treat high blood pressure and he drank alot he had these strokes that finally ended his career and life.

I hope they'll be Shemp following the Curly movies.",1218585600,9,575,4.256880733944954
3527113,5,B001D7T6AO,"This set completes the better Curly shorts, towards the end of this set he started suffering mini-strokes and the effects show on screen.  But for the most part, Curly is still full of energy!

The 21 shorts are:

1943
They Stooge to Conga (wartime. Moe disguises as Hitler!)
Dizzy Detectives
Spook Louder
Back From The Front (wartime)
Three Little Twerps
Higher Than A Kite  (wartime)
I Can Hardly Wait  (one of the weaker ones, Curly has a bad tooth)
Dizzy Pilots  (wartime)
Phony Express
A Gem Of A Jam

1944
Crash Goes The Hash
Busy Buddies
The Yoke's on Me  (wartime stereotypes)
Idle Roomers
Gents Without Cents (features ""Niagara Falls"" routine)
No Dough Boys  (wartime)

1945
Three Pests In A Mess (nice cemetery comedy for Halloween)
Booby Dupes  (wartime joke at the end of this non-wartime comedy. Stooges go fishing.)
Idiots Deluxe  (first evidence of Curly's mini-strokes & 1st with black title-card)
If a Body Meets a Body
Micro-Phonies (still a classic, even with the mini-stroke)

--A word about Curly's decline:
Curly would go on to film 10 more shorts in the next year, but none of them equaled the quality of these.
Even the last three shorts of this set show the signs of health problems.
In IDIOTS DELUXE the failing health starts to show in Curly's face, but his voice is still stong & energetic.
IF A BODY MEETS A BODY shows the first full signs of a stroke. Not only has Curly's face changed, but his voice has now dropped & speach patterns become more labored. His energy levels have dropped noticably (a body double is used near the end).
MICROPHONIES gives hope for a recovery.  Curly still lacks his old energy but he seems enthused and energized with the script.  However his voice & face remain the same.
The real devastations will show up in the next set as Curly is unable to finish 1946'S BEER BARREL POLECATS, leaving only half a short filmed and forcing the director to pad out the film with 8 minutes of stock footage from earlier films.  I don't know if this health-related sortcut gave Columbia the idea to save money on future Shemp Shorts by using large segments of stock footage, but it is the start of a bad trend at Columbia Short Subjects Department.  The future arrival of Shemp forced Columbia to stop this for a while as Curly footage could not fit well in a Shemp film.
Well, more on this when volume 5 comes out.

***STOOGES V.S. STOOGE***
One problem I have with some of the last comedies in this set is the scripts putting stooge against stooge, breaking up the team.
In IDIOTS DELUXE Larry & Curly take Moe to court for beating them up. The short then goes into the story of why Moe did this.  The story itself is top form Stooge comedy.  I can just imagine the brainstorming session in the story room: ""Hey what if the boys get tired of Moe hitting them and take him to court!  That would be a new twist.""
IF A BODY MEETS A BODY starts on an off note with Larry & Moe getting tired of Curly's foolishness and telling him to leave. A sobbing Curly packs to go when Larry & Moe see a newspaper article announcing the search for a missing heir to a fortune: Curly Q. Link.  Suddenly Moe & Larry want Curly to be their friend again & appologize.
I always thought of the Stooges as tight friends, through slap & eye poke.  Basically they are one being to me, not three individuals.  It is a down note for me to see them fighting against each other, even if it is a story plot device.",1217289600,159,3431,4.470304975922954

3527171,5,B001D7T6AO,"Well, Volume 3 covered what I consider to be the ""Golden Age"" of Moe, Larry, Curly shorts & now we move into the mid 1940s with the stooges still going strong--although the end of this collection shows us the decline of Curly's physical health, starting with the short ""If a Body Meets a Body"" where it's very clear that this was not the Curly of old.

But--despite his health problems--I still enjoy ""Body"" and ""Micro-Phonies"" was the first short released that featured the directorial talents of Edward Bernds. Bernds actually directed ""A Bird in the Head"" first, but Bernds and producer Hugh McCollum wisely decided to put ""Micro-Phonies"" out ahead of schedule.

Earlier in this volume, we have the benefits of a still vital Curly at the peak of his comedic powers and the last remaining wartime shorts.

Other standouts shorts for me from this volume would include ""Crash Goes the Hash"", ""Booby Dupes"", and ""Gents Without Cents"" which features the classic ""Niagara Falls"" routine.

The only negatives from this collection might be the fact that this was the time period where director Del Lord also began to co-write as well as direct his stooge shorts & the results were often mixed.

Also, this collection includes the controversial film ""The Yokes On Me"" which covers the black eye on American history that was the relocation camps many Japanese-American citizens were forced into during the war years.

But on the plus side, this volume of stooge shorts also introduced us to the great actress Christine McIntyre--who would become in many stooge fan's eyes the greatest female lead to appear in many of the stooge films and she continued to work with the boys all the way til 1955.

3527203,4,B001D7T6AO,"I recently purchased the first five Stooge DVD volumes and am gonna give away my aging VHS Tapes. The shorts on this collection in my opinion are of a much higher quality than those in the 30's. I think the scripting is better, the acting, the plot, and it just appears far more creativity was put into these shorts than most of the 30's. There is some stock footage used in some shorts which I find unfortunate, but from what I understand not nearly as excessive as many done during the later Shemp years. One gripe about the shorts is that there are some portions where the transfer to digital did not go very well, and the picture seems colorized. I compared a episode to the VHS version and its obvious Sony messed up the transfer and the VHS version displays in full black and white. The episode ""Three Little Twirps"" is an excellent example of what I am talking about. Another complaint is that when I have tried to play all episodes from the main menu, often the disc does not do so and goes back to the beginning of the episodes for some reason.

And Volume 4 is by far the best volume in the set (they all have good points and bad, but this one is best overall, IMO).  This volume showcases the boys in their prime years.  If you're only going to own one volume, this is the one.

I proceeded to tape these treasures on ... Beta tapes ! When Beta died that horrible death I refused to toss my tapes. Since then the only episodes available on VHS or DVD seemed to be the same. ""Sing a Song of six pants"" and ""Hoi Polli"" come to mind. Now I am happy as can be as they FINALLY released these in Chronological order. Some of us 50+ year old kids will for the first time see these UNEDITED. I finally got to see the episodes as intended not chopped up to fit in commercials. There are scenes I have never seen before.

3527212,5,B001D7T6AO,"This is a review for the two disc box set of the Three Stooges Columbia Pictures
Box Set entitled ""The Three Stooges Collection, Volume Four (1943-1945). It is a fully remastered 21 short subjects
set released by Sony, another in the fine series that just keeps on rolling out
of the Sony/Columbia door at very reasonable prices  to document one of the most
remarkable comedy careers in Hollywood history.

But at end, this box set is the last of the, in my opinion, greatest of the
Stooges, Curly Howard. Curly had health problems but kept on working although
at diminished capacity and finally was forced to retire during 1946 after what
is described as a mild stroke.

So this 21 episode set pretty much wraps up the Curly years and even though
he has slowed down he's as inventive as ever in 'Micro- Phonies,"" as an out of
control opera diva and joins the boys in discovering enemy soldiers, agents and
just plain spies in ""They Stooge to Conga,"" and ""Back From the Front,"" as well as
being mistaken for Japaneese soldiers themselves in ""No Dough Boys.""

Taking nothing away from the other Stooges but in my book Curly was the heart
and soul of this golden era comedy act and his leaving the scene the way
he did reminds us that even the best and the brightest cannot burn with genius
forever. We are lucky to have his contributions on film and Curly Howard will
always be remembered with fondness and joy.

So I give ths Three Stooges box set another five star rating because it is chock
full of humor and outright belly laughs, the kind that are not that easy to come
across these days or probably at any time.  Five Stars with pleasure.",1278460800,2,1643,4.515151515151516
3527213,4,B001D7T6AO,"The Golden Age of Stoogery draws to a close in this 1943-45 collection. ""Crash Goes the Hash"" and ""Micro-Phonies"" rank among Moe, Larry and Curly's all-time best comedies, with ""Dizzy Detectives,"" ""Phony Express"" and ""Idle Roomers"" not far behind. If you want ultra-violence, look no further than ""They Stooge to Conga."" The wartime shorts are best represented by ""No Dough Boys"" and ""Back to the Front"" (featuring Moe's classic Hitler impersonation). By 1945, Curly Howard's health problems become evident in the lackluster ""Idiots Deluxe"" and ""If a Body Meets a Body,"" yet he rises to the occasion for ""Micro-Phonies""  the first release from writer-director Edward Bernds. However, not even the Stooges at their peak can redeem two genuine misfires: ""The Yoke's On Me"" and ""I Can Hardly Wait."" Decreased budgets and formulaic scripting result in standard fare along the lines of ""Three Pests in a Mess"" and ""Dizzy Pilots""  the latter resorting to tacked-on footage from ""Boobs in Arms"" (1940). Sony's digitally remastered DVD set has more than enough laughs to satisfy any Stoogephile, but the seeds of creative decline can be found here.",1276732800,2,1140,5.190217391304348

3527215,4,B001D7T6AO,"Volume Four of the two disc set of The Three Stooges greets us with film shorts ranging in release dates from Jan/43 to Nov/45. It is certainly a mixed bag of shorts to be sure but they are generally pretty good with everyone's favourite Stooge Curly still on hand to provide some good laughs. I won't give away which ones they are but watch for each of the guys to forget a line or two periodically while watching. Moe was usually the glue that held them all together but even he got a little flummoxed at times. However one sees almost from the start that there is something a little off kilter with the Stooges in this set and most of it stems from Curly himself. He is noticeably more bloated and more fatigued looking in these shorts and in fact they were just 10 shorts away from what would prove to be his last full time role with the rest of the guys. Curly's last kick at the Stooge can came just three shorts after he left the group(and brother Shemp took over)in a cameo appearance. He would be filmed a couple of years later in a another short but his appearance was left on the cutting room floor(boy,to have THAT film today!!).He was in poor health emotionally and physically and sad to say he would go on to suffer two strokes before eventually passing away in 1952.
Most of the shorts in Volume Four are your typical Stooges fare and they range from great to alright. One of the best in this set is ""Gents without Cents"".The Stooges here do some WW2 morale entertaining and it preserves their stock and trade routine ""Niagara Falls"".There are also a couple of other shorts involving references to the war and the Axis. A real bomb but one which started out promisingly is their well known ""Dizzy Pilots"".They start out as inventors of a rubberized substance designed to revolutionize and enhance the war effort. If they succeed they will get a defense contract,if not they will be inducted into the army(makes sense,right?).The rubber substance is in a trough and of course Moe gets pushed into it. Someone comes up with the idea to inflate the now hardened rubber and cut it off. But of course Moe goes flying off into the sunset until he comes sailing back to terra firma thanks to buck shot from Curly and Larry! Very funny stuff for about 5 minutes. Then seemingly having run out of ideas as to where to take the short,they just splice in the army sequence from the previous short ""Boobs in Arms"" to finish it. Terrible.
Moe Howard once remarked that he was certain Abbott and Costello were stealing some of their routines. It is amazing because if you watch any of these shorts and have even a passing knowledge of other famous comedians works like Keaton,Harold Lloyd or many of the Keystone comedies,you will see variations on a myriad of gags lifted partially and/or wholly from these sources;redone right before your eyes,Stooge style. This is not to say they were just poor rip offs. No sir,the Stooges did remarkably well when they did them and even surpassed the originals on occasion. But the Stooges all time favourite source to mine for gag ideas had to be Laurel and Hardy and we have two fine examples of that in this collection.""Booby Dupes"" opens with the Stooges as fish salesmen(they had done a similar routine in an earlier short).Its' beginning is taken hook,line and sinker from Laurel and Hardy's Dec/32 short ""Towed in a Hole"",right down to the dialogue and the record playing in the car engine. Also The Stooges ""If a Body Meets a Body"" is a remake/combination of two L&H shorts the Sept/30 ""Laurel-Hardy Murder Case"" and the Jan/34 short ""Oliver the Eighth"".In fact Fred Kelsey who appeared as a detective in the ""Laurel-Hardy Murder Case"" is again on hand playing a detective in this Stooges version! Remakes or no,the best comedians would mine the scary scenario(haunted houses,tombs,laboratories,etc.)for some of their best gags and the Stooges were in their natural element in these types of situations.
Here again The Stooges are seen either reusing footage from past shorts or we find footage that would be used later. I have mentioned ""Dizzy Pilots"" as one that used footage from a previous short. Footage from their short""Phony Express"" would be used in the /51 Stooges short""Merry Mavericks"".By the way this latter short featured two early film comedian legends Snub Pollard and Chester Conklin. This footage usage and re-usage from previous shorts would get worse and worse as the series went on as it was purely just a cost cutting measure. And unfortunately it cheapened and lessened the Stooges product;to a greater or lesser degree depending on the shorts plot and how well the footage fit in with it. But it has definitely never been one of my favourite things about their film product.
All in all Volume Four is still recommended. Technically the films have been transferred,as the previous volumes,beautifully. The Stooges are still on top of their game and even though Curly is starting to fade,he is at least still with us at this stage and that is something to be thankful for. I'm not looking forward to Volume Five and having to say goodbye all over again to Curly but let's move on and see what we can see,shall we? Soytenly.",1275868800,,5192,4.706593406593407

3527226,5,B001D7T6AO,"""Three Stooges"" Fans will be pleased that these 21 newly remastered shorts from Columbia / Sony Pictures are presented in chronological order complete and uncut, politically incorrect and in all they're Black & White splendor for fans to enjoy over and over. Hip Hip Hooray!

Once again Columbia / Sony Pictures have done an incredible job with the video and sound remastering in The Three Stooges Collection, Vol. 4: 1943-1945. Columbia / Sony Pictures should be commended for their ongoing efforts and for giving ""Three Stooges"" fans the best possible quality shorts ever released. The digitally remastered video transfers are simply amazing; no longer do these shorts look like they were made over 60 years ago and the completely restored soundtrack is the best I've ever heard the stooges sound.

Missing from these 21 newly remastered shorts is the debris, grain, dirt and sound hissing that used to plague these wonderful shorts. This wonderful set contains all 21 shorts from 1943-1945 on two single sided discs packaged in slim cases. The disc artwork and packaging is fantastic once again, making this set even more attractive and highly collectible for any Knucklehead to own.

It's no secret that Jerome ""Curly"" Howard was suffering from some major health problems in 1943-44 and his time as the most beloved stooge was quickly coming to an end. After a series of strokes and no longer able to perform at the level he was accustomed to, curly retired in 1946 and the ""Three Stooges"" were never the same. Although this set sadly marks the beginning of the end for Curly, fans should cherish every hilarious moment he gave us.

In my opinion some of the more memorable shorts in this collection are ""Micro-Phonies"", ""Dizzy Detectives"", ""Spook Louder"", ""Crash Goes the Hash"", ""Dizzy Pilots"" and ""Gents without Cents"" one of my absolute favorites. I can't wait to get the final 10 Curly shorts in volume five to complete his collection of stooge shorts and look forward to welcoming the newest stooge Shemp Howard.

DVD Shorts Include:

They Stooge to Conga / Dizzy Detectives / Spook Louder / Back From The Front / Three Little Twerps / Higher Than A Kite / I Can Hardly Wait / Dizzy Pilots / Phony Express / A Gem Of A Jam / Crash Goes The Hash / Busy Buddies / The Yoke's on Me / Idle Roomers / Gents Without Cents / No Dough Boys / Three Pests In A Mess / Booby Dupes / Idiots Deluxe / If a Body Meets a Body / Micro-Phonies /",1233619200,,2437,4.695550351288056

It was a sad day when Curly Howard's career was cut short by health problems but few episodes in this set reveal the problems.

""They Stooge to Conga"" has our three boys taking on spies when they arrive to fix a doorbell.
""Dizzy Detectives"" finds them taking on a gorilla.
""Spook Louder"" has them hired to guard an inventor's spooky house. This is the short that has the mysterious pie thrower.
""Back From the Front"" has the boys at sea & the ship they're on is sunk. They're adrift at sea long enough to grow beards. They board an enemy ship & raise havoc with the Axis powers. Moe does another great imitation of the despised German leader.
""I Can Hardly Wait"" is the famous short where Moe attempts to pull Curly's tooth.
""Phony Express"" is one of their Western spoofs. In this one the boys are misidentified as three famous lawmen.
""A Gem of a Jam"" finds the boys working as janitors but thought to be doctors by three hoodlums.
""Idle Roomers"" has the boys taking on a version of the wolfman.
Gents Without Cents"" is one of my favorite shorts by the Stooges. This is the one where the boys do the Niagara Falls routine. ""Slowly I turned, step by step, inch by inch...""; Moe & Larry then proceed to rip Curly's clothes to shreds. Listen closely to them on the stage & you'll hear Moe & Larry mess up their lines.
""No Dough Boys"" finds our boys in Japanese uniforms & thought to be escaped prisoners.
""Idiots Deluxe"" is certainly one of the Stooges most violent episodes. Moe is being sued by Larry & Curly because he tried to kill them.""If a Body Meets a Body"" finds the Stooges involved in a murder-mystery.
""Micro-Phonies"" has Curly posing as Senorita Coocaracha, an opera diva who can't sing. Curly is actually miming to a record & then the real female singer. It's a classic episode.

It's a great collection for Stoogephiles that love to yuk it up with the boys. The prints are in pristine condition but there aren't any bonus features, not even subtitles. Thank you, Sony, for giving so much of the proper attention to restoring these prints.",1227312000,3,2203,4.518796992481203

shorts then we'll go into shemp. hope they do both stooges in the volume

3527247,5,B001D7T6AO,"Finally, someone has come out with good top quality collections of The Three Stooges. You have Lucy and other complete collections of classics yet it's taken years for someone to come out with a thorough collection of the Stooges work.  My only hope is that they don't stop at volume 4 and keep making more volumes.  I would like to see volumes containing all the shorts with Shemp in them too.  In some ways he is just as funny as Curly.  I think him and Moe played off each other a little better.  Anyway, I would highly recommend this volume and others in these new collections.  You can't buy any better versions of these works.

Beautiful transfers from the original 35 mm negatives these episodes can be seen in quality that has never been released on TV or home VHS and DVD before. And the best set of them all contains the widest variety of film shorts. Where the format of the depression-style episodes exit the back door, the Stooges try formats including one that offers staged vaudeville performances throughout the entire short! A couple feature scenes we would consider ""racial"" by today's standards but since we're more mature now than we used to be, we can accept these scenes as history and thank God Sony did not edit them. WWII enters the picture as the Stooges fight Germans and Japanese. Haunted House film shorts are included. Curly had a stroke during this era, so the later shorts you'll notice him performing solo for a number of scenes and he's lost a lot of weight. While the first three volumes (also recommended) contain the ""best of"" I do recommend this set for a chance to see something different.",1226016000,2,1019,4.762711864406779

I have taken so many poorly transferred (off the wall, back yard transfers) copies back to retailers in past years and demanded a full refund, but now I am confident this collection will be perfectly restored and transferred to the end of the series.

I own all four installments and my daughter and I enjoy each one immensely.  I hope Sony continues with the 5th and 6th and so on in the series as I am looking forward to the Shemp shorts.  By the way, for you who don't know, these sets are all in consecutive order beginning with the 1934 shorts and progressing on from there.  All in all a great set.

3527253,5,B001D7T6AO,"Sony Pictures is doing an excellent job with releasing the Stooges' films & have done so again in fine fashion with Volume Four!  As described on the DVD box, these films represent the final years with Curly before a series of strokes forced him to retire from the act in 1946.  This is evidenced in the last couple of shorts from 1945, especially in ""If A Body Meets A Body"", where it's painfully evident by watching Curly that his mannerisms have slowed & his speech has begun to slur.

Hopefully Sony will continue with the remarkable roll they've been on in releasing the shorts in order, especially the ones with Shemp shorts & even with Joe Besser.",1223596800,9,654,4.572649572649572
3527254,5,B001D7T6AO,This is yet another great Stooges set from Sony/Columbia. I can only hope the next set which should finish up the Curly shorts has some kind of extras. Interviews with the Stooges remaining relatives. Home movies. Interesting facts about them. Anything would be appreciated. Then it's on to the Shemp shorts.,1223510400,4,308,5.0588235294117645
3527255,5,B001D7T6AO,"These shorts never get old no matter how many times you view them. Even though there is a noticeable decline in health for Curly in these later shorts, he is still the undisputed king of The Three Stooges themselves.  The Stooges best and funniest shorts were with Curly and that is something even Larry and Moe admitted during interviews they both gave.

There's a reason why there are 97 Curly shorts and only 73 Shemp shorts (the last four of those frequently using recycled footage and a body double to fill in for a deceased Shemp).  Shemp was a part of the early Stooges act for only a few years when they were a second billed supporting act to entertainer Ted Healy on Vaudeville.  Shemp was only in one film of this early version of the stooges (Soup to Nuts-1930) and left after filming due to his dislike of Healy. Through these years they remained second rate and virtually unknown and struggled to earn reasonable pay. Shemp didn't rejoin the group after their separation from Healy because Curly quickly replaced him and was discovered to have a born gift for comedy.  After making that discovery, and seeing the clear increase in popularity, Larry and Moe couldn't have cared less about Shemp returning.

With the addition of Curly the popularity of The Stooges exploded and were soon given their own headlining contract with Columbia.  Moe and Larry only made an effort to include Shemp in the Columbia shorts after Curly couldn't act anymore.  That is the cold hard facts.  That's not to say that Shemp didn't have his moments when he was funny, because he was funny at times.  Comedy is not based on opinion as much as some would like to think though.

No matter what your opinion, nothing changes the facts:  The Stooges were all but invisible before Curly, and were returned to second rate after Curly had to leave the group due to his failing health. Shemp has his loyal followers and some claim to like them equally but there is no changing the fact that their biggest success began and ended with Curly's years in the trio. After Curly left, it was the end of an era.  Hopefully Columbia recognizes this as well and includes only the remaining 10 shorts of THE Three Stooges along with footage, interviews, and much deserved tributes to Curly.  Save the declining Shemp years for those that have to have everything with the Three Stooges name attached.",1223424000,5,2374,4.6891566265060245
3527256,4,B001D7T6AO,"THIS IS A FULLY VIEWED REVIEW OF AN ADVANCED COPY FROM SONY PICTURES RECEIVED ON 9/25/08.

A mere five weeks since Sony's third chronological compilation
of Three Stooges shorts dropped, along comes Volume 4. This
set showcases all 21 two reelers from the years 1943-1945.

Although it's not essential to view these shorts in chronological
order, it does help to see how the Stooges' pacing advanced. Their
earlier shorts had a slower pace to them. By this volume,
their manic style of slapstick was at its most feverish pace. And
by viewing them in release order on this set, it is very easy to see the
decline in Curly Howard's health. When viewing the shorts released in
1945, it is clear that Curly's performance has been altered noticeably by
the time ""Booby Dupes"" is screened.

The shorts on this set have one distinctive theme: they are more
cartoonish than ever before. The plots, such as they are, become
more transparent than the bald spot on Larry's head. With the lone
exception of the true classic ""Micro Phonies"", story and plot really take
a back seat during these years. Many feel that director Del Lord, who
is all over this set, lost his way during this period.

Overall, the restoration is on par with the previous three volumes. With the exception
of ""Crash Goes The Hash"" (with inferior audio) and ""Idiots Deluxe"" (which is riddled
with blemishes), the prints look and sound amazing. There are the usual soft spots
in some shorts (most noticeably in ""No Dough Boys""), but other than that, they look
brand new.

Volume 4 finishes up the war years and has some of the most violent
and un PC Stoogery to be found in their stellar career.

""They Stooge To Conga"" (***) contains the wince inducing ""spike"" scene.
Moe really gets it in this one. In fact, he gets it in the eye, head and ear.
The Stooges are repairmen and stumble upon Nazi spies when attempting
to fix a doorbell, destroying the house instead.
CLASSIC LINE: Nazi Spy: ""FBI, huh?"" Curly: ""No, I B Curly.""
FUN FACT: Watch for a very young Lloyd Bridges (who speaks five words).

""Dizzy Detectives"" (***) finds the Boys as cops tracking down an ape trained
to rob from stores. Yes, you read that correctly. As silly as it may sound, the
gags are aplenty with the great guillotine scene. I love Moe's reaction when he
thinks Curly has been axed!
CLASSIC LINE: Curly: ""I didn't see her, but I could swear--"" Moe: ""That's a
bad habit.""
Watch for a small recycling job from an earlier short ""Pardon My Scotch.""

""Spook Louder"" (***) is as close to a live action Looney Tunes as you're
likely to find. The Stooges are ""master salesmen"" who wind up guarding
an inventor's house so enemy spies won't steal his secrets. Weird noises,
goofy clocks, a menacing balloon and mysterious flying pies make this
nonsensical short a hoot to watch.
CLASSIC LINE: Moe: ""You dance like you got your legs on backwards.""

""Back From The Front"" (***) finds the Boys on a disguised Nazi raider and
capture the lot. Dressed up as the Axis partners, Moe delivers one of the
best lines in all of Stoogedom.
CLASSIC LINE: Moe: ""Ah, my personality, thanks Buddy!""

""Three Little Twirps"" (**1/2) The Boys find their way into a circus after ruining the
posters they were to be hanging.
CLASSIC LINE: Larry: ""Beat it, grandpa. We've got no time for kibbitzes.""

""Higher Than A Kite"" (**1/2) Once again, Moe gets it good when his head gets
stuck in a pipe. After ruining the General's car, they hide in a bomb (they think
its a sewer pipe) and get dropped in Naziville.
CLASSIC LINE: Nazi General: ""Sit on my lap."" Larry (in drag): ""What lap?""

""I Can Hardly Wait"" (**) revolves around Curly having a bad tooth, while Moe
and Larry come up with new ways to revolutionize dentistry.
CLASSIC LINE: Curly: ""You've got me bald headed in the mouth.""

""Dizzy Pilots"" (****) The Stooges are the Wrong Brothers who invent a plane
called ""The Buzzard."" During their test flight, things go terribly wrong and they
wind up getting drafted (a recycled scene from an earlier short ""Boobs In Arms"").
CLASSIC LINE: Curly; ""I see the garage. I don't saw the garage. You are
moidering the King's English.""

""Phoney Express"" (***1/2) has the Stooges out west selling everything from
Abdul's Cactus Remedy to being deputized.
CLASSIC LINE: Curly: ""Hmm, pepperminties.""

""A Gem Of A Jam"" (***) Mistaken for doctors, the Boys are on the run from
crooks and cops. The second half of this short is utter nonsense and in any other
hands, it wouldn't hold up. A testament to how great the Stooges were that they're
so convincing at selling the silliest of ideas. The bits with Dudley Dickerson
are priceless. The x-ray scene is a keeper, as well.

""Crash Goes The Hash"" (****) A great short with the Stooges who work for
Star Press Cleaners. A newspaper editor thinks they work for the media
and hire them to expose Prince Sham. The print looks great, but the audio is
surprisingly poor. The previous DVD release had better audio.
CLASSIC LINE: Butler: ""Such levity. You remind me of the Three Stooges.""
Curly: ""Hey, that's an insult.""

""Busy Buddies"" (***) Another bit of utter (or is that udder) nonsense as the Stooges enter a milking contest to win some fast cash. Damn if they don't pull it off, though.

""The Yolk's On Me"" (*) A real mess. Forget about the PC issue, this short
just doesn't work. I smile at the fan dance Curly does with the ostrich
feathers, but other than that, it's just a sloppy short that isn't funny.

""Idle Roomers (***1/2) All hail Lupe the Wolf man! The Stooges discover
the wolfman (in ridiculous make up) running amuck in the Hotel Snazzy Plaza.
As janitors, it's up to the Boys to catch him.
CLASSIC LINE: Moe: ""Did you lock the door?"" Curly: ""Yeah, twice. Once this
way and once that way.""
HISTORIC CASTING: Stooge regular, the lovely Christine McIntyre makes her
Stooges debut.

""Gents Without Cents"" (**1/2) Another misfire, it would be unwatchable if not
for the Niagra Falls and ""Ratt-tat-toodily- day-day"" numbers. The casting of
Flo, Mary and Shirley (as a poorman's Andrews Sisters) weigh this short
down like a ton of bricks. Their cartwheel shtick seems to go on forever!

""No Dough Boys"" (***1/2) has the Stooges dressed as Japanese soldiers
for an ad shoot. On a lunch break, the owner thinks they are real ""Jap"" spies.
Running away, they stumble (yet again) into a Nazi hideout. UN PC humor
at its best.
CLASSIC LINE: Moe: ""Naki, Waki, come backi.""

""Three Pests In A Mess"" (**1/2) A pretty flimsy script that gets saved by
Christine McIntrye's performance and, of course, the Stooges. This short
has such a cheap production to it, that during a supposed masquerade party,
nobody bothered to add a crowd noise on the soundtrack, let alone having a
few extras walk past the camera. It looks exactly what it is: two actors trying
to sell the idea that there is a party going on in an empty sound stage. Jeez, not even music in the background.
CLASSIC LINE: Larry: ""What's the idea, porter? Mammy!""

""Booby Dupes"" (**) The first real evidence that Curly's health is starting to get
the best of him. A weak effort doesn't help things, either. Watch Curly struggle
to hide under the boat. The Stooges, as fish salesmen (again), try to catch their
own for better profits. Again, this short has a particularly cheap feel to it. The
scene with the fish flying all over the place would be right at home in a bad
grade school production. And where did they get the second boat!?

""Idiots Deluxe"" (**1/2) isn't much better. There's a few good bits in the cabin,
but overall, a weak short with a much more haggard Curly. So far, the shorts
have been restored to a like new brilliance. This title however, looks terrible. The
print is riddled with spots, debris, lines, scratches as if no restoration was done.
CLASSIC LINE: Moe: ""Sunny side down. And don't turn 'em over.""

""If A Body Meets A Body"" (***) A decent scare comedy, but no classic, by any
means. The Stooges stand to inherit some dough when Curly's uncle bites it.
A remake of ""The Laurel and Hardy Murder Case"".
CLASSIC LINE: Butler: ""I hope you have a nice looong sleep."" Moe: ""Thanks,
Dracula.""

""Micro Phonies (****) is the Citizen Kane of Three Stooges films. Thankfully,
Curly's ill health did not interfere with his performance, as this short has everything
the last handful didn't. The story is solid, the directing is sharp, the pacing is spot
on, and the supporting cast is fantastic. It's the last great Curly performance (although
""Three Little Pirates"" comes close). The Stooges are Senorita Cucaracha, Senior
Mucho and Senior Gusto. They swipe a record and do a great aping of ""Voices
Of Spring"" at a swanky party. That is, until their deception is discovered. The print
is beautiful and all of Christine McIntyre's dialogue has been fully restored. All
previous video releases had the annoying jump/splice cut during her explanation
as to why she had to pursue her singing career under an assumed name. This is the
last great Stooges short until Shemp re-joins the team. Always compared unfairly,
the Shemp era had some of the best storylines and plots (before budget cuts caused
a slew of remakes), but that's another review.......

3527257,5,B001D7T6AO,"As a Stoogephile since 1950, I have watched these shorts all my life. Each of the 190 or so short subjects carries something about it that attracts comedy fans of all ages. But only a handful of Stooges shorts can really be called classics. Among those are their regular parodies of Hitler and Stalin, the unforgettable ""A-Plumbing We Will Go,"" and their magnificent World War II short, ""Boobs In Arms.""

In my opinion, one title carried in this pacakge -- ""Busy Buddies"" -- is in that handful of classic Stooges skits that transcends time for comedy and will be watched as long as people watch comedy and laugh. In this little movie, the Stooges first own a restaurant, which they may lose to debt, forcing the team to enter a cow-milking contest to save the restaurant.

In an early scene a debtor arrives in the restaurant, demands payment from Moe, who's behind the counter, and starts to get steamed, and eventually agrees to have a cup of coffee. Meanwhile, Curly is painting the place...from a coffee cup full of paint. Curly's painting out of a cup of coffee...the debtor's drinking coffee...you know what's going to happen next. Not long afterward, another debtor tries to eat some strange pancakes.

Later, the boys throw Curly into a fenced area with a bull to learn how to milk a ""cow."" The bull instead tosses Curly out with one of those great sound effects that made the Stooges famous, an effect I have copied and used all my life in similar situations. The boys toss him back in and Curly eventually swings majestically from a telephone pole. When the boys get to the actual cow-milking contest, the humor becomes almost unbearable.

I've been watching this a half-century and ""Busy Buddies"" is among the greatest comedy skits I've ever seen. It's up there with the ""Fridays"" (a short-lived Friday night ripoff of Saturday Night Live) skit in the Reagan era where Seinfeld's Michael Richards played Reagan in ""Altered Statesman,"" which merged the psychedlic effects of the then-popular film ""Altered States"" with Reagan's presidency and his past life as an actor. In one scene, Reagan, after taking peyote, hallucinated the 20 mule team from the Boraxo ads used on a TV program he hosted in the 1960s.

If you've never seen ""Busy Buddies,"" you are in for quite a treat!",1221350400,15,2285,4.789340101522843
3527258,5,B001D7T6AO,"I'm glad to see that Volume 4 is being released in a timely manner. These are the later ones with Curly right around the time he began experiencing health problems (as they used doubles for him in a few shorts). It's sad to think about how Curly had to leave the team, but I do have fond memories of shorts such as ""Micro-Phonies"" in which Curly seems to be enjoying himself.
I imagine Volume 5 will complete the Curly years and dive into the early Shemp years.",1220832000,4,461,4.310344827586207
3527259,5,B001D7T6AO,"This fourth installment of THE THREE STOOGES COLLECTION brings Moe,Larry and Curly in their adventures of the last of World War II. In THEY STOOGE TO CONGA,Moe,his brother Curly and Larry come around to repair an ill-functioning doorbell and replace wires on a telephone pole. Again,in one scene,we'll see Moe posing as Germany dictator Adolph Hitler,subbing for a framed photo,or painting of Hitler! DIZZY DETECTIVES begins with stock footage from 1935's PARDON MY SCOTCH,where the boys install a door in a drugstore. Curly does some power-sawing on the floor,with Moe underneath the not-yet-installed door and Curly saws a hole in the floor causing Moe to fall through downstairs. In the original scene,Larry tells Moe,""You only fell 14 feet!"". They then receive word that they've been hired to join the local police force. They encounter a gorilla who is learning to rob like his owner and his gang members. BACK FROM THE FRONT is one of a few war-themed shorts with the boys on a ship,paying a short visit to their girlfriends' home while on a furlough. Again,we'll see Moe as Hitler,complete with square moustache. In SPOOK LOUDER,the boys have been hired to sublet an inventor's home while he travels to Washington,D.C. A trio of crooks in Halloween costumes plan to rob the home. In THREE LITTLE TWERPS,the poster-pasting Stooges join the circus. In another war-themed short,HIGHER THAN A KITE,the boys are service station attendants and end up politicians in Germany. Curly breaks a tooth(molar) in I CAN HARDLY WAIT. An exploding dynamite stick didn't cure Curly's toothache,nor did a pushed door(with a string around the knob with the other end of the string around Curly's aching tooth). But a punch in the mouth from Moe did! The tooth was extracted as a result of the punch. In DIZZY PILOTS,the Stooges are the Wrong brothers,inventors of a revolutionary aircraft,an idea that never came to the minds of the real-life Wright Brothers. They end up in the army after the aircraft failed to meet standards(stock footage from 1940's BOOBS IN ARMS). The Stooges are wanted for vagrancy in PHONY EXPRESS. In A GEM OF A JAM,the boys are custodians ordered by two gangsters to perform necessary surgery on their friend. In CRASH GOES THE HASH,the boys are hired by a newspaper editor to get a story on a widow's engagement. Her foreign fiance robs her safe and is later arrested. The boys receive $100 each and Curly receives an added prize:the widow's hand. In BUSY BUDDIES,to pay an outstanding debt,Moe and Larry enter Curly in a cow-milking contest. Moe and Larry don the two-man cow costume with Moe distributing the milk from a large container. Curly is disqualified after giving Moe and Larry away. In THE YOKE'S ON ME,the boys run a farm and a group of Japanese men steal pumpkins. The Stooges are bellboys in IDLE ROOMERS and discover a gorilla who later operates the elevator the Stooges ride. The boys meet their upstairs neighbors and later marry Flo,Mary and Shirley in GENTS WITHOUT CENTS. The boys posing as Japanese men fight real Japanese men in NO DOUGH BOYS. The boys receive a patent for their fly-catching invention in THREE PESTS IN A MESS. In BOOBY DUPES,the seafood-retailing Stooges plan to catch their own to sell after buying a boat which they end up wrecking. In IDIOTS DeLUXE,Moe is tried in court for mayhem(physically abusing Moe and Larry) and is later acquitted. In IF A BODY MEETS A BODY,Curly Q. Link's uncle Bob O. Link has died and Curly anxiously awaits his monetary inheritance(his sister Liza receives the $1,250,000 and Curly receives the 67 cent change!). In MICRO-PHONIES,Curly,in drag,lip-synchs a woman's recording of VOICES OF SPRING. A foreign man gives Curly away at a party(""Look,peoples! Just a big fake!""). This is dedicated to the memories of Moe(1897-1975),Larry(1902-1975) and Curly(1903-1952).",1219795200,6,3853,5.040752351097178
