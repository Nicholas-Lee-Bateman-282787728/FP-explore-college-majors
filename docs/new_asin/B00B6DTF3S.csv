8563262,5,B00B6DTF3S,"I really didn't know what to expect going into this show.  Cute character designs, bubbly school girls and... werewolves?  Well... that's all there, kind of, but honestly, the show is so much more.  It's a fun adventure that never falls back on extreme violence or shock to sell it's story.  The show actually feels very restrained, keeping most of the graphic content off screen.  Instead the show builds a very interesting, likable cast of characters, and gives them a surprisingly well thought out and entertaining story to work through.  The tone of this show could have very easily been a disaster, with it's mixture of horror and more cutesy elements, but somehow it all clicks together, and balances itself out perfectly.

I highly recommend this show.  The art is beautiful, the story exciting, and the series has a very exciting, and fulfilling ending.  Check it out!

Side Note:  This show does not have a Dub.  For me, personally, I didn't mind.  For others, though, the lack of an English language audio track might be a deal breaker, so just a heads up.",1383350400,6,1066,4.791208791208791
8563263,5,B00B6DTF3S,a young brave boy changes her way of life from killing to stopping completely and letting someone else take over!  Life is precious and i thank this brave boy for changes her heart even though he was scared he told her face to face how much better her life and all the people of the village could join together as one and get along...  i faced a new awakening to what kindness in the face of extreme odds can change from a heart of concern for all!  Wonderful!  i hope everyone will taste this realization and try it out? i enjoyed it with every fiber of my being.,1373587200,,564,4.194444444444445
8563264,4,B00B6DTF3S,"Ryukishi07, the creator of this series, is known for creating series with mystery and horror that messes with your mind. Consequently, a lot of the hate that this series receives comes from fans of his work that expected something of the same caliber as Higurashi (a.k.a. When They Cry) and Umineko, previous works of his. The fact that this has a TV-14 rating and only 12 episodes (the last of which is actually more of an extra episode) should be a hint that this won't be on the same level. It *is* a horror mystery, but it doesn't mess with your mind nearly as much. That doesn't mean it's not enjoyable, though. It just means that Okamikakushi is a bit different from what he's known for.

Fans of Higurashi will notice a few similarities between it and Okamikakushi. The setting is a village, there's something that can make the residents (or at the very least, some of them) act berserk-- a dam even gets involved in both of them. (Perhaps some of these similarities were done as a nod.) The background music did fit the mood, but I thought that it lacked some punch-- The music didn't send any chills down my spine or anything. The animation quality is pretty good... It's not amazing or eye-popping, but there weren't any imperfections. Much to my dismay, Okamikakushi did have some CG animation that I felt wasn't needed-- using CG animation during the hunts was understandable, but I didn't like that the car in the beginning was animated that way too.

Overall, I think that Okamikakushi is a decent series, but I feel that it doesn't have much to make it stand out from the crowd. But do I think it's worth looking into? Absolutely.",1373155200,2,1645,4.610921501706485
8563265,3,B00B6DTF3S,"Ookami Kakushi is an alright show. Its sad, happy, and angry. It has a happy ending (thank god), at first I thought it was going to have a crappy ending; However, I was hopping for more towards love/romance in this anime. Here is a link to a web-sight for this anime in case you want to buy it after words.

For my recommendation DON'T BUY IT!!!",1370390400,,352,4.2388059701492535
