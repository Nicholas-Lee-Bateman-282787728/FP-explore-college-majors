7824408,4,6302332672,"Unlike the previous reviewer, I found this video quite satisfying. It's about an hour long and gives enough information to let the viewer decide which homes/castles to visit. My favorite was Chatsworth with its beauiful gardens. Blenheim Palace was a treat since I didn't recall Winston Churchill having such a notable background. Anyone requiring more detailed information would do well to read some in depth history books. But for a visitor to England, this is a feast for the eyes. Enjoy!",1161475200,3,491,5.074074074074074
