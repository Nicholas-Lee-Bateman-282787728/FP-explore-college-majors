8582474,2,B00CJDDRVA,"The description for this series sounded so good, and is a genre I favor, so I bought Series 1 and Series 2. I didn't care for it at all. I think the Swedish version of Wallander with Krister Henricksson is SO good that it ruined me for anything less.
I returned both series of The Protectors. No point in keeping it.",1395187200,,316,4.19672131147541
