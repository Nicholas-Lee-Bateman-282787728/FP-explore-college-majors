2570368,5,B000FKO3T4,My daughter loves this DVD - it has some of their older songs and the new ones too!  It is also a long concert so it keeps her entertained for awhile so I can get some things done around the house!,1171756800,5,197,3.8048780487804876
2570369,5,B000FKO3T4,"My 2 year old loves this CD - it is by far his favorite.  This disc shows why the Wiggles are so appealing to children.  During this show, the group is very interactive with the audience.  My son recently watched this video with his 7 year old cousin, who got bored of the Wiggles a while back, and he loves this as well.

I would highly recommend this for any Wiggles fan.",1171238400,6,373,4.138888888888889
2570370,5,B000FKO3T4,"This was for my oldest Grand Daughter.  She loved it!  It gets played a LOT here at my home when they come to visit.  My daughter knows the words to many of the songs, so watching my Grand Daughter and listening to my daughter becomes very interesting.  Also, my daughter was playing with my youngest Grand Daughter which made her laugh and I was able to catch that with my new digital camera set to the movie position.  Meanwhile, the oldest one was watching it.",1168819200,3,463,4.4
2570371,5,B000FKO3T4,"The Wiggles provide educational and entertaining fun to young children.  Our grandson is a Wiggles fan, and this DVD  has become his favorite.  As a parent, and now grandparent, I like the Wiggles good, clean fun in a dancing and singing forum.  Music is a great teacher for children.",1168387200,3,284,4.73469387755102
2570372,5,B000FKO3T4,"This Wiggles Live in the USA DVD is wonderful to watch especially since we saw them perform in Chicago. It's a must have even more so now that Greg Wiggle has retired, and it is one of his last live performances. It has a great extra episode, and everything about it is very good.",1167782400,4,280,4.203703703703703
2570373,5,B000FKO3T4,"This is a fantastic Wiggles tape.  Having seen the Live performance in Pittsburgh in August, this tape brought back great memories of their performance.  The adults as well as the children were singing and dancing the whole time.  The Wiggles and the dancers, Wags, Dorothy and Henry, have such a good time performing and the audience responds in kind.  I recommend this tape to anyone who loves to sing and dance and have fun.",1162598400,7,427,4.72972972972973
2570374,4,B000FKO3T4,"I thought this DVD was just ""OK"".  It's basically the same old songs from the Wiggles and quite similar to their ""Wiggles Live"" DVD, although at least this was live in the USA, and not Australia.  I watched their USA concert (in San Jose, CA) and it's the same exact concert as what you see in this DVD (filmed in Connecticut). There's also a total of 24 songs, not 25 like the back of the packaging states (they mis-counted) - I wonder why they never caught that error before producing millions of copies!  I also paid $19 for this DVD at Best Buy ... should've just ordered it online at Amazon ... much cheaper.  I don't think $19 was worth the DVD but my kids love the Wiggles and I always give in to buying them the DVD every time the Wiggles comes out with a new release.

I do have to say that I really did enjoy one part to this DVD - the 15 year celebration segment in the Special Features.  It was great seeing how the Wiggles got started 15 years ago and to see how much has changed since then.  For this reason, I give it 4 stars.",1159833600,4,1041,4.123762376237623
2570375,5,B000FKO3T4,"Since my family and I are going to see The Wiggles for the first time in 2 days,I was excited to see this video. All I can say is WOW!!!!It's going to be a spectacular show! The Wiggles and their dancers are engaging and energetic, particularly Anthony,who to me, steals the show(although I'm not convinced he really did those back flips!).The songs are all familiar here,but the energy and enthusiasm more then makes up for that. The Wiggles find fun ways to connect with their audience, such as suggesting dance moves, and,in the song We Love Athens,getting the crowd to yell ""OPAH!!"" every time the Captain holds up a sign. This concert takes place in Connecticut, in the good old USA ,and they look like they're having a great time. I reccommend this dvd to anyone over the age of 3 who wants to hear lots of great music and singing ,and be thoroughly entertained. Also of special interest,are the extras at the end of the DVD.Dorothy the dinosaur takes us on a special look back at all the highlights(and a few amusing hairdos!)of The Wiggles' amazing 15 year career, from their college days(when they actually played and sang on the sidewalk!)to the present. It is really neat to see. The bonus episode of Lights! Camera!Action! is cute too. Buy this video,and you and your children will NOT be disappointed. We love it!!",1155686400,19,1327,4.6995708154506435
2570376,5,B000FKO3T4,"The product seems almost new and was very inexpensive, I'm very happy with it and I'm sure my son will love it!",1376006400,,111,4.090909090909091

2570379,5,B000FKO3T4,I took my 2 year old daughter to see the Wiggles this past summer and she had so much fun at the concert so I was looking for a good concert video for her to enjoy. This DVD does not disappoint. She was so excited when I first put it in and she still watches it every day (two months later). If you are looking for a DVD like their TV show then this is not the one for you. Overall this is a great concert DVD and I would highly recommend it!!,1319328000,,443,3.774193548387097
2570380,5,B000FKO3T4,"I am constantly looking for children's entertainment that amuses my son and doesn't make me want to jab needles into my eyes.  When I actually am amused and entertained, I immediately post a review on amazon.com.  This is the only time I have ever done so.  Buy this, it's fun!",1317254400,,277,4.5
2570381,5,B000FKO3T4,I ordered this dvd for my 5 year old little girl. She has loved The Wiggles since she was 2.  She loves this dvd. It came so fast and it is in great shape. The tab that holds the dvd in the case was broken so the dvd was sliding around but that didn't matter.,1297900800,,259,3.709090909090909
2570382,5,B000FKO3T4,"My 19 month old son loves this!  He watches the wiggles everyday and this is his favorite dvd.  When he is not watching the wiggles, he will try to sing and dance the songs by himself.  It is hilarious to see him suddenly break out into hoop dee doo when we are out at a restaurant.  The daycare staff report that he does his wiggle dance moves there too.  I don't like to let him watch tv too much, but I don't mind this because he interacts with it - singing and dancing along.  At the end, when they say bye to the audience, he is right there with them, waving and shouting bye bye!",1273276800,,585,4.043478260869565
2570383,5,B000FKO3T4,My children loved this video.  This was actually a gift for my niece who watched it and wanted it.,1271376000,2,98,4.157894736842105

2570385,5,B000FKO3T4,OH MY GOODNESS!  This is a 5 star DVD.  My twin girls love it so much they really don't mind watching it over and over.  It is a great DVD of a live performance for The Wiggles.  WE LOVE IT !!,1243209600,,192,3.6097560975609757
2570386,5,B000FKO3T4,The songs can be a bit annoying after you've heard them over and over again hundreds of times. But our girls love to watch this DVD and sing and dance to it... It really holds their attention!,1230940800,,192,4.216216216216216
2570387,3,B000FKO3T4,"My 2 year old and I first sited the Wiggles on You Tube!  I immediately went online to buy DVD's with our favorite songs.  After reviewing several we found this one sub-par.  My DD just is not interested in the ""live"" performance ones.  The Wiggles are sometimes far away and employed in the performances (fun in person I'm sure) are little fun skit things as they do on their regular TV show (like let's find Jeff, etc) whereas my DD only had the patience to watch the singing.  If you LOVE Wiggles check out POP GO THE WIGGLES and Wiggles Nursery Rhymes.  Both of those are song after song in a studio.  They are newer releases and really keep the kids entertained.",1226016000,4,667,4.418032786885246
2570388,4,B000FKO3T4,"We took our 2 year old to his first Wiggles concert and this video captures what it's like to be there in person. Our son loves it and has watched it a zillion times, doing all the dances and singing along. The Wiggles are great that way--I don't know any other kid who just sits and watches--they all get up and move.",1223164800,,318,4.145161290322581
2570389,1,B000FKO3T4,"I give this a 1 star rating not based on content, but because of problems with the DVD itself.  We have a Panasonic DVD recorder and I've had problems trying to watch the dvd.  The first time it crashed my DVD recorder and I had to call Panasonic customer service to talk me through the problem.  I returned the product for a replacement, and the same thing is happening again.  In the meantime, all other DVD's have had no issues.  Too bad, my daughter liked it.",1222732800,,463,4.337209302325581
2570390,5,B000FKO3T4,"This was a love at first sight for my daughter, who has become a Wiggles groupie at 17 months of age.  This DVD has entertained her for months during our daily commute which is approx 1 hour long.  It's great.",1217548800,,209,4.2

2570393,5,B000FKO3T4,"When I bought this DVD I knew next to nothing of The Wiggles, as did my daughter.  She loved this DVD right away and was dancing in front of the tv. Since then we have bought many other DVDs, but this one is still her favorite. It's very fun and interactive. It's got a lot of the better Wiggles songs, and the dances are very easy, energetic, and fun.  If you want a Wiggles DVD this is the one to get.",1194998400,,403,3.962962962962963
2570394,5,B000FKO3T4,"My son has become addicted to the wiggles after this dvd. It is basically one of the Wiggles concerts recorded. But the songs are great, dancing is entertaining and the characters are lovable. Great fun for the kids.",1190851200,,216,4.7105263157894735
2570395,5,B000FKO3T4,"Wiggledancing is a new favorite for our 2 year old son, and it has created renewed interest in The Wiggles for our 5 year old daughter.

2570397,5,B000FKO3T4,"Kids love the wiggles. This is the best DVD by far. The Wiggles are fascinatingn for kids and tolerable for their parents.  (Some of them are really unbearably dorky).

The thing I like about it is that it encourages participation.,,am much happier watching her dancing than sitting!",1185062400,,290,4.290909090909091
2570399,5,B000FKO3T4,"Our son has never watched a single video for more than, say, 5 seconds until this went into the dvd player. wow. I'm a wiggles convert. He really enjoys watching it for 15 minutes at a time, and probably as he gets older (He's 23 months), he'll probably enjoy it more. The energy is high, everyone is having such a good time, and I even can watch it and enjoy the performances! That's a tall order, and this dvd delivers.",1182729600,,421,4.275

2570404,5,B000FKO3T4,"I bought this DVD for my 3 yo nephew's birthday - he absolutely loves it and watches it daily.

2570405,5,B000FKO3T4,"The Wiggles are featured performers at our house almost everyday.  Sharing a degree in Early Childhood Education with the wonderful guys who make up The Wiggles, I love that every song encourages movement as well as all the facets that help children become well rounded human beings.  My two year old twins dance with each other, bring Daddy and Mommy to the dance floor as well as try to bring our dogs (none of whom are named Wags!) in to the family dance time.

In a more sedentary, computer-crazed world, we're going to rely on those that can inspire and teach through exercise and song.  All the - especially original Wiggles - DVD's are much -worth looking into.  The songs are very catchy too.  I started with the DVD's, then invested in the CD's.
