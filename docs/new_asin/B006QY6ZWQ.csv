8503407,5,B006QY6ZWQ,"I first saw Lovelorn at a film festival (where it won a prize!) and was blown away. It's an incredibly impressive and memorable independent feature.

Writer/Director Becky Preston has created a stand out debut feature, a love story set between parallel worlds, where not everything is as it seems. I don't want to give any spoilers but I will say that a tragic motorcycle accident sets in motion a moving and emotional drama that takes some unexpected turns.

The cinematography and soundtrack are incredibly good, especially for an independent film, where often these are the first things to suffer. They have managed to make a lush and expensive looking British drama. The actors put in good performances and the story is moving and meditative. It stayed in my mind for a long while after the festival and was a crowd pleaser on the night.

The film has been compared to a British `Twilight' but personally I feel that its love story is so much more.

I'm glad I brought the DVD to revisit this wonderful film and found the `making of' DVD extras enlightening. I have since recommended it to various friends. A little gem of a film, more like it please!",1343606400,,1155,4.702970297029703
