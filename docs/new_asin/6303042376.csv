7835866,5,6303042376,"OK, Hank Drake, maybe some of us may have seen what's here somewhere else. This is still a great video for a number of reasons. First and foremost, the playing is amazing, and compiled very well from different places. Second, though not comprehensive, it offers a good look at Horowitz's life, soliciting accounts from interviews both with him and his wife. Also, there are three complete performances here which might weel be worth the price of the tape: the Rachmaninoff 2nd Sonata (with better sound quality than the original release of this recital), Scriabin's ""Vers La Flamme"", and Chopin's Introduction and Rondo. The latter two are from the 1974 footage featured here. The Scriabin is riveting, and the Chopin is brilliant and magical.(An aside - considering the quality of the recording, one could easily say it is much newer than 1974!) There are excerpts from other things he played during that same taping and all are very good - one hopes that this session will be released in full soon. Overall, it's a great video, both for those not so familiar or those already well acquainted with this monumental figure.",993168000,12,1122,4.910526315789474
7835867,3,6303042376,"Vladimir Horowitz--A Reminiscence, is aptly named. For Horowitz fans, it will bring back memories of all the familiar moments--the collaborations with Toscanini, the 1965 return to Carnegie Hall, the Moscow concert--but  offers little that is new.  There is no interview footage with other  musicians, collaborators, or members of the Horowitz' inner circle.  The  only figure shown, aside from Horowitz himself, is the pianist's widow,  Wanda Toscanini Horowitz.  She recites the usual anecdotes, prompted by an  off camera Peter Gelb--Horowitz' manager during the 1980s.  Wanda, who  arguably knew Horowitz better than anybody, avoids delving into certain  aspects of his non-musical life--she is even sketchy as to whether the  pianists' 1953 crisis, which brought on a 12-year retirement from public  performance, was a nervous breakdown or collitis, or both.  Other aspects  of Horowitz' life, ranging from his homosexuality to the tragic fate if his  Russian family (aside from his sister, no one in Horowitz' immediate family  survived Stalin's reign), to his disastrous 1983 concert in Japan are not  mentioned at all.
Another annoying factor is the almost total reliance on  performance footage which has been available for years--the Moscow recital,  the London recital, etc.  Aside from some grainy home movies and excerpts  from an abandoned 1974 documentary, there is nothing new here.  It would  have been a treat to see excerpts from his 1968 Carnegie Hall recital, the  1978 White House recital, or the 1978 Rachmaninoff Third concerto  performance.  The pianists' 1983 Tokyo recital was filmed and has wisely  never been released.  There are a few moments of insight here, but one  cannot escape the impression that this material was thrown together for one  purpose, to sell records.  With an artist of Horowitz' stature, that could  well be reason enough--but there could have been so much more.  Hopefully, someday someone will put together a real documentary about this  elusive figure.",962928000,21,2007,5.4058441558441555
