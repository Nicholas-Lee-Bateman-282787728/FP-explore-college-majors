8508503,5,B0071LQEXI,"This is by far one of the best westerns ever made since, Open Range in my opinion. I have not seen too many western but this one is amazing. Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday is amazing and Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp is awesome one of Kurt Russells best performances. I loved the part in the movie where Virgil, well played by Sam Elliot who is taking the wives away on a train and The Cowboys(who are the bad guys) are there to kill them but Wyatt Stops them, this is after Morgan Earp their brother gets murdered, which also was played well by Bill Paxton and Wyatt Tells Ike Clanton who is like the right hand to the group to tell their boss Johnny Ringo that he is coming for them and hell is coming with him. Best scene in the whole movie and the other great scene is where Ringo shows off his gun-twirling skills to Doc in the gambling house and Doc does it right back to him with a flask or a bottle cant remember, great scene. I thought the story was great, acting was great and the action as well. This is one of my top Ten Western films it is probably going to be at number One. If you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do. This movie is Cinematastic",1528070400,,1165,4.091703056768559
