Mr. Muller is the great man who brought us ""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer"", ""Frosty the Snowman"", ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town"", ""The Little Drummer Boy"", ""Here comes Peter Cottontail"" and many, many others. Everything that this man touched turned to gold and will live forever! What are you waiting for? Buy this video now!!!",980899200,2,501,4.837209302325581
