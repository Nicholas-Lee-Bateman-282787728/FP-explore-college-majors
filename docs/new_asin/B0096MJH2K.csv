5273761,5,B0096MJH2K,"I had seen the trailer of this movie a couple of times when catching other movies recently, and I have to say I was immensely intruiged by the premise of the movie. The movie finally opened this weekend here in Cincinnati and I went to see it right away.

""The Imposter"" (2012 release; 99 min.) brings the tale of Nicholas Barclay, a 13 yr. old kid in San Antonio who disappears one day without a trace in 1994, only to be miraculously found 3 1/2 years later in... Spain! As it turns out, the boy in Spain is not really Nicholas, but some French guy pretending to be Nicholas. He manages to talk his way through everything, fooling US and Spanish diplomatic and legal personnel alike, and ""long-lost Nicholas"" is returned to Texas, where he is eagerly awaited by his overjoyed ""family"". Life is good for a while, but when others get involved upon his return (a trauma specialist, the FBI, etc.) he is eventually found out to be an imposter. At this point, we are only half-way into the movie, and I asked myself, well, what else is left to be told? And that is where the documentary REALLY takes off, and had me on the edge of my seat all the way through. Don't worry, I'm not going to spoil the fun, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out. There is not a whole lot of historical footage in the movie (although there is the footage of Nicholas' arrival at the San Antonio airport, just fascinating, and also Sam Donaldson and Connie Chung TV clips when the return of long-lost Nicholas made national headlines). Most of the movie consists of interviews with the principals (the imposter himself, several of the family members, etc.) and there are also ""FBI Most Wanted""-like re-enactments of some pivotal scenes.

I see over 100 movies per year in the theatre, and I can tell you right here and now that this is one of the best movies I've seen this year, period. It's also why I love a top-notch documentary so much: you can't make this stuff up! Just riveting. Kudos obviously to director Bart Layton and producer Dimitri Doganis for bringing this slice of life to the big screen as it will exceed all of your wildest expectations. ""The Imposter"" is not only highly recommended, it is a MUST-SEE movie. You will thank me later for this recommendation!",1350086400,52,2273,4.527980535279806
5273762,4,B0096MJH2K,"""Imposter"" is right: for large periods in Bart Layton's new documentary you really have no idea who is taking you for a ride.

It could be Frdric Bourdin, it could be his adopted family, it could even be Bart Layton: The idea that an Algerian French 23 year old in the western Pyrenees could even conceive of impersonating a missing Texan teenager (and a blond haired, blue eyed teenager at that), let alone get as far as America and even to survive in the boy's family for five months is so outlandish that I supposed at first it must be a spoof.

But, as usual, truth is stranger than fiction. Here there are plenty of competing truths to choose from, among them Layton's: the director knowingly hangs his documentary around a long interview with Bourdin, the titular imposter: surely the last person you'd ask if you wanted to get to the bottom of the story. Not that Bourdin is any less than thoroughly engaging and charismatic. His recounting of events is brilliant and fascinating, and Layton constructs his story in such a way to ensure there are no doubts: we are compelled. The means by which Bourdin constructed his plan is quite ingenious. It involved the misdirection of a magician and conjuring tricks that a neuro-linguistic programmer might be proud to call his own. I wonder what Derren Brown would make of it.

Bourdin's recollections are intercut with interviews with various members of the Barclay family and the American officials who handled Frederic's ""repatriation"". Now it would be easy to put this down to American idiocy. But it's simply too confounding for that: The degree of credulity required of so many people transcends individual incompetence and asks deeper questions of our operation as social organisms. Are we simply wired, biologically, to fall for this sort of thing? How else could anyone believe for a moment that a hirsuit, olive-skinned, heavily accented Mediterranean man might be a fair-skinned American boy?

Still, there's a marked tension in early sequences: we are presented with a likeable, engaging, mercurial man, whom we know to be the villain. His cuckolds are credulous back-country folk and gullible law enforcement agents for whom it is hard to have any sympathy beyond a patronising one for their stupidity. As we watch, this feels a cruel and unfair conclusion to draw.

Our unease is resolved midway through, by the introduction of local sleuth Charlie Parker. He's a gem: a San Antonio private dick, appointed by a TV network to look behind the story of how this wonderful miracle really happened. But for the fact he must be 80 years old, he could have stepped out of a Raymond Chandler novel. Charlie gets a whiff of something, and he's off.

This individual? Patrick Barclay? Charlie's having none of it.

In a diner, over a plate of egg and fries, he conspirationally reveals facts that no-one else seems to have noticed (but which are head-slappingly obvious to us): his eyes are a different colour! And his ears are a different shape! Charlie read somewhere that that's how they caught James Earl Ray, so he matches the ears on PhotoShop. Charlie's a hoot, and he steals the second act.

Parker is also the instrument by which Layton's drama takes a brilliant turn: Charlie forms an additional hypothesis, which also seems blindingly obvious on hindsight, but this time not even we have thought of it: the family must have known this was not their son. Why else would a mother knowingly take a cuckoo into her nest? Charlie smells a rat. We watch, and we really hope he's found one, just for Charlie's sake.

The Imposter is a superb piece of entertainment. It's beautifully photographed: every frame, even of the interview segments, is set up carefully and richly coloured, and cinematographers Lynda Hall and Erik Wilson capture both the beauty and the hokiness of midwest America crisply. If there's a false step it's in the payoff, which can't quite deliver on the promise of the set-up:

But real life has a habit of refusing to follow the script.

5273763,5,B0096MJH2K,A movie you have to see to believe and then you're not sure.  The director does not leave the audience with any absolutes as the story unfolds as new details are discovered.  Don't want to ruin the fun and say too much.,1448236800,,219,4.190476190476191
5273764,5,B0096MJH2K,"If you have kids, imagine one of the worst things happening to them- they go missing. You go days, weeks, months without seeing them, without there being any sign of them still being alive. Years go by, still nothing. But one day, you get word that your child has been found. No matter how much time may have passed, youd recognize if it was really them or not, wouldnt you? Birth marks, scars, moles, there are a lot of little things that youd know and look for if they suddenly came back into your life. Now lets say they come back, and their eye and hair color are different. Wouldnt you question anything about this reunion? I heard about The Imposter while listening to The Fighter and the Kid podcast when comedian Bryan Callen was talking about good documentaries. Truth be told, he essentially revealed the whole plot in just a few minutes, but it sounded so crazy that I didn't care and still wanted to watch it. Even essentially knowing all of what happened, I was still blown away.

Frederic Bourdin always wanted to be someone else. We start out the film by learning about how he dressed up like a teenager and was taken in by the police in Spain. Without any identification, and not saying much to the police, they didn't have many options on what they could do with him. For some reason, they allowed him to stay in the building overnight, and left alone, he started to contact police stations in the United States. He told them that he was an officer in Spain and that they had located a person (himself), and gave a vague description, asking if they had anyone missing that matched the information. The person they thought was a match was Nicholas Barclay, a white, blonde haired, blue eyed teenager from Texas. Bourdin said that it was him, and they began to get things going to have him transferred to the US. When they faxed over the missing person poster to Bourdin, he knew he was in trouble. Bourdin had dark eyes, semi-dark skin, black hair and stubble on his face. Nicholas also had tattoos on his hands. Bourdin did everything he could to look like Nicholas, including bleaching his hair, hiding his eyes by wearing a hat, and getting the same tattoos. When he went to meet the missing boys family, they took him in.

They didn't question anything.

Obviously, they found out eventually, because Bourdin is right there in the documentary, going over every part of his plan and what happened leading up to the impersonation and when he arrived in Texas. But you don't have to spend more than a second thinking about it to realize how dumb it would be to really believe that this guy is Nicholas just a few years after he went missing. When interviewed by the authorities, Bourdin gives a long, planned story about how he and some other boys were taken in by military personnel and used for sex and other things. They forced them to learn Spanish, put some kind of chemical in their eyes that changed the color, and more. It was such an elaborate story that everyone fell for it. It takes some time, but thanks to a private investigator with a good eye, Bourdin is busted. It turns out that hes been doing this for a very long time, and has an insane amount of identities hes stolen.

Thats not the crazy part though. If you don't want the big surprise regarding this case ruined, just skip this paragraph altogether. So, it turns out that there was a good reason why Nicholas family accepted Bourdin and went along with it for as long as they did. There is strong evidence to support the claim that they were responsible for Nicholas disappearance, and its hinted at that they killed him. The family had problems that were well-known through the neighborhood. Nicholas mom managed to pass a lie detector test when she was asked about his disappearance. One of the investigators couldn't figure out how she passed so cleanly, and had her take it again. She passed the second time. But on the third time, she bombed and completely failed the test. How could you fail a third time when you passed the first two times so easily? What would there be to get worked up about if you were being honest? The same private investigator that spotted what would be the key thing in revealing Bourdin, set out to search the home Nicholas lived in, because theres a possibility that he was buried in the back yard.

The Imposter lives up to all the hype, using interviews with Nicholas family, Bourdin, people involved in the case, and using reenactments to make it a little more suspenseful. If you don't like documentaries much but watch a lot of those cop shows that are a dime a dozen these days, you should definitely watch it. Its one of those good examples of how fact is stranger than fiction.",1448064000,,4709,4.554899645808737

5273787,5,B0096MJH2K,"Anyone who says that this movie was not worth watching has no idea what they are talking about! It is such a creepy, disturbing, unbelievable, incomprehensible, tragic, mysterious and heart breaking true story. I was glued to the TV the entire time, I was so shocked at the insanity and the characters behavior that I had to watch it twice just to make sure I didn't miss anything. it is. If you want to watch a true sociopath in action then you must watch this film. Maybe the way the movie was filmed wasn't high budget or particularly aesthetically pleasing. But the grittiness and the footage that the film maker caught was sheer genius. Why no one else has ever made a documentary film about this story is a mystery to me. I am going to always going to be interested in this police case and the characters involved. I wish there was more information about this story for me to know so I could try to figure out what happened and why. I felt repelled and yet I couldn't stop watching it. I found myself getting angry and disgusted by what I was seeing and I also felt heartbroken and empathetic at times as well. It's a movie I would suggest to any adult or teenager to watch. A great study on human behavior and our attitudes towards people living in poverty. It's unfortunately not a happy story. It doesn't have a ending that gives you resolution, the case hasn't been given the attention it should be getting by the police or FBI so you will feel frustrated with that as well. I am giving it five stars  because I am a movie snob, sociopaths fascinate me, our belief systems in America are negative towards poverty and it upsets me and lastly because the people involved are not what they seem at all. You will find yourself confused and upset which makes you want to watch it even more closely so you can try to figure out why.  I am not a articulate movie critic but I do know a great story when I see one.",1407110400,4,1916,4.364145658263305
5273788,2,B0096MJH2K,"What the heck was going on here? A documentary with some major re-enactments? An absurd fictional tale that defies comprehension? It just makes no sense. And I was whoppingly disappointed in the director's plan. Create a character who seems damaged and vulnerable and gradually reveal him to be a chronic liar, at which point his sad tales about his youth become, well, mighty suspect. Dealing with liars is not fun in real life, as you can't be sure that ""I had pizza for lunch"" is a true statement. But in a movie? By the end, I said, ""Who cares? I feel manipulated and baffled and not remotely interested""

And others have said, the ending is not just abrupt, it is as if they showed up one day and said, ""Well, this is it--last day."" How this narcissist managed to get married and have children could possibly make an interesting tale. How the detective resolved his issues would also be worth watching; he was clearly a guy used to investigating petty thieves and adulterous wives who felt he had a major case on his hands and was excited. Why he was digging in that yard without the FBI along would make a fascinating tidbit. But not here. Just another confusing fact that went nowhere.

Briefly engaging, but ultimately a film as deceitful as its protagonist, and despite the praise here and on the cover, one that will be forgotten by me in a few weeks. I couldn't buy it at all. The fact that no one ever said, ""The boy who left here was a gritty Texan kid who was not thriving, and he became a heavily accented multi-lingual man in three years of abuse. How?"" is just flabbergasting. No matter how much anyone wanted to believe anything?",1401321600,,1647,4.542087542087542

5273791,5,B0096MJH2K,"The title of Bart Layton's ""The Imposter"" tells us up front: the young man with a French accent who turns up at a Spanish juvenile shelter in 1997 is not Nicholas Barclay, a 13=year-old boy who disappeared from his home town of San Antonio, Texas, three years before. It is the full measure of the skill of Layton and his filmmaking team that this knowledge spoils nothing of what is to come.

Questions remain, of course: Who is this young man, really? Why did Nicholas' family welcome him with open arms when he was so obviously not Nicholas? And--most compelling of all--what really happened to Nicholas? We get a definite answer to the first question, and a partial answer to the second. As for the third...

""The Imposter"" is a marvel of pacing, photography and editing, combining interviews, home movies and archival news footage with re-enactments by actors who are remarkable body doubles for the actual people. The twists and turns of the story, and the real-life characters in it, are so compelling that they seem like something Raymond Chandler, Elmore Leonard and Alfred Hitchcock would have spent their first thousand years in the afterlife dreaming up.

It's very well shot and interspersing it all with the real people involved in the most bizarre case of identity theft and manipulation was genius.

Look, I won't ruin the movie for anyone but telling you anything about it. Let's just say that once you see the protagonist you wonder how he could have passed himself off as someone who he looks nothing like UNTIL you hear him speak. The man is very charismatically calculating.

The extra is over 40 minutes of how this British team put it all together and focuses mainly on the research in tracking down the people involved in this case. Well worth watching after you're done with the movie.",1371859200,,911,4.58282208588957

Director Bart Layton does an excellent job, even to the extent of using the actual perpetrator, Frederic Bourdin in many of the staged scenes.  The boy's family, inexplicably recognize Bourdin as the kid, even though he would have only been 16 and never had a French accent.  It's a real head scratcher.  But Bourdin even fooled American and Spanish government officials on both sides of the Atlantic.

Only after a private detective, preparing some background for a TV show, concluded something was fishy.  Was the family involved in his disappearance?

The documentary focuses more on the why and how and leaves you with more questions and confusion. Why would someone who is 23 want to assume the identity of a teenage boy seven years his junior? How does he know that Nicholas disappeared and what does he know about his disappearing. The most jaw dropping situation was his ability to fool the boys family and their total acceptance of this stranger as Nicholas, why would they do that? or was there any other reason for their acceptance? These questions dominate the documentary.......It is clear from the beginning that Frederic Bourdin is the lying con artist but he was convincing to fool the US state department and the entire Barclay family. They fly to Texas and hope to have a normal life but his hopes of normalcy are dashed because his con is exposed.
Bourdin is a cocky and self assured man with an air of nonchalance, he narrates the story and tell us how he made the entire story up.
The most fascinating and disturbing part of this tale, is how the family or their kin were not able to sense that his man was a crook or if they knew - he was not then why were they able to accept Bourdain so easily. The con would have been executed perfectly had it not been for Charlie Parker who noticed the difference in the size of ears in Bourdain and Nicholass.

5273839,5,B0096MJH2K,"Truth is infinitely, infinitely stranger then fiction.

And nowhere is this more true then in the case of Nicholas Barclay and Frdric Bourdin. It is one of the strangest tales in the true-crime alley, a chilling story of deceit, lies, family secrets, and murder.

Nicholas Barclay, a blonde-haired, blue eyed boy of 13, disappeared from San Antonion, Texas, on June 13th, 1994. For 3 years his family never saw him, until they were informed that he had turned up in Spain. His story was a horrific account of an international military child prostitution ring. He related how his eyes were dyed brown with a solution, and how he was beaten, and finally escaped.
It was so chilling that it had to be true. But slowly, people began to notice things. The new Nicolas spoke with a French accent. He had brown eyes, brown hair. His ears were different.

Of course, this was not Nicolas Barclay, and everything he said was a lie. This was an imposter. A brilliant one.

Told brilliantly, artfully, and with mesmerizing style by director Bart Layton, The Imposter is as thrilling, suspenseful, and chilling as any Hollywood thriller. The reenactments are entertaining and artful, the interviews well staged and intruiging, the characters each as colorful and riveting as those of Thomas Harris and David Fincher. We are absolutely riveted and entranced as see the real Frdric Bourdin onscreen. Our inner selves tell us he is a criminal and a liar, and one of the worst sort - the ones who play on peoples emotions and feelings, but we still cannot look away.

 There have been good thrillers in 2012, and good documentaries, but the best is perhaps The Imposter. Tense, cerebral, psychological, gripping, suspenseful, venomous, thought-provoking, and mysterious, The Imposter is a must watch for fans of true crime, thrillers, and just plain amazing cinema!",1363824000,,1849,4.967637540453074

5273873,5,B0096MJH2K,"When director Bart Layton and producer Dimitri Doganis were searching for a subject for their first feature documentary, having previously collaborated on television documentaries in the UK, they found a story begging to be told in San Antonio, Texas. In 1994, 13-year-old Nicholas Barclay disappeared while walking home from a basketball court. Three years and four months later, a man claiming to be the missing Texan turned up at a youth shelter in Linares, Spain. He looked older than 16 years, had a shadow of a dark beard, while Nicholas Barclay had been blond, spoke with a French accent, and told tales of being abducted by a paramilitary group and forced into sexual slavery. But Barclay's family in Texas was notified, and Nicholas' sister Carey Gibson flew to Spain to meet the man claiming to be her brother. And she insisted that he was, in fact, her long-lost brother.

If things weren't weird enough already, they began to get weirder. ""The Imposter"" uses a combination of interviews and re-enactments to tell this strange story. Too strange to make up. The audience knows from the beginning that the man claiming to be the missing Nicholas Barclay was someone else, because he recounts the story from his point of view through interviews. Likewise, Nicholas' family -sister Carey Gibson, brother-in-law Bryan Gibson, mother Beverly Dollarhide- tell their side of the story. Eventually, FBI Special Agent Nancy B. Fisher and private investigator Charlie Parker became involved, and they offer their perspectives. Bart Layton intersperses re-enactments with the interviews. Two decades after Errol Morris introduced the use of re-enactments to documentary film in ""The Thin Blue Line"" (1988), ""The Imposter"" takes this to a new level.

These are the most cinematic re-enactments I've seen in a documentary, probably because the director of photography, Erik Wilson, has done some Hollywood movies. Much credit is also due to Andrew Hulme's editing. The re-enactments are abstract and short enough that they never overpower the story being recounted by those who lived it. And they are not speculative, which can be problematic in documentary. The back and forth between different perspectives is masterful, as is the way in which they are tied into the re-enactments. Halfway through, the film changes course, and the plot thickens. I don't know how much input Bart Layton had into the editing beyond the film's basic structure, but the editing makes this film more than anything else does. Lest I forget Frdric Bourdin, he could always tell a good story, and he does so here.

The DVD (Vivendi Entertainment 2013): There is a theatrical trailer (2  min) and a featurette. ""Making The Imposter"" (41 min) interviews director Bart Layton and producer Dmitri Doganis about how they learned of the story and came to make this film and about presenting different perspectives on the same series of events. A number of executive producers share their experiences with the project. Producer Poppy Dixon talks about her trip to the United States to research the story and track down the individuals involved. Cinematographer Erik Wilson, editor Andrew Hulme, and composer Ann Nikitin talk about their contributions. There are no subtitles available for the film.",1360627200,3,3268,5.195445920303605

And it wasn't the fact that the cast weren't all A listers. It was something else. A suspicion that the storyline might be a bit farfetched and difficult to pull off. My suspicions proved correct. The film is based on a true story (I'm not sure how fictionalized the movie was) and is really nothing more than an assemblage of interviews of this boy's family, law enforcement community, child protective reps, and the imposter himself. The interviews worked well enough, although in hearing each family member's accounting you doubt his/her sincerity or maybe intelligence, and it increasingly seems unlikely that they were fooled, so clueless, heartless, or even as gently suggested, complicit in the ruse.

5273899,2,B0096MJH2K,"I screened ""Compliance"" awhile back, a movie that I really liked but haven't yet reviewed.  While watching this film I thought of that film.  You might be tempted to say, ""That's odd,"" but in reality, it's not.  Both of these films have some striking similarities.

For example, both movies show very deviant people using social engineering to get something they want from others, and both movies also show victims who are extremely gullible falling into a trap.  You might be tempted to even use the word ""stupid""  with regards to those victims, and I wouldn't really object.  For me, I have one immutable rule:  I will never do anything that I'm just not comfortable doing, and the victims in both of these films seemed to not live by that same rule.  (It could be argued that the family in this film wanted their son back so bad that they couldn't be objective, but that is an argument for another day.)

But there are some stark differences as well.  ""Compliance"" is a reenactment and a drama -- almost a thriller perhaps -- while ""Imposter"" seems to be a documentary.  Going in, I had no idea that this was a documentary, and I have to admit, I was somewhat disappointed.  In reality, I just wasn't much in the mood to sit for an hour and a half and listen to some possible sociopath discuss -- while smirking, nonetheless -- how he took advantage of a family that had already endured enough.  But simultaneously, I didn't have much empathy for the family in this film either, while I felt extreme empathy and outrage for the main character in ""Compliance.""

Why do people allow themselves to be suckered in so often?  It sure seems that way, after watching a couple of films, one that I really liked, and one that I really didn't.  But you don't have to be the next victim.  Don't be suckered into putting this film onto your Wish List, as this would be a pass.",1359504000,3,1867,4.522388059701493

Bourdin's greatest con brought him in 1997 to America and to a traumatized family in San Antonio, Texas, who welcomed the 23-year-old interloper into their home as their long-lost son, Nicholas Barclay, a boy who vanished one day in 1994 when he was 13.

The mother of all stranger-than-fiction yarns, Bourdin's Texas con is meticulously retold in director Bart Layton's gripping, hair-raising documentary The Imposter.

Layton turns up the weird by having Bourdin, the most unreliable of unreliable narrators, recount his story for us. Clever dramatic reconstructions featuring a look-alike actor add to the realist faux-reality.

Bourdin gets under your skin.

""For as long as I remember, I wanted to be someone else. Someone who was acceptable,"" he says. ""Nobody ever gave me a childhood, because to give a kid a childhood you need to love that kid.""

Finding himself in Linares, Spain, in 1997, Bourdin decides to seek shelter at an orphanage. Grilled by the authorities, he lets out that he's American. So begins the con.

A resourceful manipulator and a great storyteller, Bourdin recounts how he called the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children in Virginia to find a missing boy whose identity he could steal.

He picks Nicholas, despite their age difference.

To our astonishment, Nicholas' family immediately accepts Bourdin as their beloved child. No matter that Bourdin is a dark-haired, brown-eyed, olive-skinned adult with dark stubble, while Nicholas was a blue-eyed, blond child with pale skin.

Everyone buys the lie, including the Spanish authorities, the U.S. Embassy in Madrid, and the FBI agent assigned to track down Nicholas' supposed abductors. (Bourdin claims he had been kidnapped by an international sex slavery ring. )

If The Imposter provides a measure of insight into Bourdin's pathology - he was the unwanted child of a 17-year-old French girl and an older Algerian man - it provides a searing, laser-sharp emotional portrait of Nicholas' family, including his mother, Beverly Dollarhide, and his sister Carey Gibson.

Both refuse to accept the FBI's later findings that Bourdin is a fraud - his fingerprints yield a thick Interpol file detailing his previous scams. It's unnerving to learn that he always impersonates children.

The Imposter shows how our beliefs, our sense of truth, are more often shaped by our desires - for love, affection, revenge, closure - than by the facts.

The film leaves us with a nagging question: Is Bourdin lying to gain our sympathy when he tells about his own traumatic, loveless childhood?

Layton's dazzling film is an exciting, edge-of-your-seat experience superior to any Hollywood mystery you're likely to see for a long time.",1474588800,,3022,5.18724279835391
8536755,5,B0096MJH2K,YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS!  This was awesome. I love a twist. This has an amazing Twist!!!,1466294400,,87,4.117647058823529
8536756,5,B0096MJH2K,"Compelling right from the start. I love the ""dubbing"" done by the imposter in lots of the scenes. Fascinating to watch the body language of the family members once the major twist in the movie occurs. Fascinating again when we find out more of the imposter's real history. Most documentaries feel like documentaries, and that's okay. But this is one of the top 3 documentaries that feel like regular feature-length movies: The Times of Harvey Milk, Tabloid, and The Imposter. Worth seeing for the film technique alone, much less the incredible story.",1459036800,,550,4.989130434782608

8536759,5,B0096MJH2K,"How could his family mistake their all-american, blonde, blue-eyed son for this Spaniard, brown eyed, older man with such a heavy accent? The boy had only been missing for 3 years. Part of me feels like they wanted him back so bad that they just overlooked the fact that he looked NOTHING like Nicholas BUT the other part of me says there has to be more to it. Did his family kill him? The sister was giving him all the answers to questions so it would seem like he was Nicholas. Why wasn't DNA, fingerprints or something done to confirm his identity before he was given a a passport and allowed to enter the USA? That's really confusing. Someone dropped the ball on this, were there no dental records? This man should have been held until they could confirm his identity or rule out that he was any one else. He looked nothing like Nicholas! Mind-boggling!",1452211200,,857,4.5
