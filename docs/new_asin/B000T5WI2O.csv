This is a wonderful distraction for people who are depressed, sad, in pain, bed bound and for those who miss going out doors. I suggest it to all Hospice workers everywhere!!!",1191024000,3,340,4.590163934426229
2895010,5,B000T5WI2O,"Back to nature and the simpler things in life
I bought this dvd in the hopes of having something other than the tv playing and hooping it would be relaxing and engaging at the same time.  This is not a dvd for everyone, but it is good for many people of all ages.  I find it relaxing and calming when working on many daily things.  I like nature a lot of people do.  This film has a lot of nice relaxing sounds of nature, a lot of scenery, and animals.  Sometimes it seems that you are there doing the filming or viewing things in person.  The dvd is not a movie as most would think but a relaxing extension of mother nature.  This is good to have playing while you are working on different projects and need something calming and not distracting. Im sure this would be good to have playing when children are playing games rather than having them glued to the tv all the time.  Also, this would be especially good for soothing babies and give them something educational at the same time, most all children love animals.  I like that it just continues on without having to restart it all the time or you can pick and choose which section you want to listen to or watch.  It is nice to have something you can look at when you want to and have beautiful scenery to look at.  This is great for families to have running in the background when they are doing other things such as playing board games together.  I think this would be great to have playing in day cares, waiting rooms, nursing homes and hospitals for people to watch and listen to for the soothing quality alone.  I enjoy myself and hope that others will enjoy the peace and tranquility it brings to our hectic lives.  I hope this review is a bit helpful.

2895011,5,B000T5WI2O,"As a nature lover, I was excited to try out the XapVision Nature Scenes DVD. It contains almost a full three hours of clear, well recorded nature scenes from all kinds of different locations. These include what look like they could be zoos, so not everything is in its natural habitat, but it isn't obvious from the shot. Each scene is under a minute long before it transitions to the next clip. I personally think some of the transitions looked a little tacky, like they were from a power point presentation, but none of them were bad. I think this would be the perfect DVD to play in waiting rooms, as the background music and noises are quiet and not obnoxious. And it really is entertaining to watch! My kids especially enjoyed trying to name all of the different animals and would discuss what they thought the animals were doing.

One thing that was surprised me was how the DVD plays, which would also make it great for a business to use. The DVD is divided into eight different segments ND when you put the DVD in the player, it will automatically play the segments in random order unless you go to settings have have it do otherwise. Overall, we really enjoyed watching this, and will continue to use it in the future. We will most likely watch this when trying to keep a quiet atmosphere in the house, but also get some quiet entertainment, such as when children aren't feeling well.

What I Like about this DVD of Nature Scenes
1. The videography is exquisite. The closeups are so intense, you feel like you're right there with the animals, flowers, clouds. For instance, you could see the giant frog breathing through his nostrils, a small ant traipsing across the face of a giant bird. I was mesmerized and couldn't stop watching!
2. This video is so stress-relieving. I don't know how they managed it, but the viewer feels transported into nature and lulled by its tranquility.
3. This would be a wonderful video to help someone who's been bed-ridden or in the hospital for a number of days and needs a dose of the outdoors, but can't get it in real life.
4. This video would be great for a classroom teacher to play while kids are chilling after an intense cerebral activity.

I was given this nature scenes DVD free for testing and review purposes. It's absolutely brilliant. I've taught school for 17 years, and I've seen nothing to compare with this video. It's pure artisty. The sounds, the wildlife - all of it together make you feel like you've really experienced the wildlife event. Spectacular! If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would!",1468368000,,1233,4.67741935483871
2895013,5,B000T5WI2O,"I got this DVD for an elderly lady I care for who has Alzheimers. She tends to get agitated in the late afternoons and evenings, so I was looking for something that would be both soothing and entertaining for her. I used a similar DVD years ago for my mother and it was absolutely invaluable, so I hoped that this lady would also benefit from it. Ill say right up front that I don't think this DVD was intended for the average adult to just sit and watch like a movie. However, I do enjoy it as a relaxing background while Im working, and Id find myself captivated by it if I were sitting in a waiting room. The ideal audience, in my opinion, would be children, elderly dementia patients, and the developmentally disabled. So, Ive given it 5 stars with that target audience in mind.

The DVD has four programs/sections, with the option to play all or to play each program individually. Theres also the option to play randomly. Program 1 is Summer Variety, program 2 is The Fall Colors, program 3 is More Exotic Animals, and program 4 is Ultimate Virtual Aquarium. Theres almost 3 hours of play. I attached a few photos so you can get a general idea of what to expect. Since I was taking photos of a video playing on my TV, there were many things that I just couldn't capture due to motion and resolution. Theres a fair array of animals, with your run-of-the-mill cats, dogs, horses, cows, ducks and geese. But also peacocks, beaver, deer, rabbits, parrots, fox, turtles, and seals. Theres also underwater life with a lot of different fish, octopus, manta ray, turtles, sea horses, and jelly fish. In addition, there are a lot of natural scenes with greenery and changing leaves, as well as colorful flowers. Also included are sped-up scenes of changing cloud formations. The only background sounds are natural  birds singing, crickets chirping, water flowing, etc.

The lady I care for will sit for hours staring at the changing scenes in the DVD. It keeps her fairly calm and relaxed. She always smiles at the puppies and cats. This would work great in a nursing home or a doctor or hospital waiting room. I can also see it used in a daycare setting for relaxation time. The videographer did a nice job in offering variety, with just the right amount of time between transitions.

A complimentary DVD was provided to me for evaluation purposes, but I was under no obligation to give a favorable review.",1468108800,,2403,4.607476635514018
2895014,5,B000T5WI2O,My children and I enjoyed watching this lovely DVD.  It is actually quite long and we watched it in three hour segments.  It plays in it's own twenty minute segments that autoplay.  I didn't watch it the day I received it but turned it on a few days later when it was raining outside and kind of dark and gloomy in the house.  I always try to think of different ways to bring back sparks of joy into my children's lives when they have moments of feeling down.  We laughed and smiled and talked about all of the animals and plants that we saw.  They even rewound it a few times to catch moments that happened quickly.  We noticed that the ducks where this was filmed have different feather patterns than our ducks in the state we live in.  I've actually never seen ducks like the ones in this film on t.v. or in books. It was really kind of neat to see as the trees and water are so similar to the ones here that at first we thought it was the Northwest until we saw the different creatures.  There are black squirrels running up and down trees and my son said he had read about them in a book. I was surprised that they existed.  I loved seeing the bullfrogs up close and hearing them sing.  The gentleman filming everything isn't seen or heard.  He just goes to different areas and films creatures in their natural habitat and even catches pets at play. He pans in and out with his handheld professional camcorder.  It really is a more simple movie and I think that that adds to the charm.  A lot of it is filmed in an aquarium.  I'd thought to myself that I could just go visit an aquarium at the coast and than I realized it has been years since I've been there and we have no plans of going back anytime soon since as my husband is always working so much but there I was seeing all of these amazing fish and sea anemones right in my home with my children.  We talked so much about them and the kids asked a bunch of questions.  There was even what they called a blue Dory fish and some Marlin/Nemo fishes.  The sea horses were too fun to watch and my eldest daughter just loved the moments where the horses were galloping together.  It was a beautiful sight. Product purchased at a discount.  This is my honest review.  There is also a moment where he simply films a small aquarium in a home.  Seeing and hearing the bubbling reminded me of when I was age seven and had my own aquarium.  I used to turn of all of the lights except for the little aquarium's light and then I'd put an afghan over my Mom and I and we'd cuddles and watch and listen. I was so happy to see this again.  I definitely recommend this movie for someone that loves nature and beautiful things.  We need to sit back and just experience the true world as how it was intended to be. Pure beatiful nature!  Please see my photo for an example of our XapVision nature scenes DVD movie.  Thanks!,1468108800,,2866,4.220588235294118
2895015,5,B000T5WI2O,"This DVD included many nature scenes, but did not have the commentary or music that many nature DVDs have. It is a nice DVD that is relaxing and soothes the mind. Plus it basically is three hours of the great outdoors. I have anxiety and it really helped me relax after a long day of work. It does come with a QuickStart guide that does mention that the DVD footage is cut up into eight sections, the DVD automatically plays the eight sections in a random order. This makes it a sort of unique experience whenever you pop the DVD into the DVD player. I really recommend this for kids, I'm sure they will love it! I also would recommend this for anyone who is bedridden and wants to get a glimpse into the great outdoors.

2895016,5,B000T5WI2O,"This review is for XapVision Nautre Scenes DVD. This DVD arrived sealed. This DVD is over 3 hours long. The scenes are quite vivid. The colors in this DVD are great. This DVD does not have any narration, music or weird interruptions. Just 3 hours of great nature scenes. I put this on in my living room and all of my cats came and started to watch. They sat mesmerized! The cats watched this the entire time. This is just a very nice dvd to watch to wind down. It would be great in a nursing home or senior facility. You have several choices: animals, coral reef fish tank, spring flowers, summer breezes, autumn foliage and winter snow melts. The scenes are spectacular. The colors are bright and it almost like you are right there.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone looking for some nice relaxation. I'm sure kids would love the animals.

2895017,2,B000T5WI2O,I really liked the fish scenes but there were too many scenes of domestic cats. One scene was a cat in someone's house!!!  Not nature scenes by any means!,1238371200,2,154,4.310344827586207

2895019,5,B000T5WI2O,"The nature scenes presented here are so vivid, you will feel like you are outdoors enjoying the scenery!  This DVD is flawlessly produced, such that the images glide gracefully from one scene to another in a relaxed, unhurried manner.  The only sounds you hear are those of nature -- the songbirds singing, the pounding of the horses' hooves on the grassy meadows, the rustling of the wind in the trees!  Combine those sounds with breathtaking scenery of brilliant colors, and you have a great product.  I have purchased this for my family and friends, as this DVD appeals to children, older adults, and everyone in between!  This can also be used as a stress-reliever in a waiting room for a doctor or dentist's office, in hospital or hospice rooms, or anytime you need to relax and take a break.

8207960,5,B000T5WI2O,"I bought this video about 5 years ago at a baby expo. Where I believe I met the man behind the camera.

This would be great for littles as background while they are playing or eating, but it's not very helpful for sleep and relaxation.

8207964,2,B000T5WI2O,"Although my 3 year old daughter enjoyed pointing out the animals, the DVD was very amateur and overpriced.  The film looks like it is full of homemade clips of someone's property....some horses running, new puppies, ducks on a pond, squirrels, etc.  I have seen many wildlife films, and this is the most unimpressed I've been.  I could have spent this money better elsewhere.  I could have easily taken these videos myself and watched it for free.  This DVD should be in the $1.00-$5.00 bin.",1483056000,,491,4.7976190476190474

8207968,5,B000T5WI2O,"By way of full disclosure, I know the videographer, who has made some surgical procedure (rhinoplasty) educational videos for me.  I have worked with many videographers over 38 year teaching career, and Lane Wyrick is exceptionally talented.  His skill as a photographer and his editing ability, counterpoised to his diffidence, is extraordinary in my experience.

Thus it does not surprise me at all that he could have created this DVD.  The patience that it must have taken to assemble hundreds of unique natural scenes and to capture animals, plants, and insects at just the right times seems extraordinary to me: many of us don't have that temperament.  The natural images, landscapes, seascapes, and sunsets and the way there are weaved together make a uniquely entertaining and inspiring three hours-- just moving images and their authentically beautiful sounds.  I sat with my 11-year-old granddaughter to watch it for the first time and after five minutes, Samantha said, ""I could watch this for three hours!""

Lane Wyrick previously produced ""A Friend Indeed:The Bill  Sackter Story.""  It is not at all surprising to me that the insightful man that could have produced such a wonderful documentary displays his abilities once more in a magnificent tribute to our natural world, uncluttered by music or narration.  Lane Wyrick has made another winner that children and adults will find calming and inspiring.  Reconnect with your world.",1470355200,2,1444,5.234782608695652
