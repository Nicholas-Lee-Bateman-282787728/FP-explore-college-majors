7859135,1,6304021828,"I will not go into the problems that plague this series for that is in my review in Masked Rider: Escape From Edenoi.  Instead, I will discuss what is wrong with this tape.

This two-part episode tells how Dex gained the powers of Masked Rider: Super Gold.  Count Drago developed experimental powers to use against the Masked Rider and tested it out on his best friend from Edenoi.  Dex contacts his Grandfather who then gives him these new powers to stop him...I think...or was it that his best friend was using the Super Gold powers to give to Dex in the first place...I'm not sure.  This two-parter was very difficult to follow through as, half the time, I couldn't follow what was going on!  Very Confusing!

Even worse is the idea that Dex had access to these powers, but didn't take it with him when he came to Earth in the first place!  I know that Saban was merely trying to make create use of Japanese clips loaned to them but they could have tried a little harder, plot wise.

The other matter is the ""special appearance"" by the Power Rangers.  It's really nothing more than re-aired clips that were originally shown on the Mighty Morphin' Power Ranger show months before.  It would have been cool for them to team up, but here, it just didn't happen.

At least the first tape was easier to follow through.",1126396800,,1316,4.506329113924051

It will be cool if Masked Rider join the Power Rangers to fight Lord Zedd!",1054857600,3,139,4.384615384615385
