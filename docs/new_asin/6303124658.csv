7839187,5,6303124658,Excellent follow-up to original movie. As good as the first.,1525392000,,60,5.1
7839188,3,6303124658,"The original Project A-ko contained several levels of plot: the grudge between A-ko and B-ko, Earth Defense Force's ineptitude, Lost Princess/Alien Invasion, making fun of other Anime.  Plot's major failing is that it has only two plots, neither of them very well thought out.  At least there's some semblance of continuity, and A-ko and B-ko do fight each other.  Other than that, it's hardly a Project A-ko movie.",1129248000,,415,5.073529411764706
