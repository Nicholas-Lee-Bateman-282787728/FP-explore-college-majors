He told me to wait in the car while he ran inside & that he would't be long. I started to play with the car radio when I heard a sound I never heard before. It was the drone of the crowd at a baseball game. Being 50 miles north of Philadelphia it was the Phillies game, although I had no idea who they were as a 7 tear old boy. I do remember the sound of the bat as Richie Ashburn fouled off pitch after pitch. It seemed like he was at the plate for 5 minutes. From that day on I was hooked, not only as an Ashburn fan ,but a lifelong Phillies fan. This dvd is a fascinating look back on Richie's life. I've watched it multiple times & enjoy it every time. A must for a Phillies fan, and a very enjoyable
story for any true baseball fan.",1391558400,,846,3.84

8252617,4,B0013PVGNQ,"Richie was one of my all time favorite announcers, and a Hall of Fame player, but he played before my time.  Learned a lot about his career, and great anecdotes like how he'd get free pizza delivered to him while he was on the air!",1359936000,,231,4.133333333333334

8252620,5,B0013PVGNQ,"I became a Phillies fan in 1950. Have stuck with them thru thick and thin, mostly thin, since. Richie was one of my first sports heroes. The DVD was excellent. I never knew much about his personal life...Harry Kalas was at his best. Great item for all sports fans. Harry Acker VA Beach.",1211414400,8,286,4.415094339622642
