I find it hard to believe that even those who like ""artsy erotic"" would enjoy this. constant panning of the camera & quick scene changes were very frustrating. Such as the young lovers on the beach, I was shown more of the beach, cliffs & waves than I was shown of the  characters, and then it was just quick shots too ""up close"" or
from too far away. Big disappointment!",1077840000,9,534,4.287128712871287
1080648,3,6305807876,"With the reputation Walerian Borowczyk (boroh-chick) had, I eagerly sprang to get this video ages ago.  I just saw it again and well,...  anyway, this quartet of stories features tales that are more exploitative in showing copious amounts of female genitalia rather than being immoral.
The Tide, based on a story by Andre Preyre de Mandiargues, is set in contemporary France (then 1975) about a twenty-year old man who seduces his sixteen year-old cousin Julie, on the beach, using his age difference to bend her to his will.  He is a bit of a bossy sort, and I was surprised to see her obey him meekly.  It's mostly talky, with some pompous dialogue of the using the rise of tides as analogous to his desire of her.  There's a nice close-up of Julie's lips and she looks nice in the altogether.  Even so... (Rating:  3 out of 5)
Therese the Philosopher is about a religiously devout French girl in 1890 who is wrongfully punished and is locked in a room for three days.  What happens in that room?  To quote words she heard from God while at church: ""Reveal yourself by showing your weakness, your sensuality, your pride, your craven, selfish indolence.""  And also, I'll never think of cucumbers the same way again.  As for the story, so what?  (Rating:  2.5 out of 5)
The next two stories are significantly better.  The third story, Erzebet Bathory, has the notorious Blood Countess going to a village to round up young girls for her dastardly pleasures, under the masquerade of granting eternal bliss and grace for those touching her pearl-encrusted gown.  This has about twenty or so girls in the altogether, and they go into a crazed frenzy when they see Bathory in her dress.  Does Bathory have a bath?  Find out for yourself (Rating:  4 out of 5)
The fourth story, set in 1498 Florence, would probably be considered immoral, as it involves Lucrezia Borgia having a threesome with Pope Alexander VI (her father Rodrigo) and a cardinal (her brother Cesare) while they send her impotent simp of an uptight husband, Giovanni Sforza away.  Meanwhile, monk Hieronymous Savonarola rails against the immorality of the church, of priests openly displaying their sons, until he is captured and becomes Dominican barbeque.  (Rating:  4 out of 5)
I think this quartet tried to subtly shock given the theme in each one.  It doesn't do so effectively.  However, for the sake of showing several nubile girls full frontal, I suppose this is more a curio than anything.  Slow moving and more sensationalistic and exploitative than shocking.  (Overall rating:  (3+2.5+4+4)/4=3",1057017600,40,2565,4.852534562211981
1080649,3,6305807876,"I believe it has been mentioned that this film, while an adequate entry in its genre, does not quite deliver the goods. This is profoundly accurate, and describes the film to a T. The director--I'm not even going to bother trying to spell his name from memory--has proven that he CAN deliver the goods (a la ""The Beast""), but here his stories fall short of the money shot, as it were. It gives one a case of what I call ""mental blue balls"": The copious nudity and gynocological close-ups are here, but that is it. Where a full-on sex scene would have brought each story to its logical conclusion, we are left hanging with an ""after the fact"" sort of setting.
  The implied oral in the first vignette is seen fleetingly, and from a distance at times, and ultimately comes off as forgettable; the vegetarian delight in the second act is understandably made low key, so that's forgivable; the third act is loaded with skin, but the Countess and her assistant's seduction scene never even got started, and would have been perfect; and lastly the orgy with the pope and his kids is woefully down-played and short. It's almost as if the director had developed a conscience or something by that time. The girl in that act is outrageously sexy, and is on display quite a lot, but instead of the perfect sex scene--which would have been similar to the finale of ""the Beast"", but with a pope instead of a wolf or whatever--we get quick shots of basically nothing. All the action there seems to happen off-screen.
  This genre demanded better, and the director was capable of it, but for some reason kept pulling back at key moments which really reduced the overall value of the film, I think.
  It's interesting to note that ""La Bete"" was originally part of this series, but was withdrawn instead to have it's own full length feature. So I'm really left wondering ""WTF?"", since it fulfills its mission so much better than this one.",1052870400,18,1921,4.618768328445748
1080650,4,6305807876,"In the Lucretia Borgia short, I have noticed that several reviewers (here and on other web sites) referred to the orgy as being with a ""priest.""  Make no mistake, Lucretia is getting it on with her DAD (the Pope) and her BROTHER, after daddy has sent her husband off to be murdered!  These allegations were never proven in real life, but they make an amusing story.  The baby being baptized at the end is her offspring, presumably with her own father (the baby's father AND grandfather rolled into one!)
As far as the four stories tying together, one of the factors that connects them is the underwear.  They make a big point of showing historically authentic underwear, which should make this film interesting to costume enthusiasts as well as perverts.  Each one depicts (loosely) a real life story or series of events, each farther back in history.  As a music history major in college (way back when), I can tell you the music is also authentic -- anyone basically familiar with the pre-baroque repertoire will recognize several well-known performances.  The ""Hayaducki"" by Nikolai von Krakau was a delightful choice, as was the Machaut Mass for the papal orgy scene.
This film is not for the even vaguely prudish or squeamish, but if you can dig a real life lesbian ""vampire"" in a bathtub of blood, and an incestuous, murderous orgy with the Pope and his two kids, this is the film for you!!
Plus, Paloma Picasso has really beautiful eyes, which are prominently featured in several closeups.  Those shots alone, which were truncated in the VHS copy I've enjoyed these last 20 years, were enough to make me want to get the widescreen version in DVD.
Personally this is one of my all time fav's.",1051660800,46,1698,4.7322033898305085

THE TIDE: A young French couple talk philosophy and have sex on a beach. Pretentious and boring. Honestly, do you know anybody who gets randy talking about Plato and the like?
THERESE THE PHILOSOPHER: Oh no. More philosophical garbage, but in an unexpected twist, Therese strips naked and makes love to a courgette. Interesting, but like its predecessor, pretentious.
ERZSEBAT BATHORY: More self absorbed arty-farty twaddle in this tale of Countess Elizabeth Bathory and her lining up young virgins to have slaughtered for her blood bath. Lots of female nudity and a couple of good shower scenes but... blah.
LUCREZIA BORGA: A priest indulges his sexual fantasies, and the tale ends with him baptizing a baby for its unknowing parents. I guess this tale's trying to put some message across about how purity and sex are linked... but I'm not an intellectual so I'll leave that to some other reviewer. Was I shocked? No. Was I entertained? Bored? Yes. Really the only redeeming features are in my review: Gore, nudity & sex with vegetables. Whatever tickles your fancy, I guess.

THE FILM:

""Immoral Tales"" is a French anthology that tells four or five (depending on which version you watch) stories, each delving further back in time, as if to suggest that the same issues recur constantly throughout human civilization, whether involving notorious historical figures like Lucrezia Borgia and Erzsbet Bthory, or present-day teenagers. Capitalizing on the relaxation of censorship laws, ""Immoral Tales"" would transform Walerian Borowczyk's image from brilliant but obscure avant-garde artist to one of Europe's most confrontational filmmakers when it came to trampling on sexual taboos.

The Blu-ray and DVD Combo Pack contains two versions of the film. In the theatrical cut there are four stories, ""The Tide,"" ""Thrse Philosophe,"" ""Erzsebet Bathory,"" and ""Lucrezia Borgia."" In the original five-part conception also known as ""The L'age d'or cut,"" the short film ""La Bte"" AKA ""The True Story of the Beast of Gvaudan,"" that was later expanded into Borowczyks feature length film ""The Beast,"" is also included.

The Tide - This story involves 20 year old Andr (Fabrice Luchini) and his 16 year old cousin Julie (Lise Danvers). Andr demonstrates his control over Julie by continually giving her orders. He takes her to a secluded beach where he plans to make use of his lurid intentions. The sound of waves crashing is put to good use in this film as it coincides with the actions of the young couple. The cinematography is terrific with the countryside and ocean, both looking gorgeous.

Therese Philosophe - This tale is about young Therese (Charlotte Alexandra) who has been unjustly punished. She is to spend three days and three nights locked in her bedroom. But instead of contemplating her punishment, Therese's mind strays and she begins to have sexual fantasies involving objects in her bedroom. She eventually loses control and gives in to temptation. Unfortunately she later crosses paths with a vagrant who cannot control his urges when he sees Therese.

La Bte - This is the story of The Beast of Gvaudan, that is spreading fear in the Massif Central region of France. A young woman (Sirpa Lane) ventures in to the woods after her lamb and encounters the ferocious beast. After running through the never ending woods trying to escape the monster, the beast eventually catches up to its prey. However, the beast does not kill her. Instead, it proceeds to rape her. The story does not end as one might expect.

Erzsebet Bathory - Here we have a story about Countess Elisabeth Bathory (Paloma Picasso). The countess, along with her squire Istvan (Pascale Christophe) and a soldier, visit the villages and settlements of Nyitra County, Hungary. There, young virgin girls are rounded up, to be taken home with the countess. Once they arrive, the girls bathe one another and are left nude. Countess Bathory concocts a drink and serves it to the girls. What follows next is a mass of wild girls first pawing at the countess and then at one another with an eruption of violence and ultimately, betrayal.

Lucrezia Borgia - In this final tale of depravity, Lucrezia (Florence Bellamy) and her husband Giovanni Sforza travel to visit Lucrezia's father, Pope Alexander VI (Jacopo Berinizi) and her brother, Cesare (Lorenzo Berinizi). You will quickly learn that there is no love lost between Lucrezia's father and her husband. Following a nefarious deed, we see that Lucrezia, her father and brother, share a bit too much love for one another in the form of a mnage  trois. In the final scene of the film we see a baby, a product of incest, being baptized.

AUDIO:

This Blu-ray comes with one audio option, a French LPCM 2.0 Mono track. I thought the track was excellent. Whether it is the sounds of crashing waves, erotic moans or the accompanying score, the audio track does a wonderful job. Throughout the entire film, the balance of dialogue, score and sound effects remained very stable. I did not encounter any negative issues with the audio. Optional English subtitles are also included.

VIDEO:

""Immoral Tales"" comes to Blu-ray courtesy of a new high definition transfer thanks to Arrow Video. The film is presented in 1080p with a 1.66 Aspect Ratio. Some stories may look better than others, but the film looks outstanding. I thought the colors were rich and natural looking. Blood certainly has a crimson appearance. Skin tones look very natural from Julie's pink lips in ""The Tide"" to the milky white skin of the abducted girls in ""Erzsebet Bathory."" The amount of fine detail present in some of the close ups is amazing for a film over 40 years old. Black levels look fine as well. The grain looks great throughout the film. I did not notice any problems whatsoever with the video quality.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Introduction by Borowczyk expert Daniel Bird (5:14)

Love Reveals Itself (16:42) - Production manager Doninique Duverg-Sgrtin and camera operator Nol Vry discus the the films production. Nol Vry talks about using a special camera mount for Boroczyk's films and even gives a demonstration. The pair talk about the casting for the film, including the fact that Isabelle Adjani was approached for the role of Julie in ""The Tide,"" but she declined. There are some interesting details offered in this featurette. I was surprised to learn that the blood used in a certain scene, was real pigs blood. More surprising is that after the scene was shot, the blood was used to make black pudding. (In French with English subtitles)

Obscure Pleasures: A Portrait of Walerian Boroczyk (1:03:15) -  This is a newly edited archival interview with Walerian Boroczyk that was filmed for the UK's Channel Four ""Visions"" documentary strand in 1985, but never aired. Mr. Boroczyk discusses his interest and foray in to the field of animation. Periodically, snippets of animation are played during the interview. The conversation next shifts to sex in cinema during which, clips from various films are displayed. Walerian Boroczyk also talks about his interest in painting and makes a comparison to film-making. Fans of Boroczyk will most likely find this interview more interesting than I did, simply because other than this film, I am not very familiar with his work. He was very open and honest in this interview which anyone can appreciate. (In French with English subtitles)

Blow-Ups (4:43)  - Viewers are given a glimpse at some of Walerian Boroczyk's art, including his prize-winning lithographs and poster designs.

Trailer (2:18)

Reversible sleeve featuring Borowczyk's own original poster design

Illustrated booklet containing new writing on the film by Daniel Bird and an archive piece by Phillip Strick

IN CONCLUSION:

The subject matter of ""Immoral Tales from Arrow Video may not appeal to everyone, but this Blu-ray looks and sounds fantastic.  There are a number of good extras included as well. This release also contains a DVD for added value. Fans of Walerian Boroczyk or those interested in exploitation films should consider purchasing the film. Arrow Video has done a fine job and fans should be extremely pleased with this release.

1080754,4,6305807876,"Immoral Tales is a series of four (or five, depending on the version) pornographic shorts from director Walerian Borowczyk, known for his artful eroticism in film, lithography, and poster artwork. These works are split into time periods, starting from the most recent and working back to the 1400s with the Borgias and the Pope, and they tend to blend surrealism and erotica into a strange concoction that sometimes horrifies, offends, or titillates  perhaps all at the same time. Immoral Tales won the French Prix de Lage Dor in 1974; it didn't exactly put the film into the public eye, but it did award a softcore pornography with a fairly prestigious award for surrealism.

Borowczyks direction, and the stories he adapts, are often difficult, however. The four pieces of this anthology are simply reverse-chronologically ordered, starting from the basic present and heading deep into the past, exploring sexuality along the way. While Immoral Tales is, in general terms, an erotic film, it is also an intensely confrontational porno  most viewers watching the film won't be excited so much as desensitized by the constant parade of sex and female nudity, and Borowczyk has a tendency to focus on parts of the sex act that are less flattering. This is intentional, and often Immoral Tales plays with the viewers expectations of what an X-rated film should be.

It truly does offer up a few disconcerting images and situations. The first shorts story about two teen cousins trapped on a rock during high tide tackles both incest, defloration, and the power of older male influence over women. Despite its flashes of the lush lips of Julie (Lise Danvers), its also a tale thats pretty disgusting. The same is true for Therese Philosophe, about a woman locked in her room who finds a book of sexual illustrations and decides to use a cucumber as a masturbation device; Borowczyks female protagonist is beautiful, and her success at exploring her own sexuality despite prudish attempts to limit that is intriguing, but the direction of this piece often highlights things like squishy sounds, the breaking of cucumbers, and an unwavering close-up of skin.

Erzsebet Bathory takes a look at Countess Bathorys obsession with nubile female women, and it has a real bloodbath scene that nicely reenacts historical recounting of the character. At the same time, it is Borowczyk desensitizing the audience to nudity, with countless naked girls running around and showering throughout the elongated sequence. The Beast of Gevaudan, cut from the theatrical version and turned into a full-length film The Beast, circumvents the terror of beast-rape when the beasts victim winds up accidentally killing the beast after numerous ejaculations.

Finally, Lucrezia Borgia ends the film with a blasphemous threesome that finds her father (the Pope) and her brother sharing her in a church while another man recounting sins is burned at the stake. Borowczyk dabbles in humor, as well as a vilification of religion; at one point, Lucrezia is stretched out on a cross in a classic depiction of Jesus crucifixion.

But Immoral Tales is often dry and slow, and even though Borowczyk has surrealist intentions and metaphors for his porn shorts, it doesnt make it any more interesting to watch. Its difficult to recommend Immoral Tales to someone because it often defies any sort of classification; its not really erotic despite its numerous sex scenes, and its not really entertaining as a film despite Borowczyks attempts to graft meaning into each of the stories.

It leaves Immoral Tales a unique film, certainly, but also one that most audiences will have a hard time appreciating. If watched with an open mind, there are flashes of interesting premise; but the method Borowczyk employs to get there just doesnt make for a film viewers can sit down and watch, especially the extended version which runs about two hours. One interested in artful pornography should give this an attempt, but those looking for strong stories within this anthology will most likely find this a bland, and relatively unsexy, experience.

Arrow Video has released Immoral Tales on Blu-Ray with a great HD transfer. Since each of the shorts had a different cinematographer, its interesting to see how each of the stories differs in quality. Therese Philisophe, the second short, is noticeably more grainy than the other three, and The Beast of Gevaudan differs slightly in this regard as well. However, there are no real problems in this transfer aside from the usual small imperfections in film. The audio is presented in Mono 2.0 PCM and also sounds very good, although youll be using the subtitles for most of the dialogue; however, most of Immoral Tales is period-piece music anyway.

The packaging for Immoral Tales comes with reversible sleeve and a pull-out booklet, and comes with a Blu-Ray/DVD of the film. Arrow Video generously includes both the four-short version and the cut with The Beast of Gevaudan too, so you can experience whichever one you think is more effective.

Besides obvious theatrical trailer, theres a new introduction by Borowczyk critic Daniel Bird, which is presented with written statements and clips instead of a standard interview. Also available is a 16-minute interview featurette with some of the crew behind the camera of Immoral Tales, discussing the filming, the real blood bath, and other interesting tidbits in the film. Obscure Pleasures is an hour-long interview with Borowczyk featuring different clips, artwork, and cartoon animations, and Blow-Ups is a 4-minute recap of some of Borowczyks art along with cue card notations.

All told, this is a really great package; its just unfortunate that I wasn't a huge fan of the film itself. While fans of Borowczyks work will certainly need this Blu-Ray, viewers who don't share fascination with the director can and should skip this release.",1447200000,,5891,5.118626430801249
1080755,3,6305807876,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

When it comes to movie made in other countries we here in the U.S. rarely accept or encourage their viewing. Yes I know there is a market for these films but it is a niche market at best for the most part. Thats sad. Rather than shy away from other points of view or have the opportunity to see something that might not be as mainstream as the rest, weve settled on watching things only we create and complain about the fact that we have to read subtitles. For that reason when the chance presents itself I often try to watch foreign films.

All that being said there is a difference in film when you look at these works as well. The steadfast plotlines used in American film are not always adhered to. There are times thats a good thing and others when it is not. In any event what Ive learned from most foreign films is that there are more risks being taken there than in our movies for the most part.

One more thing as viewers we need to take into consideration. Coming from the U.S. we have more freedoms and have had them longer than other countries and when viewing movies we need to keep that in mind. Artistic suppression sometimes decades long stirs something in artists to step out of the box, to come up with something different and sometimes uncomfortable, a display of the feelings and emotions long held in check. If, as we watch, we remember that then foreign films take on a different quality.

Which brings me to IMMORAL TALES. Director Walerian Borowczyk was a Polish born director who first studied art, eventually attracted to the possibilities of film. His animated short predated those of Monty Python alum Terry Gilliam who seems to have adopted his style. Those works led to his interest in pursuing feature films. But to say his films are not like most is an understatement. Borowczyk always seems more interested in what we see, in the visual, than the story being told. Its as if story takes second place to visuals in his films.

IMMORAL TALES features four stories with little in common except for the theme of sex. The first story tells of a young mans obsession and eventual seduction of his cousin, taking her to a beach and comparing his oral gratification by her to the tides. The second story revolves around a teenage girl in what seems to be medieval times infatuated with the church as she mixes her desires with images of the Catholic Church while masturbating in a locked room. The third story involves the legend of Elizabeth Bathory who was said to bathe in the blood of virgins to retain her youth. In this story that appears to be the case as she gathers a group of young women from a local village, strips them down and watches them cavort nude before taking the legendary bath. The final story concerns young Lucrezia Borgia, the daughter of Pope Alexander VI, having sex with her male relatives and their assistants. So from these descriptions it becomes obvious that the main thing that ties them together is sex.

So what would prompt a highly regarded artistic director like Borowczyk to make a movie that at times feels more like soft core porn than art? Looking deeper into the film I learned that at the time the movie was made (1974) short films were not the rage they had been earlier. At the suggestion of his producer and because of the relaxed censorship in France it was thought that by directing a sexual film like this Borowczyk could draw a bigger audience to his films. The response to the film was mixed with some liking it and others feeling that his decision guided him more into the realm of pornographer than artist. While the movie did well at the box office many felt that it was his weakest film and that it led to a decline in his abilities.

So with the storyline described and a touch of history added what did I think of the film? On a story level it left me wondering just what story was being told. The fact that there was no theme running through each left me confused. Then again perhaps thats the American in me having grown up with stories in film that run beginning, middle and end. For me as a viewer then the movie wasn't necessarily an entertaining experience.

But there is also the artistic merit to consider with this movie. Borowczyk does have an eye for film. Images that he places on the screen are often unlike any other and I mean that in a good way. His framing of certain scenes brings to mind more famous works of art than they do pornography. While there is definitely nudity in the film none of it has the hardcore sensibilities that the world of pornography has made easily accessible with the click of a mouse online these days. I don't doubt that it was considered shocking at the time but viewers today will consider it mild for the most part.

From a moral standing it will all depend on your beliefs. Christians will undoubtedly be shocked by the images of religious leaders caught up in sex with various characters here. The incestuous relationship in the first story is sure to upset as well. Non-religious viewers will then rally to defend the film as art. The question of Borowczyks motive in doing so will not be discussed if that argument is followed. Was it done to shock or was it done as a reaction to years of repression he felt? One you get past the eroticism he uses that becomes the question.

Arrow Video does another outstanding job of extras, one of the main reasons that movie fans have begun flocking to their releases. With the exception of Criterion films release you won't find many companies that delve this deep into their offerings. The biggest difference is that Arrow doesnt charge an outrageous fee for this with their movies at a more affordable price. Included on this release are a new high def digital transfer of not only the version Ive described here but the five-part film that included The Beast (a segment that Borowczyk adapted into another feature also available from Arrow), an introduction by Borowczyk expert Daniel Bird, an interview featuring the production manager and cinematographer of the film, an archival interview with Borowczyk, a visual essay about Borowczyks works on paper, a theatrical trailer, an illustrated booklet with writing on the film by Bird and an archive piece by Philip Strick and a reversible sleeve for the cover.

In the end I cant say that I loved this film or would go back and watch it again but I will say it present an interesting look at film making from another country and the sensibilities involved because of that. While some will hail it as great art I felt more like I witnessed the potential of a great film maker gone to waste on something that was dropped into the world as pornography. It would have been interesting to see what he would have done with a more mainstream film.",1443484800,,6824,4.566993464052287
1080756,4,6305807876,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I have to say, 1974 was an excellent year.  The UPC code made its debut; Muhammad Ali regained the Heavyweight title in The Rumble in the Jungle; THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE was released on an unsuspecting public; and, oh yeahI was born.  It also marked director Walerian Borowczyks first foray into explicit eroticism with IMMORAL TALES.  I first heard of this film many, many years ago, but I never thought Id get the chance to see it.  Thanks to the fine folks at Arrow Video and MVD, this classic sexploitation piece is now available in HD.  And while it won't appeal to everyone, fans of this genre will label this as a Must See!

I really wasn't sure what to expect with this film, particularly because Im somewhat familiar with some of his later work.  I reviewed another film of Borowczyks a while back titled THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MISS OSBOURNE, so I figured this one might be another surrealistic jaunt into the bizarre.  Interestingly enough, I was wrong; IMMORAL TALES deals less with the strange and more with the expressive.

IMMORAL TALES is shot very well, and it looks more like an artistic piece than a feature film.  I am impressed with how well Borowczyk utilized camera angles to enhance the sensuality of the film.  For example, the cover art on the Blu-ray is actually a shot taken from the film.  This close-up accentuates the sexiness of the steamy scene and sets the tone for the act that follows.

The acting is so-so, but the viewer is not focused on the expressive talents of the cast in this film.  More can be said of what the actors don't say, as opposed to their actual dialogue.  This is not a negative at all, but more of an observation.  In the end, this does nothing to dampen the entertainment experience as a whole.

When I sat down to view IMMORAL TALES, I watched the extended version, which includes the short film The Beast of Gvaudan, upon which another of Borowczyks notorious films is based, THE BEAST.  This was interesting, as much of the footage from THE BEAST came from this short.  I enjoyed this, as it gave a bit of a behind-the-scenes feel to the piece.

IMMORAL TALES is a win for me, and I recommend it.  Fans of dated exploitation films will love this one, as will folks looking for some vintage erotica.",1443398400,,2347,4.538095238095238

1080758,3,6305807876,"Immoral Tales is a collection of four erotic stories from director Walerian Borowczyk. The movie is a through-the-ages look at eroticism featuring both historical and fictional characters. The 1976 film is notable because of its quantity of total female nudity  not the carefully photographed, expertly lighted love making scenes of Hollywood films, but long takes in brightly lit settings featuring totally nude women or women in flimsy see-through attire.

The film begins with The Tide, a modern story of a young man (Fabrice Luchini) who tricks his naive teenage cousin Julie (Lise Danvers) into pleasuring him by turning her head with poetic allusions to nature, and making himself out to be a knowledgeable man of the world, even though he is just a bit older. He easily bends Julie to his will. Therese the Philosopher is about a religiously devout French girl (Charlotte Alexandra) in 1890 who is wrongfully punished and locked in a room for three days where words she hears from God encourage her to explore her sensuality.

 Erzebet Bathory  tells of a woman who seduces young women under the masquerade of granting them eternal bliss if they touch her pearl-encrusted gown. About twenty naked girls go into a crazed frenzy when they see Bathory (Paloma Picasso) in her dress, but they are destined not for eternal bliss, but something quite horrible. The final story involves Lucrezia Borgia (Florence Bellamy) having a threesome with Pope Alexander VI (her father) and a cardinal (her brother Cesare) while her impotent weakling of a husband in sent away.

Intended to shock, the movie doesnt pack the same wallop today, though the last two stories in particular still captivate. The theme running through the quartet of tales is the prevalence of sex and sensuality throughout history and across all classes. Admittedly, director Borowczyk focuses on the kinky aspects of sex and his unrestrained portrayal of total nudity can be regarded as either artistry or pure exploitation. You will have to decide.
The film bears influences of both Pier Paolo Pasolini and Ken Russell.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include an introduction by Borowczyk expert Daniel Bird, an archival interview with Borowczyk in which the filmmaker discusses cinema and sex, a visual essay, reversible sleeve featuring the directors own original poster design, and an illustrated booklet. The film is in French, with English subtitles.",1442534400,3,2431,5.186224489795919
1080759,5,6305807876,"This review is for the new edition (2015) of Walerian Borowczyk's ""Immoral Tales"" released by Arrow Video from the UK. Please note (per 'comments')  that there are some slight differences in the content of the 'extras' included on the disks between the Euro Region 2 PAL release (per this review) and the N. American NTSC Region 1 release.

""Immoral Tales""(1974) was Borowczyk's first 'concerted' foray into the realm of 'erotic' cinema and it created quite a stir upon its' initial screening at the prestigious British Film Institute (BFI) in London. The film originally consisted of 5 vignettes - the most outrageous of which: ""The Beast of Gevaudan"" was removed prior to general release - subsequently to be expanded and re-worked into the feature length movie ""The Beast"" - which was, arguably, Borowczyk's most controversial production.

Arrow Video has taken it upon themselves to re-release many of Borowczyk's most well known (albeit previously VERY difficult to find) films in a new series of combo BluRay + standard DVD formatted disks.  All of these new releases have been given a first class restoration job from original master sources - producing the best visual quality yet for these very interesting and erotic films.  The DVDs (in both formats!) are also loaded with high quality 'extras' - making this 'the definitive' edition to purchase, if one is so inclined.

Polish born, Borowczyk began his film career as an artist and animator, initially working extensively in that milieu creating many (award winning!) short subjects for the cinemas, until that venue lost its' market.  He then was encouraged to move to France where the political and social climate was much more permissive and he began to experiment with erotic themes in the aftermath of the hugely financially successful Euro-eroflik: ""Emmanuelle"".  Borowczyk brought his artistic sensibilities and love of surrealism to all of his movie-making, and has left a rich legacy of particularly artful erotic films.

The four stories which ultimately made up the contents of  ""Immoral Tales"" were intended to display the continuity of erotic themes throughout the ages.  The first story is set in contemporary times and deals with a youthful male & female (cousins) who have a sensuous tryst by the sea that is tied to the timing of the ocean's tides.  The second tale is based on a legend about a young woman who is granted Sainthood after being raped & murdered.  The story actually focuses on some auto-erotic action that the girl has with a cucumber! just prior to her unfortunate cannon-izing demise.  The third vignette deals with the Medieval exploits of the 'mad' Countess Elizabeth Bathory as she rounds up a group of peasant girls and takes them to her castle to provide the blood for her beauty enhancing baths - Picasso's daughter Paloma portrays the crazed Countess.  The final tale takes satirical aim at the Catholic Church in Renaissance times with a look into the incestuous world of the 'Papal' Borgia family.

Throughout all of this quartet of tales there is much artful nudity displayed (both male and female) and exquisite camera work to be appreciated. While ""Immoral Tales"" was considered almost 'pornographic' by some at the time of its' original release - by our modern standards the film's erotic aspects would likely be considered as 'soft-core' and lyrical.  As previously noted - there is a hefty sampling of extra features that include background biographical interviews and featurettes on Borowczyk, as well as, the complete original version of ""Immoral Tales"" that also included the segment from ""The Beast""! This out-take from ""The Beast"" actually features the most sexually explicit material from the later version of the movie - wherein Italian XXX actress Sirpa Lane is pursued by a werewolf like monster with a huge dripping phallus but ultimately turns the tables and screws the poor creature to death! There are also 2 versions of the short film: ""A Private Collection"" that provides a tour of numerous antiquarian sex-toys.

While many of Borowczyk's movies have been available previously in 'un-rated' versions on VHS and DVD - this current pressing is by far the 'ultimate' edition of his works in terms of visual quality and completeness. French language w/ English subs.  Highly recommended for fans of artful erotica!",1440892800,,4338,5.118980169971671

1080839,2,6305807876,"IMMORAL TALES is one of the bits of art-house erotica that's sure to fall short of pleasing modern audiences. It's ponderous sex-scenes are their own penance for those willing to sit through them, failing to hold much interest outside of exposed flesh and suggested depravities. There is little content here or drama for that matter, just boring sexual-tableaux, drawn out to feature length. The cinematography is occasionally interesting, but never truly captivates the eye beyond lensing exploitative elements of period dress being pulled off of young ladies in period settings.",1301702400,2,580,5.455555555555556

Immoral tales is one of these disturbing films which deals with that sort of unpleasant and accusing items about just a few want to talk and take into account. Ferocious hypocrisy supports the double moral that masks of unpolluted dress through these four demolishing stories.
