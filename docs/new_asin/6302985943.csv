527559,4,6302985943,"Forget Scarlett O'Hara!  The big question in Hollywood is who'll play Violet Jansen in ""Girl of the North"".  Studio press agent Jimmy Sutton (Tyrone Power) stumbles across the slim resum belonging to Trudi Hovland (Sonja Henie), a Minnesota schoolteacher with absolutely no experience in acting.  Despite her protests, Trudi and her wisecracking auntie (Edna May Oliver) are packed off to Hollywood.  You can pretty much guess the rest...

Despite a second-rate Irving Berlin score (""The Song of the Metronome"", ""I'm Sorry for Myself"", ""I Poured My Heart into a Song""), SECOND FIDDLE comes alive mainly thanks to the chemistry of Henie and Power--who indeed were romantically involved for a short while during production of the movie.

SECOND FIDDLE is available (along with the other big Sonja Henie favourite SUN VALLEY SERENADE) on DVD in the United Kingdom.  Currently, the only Henie film available in the domestic United States is her second-to-last one, IT'S A PLEASURE.",1242777600,,977,5.264516129032258
527560,5,6302985943,"Okay, Sonia Henie may not be the best actress ever, but I think she does a plenty adequate job here.  After all, she's playing a midwest school teacher who is caught unawares that she has been entered into a nation-wide talent search for ""The Girl of the North"".  Given this is the role she's playing, the role of a school teacher who is suddenly thrust into the limelight, what kind of acting experience do you need?  I felt her portrayal was realistic!  I mean, one day you're a school teacher, the next day, your acting in movies?  Of course you are going to be awkward, not to mention scared out of your wits.

Ty was just outstanding.  He was funny, charming, and a bit of Cyrnao De Bergerac thrown in (when he's writing love songs for the other guy to sing to the girl who he loves).

*****Spoiler Alert*****

I LOVED the last scene, where Sonia's character has just been married to the wrong man, and at the last minute, we find out the minister's license has expired, and Ty jumps right in between the unhappy 'groom' and the bewildered but happy 'bride'.  Perfect comedic timing!  This was the kind of role I could imagine Jimmy Stewart playing, although I can't imagine Jimmy doing more justice to the role than Ty did.

The only way this movie could be better would be for a dvd release to emerge (no foreign bootlegs, please - Fox Studios, are you listening?).  Oh, and with the original theatrical trailer, please! Thanks!",1171152000,5,1435,4.536964980544747
527561,5,6302985943,"This is fun indeed. Sonja is surrounded by toptalent such as Irving Berlin(but not his best score), Tyrone Power, Rudy Vallee and Edna May Oliver. Unfortunately she is not given much to do outside her numbers, but it is apparent that she was on her way to become warm in front of the cameras as an actress. Edna May Oliver stands out as a warm and cynic aunt Phoebe. Sonja`s solo on ice is terrific; u can see she is in great pain because of her heart-aches and how she`s feeling better and throws off her sorrows through her work-out on ice. That`s an actress on ice. They say that no one has ever controlled an audience on ice the way Sonja Henie did it.
Her tango was initially edited, but Sonja demanded it back as a whole and she was the only star to contradict Darryl F. Zanuck. Her temperament and clashes with Zanuck are part of Hollywood-legend. Milton Berle once declared: ""I wouldn`t say she controlled - but she had the wip!"" hehehe...",1089676800,11,947,4.417142857142857
527562,3,6302985943,"If you're looking for typical Irving Berlin song  hits, skip this one (""The Song of the Metronome"" is one of the deathless ditties here). But if you're in the mood for an agreeable musical show,  there are  engaging vocals by Mary Healy and The King Sisters, and Sonja Henie's  skating is impressive. The plot parodies Hollywood's ""search for  Scarlett O'Hara,"" with schoolteacher Henie brought to the movie  capital by press agent Tyrone Power. Good supporting cast, especially Edna  May Oliver as Henie's maiden aunt. The picture and sound quality are  excellent.",942019200,9,565,5.131868131868132

What a beautiful gal. Anyway it's a classic story of what happens when a fake is invented - complications!  Edna May Oliver as Aunt Phoebe is priceless!  As usual you are treated to Sonja Henie's superb figure ice skating and there's lots of music, so go back to the more golden days of old Hollywood and get a feel for how it was when it was good!",1513814400,,517,4.309278350515464

7833027,5,6302985943,"Ladies in my age group were wild about Tyrone Power.  This was one of his early movies before the studios realized that those good looks made him the perfect actor for the costume dramas (pirate, Zorro, swordsman).  He's paired with Sonia Henie, the woman who did for ice skating what Esther Williams did for swimming.  It's a lighthearted comedy, and very enjoyable.",1378512000,,367,4.887096774193548

7833029,2,6302985943,"The second film starring Sonja Henie that I saw from 1939, `Second Fiddle' had much less of an impact on me than the previously reviewed `Everything Happens at Night' (a delightful little film).  `Second Fiddle' has its moments, but at the end of the night I felt that there was too little keeping this film going to keep me coming back for me.  Tyrone Power is great here, and he proves as the film's driving force.  Without his energetic and dynamic delivery, the film would have been a complete failure.  Sonja Henie is a fantastic ice skater, but the film couldn't mask her lack of range as an actress enough to make me believe her.  Sadly, she is playing a young teacher who is discovered in a casting call for the most coveted lead role in Hollywood, and supposedly she is AMAZING.  I didn't believe that for a second.  Sure, this is a screwball comedy and so maybe I should take her supposed greatness with a grain of salt, but she's not even a good comedic actress.  Basically she stands or sits there with doe eyes and waits for the actors around her to steal the scene.  The musical numbers were stilted, and Vallee's singing left a lot to be desired (sacrilegious, I know).  Many of the scenes were so preposterous they weren't even humorous (the glass throwing scene in particular), but it's a sign of the times maybe.  Eh, when all is said and done this is a film that offers very little.  I predictable story we've seen done far better more recently.  Alas, the Oscar nominated Original Song (`I Poured My Heart Into a Song') is quite nice, and the scene where Tyrone Power's character writes it was possibly my favorite scene in the film (the most honest at least, yet still comedicly laced).",1336348800,2,1707,4.53921568627451
7833030,5,6302985943,"This is the young Tyrone Power at his best.  Lighthearted,funny movie with Sonja Henie in the role of a young ice skater turned movie star, and Ty Power as a slick promoter-talent scout who falls for her. Edna Mae Oliver steals the show as Sonja's protective aunt. Her love-hate relationship with Tyrone makes for some cute scenes. Ty tries his hand at singing and playing the piano as he composes ""I Poured My Heart Into A Song"", which was actually composed by Irving Berlin.",1330732800,,476,4.666666666666667
7833031,4,6302985943,"""Second Fiddle"" is a winter tradition at my home. This is yet another film that proves how well Tyrone Power could act and carry a film.
It's fun, full of romance, and fantastic!
Tyrone never looked better.
Twentieth Century Fox needs to release this film in a box set that includes other Tyrone Power treats such as ""Lloyd's of London"",""Thin Ice"",""Suez"",""Alexander's Ragtime Band"",""Rawhide"" etc, etc.!
This guy deserves ALL his films to be released in DVD format!",1325376000,,464,5.038961038961039
