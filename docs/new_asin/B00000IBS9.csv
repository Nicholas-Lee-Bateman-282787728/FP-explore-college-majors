1219356,5,B00000IBS9,"The descent into delusion and insanity is skillfully portrayed by Isabelle Adjani in this film that opens by stating that it is about ""events that really happened, and people who really existed"".
Set mostly in Halifax, beginning in 1863, the cinematography by Nestor Almendros is exquisite, with the camera lovingly capturing Adjani's gorgeous face. Using a somber palette, with occasional patches of brilliant red, it often has the look of an old painting, and the music of the early 20th century composer Maurice Jaubert fits in nicely.
Francois Truffaut (who 19 minutes into the film makes a brief cameo appearance) tells this story with gentleness and sensitivity, keeping the pace flowing; though a rather gloomy tale, it never gets either depressing or boring. It shows what started out as love, with a resolution to bravely cross the ocean to be with her lover, become increasingly demented, from being a stalker, to debasing herself by her willingness to ""share"", to the end, which takes place in Barbados. In the short and almost mute part of Baa, Madame Louise is a powerful and beautiful presence.
Adjani won numerous awards for this 1975 film, and was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar (Louise Fletcher won for ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""). Though the make-up is subtle and clever, it's her stellar performance that bring believability to this film.
The historical photos and information in the final scene are fascinating, and make for a satisfying ending to another of Truffaut's great films, and one I have enjoyed seeing numerous times.",1042156800,58,1559,5.070038910505836
1219357,4,B00000IBS9,"This is done in a semi-documentary style in that it switches back and forth between a narrative format and dramatic scenes. It deals with the life of the daughter of Victor Hugo and her obsession with a young British officer who lacks even the slightest interest in her. It was quite well done and visually beautiful, but a bit hard to take as she deteriorates from a beautiful, well-off young girl into a street crazy. Don't watch this if you are looking for a happy ending, feel-good sort of film or have a lot of scars from an unrequited love (a friend of mine couldn't finish watching it), but if you have an interest in 19th century culture and society it is worth your time.",996364800,16,680,4.448
1219358,4,B00000IBS9,"Being a fan of Truffaut and having seen such great movies of his as THE BRIDE WORE BLACK, THE 400 BLOWS, and THE WILD CHILD i expected this film to be as great but unfortunatly it was not as great as the ones i have mentioned but it is not one of Truffaut's worst either. It manages to make the cut because of great direction, cinematography, costumes, sets, locations, and most of all because of Isabelle Adjani's great and haunting performance, a performance for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for best actress and an award she should have won but which she lost to Louise Fletcher for ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST. She portrays the daughter of Victor Hugo, Adele Hugo (hence the H in the title). The story is based on true events which were recorded in a diary the real Adele kept. Adele falls in love with a soldier she met in France and soon after he leaves her and goes to Halifax, Nova Scotia. The movie begins by showing us Adele arriving in Nova Scotia and from then on we see her try to win her love back but he reveals he had no serious intentions with her and she becomes obsessed with getting him back. She has little pride and dignity and she does what she has to do to get him back and we see her suffer and through journal entries and letters we understand what she is going through psychologically. But for some reason the movie never becomes totally emotioanlly involving which is the problem. If it had it would have been a masterpiece. I think this might be due to the script in some way. But if not for Adjani this might have been a mediocre movie. You can't take your eyes off her delicate beauty. As Truffaut once said ""you could make a movie about just her face."" Also look for a cameo by Truffaut as a soldier who runs into Adjani on the street.",995241600,9,1788,4.308605341246291
1219359,4,B00000IBS9,"Isabelle Adjani plays the title role, that of Adele Hugo, daughter of the great French writer, a woman obsessively in love with an English army lieutenant who doesn't want her.  The scene is Halifax, Nova Scotia, during the time of the American Civil War.  She has followed Lt. Pinson (Bruce Robinson) from her home in exile on the island of Guernsey to be with him even though he has rejected her.  Adjani's sensuous beauty and her intense and passionate nature command the screen and we are drawn to identify with her as she spirals toward madness as her abject pleas of love are unrequited.  We watch as she debases herself in every way possible in a desperate attempt to gain Pinson's love, even to the point of giving him to other women.  She is psychologically pleased with this because she thinks it shows that her love for him transcends sexuality. Of course the nature of obsessive love is always entirely selfish.  If you really love someone who doesn't want you, you have to let them go.  But of course she cannot.
Francois Truffaut directed and did a fine job of getting the most out of his young star.  The maddening nature of obsession is well depicted and the story is focused and unfolds at a deliberate pace.  Noteworthy is the setting itself, a cold and remote clime so that Adele is in isolation from her home, family and friends with little to do or think about every day except her obsession.  It is easy to see how something like this can lead to complete madness.
Memorable is a little story within the larger tale, that of the fraudulent hypnotist whom Adele thinks might be able to turn Pinson's indifference into love.",991526400,9,1644,4.618556701030927
1219360,4,B00000IBS9,"Isabelle Adjani does a marvelous job of portraying the daughter of Victor Hugo, who is obsessively and unrequitedly in love with a soldier. However, there are some flaws in the film.  At times it is curiously flat, which obsessive love stories rarely are.  It also drags in spots which is unexpected for a Truffaut film.  But a flawed Truffaut film is still a lot better than most other films.  Adjani will strike you as incredibly restrained here if you compare this with her performance as Camille Claudel, where she is absolutely electric.

1219381,5,B00000IBS9,"This film somewhat ""romanticizes"" the real Adele Hugo; she was actually 32 when she followed Pinson to Halifax, had already turned down a marriage proposal from the object of her obsession under the influence of anti-marriage, ""free love"" proto-feminist George Sand, had displayed evidence of mental illness for several years prior to her ""trip,""  and Pinson no longer even pretended to be a suitor for at least six years before Halifax. Nevertheless, Isabelle Adjani gives a memorable Oscar-nominated performance a person completely consumed by her ""religion of love."" Bruce Robinson's Pinson is as intended  heartless in his rejection of Adele's entreaties, although it should be noted that her actions would be classified as ""stalking"" of a rather persistent variety. I also found it interesting that Adele was almost a pathological liar, apparently  in an attempt to conceal her passion from outsiders. However, seeing a young, fresh Adjani devolve into ragged emotional and physical wreck is painful to watch, even if it is difficult to fathom. The Blu-ray, which I purchased from Screen Archives, is far better than the original DVD release, although some of the dark scenes still look a little patchy.

1219404,5,B00000IBS9,"Francois Truffaut is one of my favorite French directors, to date, and has a real knack for storytelling and bringing a great energy to his actors and the stories they recount through their screen personas. The Story of Adele H. is no different from his other pieces (including Four Hundred Blows, Small Change, and Day for Night). Isabel Adjani is luminous in her role of the title character, Adele H., daughter of famed writer Victor Hugo. The young woman follows her lover to Halifax, Canada from her home in France, where she resides with her parents. Her lover (Bruce Robinson) is a hopeless cad and, all in all, quite a jerk. ""Not worth the dirt on the bottom of her shoe"" as my mother would say. In fact, he insists that Adele return back to her home because he has nothing to offer her nor does Halifax. Of course, love is blind and deaf (at times). Adele persists and travels into the realm of delusion in order to secure monies from her father to be wired from Europe to Canada for the duration of her stay. The lies get more elaborate as the story progresses. She claims that she and her lover are engaged and even married in a church wedding. All the while, he is off making it with all of his mistresses and hoping Adele leave.

Chillingly, this story is actually based on real events. Adele really existed and this harrowing tale really happened. As viewer, I feel drawn into her story within moments of the first frames. Isabel Adjani and the cast are absolutely terrific. The cold, wintry mornings in Halifax are beautifully depicted. The cinematography feels almost muddy at times. This only adds to the rustic and real quality of the landscape and the actors' part in it. Great and absolutely haunting.",1383091200,,1720,4.620915032679738
1219405,5,B00000IBS9,"""The Story of Adele H"" is one of Francois Truffaut's best movies, although the brilliance of his direction here will forever take second place to the stunning beauty of Isabel Adjani.  Indeed, it's been said that Truffaut, during the making of the movie, was more an observer of Adjani's great performance than the director of it.

And the entire movie revolves around the beautiful nineteen-yr.-old actress.  This is perhaps the best of Truffaut's cache of movies dealing with outsiders.  Adele Hugo is the epitome of a fallen Romantic--that is, a sympathetic and intelligent figure who seems to be caught in a maelstrom of destruction, at the hands of her own emotions.  The madness that drives her intense obsession with a beautiful but callow French lieutenant is beyond understanding.

Though she has pushed herself to the end of her tether in traveling to Nova Scotia, where she faces only the battering of further rejection, she remains an oddly heroic figure--perhaps sort of a parallel to Tolstoi's Anna Karenina.  She sacrifices everything for love.

Though for most of the movie things continually go from bad to worse, Truffaut does in the end lift the story out of the morass of complete doom and haplessness--for which I felt grateful, I must admit.  Ms. Hugo's dignity was not totally shredded, and the movie is not a total exercise in cruelty.  The manner of her redemption, in Barbados, at the hands of a black woman, carries a touch of irony.

Visually the movie is a complete feast, with painterly cinematography only adding to Adjani's incredible physical beauty.  Truly a ""must-see"".",1374883200,2,1604,5.011320754716981

1219407,5,B00000IBS9,"The 1975 film, Story of Adele H (""H"" as in Hugo - Victor Hugo was her father) is a powerful love story with an unhappy ending.  The power of an obsessive love is often greater than what most of us ever experience - on its own, the obsession drives us to behavior we might never consider if we were in a ""normal state of  mind.""  The ""heroine"" (if you can call her that), Isabelle Adjani, is lovely to observe as her obsessive love pulls her deeper into an emotional quagmire.

1219408,4,B00000IBS9,"I just watched the film last night after spotting it at my local library.  I am an avid Truffaut fan, but have not had the opportunity to watch this film.

I must say that it does not come off as a truly 'Truffaut' film.  The acting is good, actually very good at certain points.  It just plays like a very good period piece, which it is.

The film actually centers around the true story of Adele Hugo, daughter of Victor Hugo.  She flees her family's estate on Guernsey for Halifax, Nova Scotia, following her former lover.  She is obsessed with the man and her obsession becomes (or is a result from) a form of her inherent madness.  The film takes us over several years of her life.

It is interesting that the film is so touching.  We see that the young man had previously duped Adele with promises of marriage in order to 'lie with her'.  This traumatized young Adele and she wanted nothing in the world but for the young man to marry her.  She begins furiously writing a journal (which is how we now know that what happened was truth).  Though she originally disguises her identity, it soon becomes apparent to the people around her who she really is.

Overall the story is history, but also shows a woman's slow descent into madness.  What starts as an obsession quickly deepens into a severe emotional collapse.  Adele is so likable at times, yet we see this progression and feel sorry for her instead of feeling cynical.

The film is rather good, though I probably won't pick it up to watch a second time.",1320624000,2,1514,4.467153284671533

1219411,3,B00000IBS9,"This 1975 film by French director Francois Truffaut had been praised as great, profoundly beautiful and as 'one of the most romantic films of recent years' (Saturday Revue).
 This film is a rich period piece with beautiful settings and average acting, but it is neither romantic, nor profoundly beautiful. It is the tragic story of the rapid decline into madness of a seriosly disturbed very pretty young woman, who happens to be a daughter of Victor Hugo, Adele .
 There is nothing romantic about the obsession of a psychotic person who sinks deeper and deeper into her hell and the cruel rejection of her former suitor, a british hussar of questionable character. Adele has followed him from Guernsey, where the Victor Hugo family was in exile, to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and continues to display increasingly irrational behaviour. She is also vicious and scheming when she doesn't get her way.
 She eventually ends up on Barbados/ West Indies in the streets where a native woman takes pity on her, and takes her back to France where Hugo has reappeared in the meantime, because the political situation in France had changed.
  He has her institutionalized for the next 40 years. Adele eventually died at a ripe old age of 85 in Paris in 1915, which the movie doesn't show. We see her last in the West Indies roaming the streets in her red torn gown. This is not romantic.
 One does indeed wonder why none of her family came to her rescue, but 'pere' Victor must have been too busy with in his many extra marital affairs and only sent 'du fric' (money) , and 'maman' was probably busy with the same, before she took ill and left this mortal coil. Adele's astounding ecapades and general behaviour fit better into the late 20th or early 21st century, rather than into the late 1800's, but they show again that there is nothing new under the sun, least of all,  psychosis and questionable morality.",1270166400,6,1896,4.7272727272727275

1219413,3,B00000IBS9,"This film tells the true tale of one of Victor Hugo's daughters who, obsessed in her love for a man who could seemingly care less about her, follows him to Canada and then to the Caribbean.  She is a desperately unhappy and neurotic woman. If she were alive today she'd be on all sorts of mood altering drugs and receiving all sorts of therapy.

Her story is painful to watch as a result--it's not easy to watch someone spiral into madness. As a film, it's also somewhat difficult to watch because not much progress gets made. She starts out disturbed, she ends up disturbed, and she's disturbed all throughout the middle. The same point keeps getting made over and over again.

Of interest to those who love literature and like to know about great authors and their families, and to those who like period pieces and like to watch how different (and more difficult in many ways) life was back then. The acting is excellent overall, but the story pretty much is a one-note affair and, no matter how well that one note is hit, it can get wearisome to hear it over and over, esp. when it's so bleak.",1185408000,10,1096,4.47

1219417,5,B00000IBS9,"Based on the true story about the obsessive love of Adele Hugo (daughter of Victor Hugo and played beautifully by Isabelle Adjani) for a French soldier (Albert Pinson, played by Bruce Robinson). Adele and Pinson were once lovers and even contemplated marriage, but her family would not consent at first so Pinson leaves - and eventually falls out of love. He joins the army and goes to Halifax, but Adele follows him.

She tries everything to get him to love her again - in vain. She keeps a journal in which she fabricates a life for herself filled with success, where in reality there's only been failure. She slowly slips into madness. When Pinson is shipped to Barbados she even follows him there, living a beggars life in rags; she's totally insane now: she sees Pinson on the street one day and doesn't even recognize him anymore.

Truffaut's brilliance here is not just in the way he develops and explores the passions that motivate and come to obsess Adele, which is moving and intelligent, but also in the way he's able to never allow our sympathies to desert her even though her obsession becomes totally irrational. Adjani is radiant at times as her face reveals the pain of her broken heart. Another gem from Truffaut.",1136937600,10,1230,4.716279069767442
1219418,5,B00000IBS9,"Thirty years later it is hard to imagine ""The Story of Adele H"" without the then twenty-year old Isabelle Adjani as the title character.  But at the time Truffaut's decision to cast the young French theatre star was very risky.  Not because there was any doubt about Adjani's acting, but because casting someone who was arguably the most beautiful actress in the world as a character driven mad by unrequited love raised a potential credibility issue.  Would viewers believe that the advances of a woman so beautiful, passionate, and intelligent were rejected?  And could someone like that elicit sympathy from the average viewer.

But Truffaut knew what he was doing because Adjani's Adele Hugo is 100% convincing.  And rather than going for  audience sympathy they go for audience frustration as the viewer is increasingly exasperated over Adele's self-destructive behavior.  Adjani's breathtaking beauty actually is an asset as Truffaut wants you convinced that the world offers unlimited possibilities for Adele if only she can let go of her obsession.  Adjani plays the character with such intensity that you are finally relieved when Adele's madness has reached the stage where she is no longer aware of her own suffering.

Apparently Adele had other issues before going on her obsessive quest for love.  Her sister drowned a few years before and her parents had always strongly favored her sister.  Adele has recurrent nightmares about drowning.  Marriage and her pursuit of Pinson are her only way to escape from her famous father. Truffaut's stays with blacks, browns, and blues; with much of each frame filled with shadows; not exactly dreary but consistent with a character who has found little non-fantasy happiness during her life.

The camera loves Adjani, a good thing as she is on screen for over 90% of the film.  She was the youngest nominee ever for best actress.  It was the best performance of the 1970's, probably no one but Adjani could have conveyed such inner emotional violence.  It is that extremely rare visual performance that does not need subtitles or even sound.

As Roger Ebert noted:  ""Truffaut finds a certain nobility in Adele. He quotes one of the passages in her diaries twice: She writes that she will walk across the ocean to be with her lover. He sees this, not as a declaration of love, but as a statement of a single-mindedness so total that a kind of grandeur creeps into it. Adele was mad, yes, probably - but she lived her life on such a vast and romantic scale that it's just as well Pinson never married her. He would have become a disappointment"".

7909675,4,B00000IBS9,"You are supposed to love this film, and that is because of the haunting performance of Isabelle Adjani, who as Adele Hugo, is utterly smitten with a soldier, following him to what is now Canada.

She rents a dismal place, and writes him letters, and I love how the seller needed to give her a discount on parchment, because she wrote so many letters.

There is no embarrassment.  She is utterly besotted.  She follows him everywhere.  Pretending she has a baby.  Ultimately going crazy.

This is the gorgeous enigmatic Isabelle Adjani's film.  She is very young, but she invests fully, so she is just a mad prisoner.

I love the starkness of the film.",1446854400,,651,4.640350877192983
7909676,5,B00000IBS9,"Said to be a portrayal of a historical figure (Adele Hugo, second daughter of Victor Hugo) under a romantic obsession who ultimately goes crazy,  this movie evokes unsettling parallels with the plight of women in every age, including our own, who are indeed subject to the irrational sexual whims of the men they love and seek a committed relationship with.  Truffault shows woman's capacities to love in poignant relief, letting us see her at her best and worst.  The film illustrate's one philosopher's view that ""love is not peace.""",1446249600,2,535,4.98876404494382
7909677,5,B00000IBS9,"A haunting performance from a young Isabelle Adjani which quite simply takes the breath away. Aware of this film for many years, I only, finally, got to see it a few days ago. With direction by the genius hand of Francois Truffaut, this is a sublime film that focuses the attention of the viewer onto the eyes of Adjani, in  the title role of Adele Hugo, virtually throughout the entire film. Totally mesmerising, it is a film  I shall watch several times again purely for the nuances Isabelle Adjani incorporates into a sublime acting performance that is the heart of this towering work of French cinema.",1439164800,,605,4.69811320754717
7909678,5,B00000IBS9,"Heartbreaking story, beautifully rendered in film. Arguably, Adjani's best performance, ever. She channels her character's psychology with such astonishing fluidity, you can't help but think about the nature of good acting..art? Talent? Possession? Perhaps an arcane combo of all three.",1435708800,,286,6.175
