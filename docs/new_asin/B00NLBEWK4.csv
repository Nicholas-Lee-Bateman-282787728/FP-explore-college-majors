8678805,1,B00NLBEWK4,"I thought I'd add a review since there's only one.  HISTORY MAKES THE WORST DOCUMENTARIES ON EARTH!!!  They are far from intellectually stimulating, they use silly jump cuts, gratuitous graphics, silly dramatizations (#1 sign of poor film making), ridiculous sound effects and stupid Transformers like music scores.  THEY ARE AWFUL!!! NO HISTORIAN is employed by History as a producer and it shows!!!  They're all cheap, corny, TV jockeys.  Now they're ruining the Brits documentaries as well - the best in the world at constructing them.  PLEASE STOP HISTORY - They only people that watch your garbage are 13 year old mouth breathing fools who don't care and hate them by the time they mature and see how terrible they are.  These two docs are shallow, silly, filled with terrible voice overs and dramatizations - AWFUL.  FIRE THE PERSON MAKING ALL THIS TRASH.  History has NEVER produced a good documentary - they're famous for it.",1475107200,2,933,5.0064935064935066
