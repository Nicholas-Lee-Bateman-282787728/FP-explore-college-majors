8015653,2,B0001OKTN8,"scary movies 1 and 2 were of a humourous quality, but from my point of view the third was a big let down as the content was not as good as the critics said it was going to be and this let down the scary movie trilogy. sorry but i think that the humour could of had one more look over with the comedy eyes!!!",1092182400,,307,3.7384615384615385
8015654,1,B0001OKTN8,This entry is a waste of time. I enjoy a stupid movie as much as the next guy - but this is lame beyond compare! Right from the begining you are made aware of just how lame this flick is. The first jokes falls flat  (despite all the silicone)as do 99.99999% of the jokes in this suburban middle age white man humour fest.,1084406400,,321,4.095238095238095
8015655,5,B0001OKTN8,"As a film critic for the herald, I would definately say this was by far the best one out of the trilogy. Once again the cast was able to make me nearly choke on my popcorn in the theatre. If your looking for a comedy, this is the one to see! I garantee!",1078876800,,253,3.792452830188679
