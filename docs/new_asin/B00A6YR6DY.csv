5391075,1,B00A6YR6DY,It was terrible they give you an idea thatis A monster croc destroying citys instead all it is A long croc killing people.,1369958400,,122,4.3478260869565215

5391077,2,B00A6YR6DY,Though it is well made and has some good effects it is by no means the Monster Movie the cover advertises and doesn't really jell as either a comedy or family drama. Not recommended.,1368057600,,182,4.382352941176471

5391080,4,B00A6YR6DY,"What an oddly sweet and funny ""monster"" movie.  The title, of course, is very misleading.  (The original title wasn't much of an improvement, though more to the point.)
Yes, this particular crocodile is bigger than normal and she did dash through a building, but she isn't Godzilla-big nor does she possess any special powers.
The story involves several converging scenarios.  There's a man who buys some crocodiles allowing the owner to believe they're going to a zoo (he actually plans on serving them to customers).  The BIG croc in question is loath to become anyone's meal and escapes.  An irate young woman (I found her funny, some might not), comes across the escaped croc and loses her handbag (containing her life savings in cash) down the gaping maw.  She tries enlisting the help of the police (here her tactics prove to be quite persuasive through sheer persistence alone), and ends up with a guy who's notorious for not being able to shoot straight.  Paths criss-cross, hunters get involved once the stomach contents are well known; it's oddly endearing how these strange people end up impacting each other's lives.  I liked this movie.  But it is less about the crocodile and more about the various people in hot pursuit.  Yes, things get a little bloody from time to time and yes, there is a skinny dipping scene with a group of little boys in the same lake that the crocodile heads for.  It makes for a tense moment.

It's a keeper.",1364169600,12,1448,4.748
5391081,4,B00A6YR6DY,"Don't let the idiotic title fool you. It's NOT a made-for-Sy Fy-channel original. It's an extremely well made, very funny Chinese creature feature that was called ""Million Dollar Crocodile"" in China, but whose title was daftly changed to ""Croczilla"" in order to appeal to the dumbing down of American filmgoers (the same people who love dreck like Michael Bay and the ""American Pie"" films).

This film was a bit too long, but it had likeable characters (the main woman was annoying, yes, but I liked her spunk, and she was funny) and really good CGI (much better than in a lot of American films). There was a sense of fun permeating this film that's missing from a lot of recent creature features. The humor in it was just so odd! Definitely one of the better giant animal films to come along. Highly recommended, especially if you're in the mood for something different.",1362528000,10,871,4.730263157894737
5391082,2,B00A6YR6DY,"I LOVE B-rated Croc movies no matter how cheesy, I did like the look of this croc it was better than alot Ive seen, however, I rented it on title alone so didn't know it was a chinese movie, not that it mattered, cause I love Japanese movies, couldn't be too different. WRONG,I didn't like the acting,at all, the woman was very annoying and in my opinion nearly killed the movie. Also I was TOTALLY SHOCKED and APPALLED that it showed a naked boys privates at the age of 9 maybe 11 WOW, REALLY!!! DISGUSTED!!",1360800000,4,508,4.3578947368421055

5391085,3,B00A6YR6DY,"Do you like foreign films?  Do you like B flicks?  Then you'll enjoy this movie.  Would I recommend it to friends...nope, but if you're bored, drunk and seen everything else...it's good for a few laughs",1478390400,,202,4.714285714285714
5391086,2,B00A6YR6DY,"Typical B movie with unnecessary child nudity. The movie takes place in Japan so there are many differences from the American b movies we see on SYFY, with enough similarities to make it a decent B movie,  but make no mistake this was a SYFY B movie. If not for the child nudity I would have given it 4 stars. I found that to be reprehensible and totally unnecessary to the movie. The same effect could have been accomplished by having the boys swim in their shorts or swimsuits. I would NOT recommend this film.

5391101,4,B00A6YR6DY,"it isn't a scary monster movie. it's a sad story about a man who can no longer care for his crocodiles and sells them to what he believes is a zoo. the truth is the man who brought the crocs is the owner of a restaurant  specializing in crocodile meat. the oldest and largest croc escapes and slowly tries to make his way home. it crosses paths with a woman who just returned from working abroad and has her life savings $100,000 euros(1 million chinese dollars) in her purse. the croc eats her purse and she spends the rest of the movie trying to get the police to help her get her money back. the main cop's son is friends with the croc and tries to keep the croc alive. If you're not use to chinese movies and the way they over exaggerate in their acting you probably won't like this. This movie is more story driven, so the plot focuses more on the interactions between characters rather than action sequences. The movie is dubbed in english and the sync is off at times, but not enough to impede viewing.",1471478400,4,1009,4.310526315789474

5391151,4,B00A6YR6DY,"As mentioned in other reviews, the title and cover of this DVD are VERY misleading. Don't expect this to be a Japanese kaiju movie or gory creature feature with a giant croc eating everyone it meets. The original title was Million Dollar Crocodile--a more apt title as the crocodile swallows a purse containing 100,000 euros, which is equivalent to 1 million in Chinese money. It's an enjoyable sort of action/comedy/family flick with a good story, interesting characters, and a nicely rendered CGI crocodile. It provides some thrills and some laughs and, despite the subject matter, maintains a lighthearted tone throughout. That being said, it probably isn't for everyone as it is Chinese dubbed into English (and not dubbed well), does have a little bit of blood, and has full-frontal nude scenes of 10-year-old boys who go skinny dipping (the nudity is not salacious in any way).
