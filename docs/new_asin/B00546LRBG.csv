8456383,5,B00546LRBG,"I consider myself very fortunate to have caught this outstanding documentary by Brooklyn-based Argentinian filmmaker Nicolas Entel on HBO last week.  It was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival.  You can double your appreciation by pairing Entel's work with Jeff and Michael Zimbalist's jawdropping&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ESPN-Films-30-for-30-The-Two-Escobars/dp/B003BEE292/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ESPN Films 30 for 30: The Two Escobars</a>.  What can I say about that film? It is - in my estimation - the best documentary ever produced.  [My previous list-topper had been Leon Gast's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-We-Were-Kings/dp/B00007ELEK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When We Were Kings</a>.]

Entel's coup is to get the full participation of one Juan Sebastian Marroqun Santos.  The name may not ring a bell, but his birth name - Juan Pablo Escobar - surely will.  Once at his father's side during all his raging and running, a mature, introspective Marroqun has the intelligence and insight to comprehend that ""if I want to live, I have to do the opposite of him.""

Those aren't just mere words: Marroqun backs up those sentiments by reaching out to the sons of two famous victims of his father's reign of terror:  Luis Carlos Galn, the Liberal Party presidential candidate, assassinated in August 1989; and Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, Colombian Minister of Justice, assassinated in April 1984.  The meeting between the five offspring (Galan's sons Juan Manuel, Claudio Mario and Carlos Fernando; plus Rodrigo Lara) is a sight to behold - an apology from a son weighed down by the sins of his fathers gratefully (and gracefully) accepted by four impressive adults who hold no malice towards Marroqun.  The rapprochement scene is filmmaking at its finest - That Entel could be inside those walls to record this encounter, no piece of fiction could top something that riveting.",1287532800,5,2011,5.9
