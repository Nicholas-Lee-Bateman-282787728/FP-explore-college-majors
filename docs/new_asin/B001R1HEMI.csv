3772489,4,B001R1HEMI,"I'm a huge fan of 80s cartoons, and I've been waiting a long time to see the Real Ghostbusters get some decent releases on DVD.  In the past it's been available overseas and on odd single disc releases that didn't do the series any justice.  I was a pretty big fan of this show when it originally aired from 1986-91, being constantly amazed by the amazing monster, ghost, and creature designs.  The animation and voice talent always seemed pretty top notch as well.  The complete series is finally available and I have to say that I'm thrilled, though a bit disappointed.

I've been expecting a lot from this set as it was touted as having some lavish production values what with the firehouse packaging, the five steel-book cases, and over 12 hours of bonus features.  The series is spread out over 24 discs (with an included 25th disc with additional bonus features like the series pitch video.)  So what's the verdict?

Well, I'll start with the packaging.  I have to admit that the firehouse packaging, with a couple of Lenticular inserts, is rather fetching.  It's made from sturdy cardboard and fits in pretty well with other DVD's on the shelf (not something you can usually do with this sort of box.)  My one gripe with this outer packaging is that it's designed to open sort of like a stick of deodorant, cut in the middle horizontally with the top half lifting up to expose the five steel-book volumes sitting inside the bottom half.  My problem with this is that because of the weight of the set and because it opens like this you have to grab the set from the bottom only.  I forgot once while I was holding it and the bottom slipped out with all the cases and cashed to the floor ripping the bottom portion of the outer packaging.  As for the steel-books on the individual volumes, they're pretty darn breath taking.  The artwork is great and the DVDs fit nice and sturdy inside.  The 25th disc unfortunately doesn't fit in any of these cases, it's instead housed in a separate cardstock sleeve.

As for the DVDs themselves it's kind of a mixed bag.  On the one hand, it's awesome to finally have access to the entire series, and the quality of the writing and the design of the show holds up pretty darn well.  The series takes a bit of a dip toward the third volume, around the time that Lorenzo Music, Laura Summer, and Arsenio Hall left the series (as well as J.M. Straczynski), but there are still series highlights throughout the run.  The actual video quality leaves a bit to be desired though.  Most episodes are probably about a 4 out of 5 in terms of quality but there are enough 3's that it makes me wonder if Time Life/Sony was spending more time on the flashy packaging than making the show look nice again.

As far as the special features go, this is also a mixed bag.  The stuff produced by Andy Mangels is great, like the making of and interview documentaries, as is some of the archive footage (like the original pitch/pilot episode), but the episode introductions are a waste of time and space on the DVDs (containing very little trivia, mostly just a bunch of smiling faces stating the episode number or title.)  Similarly useless is the ability to play about a third of the episodes without dialogue.  I never understood this as being useful or entertaining.",1255651200,10,3291,4.575085324232082
3772490,4,B001R1HEMI,"I am thrilled that I now own all of the Real Ghostbusters episodes! This DVD set includes 5 steelbook DVD cases that contain all 147 episodes of the series, included the infamous Slimer cartoons. The steelbooks come in a firehouse box resembling the one from the movie and cartoon, the top comes off and the steelbooks sit neatly inside along with a bonus disc and a book giving details about each episode. The firehouse box will fit neatly on a standard size DVD shelf as it's only a little bit taller than a standard DVD case.

My only problem with this set and the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is Time Life's claim of each episode being ""digitally restored"". This simply is not true. Most of the episodes have significant grain and some episodes have severe color saturation. I know this cartoon is nearly 25 years old, but I wish Time Life would stop making these claims about their products when they look the same as they did when they aired.",1255305600,9,957,4.468571428571429
3772491,5,B001R1HEMI,"This was my favorite series growing up and I couldn't wait to get my hands on this set. I paid a little more for it rather then wait for Amazon to sell the product. The first three seasons are great but the fourth season it tends to lean to Slimer more but there are still some good episodes. This dvd set comes in tin cases that look pretty good. However, each picture on the dvd has the same picture for every season. The only real problem I had with the set is I noticed a line of color going down the screen for a few shows but not a major problem. The picture quailty is grainy but watchable, it doesnt look like they took too much time to remaster the set. There is plenty of extra features that are mostly interviews with creators of the show and voice actors of the show, now I found too interesting.

Overall, this is an excellent set for Ghostbuster fans or fans of cartoons like Scooby Doo. The tin cases are cool and comes in The Ghostbuster house with a nice book detailing each episode.",1253491200,15,1000,4.2356020942408374
3772492,5,B001R1HEMI,"Ahh, this stuff brings back memories. I can't remember much of the TV shows I watched as a kid, but a few of these episodes I could actually remember as I viewed them again. The amount of bonus material is staggering, so then they say this is the complete collection, they aren't telling any lies. As this box set contains the ENTIRE series, you'll need to be prepared to pay the $200 selling price, but anyone whos collected TV series on DVD should be used to the price and be willing to make the sacrifice. I did and couldn't be happier.",1251849600,7,539,4.346534653465347
3772493,5,B001R1HEMI,"For anyone who was a fan of the series growing up this is the perfect set for a stroll down memory lane. Have kids? Why not introduce them to a truly awesome cartoon instead of the junk that's passing for children shows now a days. Are you constantly reminded that you are an adult by your significant other and are asked why you still watch cartoons? Why not add to their frustration towards you and add this to your collection.

  The set is a bit pricey, but considering all it comes with ( check Time Life website for full contents) it is by far the best value per dollar complete box set I've seen in a while. Considering this set hasn't been available for less than 179.99 through Time Life, its practically a steal at 125.99. If your on the fence about it ( like I was) make the decision now before the price rises again. This is a must for any ""TRUE"" Ghostbusters fan.",1249603200,4,876,4.296969696969697
3772494,5,B001R1HEMI,"I was a huge Ghostbusters fan growing up in the 80s, and still am to this day.  This cartoon left such an indelible impression on me that throughout the past 20 years different quotes or musical cues from the series often sprang into my head for no reason at all.

I purchased the individual discs that Sony put out a few a few years back but was just left pining for more.  I was ecstatic when I heard the entire series was being released.  I purchased the entire box set from Time Life a couple months back.  I considered waiting until volume 1 was released on it's own but once I saw the firehouse packaging and the bonus disc that was included, I had to get it.  Besides, I'm not very patient.

The extras are plentiful and the menus are nicely done.  Some episodes have introductions, some have isolated score and sound effects tracks, and some have commentary.

Each volume comes in a beautifully decorated solid steel book case and contains five discs per volume, aside from volume 5 which has only four discs.

The episodes all look and sound great and are each shown in their entirety, including the talking logo that was used when going to and coming back from commercial breaks.  In fact, if I were to have one complaint about the set, it's that the talking logo grows a bit tiresome.  With six or seven episodes per disc, and the talking logo showing up about five or six times per episode, you're looking at having to see it around thirty to forty times if you select the `play all' option.  I think it should have been featured as a bonus gallery.  However, that complaint is so minor that it doesn't take anything away from this release.

This set truly sets a standard that other `complete series' sets should strive to achieve.  With the release of the entire animated series and the upcoming releases of both the original film on Blu-ray and the video game in June, this is shaping up to be a very big year for us Ghostbusters fans.",1239235200,94,1950,4.466101694915254
3772495,5,B001R1HEMI,This is a great set for fans but beware.  The sellers on Amazon that charge $200 and more are ripping you off.  You can order the set direct from Time Life for $195 including shipping AND they will let you pay in installments.  Go there first.,1238889600,16,243,4.239130434782608

They were a little more expensive than I wanted to pay, but I got a gift card from family and I could not think of anything else to buy. If you have extra money, loved the show, and are thinking about buying this then please do so and enjoy them as much as I do. The extras are also amazing, I found myself watching the extras and learned more tid-bits about the ""Ghostbuster lore"" and I was really pleased.",1456876800,2,473,4.096774193548387
3772514,5,B001R1HEMI,"This is an excellent box set of the original Real Ghostbusters series.  From the quality of the transfers, you can tell that it was from a tape of some kind (probably studio copy) that was aged.  While it's not as ""crisp"" as it could be, in a way, that adds to the memory of watching it on an old CRTV somehow.  It's fantastic that it has been preserved now, since if the degrading continued, entire episodes could have been lost, and the quality on the DVD's is really not that bad.  With an unbelievable number of episodes in the set, it's well worth the asking price if you're a fan.",1456790400,,586,4.3

3772534,5,B001R1HEMI,As an 80s kid who grew up with the Saturday Morning Cartoon Era this was one of my favorite shows.

3772538,5,B001R1HEMI,"This was one of my favorite animated shows as a child, and I am happy to have it in my collection. I felt the special features were a decent offering. My only complaint about the set is the order the episodes are featured. They are not in the order they originally aired, however it is explained that they are shown in production order instead. I would highly recommend this to any Ghostbusters fan or a child of the late 1980's an early 1990's This show remains an example of just because you are out to sell toys, you don't have to produce a sub-par tied in show.",1442361600,,565,4.289719626168225

3772542,5,B001R1HEMI,Love it.,1434844800,,8,3.5
3772543,5,B001R1HEMI,"I loved this series as a kid. My mom always recorded it while I was at school so it was waiting for me when I got home, then it became impossible to find for years like so many cartoons from the '80s. Sure you could find bootlegs here and there, but for the most part this series lived on as a series of vague flashes of memory from my younger years for 20 years.

Then this wonderful boxed set came out and thank goodness. The case is sturdy cardboard and an interesting conversation piece on a shelf. The metal casing for the DVDs is sturdy, though the way they have the DVDs stacked on top of one another can get annoying. The quality of the episodes are top notch and they look decent even on an HD television. I was also pleasantly surprised to see that a good chunk of the episodes still hold up years later which definitely isn't the case for a lot of animation from this time period. If you read some of my other reviews you'll see I'm not one for looking back on the follies of our youth through nostalgia-tinted glasses so when I say they still hold up I mean it.

If you're a Ghostbusters fan then you should snap this up while it's still available. Just having all of the episodes available in one convenient spot in high quality is worth the price. Add in behind the scenes interviews with show creators and you've got a quality set that's worth the asking price for any true fan.",1433289600,,1393,4.2727272727272725

Whether's it's Slimer's unstoppable binge eating, Venkman's humerus remarks, or the fellas blasting spooky ghosts, this series will capture your imagination and take you back to those days. I've only gotten through 2 discs in the 1'st Season, so plenty more to watch, and I will try to restrain myself from watching these back to back, as 1 episode a day will keep the wife away, lol.

3772624,5,B001R1HEMI,"The Real Ghostbusters was to many kids and adults the pinnacle of 1980's television cartoons. With usually impressive animation and the winning combination of horror, comedy and action-adventure that the made original movie a classic, ""The Real Ghostbusters"" flew in the face of standard Saturday morning shows.

Although the quality dropped with the third network season re-branding to: ""Slimer and the Real Ghostbusters,"" the set doesn't leave anything out, for better or worse, even including Slimer's solo animated shorts which originally played between normal episodes during the show's final seasons.

Still, thanks to its lengthy syndicated run which operated free of network control, the majority of the set contains quality entertainment that still entertains today.

The episodes aren't all you get, with several episode commentaries from writers, directors and artists and several making-of features and extended interviews. For the true die-hard fan all of the background trivia is a real treat. A full-color episode guide book is included to help manage the 134 episodes and 13 Slimer shorts and contains additional bits of trivia.

At its worst, The Real Ghostbusters is a decent cartoon with too much focus on Slimer to the point of making the character extremely annoying. However, when the show is at its best it's the best written and produced cartoon of its time with mature writing that doesn't talk down to its younger viewers.

There is nothing more I could ask for short of a complete remastering which is unlikely to happen with a cartoon of this age and length. If you are a fan of The Real Ghostbusters, this is the total package.",1402272000,5,1656,5.164179104477612

3772645,4,B001R1HEMI,"The Real Ghostbusters is an American animated television series spun-off from the Ghostbusters franchise. The series ran from 1986 to 1991 and continues the adventures of paranormal investigators Dr. Peter Venkman, Dr. Egon Spengler, Dr. Ray Stantz, Winston Zeddemore, their secretary Janine Melnitz and their mascot ghost Slimer.

I won't talk about the technical aspects of this DVD set (episode order, restoration etc.) as that's been covered. The quality of the show however is worth stating. The first season was fun and had a couple misses but mostly hits, introducing villain mainstays like The Boogieman and Samhain. The 2nd (and longest at 65 episodes) season was when the show hit its stride, moving from a network show to syndication. As a result, the writing got stronger and more mature horror themes were explored. By the time the 3rd season came around, STANDARDS AND PRACTICES decided to make the show ""more kid friendly"" and changed the show to suit little kids by moving the mascot, Slimer, to the forefront. Some character designs were changed, voice actors were replaced and the show became silly. By the middle of season 7, the last season, ratings were falling, so they called J. Michael Straczynski, the series original script supervisor and head writer (from seasons 1 to 2) to come back. As a result the last half of season 7 was really on par with seasons 1 and 2.

When I was four and five years old in the late 1980's, I worshiped this show and owned a lot of the toys that accompanied it. As a Ghostbusters fan this stands out as a highlight in the franchise, and next to the 2 80's movies, is probably what most people know about. This series was one of the highlights of Saturday morning animation in the 1980's and was largely responsible for Ghostbusters fever. All in all, this is a great series for fans of Ghostbusters!",1390435200,4,1855,4.79375

3772689,5,B001R1HEMI,"Unlike most DVD collections for old shows, the quality of this one is excellent. It's plainly obvious that this was designed with the fans in mind by people who understand and cherish the franchise.

The overall case is made of extra thick cardboard with a matte feel to it. The case is designed to look like the firehouse and they even took the care to make all the little windows glossy so they reflect a small bit of light. The case also includes two good quality holographics of Slimer and the ghostbuster logo.

Inside there is a thick booklet that divides all of the episodes by season with production numbers, air dates, episode descriptions, and trivia about the episode.

The actual discs are fantastic too! Each season comes in a standard DVD disc case which is clear. The reverse side of the cover art (seen through the clear case from the inside) has copies of the blueprints for the designs of various props from the movies, such as the PKE meter. The menus for each disc are well designed and animated. Most of the special features I have seen include a short message from a voice actor or director who gives a little nuance or trivia about the episode. And if you remember watching these on television, the commercial breaks with the trademark ghost sleeping or trying to escape from the logo are still in place. The only thing its missing are the actual commercials for Micro Machines or those $1.99 a minute hotlines to hear kid's stories from the white dragon. :)

Bottom line. I've purchased other complete DVD sets for old shows and it was obvious they were burned in a sweatshop on an old personal computer. Various episodes would inexplicably skip or the menus were barely serviceable. This is NOT the case with this collection. The quality is outstanding!",1359158400,3,1778,4.689102564102564

3772702,5,B001R1HEMI,"LOVED this series as a kid and have waited a long time for it. Got this set when I first saw it, and was lucky enough to get it from Amazon at 50% off. Worth it? Oh, yeah!

Now, when I say I loved this, what I loved was The Real Ghostbusters, not Slimer and the Real Ghostbusters, and certainly NOT Slimer. I remember the show changing, but had no idea at the time what was going on or why. This boxed set collects everything (or at least, everything that I remember) and PLENTY that I don't. The cool thing is that I can see the transition of the show as it went from prime time to kiddy time. The commentary by the actors, writers, and staff really help to illuminate a bit what those folks felt was going on. And just watching the episodes is tale enough.

One of the reasons that I loved TRG so much was that it wasn't a kid show, at least, not at first. The jokes were deadpan, dry, and what kiddy humor was there was exercised more in the situations or in the ghosts (yup, Slimer was the ectoplasmic bugger joke). The series, of course, changed, but with all the episodes you can really SEE it. That's just cool.

There were plenty of mysteries in the show for me as a kid. I remember when Janine changed, not just her voice but her look. WHAT happened? Well, you get the actual skinny from the folks, but IN the series you actually get an episode that not only recognizes the change but makes it WORK! How cool is that? Even with the whole series in my hands (and now completely watched over the past few weeks), there are still a few mysteries to go with all the nostalgia (Sandman! Samhein! Boogeyman!), pleasant surprises (The return of ghosts! Continuity between episodes! Great references to the movie!), and great discoveries(authentic Japanese language when the Ghostbusters go to Japan!)--like, did anyone else notice the Japanese on the technical drawings?

For people that enjoyed this series, I highly recommend this set. Just seeing it all again brought back so much, and seeing the people behind it bravely keeping the show going as best as they could gives the show an added humanity that, as a kid, I could only really see in the episodes that changed.

Now, details of the disks. Almost every episode has special features of some kind. Some are odd (everything but dialogue) and some got the royal treatment (commentaries both pre and during). No subtitles anywhere, but I didn't expect them. The video is good--at least, as good as I remember it being on my ratty TV. The sound is also nice (interesting to see how the music changed as they left prime time). Note, however, that there was some music slowdown in the first disk of my volume 3 or 4 (can't remember which). Dialogue is completely unaffected, but all of the music is slowed, as are the intro and end animations, but the epsidoes themselves are fine (music during the episodes are slowed too, though). The cases are metal, and I'm concerned about scratching (DEFINITELY keeping these!). The box is solid. The booklet has lots of great trivia. The bonus disk gives fans even MORE time with the cast and staff of the show--excellent.

I highly recommend this collection for old fans. I'm sure there's plenty here to make new fans as well! Enjoy!",1324771200,9,3229,4.5395189003436425
3772703,4,B001R1HEMI,My husband bought this set for himself.  He grew up on watching Ghostbusters as a kid so he said he had to get it.  He has watched a few of them already and smiles.  Thank you. It was a great buy.,1318896000,2,196,3.731707317073171
3772704,5,B001R1HEMI,"Does it need to be said? This series is truly awesome, and looks truly special on dvd format. I watched this show constantly back in the day when it was on tv. ""We now return to the REAL Ghostbusta's."" Yes, that is how the voice recording sounded; very cool.

I did not notice, at first, the major transition between Season 1 and 2 when the episodes became less serious when the show originally aired. The only part of the series I do not like as much is the SLIMER cartoon right at the tail end of the series. I am glad they included it for the complete set, but it's just so-so. My favorite part from this awesome set has to be the first season, which covers a good majority of the dvd sections. The season is very long, ending on Vol. 3 disc 3! SO many good episodes!

Season 2 has some awesome episodes as well, my personal favorites being Standing Room Only, The Brooklyn Triangle, and what I personally consider the series finale (before the series went to two 15-minute episodes each) The Halloween Door, TRULY awesome! ""The Boogaloo is BACK in town!""

The series is loaded with special features, such as Episode introductions with Writers/cast members, Music only options for episodes, and Visual commentaries for some episodes. I find all the commentaries/bonus features on the dvds very informative and entertaining! Very good bonuses for this set!

A true bonus feature, exclusive to this Box Firehouse Set, is the additional disc of hour-long commentaries with the voice actors and writers. The Bonus Disc Over Two Hours Of Exclusive Bonus Material includes:

Promo Pilot: Original 4-minute pilot for RGB- never before aired!

3772705,5,B001R1HEMI,"This was always one of my favourite cartoons when I was a kid. It has a lot of the fun and adventure of the live action movies. The animation is just incredible. Far better than most kids shows of the period. When the set original came out, it was released with tin cases that held the discs. But after a while, they started putting it out in regular plastic cases....which is a lot better for everyone, cool though the tin cases may be. Having normal cases, it will be a lot easier for you to get a replacement if something happens to the cases you have. The set of five cases is housed in a really cool box shaped like the Ghostbusters' firehouse HQ. On one side of the top of the box, there is a cool lenticular picture of the ""No Ghosts"" symbol that, when moved, looks like the ghost is trying to cut through the no sign. If you're a Ghostbusters fan, then you should pick up this set. Even if you're not so much a Ghostbusters fan and more just a general 80s animation fan, you should still get this set to see 80s animation at it's best.",1309910400,,1043,4.1940298507462686

When he was only 4 the second movie came out and I took him and his sisters to see it; they never missed the cartoon on Sat. morning; back in the day before we had cable.  I didn't get it for him for xmas last year because I thought the price would come down but it never has and I know this collection will be cherished by it's owners and never end up on eBay for practically nothing.  My son is loving his box set and the memories it brings him.,1294790400,2,721,3.9517241379310346

3772718,5,B001R1HEMI,"I have been waiting for this set for years and it finally arrived!
Watching the shows brought back so many memories and my little son seems to enjoy it as well. The set contains all the episodes and ton of little extras (which I thought were too much for me)

So far, the only thing that has been a little disappointing was the lack of subtitles and the episodes didn't look like they were cleaned up for digital release.",1287273600,,421,4.329113924050633

3772721,5,B001R1HEMI,"I jumped on this set when it was first available from Time-Life and spent that New Years weekend on a marathon viewing session.

I agree with the reviewer who complained about the way the firehouse box opens; I haven't dropped the whole thing on the floor yet but come close a few times.  The Steelbook cases could probably survive a drop; the outer box can't (I originally had it displayed on a shelf, but after a few close calls it migrated to be with the rest of the DVDs just off the floor).  The nubs that hold the discs in the cases don't always work well and require some finessing and swapping of discs to clip properly.

I've noticed a number of episodes have substantial grain, scratches, and other problems that should have been fixed in true restoration; ""A Fright At The Opera"" is one of my favorite episodes, but the image quality makes it almost unwatchable.  ""That Old College Spirit"" stutters on a few frames; nothing that adversely affects the episode, but annoying once you do notice it and a number of episodes have some moderate image ""ghosting"".  Given that most of us have been waiting 20+ years and that the original masters probably weren't stored with an eye on preservation, I can forgive the minor issues.  I'm amused by the coloring mistakes that were kept intact.  I also love the isolated music/effects tracks, and am working on stitching together clean copies of the incidental music.

I have two very young nephews that just got hooked on Ghostbusters, and now I can finally show them the cartoon as it was originally shown (no more low-quality streaming video).",1277510400,,1595,4.7086330935251794

BOOO!!!

3772724,5,B001R1HEMI,"When I first heard this set was coming out I was ecstatic I had to have it. It's all i talked about and man was it so worth it. I originally purchased it from Time Life for around 200 bucks. Whatever their price was and had it shipped to a friend's house so that I could ensure it didn't get lost...because I have no mailbox here and the Post Office is a lil &%$#@. Anyways I had to wait months because Time Life kept messin around with my payment and I had to keep calling them. But I finally received it around March.
When my friend handed me the box while we were at work I immediately went on break to go look at it in my car. Man was I not disappointed. The cases are made of hard tin or steel with the Guys on each of the 4 discs in different poses different colourings with Slimer or Janine on the final 5th disc. As soon as I got home I stole the Tv and began watching..I think I crammed 2 or 3 discs into every night. The picture is astounding..if anyone has watched it on youtube or tv it's nothing like that. i watch it on a regular television with a HD DvD player and had no complaints...other than the fact the talking logo comes up more than neccessary and it should have been able to be turned off.
The first 4 sets cover all the regular GhostBuster episodes and the final one covers all the Slimer and the Slimer and TRGB episodes. Which is very convenient having not liked them in the first place I didn't want the Slimer episodes breaking the good stuff.
There's a load of extras, including before commentary from the writer..it was really sweet seeing JMS and there are voice actor interviews and round table discussions as well. There are musical discussions and you can watch an episode as various actors and writers discuss that current episode as it plays.
The menus are top notch and really eye catching as well and never get tiring of seeing as they draw you into the show yer watching.
I didn't notice anything wrong at all with the production value either..the sound was bright, crisp and well done albeit it a lil loud sometimes but that's not a complaint better to be loud than overtly quiet. The cartoon looked and sounded exactly as I remembered it just better. I can't wait till Extreme GhostBusters finally comes out so I'll have both movies and both cartoons.
Now here's to waiting til the 3rd movie comes out.

If yer fan of The GhostBusters franchises and don't have this then you should be dissapointed in yourself as this belongs in your collection. I might buy another just to keep it sealed and protected, it'll be worth money someday.",1270252800,,2575,4.375782881002087
3772725,5,B001R1HEMI,"This collection is very nostalgic for me, being I grew up on it when I was a kid.  Anyone who enjoyed this series, and who can afford to buy it, should pick it up.  The first three seasons are great! Then at the end of the third series, where Arsenio Hall is no longer the voice, the writing/episodes become real cheesy and uncreative; a gradual building-up of Slimer's role becomes more and more dominant in the subsequent episodes (Peter suddenly becomes fond of the little ""spud,"" when in the earlier episodes he hated Slimer--which set a very humorous tone).
I'm probably overthinking this, but it's just my two cents.  I have no regrets about buying this collection--the packaging and set-up are top notch, and no shortcuts are taken.  ENJOY!",1268870400,,747,4.767441860465116

3772744,5,B001R1HEMI,"I grew up watching RGB every Saturday morning.  I loved the series.  For a cartoon, it is actually fairly intelligent.  All episodes are as they were on TV - introduced with the great familiar theme song and episode titles, ending with the credits and song.  I loved the included extras like commentary from the episode creators as to what spurred the ideas for each episode.  These were always very entertaining and I remember some of them really gave me the creeps when I was younger - The Boogeyman, The Sandman, When Halloween Was Forever, Mrs. Rogers Neighborhood, etc.

The firehouse box is awesome!!!  I love seeing Janine chewing her bubble gum on the lower floor while Slimer is upstairs seeking food as usual  lol  The box includes a nice color episode booklet that tells you a brief synopsis of the episode, title, and which disk it is on.

I was really impressed with the quality of the DVD cases inside the box - the exteriors are actually made out of METAL...almost unheard of these days.  I wish all DVD sets came like that.  This set will keep for a long time.

You will not be disappointed with this set if you are an RGB fan.  I waited 20 years for this set to come out!!  SO HAPPY!  :)  Just BUY IT - you will not regret it.  FANTASTIC SET!",1258588800,2,1259,4.423580786026201
3772745,5,B001R1HEMI,"I've owned this Real Ghostbusters set now since November 2008 and watched all 25 discs in the spring of 2009. I would like to preface my review by saying that I am a huge 80s cartoon collector and this set is by far the nicest in its overall design that I own. The set is a compact collection and fits ever so nicely on a bookshelf - it's about five regular dvd cases wide. If you own the Shout! Factory G.I. Joe and Transformers Complete Sets it is nothing near the size of those beasts. Some may actually look at the RGB set and exclaim how small it is. As soon as I opened it in November 2008 I know I did, because back then I had paid over a $180 for it - ""I paid $180 for this little thing!"" At first glance it didn't seem worth the coin but as I started to view the collection, and upon finishing it in May of 2009, I can tell you it was worth every penny. And now here you can get it for $113, free shipping, and no tax in some states! This price almost temps me to buy another to keep sealed and have place in a bank deposit!

What you get:
The set includes all 147 episodes of The Real Ghostbusters (which include all episodes from Slimer! And The Real Ghostbusters) on 24 dvds - 5 dvds each in cases 1-4 and 4 dvds in case 5 and then there is the bonus 25th dvd in a cardboard cd-type sleeve w/ artwork. Each ""case"" is a very nice steelbook case with clear dvd tray inserts so you can see the artwork on the inner-back-side of the steelbook. Steelbooks are very strong and I believe are made from some sort of aluminum but with plastic dvd tray inserts. The disc art is basically the same for each case - the four Ghostbusters on the first 4 dvds per case and then Slimer or Janine (or both) on the 5th dvd, and this is repeated but with different background colors for each case.
The episodes are supposed to be restored and uncut. I've seen nothing to dispute the latter, but the former is suspect. These Real Ghostbusters episodes, picture-wise, are some of the worst I own, except maybe Transformers. Each episode has a lot of snap, crackle and pop, grain and some times the colors are wonky. If you've ever watched BCI's He-Man or Shout's GI Joe set and are expecting that type of picture....I'm sorry. But, truly, I don't mind. The look really brings you back to the 80s and gives off that 80s feel. And just to throw this out - I run my cartoons via a 360, over HDMI, into a Samsung 46"" 1080p LCD - this may factor into what I'm seeing. I guess I just feel that Time-LIFE was misleading when they marketed the set as ""restored"". However, maybe they looked much worse and they were truly restored. Also, some of the episodes have audio that either runs slightly too fast or slightly too slow and this may drive some fans nuts. And I didn't find one episode that had glitches either.

MISC:
Over 12 hours of bonus features are peppered throughout the set but the actual bonus disc is a treat. The bonus dvd has the original promotional pilot for The Real Ghostbusters - this thing is about 4-5 minutes long and was used to sell the show in a boardroom. I believe the disc has all of the interviews (found throughout the set) uncut here as well - J. Michael Straczynski (creator - Babylon 5) is probably the most well known and most entertaining to watch.
In the set there are 21 on-camera commentary tracks with producers, voice actors, writers, animators and production personnel, 5 exclusive documentaries, 86 episode introductions (that are down-right goofy - Straczynski's are the best though), and the set comes with, depending on how you count pages, a 48-page booklet that includes episode synopses, trivia and art for every episode. There is some minor fluff too but it's not a worth mention.

Pros:
You get every episode of The Real Ghostbusters and Slimer! And The Real Ghostbusters, uncut, in one sturdy, compact box-set that takes up little room in your dvd collection but adds great value. The bonus material is more than a fan could ever want and then some, and can be downright overwhelming at times, especially if you watched the video commentary too.

Cons:
If I were Time-LIFE, and if money and time were not a factor, I would have really tried to have the episodes cleaned up better (has anyone seen the Shout! Factory G.I. Joe Complete Set...WOW!), and have the audio correct on those episodes that have an audio-speed issue. The other thing I would change is the disc's cover art. I know why the disc art is the way it is, because Time-LIFE wants to sell each volume (case) individually, but I think it would have been awesome for the complete set if there was special disc art with a prominent/sub character having their own disc. Here's my list - a Peter Venkman disc, Egon Spengler disc, Ray Stantz, Winston Zeddemore, Janine Melnitz, Louis Tully, Slimer, Walter Peck, Stay Puft, Sandman, Samhain, Cathulhu, Boogieman, Grundel, Boogaloo, Ghostmaster, Ghash (Mr. Ugly), Furnace Monster, Precious, Wat, Toy Ghost, Killerwatt, Morganan, Professor Dweeb and the bonus disc would just have the logo.

Overall, this is a must have for Real Ghostbusters fans. Period.",1256256000,64,5099,4.502159827213823
3772746,5,B001R1HEMI,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? The steelbook cases are very nice, quite thin and with good artwork. The discs have decent artwork, though to be fair it does seem a bit grainy (but getting past that it's quite nice). The set comes in ""firehouse"" packaging, of which the top slides upward to reveal the contents. It comes with an episode guide booklet. There are plenty of extras toeb had on the discs, including the unaired original pilot episode, apparently. This set is definitely a must-have for completists or fans of the show, or parents who want their kids to see a high quality animated show from the 80's.
