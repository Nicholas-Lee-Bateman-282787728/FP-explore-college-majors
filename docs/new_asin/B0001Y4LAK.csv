8018077,5,B0001Y4LAK,"I was very surprised to find ""The Archie Show"" on DVD.  I was skeptical that it might be the same quality as a lot of TV based shows released by a small distributor on DVD or VHS. You know the kind, the prints are well worn, the sound fuzzy and the picture is blurry or has no colour.  Nostalgia Ventures has done an excellent job presenting this classic late '60s cartoon.  The prints used are prestine, and very clear.  This disc contains 3 episodes of ""The Archie Show"" from 1968.  The fourth episode is ""The U.S. of Archie"", which was an incarnation of the series from 1974 where the Archie gang reinact points of American history.  For special features there is an Archie trivia game, scene selections, and an episode of ""Archie's Funhouse"" from 1970, which was the cartoon version of ""Laugh-in"", where the Archie and the gang do comedy and skits for an hour. In conclusion, it is great to see some of the episodes available on DVD.  This show is so '60s, but it is so much fun to watch even after all of these years.  I have not seen ""The Archie Show"" & others since the mid '70s!  The songs and the dance of the week really show the era in which this show was launched in.  There are 3 other ""Archie & Friends"" DVDs available, which are titled ""Archie's Classic Cartoons"", ""Sabrina The Teenage Witch"", and ""Archie's TV Funnies"".  If you are a fan of classic cartoons from the '60s and '70s, this DVD will not disappoint!",1086912000,28,1427,4.42911877394636
