6015960,5,B00FNRA0KA,"Maverick was one of the top 5 television westerns ever made IMO, along with Wagon Train, Rawhide, Gunsmoke and The Virginian.  The show was about 2 brothers, Bret Maverick (James Garner) and Bart Maverick (Jack Kelly), who were professional gamblers and con-artists.  Most of the episodes usually featured one of the brothers, in some interesting dilemma or other.  But, some of the best episodes were those in which the 2 brothers team together to pull off a con.  Roger Moore joined the cast as their British cousin Beauregarde Maverick for 16 episodes over the last two seasons.  5 Stars for this great show.

However, I give 1 star for the way in which Warner Brothers has changed to releasing the show as DVD-Rs.  That's bad enough, but why couldn't they just offer the final 3 seasons all at once?  This tells me that there's a good chance seasons 4 and 5 will never be offered for release (even on demand).",1383091200,56,913,4.6625
6015961,1,B00FNRA0KA,"I too am holding off purchasing the ""Maverick"" Third Season video collection due to the price.  I have purchased the first two seasons and ""Maverick"" is one of my favorite series, but NOT at this price.",1382918400,24,202,4.611111111111111
6015962,1,B00FNRA0KA,"The problem with Maverick: The Complete Third Season is that the manufacturer of the package has changed the way they offer it to the buying public. The Discs are now produced on demand and are being sold somewhat exclusively through their own website store. A store that will not ship to Canadian shoppers(of which I am one).  The DVD set is being sold here on Amazon.com as more of an afterthought. And might I add being sold at an astronomical price compared to the previous two releases before.  All this applies to another series of Mr. Garners, ""Nichols: The Complete series"". On demand and highly overpriced.  It's a shame that Warners has gone this direction. Mr. Garner has many fans who love his work and purchase the DVDs of his shows. It seems like a very awkward and disheartening way to treat fans and collectors.",1382659200,97,827,4.689655172413793
6015963,1,B00FNRA0KA,Because of price I am holding off on buying maverick season three. I am surprised they didn't put it out in two parts charging $30.00 per part. It doesn't even look like James Garner on the front of the DVD,1382486400,21,206,4.175
6015964,5,B00FNRA0KA,Maverick deserves 5 stars because it was and is a great show with James Garner and Jack Kelly. I bought it despite the ridiculous price only because I have collected the previous two seasons and it is my favorite western. It's amazing that these companies get greedy for more money. The first two season were reasonable but the third season is not right. They did this with Perry Mason and Cheyenne as well. I wasn't able to buy all of these seasons because of cost. Having to pay tax on this set as well brings up the price as well. I hope future seasons of Maverick will be more reasonable.,1382486400,74,592,4.390909090909091
6015965,1,B00FNRA0KA,I am giving maverick 1 star because of the price. i am sure the third season will be excellent just as season 1 & 2 but how can this price be justified. Double the price of season 2.come on amazon give us a good price. Frederick.,1382313600,27,229,4.0
6015966,1,B00FNRA0KA,"Maverick was a great TV show, so the third season with James Garner and Jack Kelly still was full of entertainment.  The problem with this DVD set is that it was put on writeable DVDs, not production type.  As such about half the episodes will skip or not play on most of my two Panasonic players.  Warner Brothers should have put out production DVDs like the first two seasons.  I would advise anyone to skip the 3rd and 4th seasons until good DVD copies are available.",1500854400,3,470,4.430232558139535

6015968,4,B00FNRA0KA,"Maverick: The Complete Third Season is a collection of all 26 episodes from the shows 1959-1960 season. The show stars James Garner as Bret Maverick and Jack Kelly as his brother Bart, gamblers who manage to get themselves mixed up with bad guys, seductive women, and awkward, often comic situations. The show was different from other Westerns of the time because of its light touch. The brothers weren't hardened gunslingers or lawmen, making their focus in a prime time Western unusual. But the formula worked, and the show ran on ABC on Sunday nights from 1957 to 1962.

Season Three opens with the episode Pappy, in which Garner, in a dual role, plays his own father. Other third season episodes feature Bret getting blackmailed into serving a six-month term as sheriff, Bart being accused of murdering a young cowboy, an elaborate heist involving a gang of bad guys, an Indian massacre, an eye-for-an-eye drama of vengeance, a rainstorm stranding gambling rivals Gentleman Jack and Bart in a small roadhouse, a political assassination plot, a secret tunnel leading to a bank vault, and the brothers trying to referee a long-standing family feud.

Guest stars in Season Three include Buddy Ebsen, Edgar Buchanan, Henry Daniell, Troy Donohue, Adam West, Joel Grey, and Robert Redford.

There are no bonus materials on the 6-disc DVD set, The unrated episodes are presented in the full-frame format.",1497312000,,1401,5.0562770562770565

6016010,5,B00FNRA0KA,"As I stated I love Maverick...not sure if this will be my last season to buy.  Around the 4th Season they added Roger Moore as a cousin I believe, and seems like James Garner was doing more movies during that time period, or very few Maverick episodes.  I streamed a lot of Maverick episodes back when streaming began on Netflix so I have seen all of these episodes again after many, many years!",1447113600,,395,4.397260273972603
6016011,4,B00FNRA0KA,The third season was before James Garner faded from Maverick. The writing and acting was still excellent and the reason that Maverick is a classic.

6016012,5,B00FNRA0KA,"One of my favorite Westerns when it first aired, it has aged very very well. This was James Garners' last season as ""Bret Maverick. "" The show continued for two more seasons without him. ( Jack Kelly was also great as a Maverick ) . Garner returned to the roe in the tv series ""Bret Maverick "" and the ""Young Maverick "" pilot.

6016014,5,B00FNRA0KA,"Many of the hour long shows from this era suffered from a lot of dead time on screen, and really needed to be a half hour. In the case of Maverick, you don't want it to end. The plots are timeless. Just when you think things are moving too slow, it twists and turns so fast the roller coaster ride is over quickly. James made a TV career out of keeping the watcher thoroughly involved for an entire hour of non-stop entertainment. Rockford Files has been dominating the nostalgia channels now for years, and at the prime time watching hours. I haven't seen Maverick on the airwaves for a while now, but should be airing. Maverick is so similar to Rockford it is scary, in a good way. How about a Mission Impossible, western style, OK, not quite, but you get the idea.

Maverick's plots are great, bad guys are bad, it is funny, it is serious, and the women are all the most beautiful TV actresses of that time period. Many up and coming actors, male or female, started on shows like Maverick. This was the last season starring James Garner(some kind of dispute? or too popular at the movies?). Jack Kelly stars in the 4th season, and Jack is really great too. I wasn't going to get the 4th season, but I'm rethinking that Jack Kelly is that good. They usually alternate between weeks, but many times we are surprised that the other brother shows up to contort the plot or help the other out of a jam. Great show!!",1441584000,,1413,4.393129770992366

Conversely, imagine my disappointment--no that is too mild--my full-blown anger at the rediculous price for Seasons 3 and 4.  And it isn't even a bona-fide DVD.  It's a lousy DVD-R.

Shame on you, Amazon!  You are better than that.  The idea of grabbing for all that the market will bear is not becoming to you.  If this is a new attitude on your part, it is no wonder that your stock has plummeted over $100/share in the past few months.

As to the price, yes it's too bad they aren't as inexpensive as seasons 1 & 2 ... but then, I remember when I was paying Columbia House $25 to get a VHS tape with 2 episodes on it.  By that measurement, $50 for 26 episodes is a steal!

About the episodes themselves: the series had really hit it's stride by this point.  Every episode was more than ""just an hour of TV"", it's like getting 26 classic movies.  Both James Garner and Jack Kelly are in top form when apart and the episodes they do together are always a treat.

All the wit and charm that made James Garner shine as a star, all the charisma comes to play and develop as you watch these Maverick episodes.

Maverick  Volume 3 is Maverick running full tilt out, having established its unique sensibilities.

Jack Kelly often gets short shrift as Brother Bart when Maverick is written about, but he's just fine in his episodes. It just isn't a role made for the right actor with the right spark to make it brighten the screen. Jack seemed to mostly take it all with good grace.

One more plea to Warner Archives, before they start putting the private eye series onto disc: restore the bumpers!

I've written this before, I'm not stopping now.

No one did bumpers between commercials better than Warners.

Warners did them better than Disney!

And the company from ""the entertainment capital of the world"" never did it better than they did on the detective shows. The theme-song came up. The announcer's voice was sure and clear. The title of the episode was against the Sunset Strip locale. All this told you that you were watching something special.

If they can get the bumpers into Peter Gunn, Dobie Gillis and Hawaii 5-0, then why not get them from the company that showed them how to do it best?
