3556491,1,B001EO5JSE,"Ok, maybe this is better than nothing but what is the hold up. They are already releasing iCarly on DVD but we can't get complete season box sets of Drake and Josh. This is one of Nick's best shows and from the countless reruns it must be one of the most popular, Until they make season sets they won't see a penny of my money.",1220227200,40,327,4.046153846153846

3556495,2,B001EO5JSE,"Just to let you, the reader, know, this is my first time ever leaving a product review, so bear with me.

Anyways, I recently saw that Amazon was about to obtain a new shipment of The Best of Seasons 1 & 2 of Drake & Josh DVDs. Waiting anxiously for a while for this day to come again, I ordered one straight away. To my surprise when I received the DVD, the packaging and artwork was re-done, as well as fitting the episodes on two discs rather than three like seeing before. As I entered the Episode Selection screen, I was very disappointed as I noticed that a few of the episodes that were listed in various reviews for this DVD, like Pilot, Dune Buggy, and the exclusive only to this DVD release episode, #1 Fan, were removed! I paid $30.00 hoping that I would get all of the episodes that were listed, but I was let down. Also note that Amazon doesn't actually have the episodes contained on this DVD listed, so my only means of figuring out what was on this DVD was to look through the reviews section. On a lighter note, the episodes on the DVD are in significantly better quality than the episodes you can purchase from iTunes, so that's at least a slight let up...",1484092800,9,1174,4.3122171945701355

3556503,4,B001EO5JSE,"I Love Drake & Josh and I started watching it with my neice because she was watching it and now I love watching it all by myself.  I have been waiting for all of the episodes to be released on dvd, so I was so excited when I found out it was being released.  I gave only 4 stars out of 5 because I don't understand why the complete set wasn't released.  This dvd set is very expensive for not having all of the episodes on them.  If they were not going to release all of the episodes then I think they could have went down on the price.  I also gave 4 out of 5 stars because the dvd seems cheaply made to me, when you go to pick different episodes you highlight which episode you want to go to and it highlights in a yellow color and sometimes with the glare of the tv I can hardly see which episode it is highlighting.  Another problem I had was the dvd set is seasons 1 & 2, but on the 3rd disk in the set on the opening screen it is labeled wrong it says it is season 3 & 4 on the set that I received. All and all I love Drake & Josh so I guess I am happy that they released some of the episodes rather then none of the episodes.  Although I will still be waiting on the complete set to be released.",1231286400,27,1202,3.8225806451612905
3556504,1,B001EO5JSE,"The shows are great, but these disks will not play on all U.S. DVD players, especially if they have any recording capabilities. It doesn't work on our Sony DVD/VHS combo recorder. I'm guessing this has to do with people making illegal copies, but it would hardly be profitable to copy these shows to a VHS tape and then back again to a DVD. Think of the quality it would produce. The editoral review does mention (wish I'd noticed this before) that the disks will only work in ""play-only"" DVD machines. Hope this isn't a trend with DVDs.",1230681600,19,537,4.546391752577319
3556505,4,B001EO5JSE,"I just got it today in the mail about 30 minutes ago, so I've yet to watch it, but these are the episodes listed on the back:

DISC 1
- Pilot
- Dune Buggy
- Grammy
- Two Idiots and a Baby
- Mean Teacher

DISC 2
- First Crush
- Honor Council
- Movie Job
- Little Diva
- #1 Fan

DISC 3
- The Bet
- Football
- Smart Girl
- Drew and Jerry
- Pool Shark

So, the episodes **NOT** included from Seasons 1 and 2 are:
- Believe Me, Brother
- Guitar
- Blues Brothers
- Driver's License
- The Gary Grill

Only five missing episodes! That's really good! It's almost a complete season set! But I only gave it 4 stars because they could have easily just added the remaining five episodes and made it an actual complete season set. Plus, it's a bit expensive for what it is, and there are no special features whatsoever. Other that, it seems great!",1230508800,23,833,3.9939759036144578
3556506,3,B001EO5JSE,"I just recently discovered this show on Nick. I was excited to find the DVD set, but when I realized it was not the complete seasons, I was very disappointed. I feel cheated! Especially since my favorite episode ""Blue's Brothers"" was not included in any of the sets. When it says, ""The Best Of Seasons 1 and 2"", I think that episode would qualify. It's better than nothing but I want them all.",1230076800,14,393,4.397260273972603
