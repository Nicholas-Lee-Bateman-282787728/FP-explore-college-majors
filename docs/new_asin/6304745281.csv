936395,5,6304745281,"Fong Sai Yuk brings the life of the legendary martial arts master to the big screen with Jet Li in the leading role in what constitutes one of the greatest martial arts movies ever made.

The story begins with Jet defending a girl's modesty and, hence, being challenged to a competition pitting him in such events as the long jump and the sprint relay, which witnesses him eliciting the girl whose modesty he rescued into the race for want of an extra person to fulfill the conditions of the race which requires three participants. Having defeated the bullies in a fair competition, he surrenders his medal to the girl as a present.

Then, the story progresses with Jet Li participating in a tournament with a rich man's wife, with excellent skills in wushu, in an attempt to win the daughter's hand in marriage as that constitutes the price for winning. Here we are treated to one of the most innovative and creative fight scenes ever captured on film that aptly demonstrates Jet Li's unparalled skill in martial arts, where he easily defeats the rich man's wife only to deliberately throw the match after catching a glimpse of what constitutes one of the ugliest women on earth, whom he didn't realize was a mere stand-in for the real price.

However, having heard of Jet's defeated, his mother, challenges the rich man's wife in an attempt to restore honour to the Sai Yuk family, and, in so doing, finds herself irrevocably bound to the pledge of marriage that comprise the condition of the tournament, having disguised herself as a man.

Sai Yuk is, hence, forced into the marriage, which when he comes to realize involves the girl, whose virtue he had rescued, causes him extreme jubilance.

However, Sai Yuk's father, being a wanted rebel by the emperor, is captured, spurring Jet to come to his rescue and, hence, engaging in the climactic battle that ends the movie.

Fong Sai Yuk is without a doubt one of the greatest martial arts movies ever made.",1390521600,,1959,4.730205278592376

Jet Li's fighting is always great to watch but this role as a charming but rather spoiled boy hero really shows off his comedic acting skills.  The Fong family is hilarious and the mom almost steals the show.  That said, while this Dynasty version at least has original language with subtitle option (a must for me), it also has some scenes cut which is a major flaw. why??!!",1328400000,,502,4.144329896907217

~Shauns movie review",1320192000,,131,4.24
936403,5,6304745281,"Jet Li's most intricate moves are basically hidden from us Westerners: he decided to take the ""writ in stone"" traditional kung fu film and totally stretch its limits without breaking the mold-- much harder to do, in my opinion, than shattering it the way Bruce Lee did. Thus, relationships between a hardline father, a somewhat whacked-out mother, and a confused-but-talented son are classic, often slapstick, comedy, while the motivation for action is extreme, often sadistic. But when the action comes, it's astoundingly thematic, balletic, and violent. Can't really explain it, but I love it in films like this, its sequel,and 'Tai Chi Master' and the entire 'Wong Fei Hung' series. Through Li, you get to see the Past, Present, and Future of this genre all at once in every film. The man is a remarkable artist in every sense of the word.",1310256000,3,842,4.936619718309859

936423,3,6304745281,"I really enjoy Jet Li's performance in this film. Lots of laughing & action moments. Unfortunately, as the other reviewer points out the BD transfer is quite bad. The film is soft & has plenty grains. If you already own the DVD copy, probably you can do away without this copy. PQ is slightly better than DVD only but for those with big projector screen (mine is 110"") it's a pain in the eyes to watch this film.

Though the English audio is in Dolby Digital 5.1, I'm very disappointed with the original Cantonese audio that comes in Dolby Digital 2.0 only. This is really sloppy work. Hopefully in future the studio can improve & do a re-master copy that give justice to this film.

I loved the character of Sai Yuk's kungfu expert, majong playing, conniving, loyal mother. She has my vote for best character in a martial arts movie.",1299801600,,274,4.934782608695652
936425,4,6304745281,"What a great movie. Another solid offering from Jet Li in the Prime of Hong Kong Cinema, Directed by Corey Yuen. It is lots of fun to watch, as all of the characters are silly to some extent, as well as containing fast paced exciting Kung Fu.
Jet Li's character is the Legendary martial artist Fong Sai Yuk, and is portrayed similiarly to Jackie Chan's version of Wong Fei Hung in the Drunken Master Films. In fact that is probably the best comparision, as both films portray chinese folk heroes in their youth, as N'er Do Wells.
But that is really here nor there. This film is meant to be taken lightly, I believe, and is an absolute blast to watch when all considerations of Seriousness and Anachronism are thrown out the Window.",1283904000,,731,4.503759398496241
936426,1,6304745281,"Maybe i'm missing something but just like Tai Chi Master there really is no discernible improvement in the picture quality from the blu-ray compared to the dvd. This is honestly a waste of money if you already own the dvd; the up convert of the dvd looks as good as the blu-ray.  I see a possible trend with Dragon Dynasty similar to what happened with the advent of dvd's: initially put out a shoddy copy on blu-ray, then follow-up with a remastered, true high definition version and in the process screw the consumer into buying the new and improved version.",1277251200,36,560,4.6

I've seen this movie in the theater several times. I can tell you that this is not only one of Jet Li's finest films, but also one of the real gems of HK movies, and one of the best period martial arts films of all time.

The characters are fun and charming, the acting full of energy.  The story and script is humorous and heroic.  The sets and period evocations are flawless.

Of course, the fighting is incredible: full use is made of many large set-pieces, similar to Iron Monkey and Wing Chun. And Jet is at the pinnacle of his grace and power, as well as boyish charm wedded to striking nobility and screen presence.

I advise all lovers of HK martial arts to see this brilliant film made during the modern height of the Hong Kong cinema glory days.  And then come back and stick a 5-star review in here so this wonderful movie doesn't get done in by The Legend's bad reputation.",1242604800,40,1076,4.426395939086294

I have been collecting JET Li movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to ""Americanize"" and ""Control"". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market.

First and foremost dubbing of any of these movies takes out the authentic flavor out of the original making the comedy, villiany, romance and any other kind of human emotion sound, look and feel pathetically lame. That's the big and only difference between these 'B'grade action movies from Honkong and a slicker production like ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" (slicker only, read my review of CTHD for details on that fiasco). This is no serious martial art and the comedy like those innumerable chinese martial art movies, SUCKS. I can only give some credit for the flexible acrobatics.

The really enjoyed this movie...the main comment being that they had never seen anything like it.  They were not expecting the humor, and the Lego Set fight scene that spills into the crowd really impresssed them.  Special effects help the stunts but one has to be incredibly strong and nimble to be able to pull off the effects.

Jet Li is so fast that you almost belive he could beat up that many people at once.,1085184000,,292,3.816666666666667
936455,5,6304745281,"While this is the story of Fong Sai Yuk, he is a very different chatacter than that of Wong Fei Hung of Once Upon A Time In China fame.  Both, I believe, were part of the heroes known as the Ten Tigers of Canton, but the association ends there.",1072051200,,244,3.979591836734694
936456,2,6304745281,"If, like me, you were introduced to the stupendously cool Let Li via the ""Once Upon A Time In China"" series, you know him to be not only a highly skilled and gifted kung fu master, but a nuanced and convincing actor as well.
Accordingly, slapstick comedy and all-around mugging are not necessarily a weird thing to see Li participating in (there's a little in the UOATIC movies, in fact). He can do the range thing, including the light-touch thing, very well indeed. But for me, at least in the Buena Vista ""Jet Li Series"" DVD version, this movie is just plain silly.
I don't mean silly like a toddler is silly (i.e., endearing & cute), but silly as in ""implausible and annoying."" This is coming from someone who happily suspends disbelief when faced with blatant but cool wire-work and other common kung-fu-movie indulgences. Those are just part of the form, as is, for that matter, a *modest* amount of broad humor. But to me, the gags, conceits, and plot of this film just don't cut it for a Jet Li vehicle.
Other reviewers have mentioned how cool it is to see Josephine Siao wreaking havoc on bad guys again, and I agree, but in one scene we see her badly bruised after a beating by her husband (whom we're later expected to revere as a noble patriot). I'm sure there's a cultural/historical disconnect involved in my own reaction to that scene, but to me it's an unsettling and jarring one -- there just isn't anything funny or light about domestic abuse, historically-plausible or no.
And then there's Li's performance. Gone is the ultra-cool ueber-controlled poise of Wong Fei-Hung: as Fong Sai Yuk, a carefree teenager (until the fighting starts, naturally), Li isn't exactly ineffective -- aside from the obvious age difference between actor & character -- rather, for me it's sort of *uncomfortable* to see mighty Li cracking jokes, mugging goofy smiles, and engaging in shtick with the family servant (who has big Godfather-calibre wads of cotton jammed down his cheeks for no discernible reason).
This is uncomfortable not because it's comedy, but because by my standards it's pretty *lame* comedy, and ""lame"" and ""Jet Li"" simply don't go together. Li makes a valiant effort at putting on a good face, but there's no saving some of this material.
The English dubbing doesn't help any of this, though I suppose it could be worse. The real problem with the dubbing is that it can't be turned off: this is an extremely feature-poor DVD, obviously intended for the very most clueless segments of the English-speaking market.
I can only hope that the original version (entitled ""Fong Sai Yuk"") is as good as others say. I'd be interested to see it, but not before cleansing my palate with some Hong Kong versions of other Li films I haven't seen yet.
If you haven't seen this movie yet, DON'T START WITH THE ""Jet Li Series"" VERSION. And if you haven't seen Jet Li at all, start with ""Once Upon a Time in China."" It's the standard by which I measure other Li films, and you can't go wrong with that one.
By the way, ""The Legend"" (i.e., even this version) does have its moments. The final DVD-chapter in which the climactic battle occurs is mighty exciting stuff indeed, with an unexpected appearance by a sword-wielding and mind-bogglingly debonnair Adam Cheng.
And Josephine Siao's combat sequences are also pretty riveting (no pun intended) -- there's even one bit where she and her son fight side-by-side in perfectly synchronized mirror-image choreography that I found to be particularly entertaining. If only the stuff immediately before and after that sequence were as effective.",1048204800,,3591,4.821717990275527
936457,1,6304745281,"This movie is awesome.
Now that i've gotten that out of the way, the reason for such a low rating (if only there were negative stars) is the ... quality of the DVD release.  Dimension Home Video, even after paying the license for this movie, senselessly doesn't include the original soundtracks (cantonnese or mandarin), opting for a POS english dub whose translation sounds more like something from an afternoon cartoon than a very very good movie.  Although the video quality is fine, it completely baffles me why they didn't include the original languages.

936459,4,6304745281,"I've been reading through the reviews of others and can see that people either hated or liked this film.
Personally I liked it! The fight scenes were well done, and Jet Li does do a good job as a comedic actor.  It's a nice change to see him in a light hearted role.  His mother played by Josephine Siao also lends alot of comdeic relief.
You'll read in the following reviews about poor editing, and dubbing.  I've never seen the original version of this film, Fong Sai Yuk, but I was satisfied with the Dimension release.  I found the dubbing to be much better then the Fist of Legend release, and the story much more intelligent than The Defender.
So here's the long and the short of it.  If you're a die hard Kung Fu fan, try to get Fong Sai Yuk.  If you want a fun Kung Fu flick without worrying about subtitles, try The Legend. You won't be disappointed.  I only wish Dimensoin had an optional Chinese subtitle feature.(reason for the 4 stars)
  The Legend 2 just came out, so if you like this release, I would also recommend the second story of Fong Sai Yuk, and his mom. It's well dubbed, and funnier in my opinion!",1014163200,,1122,4.330143540669856

Why I have no idea. Please do yourself a favor and seek out the original version called ""Fong Sai Yuk"". Even if you do not understand Chinese you will understand the story well enough from the subtitles and you will enjoy it much better. Trust me on this. Do not encourage [the film industry]in their butchering of quality movies. The original version of this movie is a wonderful mix of action and comedy which I would rate 5 stars.

The voice acting is mediocre and especially fails for Fong Sai Yuk's mom who is the funniest character in the movie. They cut a lot out. It is mostly jokes, but they also cut out some fighting parts which they must have felt would be inappropriate (Fong Sai Yuk fights using the dead body of his friend as a weapon).
My advice. ...Search around for a Chinese language version. I am usually happy with dubbing. I wasn't too upset about the cuts made in the theatrical release of Iron Monkey (Ironically, both cuts removed a scene of a women spraying water out of her mouth), but this brutal edit of Fong Sai Yuk bugged me.",1005955200,10,988,4.375

So when the American release version became available, with Li at the helm of the remastering, I was ecstatic! I immediately purchased the DVD and ran home to watch it.
My God, was I dissappointed. The English dub, while being okay, was *completely* different from the original; scenes cropped or deleted altogether, and the story was not only much different than the original, was nearly incoherent! I sold this version as fast as I could, and located an original version.

936478,4,6304745281,"This is the only Jet Li movie that I have watched with the exception of The Black Mask. He is quite engaging with his million dollar smile and lightning quick kicks and punches. This film is loaded with memorable characters besides Fong Sai Yuk (Jet Li). The father of the earstwhile bride has one of the most expressive faces in Hong Kong films. I wish I could tell you his name, but it escapes me at the moment. What really got my attention was the surprise (for me) of finding one of my favorite martial arts movie stars, Josephine Siao (Fangfang Xiao). Ms. Siao is absolutely one of the finest and most familiar of the Kung Fu fighters of 60's during the heyday of this genre. She is just as beautiful and deadly as ever and her comic timing is impeccable. She and her son get into much trouble throughout the movie, acting as best buddies rather than mother and son. In one sequence, Ms. Saoi fights, in the obligatory Kung Fu tournament, disquised as her son and older brother to Fong Sai Yuk. The winner of the contest will be awarded the hand of the daughter of the local rich tyrant. To our surprise (not) she/he wins the tournement and the heart of the wife (played by Sibelle Hu) of the tyrant. This sub-plot made the movie for me.
All in all a great period film with colorful costumes, wonderful sets and shooting locations, and outstanding gymnastics and fighting. While there are some pretty outlandish action that makes suspension of disbelief a little difficult at times, the fighting scenes were really great.
I highly recommend this film to fans of Jet Li and martial arts movies. For others who are unfamiliar with this genre, this is a great starting point to move forward with Jet Li and Jackie Chan or backward to the Hong Kong films of the sixties.

936480,1,6304745281,"After I saw Fong Sai Yuk, I thought that it came very close to being the best Jet Li movie ever, challenged only by Swordsman 2 and Tai Chi Master.  The Legend can hardly be viewed as the same film as Fong Sai Yuk.  The picture quality is excellent, just as it was for the Twin Warriors/Tai Chi Master release.
Yet the same major problem with Twin Warriors is present here, and it is so much worse.
Firstly there are some edits.  Some of these are small and there is no logical reason why it should have been cut.  Some cuts are major that spanned minutes of the original movie.
The second is the main reason I would give this movie zero stars if that were possible. NO ORIGINAL LANGUAGE TRACK.  This sin is unforgivable.  To compound this error, the English actors don't know what they are doing.  They seem to be confused and sound serious in the comedic moments, and vise versa.  I fail to see how the publisher could justify this, especially when the original track exists, all they would have to do is put it on the DVD.
Overall there is no reason to buy this movie, especially when the Chinese version is region free and subtitled in English.  Do a little searching ..to find it (zshops or auctions work well).  Please do not support this.. of a good movie.",992217600,5,1263,4.381974248927039

And one of the most progressive.  See Jet Li tear it up in utterly badass fighting scenes.  See his mom whip some tail.  See Sibelle Hu chase a woman she thinks is a guy.  This is HK comedy at its very best!  If I could only recommend 2 movies to women and martial arts fans...they would be Twin Warriors (Tai Chi Master) and this one - The Legend!

936483,4,6304745281,"I recently saw the english dubbed version of Fong Sai Yuk (The Legend), after watching the original subtitled version.
First, let me say- Disney is way off on the R rating of this film. There is no nudity, coarse language, or blood and guts. There is violence, but it never goes past the point of something you wouldn't see in an action cartoon show on Saturday mornings. It's punching, hitting, and kicking. There's hardly any scenes with knives or swords or other deadly weapons. Not that I'm saying it's cool to beat people up, it's just never used in bad taste.
Overall, I was sorely disappointed with the dubbed version. However, my friends (who never saw the subtitled version) really enjoyed it- so I gave it a higher rating of 4 stars. For me, it's one thing to ruin the dialog and music from the original movie, but deleting scenes goes a step way too far. Here's a few missing scenes from the english dubbed version:
1. Fong Sai Yuk (Jet Li's character) curling his mom's hair. It may seem trivial, but without it my friends didn't understand the close relationship between the two characters. Not to mention, it's a funny scene. 2. The mother's uncontrollable orgasmic interpretive dance reaction to the father reciting poetry. It's an ongoing joke in the film and with these scenes cut out and dialog missing, there is a real confusing part in the end for people who haven't seen the subtitled version. In the subtitled version Fong Sai Yuk and his lovely new bride ride into the sunset. As they ride off, Fong Sai Yuk recites poetry to her. With the dialog changed and without seeing the previous deleted scene, my friends  were confused to why Fong Sai Yuk's new bride was going into deadly convulsions on her horse as she rode away. 3. When Fong Sai Yuk's Mom wins the fight to win the daughter's hand in marriage, she is forced to sign a marriage contract with a knife to her throat. When Tiger Lu can't get her hand open to put her thumb print, he just shoves her fist into an ink bowl and just stamps her fist on the marriage contract. Great physical comedy. Later on at Fong Sai Yuk's home, the mother has the palace guard's swords to her throat as ransom- which is how they manage to capture Fong Sai Yuk. A scene that was also deleted. 4. Tiger Lu trying to make friends with Fong Sai Yuk by joining him in making terrible music in the palace courtyard. This is a hilarious scene! Fong Sai Yuk is determined to make his father in law to be (Tiger Lu) hate him. He is doing this to get out of marrying his daughter, or who he believes is Tiger Lu's daughter. At the same time, Tiger Lu is trying to gain acceptance by marrying his daughter to a popular young man from the town (Fong Sai Yuk). To cheese off Tiger Lu, Fong Sai Yuk starts playing pots and pans in the palace courtyard at the break of dawn and chants some terrible off key tune. Tiger Lu awakens angrily but goes into the courtyard Smiling and joins him with a gong. The two try harder to annoy and warm up to each other while the palace servants fall victim to the terrible racket.
There are other deleted scenes not worth mentioning. The dialogue in the original version was highly witty and also the lines between character's were more in depth. Still, although the dialogue wasn't up to par compared with the original, there is some credit due that they didn't make up really terrible dialogue in it's place. For the most part, the story moves along exactly as it does in the original and it's the story that is the real incredible part of this movie. The story contains romance, mistaken identity, traitors, heros, villains, tragedy, and (of course) victory. The storyline of this movie seems almost like one of Shakespeare's plays. Also, the original dialogue was even wittier than what Shakespeare would come up with- which makes me upset it was lost. My friends understood the story though, and loved the movie with it's flaws. As others have stated, it's inexcusable for a DVD release not have both languages and subtitles on it. That's whole point of getting a DVD, those great extra features. I'll wind up buying both versions, it's the kind of movie you want to share with people and some people just can't keep up with subtitles. I suggest you rent or buy the english version ""The Legend"", and if you like it- check out the subtitled version. You can find the subtitled version on eBay.",985737600,38,4383,4.541087231352718

936485,2,6304745281,"This senseless dubbing has got to stop.  Fans know this film as Fong Sai Yuk.  And this, like all Dimension releases, has ONE audio track: a bad English dub that makes every character in the whole movie sound like some fool straight out of a 70's ""chop sockey"" film.  What, praytell, is the point of the DVD format when there is no language option?  ESPECIALLY when they purge the original preferred subtitled format for a Saturday-morning version that perpetuates the whole badly-synced Asian stereotypes of the past.
Just take one look at how many Hong Kong DVDs are imported by Americans each year and TRY to tell me that Americans aren't ready for subtitled films.  Look at the success of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  AMERICANS ARE NOT THE CULTURALLY INEPT IGNORAMUSES THEY WERE IN THE 70'S!!!!
Though this dumb home video move should not really surprise anyone....  So PLEASE buy this film... via import, from Hong Kong, so you can see it how it was meant to be viewed and heard.",982886400,,987,4.7368421052631575
936505,4,6304745281,"This movie is a funny one. It feels like Drunken Master II in tone (and story). (Note: Drunken Master II is better tough.) Some of the fight scenes are original and impressive. The humor is present throughout almost all the movie.
But I wish I had seen the original version instead of that one. The voice acting is at times goofy and I'm not sure the dubbing reflects what was originally said. A Cantonnese version with English subtitles would have been welcomed. Alas it is not an option offered on Dimension DVDs (Twin Warriors, Twin Dragons, Fist of Legend,...).
In fact, there are never supplements on Hong Kong movies offered by that company. Not even the original theatrical trailers. At least, the picture and sound are quite good. But is it worth such a high price?

936506,3,6304745281,"I've seen both the subtitled Fong Sai Yuk and english dubbed The Legend on DVD.  The movie itself is fun and exciting with plenty of great action.  Being a Jet Li fan, I found the subtitled version much better than the dubbed only because the dubbed version left out or changed much of what was said and done in the subtitled version.  For example, in the subtitled version there was a funny reference to Jet's Once Upon a Time In China films, while in the dubbed version it was completely left out.  The only problem with the subtitled version was that the subtitles tended to dip into the bottom of the screen in the beginning of the movie.  If you can get a hold of the subtitled version, it's definitely worth watching.",979776000,6,723,4.446969696969697

936509,5,6304745281,"This is one of the most succesfull movie Jet Li has ever starred. It mingles comedy and action together, and it turned out brilliant. It's a  story about friendship and trust, Jet Li plays Fong Sai Yuk, a martial arts  kid who dosen't follow his dad's rules very well; Always fooling around  with his mother and his friends. The storyline and plot is very nicely  done, not the same old you-killed-my-father-and-I-want-to-get-revenge-type.  It's based on 19th century China. It involves a little bit around the  Manchus and The Red Flower Society which Jet Li's dad is secretly in.  In the opening scene, it shows the skills of the main villain(He's not  really a bad guy, he's the Govenor of Canton and he wants a list which Jet  Li's dad has). In a fight, he rips the skin off of one opponent's face(Not  as nasty as it sounds). Then he captures an incoming punch, twisted and  pushed it back so bad the guy's bone sticked out(Not as nasty as it sounds  either). After that part, it was pure comedy and action. There were a lot  of fights that lasted for quite a long time. My favorite was the fight on  top of the heads(you'll get what I'm talking when you watch it) and the one  against the govenor. Another part where this movie shined was that jet Li  didn't win any one-on-one fights. One of them he intentionally lost, the  other one he escaped, and the finale he kind of lost. Yet he still was the  hero in the end. This movie is definitely worth out checking(And don't  forget to check out Fong Sai Yuk 2, it's pretty damn good for a sequel that  was made 3 months after this one. I have seen sequels made 3 YEARS later  and they were excrable).",965779200,,1655,4.431893687707642

The thing that makes it so great is the clever screenplay and the combination of action, comedy, romance, drama, and historical content. Jet Li's amazing  wu-shu martial arts skills are truly worth seeing.  The only way for this  movie to be better for the American is if you know the Chinese Language,  and believe me, this movie is worth learning a language for. Fong Shi Yu,  (As Fong Sai Yuk is known to Mandarin Speakers), is definetly one of Jet  Li's best movies filmed during his prime.
