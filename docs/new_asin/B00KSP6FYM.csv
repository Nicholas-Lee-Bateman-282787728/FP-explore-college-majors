6445233,5,B00KSP6FYM,This was a very interesting and educational documentary about the early days of Satellite development. It also was a useful look back to the Cuban Missile crisis and how important weather satellites are to protecting the country.  I watched it a second time with my engineer wife as an example of what can go wrong with a project and people in the team as well as the history of her profession.,1426118400,,394,4.549295774647887
6445234,1,B00KSP6FYM,I want my $1.99 back.  That somebody has the nerve to charge for this rambling combination of esoteric data and tales of long ago is amazing.  There are minutiae but there is no meat on what could be an interesting topic.  Waste of time.,1424649600,,237,4.340909090909091

6445240,5,B00KSP6FYM,"The Satellite Men takes an interesting look at one segment of the cold war/space race period of US military history.  It was a time of heated competition between the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States (US), for nuclear supremacy.  Technological superiority was pursued as necessary for national security.  This documentary recounts top secret activities during this time of political and military tension.  Amazing men doing amazing things ....",1411948800,,451,5.492753623188406
6445241,5,B00KSP6FYM,An extremely interesting account of the early days of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program and the impact that it had on surveillance activities during the Cold War. The men involved relate their first hand experiences.....some very funny and some sobering.,1407715200,,265,5.65

8661200,5,B00KSP6FYM,"Very interesting! A wonderful look back in time by some very courageous men. Had they not been able and willing to do their job, our world might not be same! The real drama of the early 1960's ... The Cold War and developing technology might have changed the world, but these brilliant men saved it!",1474243200,,299,4.454545454545454

8661202,5,B00KSP6FYM,impressive documentary on some impressive work from the cold war days,1470700800,,69,5.363636363636363
8661203,5,B00KSP6FYM,Interesting history on the emerging space technology and the men responsible for developing it in the early years. Weather information  that is taken for granted today was critical during cold war standoffs.  Glad these pioneers got to share their story about the challeges and successes they experienced in getting this  weather satellite operational.,1469232000,,352,5.60377358490566
8661204,4,B00KSP6FYM,"For a short documentary it was adequate......probably I was expecting something more expansive, something with more details. When I think of it some of the topics was very secret......I am not certain what restrictions still apply to those who were interviewed.",1469232000,2,261,5.390243902439025
8661205,5,B00KSP6FYM,"Great story, remarkable interviews... as these men get older, I find watching their first-hand stories captured on film to be utterly amazing pieces of history.",1430870400,,160,5.44
8661206,2,B00KSP6FYM,"not worth the $1.99.  I expected something like a Nova documentary, but it isn't.  A compilation of recollections that may be of interest as a historical document, or verbal history; but without some commentary to tie it together, not really a documentary. The stuff's there. Someone should give some thought to it and make something interesting out of it.",1429574400,,356,5.016949152542373
