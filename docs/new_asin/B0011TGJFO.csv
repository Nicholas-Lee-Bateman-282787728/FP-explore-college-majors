3067831,3,B0011TGJFO,"Travis Walten's 1975 abduction by a UFO was the basis for the movie Fire in the Sky. In this documented lecture he tells the story firsthand of seeing a UFO, and being hit by a blast of energy that he likened to being tackled in football, and offers a detailed diagram of the ship where he was held. This DVD is one in a series of lectures filmed at the 2003 International Scientific and Metaphysical Symposium in Brisbane, Australia.",1350777600,,434,4.506329113924051
3067832,3,B0011TGJFO,"I actually thought this would be like a movie, only more along the truth.  It was not.  It was a lecture with very limited pictures available to see, unless you were actually at the lecture, due to copyright issues.  Very unfair for the viewer.  It was interesting to hear Travis speak of his abduction and how it differs from the Hollywood version.  All in all, the video was a disappointment to me.",1295395200,,400,4.5
3067833,1,B0011TGJFO,"This documentary is a single camera recording of a lecture with split-screen amateur graphics when copyrights allowed.  Not even worth the price of renting, certainly not worth buying.",1208563200,2,184,5.571428571428571
3067834,5,B0011TGJFO,"Travis Walton's experience has been explored in the film ""Fire in the Sky"" (1993), but there is nothing like getting it straight from the source.  Walton discusses the evening he was abducted by an alien spacecraft in the presence of three of his coworkers.  In a spine-tingling revelation, after being zapped by a bolt of brilliant light hovering over the ground in Northern Arizona, he awakens aboard the craft in dire pain, surrounded by alien beings.  Detailed artist renderings depict his descriptions of the beings, the ship, and journey as he searches for an escape.  Walton appeared back on ""a familiar road"" after disappearing for 5 days and 6 hours.  The four days after he went missing, law enforcement conducted an intensive search without turning up anything.  Walton's coworkers underwent scrutiny and passed lie detector tests about the event they witnessed. After returning, a traumatized Walton was given numerous psychological tests with no abnormalities detected.  This is a fascinating story from a person, who by all scientific determinants is credible.  The 1993 movie does not depict everything accurately, so anyone who wants to know what really happened to Travis Walton will want to see this DVD.",1205366400,14,1222,5.198979591836735
3067835,5,B0011TGJFO,"As a teenager, I saw Fire in the Sky and was captivated by it.  I could not stop thinking about Travis Walton and wondering if he really was abducted.  This dvd went so far beyond the movie in making me believe in what he experienced.  There is nothing better than hearing it from the source!  Highly recommend.",1204243200,11,311,4.4035087719298245
