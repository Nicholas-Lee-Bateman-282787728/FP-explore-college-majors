4154343,3,B003M4II5U,"This isn't really good for people who don't have a background in qigong.  Qigong involves coordinating body movements, breath and attention - and the instructions on this video just cover body movements.  If you have a background in qigong you can probably figure it out - and you'll probably be familiar with many of these exercises from their original sources such as baduanjin.  If you don't have a background in qigong this won't teach it to you.",1271462400,5,450,4.818181818181818

8400075,2,B003M4II5U,"Disappointed as it was 2 chapters of yoga moves I already know and only 1 chapter of Qi Gong poses which are covered in most of Lee's other videos. I was hoping to learn more low back specific Qi Gong poses. Most of the yoga poses covered are common poses known for low back and core strength. Setting was gorgeous, music peaceful and Lee is a great teacher but just not worth the $.",1485043200,5,383,4.1891891891891895

8400078,5,B003M4II5U,"Wonderful and very helpful  for my back pain, although  one needs to do the exercises carefully/ gently  if one has a true spinal injury.
 ALso suffers from  a poor video quality, being  copied  and recopied from an old video- too bad.",1410825600,3,235,4.585365853658536

8400080,3,B003M4II5U,"I love Lee Holden's videos, but this one is a bit hard for beginners. Also,  I am quite overweight and have bad knees and  some of these exercises are impossible.  I could only do about a quarter of the exercises, but they helped. As in yoga, the trick is to only do what you can do and stop if you feel any discomfort. I was disappointed I could perform more of the exercises, however.",1401667200,4,386,4.1891891891891895
8400081,5,B003M4II5U,"My daughter said it was her best Christmas present, because the excerises are helping her back.  I recommend this DVD if someone has low back pain.",1390262400,3,147,4.653846153846154
8400082,5,B003M4II5U,"Qi Gong for Low Back Pain is an absolute lifesaver for me! When my back pain is really bad, I can barely crawl to the DVD player to shove the disc in. But after going through these routines, I'm a whole new person, able to get myself to work and be a productive human being again instead of a miserable lump on the couch. It's night and day for me, the pain relief is so significant.

I went to my doctor for my back this week and besides prescribing a muscle relaxer, he outlined several exercises for me to do. Nearly every exercise he described is clearly demonstrated on this DVD. I suggested he mention this DVD to his patients experiencing lower back pain.

The routines are easy to perform, not strenuous at all.  Lee Holden does a great job of guiding you through them. The video was shot at a beautiful river location and the background music is very soothing. The entire experience is calming, nurturing, and surprisingly enjoyable. In response to the reviewer who felt like this was not a good instructional video for Qi Gong, hey, I'm not trying to learn Qi Gong, I'm trying to relieve my severe back pain, and this DVD does exactly that.

When experiencing a bad bout of back pain, instead of popping pain killers I'll pop this video in two or three times a day. I also alternate heat and cold on my back with a microwave-heated bean bag and a frozen gel pack. I do one for 20 minutes at the top of the hour, then alternate with the other at the next top of the hour. Takes a few days to get back to normal, but it's a steady progression back to a pain-free existence. This DVD is a critical component of my recovery. (Thank you Lee Holden, wherever you are!)

I might also suggest you buy directly from the Exercise to Heal website, as it's less than half the current Amazon price of $50. Other Qi Gong DVDs are available there too. I've tried Qi Gong for Healthy Joints & Bones and it leaves me relaxed yet energized. It's hard to find the time to do it, but when I do, I feel great afterward.

Here's to your health and a pain-free back!",1376524800,5,2053,4.3194805194805195
8400083,5,B003M4II5U,"I suffer from chronic back pain and sciatica, and Lee Holden's Qi Gong for Low Back Pain really helps.  The sitting and kneeling sections are gentle but effective. He incorporates many traditional yoga poses, stretches, and core strengthening which help my back feel much better. There is also a partner massage section that I am looking forward to trying.  I highly recommend all Lee Holden's DVDs: he is the best!",1329350400,4,415,4.914285714285715
