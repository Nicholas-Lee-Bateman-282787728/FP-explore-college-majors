The Goodnight character is well developed and one can understand why he interprets the law and dispenses justice as he does.  There is drama, humor, action and of course justice the Goodnight way.  I really enjoyed watching this movie and have seen it at least seven times now and can hardly wait for another sequel to this western saga.",1397347200,2,433,4.657894736842105
