8206636,5,B000SSNKVA,"This is probably the best of the Hot Shots & Cool Clips series. The footage of Elvis is simply beautiful! There is NO JAT logo printed across Elvis' face. I don't know what the other reviewer is talking about. There's a nice variety of film from various times in Elvis' life. I found it very enjoyable, even if there's no singing in it.",1479859200,,336,4.349206349206349
8206637,2,B000SSNKVA,"Previous reviewer ReelFan states that the JAT logo appears over Elvis's face during the Astrodome press conference. 2nd reviewer D Restly says flatly that this is not true. So I bought the DVD, based 95% on the ""complete"" Astrodome press conference - sure enough, the JAT logo (quite annoyingly) DOES appear DIRECTLY on Elvis's face during a significant portion of the press conference - in particular, throughout EVERY portion where the camera is in close up on Elvis' face. So, to firmly settle the competing assertions between the two prior reviewers, ReelFan is absolutely correct and D Restly is dead wrong. Also interesting is that the offending logo has D Restly's name on it (!) right after JAT! So no one should know better that this complaint is in fact TRUE, than the person claiming here that it is not. As a former producer and editor of corporate videos, I found the logo's placement particularly offensive in that it was overlayed directly over the sole subject of the video (ELVIS) during an extended portion, and during the close-ups, when it was directly over Elvis's face and therefore obvious even to a lay person that it should not have been in use during those brief segments, it remained there - even though it was highly obtrusive and quite annoying. When one additionally factors in that the DVD is quite over-priced against comparable videos, and that a substantial portion of its content appears on other DVD's costing less than half of what this one does, an egregious defect such as the abusive use of the logo becomes all the more inexcusable. Anyone associated with the production or quality assurance of this video should have realized how adversely the logo's use affected the Houston interview. To have not removed it during the close ups when it was directly over Elvis' face, was just inexcusable and really aggravating.",1219536000,2,1856,4.914012738853503
