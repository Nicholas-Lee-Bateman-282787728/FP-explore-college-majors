5510565,5,B00AVWLX2G,I have almost all of Cathe's workout Dvd's and I have to say this series is my favorite! I have been looking for something new but didn't want to stray to far away from a good old fashion Cathe style workout. I have been feeling like I was in a rut and not looking forward to working out anymore. This series brought me back. If I ever have the chance to meet Cathe I would be so thankful. I feel like she's a long lost friend since I've started almost every morning with one of her Dvd's. Thanks Cathe for the continued motivation and fun workouts. You are truly the best at what you do!,1361404800,2,588,4.121739130434783
5510566,5,B00AVWLX2G,"I confess to having an addiction to acquiring workout DVDs I may or may not ever use! I bought this set used, but I'm not sure it had been. It came in perfect condition accompanied by a hand book. Like any self-respecting workout DVD addict, over a few days I sat down and watched each of the nine discs.

This program has nine complete workouts that can be used as part of Cathe's Xtrain program or as stand alone workouts. Each disc has several options that pop up in the main menu. All you have to do is choose your option and press play. The workout is seamlessly played. The sound quality is superb, the camera work very effective and thorough. Cathe's cuing is dead on, and she and her crew of workout partners show consistent good form. And they are really doing the work!

You will need equipment for this program.  A stability exercise ball is an absolute must. (A note here: make sure you get the right size for your height.) Resistance bands, the kind with handles, in a couple different resistances are needed. Cathe uses a step bench with five risers per side. I only have four for mine and I am quite tall, so I may need to get a couple more. I use The Step and am pleased with it. Cathe also uses something she calls Firewalker bands which are closed elastic loops used around the calves or thighs for additional resistance in some exercises. She uses gliding discs under her feet in some work as well. I was unable to find the exact discs she uses but found that the large discs used for furniture moving work well. A pair of boxing gloves are recommended for the boxing workout. They aren't necessary, but, boy do they add to the effectiveness! The same disc has a workout with a heavy punching bag which I do not have, but it sure looks like fun. The mainstay equipment needed for this program are dumbbells. Lots of dumbbells. It seems unlikely that most of us have a tower of dumbbells in different weights in the corner of our livingroom. I use adjustable dumbbells by BowFlex. When choosing adjustable dumbbells for this program, it is important to get a set that can be very quickly adjusted and has a wide range of weights, because you will lift heavy on this program. For lighter weights, the BowFlex seem awkward to me, so I have separate sets in 5, 8, and 10 pounds. You can see that to have all the equipment for this program will set you back more than $600.00, but the truth is, most of us who have been working out at home have been acquiring these things for some time. And storage space requirement of all this equipment is actually quite minimal.

But the workouts....get to the workouts already! These discs are listed as being for the ""advanced"" level of fitness geek. I doubt that I am really advanced, but certainly this is not the program to start if this is your first foray into exercising. It is hard. Every single disc is hard. You will be sweating. You will get sore. You will get tired. But if you stick with it, you will get very strong. And your cardio endurance will skyrocket. And you will have fun. Because fun is a key component of this program. Cathe switches things up all the time. It is not boring in the least. Take, for example, the workout for biceps and triceps. Round after round of exercises just for your arms that switch from bicep to tricep and back again, each exercise just a little different from the last. Your arms are toasted. And then the next day you'll do one of the cardio workouts. You'll sweat and gasp and maybe reach for the remote pause button a few times. But there is a kind of beaming that comes from working that hard. If you choose to follow Cathe's 90 day program which is outlined in the handbook, you will work six days a week. Each day is 35-80 minutes of work. She has taken the guesswork out of what to do when, how much to do, what order exercises are done. It's a complete program.

So as a workout DVD acquisition addict, I am more than pleased with this set. While I do not follow the program exactly (I am also addicted to non-traditional forms of working out using kettlebells, sandbags, and battling ropes), I have found these DVDs easy to merge into my existing workouts. A good purchase for sure!",1360972800,50,4195,4.421733505821475
5510567,5,B00AVWLX2G,"I'm only a few days into a month-long XTrain rotation, so I will be sure to update my review as I use this series more and as I (hopefully!) continue to see results!  In the meantime, though, I wanted to post a review to say how much I've been enjoying this set! I'm a huge Cathe fan (she's my all-time favorite DVD instructor), but I felt like her last few series weren't as much fun, and I find myself only using a few workouts from the Low Impact Series in a regular basis.  With this new set, Cathe has brought back more of the ""fun factor,"" and I've been enjoying this a lot so far!

The 9-DVD set comes with the following workouts:

--Disc 1/Chest, Back & Shoulders -- has a rep range of about 16 reps
--Disc 2/Bi's & Tri's [sic] -- has a rep range of about 16 reps
--Disc 3/Burn Sets -- three sets of 10 reps
--Disc 4/Super Cuts -- a low-impact metabolic circuit workout with compound and functional moves
--Disc 5/Legs -- contains standing leg work, stability ball work, barre work,and floor work
--Disc 6/Cardio Leg Blast -- has weighted exercises, followed by plyo blasts
--Disc 7/All-Out Low Impact HIIT -- includes three rounds of HIIT exercises
--Disc 8/Hard Strikes -- boxing workout, with a heavy bag bonus segment
--Disc 9/Tabatacise -- has five separate workouts that you can string together as your endurance increases

The tenth disk that comes optionally is Ride, a spinning workout.

To do the workouts, you'll need a step, dumbbells, a stability ball, a resistance band with handles, a Firewalker band, Gliding Disks, and (optional) boxing gloves.

Each one is just under an hour, which makes them a lot more convenient to use than STS was.  It also comes with a User Guide, which lists four different rotations you can use with this set, as well as detailed information about each workout.  The four rotations that are included in the User Guide are:

--90-Day Undulating Workout Program
--90-Day Xtrain + Low Impact Series Workout Program
--30-Day Cardio + Strength Combined Workout Program
--30-Day Undulating + Ride Workout Program

If you go to Cathe's website, you can also register for an account and use their Workout Manager to download the workouts and print workout cards that tell you what weights to use (after you do the One Rep Max tests).

The set includes about 142 premixes, as well as several bonus workouts.  Amongst those bonus workouts are two core/ab workouts, and five 100-rep challenges, where you try to work to failure by doing 100 reps of some exercises.

The music is good, and, while Cathe is still a bit more serious in these than she used to be in her older workouts, they're still a lot of fun.

As I mentioned, I'll be sure to update this as I continue with the series.",1360540800,6,2725,4.624481327800829
5510568,5,B00AVWLX2G,"I have now completed each workout at least 1x. There is endless variety with this series. Each disc has dozens of premixes, a few bonuses, and a 100 rep challenge. The upper body workouts complement each other perfectly. Discs 1 and 2 do not repeat any sets and work the muscle groups in rounds. The premixes allow you to add core, break the workout in half or do extreme versions etc... the 3rd disc has 2 workouts on it. the upper body work goes by one muscle group at a time and you do 3 sets of each exercise and completely fail one group before moving on to the next.
disc 4 is supercuts and is a total body low impact circuit workout that is full of new moves and variety. disc 5 is legs. She uses light weights for the standing portion but oh my,.... do not let that fool you. the sections are standing, barre, ball/chair, and floorwork. There is a bonus rear delt workout on this disc.
Disc 6 is another leg workout. It alternates between plyo and wt work. Cathe does use heavy wt but she doesn't go overboard on reps. I mainly felt this workout in my hamstrings the next day. It was fun and nothing was repeated, which is kinda the theme of this series.
The rest of the discs are cardio workouts. I love Hardstrikes the most. The music just rocks and I love the premix that includes the heavy bag tabata bonus. the other 2 cardio workouts are HiiT and Tabata. Great thorough and challenging cardio work in this series. I don't have the Ride disc. So can't share on that one.
I have been using this series exclusively this month and love the variety and the fun. Who knew working so hard could be fun? Cathe is a 5 star instructor and truly knows how to lead you to results.",1358985600,24,1682,4.275862068965517
5510569,5,B00AVWLX2G,"I used to workout at home all the time, but have been going to the gym for about 4 years now. When my schedule changed and I needed to workout at home some days, I decided to see what was new from Cathe since she was always my favorite in the past. Wow! I have been having so much fun workout out at home with the XTrain series. I've had the set for a few months now, and I haven't even begun to get bored yet (doing the videos on average twice a week).To be honest though, I haven't even done all the videos yet because they are so challenging  I haven't fully  mastered the ones I have tried. I definitely have to say that Super Cuts is my favorite home workout of all time. It is so challenging and has so much variety. I am really ADD when I exercise, so I like to change what I'm doing every couple of minutes or I get bored quickly. Super Cuts is basically just a whole bunch of intervals, but more than just jumping and such. I also love All Out Low Impact HIIT, Cardio Leg Blast, Tabatacise, and Legs. One thing that has changed since in the past few years is that we now have surround sound on our TV which makes it really close to the gym experience when I work out at home. If you are a home exerciser, get this. You won't regret it. And I guess if you do, you can just resell it on Amazon!",1423699200,,1301,4.0
5510570,5,B00AVWLX2G,"I love ,love this workout. I was so sore after each workout. Which is A good thing. Awesome workout!!!!!!",1420934400,,105,4.578947368421052
5510571,4,B00AVWLX2G,We have only tried the Tabata workout.  It is a tough workout for my wife and I.  The premixes with the core work out are great.  Looking forward to using the rest of the DVD's.,1420416000,,177,4.0
5510572,5,B00AVWLX2G,This is amazing and I love her style of teaching and it's a tough workout,1419120000,,73,3.933333333333333
5510573,5,B00AVWLX2G,This series really helped slim me down.  There are so many options to do that it is wonderful.  Cathe is so impressive.  She really is the best I believe.  This is a must have out of her DVDs.,1418083200,,192,3.973684210526316
5510574,4,B00AVWLX2G,"There is A LOT of content with this set. It really does have a little of everything. Great workouts. I love that it has so many premixes and bonuses with each disc that truly allow you to customize your work out. But keep in mind, there's a lot of equipment needed. If you don't already have dumbbells, a step, etc, you'll really need to purchase them and that could get quite expensive.

My only main criticism is that if you truly want to follow the program in the guide, you have to devote a lot of time to working out. Each day calls for nearly an hour to an hour and a half. I have found that you can break it up and do it two sessions, which helps some, but still requires time. But, there are always the premix-timesaver options that allow for flexibility.

I also wish there was an option for a running time/clock with each work-out, but I suppose that would be impossible with the premix options.",1417478400,,905,4.317647058823529
5510575,5,B00AVWLX2G,"I really wanted to purchase a fitness program like Insanity or P90X but was reluctant b/c of the price and my unfamiliarity with the instructors. I'm a long time Cathe fan and have been doing her workouts for years, so I thought she might be my best bet. Just to give you some background to help you see my gauge, I'm an advanced exerciser and a former fitness instructor (and for comparison, I've done Supreme 90 Day with Tom Holland), so I was definitely looking for something super challenging. Here's what you get in the 9 dvd bundle:

1. Chest, Back & Shoulders
2. Bi's & Tri's
3. Burn Sets (which includes 2 workouts -- one Bi's & Tri's, one for Chest, Back, Shoulders)
4. Super Cuts
5. Legs
6. Cardio Leg Blast (cardio + legs)
7. All Out Low Impact HIIT (cardio)
8. Hard Strikes (cardio)
9. Tabatacise (cardio)
+multiple 100 rep challenges
+ 2 ten minute ab workouts

PROs:
-It's a great balance of cardio and strength training -- 3 cardio workouts, 6 strength, and 1 hybrid all done on rotation
-the bonus barre workout in Legs...though it's not so much of a bonus if you follow the 90 day program, since the premix Cathe assigns always includes the one the barre workout!
-Cathe gives great cues re: form, challenging yourself, selecting the right weights
-While I do like her other workouts that cue on the beat, I appreciate that she stepped away from that with a lot of her workouts because some exercises just require that you go at your own pace.
-the user guide -- it's super thorough in explaining the program design, and also offers a few different rotations - both 90 and 30 days that you can work with.
-100 rep challenges! At first, I only squeezed in these little 5 minute bonuses maybe once a week or something, but as I progressed with the program I kind of got addicted to them and did them every other workout. Basically, these are bonus segments where she takes one exercise and has you go light weight and do 100 reps (w/ a few breaks between reps!) and I feel like they really made a difference! She included a few -- bicep curls, scarecrows, lat raises, tricep extensions and glute bridges.
-I was looking for a challenging workout program, and I found it here! The only other workout program/dvd set I've done that I can compare it to is Supreme 90 Day with Tom Holland, which I also liked, though I'd say that Cathe's program is more challenging and better made.
-I really liked that she included a low impact cardio dvd, as it provided a much needed break from all of the other high impact cardio. Didn't sacrifice intensity though!
-premixes galore!

CONs:
-I'm not crazy about Hard Strikes, but I'm not crazy about kickboxing in general. The other thing about it that I didn't like was that it's heavy on jumping jacks, and my body never got quite used to that.
-I know I said that there was a good balance between cardio and weights, and I DO think that, but I suppose it was b/c I did the full 90 day program that in the last couple of weeks I started to get a bit bored with the cardio and wished I had 1-2 more cardio workouts to bring into the rotation. In a 30 or 60 day program, I think the variety of cardio is more than sufficient.

I just completed my 90 day program and have to say that it made quite a difference. I have lost some weight that I had been trying to shed, though I think that's mostly owed to eating better. I definitely feel stronger though and have more definition, particularly in my upper body. Bottom line: I'd recommend it!",1415491200,3,3489,4.421461897356143
5510576,5,B00AVWLX2G,Love it,1414281600,,7,3.0
5510577,4,B00AVWLX2G,I REALLY LIKE HER WORKOUTS AND THERE ARE SO MANY VARIATIONS,1413158400,,59,4.454545454545454
5510578,5,B00AVWLX2G,"Excellent workouts.  It's important to take the time to do your one rep max.  This was a great program.  I am now doing sts and plan in doing this again.  As with all of Cathe's workouts they are long, but they show results.",1407801600,,224,4.1395348837209305
5510579,5,B00AVWLX2G,"I have complete programs such as Insanity, Focus T25 and P90X3 ...this is right up there with them and the variety of moves and equipment used is tough challenging and awesome!",1400198400,,176,4.709677419354839
5510580,3,B00AVWLX2G,"Having tried several 90 day workout programs, I find the X-Train series to be simply okay. The program's strength is that it is fun, the moves are dynamic ,and time is not wasted with banter. I do not like, however, that there is no stretching at the beginning of each exercise, and there is no timer on the screen letting viewers know how long each exercise is and how many more minutes remain in the video. Please know that the upper body workout videos require heavy weights. Cathe uses 30 lbs weights in the chest, back and shoulders video. As someone with an injury, I don't feel comfortable lifting heavy weights and prefer to do low weight and high rep exercises. It would be also helpful if the performers in the video showed modifications of each exercise rather than all doing the same thing. Overall, the program is okay but there are better programs for less money.",1397088000,4,877,4.592356687898089
5510581,5,B00AVWLX2G,"I was debating whether or not to purchase the entire XTrain 9 DVD bundle, wondering if I reeeeally needed all of these different DVDs. Well, it was one of the best purchases I've made! I absolutely love the variety within each DVD (great premixes, bonuses, and challenges) and across the entire set. I love the variety they add to my workouts throughout the week. Cathe is my favorite instructor for a reason - she pushes you hard, has top notch technique, and has a great personality without being irritating like some other instructors.",1396137600,5,538,4.795698924731183
5510582,5,B00AVWLX2G,Great workout! I am in my 60's and do my modifications and can keep up but of course I have workout out for over 35 years!,1395705600,,122,3.730769230769231
5510583,5,B00AVWLX2G,"The specifics of the workout have already been explained so I will review the results and explain what I did if and when I did modifications as of week 2 of the 90 day program. I purchased the program to take my workouts to the next level. I started with Jillian Michaels in October 2013 and I have been rotating most of her DVDs; losing 20 pounds!! I purchased a few of Cathe's workouts and loved everyone (Crissfire, Butts and Guts, etc) so I decided to commit to her 90 day program. Today starts week 3 and I have lost 6 pounds in 2 weeks and although I haven't done my measurements, my clothes are noticeablly loser.( I will later update on inches lost)
I ate well 5-6 days per week, I had some things I should not have had but I worked a little harder and got back on track.
I have done the workouts in order everyday, when I needed to break for a few seconds, I did. I used the same or a few pounds lighter weights as Cathe used. I sometimes stopped some of the moves a few lunges or squats earlier than they did. I completed most of the scheduled core workouts and I have not done any of the 100 rep challenges. All in all, I still felt like I got a good combo of cardio and strength training. I sweated, my body was wonderfully sore, more so on week 1, and I felt great! I would definitely recommend this to intermediate to advanced  exercisers. You will feel great, you will sweat, you will have fun and never be bored, and if you stick to it and eat well, you will see awesome results in no time. Good Luck!!

UPDATE
Today, I am in week 5 and I am continuing to see great results. I have a NEW FAVORITE TRAINER... I love her calm motivation and the fact that she's doing it with me. My body is toning. My legs have been screaming but I focus on the results and tune out my minor discomfort. My butt is lifting so nicely, my arms are smaller and toning well, my hamstrings are lovely. I can go on and on!! Cathe thoroughly works your whole body and she does so in a well thought of routine. People are asking me everyday what I am doing! This program definitely delivers and I know my results will be even greater at the end of my 90 days. Commit to it so it can work for you!",1394496000,12,2185,4.102803738317757
5510584,5,B00AVWLX2G,"This DVD bundle set is SO fantastic! I would pay double for this and it would be worth every penny! If you are unfamiliar with Cathe's workouts she always has time saver routines along with premixes, so with the 9 DVD's you have over 100 exercises.....Her workouts are challenging and they produce results. You can always do a modified version if the intensity is too high. For maximum benefit, I do recommend getting a step with at least 2 to 3 risers per side along with a stability ball and some weights. I am in week 2 of a 30-day program and plan to start a 90-day program the end of this month. Also, you will have access to Cathe's website where all of her workouts are on the site and you can print workout cards to track your progress along with your calories, weight loss, etc. You can also add workouts to your profile that are not from Cathe, in case you do other exercises instead of hers. I simply cannot say enough great things about this program and the website! :-)",1388534400,4,982,4.371584699453552
5510585,5,B00AVWLX2G,I got this and it comes with a book.  I started one of four programs she has. I had never owned one of Cathe's dvds but decided to buy this bundle cause I wanted something different. I am 45 and in great shape and she is AWESOME. variety and a challenge. LOVE IT!!,1387756800,2,264,3.981132075471698
5510586,5,B00AVWLX2G,"I love this!! Totally changing my body, I have not really been watching what I eat but am still seeing differences in my body!! Will start over after holidays with better diet and see what changes come!!!  Cathe is AWESOME!! I never knew what I was missing!!!",1385337600,2,259,4.51063829787234
5510587,5,B00AVWLX2G,this group of workouts has enough variety to suit everyone and just about everyones time issues.  I tried the 9 week schedule and really enjoyed the variety.  I did not really enjoy the kickboxing disc items she selected on her 90 day program -  I will change this out for a different routine.  I really enjoyed the mixture of heavier weight challenges.  The variety in this set really cannot be beat.  I look forward to continuing this and changing out a few items for more favorite work outs,1384646400,,493,4.545454545454546
5510588,4,B00AVWLX2G,I enjoyed these workouts.  I am not usually a fan of split workouts but i did like this set of workouts.  Cathe is fun and motivating.  The workouts I would say are intermediate level.  Cathe seams to make more intense workouts when she releases two DVD's at a time instead of nine.  So if you are looking for a more advance workout from Cathe get Cross Fire and To the Max.  I like the fact that this set comes in a plastic DVD case instead of those cardboard cases DVD's sets usually come in.  Non of my DVD's were scratched.,1383955200,4,527,4.21
5510589,5,B00AVWLX2G,"Cathe did it again :)  First of all,I love Cathe's training style:  serious about fitness, excellent demo and cuing, positive and easy to listen to.  X Train is a great addition to my workout collection.  I do not like to waste time working out, and I don't like doing the same routines over and over again.  This is a great combination of DVD's.  First of all, each of the 9 DVD's are different styles of training- heavy weights, Tabata drills, lighter weights with cardio training, upper body, lower body...etc.. ALSO each DVD has many options for adding on to your workout.  (they are called ""Premixes""- where in addition to the main workout there are options to add on- like a 10 minute core workout,or a 6 minute burn set for one muscle group.)  You can even do ""Timesaver"" workouts if you are short on time.  There are so many options!
Cathe is an old favorite of mine from the Fitness Channel (back when there were REAL workouts and not just yoga.)  Lately I have been training with Beachbody workouts like Insanity, Asylum, Turbo Fire...and a knock off of P90X (I couldn't stand the P90X trainer...so I found a GREAT $20 series called ""Supreme 90 Day"" which I like much better) But in my eyes, XTrain is a good combo of a P90X weight style and a serious-but- lower-impact cardio training.  (the cardio that Xtrain includes is not going to push you as hard as Insanity, but it's still good.  Cathe does a good job of getting your heart rate up, but then giving you time to pull yourself together before ramping it up again.  She makes you use your muscles rather than lots of jumping to get your heart rate going.)

I'll wrap this up, but I was looking for  a workout with lower impact (trying to get over a knee injury), challenging weights, diversity for my easy boredum, and serious intensity.  XTrain did all of these things.  Love it- Thank you, Cathe!",1380931200,4,1864,4.54954954954955
5510590,5,B00AVWLX2G,"I like the variety of exercises. I have done P90X and after an injury to my elbow (a 8 month period) I needed a change from P90X, and Cathe's XTrain sounded like the perfect thing and I am not dissapointed.  I also like that Cathe takes her time to explain the exercises, everything is well detailed.  Thank you.",1379289600,3,312,4.362068965517241

5510592,5,B00AVWLX2G,I have been doing a modified version of P90x for a year on and off but had the DVDs that I use from the program memorized and was getting bored and lost the motivation to do the same thing yet once again.  I have used two of the DVDs in the XTrain program so far and really like them.  No repetition which is nice.  Fast moving.  Challenging.  Very glad I made this purchase.,1375660800,2,375,4.082191780821918
5510593,2,B00AVWLX2G,"My only challenge with this routine is there is no stretch routine. Sure there is warm up and cool down with every disc but that is not sufficient to avoid injury. I have done several rounds of other routines and P90X (which has great stretching and yoga) and was in excellent condition without any painful flare ups before starting this routine. 1/2 way though the program I needed to stop and begin physical therapy (with 2 costly MRI's) due to pain inflammation in lower back and neck. It was a flare up from a car accident I had several years ago.

I quickly learned stretching is essential to avoid injury and pain caused by growing muscles. As your muscles grow over time they shorten causing pain and misalignment throughout your body. If this routine would have had a stretch routine I probably could have avoided the flare up and medical costs. If you choose this routine, I would highly recommend you add a stretch day by purchasing an additional stretching video especially, if you have had previous injures. Your body will thank you. This is great if you are disciplined to take on the challenge and want to change your shape.",1373846400,9,1138,4.661691542288557
5510594,5,B00AVWLX2G,"I'm loving this XTrain series!  I'm already seeing results after 3 weeks.  Many of the workouts are low impact (yet still very intense), so that's a huge bonus.  I don't dread these workouts. Cathe is simply the best!",1370390400,4,217,4.657894736842105
5510595,5,B00AVWLX2G,"The Xtrain series has it all:  intense weight training, intense cardio and metabolic training.  It is based on the concept of periodization, which means you change the focus and goal of your training program at different intervals.  With all of this variety, you will not get bored with this set!

I was not excited when Cathe first described this set as a follow-up to Cross Train Express.  I didn't like that series.  I don't think this set is anything like that set.  This is a wonderful mix of STS, Cross Fire and Low Impact Series.

Why I love, love, love this series:

* The weight workouts are intense!  I love heavy weight training and this has become my new favorite.  I took the time to do my 1 rep max tests and it really made a difference in how I pushed myself.  It wasn't too hard to do.  About a week before I started Xtrain, I took one day to do the chest, back and shoulders tests.  A few days later, I did the biceps and triceps tests.  You don't have to do 1 rep max for legs.

* The cardio is intense.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  I had just come off of a 60 day Insanity rotation and thought the cardio would be too easy.  Not so.  I love low impact HIIT; talk about the best of both worlds, intense cardio that is easy on the joints!

* The metabolic training has me on energy high for the entire day.  I feel worked out, but not totally exhausted so that I'm not doing much for the rest of the day.  As I sit at my desk for the rest of the day, I have the energy to get up and move about every hour or so.

* There are no excuses.  Each DVD has several premixes, both longer and shorter than the original workouts.  Even if you only have 20 minutes, you can get a good workout.

I'm still not sure how I will incorporate the 100 rep challenges into my routine.  Currently, I'm doing the 90 Day Undulating Rotation.  Since I just started, my muscles are pretty fatigued at the end of the workout and I couldn't imagine adding on even a 10 rep challenge, never mind a 100 rep one.

Here's the breakdown of the workouts:

Weight Training:

Disc 1: Chest, Back & Shoulders - 51:16
Disc 2: Bi's & Tri's - 45:34
Disc 3: Burn Set Chest, Back & Shoulders - 50:43 and Burn Set Bi's & Tri's - 37:15
Disc 5: Legs - 51:42

Intense Cardio

Disc 7: All out Low Impact HIIT - 38:53
Disc 8: Hard Strikes Boxing - 46:37
Disc 9: Tabatacise - 44:42

Metabolic Training:

Disc 4: Super Cuts - 45:55
Disc 6: Cardio Leg Blast - 56:18

If you want a series that has it all and that will challenge you and keep you motivated, then the Xtrain series is for you!",1365206400,26,2565,4.129817444219067
5510596,5,B00AVWLX2G,"This is by far the best of those long term workout programs and least likely to result in boredom. As always, Cathe has clear instructions and emphasizes proper form. The exercises are relatively basic, and for strength you do X reps with properly selected weight (though in Burn sets in your last set you go to failure), which I find more useful than P90X or P90X2 since weight selections are explained better. I like the fact that in burn sets in failure set she doesn't count last rep if it wasn't in perfect form. Concerning equipment, heavy dumbbells are needed and so is the step and stability ball, while the tubing and firewalker band can be replaced with resistance bands if you already have them (with suitably selected resistance, I find medium resistance tubing to be closer to heavy resistance resistance band rather than medium). Sliders and dixie cups I don't count under equipment, simple paper plates and cups will do. I also like the fact that warm ups and cool downs are not the same, which is something that I strongly dislike on many long term exercise programs (because warm ups and cool downs if the same or extremely similar are the things you get bored first when doing certain program for a while).

Overall, this is a good program especially for those aiming to get stronger with basic exercises. After this, one might progress to Rushfit or P90X2 which have emphasis on different aspects of fitness (for example, in P90X2 core workout you have one legged burpee with diamond pushup using stability ball - unless you are already strong both in terms of core strength and upper body strength, you have no chance of doing reasonable number of reps).",1365033600,4,1674,4.752577319587629
5510597,5,B00AVWLX2G,I would suggest this to anyone who wants to jump start their routine! I love the variety.  It keeps me motivated.,1364256000,,113,4.380952380952381
5510598,5,B00AVWLX2G,"I love this program.  It provides a lot of variety to get in great shape.  I'm 45 and workout 6 days a week so I get rather bored trying to choose what I'm going to work out to everyday.  This program gives you so many options and premixes you will never get bored.  It also challenges every muscle group.  I highly recommend, it's well worth your time and money.",1363478400,3,363,4.202898550724638
8558095,3,B00AVWLX2G,"At least one of the DVD's freezes part-way through; I have to advance to the next chapter to continue.  If other disks have the same problem, this will be going back.  Otherwise, it's as advertised.",1521158400,,198,4.628571428571429
8558096,5,B00AVWLX2G,"Wow! Where do I begin! What a phenomenal program!! I have a lot of beachbody programs and a ton of other multi-DVD/workout programs but this surpasses them all. Cathe's cueing is dead on, her crew executes the moves with precision and truly appear to enjoy themselves and everyone is working hard. They are all REAL people. The cardio is fun and varied, the focused weight training is superb, the extra bonus are just icing on the cake! I can't recommend this program enough. I really like programs that incorporate various fitness equipment tools like Cathe's does. After this program I feel stronger and more comfortable in my skin! Thanks Cathe and Crew! Nice work!!",1494720000,3,669,4.87719298245614

The routines are tough in a good way and if at anytime you think it gets too easy ( not yet for me ) just add more weight. Hard strikes is one of my favorites for a quick and fun cardio, love it!",1474070400,,325,3.7941176470588234
8558098,5,B00AVWLX2G,Love Cathe and her workouts.  She makes a tough workout fun.  You will feel it and you will see it if you keep pushing play.  This program provides a lot of variety.,1441152000,,165,4.09375
8558099,4,B00AVWLX2G,"I'm loving the workouts, challenging but fun.  Great variety and customizable lengths to suit my schedule l,  Disappointed it did not come with work out guide as I expected and had to order it separately from cathe.com so I knew what order to do them in",1438819200,,253,4.478260869565218
8558100,5,B00AVWLX2G,"The way she has designed this gives you oodles and oodles of options! There are premixes that you can select to save time, mix in other work, add more work, add some core.... on and on. I'm getting stronger and I'm also watching what I eat, so I'm loving how I feel now. I want to buy a Bow Flex adjustable weight dumbbell set, but I'm waiting for an awesome sale to kick in. The dumbbells I own are 5, 8, 10, and 15 pounds. I really wish I had a 12 pound set. I have 1 22 pound weight, and wish I had 20, 25, and 30. I just don't want all that equipment in my family room, thus my wish for the Bow Flex. Unfortunately it may be Christmas time before the awesome sales hit... So the downside of this program is that you need to invest in some equipment.",1437091200,,753,3.960526315789474
8558101,4,B00AVWLX2G,"I've only done a few of these exercises so far and the tabata is by far the hardest I've ever done. I'm in great shape and workout every day, but was swearing by the middle of this one. Haha. I've done 21 day fix, insanity, turbo fire, ALL of Jillian Michaels programs and DVDs and cathe def measures up. She's created a powerful program, that's fun, instructional and not easy! Also, I am NOT a fan of step aerobics. I used to do it when it was popular and even then tripped over my own feet. Lol. With that said, hers is fun and easy so I didn't feel silly.

So should you buy...I'd say yes, if you are looking for a new program. The reviews are all positive on all websites. Plus if you've worn out all the other workout DVD programs and dread doing them, hers def mixes it up! I've done them all and after a while all these current trainers... Ie. Jillian, beach body, Jackie, etc use similar moves and styles. Cathe brings their type of training into other forms both old and new. Made the workouts less repetitive and fresh.  **I do want to note that there is A LOT of extra equipment you have to buy, and although I already workout from home, I didn't have anything but the weights and heavy weight bag/gloves. So I ended up spending another 200 for equipment along with the program. I'm not too worried about it, bc they are all things I should have in my home gym. Ie: step platform, stability ball, loop bands, slide discs (I'm using furniture gliders and THEY WORK THE SAME! Yahoo), and a few heavier Dumbbells as I usually use weights under 8lbs. :)

**This is not a review for the DVD set... More of an observation that I found while researching if I should buy it and found this... Odd. I googled ""xtrain results/ before and after photos, etc"" and couldn't find ANY! When you google just the name 21 day fix, Jillian Michaels, or insanity, a million before and after photos will populate on google images. Maybe this is just a marketing scheme, BUT I didn't like that there weren't any for this program. In the technology era ppl are typically itching to post before and after photos on every social media site out there, so you can see why I was surprised not to fine any... I fact I didn't for any of Cathes programs really.

She's been around FOREVER and her programs are NOT easy... So why hasn't anyone posted their results? I like seeing them... When I did 21 day fix extreme I had similar results to those I saw, which only motivated me more. It's not seeing ""regular"" people have amazing body transformations! I guess... Not seeing them made me a bit skeptical. Will I gain TOO much muscle? (Which I personally dislike) Will I lose weight/inches? Honestly, I don't know... I haven't seen or heard anyone say they lost a great deal of weight. I haven't seen pictures where women have giant arms after the program... Or slim ones.

I guess I will have to wait and see. I just hope after the programs end... I didn't waste 90 days by not getting the results I'm looking for... Eeek!!!! :)

Another side note... Please don't take the last portion as negative. Especially all of you die hard Cathe fans! I'm not bashing, just making an observation. This program has def kicked my butt thus far, so I'll be shocked if I don't reap any benefits. :) we'll see!",1436745600,,3274,4.412251655629139
