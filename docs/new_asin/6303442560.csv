7846886,4,6303442560,"This is the enjoyable, interesting and often moving story of Jose Mojica (1896-1974), the Mexican tenor who, after a career in opera, became a movie star, and then joined the Order of Franciscans while still a popular even idolised singer.

The young actor who portrayed Fra Jose's early life looked very like the photos and films I had seen of the tenor, and generally lip-synched well to what I have read was the actual singing of Mojica himself. If that is true, then Fra Jose, who would have been in his late sixties at the time of the film's making (1965?), must have carefully husbanded his singing voice, which is preserved on the soundtrack in many arias, songs and duets.

Few artistic liberties have been taken with the story of the singer's life as told in his  autobiography, which also is titled: ""I, A Sinner"".

Now, if only Ward Marston the skilled reviver of older recordings would refurbish and re-issue the RCA early electrical recordings, particularly of the operatic recordings, as he already has for the Mojica Edison acoustics.

Mojica claimed to be a particular favourite singer of Thomas Edison, whose company had recorded the young artist during his rise to success at the Chicago Opera. Ironically, Mojica, like Edison, became profoundly deaf in later life.",1099180800,15,1283,4.921296296296297
