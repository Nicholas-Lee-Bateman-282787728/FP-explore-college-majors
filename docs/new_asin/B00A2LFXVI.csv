5378927,5,B00A2LFXVI,"What can you say, The Dark Knight Returns was a classic. The video is a good shot at it, but I will wait until part two for my full recommendation.",1355702400,,147,3.933333333333333
5378928,5,B00A2LFXVI,This was very enjoyable.  I just wish they would make more and LONGER animated productions.  The 72 minute format can barely get any character development going.,1355702400,2,161,5.153846153846154
5378929,5,B00A2LFXVI,"IT IS DARK, MAN! IT IS CREEPY! IT MAKES YOU FEEL EXTREMELY SHIVERING!!!!! And IT IS ONE OF CLASSICS THAT EVERY BATMAN FAN OR NON-FAN WILL Like!!!!!!!!!!!
Justice never retires. You read this book and you will know it. All potential buyers, trust me, you are in for a show.....",1355529600,4,276,4.54
5378930,5,B00A2LFXVI,"Ignore that idiot reviewer about showing movies in a van to kids, clearly that is a joke because he wrote the same review on Dark Knight Returns Part 1.  This movie is the top of DC's animation.  Fantastic storyline getting justice done in the form of an animated movie.",1355011200,4,270,4.489795918367347
5378931,1,B00A2LFXVI,I thought I ordered the new movie but ended up with a cartoon.  I am sure my son will enjoy it.,1354233600,3,95,3.5238095238095237
5378932,5,B00A2LFXVI,"This movie is what Batman fans have been waiting for. THE Batman tale written by legendary comic writer Frank Miller is finally animated. Usually I find it to be ridiculous and a simple money grab to split a book into two movies. But it is a necessity for this one. The story is too complex for a 76 minute movie which is direct to DVD movie length. The animation is great and it really stays true to the source. I can't wait until I'm able to watch both parts back to back. These two will put the Nolan movies to shame. This tale was also the inspiration for Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises. (Just as Frank Millers other story and animated film, Batman Year One, inspired Batman Begins)",1354233600,12,685,4.359375
5378933,5,B00A2LFXVI,"Ignorant reviewers aside, this movie is outstanding. It stays true to the source material and presents a future darker than anyone, including Batman, could have imagined. Peter Weller was the perfect choice for an older Batman. I only wish there was more to the story (but please, WB, don't animate Dark Knight Strikes Again).",1353369600,40,326,5.055555555555555
5378934,5,B00A2LFXVI,"This is fantastic! Just can't beat it, I wish there was a part 3! You won't regret seeing it. This review is mostly to undo a fake post.",1353283200,37,136,3.892857142857143
5378935,1,B00A2LFXVI,"As a small business owner (yes Obama, I did build that), I run a mobile movie theather from my van for kids with a personal touch. Dress up, face painting, role playing, massages and free candy. Although my van does not have the best gas mileage, I still feel that the oportunity for the service offesets the actual cost. Having a target audience helps me specialize in the movies that I try to cater, maintain and bring in new patrons. I have access to most movies before they actually arrive for sale on the mass market and sometimes, at the theaters. This is due in part  to a local vendor I frequent that has some international connections. To keep things legit, I would say that I do not ask too many questions, but his English is pretty minimal so things are easier left unsaid.
After viewing the movie, I honestly can not say that I am impressed.
Yes, the book is revered as sacred Batman AND comic book canon, but that simply does not cut it for me.
Granted, I have never read the source material that it was based off since I am not a fan of the sloppy, artwork of heavyset people.
Sure, people will rave on how wonderful the book is, how it redefined the genre and influenced so many other great works. To be honest, that is something that came out twenty-five-plus years ago and this review is not about that book. In fact, there are umpteen something reviews on that book that somehow, each author believes is the most definitive review.
Rather, this review is about the movie.
The shoddy animation and pretentious and blatantly amateurish voice work in what assumes itself to be a masterpiece. That assumption is clearly limited to the confinines of the imagination found with those involved it's realization. I found myself bored and almost annoyed at what comes across to me as unoriginal poorman's work riding on the coattails in what they thought was great.
Likely, WB will continue to milk this raddish by combining the two movies in some special edition with more self-serving background features that would make the likes of Peter Jackson jealous.
I will go ahead and show this movie from my van, but I doubt I will keep it for very long since it takes up precious space for bigger movers like ""Santa Paws 2.""",1353283200,6,2229,4.5725

5378947,5,B00A2LFXVI,Excellent! Glad I saw this before Dawn of Justice. It gives much more context to the fight between Batman and Superman. I loved Peter Weller as the voice of Bruce Wayne/Batman!,1474156800,,176,4.709677419354839
5378948,4,B00A2LFXVI,"A decent adaptation of Frank Miller's iconic graphic novel.  Its hard to translate something so amazing to another medium, but they did a solid job of it.  The voice acting was good, and the voices fit the characters from the graphic novel.  There were some things that had to be done a bit differently because its hard to convey what a character is thinking, and a lot of Miller's best work is presenting what's going on inside his character's heads, even minor characters.  I don't know that there was a better way to get that across than how they chose to incorporate it.  Its definitely worth the watch.",1473724800,,607,4.583333333333333
5378949,4,B00A2LFXVI,"It is a great film, but it tries to achieve too much towards the end and the story becomes a bit muddled.",1472774400,,105,3.8181818181818183

5378979,5,B00A2LFXVI,"Don't bother with Batman v Superman.  Buy this.  This is the bold source material Hollywood is diluting to make a CGI-fest movie.  This is Frank Miller the writer at his best, before old age and self-absorption took hold. Batman is you, the mortal, fighting to overcome a god through planning, wits, body and will.  His daring to even fight the immortal man from the heavens/space evokes admiration of the audience.  Do not miss this.",1451347200,,434,4.8108108108108105

People hate him cause they hate greatness, even in comic book characters.

And is the Joker superhuman? How does the take that beating and beating and have no impairment the whole fight?

Dumbness.

Don't get me started on ""I want you to remember the one man who beat you"" ... does a mosquito beat a human if the human lets it sting him and get malaria for some reason? Silly Batworship movie. How many minutes in a row do we have to watch Batman dodging bullets.",1443398400,,559,4.355769230769231

The only thing that was missing was the inward thoughts Bruce struggled with in the comics. I still give this 5 stars.  Part 2 was incredible. The joker and the superman battles were epic.

5379007,4,B00A2LFXVI,"This is the conclusion to the Dark Knight story.  I really enjoyed it, my complaints are very few.  I feel that Peter Weller was phoning it in.  During Batman the Animated Series showed ""Tales of the Dark Knight"", they had Michael Ironside voice the future Dark Knight and he had the gravity that Peter Weller didn't.  Also the actor who played the Joker, just wasn't there, he didn't have that mania that you would have expected. The battle between with Batman and Superman is as epic as it is in the comics and worth it alone.",1426550400,,528,4.46875
5379008,4,B00A2LFXVI,"This is NOT a kid's Batman cartoon. If you are cautious about what you let your kids view, then be informed that there is some rough language and a considerable amount of violence. This one EARNS the PG-13. Having said that, it's a great story line, the writing and voice acting are right on, and it's definitely a new take on an old Batman.",1425427200,,341,4.34375
5379009,5,B00A2LFXVI,If you're a Batman fan this is a must see.  Frank Miller's version of an aging Batman with a new female robins is a different take on Batman adventures.  I really enjoyed this movie a lot.  The Superman and Joker fight scene against Batman will become a classic.  Voice acting was on outstanding.  If you haven't seen this version of Batman I suggest you pay a dollar more and get both Batman The Dark Knight Returns part 1 and part 2.,1425340800,,435,4.320987654320987

5379052,3,B00A2LFXVI,"A decent movie up until the garbage ending where Batman somehow gets super powers all of a sudden and trades punches with Superman. Total BS. It's obvious Frank Miller just hates Superman. Superman has always gotten the better of Batman in the comics except for non-canon stories like Frank Miller's trash DKR. For all you non-comic fans out there ""non-canon"" means that the story was never part of comic continuity (history).  In all the comics which are part of comic continuity in which Bats and Supes have fought it's been clearly shown that Superman is Batman's superior by far.

5379067,5,B00A2LFXVI,"This is an animated masterpiece!  Some people don't like Frank Miller's version of Batman, which is non-canonical, but who cares?  I am more interested in having a great story than preserving some narrow interpretation of the Batman and this movie delivers an epic that is both refreshing and familiar.

I won't go over any plot details as you should experience it for yourself without predisposition, but suffice it to say, this is a darker, grittier, and, in some ways, more realistic portrayal of the Batman.  A common motif among the franchise is how Batman is a symbol for Gotham City and, albeit, not necessary a pleasant one.  This Batman both terrifies and inspires and it is this sophisticated dichotomy that gives such richness to the character.

Further, they say art imitates life and this story includes some references to real life politics and social issues.  These aren't frivolous references that are casually tossed in.  Rather, they are meant to give realism and credibility to the movie by providing a cultural backdrop we can all understand and relate to.

This film is truly a work of art.",1398124800,,1111,4.93010752688172

It's everything you'd want from a movie, it's just too bad it's a cartoon. The animation is not bad but it looks bad sometimes, and you are always reminded that you're watching something instead of getting immersed into the story.

I will not give away any of the spoilers but Bruce Wayne has been retired for 10 years now until the crime in Gotham has gotten so far out of hand that Bruce's conscience get's the better of him and he decides to return as The Batman, Robin is in this movie as well but the circumstances that Robin becomes Batman's side kick is very original, and this time Robin is just a 15 year old girl. This is all I will say about the movies except that I give this 2 part Movie 5 of 5 stars and highly recommend that if you are a fan of Batman you will thoroughly enjoy these movies and want to add them to your collection just as I have.",1393891200,,711,4.049645390070922

So other than reading the comics, this is the best way to get my fantasy fix. So please don't take it lightly when I say this is the best movie I've ever rented. It is NOT for small children, but comic fans will love it...and Batman fans will really love it. Don't spoil it for yourself by watching the trailer or reading the synopsis. The twists were excellent and the use of existing DC characters was tremendous. You do have to watch Part 1 first, which I rated 4 stars as it was very good. But this was excellent IMO.",1393372800,,688,4.259541984732825

5379083,5,B00A2LFXVI,"This is an outstanding adaption of ""The Dark Knight Returns pt2"" which is the sequel to a critically acclaimed graphic novel by Frank Miller. It picks up exactly where the last one left off. This time batman has to take on both the joker and superman. This one has a  bit more action than the first one. I have to warn you that this one is also more violent too. It could have very easily have been rated ""R"", but I would not have had a problem with that. In this cartoon, the joker gets out from the asylum and pushes batman to the brink of complete rage while having him question his own morals. Then the ""man of steel"" arrives in Gotham and now he's a government enforcer coming to challenge the dark knight. Just like part 1, part 2 is very faithful to the graphic novel. If your a fan of Miller's novels like i am, then you should enjoy these adaptions.

1) If you are one of the people who think Ronald Reagan was a warmongering coward who gave no thought to throwing troops in to harm's way to support his anti-Communist attitude the you'll LOVE this movie.  Reagan even sends out Superman to stop the commies.  I couldn't help thinking that if this was witten in our time we'd have G.W. Bush after bin laden but I digress.
If you are into police brutality this flick is for you.  New Commissioner Yendel places a warrant on Batman for breaking and entering, assault and battery and creating a public nuisance and then goes after him with cops shooting to kill.  And she says Batman's a vigilante?
Good adaptation of the graphic novel & I wash DC and Marvel would work together and greenlight a video of JLA/Avengers.",1389830400,,782,4.63768115942029

This time there are forces everywhere trying to stop him, even someone he has known as a friend.  He is helped by his sidekick Robin,and of course Alfred, as well as others who appear throughout.  This is part two of The  Batman, the Dark Knight Returns.  Watch part 1 of this story, equally good.

There are aspects of this movie which lead you to understand the plight Batman has had to live with each time he let's a ruthless criminal live out there days incarcerated.  One of which proves that letting him live means that countless will die.

This was a Batman story in true form, reminding me of the cartoons I use to watch as a child,  now made for me as an adult.  I hope to see more well crafted animations from Warner Brothers and DC.",1388707200,,908,4.319526627218935

5379097,5,B00A2LFXVI,"This happens to be a fairly faithful adaptation of the acclaimed graphic novel.  There are some differences but nothing that would ruin the experience as a whole.  The fact that it has a PG-13 rating isn't much of an issue or handicap, there are only a few things that have been toned down from the graphic novel.  I'm not totally convinced that without the toned down moments that the movie would have received an R rating, but it would probably have been too close for producers, etc.

The biggest issue I have is that the graphic novel was broken up into two films, bleh.  This one covers the graphic novel from the conclusion of the mutant gang storyline to the final conclusion.  It does have some other issues though that should be mentioned with the voice casting and direction.

Peter Weller does an adequate job as Bruce Wayne/Batman but for some reason the almost monotone gravitas of his voice doesn't seem to matchup with the animation style on screen.  I don't blame Weller for this, that fault lies squarely at the directors doorstep.  Beyond that, and in all truthfulness, the remaining supporting voice cast is irrelevant.  I wonder if the studio could have sprung a for a few extra bucks to hire some other celebrities (at least enough for the B or C list level of celebrity).  I can't imagine that Mark Hamil is so busy these days that he couldn't have been persuaded to do the voice of the Joker.  Seriously, he's not that busy. Sigh . . . . . wasted opportunity of a colossal order.  (In case you were unaware, he's been doing the voice of the Joker in the animated series' for years).  For that matter, the David Endocrine voice actor could have at least sounded like David Letterman but whatever.

Regardless, an opportunity that was lost by the director when some of the internal narration of the characters thoughts was completely omitted from the film.  I personally think it would have added considerable depth to the film to have heard both Batman's and Superman's thoughts in the lead up to the conclusion.

As a side note: after watching the film and then rethinking the graphic novel or a min or two, I've come to the conclusion that Superman was a bit of an ((*&^%&  in both the graphic novel and the film.  He's Superman for crying out loud, did he really have to sink the Soviet air craft carrier etc.? I would imagine this caused a serious loss of life on the Soviet side which, when you consider Superman's powers and abilities, is basically needless.  Considering the extreme disparity of power between the Soviets & the American forces + Superman, this really ends up being on the side of mass murder.  But I digress.",1388534400,,2654,4.616204690831556
5379098,5,B00A2LFXVI,"The movie picks up perfectly after part 1. The psychological thought behind this coincides with current times and feelings. Though in my mind is a lost cause. Anyway, the action is great. The confrontation between Batman and Superman is what I would have expected. Special armor to enhance Batmans ability. The surprise guest was certainly not expected but also left open questions???
The only part I didn't care for was how they used the presidency as joke.

Michael Ironside did the voice of Batman in an adaption/excerpt of this story called Legends of the Dark Knight which aired on The New Batman Adventures which was a continuation of WB Animation's Batman: the Animated Series.  I feel his performance in the earlier adaption was much better than Peter Weller's in this version.  In my opinion Keven Conroy's Batman is the definitive Batman but Michael Ironside brought a gravitas and brutality to his version of Batman that Peter Weller was not able to match.  I can buy Peter Weller as anything from Robocop to a Starfleet Admiral, just not Batman.",1378944000,,662,4.831858407079646

5379135,1,B00A2LFXVI,"I appear to be the minority when it come to what I think of this movie.  I liked Part 1, I thought it had a pretty good story line and lots of excitement and a few twists and turns that I didn't see coming (like Batman having to adjust his tactics in battle because he's retirement age and his body can't do what it used to be able to do to defeat someone in hand to hand combat).  When I saw Part 2 would have The Joker as its central villian I thought it couldn't go wrong.  I was wrong.  I was expecting The Joker, eventhough he's retirement age like Batman, to be his loud, cackleing, over the top self (if you're familiar with the franchise, I was expecting him to be like the way Mark Hammil portrayed him in the tv series and in several movies).  Boy was I wrong.  This Joker still kills people, but he's soft spoken, and seems like he's just going through the motions of what everyone thinks he's supposed to do, it's almost like he's a shadow of his former self, granted he's been in a vegetative state since Batman retired but how much effort does it really take to at least sound like your enthused about getting the best of the hero.  The Joker's almost complete lack of enthuisaism, by itself is what caused me to give the movie one star.  A lacklust Joker is no Joker at all.",1376265600,,1289,4.211382113821138

5379137,5,B00A2LFXVI,"I read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-The-Dark-Knight-Returns/dp/1563893428/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</a>&nbsp;by Frank Miller back in the 1980s when it originally came out as a four-issue, prestige format mini-series.  I didn't love it.  In fact, I had to force my way through it.  I purchased and watched the animated movie version of it, though, and found myself appreciating it much more.  While Part 1 of the movie is necessary because it sets up Part 2, Part 2 is really the more interesting and engaging DVD.  It features Superman, the Joker, and Catwoman.  Like the Batman, these three characters have aged and play different roles in society.  It's interesting to see where they've wound up.  The Joker is in prison but seemingly reformed; he's invited to a talk show for an interview.  Catwoman is overweight and runs a high-end escort service.  Batman has a new female Robin partner, Carrie Kelley, doesn't add much to the story other than shock value.

The story is set in a bleak future.  The Cold War is looming.  The crimes in Gotham City bring Batman out of retirement to save the city one last time.  He runs into interference from Superman, who now works as the president's pawn.  The president looks and sounds very much like Ronald Reagan, and the story mocks him and his administration.

The animation reminded me a lot of the comic's artwork in the series, and I think it worked really well for the movie.  Yes, Batman and Superman are grotesquely and unnaturally muscular, but it works for the feel of the movie and isn't distracting.

Part 2 is far better than Part 1, but I recommend watching both in one sitting to get the full story.",1375920000,,1744,5.124113475177305

5379140,5,B00A2LFXVI,"There's so much to love about this film I hardly know where to start. First, it's based on the Frank Miller graphic novel by the same name, and having read said GN, I can confirm that the film follows the GN very closely! This is definitely a fan film, made by Batman fans FOR Batman fans.

By Part 2, the Mutant gang has been dealt with already, so the action in this second half revolves around the battle with Superman (ordered by President Ronald Reagan). Batman has cleaned up crime in Gotham, and the local officials have failed to apprehend him so the president steps in and sends Superman. (If you recall from Part 1, the president had passed the buck to the governor regarding dealing with Batman--but this time he takes action himself).

The voice acting was superb again, but I was disappointed that the voice of batman changed. Peter Weller's deep bass was a potent thing in the first part. While the voice actor does a good job in Part 2, it just isn't near enough to Weller and is a bit of a distraction until you get used to the change.

The graphic novel changed comic book audiences from that time on. No longer were they for kids and teens - this was written for those same kids who have grown up. (I even believe it was instrumental in paving the way for Tim Burton's movies) Anyway, these animated movies follow the Graphic Novel exactly! At one point I had the graphic novel out while the movie was going and even the backgrounds are right out of the book. Besides seeing the frames animated, the only other addition to the novel was the music soundtrack which I was impressed with.

These are rather faithful adaptations of the greatest Batman story of all time, ""The Dark Knight Returns, "" by the brilliant Frank Miller.

When the chapters of this graphic novel were first released in 1986, readers everywhere in the country had their minds blown.  For the first time, the whole concept of Batman and the comic book universe he lives in was elevated to the level of actual literature.  Comic book elements important to the genre were still there, brutal fights, impossible gizmos, over-the-top dramatics - but all done in a fresh way that gave these elements new life in the context of the dark, futuristic world Miller created.

As a big fan of the original work, I'm very pleased with these animations, especially since much of Miller's unique illustrative style is captured all throughout.

Great story, very well done, and a worthy modern homage to Miller's masterpiece.  DON'T buy this series as just more discs to toss in the kid's stack - These two parts make up a big, epic adult movie as gripping as the live action Nolan trilogy.

This is one of those books I've read countless times and although the movie is good, it doesn't do justice to the book.  I love this story because it is the story of freedom, humanity, and courage.  When the world is at its darkest hour the people themselves rise up and take control.  Batman may lead the charge but it is the people of Gotham that no longer wait for super-men to save them, they save themselves.  I guess without spoiling anything I will leave it there, but I will say, as many times as I have read the book there is always a part at the end that chokes me up.

This time Batman must deal with a Gotham police force that wants him arrested, The Joker newly roused after seeing Batman's return, and even Superman. The action is brutal and intense, perhaps even more so than the first part, and the commentary on political and social matters is just as much a part of this part as it was in the first.

If you've seen the first part, I shouldn't even have to sell you on this one. Just watch it. And if you haven't go watch that one first, and then this one. These are serious Batman tales, that made so many insightful predictions that are frighteningly accurate to our modern age, and address serious issues of morality and justice.

The Batman has not been seen in decades, and Bruce Wayne decides as an old man to make him come back.

This is the conclusion of the story that starts with the tired, old, broken Wayne taking up the cowl again and setting a world that doesn't know it needs him right.  This story features Batman kicking Superman's butt, too, so that is worth the price of admission.",1373068800,,562,4.264150943396227

Of course, you could argue that all the characters have been built up already through the previous films/comics/TV series, but this film threw the action in and kept it coming without taking much time to examine why Batman felt a certain way when Joker said certain things. Also, I feel like his backstory with Superman could have been explained a little better too. It's not like everyone watching this is familiar with the comics or The Justice League. Also, where was Batman hiding this super strength suit during the first part of the movie?! Regardless, it was a great movie! Would recommend it to any batman fan.",1372550400,,775,4.7481481481481485

That being said, the first two thirds of the film were filled with tedious and pointless ""action"" in which Batman spent more time beating up the police than he did the bad guys; often with very little apparent motivation. This is a pretty jarring change of behavior for a character who has always had a very good reason for every action he's ever taken.

Final thought, if you are even considering purchasing this movie on DVD, I very strongly recommend that you rent it first - try it before you buy it - you may be glad you did.",1371168000,,903,4.125
5379178,5,B00A2LFXVI,DKR Pt. II was everything I hoped it would be!  I'm very pleased with how both parts came out and am glad that I bought both.  If you're a Batman fan than these movies are MUST SEE.,1370995200,,181,3.864864864864865
5379179,3,B00A2LFXVI,"The movie followed the graphic novel quite, but is was equally violent.  The plot was every bit as excellent as I've come to expect from the Batman series.",1370908800,,155,4.535714285714286
5379180,3,B00A2LFXVI,"This review is mainly to give other old school folks like me a heads up (especially if you have never read the graphic novel).

Great concept and one of the best executions of a book to film.

So, the reason for 3 instead of 5 stars?  The only reason I can't fully recommend it is because of violence and topless lady (w/ other sexuality).  Now, I realize it was very close to the graphic novel, but there seemed to be an extra long time focusing on the lady without a top.  I can only take strategically placed arms and guns over breasts for so long, and it just seemed to go on and on.  Even the scene with the Senator seemed more vulgar (I admit they may not have been, but when something becomes moving it seems more intense and thus, more vulgar).  The  Violence aspect was also close to the graphic novel, but again animating it with all the people being shot was just too much for me.  I am glad I watched it on Amazon and did not buy it.  It was worth watching once.",1370908800,,974,4.160427807486631

5379184,5,B00A2LFXVI,"This was a total work of art and I loved it!  From the clash with the Joker and his demise (Wow....really) and his battle with Superman, it hit every level with me, and I'm easy to please.  The way that Bruce Wayne called it goodbye for his character made sense, but I really didn't want it to go there.  Batman is my favorite and I wanted it to go on and on, however, you have to know when to hit the brakes...and he did.  The new Robin will take some getting use to. I'm not a big fan of hers, so she will have to grow on me.  That being said, I really loved this movie, and I'm sure that this won't be the last.  DC will just make movies of his younger self and I will just buy those like I did this.  GOOD WORK, DC!!!",1369958400,,721,3.8639455782312924

I'm not too far gone, meaning I realize this is an animation based on a Superhero, but I like my animation dipped into a little realism, this video has none. Batman is an old man, that part is cool, but he get's shot at CONSTANTLY and never gets hit, no stealth, just everyone misses. The mutants look ridiculous, Joker's voice is terrible, and how does Robin get sooo good soo fast?

Great aspects of this film include the return of The Joker, Carrie Kelly as Robin helping Batman in his new war on crime, and of course Superman having to make a tough decision on how to take Batman in custody. I highly recommend this film as well as of course part 2, mostly because you can't see this film without seeing part 1. However, it's only recommended to those who can handle the Dark Content of these 2 films.",1367971200,,574,4.275229357798165

5379198,4,B00A2LFXVI,"The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 is the sequel to part one of the animated adaptation to Frank Miller's comic The Dark Knight Returns. In my opinion, this film is just as great as part 1. Personally, I enjoy this film a little better than part one. That mostly has to do with Batman dealing with the Joker and Superman in this one.

Dark Knight Returns Part 2 takes place a few months after the events of part 1. Batman, played again by Peter Weller, has returned and is cleaning up Gotham with his sidekick Carrie Kelly a.k.a. Robin played once again my Ariel Winter. Also, the mutant gang from part 1 has reformed into a new group called the sons of Batman, who now fight for Batman. Commissioner Gordon has retired. The new commissioner taking his place labels him a criminal and issues a warrant for his arrest. The government also does not like Batman coming back so the president sends Superman to force him back into retirement. The Joker also is lose again and wishes to take out Batman as well. Batman has to over come the odds and restore Gotham to order.

I really enjoy this film, even more than part 1. This is mainly because I find the Joker and Superman to be better adversaries than the mutant gang. The voice acting is good for the most part. Peter Weller and Ariel Winter do a good job once again. The person who voices Superman, whose name escapes me, does a fine job. He is not as good as Tim Dale, but does fine.

However, I am not a big fan of this Joker. His look does nothing for me, and neither does his voice. Michael Emerson voices the Joker in this. I am a fan of Emerson in Lost, but here is performance as a bit lacking. Overall I liked him better than John DiMaggio's Joker in Under the Red Hood. However, this Joker is still one of my least favorite Jokers.

The art and animation are the same as part one, no change. I thought it was fine overall. The action is great, mainly the final battle between Superman and Batman. This fight is my favorite fight of both movies.

Overall if you are a fan of Frank Miller's comic and of Dark Knight Returns part 1, you need to watch this.",1367625600,2,2109,4.302267002518891
5379199,3,B00A2LFXVI,"The experience of renting  online is convenience, but it is missing the inside features, it would be nice to be able to watch the trailers for the upcoming animated DC movies, creative team commentating or the small short film that most of the time accompany this films as well.",1367452800,,278,4.673469387755102

5379207,5,B00A2LFXVI,"Sometimes you get that feeling that maybe batman was a bit too nice in these nolan films that maybe he was too emotional for someone with such a tragic back round. In this 2 part movie that changes and batman is what he should be a sullen, angry, brooding individual who wages a true WAR on crime as he encounters the joker for one last time. The joker is vastly different from any other time you've seen him, his voice is a new direction and his outward appearance is much more subtle than any other although his psychotic nature is seen with ALMOST no restraint as he seems even more serial killer like than the 2008 Dark Knight take (and i do stress the ""killer"" part). Batman matches that with brutality almost never seen from him both towards the joker and the war against the police who are after batman the entire time. The rest of the movie deals with political struggle during the cold war nightmare scenario which pits the eager to serve Superman against the renegade Batman in a battle to try and prove whos philosophy wins out at the end of the day",1366848000,,1060,4.413265306122449

5379211,4,B00A2LFXVI,Part 1 and 2 just seem like totally different movies.  To me they shouldn't have labeled them part 1 and part 2.  I know it's based off the comic and that's fine.

5379219,5,B00A2LFXVI,"Part 2 of the Animated DC Universe title 'Batman: The Dark Knight Returns' is a near-perfect film. I'm a huge fan of the DC Animated Universe and my excitement leading up to the release of the adaptation of one of the best graphic novels of all time was evident. Warner Bros. better be careful because I'm not sure how much better they can get. While past DCU Animated films were hit-or-miss, the only hits and misses in this film come from the cringe-worthy and eye-popping moments delivered throughout.
This is, quite possibly, the most disturbing animated film you will ever see with the Batman name one it. Frank Miller's original graphic novel rebooted Batman for readers and generations to come and this film does indeed do it justice - especially when it comes to showcasing Miller's version of Joker - the most demented, beyond-twisted criminal on screen. Just how twisted Joker is are driven in with literal ""bangs"" and he gleefully hops around, fatally shooting whomever he sees. This is the Joker that - even on the page in a static image - would inspire every variation of the Joker to come. No longer the Ceasar Romero giggly version of the 60s, the Joker is twisted and demented. Without Frank Miller's Joker, we would not have Mark Hamill and Heath Ledger's Joker variations.
The inspiration given to Christopher Nolan for his Batman Trilogy is also evident within, as the aging Bruce Wayne struggles to deal with his own mortality as well as the mortality of the people he cares about.
As awesome as it is, the only weak point of the film is also my least favorite part of the graphic novel - everything slides a little bit once Superman enters the picture. While Miller's visuals are stunning, the story does slide from Batman to the god-like Kryptonian a little too much for my taste, yet the ending paints a picture of just how indestructible a mere man can be.

If you're a fan of Batman, DCU, Frank Miller, or just the original graphic novel, I have to recommend these films. They are incredible and probably the best offering yet from the Animated DC Universe.",1366156800,,2082,4.704109589041096

5379223,1,B00A2LFXVI,"To start, I would consider myself a more than average Dark Knight/Frank Miller fanatic.  I read these when they were out in the 1980's and I still say the graphic novel itself is still probably one of the most influential pieces of work which have transcended into most superhero films of today.  I thought Part 1 was okay and I was really hopeful for Part 2.  It was pretty much unwatchable.  The voice casting and direction was amateur.  The animation, while I admit Miller's graphic novel is gritty, attempts to capture some of the iconic scenes but fails miserably.  What I think is missing in both films which I will admit may have been hard to capture is the interior dialogues.  I think this was Miller's best work as to why we understand how all of the characters were the way they were.  I think it worked in the movie ""Sin City"" and it was disrespectful to the fans of the graphic novels not to include it.

Also, I detested the PG-13 sanitization of the books:  Gordon smoked cigars, Joker does kill a alot of kids at the fair with poisoned cotton candy.  If Warner Brothers is not going to do the adaptation truthfully then don't do it at all.

5379246,4,B00A2LFXVI,"If I say that this adaptation could've been much better, it gives a misleading impression that it wasn't excellent, but it was!  The story and animation was very close to that of the graphic novel, and the overall movie was extremely enjoyable.  I did, however, not like the way they left out the internal monologues, which I thought added a lot to the characterisations in the book.  I wonder if they did it because of memories of the negative reactions to the voice-over in Bladerunner, or if it was just an artistic decision. Either way, it was a bad idea.

I was also a bit disappointed with the casting - Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill have built incredible identities as the voices of Batman and the Joker, and in this version they are sorely missed.  Peter Weller has a great voice but it just isn't 'heroic' enough, and Michael Emerson as the Joker doesn't seem quite as maniacally joyous in his mischief.

These criticisms are really just the fussing of an obsessed fan.  I enjoyed the movie(s) immensely, and would recommend them to everyone!",1364083200,2,1050,4.673913043478261

It is a truly rare occurrence when a comic adaptation is kept true to its source and this one is about as faithful as it can get.  I was iffy when I heard Petter Weller was going to be voicing Batman but to my surprise, he pulls off the older weary Batman perfectly.  I have seen some people complain about the art in some of the reviews here.  The art is actually a faithful reproduction of the stylized art of the original pencil artist for the comic books.  As for those people that gave it one star complaining the they were mislead by the title, sorry but thats the original title of the 25 year old comic.  They did not name it that way to trick you into buying it.  The first sentence of the product description states that it is animated and the box art is a comic book drawing.  In my opinion a great story that will not leave you disappointed even if the purchase price is a little steep considering you have to buy part one and part two.

I read the graphic novel these DVD's are based on in the Mid 90's but unlike many of my friends I had no real desire to see it brought to the screen. I had two reasons for this. The first was Hollywood almost never gets the transition from Book to Motion Picture catastrophically WRONG! The second was personal I just did not enjoy the experience of a Post Justice League World.  It was depressing and I get enough actual political stupidity in my life on a daily basis I don't need it in my escapism. Besides the Idea of CADMIS winning in the end just rubbed me the wrong way. I WAS WRONG in every possible way. As Good as Andrea Romano has been in the past as a Voice director she continues to out do herself with every new project. Casting Peter Weller as Bruce Wayne/Batman and Michael Emerson as The Joker was inspired and their performances were even better than Bruce Greenwood and John DiMaggio's in Batman-Under The Red Hood which I considered to be the best BATMAN film to this point.

Part one gives you the Foundation for this new Batman's story, old-man Batman coming back after years of retirement to clean up Gotham again!

For those who didn't read comics in the 80s, here's a scoop, during a good portion of that time the President made a decree that ""Superheroes"" were to stop their activities because it was seen that the Heroes were creating the super-villains and causing public discourse, all that BS that in the modern age this is no time for Heroes!  Ok keep that in mind when you see this, because it's important, and also get ready for some great political jabs, plenty of guest heroes and villains (some being former villains, but eh...details).

5379269,5,B00A2LFXVI,"Great movie.  Parts 1 and 2 are, at this point, the most interesting DC productions I have seen this far.
I can't recommend both episodes enough and find myself hungry for more productions of this caliber or a part 3,
at the very least.

Although I was skeptical of Peter Weller as Batman, he pretty much knocked it out of the park. Nicely done Pete.
Honestly, the entire production exceeded all my expectations.  I absolutely loved the way they used the
longstanding, strained relationship between Batman and Superman.  It takes the mood of the Justice League
series and movies, fast forwarded it to the point of the characters being aged, added the dark truth of reality
and really made it work.

My only regrets are that I only have five stars to offer AND see no indication of a part 3. The end of
part 2 could really go in many interesting directions.

By the way, the choice for the persona of president was hysterical and just too much fun. I was surprised and
delighted.  Far be it from me to be a spoiler.  If you are not a pup, I think most will find it surprising and
quite funny.

Although this one will be hard to match, I look forward to seeing more DC movies of if this nature
and caliber. I believe it would have wide appeal to long-term fans like myself and, while a younger audience
might not ""get"" everything, the edgy nature of the movie should appeal to them equally well.

I watched this directly after seeing Part 1 thinking that there was no way they could top it. They did. Batman, in an animated form, finally dealt with Joker in an appropriate manner. I know that there have always been restrictions to TAS because of their timeslot and the audience they were targeting. Now that those of us who watched it while growing up are grown up, these direct to video releases can be more  true to some of the stories that we have read in Graphic Novels. This one is PG-13 and I think they toed that line pretty well.

This animated feature does not disappoint and vividly brings the ground breaking comic to life. The animation is well done and the voice acting is spot on. For a direct to video release the production value is very high. Also the film makes no compromises and sticks to Miller's story even keeping it placed in an 80ish era with slang and people from that time. A must see for fans.

The original story is from the Eighties and basically took the Batman from the camp to the Dark Knight.  This is an older version of Chris Nolan's view.  More reviewers will tell the story.  I was watching the style.  It is the style that Miller made the story in.  The DCU animation group are the best.  Miller also wrote Sin City and worked with Rodriguez for the movie.  His touch shines in both movies.  The older, chunkier Batman who has to use his mind as much as his body and realizes he can no longer do this on his own is an effective character.  There is also a secondary Canon that was formed by this novel,  which involves Superman and Green Arrow.  Remnants of this was used when they later killed off Oliver Queen and even later brought him back.  The true weakness of Superman is shown, (not Kryptonite or magic) but a personality flaw.

5379308,5,B00A2LFXVI,"Whenever something starts off as a beloved graphic novel or comic book series; there are always troubles in adapting it to visual media.  Less so for animation then live acting, but still, most of these are 75 minute condensed versions of the former.  What strikes me, is that these versions use the visual media to convey some of the books better moments, they tend to stay faithful to the original artists and mood.

Hey, we learned from the ""WATCHMEN"" that some adaptations can't be too accurate and exact.  Some editing and less soliloquy are necessary.  Comics lead but don't do so heavy handed-they allow the reader to fill in the gaps.  Video can't quite do that, but they can pack the scene with visual cues and action - requiring you to rewatch it to see and understand everything going on.  In live action - the ""Lord of the Rings"" series comes to mind, in Animation, these DC Graphic Adaptations have been filling that niche.

I guess the best thing to say is DC does get this part right.  Animation has been DC's best media to advance their products.",1361750400,,1062,4.6063829787234045

5379319,4,B00A2LFXVI,"Key animations, well done, action sequences most seemed to do justice to the book(s)

Background, all the super hero's made an ""agreement"" to retire, most left or went home, Batman reluctantly ""retires"" and that doesn't sit at all well with him.  Though he manages to sit through a good 10 years of that (according to the book, movie and the little previewy bits that I've seen about).

In this, the second (final - books 3 and 4 of a 4 book set) part of the translation of Dark Knight returns series, the Batman is torquing off everyone with his ""antics"".

Ronald Reagan (or a lookalike) is still in office and has a superhero as his lapdog.  Eventually leading to an explosive confrontation.

I'd say more on this, but I know that when I read the initial books, this whole lead up to the confrontation and the confrontation itself was (at the time) an amazing thing and brought quite a chuckle from me.  So, don't want to spoil it, other than to say, the fight alone is worth the price of admission.

That said... Anything outside of the key action, background buildings, anonymous cars, crowds, are at best animation fluff and sometimes you'd think ""Hmmmm, maybe a blank screen would have been better""....  Way to much crappy looking non-descript filler that brings the overall quality down a notch.

Is it true to the book(s)?  Honestly I can't say, it's been so many years since I've read them.

I will say there are a couple of scenes, hero recovering from a major energy expenditure that you'll look at and say ""whut?""

So, see this if you will, I enjoyed it, but DEFINITELY recommend reading the books first.

A lot of Frank Miller's book is the hero talking out issues to themselves and backfilling information that is helpful in understanding what is going on...  The movie winds up stripping all that for the most part.

You won't get lost, but you will get a skosh confused.

Oh yeah, you also get a good hour or so of additional material;  Talks of hero's, villains, and some of the thinking behind the scenes that were filmed.  Nice information, though Grant Morrison... and I love the guy's stuff... well, he should be english subtitled because I for one couldn't tell what he was saying half the time.  (Sorry Grant)

On a different note though, I did somewhat enjoy the final confrontation with the joker, though did not approve of the voice actor they chose for him (spoiled by Mark Hamill I suppose), and I found myself a little disappointed at the plot hole involving him going on television as rehabilitated, but them letting him don the makeup, which seemed..foolish.

5379333,5,B00A2LFXVI,"Bruce Wayne spent ten years looking for a good death.

We're at the conclusion of the Dark Knight's career, Dark Knight Returns (part 2), the adaptation of the critically acclaimed graphic novel by Frank Miller. It's the tale fan have been begging to see on screen, and in a lot of ways, the root of the modern version of Batman.

Before Christopher Nolan.

Before Bruce Timm.

Before Tim Burton.

The was only Frank Miller's Batman: The Dark Knight Returns. It ignited imaginations like an atom bomb, and nothing would ever be the same after the firestorm had passed.

There will be no more spoilers, except to expect more of the same vicious storytelling that characterized the first half of this adaptation, and to look forward to the stakes to get even higher.

The movie does have the same flaw as the first half, the narration from the book is missing. The narration in the book takes the action to a different level. But, on the other hand, they chose to keep the action scenes quiet, which I think is also true to the spirit of the original story. In the book, you spend a lot of time inside Batman's head, but he doesn't speak much.

What the filmmakers accomplished is to push the narration out of the way of the action. The book uses narration to establish that Batman is two steps ahead of everybody. But, Batman's moves are so smooth in this film, you can see and feel that Batman is two steps ahead of everybody, without him having to narrate it to you. And that's the reason I'm giving this a Five.

When I reviewed Batman: Year One, I gave it a Four because despite being a nearly flawless adaptation, the source material had been copied so many times it no longer had the same sting. But, to it's benefit, no one has copied The Dark Knight Returns. It's just too hot for TV, and way to complicated for a normal movie. It still stings, and bites, and claws, and rips. Especially if you look at both halves together, it's a big lumbering wall of muscle under the cape and cowl. I don't think it could get any better.

Special Features on the Blu-Ray include:

From Sketch to Screen: Exploring the Adaptation Process with Jay Oliva. Kinda like commentary, but over the animatic, only pieces of the film.

Superman vs. Batman: When Heroes Collide - A 9-minute feature talking about both characters.

The Joker: Laughing in the Face of Death - A 14-minute study of the Joker.

Preview of Superman: Unbound, the next direct to video movie. It's under the Trailers section. It's mostly behind the scenes stuff, you can find the real trailer for Superman Unbound on youtube, and it looks great.

Three Batman cartoons: ""The Last Laugh"" and ""The Man Who Killed Batman"" from Batman the Animated Series, and ""Battle of the Super Heroes"" from Batman: the Brave and the Bold.

A digital comic and other trailers pad out the disk.

While I do miss the narration, I think, overall, the two films work. It's not perfect enough to replace the original graphic novel, it's a good adaptation that I am happy to have. I give if a 5-out-of-5.",1361059200,,3038,4.565377532228361

5379335,3,B00A2LFXVI,"Batman has been represented in animation probably more than any other comic figure.  And that, unfortunately, works against Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2.  Let's start with the animation.  Proportionally, it simply doesn't look right.  Batman/Bruce Wayne is drawn as a hulking brute, all the while he's being depicted in his elder years (60+?).  The face is too large, the chest is bloated, it just doesn't look ""right"".  Peter Weller does admirable work as the voice of Batman, but for anyone who's watched any of the other incarnations, the cadence and deep tones are just ""off"".  All in all, the animation is first rate.  But these are nitpicky things compared to the chasms that are plot holes and mis-characterization.  Batman uses a gun...WTF?  Joker is boiled down to nothing more than a rampaging maniac with a gun, killing without any of the panache that the character is known for.  The GCPD couldn't hit water if they fell out of a boat (even my 11 year old son kept commenting that they couldn't hit the broad side of a barn time and time again).  Superman becomes what is essentially one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse (blight) and that plot point is never even discussed.  Oh, and the worlds most infamouse homocidal maniac is booked on a ""Dave Letterman-like"" TV show without any fear or protection.  Yeah, thats gonna happen.

All in all, the story is entertaining enough, Part 1 of this 2 part DVD set really isn't REQUIRED to enjoy part 2 (but it helps understand why Robin is a girl).  But I never felt like I was watching a Batman animated feature that featured the Batman that I've read for 30 years and watched in B:TAS, Justice League, or even Batman: TBTB.  Which is why I can't give this anything more than 3 out of 5 stars.",1361059200,,1766,4.645161290322581

And don't get me started on the new Robin.  Carrie Kelly rocks!  The voice work was excellent (this was the 1st time I didn't actively miss Conroy's voice)!

5379340,3,B00A2LFXVI,"An animated work that carefully follows a pictoral storytelling masterpiece has a pre-advantage.  And therein lies a problem: the original was writtin in the 80's for an audience in the 80s.  That's not a flaw, that's a statement of fact.  That the book is considered a classic with its thirty year old setting is a feature not a bug; it is a testament to its originality at the time.  Transfering the story to a later era, while leaving to much of the older era in place (or without a sufficient storytelling explanation in Part 1 that this version takes place in the eighties as well) suggests a lack of either convictional courage or honest creativity.  This was not a problem in Part 1.  It seems to be a problem in Part 2.  The most jarring example of this was keeping Reagan as the president in this version.  Substituting the current president into the story would've given the writers a change to show their courage and creativity.  Batman's liberterian streak as presented in the animated retelling would be more at odds with the current president than the one at the time the book was written.  Also, current events with Russia and/or other developing nuclear powers would not have constrained the nuclear problem tot he Soviet Union.

We also have a few minor applause and boos.  Regarding the voice talent, casting Conan O'Brien as the David Letterman type was pretty slick.  Bravo, Ms. Romano.  We're a tad disappointed some more recognizable names weren't in the rest of the cast (as was done in, say Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths).  Animation design of Batman was a good recreation of the original, but making Jim Gordon look hautingly Japanese was not.

5379352,4,B00A2LFXVI,"Adaptations of beloved books are hit and miss most of the time. Many people would say more miss than hit. DC Comics has again dodged what could've been a fatal bullet with ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2."" What fans get is a faithful animated feature that captures the spirit of Frank Miller and Klaus Janson's critically acclaimed graphic novel.

There's no break for the Dark Knight (Peter Weller) after his defeat of the Mutant leader. Batman is immediately thrown in to a battle with two of his biggest opponents: the Joker (Michael Emerson) and Superman (Mark Valley). The Joker has once again escaped imprisonment and is more obsessed with destroying Gotham City than ever before.

At the same time, the Man of Steel has been commissioned by the President of the United States (looking a lot like Ronald Reagan) to put an end to the Caped Crusader's vigilantism. Things get even more complicated when a nuclear missile combined with an EMP detonates and everything electrical shorts out. There are riots in the streets of Gotham and it looks like anarchy may reign supreme. Can Batman and his new army of Batmen get things under control before the city annihilates itself? Can the Dark Knight hold his own in a battle against the Last Son of Krypton?

Director Jay Oliva does a standup job of combining Bob Goodman's script and Andrea Romano's casting choices to come up with an action-packed and emotional film that perfectly captures Books Three and Four of Frank Miller's legendary work. There are many parts of this adaptation that follows the novel right down to the printed panel.

I'm not saying the animation matches the book to the tee. If that was the case, we might as well just have a motion comic. However, it certainly comes as close as possible without being a carbon copy.

I have to hand it to voice director Andrea Romano. She did an excellent job coming up with a top-notch cast for ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2."" Peter Weller is superb as an older and angrier Batman / Bruce Wayne. Both Michael Emerson and David Selby give their characters of the Joker and Commissioner Gordon unique flavors we haven't heard before. Emerson does come dangerously close to impersonating Jack Nicholson in some spots, though.

The high-definition audio and video quality of ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2"" could be better. The 5.1 surround sound perfectly distributes the explosions, dialogue, and musical score to the far reaches of your home theater. However, there's quite a bit of horizontal banding to be found in the picture. There's also a strange haze over the animation that I've noticed I get with all DC Universe Animated Movies. It's a bit distracting, but doesn't keep me from enjoying the films ultimately.

The Blu-ray edition of ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2"" is loaded with some exciting bonus material. Three featurettes entitled ""From Sketch to Screen: Exploring the Adaptation Process,"" ""Superman vs. Batman: When Heroes Collide,"" and ""The Joker: Laughing in the Face of Death"" go behind-the-scenes of the movie and explore the making of the film.

Three additional episodes from the DC Vault featuring the Dark Knight are included as well. They are from ""Batman: The Animated Series"" and ""Batman: The Brave and the Bold."" We get extended previews of DC Universe's next animated project, ""Superman: Unbound,"" and ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1."" It also contains a 4-page excerpt from the graphic novel ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns.""

The Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy version of ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2"" will please fans of the Caped Crusader on all levels. The feature film is an energetic and faithful adaptation of what is considered one of the greatest Batman graphic novels ever written. An abundance of special features gives it greater worth for consumers choosing between which format to buy. I close my review with one question: ""Are we ever going to see an animated feature film for 'The Dark Knight Strikes Again?'"" Feel free to argue amongst yourselves, comic book geeks of all genders.

5379353,5,B00A2LFXVI,This is the best Batman story I have seen to date. I love how they stuck to the books for the most part and that really captured the feel that Miller was going for.,1360627200,,164,3.8529411764705883
5379354,5,B00A2LFXVI,"When I first heard that DC Animation was going to be doing what is, in essence, a feature-length animated film out of Frank Miller's historic DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, I was a skeptic. After seeing what Warner Premiere and DC Animation did with Miller's arguably better work BATMAN: YEAR ONE (while being good, it is far from being where it needed to be, quality-wise), I was scared that they would excise too many of the great moments of social satire or cartoon down the violence so that it might be more palatable for a bigger audience.

Thankfully, under the perhaps more watchful eyes of director Jay Oliva and DC Animated's mastermind Bruce Timm, both Part 1 and Part 2 of THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS are very successful at bringing the comic to animated life. However, Part 2 proved to be even more successful and dynamic of an adaptation than Part 1.

The film (as far as both parts are concerned) does benefit making a pretty clear delineation of chapter breaks in connection to its source material. The comic, in its original form, had four issues. Part 1 of TDKR has the first two; entitled ""The Dark Knight Returns"", showing the aged Bruce Wayne (voiced by Peter Weller) assuming the identity of Batman after a ten-year absence amongst the menace of a gang of sociopathic punks called The Mutants, and ""The Dark Knight Triumphant"", which shows Batman gaining a new Robin in young Carrie Kelley (voiced by Ariel Winter) and the defeat of the Mutant's leader.

No matter how great those stories may be, it's all still a warm-up for Part 2, which has the real meat of the story as Batman must eventually confront The Joker (voiced by Michael Emerson), who has himself emerged from a 10-year catatonia simply as a response to Batman's return, and also, branded a public menace, he is facing arrest from Gotham City's new police commissioner Ellen Yindel (voiced by Maria Canals, best known to DC Animated fans as the voice of Hawkgirl in the JUSTICE LEAGUE cartoons) since Jim Gordon (voiced by David Selby) reached his mandatory retirement. And then, amidst an ever-changing and volatile political climate, Batman is put directly into the crosshairs of the President, who unleashes Batman's longtime frenemy Superman (voiced by Mark Valley) which will seal Batman's fate and the fate of Gotham City.

As with Part 1, the animation is done wonderfully, and has enough of Miller's giant physiques and Lynn Varley's darker coloring to give moments that seem to be lifted right off the page. But the voice of Peter Weller is still a bit of a problem. I felt that he would be perfect to cast as the older Batman/Bruce Wayne, but unfortunately, while not being monotone, there isn't enough emotion behind his voice during really any moment that gives any kind of indication that he feels one way or the other about the events at hand other than through dialogue. Although, it's the presence of Michael Emerson (best known as Benjamin Linus on LOST, or Harold Finch on PERSON OF INTEREST) as the voice of The Joker that ends up more than making up for any lack of passion. His Joker is so incredibly smarmy, viciously cruel, and more than a little love-struck. His personification of The Joker is that of less of a maniacal clown and more of a devilish seducer, waiting for the only person he's ever loved. It's here where one of the major points of Miller's work is seized brilliantly. Conceived not only as a story of Batman's older years, THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS is also a deconstruction of the characters portrayed within. The Joker exists because of Batman, and vice versa. They have a symbiotic relationship that far surpasses that of a superhero/supervillain conflict. They are almost interdependent upon each other, which is why The Joker is unable to kill Batman and why Batman, despite the sentiment he feels that he's murdered all of The Joker's victims himself, is also unable to end the omnipresent threat of The Joker with any real finality. Their final confrontation is brutal, extremely violent, and extremely unsettling.

The finale of the piece comes from a number of angles. A small Latin American country called Corto Maltese is being invaded by Soviet forces (bear in mind, this film takes place at the time that the comic was written in 1986), and while Superman helps to turn the tide of that conflict, the Soviets retaliate with an experimental nuclear weapon that has catastrophic effects for the United States. Gotham City needs a savior, and despite his injuries and being hunted by the law, Batman steps up to lead the city in saving itself. This leads in turn to the climactic confrontation between Batman and Superman. While the fight in the comic does hit the right moments, it's rather brief, and that is certainly not the case in this film. The epic battle between these two titans is extended to give a greater strength, a more visceral thrill, and perhaps even a more emotional punch than what was in the comic. It's by far the highlight of the film from every standpoint. The voice acting from Weller coalesces, and the animation of the fight in all of its superpowered glory is breathtaking. What really makes this scene work, though, is the incredible score provided by Christopher Drake, who has provided the score for just about all of the DC Animated films, and this is by far his most memorable and best work for this company.

As I stated in my review for the first of these two animated films, to adapt a work of such depth, nuance, and bravura was something I felt was an impossible task. And while THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS may not give the audience maybe everything it wants from the comic, it gives more than we would have expected, and in some cases, even enhances moments from the original material. This is a bold and mostly excellent adaptation of Miller's seminal work, and deserves to be counted amongst DC Animated's best work, particularly for Part 2. I couldn't really recommend this more highly.

As far as extras for the Blu-Ray release of this, it contains two segments regarding the characters; one about the history and rivalry between Batman and Superman and another more about the beginnings and the pathology of The Joker. These segments prove to be extremely well done with a cast of great talking heads such as Denny O'Neil, Grant Morrison, Jerry Robinson (who co-created The Joker), and Michael Uslan, who has been an executive producer of virtually every Batman film or television project since Tim Burton's 1989 film. It also includes a lengthy ""From Storyboard to Screen"" segment with commentary by Oliva, three episodes of Batman cartoons (two from the original 1990's animated series and one from the more recent BRAVE AND THE BOLD series) and a brief glimpse at a digital comic version of Miller's source material.

All in all, THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS PART 2 is a great release and extremely worthy of any Batman fan's film collection.

Even with the fact it's the second part, the story can stand alone, but is even better with the first installment.

This is Batman at the peak of his legend. Ending the joker and beating the son of krypton to certain death. Epic fights longed to be met with motion. The cherry on-top: I have a 1993 Robocop that has a talking function with the voice of Peter Weller telling me ""Don't do Drugs"" and now when I watch DKR and close my eyes it's like listening to Robocop. Missed Kevin, but Peter was awesome. B-""This ends now....All the people I killed by letting you live"". J-""I never kept count!"".B-""I Did!"".J-""And I love you for it!"".LOL",1360540800,,571,4.5

Please come back Mark Hamill The Joker needs you, the guy doing his voice in this film is not as twisted as his character is, he sounds like a very proper acting homosexual, and to me really takes away from his crazy killing ways in this film. John Dimaggio did a great job in Under the Redhood, should of at least got him back. Anyway enough of that this movie is still a 10 out of 10 really amazing check it out.

5379376,4,B00A2LFXVI,"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2 tells the story of how Bruce Wayne must confront the Joker, save Gotham City and go toe to toe with the Man of Steel. It's a great plot with twists and turns, good voice acting and superb orchestra. Some parts of the movie made me scratch my head.
Is it me or does Batman as the years go on become more stiffer and emotionless. (Huge spoiler alert) Alfred dies at the end, do we see any sympathy from Bruce Wayne.
In this movie, Superman is portrayed as an obedient dog, doing anything the President asks him to do. No questions are asked just done. Is this really Superman?! President says go stop the terrorist attacks, Superman says okay. It's hilarious. (Minor Spoiler Alert) Superman throws the nuke in space thus saving the day. The bomb detonates with Superman in the middle of it. Then Superman becomes a gaunt figure, falls to the Earth, then soaks the energy from the planet, and becomes normal again. That looked really cool, but what just happened?
Joker is a twisted, psychotic individual. In most of scenes we just see Joker killing people for no reason. In the scene where Joker enters the love triangle, he just shoots everyone. There are more creative ways of showing the dark side of Joker without having to be a mindless killing machine. One other scene was when Joker was battling Batman, he almost killed him, but the man of steel couldn't.
In the end it's a cool movie with some minor flaws.",1360022400,,1453,4.57088122605364

5379380,5,B00A2LFXVI,"A great story like Dark Knight Returns gets a two-part treatment, and just like Part 1, Part 2 is just as great to watch, even with some parts that got cut out of the adaptation (like Joker's ""kiss of death"" with the Dr. Ruth Westeinheimer expy). Again Peter Weller voices the older Batman, and I'm surprised to notice Justice League's Maria Canals voicing his pursuant Commissioner Ellen Yindel, who at first sees Batman as a menace but then realizes her predecessor Jim Gordon's words, that he's just ""too big"". Superman comes into the picture to try reining Batman back into silent compliance with the government, but that doesn't go over too well for a man who best works in the shadows and tries to avoid being front-page news even as the press still continues to report his activities. And of course, the Joker comes out of retirement for one last go-round with the Dark Knight, seeing how far he will push his nemesis to ultimately killing him.

As with Part 1, the animation and artwork is excellent, as a sort of mix between the original comic book style and Superman/Batman: Public Enemies. It's definitely worth a purchase if you're into Batman.",1360022400,6,1156,4.751243781094527

The animation is top notch, you will easily recognize the characters and even shot for shot recreations from the book.  The voice acting is done well and even though I have my favorite Batman voice actors, the people who acted this are awesome.

I haven't gotten to watch much of the special features on this movie yet, but I did go through them and it seems like you're getting quite a few extras and other tidbits.  I was impressed with what the first movie had with it, especially for the price, so I don't think you'll be disappointed.

While I did not see the first part I did watch this second part. The reason this video is not kid friendly, besides the obvious violence (more extreme than usual), is because of the language. In the opening scene and the first line a character takes the Lord's name in vein. Additionally, there are a few more foul words sprinkled throughout the video. A ""B"" word being one of the more memorable.

The story is quite strong and artwork are strong enough. There is no need for the distasteful shock value of curse words. In fact, they seem quite out of place. It seems like an agenda to desensitize a younger audience to such language. The profanity actually takes away from the story by serving to focus the viewer's attention on that word rather than the plot.

5379400,3,B00A2LFXVI,"I wanted to like this and the previous Part 1.  Really, I did.  I've been re-reading the graphic novel every few years since it came out in 1986, and I hear the dialogue in my head as I get to each panel.  When DC released the direct-to-video version, I had high hopes for how they'd translate it to the screen, and looked forward to seeing it animated.

It's not bad, certainly.  They did a fair job, but there were two gaping holes in my opinion.  First, the creators of the movies did away with the internal monologue that was the real treat.  What set TDKR apart from the rest of the comics at the time was the inside look at what's going on in Bruce Wayne/Batman's head.  You followed along with his thought process as he looked at the world as it had become, and it was the combination of the story being told (which was fairly well represented in the movie) with the monologue that provided the glue that held it together.  His running internal commentary as he chases the Joker through the Tunnel of Love.  His internal commentary as he beat the snot out of Superman.  The creators have taken some of that internal monologue and turned it into dialogue, but it's just not the same.  I expected to hear the monologue as part of the soundtrack to the action, and the lack of that monologue reduced the film to merely an animated version of the action on the panels, not what the story was about.

Secondly, I'm afraid I've been spoiled by other voice actors.  Ever since Batman: TAS came out, I hear Kevin Conroy's voice in my head when I read something thought or said by the character.  It was certainly interesting to hear Peter Weller's voice bring some Robocop-like nuances to the role, but Weller's voice fell short.  This was especially apparent in the scenes where Batman rode into Gotham during the blackout to restore order.  I expected a deep, resonant, commanding voice to issue forth and captivate the Sons of the Batman...and instead Weller's voice couldn't provide that, and sounded high and flat.  He might have coasted when delivering conversational dialogue, but not when it needed weight, strength, and command for that scene.  To add insult to injury, Batman is supposed to be about 55, right?  Kevin Conroy would have been 56 when this was recorded.  Think about how great that could have sounded.  I don't hold the creators to blame, as I'm sure they have to diversify the voice talent across the direct-to-video releases, but someone should have earmarked Conroy for this story.

Two nits.  First, the pacing seemed off.  Perhaps it's because I read it the graphic novel for years at my own pace, and inserted my own sense of timing, but I felt that Part 2, in particular, was rushed.  Some scenes felt like they were picking up too quickly without the sense that enough time had passed.  I might have been able to write this complaint off if the movie was released as a single disc, but if you're going to ask me to pay twice for two movies, the least you can do is pace it.  Not that I'm bitter.

The second nit: the death of the Joker.....they changed how it happened, and again, missed out on representing an important part of the Batman character, still not able to take a life at the very end.  It was a wasted opportunity, and I don't see why they couldn't include that.  It's as if the subtlety was lost on the writer....although this point wasn't that subtle.

I'll give the creators some credit, though.  The design and animation was fairly respectful to the original graphic novel art, with some updates, so I felt like I was watching a fair adaptation of the graphic novel.  Also, getting Conan O'Brien to voice the talk show host David Endochrine?  Amusing, appropriate, and ironic, all at the same time.  Well done.

In the end, I'll give it only 3 stars.  I was happy to see them include it in their slate of direct-to-DVD movies, and it was an interesting movie to watch, but I think I'll get more enjoyment out of the TAS episodes they bundled with the package than a repeat watching of the movie.  Fortunately, I still have the original graphic novel to re-read.",1359763200,21,4109,4.569083447332422

Although the initial series was released in the 80s DC Comics did a superb job with the film adaptation. This film alongside the first one is definitely living proof the Batman is the greatest superhero. If you were a fan of Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy than you don't want to miss this follow up to Dark Knight Returns. Part 2 has an amazing story, the perfect ending and this film is so strong it could be easily mistaken as a cartoon that should have been a live action film. When watching these two films together it makes one wonder is it possible for DC Comics to outdue themselves with the Batman. It will definitely rank as one of the top Batman films of all time (and not as just animated films but top Batman films of all including the live action films) They definitely do the batman justice in this film and maybe someday we'll get the origin stories of Joker (Killing Joke) and Bane.",1359763200,,975,4.362637362637362
5379404,2,B00A2LFXVI,"The Joker, a known psychopath and serial killer, is allowed on the set of a talk show, with no security inside. He has always used makeup to kill people and guess what- He brought his own! The ""suspension of reality"", necessary in all sic-fi and fantasy, is simply over the top and rates right up there with the ability of Hobbits to knock down Uruachi warriors with a few pebbles. (and before you say it- David had a slingshot!)
The psychiatrist is as shallow of an idiot as you will ever see- absolutely predictable and just plain silly- poorly written.
 One of the best things about the movies and other Batman titles is how the secondary characters are better developed- The more believable they are, the more ""real""they are- the better the story. Are there really any ""layers"" of storytelling here? (Rhetorical question- answer is ""no""). The new police commissioner is angry and predictably angry. Yes, she stands in contrast to Gordon- but that makes her shallow.
One final point- I'm generally conservative in my politics although NOT Republican (""the stupid party""). Despite this, I do not like the attitude of disrespect toward President Obama- I disagree with him on a number of issues, but I respect the office. Be mature and even gracious when voicing those disagreements... soooooo, what do you think about the writer's portrayal of former President Ronald Reagen?  When the writers decided to ""take their shots"" at him, they let us know beyond any doubt how they feel. Go back and look at how he was drawn. Look at his dialogue. This reveals a level of immaturity that all of us can fall prey to. Simply put: ""Show some respect"". Beyond the politics, a storyline is almost always disrupted when a writer has a clear agenda. When you dislike Reagan so much, it just bleeds through the script and the artwork. I didn't vote for president Obama, but I hate to see cartoon drawings of him with huge ears and a dopey look on his face. It goes both ways, and when you do this, you receive praise- but only from those that agree with you- all others simply tune you out and turn you off. It never leads to real change; besides, I bought this movie for Batman, not for a political viewpoint.

I've read the source material several times and always wished I could see the biggest fight of all played out on the screen. This film doesn't disappoint in the slightest, Peter Weller once again nails it as batman. The comic book was written in the 80s and this shows in key scenes, Reagan is president and the soviets are still around terrorizing the rest of the world, so keep that in mind as you watch this. The dark knight returns is the comic book that's responsible for the batman we have today, it brings a gritty and angry batman to the forefront. The fight is actually better than I always imagined it would be, and as far as I'm concerned the question of who would win was answered with this movie.

5379408,5,B00A2LFXVI,"Back in late September I got my hands on the first part of this two film DCAU project. I had nothing but good things to say after seeing just how close to the original source 'The Dark Knight Returns Pt. 1' was. Patience has definitely been a virtue because 'The Dark Knight Returns Pt. 2' is amazing.

All I could say was 'they did it' while they did change a few things around for the purpose of cinematic value, they did not hold anything back with transitioning the final two parts from page to film. The final battle between Batman & The Joker is not a child friendly fight. The film captures all the intensity and violence and with a brilliant choosing of Michael Emerson to voice the Clown Prince, I was left speechless. Of course the final part has a true clash of the titans with The Dark Knight against The Man of Steel. Still, with a fight that is stand still on the pages of the book the film fills in the gaps between frames adding more to the fight and making it so much more dramatic and such a great scene. The voice cast is great, the story is great and now that all 4 parts of this landmark story are now on DVD & Blu Ray it is a must see for DC comic readers, DCAU fans but more importantly those who are true film and animation appreciators.

The only thing that upset me was, this two part film was big screen worthy. Even though, Bruce Timm tried that back in 1993 with 'Batman: Mask of the Phantasm' 'The Dark Knight Returns Parts 1 & 2' would have been an excellent comeback. The fans were so ready and I would have been in the front row.

This project is now a major mark in the DCAU film library, I am wondering where it will go and what stories we will see. What I am truly hoping for is a possibility of more of these 2 part projects, because there are so many more amazing stories to tell.

5379412,5,B00A2LFXVI,"** This review has many spoilers **
These 2 movies are a terrific adaptation that are true to Frank Miller/Klaus Janson's 1986 landmark story which along with the Watchmen invented the concept of comic book graphic novel. The Dark Knight Returns remains one of the greatest graphic novels of all time and I still remember picking up the 4 issues of the story back in 1986, not realizing the significance of what I was reading. So the makers of these movies had a lot to live up to when they decided to adapt the graphic novel into a movie. Firstly it was a very wise decision to split the story into 2 parts, too much story to cram into a single movie. The animation is first rate, clean lines, colours that capture the dark mood of a Gotham descended into a cesspool of crime and violence. The nuclear winter environment was really well drawn. And I'm glad the violence wasn't overly sanitized, there's lots of blood letting and brutality which did not feel gratuitous at all. Joker's murderous rampage from the methodically planned talk show audience massacare to his indiscriminate murdering at the fair grounds - how awesome was it to see him politely apologizing to the people in his path through the Tunnel of Love as he executed them one by one. And those creepy flying Bobbie and Mary poison gas spewing exploding robot dolls were sublime. And I was pleased they didn't overly sanitize the brutal fem-nazi Bruno character over allowing her to be topless with the memorable swastikas painted over her breasts (Although no view of her naked asscheeks like in the graphic novel).

The pacing was excellent. The dialog crisp. The score was perfect, fitting and not overwhelming.

The voice acting I'm split over. Having watched/listened to Kevin Conroy portray Batman for 2 decades it's hard to imagine anyone else who could do the voice of Batman. Similarly Mark Hamill did such a fantastic job as Joker for years I found the Mark Emerson's voice of Joker in this movie a bit too smooth and not maniacal enough. On the other hand I thought Mark Valley's voice of Superman/Clark's voice was a good fit right up there with George Newbury and Tim Daly who have done most of the voice of Superman in recent times. Ariel Winter was very good as Robin. Nice to see Justice League regular Maria Canals (Hawkgirl) with a prominent role. And always cool to see how producer Bruce Timm inserts himself into a minor character role and last but not least Michael McKean (remember Lenny and Squiggy?) as Dr Wolper and Conan O'Brien as Dave Endrochine were nice touches.

And nice touches re-creating several iconic images from the graphic novel: The silhouette of Batman in mid air with the lightning bolt backdrop. Clark standing in the grassy field with the open shirt and one foot on a rock. A stabbed and bleeding Batman sitting next to a smiling, neck snapped dead Joker in the tunnel of love. Superman emaciated in the middle of the nuclear blast with the lightning bolt through his body. Superman plastered on the nose top of the huge Soviet nuclear missle in mid flight. Bruce pulling the drapes aside finding a beaten, bound Selina Kyle hog tied wearing a Wonder Woman costume.

Kudos to Bruce Timm and director Jay Oliva for this fantastic product and hopefully more of these DC Animated Universe movies to come. Just sticking to Batman alone there's so much material ... Long Halloween, Hush, Knightfall to name a few.

Now that I've watched this film adaptation it's time to re-read the graphic novel again!",1359676800,4,3511,4.739770867430442
5379413,5,B00A2LFXVI,"After watching the first part, I was captivated and fortunately enough I saw that feature the night of Part 2's release, not knowing that part 2 was out as of that day. I immediately watched the second installment and here are my thoughts:

Pros:

-It truly is a spectacle to see Frank Miller's work come to life and hold so true.

-The voice acting is some of the best that I have heard for DC/Batman animated works and Bruce's voice felt right given his older stature.

-Really blown away by the Joker's animation and shocked (in a good manner) that the animated film did not hold back on how violent his persona is and how Frank Miller portrayed him.

-If you have not read Miller's work, you don't need to in order to enjoy these films to a high extent.

-I believe this work is one of the best since Mask of the Phantasm meaning that I could definitely see myself re-watching this over and over again in both the near and distant future. That sort of plays into solidifying Batman into [more of] a legend [than before].

Cons:

-Not for the faint of heart. This animated feature will become violent and there are scenes that highlight this in particular so I advise not watching this with kids.

[note: this film was not necessarily made to appeal to a younger audience]

-Juxtaposing the film with Part 1, it felt less grounded in a more realistic world, sort of a Nolan-esque type of world for the Dark Knight live action films. However, this should not be held as a deterrent for those wondering if they should watch it. Simply put, you should take the time to watch it.

Overall, I recommend watching this film as well as looking to Miller's work. I must note that in his works that there is a subsequent series that ties in perfectly into the events of this Part 2 film that would lead you to believe that they will move forth with a Part 3.

5379415,5,B00A2LFXVI,"I read the Frank Miller graphic novel several years ago and, like many, was very impressed. The only criticism I had of that is the same one I have of this, which is the very ending. It still doesn't feel right.

WARNING! This is NOT for kids. This is a very violent and mature animated film, very dark and disturbing. Not a criticism, but for any parents thinking this is going to be like most superhero cartoons, you are in for a surprise.

This is part two of The Dark Knight Returns, but in itself is two films, or two stories.

The first story is about the Joker. It is creepy. It is very well done. Even though I knew what was going to happen, I was mesmerized. The Joker makes up for lost time and goes on an epic killing spree and this film pulls few punches. The final showdown between Batman and the Joker is appropriately toe to toe.

The second story is about Superman. This is even more epic. Superman is by this time simply a soldier following orders. He is told to fight the Russians. He does that in devastating fashion. He is eventually told to get Batman and put a stop to his brand of street justice.

This leads to the final showdown. It is more than worth the wait.

5379425,4,B00A2LFXVI,"I give it four stars largely because it does not tamper with Frank Miller's inspired story (this is easily tops the other two ie. Batman: Year One and Batman: TDKR Part 1). The animation was very slick, and they include just about all of the scenes from the very edgy story (including the opening scenes featuring the Joker's new female bodybuilder girlfriend ""Bruno""). The feature is not without its flaws however, particularly the surprisingly horrific voice acting. Peter Weller is beyond awful as Batman. He almost single handedly ruins the movie. He sounds more like Superman's crusty old curmudgeon of a boss at the Daily Planet, rather than an aging Dark Knight. His performance was downright jarring at times, particularly vis a vis the actor who voices Superman (who does a terrific job). Micheal Emerson's Joker is not nearly as bad, he just isn't that memorable, either. Another minor irritation is the voice actor who does Ronald Reagan -- it doesnt sound like the Gipper in the least. I do a better imitation -- or at least I did back in high school in the 1980s! Miller includes Reagan in this story because of the former President's remarkable duality -- the harmless old fuddy duddy charm with his incessant ""wells"" and references to his own wife as ""mommy"", masks a terribly strong, menacing and highly xenophobic character within (and a possibly a corrupt one). But the voice actor responsible for Reagan doesnt seem understand this, and so Reagan comes across as just another generic old white guy. So, yeah, apparently the legendary Andrea Romano, responsible for hiring voice actors for DC Films, is mortal after all. She totally drops the ball on this one.
The near catastrophic voice acting aside, I would still recommend at least a single viewing of this film, because the Miller story is that damn good.",1359417600,,1828,4.9

5379427,5,B00A2LFXVI,"After reading the graphic novel years ago, like many of you I was both excited and nervous to see how well it would translate over into a film.  Although I miss Bruce's internal monologues, this movie does fine to capture his ideas and methodology without a voice over.

Even though the comic's look and character design felt dated, it does add an extra depth and unique look throughout both films which further solidifies it as self contained within its' own universe.

After part 1 was concluded I remember thinking that part 2 felt like it wasn't coming out for a very long time... and now that part 2 has come and gone I wonder what we bat fans have to look forward to in terms of his next appearance?

5379428,1,B00A2LFXVI,"Yes, I watched and enjoyed Part I. No, I haven't read any of the graphic novels. Yes, I understand that this takes place in a parallel dimension. But still, watching this felt like a train wreck, from the first villain (a trope grab bag: swastika pastied neo natzi manwoman?) to the last huzzah (Batman, in his high-tech armor, riding through Gotham on a black stallion like something from a Jane Austen novel?). The concept of a future Earth where we're still in a cold war with soviet Russia, where certain superheros have sold themselves out to become the WMD for a corrupt and imbecilic American government, is a weird mishmash of different eras of real Earth history that does not appeal to me in the slightest. Jumping from bad guy to bad guy with no rhyme or reason is also annoying. The link between swastika pasty girl and Joker is weak at best, then there's no indication as to who the next antagonist really is. The new commissioner? The American government? Batman himself? The president's superhero lapdog? The Communists? The Mutants? The apathetic people of Gotham? Those weird flying doll things?

While the idea that Batman might be able to make Gotham City, the most corrupt and dangerous city in the world, a bastion of hope in a post-apocalyptic world, is an interesting one, it's not an idea that's very well explored. It's also muddled up in the other weak subplots: How far will an older, cynical Batman go for justice?; Will Robin be a successful successor to Batman?; Or, does the torch of Gotham justice get passed to the Sons of Batman?; What is the relationship between the new commissioner and Batman-style justice going to be?; How does the next generation of superhero justice operate, with the old big names retiring and the new organizations operating under Superman's shadow?

Part I leaves off with so much promise for Part II, but I spent the entire movie thinking, ""WTF?"" and waiting for a final closing thread that would pull it all together and give it some sense. Which never happend.

5379433,5,B00A2LFXVI,"Having been a fan of The Dark Knight Returns since it was first published 27 years ago, I've always known that any sort of animated film adaptation would be held under SERIOUS scrutiny, as well it should.  This is one of the greatest graphic novels ever published and, in order to do it justice, the attention to detail must be extraordinary.

If Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1 amazed you, Part 2 will blow your mind.

They gave it the treatment it really deserves and the results are spectacular.  It's faithful to Frank Miller's artistic style as well as the original storyline, with only minor changes to help it better fit the medium.  In fact, I was surprised at how faithful.  There were elements that I didn't expect to be there that were included and, dare I say it, they expanded upon certain elements, especially the fight scenes, that actually made them MORE EXCITING! Those kinds of things tell me that they REALLY did their best to make this what everyone wanted to see.

Part 1 was met with epic reviews and I believe that Part 2 deserves even MORE praise.  We get the exciting conclusion we've all been hoping for and it goes ABOVE and BEYOND expectations.

This 2-part collection is, without a doubt, the best animated feature I've seen in years and will, no doubt, be a fan favorite for many years to come.",1359331200,,1332,4.586497890295359

5379435,3,B00A2LFXVI,"My review title sounds like an oxymoron but that's my opinion. The movie feels slow at the start then rushed. There should have been more time for the consequences of batman's final round with the joker to set in but instead we quickly forget that for the next crisis. Also, they skipped so many classic lines from the book itself. Clearly I am disappointed. But yet I am satisfied. Why? Because the casting is great. Michael Emerson as the joker was not a move I initially looked forward too but he does great. He really brings the creepy, bisexual, sadistic joker of the comic to life. Peter Weller is also great (seriously, why are people hating on him?) and superman sounds like superman. Then there are the fight scenes. I complained about timing but the fight scenes are just amazing. I felt the tension in the fight between the joker and batman. I felt the excitement as DC's two biggest boys duke it out over Gotham. This movie has its faults but I did not mind spending $14.99.",1359158400,2,986,4.544943820224719

In dark times the sun doesn't shine, only the determination of one man can save more than a city from falling into total chaos. This stands out from the rest.

5379440,1,B00A2LFXVI,"This movie takes what was essentially a story boarded movie already - and messes it up. How do you do that? It was all there on the page for you.

Let's start with the voice talent - Peter Weller is terrible, phoning it in. Michael Emerson brings NOTHING, I repeat NOTHING to one of the juiciest, if not the juiciest animated roles in history.

Now let's go with the direction - it feel rushed, ham handed, amateur. The pace is off, we are never made to truly care about the main characters and the soundtrack is bland and unremarkable, if serviceable (sort of). There is no vision here yet this movie begged to be made by someone with a vision because it's based on a visionary work. Instead it's lifeless and predictable. In fact it's hard to sit through. I honestly couldn't be much more disappointed.

Where is the unique color scheme of the animated series? Where is the pop, the spark, the intensity to the performances? It's all missing. For my money almost any episode of Batman the Animated Series or any of the Justice Leagues has much more to say, more characterization and is more involving. I felt very separate from this movie. I had to invent ways to enjoy it.

If you saw this movie before you read the graphic novel it would hard for me to convince you to read it. This is a shame as it's a seminal work. It's the Ulysses of comic books - a game changer.

It is done a terrible disservice by this POS movie. Whoever is responsible for this should never be allowed to direct or produce anything animated again. This novel deserved a Bruce Timm, a Paul Dini, a Brad Bird even. Instead it's got the feel of a low budget cash-in by DC.

Shame shame shame shame shame. Lifeless, poor. Unwatchable in parts. Just really, really bad.",1358985600,7,1743,4.448275862068965
5379441,2,B00A2LFXVI,"Similar to other complaints, I found the voice acting, delivery, and direction was just terrible. It was so bad that it was actually distracting and made it very difficult to enjoy.  For me, this was much more noticeable with Part II than Part I.  I know that Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill are a tough act to follow, but surely they could have done a better job here.

5379453,3,B00A2LFXVI,"While this doesn't flinch in the face of Frank Miller's daring, classic source material, it manages to fail in other ways - some avoidable, others a helpless victim of the format. Readers concerned about potential scene-trimming or the censorship of important, risque spots in the graphic novel can rest easy. It's all here, from Reagan in a haz-mat suit to the Joker's talk show appearance, with only two notable alterations: the identity of the TV host (whose replacement is actually a great surprise) and the crash-landing location of a disabled aircraft (it falls on a crowded city street, rather than into a skyscraper). Otherwise, it's a raw, direct translation that's especially effective during the major action sets - the final battle between Batman and his lifelong rival is downright incredible. Where it falls short - infuriatingly, unforgivably, and universally - is in its voice acting. Never have I heard a more mundane, emotionless series of performances in a major production. It's flat from start to finish, robbing landmark scenes of their emotional power and eradicating the vigor that oozed from the printed page. Granted, much of Miller's dialog is Lucasian, in that it works far better in print than on the screen, but even a remotely talented cast should have been able to compensate for that with an appropriately passionate delivery. Instead, we get a wounded Joker asking Batman ""Are you out of your mind?"" in a dull, straight monotone, rather than the shocked, manic shriek I heard in my mind upon first turning that page. Perhaps I've been spoiled by so many years of classics from Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill, because, for me, there was just no looking past these performances. Which is a shame, because the animation is wonderfully fluid and appropriate, and the plot still remains startlingly timely. A painful wasted opportunity",1358380800,4,1862,5.088235294117647
5379454,5,B00A2LFXVI,"This is by far the best DC Animated Feature to date.

5379456,4,B00A2LFXVI,"I enjoyed the movie, but I thought it was very graphic in terms of violence. This must be a new direction for them because I never seen so much killing in these DC movies before. It so much darker now, where as before, when someone is about to die, they don't show it actually. Instead, what you see is zone out of the scene and come back to it after the death. They did do that a few times in the movie, but when I started to see the Joker killing bystanders out of the blue, I was like that's odd and sad. How did this thing manage a PG-13 rating? The rating people must be getting more lead way with violence now.",1358035200,,616,4.016260162601626

It's a great adaptation of the comic.
There was a well-told story about morality and authority.
The animation was great with a lot of attention to detail in the action sequences.
And the pacing was just perfect.  I was constantly engaged.

The only downside is a matter of preference.  The reason I preferred Part 1 is because there was less ""out there"" stuff going on.  I tend to like my Batman stories more grounded in reality and not flying gas dolls and men of steel.
I also find it odd that The Joker can almost kill Batman, but Superman doesn't even come close.

The writers added a very small dialogue between them that basically encapsulates their relationship with Bruce and Batman that isn't in the original comic and it brought a tear to my eye. Batman's relationship with Jim Gordon and Superman has always been my way into the Batman story. Such contrasts. And this line, holy crap. I wish Frank Miller would just add an extra panel in a reprinted version of the book with just that line in it. Amazing.

It's Dark Knight Returns. Its faithful to the comic. Therefore it is perfect. The BEST Batman film ever made. So much to love.
