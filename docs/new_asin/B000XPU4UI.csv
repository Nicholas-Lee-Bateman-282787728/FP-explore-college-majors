8228973,1,B000XPU4UI,"When I was in college, my roommates and I watched this movie.  I felt like we were the target audience for the movie- religious, romance lovers, lovers of the classics (which it was loosely based on).  One of my roommates was obsessed with cowboys and would only watch movies that were squeaky clean, super-G rated.  Like I said, target audience.  This movie was PAINFULLY cheesy and SO BORING and AWFUL.  Normally if a movie was dumb, my roommates and I could at least get enjoyment from laughing at the cheese.  But it was too bad for even the ""this is dumb and cheesy"" laughs.  I wish I could get the hours back I spent watching it (I don't remember how long it was, but it felt like it dragged on FOREVER).  There were four of us and we all hated it.",1382832000,,754,4.297872340425532
8228974,5,B000XPU4UI,"We loved this movie! So much humor with the cultural differences, the story line of falling in love and then ending up falling in love with someone else and what to do. Dealing with dishonest people and then how the truth is revealed. Great movie!!!",1381968000,,249,4.555555555555555
8228975,3,B000XPU4UI,"I have enjoyed better many other stories. I'm british, so the american produced story line was not convincing. I suggest the producer sticks to a USA storyline for future productions.",1360540800,,183,5.133333333333334

8228978,2,B000XPU4UI,"This movie looked interesting in spite of the ugly girls on the cover, and I must say I truly enjoyed it...because I had a good laugh!  The film is entirely cheezy and completely unbelievable, but I gave it two stars because it was very entertaining.  For example, the main character walks along the streets of London in a cowboy hat and spurs...and later ends up in jail under false accusation with a lunatic who he converts to the gospel.  And why is some cowboy from Montana even working in England with a bunch of high-class snobs?  I just don't get it.  The rundown is that this movie is called a romantic comedy, but I laughed in all the places that weren't meant to be humorous, as well as the ones that were.  The plot is interesting; the film is entertaining!- but this isn't one of those movies you want to watch again and again.  Suffice it to say that this is the worst LDS movie I have ever seen...even though the girls aren't as ugly in the film as they are on the cover.",1308614400,2,985,4.320652173913044
