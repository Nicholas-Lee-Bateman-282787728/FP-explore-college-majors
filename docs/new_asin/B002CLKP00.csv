3906721,2,B002CLKP00,"I bought this product because the premise sounded interesting. It still is and while the actors were good in their parts, in my opinion, with the exception of a few episodes, the series didn't live up to its potential. AND I hate shows that end a year with wait until next year before you can get closure. What happens if the show is cancelled?

I won't be watching season two. Season one didn't do enough for me to hold my interest.",1253145600,4,433,4.345679012345679
3906722,5,B002CLKP00,"I don't know if Sanctuary is coming back this year.  It was a quirky and great show to watch.  You didn't know what was coming each week from that fortress called the Sanctuary.  Amanda Tapping gives a stand out performance as the immortal leader of this menagerie of characters.  I was surprised she wasn't given the lead in the Stargate: Atlantis or Universe series.  It was good to see her in a role other than that of Samatha Carter.  The other characters also could use some fine tuning. However they are no better or worse than some of the lower end sci fi movies on the SyFy channel.  If you want to see a combination of Sci Fi/Horror and action, Sanctuary is worth your time.  Now if the channel does the right thing and keep this on the air, I'll be writing a review for season 2!",1251763200,3,789,4.319727891156463
3906723,1,B002CLKP00,"I looked forward to a new Sci-Fi series when I heard about this one.  But, like so many others, it was disappointing and unimpressive.

Upon watching the first episode, I got the vibe that this series is just like the BBC's Torchwood series.  Unlike Dr. Who, Sci-Fi has never re-ran Torchwood, so sci-fi followers only watching the sci-fi channel would have overlooked it.  The main points of similarity is that Torchwood is also a secret society lead by an immortal (in this case a man named Jack) and they also combat and protect aliens (not unlike the fantasy creatures in Sanctuary).  Torchwood also starts out with a new recruit coming aboard, just like Sanctuary.  As with Sanctuary's Helen, different people from Jack's past come back to haunt him, being immortal.

I also found the CGI and blue screen sets very cheap and cheesy.  They are not realistic at all.  I can see using a blue screen for scenes that are hard to film, but using a blue screen for underground tunnel scenes and interior scenes just doesn't look good.  You could obviously tell that the backgrounds were fake!

If you ask me, this show is just a re-working of Torchwood to fit the sci-fi's vision and give Amanda Tapping a new job.  It is completely emotionless and lacks any real human connections.",1251331200,24,1280,4.716216216216216
3906724,5,B002CLKP00,Damn good show. Amanda Tapping is a beautiful person and it shines through in everything she does. Watch and enjoy.,1249862400,5,115,4.8
3906725,5,B002CLKP00,This series is stunning and I will definitely buy it. But not yet. I will wait a little longer for a possible Blu Ray relase.,1248912000,4,125,4.04
3906726,3,B002CLKP00,"Imagine this: a giant gothic building that serves as a ""sanctuary"" to various strange, freakish and/or dangerous creatures that exist in the world.

That's the concept behind ""Sanctuary: The Complete First Season,"" a fantasy/sci-fi show that started off as a series of webisodes, then got turned into a show for the Sci Fi (Sy Fy?) Channel. The first season starts off shaky and sometimes painfully silly (nubbins!), but the second half suddenly smooths itself into a solid arc of secrets, conspiracies, and a fanatical enemy organization.

Forensic psychiatrist Will Zimmerman (Robin Dunne) has a pretty rotten life -- his girlfriend has left, his job is a joke, and nobody believes his deductions. But during a bizarre murder investigation, he encounters a strange woman named Helen Magnus (Amanda Tapping) who offers him a job at the Sanctuary.

The Sanctuary turns out to be a vast cathedral-like structure filled with ""Abnormals"" -- mermaids, elementals, iguana-men, two-faced dudes, or anything that doesn't fall in the boundaries of known science. But the Sanctuary's residents are now in danger from a charming Abnormal named John Druitt (Christopher Heyerdahl), who has a longtime connection to Helen. And unless he gets what he wants from her, he'll kill her daughter Ashley (Emilie Ullerup).

Other Sanctuary problems: a trio of amnesiac women who may be the Morrigan, a drug lord among the Folding Men, an autistic boy whose pictures reveal Abnormals, a Himalayan plane crash with a mind-altering monster, a brain parasite in the Bermuda Triangle that threatens to turn Magnus into a psycho killer, the superfertile Nubbins (like carnivorous Totoros), a man who looks suspiciously like Magnus' late father, and a pair of reporters who witness the Sanctuary team fighting rare killer insects. And John Druitt reappears to reveal that an old friend of Helen's has turned against her...

And the Sanctuary has a new enemy -- the fanatical Cabal, who want all Abnormals under their control. When they unleash a biological weapon that turns Abnormals into raving killers, Helen's old study group (""The Five"") must reunite to save the Abnormal population.

The first half of ""Sanctuary: The Complete First Season"" is a severely mixed bag -- most of it isn't really bad, but it's not terribly unique or gripping. And the ""nubbins"" (tribbles with teeth) episode is just embarrassingly silly. But with the introduction of Nicola Tesla (who is a vampire!), suddenly the entire series tightens up and becomes far more streamlined, complex and emotionally powerful.

Along the way, the writers fill the series with all sorts of freaky creatures (ranging from a Hulk-like supersoldier to a floating snake beastie), slimy body parts, and some gun-heavy action scenes. The writing is rather wobbly in the first half (""Women and geeks first... oh, no, that's all of us""), but the sci-fi edge gives it a quirky appeal (""I guess Ike didn't want to breathe the same air as the Nazi High Command."" ""Some of them didn't even breathe air"").

And ""Sanctuary"" has a pretty striking look -- half industrial science complex, and half Gothic decay, with vast cathedral-like buildings, grey cloudy skies, and the half-ruined Old City. Most of the backgrounds are CGI, which gives the series a smooth, stylized look.

Despite her awkward accent, Tapping is a powerful presence as the hyperintellectual, immortal Helen Magnus, and Dunne is brilliant from the start as the Daniel Jackson of the series (smart and geeky, with a tragic past). Ryan Robbins is great as the resident techno-superbrain, who is haunted by his own Abnormal secret, and Christopher Heyerdahl does a brilliant two-character turn -- he's the charming, smooth killer John Druitt, and he's also the shy but kindly butler Bigfoot.

The one false note is Ashley -- while Ullerup does a fair job, the character is an urban fantasy cliche -- cocky, gun-happy, and wears a leather catsuit during fights. But the supporting cast is pretty fascinating, especially since the writers start ushering in Victorian literary and historical figures.

""Sanctuary: The Complete First Season"" has some mighty wobbles in its first half, but the second half stabilizes and flowers like a black rose. Watch it, if nothing else to prepare for the second season.",1248739200,,4292,5.16115107913669
3906727,5,B002CLKP00,"I recently watched this entire series, and although the first few episodes start slow, the series is fantastic. The writers have created a show that combines science fiction with mild horror and amazing story telling that will not let you down. If you have only seen an episode, or even just part of an episode, take my advice and watch the series from the beginning. I had seen the show on a few times, but it failed to get my attention because I was wondering what the heck was going on. Sanctuary is the first sci-fi show in a while that I have been really happy watching. Now that I have seen the first season, I will most certainly be watching Season 2.

- Excellent story that combine myths and legends with our own world.
- Great cast of characters that you can relate to.
- Doesn't go overboard with stupendous plots.
- It's a combination of Science Fiction, Horror, and Drama.
- Contains just the right amount of comedy to give a few laughs.
- Some of the scenes are downright amazing.

Hope this review has been helpful, as I think a lot of people will love this show, but either don't know about it, or don't want to risk wasting their time.
I love it, and I think you will enjoy it as well!",1247270400,205,1202,4.314159292035399
3906728,5,B002CLKP00,"Let me preface this with the fact that getting me 'into' a new tv series is not easy, and add to that that I am not what I would call a sci fi/horror loyalist. I enjoy these genres, but I am not addicted to either one. What I like most is drama.

That stated, Sanctuary took me a couple of episodes to get hooked, but hooked I got. Not sure exactly what did it for me, but I believe it was that the show presents a very well honed mix of horror, sci fi, and investigative action. The balance is interesting, and just when you need a dose of one of the elements, you get it.

Blending the genres, to me, has resulted in a show that is full of surprises and full of fun, but also filled with drama (my fav). I would add to this that the special f/x are stupendous, especially for a tv series.",1246492800,49,790,3.9936708860759493

This is a great show to watch in the morning to start your day, while having breakfast, will leave you in a good mood to start your day.  If you are a fan of the Star Gate series, this is glorious transformation for Amanda Tapping, where she is still brilliant, strong, tough, yet compassionate, impassioned about her work, but in this series, I think you see more of the sexiness you always knew was their. Also fun, some of her Star Gate co-stars make some surprise appearances, as different characters, some as creatures.  Great Series, my only complaint is that it ended.  Amanda, if your listening please bring it back, or maybe do a Helen Magnus spin off, prequel or Tomb Raider or something. Love the show and the character.",1475712000,2,849,4.565789473684211

Too bad, I really liked the premises and the acting. Kind of like Heroes - where the writers totally dropped the Ball.
The whole thing was kind of like x-files meets twilight zone, only a lot better.
I liked it for a lot of reasons and am sorry they cancelled it.
Was also a fan of Star Trek Enterprise and still don't understand how THAT got cancelled. It just got better and better and it got cancelled.
I guess TV needs a certain sub-standard IQ to thrive!

3906858,4,B002CLKP00,"This was a blind buy from me but as a fan of Amanda Tapping, I bought it. The entire season looks and sounds fine on Blu-ray.
Its a low budget series and you can see the limitation's of the special effects, but its not so bad you'd complain about it. The stories themselves are fine, a couple of arcs begin and some end. The acting is good.
  This is a sci-fi series and its about unusual creatures/beings that are not able to survive in our world without causing some problems so hence, ""Sanctuary"", in some cases , prison. The series explains Amanda Tapping's characters role,(regarding the ""Sanctuary"") her past, the people she knew and still knows, historical characters who play a part in present day happenings. She also has a ""team"" who help her with aiding the creatures, catching them. She also of course has a nemesis.  It maybe a little convoluted in places, but I liked it overall. Worth watching.",1387065600,4,909,4.633540372670807

3906860,4,B002CLKP00,"Overall, a series that grows on  you, but don't expect Star Gate or Star Gate Atlantis. Some of the episodes are cheeseball in that they are just not believable due to physics mistakes, and some of them will make you laugh if you know anything about physics or kinetic energy, or science in general.

The last season is written the best and is the most believable.  When I say above that some of the episodes are physics wise unbelievable, what I mean isn't that there is advanced technology. There is no physics related problem with that idea, since those physical things haven't been invented. In that way, writers can take creative liberty, and rightly so.

The problem is when known physics is violated. I'll give you a good example using military hardware. We've all seen the shows where a soldier hides behind a brick wall, or even more egregious, a normal metal or wood structure, like a wooden table or the corner of a building, while bullets ricochet off harmlessly. In some instances, it can work, in others, it's just annoying to watch. Fifty caliber ammunition goes through brick and cinder-block. You need to be virtually in a tank to avoid being shredded by a .50 cal gun. A small .223 round will penetrate 1/4"" steel plate head on at 30 yards. So you get the picture. The bad guys storm out and riddle some empty 50 gallon steel drums with .223 or 7.62 rounds, which then bounce harmlessly away. No, they don't. That's what makes guns so terrifying--they go through walls. Again, a small .223 round will penetrate through several 2x4s before stopping, which could be through a couple houses, or even more.  Or, you watch a group of people get blown off their feet and back 25 feet because of the blast of ordinance. Again, humans don't survive that sort of kentic energy. Remember, a blast of military ordinance can expand at over 20, 000 feet per second or 14, 000 miles per hour. Getting hit with that blast close enough to blow you off your feet, into the air, and back 25 feet or more would cause so much internal damage you'd bleed out internally before you hit the ground.

Anyway, except for situations like that, which no writer or producer should ever make in the 21st century, and one episode of time travel, which Eisenstein, contrary to popular belief,  never said could work, the series is good and the characters grow on you. And, again, not as much as Star Gate /Atlantis/ Star Trek series. But it's fairly solid as far as sci-fi these days goes, which could be argued isn't too far.

It's too bad the series couldn't have kept going because by the 4th season, everything was starting to work really well. Buy it all at once and you can get it for around 10 bucks a season.",1384560000,2,2703,4.570247933884297

For season one I have to say the only disappointment I had is with the character Ashley. The actress is terrible or the writers hated her character; either way I was constantly disappointed with her screen time. The other actors do from a good to great job. I am a huge Amanda Tapping fan so I must say she is fabulous.

The art style seems influenced by Zack Snyder (bits of 300, Watchmen, and Sucker Punch); more so with the original webisodes which are also included on the disc. I am glad they included them on the disc. It is quite interesting to see the changes in the plot and characters from the initial web creation of the show to mainstream television.

The characters are not strong enough. They each need their own eccentricities to be more interesting.
Amanda Tapping's British accent seems to come and go.

Finally, conflicts get resolved too easily. The writers need to make things much harder on the characters. The bad guys need to be more of a challenge.

I will finish the season, but if it doesn't improve, will not buy the second season.",1355961600,2,572,4.7

This is like no other disc packaging that I've ever seen. There is no center snap to put the disc in. You have to try to slide it into 4 plastic half circles(2 of which were broken in delivery) and 2 tabs at the bottom ( one which was broken in delivery).

I was given a Downton Abby video as a gift for another purchase on Amazon and had watched this on the Thrive tablet, so I assumed I would be able to play this also. I finally came to the conclusion that I was watching Downton on Netflix not Amazon video, so my mistake with this purchase and not being very media savy.

Sanctuary seemed an interesting primise, but not sure when I will watch more of the episodes, don't watch tv much at home what with other responsibilities.",1353542400,,690,4.348837209302325

Something went very wrong during the manufacturing of these discs.  I've bought this item and had it replaced, and in both sets the 2nd disc simply refuses to play in a perfectly functional blu-ray player.  I even ran diagnostics on my blu-ray drive, and they all came up perfect.  The 2nd disc in this set is simply defective.

I'm going to try and get it replaced one more time, just to go for a hat trick, but I don't have high hopes.  I seriously suggest looking at the regular DVD's; I would doubt that this same manufacturing problem exists with them.

One last thing- this series is fantastic.  I'm really disappointed that I can't seem to get functional blu-ray discs for it, because it's one of my all-time favorite shows.",1352937600,3,870,4.496815286624204

The fans of Stargate should enjoy seeing Amanda Tapping in a role different from the one she did in the show and franchises that came from it. She plays Helen Magnus here and is also one of the producers.
Chistopher Heyerdaul does a spendid job in two roles. It is a treat to see and enjoy such fine acting talent as he shows.
The writting tightens up near the end and it was easy to watch all 13 episodes and get caught up in the characters and plots. I give this show 4 stars and say if you are looking for something different then this maybe your cup of tea.",1344988800,,755,4.073825503355705

3906915,5,B002CLKP00,I enjoyed the first three seasons of Sanctuary and can not wait to get the fourth and final season. One of the main characters is portrayed by Amanda Tapping I became a fan of hers as a result of her role in Stargate SG-1 she is able to swing with the changes in roles and characters.,1341705600,,284,4.089285714285714
3906916,4,B002CLKP00,"I had this series recommended to me about a year ago.  My buddy told me he had seen every episode a couple of times.  So I thought I would give it a try.  It is a decent series.  There are certainly a few flaws in this, but on the whole, it is worth a watch.

The first few episodes are a bit rough.  This is pretty typical of a new TV series as the actors are trying to determine their roles and the directors are trying to set the right tone.  The concept is new and refreshing, keeping 'abnormals' out of trouble.  The special effects are a bit cheezy - they don't have much of a budget for them on this show.  The characters are a bit predictable and stereotypical.

This is a pretty tame series - very much a PG rating here.  I find this kind of refreshing.  They are trying to tell a story, not shock and awe their audience.  The 'abnormals' are unique in some episodes and quite predictable in others.  It is interesting to see characters from old horror movies being brought back.  We have vampires, werewolves, mermaids, and even Jack the Ripper.  The story writers deploy a unified theory where every distinct creature can be described as some sort of 'abnormal'.

I found about half of Season 1 to be 5 star episodes and the other half were 3 and 4 star episodes.  Some are silly, others are dark and serious.

Pros:
o interesting and unique show concept
o new and old characters brought together
o good mix of action and plot

Cons:
o sometimes a bit cheesy
o first few episodes a bit slow in building characters

Overall - I recommend this series to my Sci Fi watching friends.",1334102400,6,1590,4.322033898305085
3906917,4,B002CLKP00,"So...my sister and I found a new series that we've been watching....well, it is actually going on its second season this fall, but if you have Netflix, you can catch the first season online. It is called 'Sanctuary' and will be on the new improved SyFy channel.

If you like the legends of old like the Folding man, Big Foot, animal mixed humanoids, and just things that go bump in the night, you will enjoy this dark fantasy/sci-fi show. Dr. Helen Magnus (played by Amanda Tapping) is a beautiful scientist that seems to has wisdom beyond her years and with the help of her daughter, Ashley (Emilie Ullerup) and a few other various colleagues, offer sanctuary for the world's 'abnormals', or creatures and beings that come from our legends and myths

Joining their little group is Dr. Will Zimmerman (Robin Dunne), a forensic psychiatrist whose mother was killed by something evil when he was young. Of course, laughed off as just a young boy in trauma, Will is ignored and becomes an eccentric...good at his job, but regarded as crazy. When a case that is not all that it seems lands in his sights, Will comes face to face with Dr. Magnus and her collection of creatures. As the pilot concludes, Helen offers Will a job, to work with her and protect the 'abnormals' finding them and giving them a sanctuary away from the destructive humans, who don't understand them.

Sanctuary reminds me a little of 'X-files' and has the dark raw humor of series like 'Angel' and 'Buffy'. Its characters are well developed and fun, though I have only watched a few episodes. The special effects are television quality and the action is believable or as much as a fantasy show can make it. As for the story lines, they are well played, interesting, and keep you guessing throughout the show.

If you miss the good fantasy felt in 'Angel', or the investigations in 'X-files', 'Sanctuary' offers that in a dark and fun way. It's an extremely entertaining romp and comes back this fall on the SyFy channel. Watch and enjoy!!",1331424000,4,2008,4.6960227272727275
3906918,5,B002CLKP00,"I went to the video store to rent Fringe, but they were out.  So I grabbed Santuary, even though I've never heard of it.

What immediately drew me in was the world itself.  This whole season is brimming with imagination.  Every episode was so fun to see which creature or legend they'd take on next.  I love the central concept, where these awesome creatures aren't killed but given Sanctuary.  If you were crossing your fingers for King Kong to be safely released back onto his island, you'll love the idea behind the Sanctuary.

The show has a great environment - gothic castle, high technology.

I love the characters.  Helen and Will especially grew on me as the series went on.  Helen is just awesome, and Will is extremely likeable - calm and assertive, and sharp.

My favorite episode - when the show really stepped it up in my mind - is ""Requiem.""  Two characters, one sub, and it was pulled off perfectly.

I'm glad to see this has at least 3 more seasons....can't wait to watch. :)",1326672000,,991,4.531073446327683

I have seen other reviews that call this a monster of the week show but I must at least partially disagree with that, while it is true that most episodes introduce a new ""monster"" the show also has a more than subtle understory that starts developing fairly fast after the first couple episodes and then comes and goes to varying degrees. All in all I can't say much more without adding spoilers, I will add for those who are already fans of the show that the extra content is good as well, especially if you have never seen the original sanctuary web series as it is included on disc 4.",1279584000,,817,4.27741935483871
3906948,3,B002CLKP00,"I will admit to ""liking"" this show in that it pulled me in by its attempt at a good storyline....but....

throw in an evil overlord (the kabol <sp?>) and their attempt to over throw the supposedly evil misformed creatures that aren't ""normal""....and then.....

throw in the group of Five (Watson from Sherlock Holms fame, Tesla (yeah, that one) as a vampire, The granddaughter of the Invisible Man, Jack the Riper, and.....who was that? Helen Magnas <have no idea>) and you have a second rate sci fi story.

now, i could have forgiven the hokey story, the evil bad guys trying to kill everyone that isn't ""human"" and the The Five, if they could only keep their story STRAIGHT. the story bounces around, makes things up, and changes history for the sake of the episode at hand.

Bad acting, bad special effects (beyond bad) and plots that are so thin you can predict each step along the way. Season 1 was worse than Season 2, but it's like comparing two piles of garbage that are rotting in the sun...which one smells worse?

It was a terrific concept (santuary for all) that was executed poorly. In Season 2, Will seems to be told ""ok, act tough here"" so he leaves his lower lip hanging as though seeing his teeth tells us that he's now a rough and buff toughie.

3906950,3,B002CLKP00,"Forgetting the fact that it feels a little like a Stargate rip, this show was much better than I expected.  The plotlines were more sophisticated, the CG more adventurous, and the characters were more appealing.  It's like League of Extraordinary Gentlemen meets Stargate SG1.  Being a television series, heavily laden with CG, that, while good enough for broadcast, probably wouldn't hold up on a large screen, I watched the Blu-rays on a modest 52"" 1080p in our living room, instead of in the dedicated HT.  At that size, it generally looked great, and the CG was believable enough, though use of green screens became more obvious in massion interiors, forsaking the illusion to some degree.  Still, overall, the shows ambition was worth a look.

The studio includes both lossless surround as well as basic stereo, which usually provides better clarity for people without surround sound, as downmixing in many players can be degrading, if not deleterious.  And intelligibility of the stereo mix was excellent.  There's a redundant DD 5.1 mix included as well, which is completely uneccessary as DTS HD includes an even better lossy core that every BD player should be able to extract. Having auditioned the show in our living room instead of our HT, I won't comment on either surround mix.  I would like to caution about the packaging though.  E1 has chosen a cheap cardboard and plastic packaging solution that's rather annoying to use, as two of the discs are stacked atop the others, meaning you have to remove disc 1 to get to disc 2 and you have to remove disc 3 to get to disc 4.

Disimilar to other cheap cases, however, this case uses a disc retaining system that I've never seen before and frankly hope to never see again, as it apparently doesn't work.  Despite good packaging by amazon, all four discs arrived loose in the case.  Fortunately, these aren't DVDs, which would have been scratched by the packaging for sure. Thanks to Blu-rays scratch resistant coating, the discs appeared to be undamaged.  However, the second disc froze in one spot, either due to unseen damage or replication error at the factory.  Cleaning the disc with a lint-free microfiber camera lens cleaning cloth did not help, either.  In case it is a production issue and not a result of the discs coming loose in the case or an isolated occurance, I'd suggest watching the series, at least disc two, before the return window closes, to avoid getting stuck with a defective disc - especially if your discs arrive loose too, but whether you see any damage or not.",1278892800,4,2550,4.814220183486238
3906951,2,B002CLKP00,"I absolutely love the show and the different creatures displayed on the show. I however was disappointed the way the dvds were packaged by using a different way to hold dvds in the tray. The company should have used the old format with the center hub to push the dvds out of plastic tray. The other disappointment was the 5.1 audio broadcast,because I had to literally turn the volume up to a ridicilous level just to hear the voices. The other bluray dvds I bought and own never had that problem,I have a bluray home theater and had to turn the volume to 25,while the other dvds was load at volume 20+.In my opinion the manufacture should go back and redo the complete set to satisfy the consumer considering the cost of the set. Best Buy does offer the set for $29.99 and season 1 for $32.99 but with the inferior product you still aren't getting the best product for the price anyway.

3906955,5,B002CLKP00,"As an Amanda Tapping fan I was excited about the series when it first started out as a Web only production.  I was very pleased that the support of a network allowed the show to continue to blossom.

The first few episodes have elements that are the same as the web based episodes, but there are some differences as well including cameos by Paul McGillion and David Hewlitt (Stargate Atlantis).  The show does continue to have cameos from other Stargate Alumni such as Kavan Smith.

The production on the web series was revolutionary having been shot almost entirely Green Screen with digital effects providing the backgrounds.  This allowed the creators much greater flexibility when writing the environments (and some of the residents) of the Sanctuary.  The tv based show continues this production method and with the additional resources provided by the network, the results are generally excellent.  The characters are unusual and well portrayed by an excellent group of actors.  The requisit suspension of disbelief is made possible by the combination of setting and character.

The story revolves around Dr. Helen Magnus (Amanda Tapping) and the Sanctuary she has created for ""Abnormals"".  Robin Dunne plays Dr. Will Zimmerman - a doctor with an usual talent for noticing things overlooked by others.  He is recruited by Dr. Magnus to provide psychological counseling to the residents of the Sanctuary and to assist with ""missions"".  Emilie Ullerup plays Helen's daughter, and Christopher Heyerdahl plays several characters, all with unique twists.",1273363200,,1555,5.251012145748988

3906959,3,B002CLKP00,"Imagine this: a giant gothic building that serves as a ""sanctuary"" to various strange, freakish and/or dangerous creatures that exist in the world.

That's the concept behind ""Sanctuary: The Complete First Season,"" a fantasy/sci-fi show that started off as a series of webisodes, then got turned into a show for the Sci Fi (Sy Fy?) Channel. The first season starts off shaky and sometimes painfully silly (nubbins!), but the second half suddenly smooths itself into a solid arc of secrets, conspiracies, and a fanatical enemy organization.

Forensic psychiatrist Will Zimmerman (Robin Dunne) has a pretty rotten life -- his girlfriend has left, his job is a joke, and nobody believes his deductions. But during a bizarre murder investigation, he encounters a strange woman named Helen Magnus (Amanda Tapping) who offers him a job at the Sanctuary.

The Sanctuary turns out to be a vast cathedral-like structure filled with ""Abnormals"" -- mermaids, elementals, iguana-men, two-faced dudes, and so on. But the Sanctuary's residents are now in danger from a charming Abnormal named John Druitt (Christopher Heyerdahl), who has a longtime connection to Helen. And unless he gets what he wants from her, he'll kill her daughter Ashley (Emilie Ullerup).

Other Sanctuary problems: a trio of amnesiac women, a drug lord among the Folding Men, an autistic boy whose pictures reveal Abnormals, a Himalayan plane crash with a mind-altering monster, a brain parasite, the superfertile Nubbins (like carnivorous Totoros), a man who looks suspiciously like Magnus' late father, and a pair of reporters who witness the Sanctuary team fighting rare killer insects.

And the Sanctuary has a new enemy -- the fanatical Cabal, who want all Abnormals under their control. When they unleash a biological weapon, Helen's old study group (""The Five"") must reunite to save the Abnormal population.

The first half of ""Sanctuary: The Complete First Season"" is a severely mixed bag -- most of it isn't really bad, but it's not terribly unique or gripping. And the ""nubbins"" (tribbles with teeth) episode is just embarrassingly silly. But with the introduction of Nicola Tesla (who is a vampire!), suddenly the entire series tightens up and becomes far more streamlined, complex and emotionally powerful.

Along the way, the writers fill the series with all sorts of freaky creatures, slimy body parts, and some gun-heavy action scenes. The writing is rather wobbly in the first half (""Women and geeks first... oh, no, that's all of us""), but the sci-fi edge gives it a quirky appeal (""I guess Ike didn't want to breathe the same air as the Nazi High Command."" ""Some of them didn't even breathe air""). And ""Sanctuary"" has a pretty striking look -- half industrial science complex, and half Gothic decay, with vast cathedral-like buildings, grey cloudy skies, and the half-ruined Old City.

Tapping is a powerful presence as the hyperintellectual, immortal Helen Magnus, and Dunne is brilliant from the start as the Daniel Jackson of the series (smart and geeky, with a tragic past). Ryan Robbins is great as the resident techno-superbrain (with his own Abnormal secret) and Christopher Heyerdahl does a brilliant two-character turn -- charming, smooth killer John Druitt, and shy but kindly butler Bigfoot.

The one false note is Ashley -- while Ullerup does a fair job, the character is an urban fantasy cliche -- cocky, gun-happy, and wears a leather catsuit during fights. But the supporting cast is pretty fascinating, especially since the writers start ushering in Victorian literary and historical figures.

""Sanctuary: The Complete First Season"" has some mighty wobbles in its first half, but the second half stabilizes and flowers like a black rose.",1268870400,4,3731,5.203333333333333

I was hoping for some original stories or more extensive background. Alas, not really true. They are broken up into 2 one hour stories. The first one is a pared down version of the first two eps, with a few different fluff type scenes. The second one is a longer version of the 3rd ep with an alternate ending that does not lend it'self to a continuing series. But there are lots of comentaries and stuff.  The photo gallery is not much though.  One thing that bothers me about the photo gallery is that they put them on the screen very small. I would prefer full screen.

Nice team of characters, an interesting central idea, even some good acting (that point unfortunately does not apply to the blond daughter persona). Amanda Tapping is simply amazing. I have never seen her before and was much impressed. She is also an extremely good choice for an ""immortal"" - she has a face of a beautiful young woman but her eyes are truly ageless.

There are some fascinating twists of well known historical figures like Tesla or Jack the Ripper. Episode plots are generally well put together, without (or nearly without) too much of a deux ex machina effects. The whole also fortunately lacks sentimentality and pathos, the heroes take their situation and themselves with a bit of a grin (sometimes werewolfish).

Strangely for some reason Sanctuary reminded me of the Firefly - perhaps as it too has a bit of a ""frontiere"" feeling to it. Or because it too is a very well balanced mix of different genres and ideas.",1264550400,,986,4.726744186046512

The best I can relate it to is a cross between Dark Angel (Dark Angel: Complete Season 1 [DVD] [2001]), Poltergeist the Legacy (Poltergeist The Legacy - Season 1 [DVD]), Veritas the Quest (never been released on DVD), and Primeval (Primeval - Series 1 and 2 Box Set [DVD]).

This series originally started as 8 webisodes available from 2007. These webisodes built up such a cult following that the series was eventually commissioned the television.

The series stars, and is produced by, Essex girl Amanda Tapping (Stargate) as Dr. Helen Magnus who is ably assisted by daughter Ashley Magnus (Emilie Ullerup), and Dr. Will Zimmerman (Robin Dunne). Also appearing as part of this ""Scooby gang"" are going Christopher Heyerdahl (""Bigfoot""), and Ryan Robbins (as Henry Foss).

The first TV season has 13 episodes, and the second season has now been commissioned and started filming in April 2009.

The extras include the webisodes and commentaries for all episodes. Description gives four discs that is plenty of room for a lot of extras (fingers crossed).

Unfortunately, Amanda Tapping does not shine in this series.  The accent that she affects is very off-putting.  The individual shows are very slow to develop and don't have very much oomph.

The series saving grace is the fact that it is shot entirely in front of a green screen but has not overwhelmed viewers.  In fact, most times you forget that it the show is so heavily special effects.  Although, even some of those special effects are questionable.  The mermaid is slightly fuzzy and doesn't appear to focus on the person she is interacting with.

I'm hoping that the second season will improve but if it doesn't this will mean that I won't be returning.

3906989,3,B002CLKP00,The quality of Amazon.com is always top of the line.  The only thing that really upsets me is that whenever I purchase over 2 items when my account is charged Amazon.com comes out with a special on those specific items.  Example:  I just ordered and received Sanctuary: The complete first season $24.99 and The Hunger: The Complete first season  $34.99.  Now I get a message that this 2 DVDs are now offered for the two for $44.99.  That is $14.99 cheaper than what I paid.  Why wasn't I notified that some of those items would be going on sale?  This has happened before.  Has it ever happened to you?,1254614400,,602,4.4495412844036695
3906990,4,B002CLKP00,"Going into the show, I was expecting Amanda Tapping to be the strong point. She's great, but it's the surprisingly good writing that makes it satisfying. Some of the plots are very Twilight Zone/Outer Limits in nature.

The show's main weakness comes from some of the supporting cast. Helen's daughter, Ashley (played by Emilie Ullerup), displayed some high school drama-level acting that was sometimes cringe-worthy. Other times, she did okay. Some of the other regulars had a few low moments as well.

Despite the uneven acting, I keep getting excited for the next episode on the disc for the writing.

Perhaps the acting will improve in season 2 and I can give 5 stars instead of 4.",1254528000,,685,4.837606837606837
3906991,1,B002CLKP00,"I had hopes for this series after the cancellation of Stargates: SG-1 and Atlantis. The Sci-Fi channel did fairly well with those. And Eureka is thoroughly enjoyable.

And while this show had a few interesting story arcs in an otherwise ho-hum season, it's most glaring problem is that it's special effects are terrible. I'm talking Ed Wood terrible. In a time when we know studios can make good effects, this is just flat out pathetic. Being on a budget is not a good enough excuse. These effects are so bad that they do not allow you to suspend your disbelief and enjoy the show. It's too glaringly obvious that their feet do not match the stairs they're using, or that the computer banks around the wall in their lab aren't really there, or that what they are looking at isn't there either.

The acting is not particularly good but it's not particularly bad. It's not really anything. I love Amanda Tapping and am very sad that I don't like a show she's in. It's not her acting that is sub-par. It's just that everyone else in the show is only okay.

The recent Star Wars Prequel trilogy should have been a reminder that special effects can NOT carry a movie - and they had all of Lucas' monetary empire at their beck and call. (I AM a huge star Wars fan, by the way.)Sanctuary is a great example of that just because you can do something, doesn't mean you should.

The only other series that was executed worse than Sanctuary was the failed Flash Gordon series. But that show had problems that went far beyond FX.

Now you could argue that Sanctuary as good as they can make it, or that the story is compelling enough to make up for it, or that I'm being too critical. And you're well within our rights. I know there will be fans out there mad because of what I write here. Believe me, I understand about someone criticizing a show you love. If you are compelled, try and rate this review based on what I said and not that I didn't like something you did. For me, TV/Movies are a visual medium. If it doesn't look right, it's distracting.

And just in case anyone is wondering, I did actually watch every episode of season one. I've even tried to watch a couple from the new season.",1254182400,34,2186,4.411910669975186
3906992,4,B002CLKP00,"While there is no doubt this is THE show I would have loved to see in Blu-ray, it is now a part of my collection in DVD.  I am baffled as to why they delayed the Blu-ray release of a program that aired in HD with high quality sound and all.  That is such an obvious play to get those people that want the show so bad they will wind up buying both because they can't wait, that it makes me sick.  It was my plan to simply hold off and wait for the Blu-ray release, however a well meaning friend has now given me this set of DVDs which now will suffice for me.

Now about the show.  I have long been a fan of science fiction though not so much of horror.  I find this show to have the right mix for me.  It isn't so off the hook gory that it makes me want to change the channel while still capturing the whimsy of a good science fiction/fantasy show.  Amanda Tapping shines in this show.  It is an actual show where she is allowed to act more than she has been in the past and she carries it off well.  The rest of the cast is great too, a perfect mix.

So why four stars?  Sounds like I feel the show is a five star show.  It is a five star show.  I am taking one star off for the marketing ploy of not releasing the Blu-ray version at the same time as hey did this one.",1253923200,4,1269,3.830769230769231

3906994,5,B002CLKP00,"When forensic psychiatrist Dr. Will Zimmerman encounters Dr. Helen Magnus, he is introduced to a whole new world of creatures from dreams and nightmares. Dr. Helen Magnus has taken the responsibility of providing a safe haven for ""abnormals,"" to protect them from the world and the world from them.

Amanda Tapping stars as Dr. Helen Magnus, the mysterious proprietor of the Sanctuary. Dr. Magnus' daughter Ashley is an expert fighter/sharpshooter and monster hunter, played by Emilie Ullerup. Robin Dunne is Dr. Zimmerman, new to the Sanctuary but with special gifts of his own. Ryan Robbins adds comedy relief to the show as the tech-geek in charge of keeping the Sanctuary safe as Henry Foss. And Christopher Heyerdahl makes special guest appearances as villainous John Druitt, who shares a secret past with Dr. Magnus.

Each episode is a dark, suspenseful, action-packed, and humorous, with a new creature (and mystery) to face. The characters are well-written and brilliantly cast. With each episode, more is revealed about the characters and the overlying arc of the story. When John Druitt comes on the scene, he is immediately apparent as the sinister ""bad guy."" But even he has a story and a reason for his actions.

With incredibly storytelling, fantastic characters, and stunning visual effects, Sanctuary is now one of my all-time favorite shows. It's one no science fiction fan should miss.",1253836800,13,1403,5.171806167400881
3906995,5,B002CLKP00,"I am a fan of Amanda Tapping, so it was very easy for me to give this series a chance. But it sure wasn't hard to like! I'm a lover of sci-fi, fantasy, and horror, and this series does them all.

I like the supporting cast too, but I'm even more impressed with the guest stars. The Tesla, Druitt, and Watson actors are top-notch.

The episodes that stood out the most for me were 'Requiem' (an Amanda Tapping tour de force), 'The Five', 'Kush', and 'Revelations pts 1 and 2'.

The people that make this series are from Stargate SG-1, and you can see the workmanship behind the episodes very well. (And I can't believe how wonderfully Amanda has sculpted yet another multi-layered character, in the form of Helen Magnus.)

This is a fun series, with an undercurrent of WOW and sad. Bring it on!",1253577600,6,793,4.448275862068965
3906996,3,B002CLKP00,"As a big fan of ""Stargate SG-1"" and ""Stargate Atlantis,"" I tuned in for season 1 of ""Sanctuary,"" which was created by Stargate producer Damian Kindler and starred his fellow Stargate alumnus Amanda Tapping.

Amanda Tapping plays Dr. Helen Magnus and runs a sanctuary where various unique creatures are safely housed.  She and her team sally forth each week to investigate any strange happenings around the globe.  Much like other TV programs, there is a continuous storyline along with the usual self-contained episode.  The concept of the show is, in and of itself, interesting and well-developed, plus there are enough characters and sub-plots going on that the show can maintain viewer interest.

But there are several aspects of ""Sanctuary"" that will nag at you as you watch . . . every time you watch.

1) The show is largely computer-generated . . . and shows it.  If you've ever seen an episode of the old ""Doctor Who"" with Tom Baker and attempted to enjoy its otherwise good story while watching a tinfoil-wrapped cardboard-box robot move across the screen, you'll know how difficult it can be to get past that.  Granted, ""Sanctuary"" has far better graphics, but most of the time you know you're looking at something fake.
2) Amanda Tapping's hair is ultra-black and her accent is English.  Neither suits her.
3) Her daughter on the show, Ashley, is a little too ""cool"" for the serious storylines.  I mean, I like a little high-spirited comedy a la Richard Dean Anderson's Jack O'Neill or Joe Flanigan's John Sheppard, but her continual flippancy just doesn't realistically fit.
4) Even when the sun shines on ""Sanctuary,"" it looks dreary, probably due to the CGI, to the Canadian filming location or both.
5) Dr. Will Zimmerman--who used to work with the police but who now works at the sanctuary--is played by a 32-year-old who looks about 22, lending a cyberpunk-type unbelievability to the show.  (""Hey, I'm 12 years old, but I know how to read hieroglyphics, am well-versed in cryptozoology AND demonology . . . and I'm socially well-developed too!"")

Is ""Sanctuary"" worth checking out if you're a science-fiction fan?  Sure.  Is it the best science-fiction show ever?  Not by a long shot.",1253491200,7,2202,4.929539295392954
3906997,3,B002CLKP00,"I have recently watched the new series with Amanda Tapping ""Sanctuary"" I think it has the possibility to be a good show, with some great ideas, felt a little weird listening to Amanda with an english accent, but wasn't too bad. Only thing that i would mention is that I think that by now CG work would be a whole lot better, being associated with those who worked on Stargate, the CG work was a little sloppy and if it was such a good idea to do so much green screen stuff, it looks a little amatuerish, would love to see it in more a live stage situation and less CG orientated stuff. But characters all seem good and look forward to seeing where it goes.
