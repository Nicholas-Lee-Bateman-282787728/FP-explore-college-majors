8428115,5,B004FOHSSE,"I am so glad to see this DVD version of the best biographical video of John Denver, containing the best, and sadly the last, song he ever wrote in my opinion: ""Amazon."" I hope the cost goes down soon because I can't afford it right now, but I have the VHS version which is not functional for me anymore. I would love to buy this DVD at $25 or less. Thank you.",1323302400,3,359,4.0
