Yeah, I'd like to see the first six seasons in Blu-ray as well (seasons seven, eight and nine are already on Blu-ray) but just because I don't like the format that product is being released in doesn't mean it should have a lower rating.",1405382400,30,363,4.352941176470588

6479898,1,B00LDCGBNE,"Great concept: real time, 24 hours, 24 one hour episodes. Yet, I would suggest you pass on this one and save your money! The script is horrible, the acting isn't any better, and the mistakes and unrealistic twists and turns just become so irritating that it's hard not to kick the tube. On top of it all, I had started watching season 1 while waiting for the full set to arrive, but when it did, the box arrived smashed and some of the DVD boxes broken thanks to Amazon's usual poor packaging. Sent it back. Second box arrived and it's a used box that has been shrink wrapped again. I paid for a new product; not acceptable, so it goes back also, and I am done with it.  Waste of time, and waste of patience.",1518912000,,708,4.2444444444444445

Buy the whole think. Wow, one of the best series I have ever seen. Well-done Kiefer Stherland !!!!! And all the
Ppl who didn't find it entertaining, why have you buy it in the first place ? I will watch it over and over, glued to the
Screen. Reason I give 4 instead 5 star because the quality of packing and assembly need some improvement. ( The security sticker that initiate alarm at
Department stores door was glued on the reading side of the CD. Wow, how stupid ) if you don't mind all the
Small imperfections in the packing, every penny spent

6479919,5,B00LDCGBNE,"I received my copy of 24 The Complete Series on DVD today.  It is a beautiful set with every episode of 24 on DVD.  I only have 2 complaints.  First having opened the first three seasons on DVD, I can tell you that seasons 2-8 come in the widescreen versions of the shows.  Having a 40 flat screen tv, the only way you can get the video to take up the screen is to select the zoom feature on your TV.  Second, each disc contains 4 episodes, but there is no Play All feature which is bothersome.

Still its a beautiful complete  set  for the price.  $80 with tax & handling.  Thats $10/season for a great show.  You have every episode of 24 in one package.  I highly recommend buying this set to any 24 fans",1500422400,6,706,4.110294117647059
6479920,1,B00LDCGBNE,"The reason I give this 1 star is because you get the box set that looks pretty gorgeous and you're all excited until you find when you open the box to check the discs to see what kind of condition they're in and you see scratches/marks/fingerprints etc. It is pathetic that discs for these collections (being the price they are sold at) are double checked before shipping/sending them out. I cannot tell you the amount of box sets I've had to send back for this reason alone, and all because someone packaging in some warehouse can't take the time to carefully store a disc properly. With that said it is doubtful that I will ever order another box set from Amazon or anywhere else for that matter again. Fool me once, Shame on You, Fool Me twice...You get the picture. or in this case, the box set! Or do you???",1499472000,2,812,4.42
6479921,3,B00LDCGBNE,"First of all. 24 is my favorite show-EVER! Why this entire series isn't on BLURAY is one of the great mysteries of the universe. With all it's action, it deserves to be in Bluray! The DVDS in this set are good, except EVERY SINGLE season has broken rings that hold the DVDS securely, so some of the discs are scratched badly due to becoming dislodged and bouncing around. I had to purchase clear DVD boxes from Amazon and spend an hour replacing all the broken ones in this box set, that constitutes 90%. You get what you pay for and while I got a fabulous price, I spent extra $$$ and time having to repackage each season. FYI: Couldn't find 7 dvd holders, so all the special features(disc 7) had to go into a loose sleeve. I wished I had watched these all BEFORE I gave away my separate boxed seasons to a friend. I could have replaced the dvds that skipped or froze due to scratches from horrible packing.",1498867200,,908,4.347058823529411

6479931,5,B00LDCGBNE,"great concept to do a show where the season goes through a 24 hour period. what can I say about 24: INTENSE! each season has it's own intensity to it, right up to the end. I was not aware of how good an actor Keifer Sutherland is - he is very good, as well as the rest of the cast. this program is almost too real. absolutely great entertainment - don't watch it too late in the evening or it could keep you awake.",1494979200,,414,3.9404761904761907

6479961,5,B00LDCGBNE,24.  Great box set!,1474329600,,19,3.75
6479962,5,B00LDCGBNE,The 24 box set was one of the best package box sets I've seen in a long time it had all 8 seasons of 24 plus Live Another Day and 24 Redemption the 24 movie 24 is one of the greatest most action-packed suspense thrillers that was ever on TV most shows about terrorism and the units or or government agencies the catch them or investigate them are slow and hard to follow and boring in my opinion but in 24 the organization CTU counter-terrorism unit and the character Jack Bauer is one of the best written shows on TV everything about it even the acting was one of the greatest on TV that I have seen in a long time relating to the subject their idea to  see how much you could put the main character through in both physical and emotional pain call in one 24 hour day which Takes place in the whole season was a great idea you feel for the main character you feel for the other characters but in the end you never suspect who was really behind the acts of terrorism going on that they were investigating it's one of the few series that I have watched from the very first episode to the very last episode of the season it is very hard to pull away from your TV it is almost addicting to watch the series and then you can't wait to see what happens in the next season up until this show Kiefer Sutherland was never really one of my favorite actors I like to see some shows he was all right to me but after watching 24 he has propelled to one of the best TV actors I've seen but we got to remember that it's not just the actors in the show that make the show it's everything going into it the script the Wardrobe Department the makeup Department special effects Department and the stage setup and the stagehands the editing and The directors and everybody else who works on it putting all that into it if you do not watch this show you were truly missing out seasons 1 through 8 in my opinion or the greatest suspense thrillers on TV season 9 24 Live Another Day wraps up the storyline of Jack Bauer but don't worry they're working on the 10th season so the suspense and action will continue just without Kiefer Sutherland and you'll understand why when you watch the end of Live Another Day even the movie 24 Redemption was a great storyline not my favorite in the series but still worth watching because if you miss it you'll not understand what's going on in the next season which Falls between season 6 and season 7 this show really gets into the true nature of human the good and the bad and you'll never see what's coming from one moment to the next you'll be on the edge of your seat it has everything you'll be laughing you'll be crying you'll be on the edge of your seat while they're fighting and rooting on the characters even Jack Bauer and sometimes you won't even realize your rooting on the good guys or the bad guys because believe me you'll never know who is who in the show it will definitely go down in history of TV the show takes place in one season which of the 24 hour. Each episode is in real time of a one hour. And the whole season takes place within a 24-hour period trust me as confused as this might seem it is a great show to watch and it's not confusing when you're watching it I give it 5 out of 5 Stars don't miss it,1473811200,12,3247,4.170382165605096

A great deal of violence.  And, I would hope US Federal Agents behave better than those depicted in the series.
A fair price for all the DVDs in the series.
I was streaming the series on Roku; but AT&T was breaking the bank for data usage.
(Have I mentioned how much I dislike AT&T.)
Video quality is very good.  (Should be since it was digitally filmed.)
A few of the DVDs do not CC which I sometimes use.
Edit: Actually they are CC subtitled.  My player will turn on subtitles on some discs; on others they must be enabled in the disc menu.

6479989,5,B00LDCGBNE,"I loved X-files, but 24 is every bit as engaging and thrilling. The characters are amazing and the plot lines are exciting.
If you can get beyond the fact that it seems none of the characters EVER sleep, and remember each season covers 1 day, 24 Hours. It's more believable. And if you can get beyond the fact that the main character, Jack Bauer, played by Kiefer Sutherland, NEVER dies . . . while people are dropping like flies all around him, it's an AMAZING series. It makes you think about potential real time situations, like nuclear war and biological weapons. It's a fast paced and exciting series

In this dramatic series, each season takes place within one 24 hour period.
Season 1/Day 1 -- Jack Bauer leads an elite team of field ops for the Counter Terrorism Unit, or CTU. The agents of this government agency uncover an assassination plot which targets Presidential nominee David Palmer played by Dennis Haysbert. This is my FAVORITE of ALL the presidents on the series!  He's an in charge, very matter of fact kind of guy, who does what it takes to keep the country safe. Unfortunately, he's married to a very manipulative woman, Sherry,  played by Penny Johnson Jerald. He also has problems with his two kids, something a president sure doesn't need.  Jack is married to Teri, who only lasts one season before she's killed.  LOL Jack has a daughter, Kim, played by Elisha Cuthbert. She starts out the series as a somewhat troubled teen, who fortunately lasts the entire 8 seasons, because she's absolutely adorable, and becomes a major part of the story line.

Mary Lynn Rajskub, who plays CTU Analyst, Chloe O'Brien. I love her moody, super intelligent, computer analyst character. Her character was initially only brought on for a couple of episodes, but was so popular, she became second only to the character of Jack Bauer. The character development is wonderful, and although she starts off as somewhat of a minor player, she becomes integral to Jack, and to the story line.

Carlos Bernard plays Tony Almeida, Jack's trusted partner, who lasts through season 7. Tony's wife, Michelle, also a CTU agent, played by Reiko Aylesworth. I was really disappointed when her character was killed in season 6.

It's a great series. If you love crime/political thrillers, you'll like this one!
(No aliens, of the paranormal variety, in this one)

Back to the series, I never watched the pilot and I only watched few previews, it just got me hooked. I usually like to watched Monk, White Collar, Castle, etc. Not sure if this is the series that I like to watched. This series just give me more excitement because of the action and the meaning of 24. time is running out. Now, I'm on season 3... of course first season is always the best, but still it doesn't disappointed me.

6480060,5,B00LDCGBNE,"Like a lot of 24 (Kiefer Sutherland) fans I loved the series about a counter terrorism unit headed by Jack Bauer.  This action packed series had nine seasons and even though this 24 the complete Series was a little pricy, I purchased it new at a bargain price on Amazon.

This fantastic 60-disc collection offers all nine, seasons the feature-length 24: Redemption and a bonus disc of exciting special features.  There were a few unique and controversial aspects of the 24 series.  (1)  It was made in real time which had never been done before with a series. This makes it a fast moving and suspenseful series.  (2) The character of Jack Bauer is a single minded politically incorrect head of CTU (Counter Terrorism Unit).  The far left hated him because Jack used any method at his disposal to obtain information from the terrorists.  For him, the end justifies the means if it saves American lives.

 In my opinion, Jack Bauer represented the feelings and philosophy of many Americans after the 911 terrorist attacks on our country.  For a very short time most Americans came together in protecting our country and its values.  Sadly, in our supposedly Brave New World of far left liberal philosophy dominating our culture today we now negotiate with terrorist countries and groups who tell us openly they want to destroy us.  Viewing this series is like seeing history being repeated because we actually do not learn from history.

This complete series has 9057 minutes of material and I loved seeing one season after the other in this set.  If you are a Jack Bauer 24 fan and miss a hero who does not comprise his principles and patriotic duties to keep America safe, this series is for you.

Rating: 5 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Never Trust a Politician: A critical review of politics and politicians)",1440288000,30,1816,4.787781350482315

6480073,4,B00LDCGBNE,"My first comment is in regards to the boxed set.  My only issue was that in season 3, I received two copies of disc 2 and was missing disc 3.  Fortunately, I was able to use Amazon Prime to watch the missing episodes.  That is why I am rating this as 4 stars instead of 5.

Now my comments about the show:

I have spent the last several weeks on a 24 binge watching the show from the beginning.  I had hoped that when I got to season 8 (marketed as the series finale) and saw the character Renee Walker return, I would finally have my happy ending.  I had envisioned the final scene as showing Renee and Jack getting on a plane heading for Los Angeles so that Jack could live happily ever after with his daughters family and Renee, a woman he deeply cared for.  Alas, that didn't happen.  When I watched the mini-series Live another day, I was looking forward to Jack finally finding some joy and happiness.  Once again I was left disappointed.  Jacks life was marked with suffering.  He had to abandon his family to ensure their protection and with one exception, Chloe, everyone he had ever cared for and called a friend had either betrayed him, died, or both.  Live another day just added to his grief and misery.

The creators of the show have done us a disservice.  I hope that they produce another season  perhaps calling it Not dead yet where he saves the day in Russia and gains a Presidential pardon from the Russian president as he has from President Heller.  Perhaps Kate Morgan and Chloe head to Russia to attempt a rescue and the two of them, along with Jack, prevent a military coup of the Russian government because the Russian economy is almost ready to collapse.

The show was fast paced and riveting.  It was a thrill to watch and worthy of 5 stars.  However, the way it ended has left me feeling empty wondering if the ride was worth it.  All you have to do is watch the news to see how bad things are in the real world.  There aren't too many happy endings.  It would be nice if our fictional world showed us that it was possible.  After all the pain and suffering Jack has endured and all of the good he has done, he needs to find love and spend the rest of his life with his family.",1438473600,2,2204,4.280871670702179

A few months ago I found the entire series on a streaming service but it was leaving at months end. I bought this box set on Amazon and I am absolutely pleased with my purchase and the show. My son was reading some of the packaging and run time information and gasps ""Approx. 9057 Minutes?"" ""I don't think I could watch anything for that long""",1436140800,,521,4.427083333333333

Somehow I missed this on TV - it never really grabbed my attention the way some other series did, like Chuck, Lost, Once Upon a Time did. After watching the first couple seasons I still have the same general feeling for the show - this tries to be a thriller but falls a bit short somehow - I'm not sure if I can explain why... Every once in a while a particular episode will have a nice surprise cliffhanger, but usually it is a bit too predictable. I never really connected with any of the characters, perhaps because they keep killing them off or switching them out each season? But I still think this is a ""good but not great"" kind of show, and if you can get it at a good price it is probably worth watching at least once. I am not sure if 24 will stay on my shelf though.",1435708800,,903,3.994475138121547

6480122,5,B00LDCGBNE,"It will grab you and never let you go. Ever heard that about other TV shows and movies? It's an overused phrase to the point of becoming a cliche, but it has never been so true as it is with 24. 24 will draw you in and affect you more profoundly than any other show in TV history. In fact it can be a difficult show to watch because of the intense emotions you will experience at times.  It has a sense of realism that I've never seen in other shows, which further strengthens the effect it has on you. I just finished the last episode of season 8 and I was sobbing uncontrollably by the end of the episode. I am nearly in tears as I write this review, thinking about how this show has affected me and knowing that season 8 was the last regular season for the show. I wish they had continued the show for many more years, although there's a lot to be said for going out on top. You will feel love for Jack Bauer, Tony Almeida, Michelle Dessler, Chloe O'Brian, David Palmer, Aaron Pierce, and many other characters. And you will feel intense hatred for some of the evil characters in 24. Charles Logan is one that comes to mind. I found myself at times unable to contain my hatred for some of the bad guys, shouting curses at them.  I haven't seen 24:Redemption or Live Another Day yet and I'm looking forward to seeing them, but in a way I'm also dreading it because I know I will be sobbing again after watching the last episode.",1432944000,,1430,4.2153284671532845
6480133,5,B00LDCGBNE,"Of course you can't go wrong with 24. Sure some seasons are better than others, but they are all great. The only reason I wouldn't buy this is because they are all currently available on Netflix. Since Netflix has actively offered full series television shows such as this one, whereby you can literally watch any episodes from the season whenever you wants on any device you wants no matter what, it becomes difficult for me to justify the purchase  of disks that will no doubt get replaced in a few years by higher definition technology. I need this mistake with shows like the Simpsons and the Sopranos and bought them on DVD. Seeing them now being sold on Blu-ray makes me sick. And the joke is that if I ever want to watch any show that I own the disc of, I always end up streaming that show from either Netflix or HBO go",1432771200,,826,4.363636363636363
6480134,3,B00LDCGBNE,"First and foremost, this is a review of the product, not the show.  Very important distinction.  I LOVE this show and give the show itself 5 stars hands down.

I give this DVD set 3 stars for a couple of reasons.  One of the biggest is that some of the discs don't work and freeze up whatever player is playing them.  I've made it through the end of season 3 without any issues but when I put the season 3 bonus disc into my Blu-ray player, the loading screen played and then the screen went black and the player locked up.  I couldn't stop the disc, eject the disc, or even turn the player off.  I had to unplug it and eject it after I turned it on again.  My player has the latest firmware but to test it, I put the disc in my PS3 and the exact same thing happened again.  I couldn't eject the disc nor could I turn my PS3 off by pressing the power button, using the controller, or even holding the power button.  I had to unplug my PS3 from the wall which scared me to do but luckily no damage was done.

On some of the discs, there was also an unusually high amount of graininess.  I know these are DVD's and there are up-scaling issues from time to time but this wasn't a resolution grainy.  It was more of a 300 (the movie) Blu-ray type of grainy (done on purpose in that film).  My wife even commented on it which she doesn't usually pick up on.

Lastly, this is very minor and getting nitpicky but the DVD menus aren't very good.  There is no play all feature and you have to go into each episode, and then hit play in that menu - which is fine, but these menus all take 3-5 seconds to load to then select what you want to do.  So if you finish the first episode of a disc, you start on that episodes screen which you then have to go back to the main menu, select the next episode, then hit play on that menu.  Again, this is not a dealbreaker by any means but in conjunction with the two above issues, it really is a nuisance.",1432339200,55,1935,4.0473684210526315

6480153,4,B00LDCGBNE,"24 is a great TV series. I'm dissipointed that they only made 8 full seasons.
Season one- action packed, thriller that left you guessing and shocked with every twist and turn to the very end. Although it had too much kidnapping in it
Season 2 was not as good as the first. Kim's part was so so and their was too many main missions through out the episodes
Season 3- phenomenal! Not one bad thing to say about this season this was the best one.
Season 4 is just the opposite of the third one. This is the worst one. Everything they did in the first 3 seasons they basically did it again in this season, not to mention the main mission included a new one like every 4 episodes.
Season 5 was not as good as three but was my second favorite one with the nerve gas. Torwards the end of seasons from here on the last 8 episodes started to feel more political and thus they started to loose something.
Season 6- was good up until the last 8 episodes and again it started to lose something. It also opened up another mission which in
My opinion they should of stretched the main mission out to cover the remaining 8 episodes. The was the second worst season
Redemption - was created to have a 2 hour premiere leading up to the seventh season most likely due to the 2 year gap between season 6 and 7. Although this was good it was not necessary to watch, if you miss redemption you would not be lost
Season 7- my third favorite one kept the same mission throughout the season
Season 8- didn't care for this one. It didn't seem to start as strong as the previous ones. I didn't care for what seemed a character change in jack nor the change of character in the president
Live another day- besides all of the actors looking really old. This mini season didn't  keep in with the 24 episodes theme it only contains 12 and than jumps another 12 hours at the end of the last episode. I thought that it was fairly good through.
I highly reccommend this to anyone who loves suspense action movies or shows. The $136.00 is actual price if you bought it individually so to make sure you get them all consider this bundle pack. If you miss one you miss a lot",1429401600,,2138,4.253071253071253

Now let me talk about the show in general. Like the the title of my review it is the greatest show ever made. Kiefer Sutherland does an amazing job as Jack Bauer,his performance draws u into the show. He is the glue that hold it together along with an awesome cast. Now the show is called 24 because each season is just a DAY,a day in the life of jack Bauer. It follow him as he works with CTU(counter terrorist unit).With that u kinda get an idea of the story  line. NOPE!!There are so many twist in this show my review does not do it justice.

6480272,5,B00LDCGBNE,"24 Live Anothed Day had me on the edge of my seat every episode.  The acting is superb, the plot complex and utterly excitiing and the characters are real and ones for whom you care.  I shed a few tears in the last episode because I feel so attached to the great characters.

Bauer/Southerland is the BEST spy action hero, edging out Borne and Bond, O'Brian/Rajskub is a lovable, caring attractive and most intelligent in computer geek support,  Heller/Devane, is a very believable President,  he is a consumate professional actor, (check out Devane's early work in Rolling Thunder, one scene will stay with you forever), Morgan/Strahovski, the new team member, is a wonderful addition to the series, the perfect sexy action sidekick to Bauer, Audrey Boudreaux/Raver was great as always, and the villians delectibly evil.

I did not think I would like the shortened season, wanting to see another 24 episodes, but the shortened 12 episode season was breathtakingly exciting.  I hope to see another season soon.

6480303,5,B00LDCGBNE,"The ""24"" series, in my opinion is the BEST series that ever hit tv. I cannot say enough about it. The characters, the charters of the character. the plots, the ethics, the realism of humanity, the idealism of people, the portrayals of human strengths & their weakness without using figurative superhuman figures ie: spiderman / superman & the like, maturity and even (for the type of show) the cleanliness of language & programing. It is my hope that Kiefer Sutherland and Fox get a clear understanding from  the viewers that we want it and that they make it the longest running series EVER. HINT: i should have at least another 40 years left for tv viewing. This show has always & still, builds up in me inspiration-(In Real Time)  instills within me the desire to be all that i can be, To make a difference in this world for the right moral honest ethical reasons -(In Real Time). With the understanding that we live in an imperfect word and we are imperfect people. I hold Kiefer in high regard in his talent and ability to portray his character (Jack Bauer) in such an inspiring depiction of an honorable man in an imposable situation and the turmoil & pain he must live with.

These are MY sincere thoughts on this show.
This is the most i could say in the least amount of words

In-fact I no longer buy dvds at all it's Blu-ray or nothing (dvds what's the point why buy a hdtv n watch sd media?), I still have the old dvd sets and I won't be buying LAD on dvd or Blu-ray so fox won't be getting money from me on this not until they release the Blu-ray complete set then it's worth it then at least we get something new instead of old dvd masters that have been re-released a half dozen times.

This show deserves Blu-ray and I have no intention of buying LAD on its own I'm sure others will think the same (i'll wait for the complete set) so blu sales for LAD will be a little lower, why they didn't take advantage and release a complete Blu-ray set is beyond me, whoever makes these decisions at fox is really messing up, they should have struck while the series was hot and at it's peak again but now they loose that and on top of that they've hampered sales on LAD for those people waiting for a full set and afraid if they do buy it on it's own the inevitable complete set will come out and they will have lost money.

What are you thinking FOX ? and it's not just 24 but X-files as well come on FOX your missing the boat get some better people in the decision making process right now 24 and x-files are hot again how long do you think it will last?
