I got the drama and put in. the first cd and I have to say the subtitles were terrible. For 1) they gave all the characters Chinese names 2) It gave literal translations and uses phrases that are not familiar to english speakers. The fact that I had seen the series before purchasing the DVD gave me a better understanding of what they were saying but it was still sort of difficult. Other than that I love the drama and the performances were great.",1308268800,,569,4.327102803738318
