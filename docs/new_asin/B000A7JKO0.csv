8455324,5,B000A7JKO0,"This movie has won the Best Short Film prize in 2000 at the prestigious European Film Awards. While it's only half an hour long, this short film does a great job showcasing the life of a stork, which gets left behind in a small Hungarian village as its companions migrate to warmer climates for the winter. It captures the interesting, and sometimes quite odd, interactions between men and animal. There are no spoken languages throughout the film, the images are really speaking for themselves. If you like short films this one will surely please you.",1122681600,,552,4.821052631578947
