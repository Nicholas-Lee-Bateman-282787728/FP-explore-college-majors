8281559,1,B001B2S3ZK,Movie Would Not Play On My DVD Player. Company Was Wonderful. Paid Postage To Return It. Would Order From Them Again.,1418428800,,117,4.619047619047619
8281560,1,B001B2S3ZK,"I bought this DVD set because I love Polanski...he spoke at my commencement exercises in 1972. Imagine my surprise when the DVD absolutely would not play anywhere in America...apparently only in Europe. The cost to return the DVDs was more than the cost of the DVDs, so I still have them. Perhaps someday, if and when I ever move to Europe, I can watch them. Because of this, I will not purchase any more DVDs from this source. You'd think that someone might check the shipping address and make sure they were in the right play zone, country, or whatever, but no. I've never heard of this problem before, and hope to never experience it again. Be extremely careful when ordering from this source, and make it CRYSTAL CLEAR where you are.",1376006400,2,737,4.590909090909091
