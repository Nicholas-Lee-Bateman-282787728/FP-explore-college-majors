972317,5,6305132143,"I first thought this movie was too weird and at first was confused as to what Helen I was seeing, in which reality. I finally figured it out. The reality with James, Helen had short blond hair.
I almost wanted to cry when Helen in both realities, had an bad accident at the same time and lost the baby in both. It was really sad when Helen (with James) died.
I was wondering if, and hoping so, that Helen, in the other life, where she lived, would meet her Prince Charming (James)
I was very happy to see, she missed her elevator. But she met her Prince Charming.
I think I can conclude that she'll get her HAPPILY EVER AFTER.
I think it is worth watching a second time. I can enjoy it more, because I won't have to concentrate so much on OKAY, WHERE ARE WE AT NOW? AND WHICH HELEN IS THIS?
I first thought this would be an, OKAY, I WANT TO SEE THIS TO THE END, CAUSE I'M CURIOUS. BUT IT'S N CERTAINLY NOT A ""MUST SEE AGAIN."" IT IS ABSOLUTELY A ""WORTH WATCHING A SECOND TIME."" GREAT MOVIE!",1503360000,,989,4.129533678756476

972323,2,6305132143,I was very disappointed in this movie. I think the concept of two lives running in parallel is very good with the script was very weak. I like Paltrow but it seemed like she was dragging on in both the roles for no reason.,1502409600,,222,4.068181818181818

The whole plot of watching two versions of someone's life is intrresting. But for goodness sake......cast it well. The Scottish guy who plays a role in this film doesn't belong in it. Rather pathetic. Not worth streaming.",1501977600,,343,4.931034482758621
972366,5,6305132143,"Every few years I find myself watching this cleverly done film, yet again. It never fails to charm. Featuring terrific performances by Gwynneth Paltrow, John Lynch,  John Hannah, and Jeanne Tripplehorn,  it tells the story of Helen, a young English woman (Gwynneth Paltrow), who is working in public relations and living with Gerry (John Lynch), who is a total cad, as he is, unbeknownst to Helen, having an affair with his former girlfriend (Jeanne Tripplehorn).

When Helen leaves her job to return home, the film splits off into two case scenarios, one where she makes her train, and one where she doesn't, as the sliding doors close off her entry. Hence, the name of the movie. From then on, the film presents the viewer with two case scenarios. One featuring Helen's life, had she gotten home sooner, and one featuring Helen's life had she gotten home later. You be the judge as to which one is preferable.

The film seamlessly weaves these two stories in and out throughout the film, allowing the viewer to see the differences between what was and what might have been. John Hannah,  in the role of James, the nice guy who comes to Helen's  rescue, is more prominent in one scenario, yet the viewer still sees him in the other, almost as if he and Helen were as ships passing in the night, with the  promise of things to come. Yet, as the viewer will discover, all roads lead to Rome.

The film provides much food for thought on free will, predestination, and other metaphysical issues. This is a remarkable  film, beautifully directed and with outstanding performances by the entire cast. I absolutely love it!",1501977600,2,1617,4.746428571428571
972367,4,6305132143,"Everyone at some point in their lives wonders "" what would have happened if I had done this instead of that"".  This movie addresses that question and lets you see both views.  It can be a bit tricky keeping up with which life is which but it is done in such a way that you can tell them apart.  It  does require you paying attention to what is going on.  If your one of those that like to do other things while watching a movie then pass this one up.  It deserves your undivided attention.",1501891200,2,489,4.094736842105263

I knew the overall gist of the story but had never seen it. Well, 20 years after it's release I finally did and I loved it a lot. I am normally not a big Gwyneth Paltrow fan, but she juggles her role(s) well. John Hannah for me is the beating heart of the movie and if you have one, you will relate to the two stories in the movie and our eternal fascination with serendipity, fate, karma, kismet, ""meant to be"" and even a little bit of redemption and gumption.",1491350400,2,733,4.169014084507042

Sliding Doors
I have wanted to see this Gwyneth Paltrow film for years and finally got around to viewing it.  She comes through as one of the primire actresses of our age and in no uncertain terms.  Director Peter Howitt directed from his own script.
 Bright, beautiful Helen lives with a sensitive, intelligent fellow who works and works at writing his first novel while she works and works to support him.  The plot turns on a chance delay in her journey to work, a few seconds that cause her to miss the tube (she lives and works in London) to work.  In an instant re-play she catches the train and makes it to work on time.  The rest of the film plays two versions of her life in sequence.
 In one version she gets fired from her job and catches her lover in the arms of Jeanne Tripplehorn that very day.  In the other version she doesn't discover his infidelity until much latter in the story.  And so on.  Helen really has every thing a person should have.  She has intelligence and a strong sense of direction and a great work ethic.  She has talent in her field, she promotes-ie. she finds ways to make a business draw attention to itself, to attract customers and become successful.  But she has a blind spot for the man she loves.  He has no virtues.
 We might take this as a tale of caution, to warn young women to be careful about who they love.  Louts abound everywhere in every age.  John Hannah and John Lynch play the lout and the good fellah in Hellen's various lives.
 Beyond that the tale explores the nature of probability.  Can we change the flow of time and history?  Or is reality fixed, are our lives written is stone?  The script never makes this exploration explicit but it sits there none the less.  If we make a right turn or a left turn at a particular point in our lives, will things materially change?  Perhaps but perhaps not.
 But we should not sleep with jerks.  That comes through very clearly.  And Gwyneth shows herself to be not just an excellent actress but to dominate the screen as a major movie star.",1470009600,2,2056,4.401595744680851

This film does a great job of either confusing you sot that you give up, or enticing you to keep trying to figure it out.

Beyond that, the juxtaposition of what could have happened had the door not closed and what could have have happened had it not was a scramble that taxed the viewer to keep things straight.  In the end, it was unsatisfying that catching the tube led to discovery of the affair, disappointment, rebound, and death while not catching the tube led through a lot of sacrifice for a cad before an eventual awakening to the facts and emancipation.

1)  Gwyneth Paltrow is grossly underweight in this movie.
2)  Good thing Helen got her hair cut and bleached, otherwise I would not been able to follow this movie at all. I know, I'm not stupid... I know they did that on purpose so we could tell the difference between the two Helens.

975048,4,6305132143,"Sliding Doors is one of Gwyneth Paltrow's best films, made when she was in several films a year just between Emma and Great Expectations. This was before she became an object of scorn and outright hatred for many people, a stance which tells more about their pettiness than anything about the actress. Many negative comments online about the film are really about this subtext.

The film itself straddles the line between romantic comedy and serious romance and is really about life's possibilities. I think everyone at some time has one of those big events that happen in the course of a life, a terrible accident or better, a happy chance event that causes one to pause for a moment and realize all the tiny decisions and chance events that actually create almost any momentary event. This is what the film is really about. We are introduced to Helen Quilley just as she gets fired and heads home from her workplace. (Not a spoiler. It happens in the first few minutes). In one scenario she catches the underground and arrives home early; in the other the doors close and she arrives home late. At that point two different timelines are established leading to two different life outcomes for Helen. I'm not giving any more away than that.

The director and writer, Peter Howitt, does a nice job of switching back and forth between the two resulting stories almost simultaneously without creating a mess of things. It helps that the Helen who catches the train decides to cut her hair and go blonde; a writer's trick, I know, but a useful one. Gwyneth is excellent portraying both versions of Helen, one more naive than the other.  The supporting cast is generally excellent, especially John Hannah as James. The ending, while left up to the viewer is generally satisfying.

I do have a few reservations about the film and here I will place a MILD SPOILER WARNING. I will not give away specific events but will necessarily touch on a few plot elements. I found John Lynch as Gerry, Helen's boyfriend, to be totally miscast. With his perpetual hangdog expression, his leech-like ways and general incompetence, he was not believable as a man two strong women would want. This really hurt the film for me and is why I give it four stars and not five.  Secondly, i didn't get whether the director was hinting at a certain amount of predestination at work in life or not, but certain major events happened in both of Helen's lives that would suggest that. I wish he would have elaborated more on that but perhaps he left it as something to think about. Finally, Helen seemed to be realizing more of her potential in one timeline than in the other and this becomes an issue to think about. The left open ending leaves it open as a potential possibility.",1463356800,2,2748,4.681159420289855

After that, it's a sweet story, well acted (except by Paltrow, who is always herself) and pleasantly photographed, with a sufficient cast of likeable characters to be worth watching on a quiet evening at home.

Her relationship with her cheating boyfriend wasn't very believable - we don't know why she cares about this guy - and it's hard to figure out who she is (beyond being drop dead gorgeous). The device of having parallel stories hinging on a single incident is an intriguing one and kept me watching through the end. Eh!,1462924800,,406,4.575342465753424

976801,5,6305132143,"This is not the first time I watched the ""Sliding Doors"". It's on my all-time favorite list. This movie cleverly depicts the perennial question (or debate) in life of whether life is predetermined or is by choice.

The movie cleverly does this by running 2 side-by-side scenarios of ""what-is"" and ""what-might-have-been"" IF another option was taken as opposed to the other or 1 event happening as opposed to another.

Good twist in the end and the question remains to be ""after all the long and short cuts in life, the criss-crossing of such events in either or both choices/chance scenarios, the what has happened and could have happened, does our life still end in ""what it's destined"" to?!?!",1462665600,4,693,4.864406779661017

It made it artificially more entertaining to keep track of which timeline she was on.  I also forgot how ridiculously pretty Gwyneth Paltrow is, so even if she didn't really have to do terribly much, the other actors who were all very decent just pirouetted around her and finished the film.  At the end I gave it more points because I really did care about what happened more because of the guy than because of the girl.",1462492800,,547,4.797872340425532

I first saw him in Two Weddings and a Funeral and have never been disappointed. The premise of Sliding Doors is slightly far-fetched; for instance what might be the memories of the people around Paltrow and Hanna at the end of the movie? I'll say no more about plot. The concept is interesting, the execution is deft. I willingly suspended disbelief where it seemed called for and was well rewarded for doing that.

It basically shows the parallel lives of Gwyneth Paltrow, two distinct ""possible"" life paths, both fully lived, each separated by a mere second of coincidence because of the ""Sliding Doors"" on a subway... Highly thought-provoking and you really have to watch the movie at least twice to pick up the visual cues used to show her different lives. In one path, she chooses a guy who is a jerk and in the other, a decent guy, but the the true irony of of the story is the ending, where... as real life often is... surprising and unfair...

John Lynch plays a hapless cad, but he is not mean-spirited, and many of the most comedic moments are his.  Despite his actions, he is fun to watch.  This is a highly entertaining and engaging drama with a big message and much heart.

980793,5,6305132143,"I love this movie. It is very interesting to watch the possible effects of missing a train on this woman's life. It speaks to the whole multiverse concept that one reality calves off from a given reality, and that this happens at infinite points in infinite directions. It is difficult to grasp. This movie shows us only two possibilities. Both are excellent stories and character studies. The end is bittersweet. I liked the setting and the camerawork and shot setup. I enjoyed all the acting, which is pretty unusual for me. This is not an exciting movie. It is not a fascinating movie. It is not anything more than a fun premise that was very well put together.

Kudos to cast, crew and writers for taking a ""good"" story and making such a well-done product.

So here's the problem...did you know countries have different codes embedded in their players and dvd codes are made with those codes in order to play.  So I have this lovely romantic comedy that I cannot play because it is zoned for area 2 and the us is area1.  So now I have a lovely keep sake.  So people when you buy DVDs...make sure they are the ones that area compatible with the us players.  That's why I gave it a two...1 for can't play it but 2 stars because I absolutely adore this movie and I KNOW WOMEN WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS MOVIE WILL ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!!!!!,1404604800,,1003,4.252631578947368

981243,4,6305132143,"Ever since Russell T. Davies referred to /Turn Left/ as Doctor Who's ""Sliding Doors Moment"", I have been curious to see this film. Like the Doctor Who episode, the film takes the premise that a small choice can have big repercussions.

Directed and written by Peter Howitt from Bread, the bleachpermed beleathered Joey manages to show that he is capable of more than just a one-note comedy performance. While the scripts seems formulaic at times, it nevertheless has patches of realism, and the characters are made engaging and sympathetic.

The story takes off when a PR girl/waitress/sandwich girl played by Gwynneth Paltrow misses a train and a few seconds later we see what would have happened had she not missed that train. For the remainder of the movie, we cut between the two different universes, the one in which she caught the train, and the one where she didn't. The script was allegedly very difficult for Bickley to write, as he had to keep track of two storylines and two plots running in parallel, and he seems to have done a pretty good job with this.

Gwyneth Paltrow obligingly has a haircut a short way into the film to allow us to distinguish between the two universes. This is the equivalent of Spock's beard in the Star Trek alternate universe. It would have been nice if the two leading men in the film could have had something more to distinguish them, and John Hannah and John Lynch do look alarmingly similar. Maybe Gwyneth just goes for men with menacing eyebrows.

This is a British film with a capital ""B"" as we have Paltrow playing an English woman (and losing her accent quite successfully), Scots John Hannah (star of the Inspector Rubik detective series), and an Irish best mate. Only the lack of a Welsh person prevents our completing the set. The other American star in the film is Jeanne Tripplehorn (whose name makes me think of a triceratops-shaped Swiss mountain) who plays an American, and was no doubt put in to add transatlantic appeal. There is an otherwise illogical reference to the ""Jeopardy"" American game show which seems to show that the American market was at the forefront of Howitt's mind when the film was made.

Lynch's character Jerry also has a jolly cockney best friend, and the two best friends allow the audience to see into the thoughts of the leading characters. A crude device, but it works really well.

The London of the film seems very modern (1998), except that fewer people than in reality have mobile 'phones and people are still using Filofaxes. Still, at least the landline use allows the old ""1471"" trick to be used. The culture of affluence and waste is depicted very accurately, with people buying ready-made sandwiches and eating out every night of the week and drinking expensive alcohol.

At the end of the film, there is a surprising twist as we are treated to a close-up of Paltrow's face and the wig-gauze can clearly be seen. So it wasn't a haircut but a wig all along.

In this there are lessons for us all. Don't steal alcohol from work. Don't be unfaithful. If you're seeing someone who is attached, use contraception, use the old ""141"" trick to prevent their wife/girlfriend finding out who called. And above all, watch out when you cross the road.

A satisfying and funny film, well worth watching.",1401753600,,3283,4.735551663747811

In this one, she deals with two stories ... in one, she comes home to catch her boyfriend boinking another gal .. in the other, she does NOT catch him. The bounce back and forth between the two, until the end ... also unique.  I won't spoil the end for you. All in all, not bad.",1367452800,,559,4.018018018018018

I find that Paltrow has not surrendered to the frothy rom-coms that other grade=A actresses have, but manages to blend a crowd-pleaser with some of the depth of European arthouse films.
I like the fact the the whole movie revolves around the elements of chance, and fate, and treats a difficult but common problem of lovers throughout the ages: the love triangle. Without a doubt, Gwyneth holds the film together, as well as her female rival, while I question that while Gwyenth is trying to act out the part of the every-woman faced with infidelity, she herself is in fact so uniquely a beauty, that I doubt she would find herself in that situation in real life...or at least would have better romantic matches than james or jerry.

The other main male lead has a heavy Scottish (I think) accent, but he is really charming and plays the part so very well.  The difficult task of keeping the two story lines apart and flowing is done very, very well.  One does not get lost due to the craftsmanship of the editors of the film.

983568,4,6305132143,"To start with, anyone who hasn't seen this movie or doesn't know the premise, the plot line alone is enough to pique interest.

Gwyneth Paltrow plays Helen, a PR specialist who starts off her day by getting canned at her job.  Leaving work, she runs to catch a train which she misses, but here is where it gets interesting.  The scene is split in half and for the rest of the movie you follow two scenarios:  what would have happened if she had caught the train, and what happens because she didn't.

It's the classic ""What if?"" that we've all wondered about in our own lives from time to time and indeed this film brings out the best of both worlds.  Another question that it takes a sideways look at is ""Would I have been better off if...?""  And I definitely found myself wondering through the film if Helen really would have had a better life if she had caught that train.  Granted, catching the train opens her up to the extreme emotional horror of walking in on her boyfriend in bed with another woman...missing the train spares her that, but which is really the better way to go?  Or maybe everything really does happen for a reason...

Paltrow gives a superb performance in each scenario (the two are really quite different due to the drastic events).  Her English accent is charming as always.  Jeanne Tripplehorn (`Til There Was You, The Firm, Waterworld) plays Lydia, the former girlfriend of Helen's all-too-adulterous boyfriend, Gerry.  Truthfully, I thought Tripplehorn did a better-than-average job.  From the past roles I've seen her in, I don't think I expected her to be able to pull off such a witchy part so well.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Another face I was surprised to see was John Hannah (Four Weddings and a Funeral) who plays James, a great-once-you-get-to-know-him character, and Hannah fits it well.  Part of what I enjoyed about watching this film was that Paltrow and Tripplehorn aside, there weren't really any faces or names that I recognized...the plot, directing, and acting carry this film rather than big names and faces.  The true test of a good story-line.

I loved this film (definitely a favorite of 1998) and one I keep in my instant queue.",1359590400,,2184,4.715039577836412

If you enjoy movies like ""Happy Accidents"" (2000) that you know the premise of this movie and will enjoy it also. There have been better and worse presentations. This presentation hits the mark.

Helen Quilley (Gwyneth Paltrow) makes it and doesn't make it to the sliding door of the subway. This is where the story split into two parts and we follow each Helen as she is the victim and the master of her fate. Luckily the producers of this film split it into nearly 2 completely different stories so we don't keep seen two versions of the same thing like in the movie ""Run Lola Run."" Notice also that Jeanne Tripplehorn plays an excellent antagonist.

I am sure that you will enjoy this movie. You will find yourself kibitzing. And wondering what would I have done.

983663,2,6305132143,"The writers had a neat enough idea for the movie's premise: how much impact could a split-second difference have on a person's life?

Helen (Paltrow's character), is running late for work and kisses her still-sleeping live-in boyfriend goodbye. She rushes to the office, where she finds out she's being fired. She then heads down to catch the train and, on hearing it arrive, rushes to catch it.

In scenario 1, a little girl gets in her way, causing the doors to close in front of Helen. She goes out to catch a cab and is mugged in broad daylight, causing injury. The cabbie takes her to the hospital, where she spends several hours. She tries to contact her boyfriend Gerry, but he has taken the phone of the hook, lest his adulterous foray be interrupted.

In scenario 2, the girl's mother pulls her out of Helen's way, and Helen forces her way through the closing doors. Helen gets home early. She walks in on Gerry (who has been financially dependent on her as he purportedly works on his novel) in a compromising position with his ex-girlfriend. Helen leaves him.

The rest of the movie alternates between scenario 1 and scenario 2. Through contextual clues and situations (sometimes subtle), you catch on as to which scenario is at play. In both scenarios Helen is portrayed as a weak, confused, and easily manipulated individual. In scenario 1, she remains oblivious that her boyfriend is a slime, despite fairly transparent signals, as she works two jobs to support him. In scenario 2, she has understandably lost a great deal of self-confidence over both losing her job and leaving her worthless boyfriend, but she remains unsure of herself for the balance of the movie.

In both scenarios, she's a victim of deceit, and in both scenarios, she eventually sustains an unfathomably painful outcome. This was downright depressing to watch.

The movie is billed as a ""romantic comedy-drama"". I will say that the standout performance - and my reason for 2 stars rather than 1 - was John Hannah's, as the caring rebound boyfriend James in scenario 2. He provides the sliver of romance that gives poor Helen reason for hope and optimism. But even his character is given hints of a serious character flaw that Helen is forced to confront toward the end of the movie, feeling that her trust in a man has been totally misplaced a second time.

Where on earth was the comedy? If I had had a magnifying glass handy, I would have struggled to find it.

If depressing movies make you feel good, this movie may be your cup of tea. However, if you want a true ""romantic comedy-drama"", this one's falsely advertised... don't waste your time.",1358726400,5,2635,4.737991266375546

This movie is not a romantic comedy, it is a female drama. It has a few humorous lines, but no where near slap-stick. It has an interesting plot. If she catches the train her life goes this way, if she misses the train her life goes another way.

Paltrow is not the best actress out there and is not the absolute prettiest, but she is also not the worst nor ugliest. Her accent in the movie isn't the best, but not the worst fake accent (dialect) I've ever heard in movies. The characters are believable. The whole day that could change everything is a very bad day for her, but the bad day scenario is not overdone (I've had worst days with several bad events - one after another).

I like John Hannah, and I like his character. Once again, he's not the hottest actor, but not the ugliest. He is a pretty good actor and comical.

I think too many people get caught up in the shallowness of Hollywood. I love British and Australian movies because the characters are usually believable, not perfect, photo-shopped, airbrushed clones. But I hear so many complaints emphasizing on the looks of actors/actresses, especially when it comes to British movies.

There's a reason Helen's returning home early; she's been fired from her ""PR job.""  I put that phrase in air quotes because director Peter Howitt hasn't the slight clue what a PR person actually does.  You see, Helen is an attractive, aloof, hard-drinking gal who supports her live-in boyfriend Gerry (John Lynch) while he writes a book.  She has no contacts to speak of -- after being fired she can't find another ""PR job"" - and has no family of consequence.  We know this because she relies exclusively on her best friend Anna (Zara Turner) when she moves out of her apartment. Even when she's in the hospital no family visits her.  Helen is a cypher, a walking piece of cardboard with a British accent.

Her long-suffering boyfriend is so unctuous and passive that he's practically bullied into having an affair with Lydia (Jeanne Tripplehorn).  Lydia, the other woman, is a raving, sadistic psychopath who isn't above openly taunting her unaware rival for Gerry's affections, which sets off another series of mincing, stuttering dialogues from Gerry. Also, her idea of foreplay is spitting brandy into her boyfriend's mouth. About the only character that reacts appropriately is Gerry's best friend Russell (Douglas McFerran), who finds his life choices hilarious.

The other reality turns out a bit better because Helen launches her own PR firm, which consists almost entirely of throwing parties.  She keeps bumping into James (John Hannah), a Scottish bloke that has ""a sense of humor"":  He quotes Monty Python by shouting ""Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!"" even though it's never actually relevant to the conversation.

Sliding Doors concludes with, in no particular order, an elderly mother, a restaurant opening, a tearful argument in the rain, a horrible accident, a surprising revelation, and nurses who freely give out information to anybody who asks even if they're not blood relatives.

And that's the sum of it: Gwyneth Paltrow with a fake British accent in fake relationships generating fake angst. This poorly plotted drek is romance-lite, dutifully hitting all the right beats before clumsily bludgeoning one reality to death and wrapping the other up with a sappy bow.",1334448000,17,2649,5.142191142191142

983771,2,6305132143,"I suffered through this film, and was reasonably glad I did, because the only part I liked was the ending.  I didn't think there was ANY chemistry between Paltrow and the two male leads.  It was almost worth watching to see Paltrow herself- wonderful as always (though playing a largely passive character, and character development was sadly lacking).  But although the writer had an original idea with the premise, and TRIED to craft witty, clever repartee/ dialogue to match, every creak/ contrivance showed and I didn't think there was a real spark, laugh, or moment of authenticity or heart to be found (as in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-View-From-The-Top/dp/B0074298F0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A View From The Top</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/He-s-Just-Not-That-Into-You/dp/B002BBJ52U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">He's Just Not That Into You</a>, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bridget-Jones-Diary/dp/B00ID4HUP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bridget Jones' Diary</a>, for example).  It wasn't for the lack of the actors giving it their all, they tried valiantly to breathe life into the material.  Throughout I just kept thinking how dreary it was.

983774,1,6305132143,"*Author's Note: The slang ""chick"" to refer to a woman is not flattering and is in no way meant to be. I doubt any self-respecting woman wants to be called a ""chick"". Having said that, ""chick flick"" doesn't mean it's a film for women, or insinuate that it's a film only women could enjoy. It's a derogatory word for a shallow, superficial film that caters to a female stereotype, similar in tone to ""a real man's film,"" which would indicate that it's deliberately stupid, i.e. designed to appeal to the idiotic male stereotype; an equally-shallow film meant only to attract the men who would actually use that meaningless term for ""a 'real' man"", which is an intentionally-derogatory term for anything that caters to men who would react unfavorably to being called that. Think of literally any film in which women are portrayed as totally ineffectual or in need of protection by a stronger male, or have no role besides being sex objects--they're impossible to count in modern cinema.*

The premise here is sound, even if it's been done before. Yes, two seemingly innocuous events can lead your life in totally different directions--it's not like film designed this trope, it's been a philosophical topic since practically the beginning of time. The magnitude of something seemingly small such as missing a train can change one's entire life. The premise is right there without ambiguity. The execution, unfortunately, makes it little more than a chick flick with unlikable, shallow characters, none of which any half-human person can sympathize with.

There are some major problems here that deserve mention. First, it takes its initial scenario way too far. Missing the train alone would be enough, but the filmmakers throw in an attempted mugging and a cheating love interest, meeting a new love interest, along with being fired, all in the same day. Really, they just overdo it, for reasons I don't quite understand, because it's not like anyone's missing the point of the film in the first ten minutes. It's like it wants to drive its own message home with poignancy, but in doing so, turns it into a highly unlikely fictional story that just doesn't often happen in real life. Missing a train might make you fail to meet a love interest...OR catch your lover cheating on you...OR ending up in any number of scenarios. But all of these at once? It's just irritating, and makes the whole thing seem trite. The aura reeks of chick flick status, with an ultra-sappy and saccharine atmosphere that never lets up for a second. It's even sappy by chick flick standards, now that I think on it.

If you actually find its artificial meaning poignant, then you've been missing out on what philosophers have been talking about for millennia, or somehow haven't figured it out on your own yet that this kind of thing happens. Yeah, it assumes that life isn't deterministic (in other words, that there is only *one possible path* that could happen), and it doesn't follow a lot of rules of reality that are all hypothetical and largely meaningless and inapplicable to real life. What are you supposed to think by the end? ""Man, if only I'd have had french toast instead of a bagel the day my brother had a car accident, it might not have happened."" Well, sure, in reality, that's not exactly untrue, because it can affect just a few seconds that would cause a split-second event not to happen; no collision, since your brother would be a few seconds later with the french toast. We get it. If you want to repeat this message, this film does a poor job of it, with a saccharine atmosphere and seriously lacking acting jobs, as well as some very serious breaks with reality and extremely unlikely scenarios, even for films with premises like these.

It's just not possible to like this film unless you can get over its shallow characters, saccharine atmosphere, sappy writing, less-than-convincing acting, and basically just utter nonsense to follow a premise that could work if done right, which this film fails miserably at. It just doesn't add up, and in this film, the events adding up is the entire point. It takes a basic philosophical concept and manages to critically muck it up into less than what it originally was--not a good thing for the concept.

My father actually got this film for free from one of his colleagues that liked it, and because I had heard of it and thought the premise was interesting, I decided to throw it in and watch it once. To say the least, I was horridly disappointed with how the premise was pulled off. The writing is awful, the directing is insensible, and no one seems to be trying too hard to make this into the meaningful film someone might have wanted it to be at one point in time. Somewhere along the line (literally), something went terribly wrong, and this film goes into shallow chick flick territory, really fast. Within minutes, you realize this film has no intention of showing you anything beyond its initial ten-minute message that it plays with. After that, it amounts to a romantic wit-fest that doesn't even measure up to Gilmore Girls standards. It all quickly falls apart, and continues to fall apart with every ""twist"" that seem to make less and less sense as they happen, and each scenario as a result of those doors is just too unlikely, even by the standards of the philosophy itself in the real world, to happen as they do here. The result is disastrous, and self-destructs within minutes of the opening credits, before the ashes blow away as the film unfolds into utter nonsense.

Don't bother if you don't like chick flicks. You won't find anything else worthwhile here. If you want to explore the philosophy behind it which is only vaguely touched upon here, look up determinism on Wikipedia, along with all the related philosophies involved. Because the message isn't a new thing, you'd at least expect the film to do it justice. It doesn't, and instead opts to settle for being insultingly shallow and stupid on the level of a sitcom with a poorly-written romance subplot that goes nowhere. If you have the choice behind watching this film or not watching it, let the case remain shut. It's more likely to change your life for the better in the time you're not wasting watching it.",1330041600,6,6241,4.779425393883225

983959,3,6305132143,"This movie contains two parallel stories.  In one story, Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow) catches the subway in time to catch her boyfriend (John Lynch) in bed with his mistress (Jeanne Tripplehorn).  In the other story, the same Helen misses the subway and comes home after the mistress has left.  What happens to each Helen depends on how much information she knows about the cheating.

In the first story, Helen enters a rebound relationship that's supposedly an improvement from her cheating ex, but I saw the two men as the same.  Both men lie to Helen believing lying is a justifiable means to an end.  Also, when the rebound guy (John Hannah) is caught lying, there's a serious hole in his story that Helen dismisses with hugs and kisses.  So, in the end, has Helen really learned her lesson?  It doesn't appear that way.

Nonetheless, this was compelling to watch.  It's interesting that although you have two different stories taking place, you still have the same Helen, with the same hopes and dreams. So like twins separated at birth, these two Helens wind up chasing the same dreams despite their circumstances.  And in case you're wondering if you can tell the Helens apart, you can because early on, one Helen cuts her hair short and dyes it blonde.

As for the acting, I found Paltrow's British accent cringe inducing and her performance flat.  For example, when the first Helen finds her boyfriend in bed with his mistress, I expected anger or sadness but instead, Paltrow looked bored.  She does eventually hit him, but it felt forced.

As for the other actors, Hannah performs well but his thick Irish accent is difficult to understand sometimes.  Lynch overacts to the point where it would be obvious he's up to no good, but Tripplehorn does a decent job playing his demanding mistress.

984129,1,6305132143,"Though the reviewers here seem to have a basically high opinion of the film, I found myself bothered by a lot of things.  Mainly the male POV prevalent throughout that two female characters, presumably both intelligent and attractive, would bother wasting themselves on someone who doesn't deserve their time of day:  namely two-timing boyfriend Gerry, who is living with Paltrow's ""Helen"" while she supports him totally as he is supposedly writing a novel.  Right there, immediately the film came to a grinding halt for me.  I already have to think both Helen and the pre-Helen girlfriend who is back in Gerry's life are self-destructive, low self-esteem types who will take any man on a platter that is given up to them:  This Gerry isn't attractive, either physically or emotionally, to explain away his appeal to these women.  And without some blinding charismatic trait of Gerry's to make this plot seem feasible, this means the screenwriter just has a low opinion of females in general.  Or the male lead was badly cast.  Probably a combination of the two.

And Helen's second romantic prospect isn't that great at final glance either, as it turns out a very important piece of information about him isn't revealed to Helen until near the end of the film, meaning though we're meant to assume he's her knight in shining armor (she needs rescuing from Gerry, at least the screenwriter gives us that) he can be kind of casual in the honesty department.

And Gerry?  In the dual-plot he manages to make both his official and unofficial girlfriends pregnant, meaning he's not likely to be that responsible when it comes to you-know-what.  So he's stupid on top of everything else.

My final dissatisfaction with the film is a general disgust with a certain cliche used in films, that the rebound romance is really the romance you've been waiting for.  The cliche evolved probably to give broken-hearted audience members hope for something better, but in real life, a rebound romance is a needful one, and a part of the grieving/separation process, but a rebound romance that turns to an offical partnership, such as marriage, is nearly always doomed to failure.  But here, in this film, in whichever reality, we're seeing Helen necessarily getting her wake up call and ditching Gerry only to fall immediately into a love affair with James, the not-as-honest-and-sweet-as-we-want-to-think-he-is.  But it's understood in Hollywood parlance that Helen and James will live happily-ever-after - because they were fated, you know?

For a comedy there were very few laughs, in fact I don't remember any.  So perhaps this film is mistakenly labelled as such.  Otherwise, for nitpickers, Paltrow definitely looks better as a sophisticated blonde than as a casual brunette, and there seems to be an extreme shortage of goodlooking men in England.  We really needed Jude Law in this one in order to make it work.  In fact, the male casting could have been Daniel Craig and Jude Law - either man in either part - and it would have worked a lot better, along with a touchup to the script.

Instead of a film, this would have been better as a single episode of a television one hour anthology series.  Because in movie length, it is tiresome.",1211846400,29,3230,4.918819188191882

984131,4,6305132143,"Director Peter Howitt had been a professional actor for over 15 years when he wrote the script for SLIDING DOORS (1998), and it became his directorial debut. I think he understood the creative debt he owed writer/director Krzysztof Kieslowski for the ""concepts"" put forth in his films BLIND CHANCE (1987), and THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE (1991). In BLIND CHANCE we found three parallel story lines having to do with catching, or not catching a train. Ironically, German director Tom Tykwer's RUN, LOLA, RUN (1998) was being developed and filmed simultaneously with Howitt's project. LOLA had three story lines all kicked off by arbitrary actions. So all together now--let's have a tip of the director's beret to Kieslowski.

Howitt as an actor made 27 film appearances from 1982. He was featured in IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER (1993), where he met actor John Lynch, whom he used later in SLIDING DOORS. Howitt had a role in the TV series HIGHLANDER (1993). He was also in SOME MOTHER'S SON (1996), again with John Lynch. He appeared as the ""Cheeky Bloke"" in SLIDING DOORS because suddenly while filming he realized had not cast the part. Since DOORS in 1998), he has directed six films, like JOHNNY ENGLISH (2003), with Rowan Atkinson, and LAWS OF ATTRACTION (2004), with Pierce Brosnan; who by the way had also worked with John Lynch in EVELYN (2003). What a small and tight little world the business of filmmaking can be.

The plot of SLIDING DOORS sets into motion a metaphysical maze. Helen Quilley (Gwyneth Paltrow) has been ""sacked"" from her male dominated PR job. Heading home early she uses the underground. Rushing along we see her miss the train--but then zip-zap the film backs up like a one-reel silent comedy, and then we see her catch the subway. From this point on we start experiencing two parallel story lines with Helen both sitting on the train, and standing forlorn on the platform as the train pulls away.

Helen A., who caught the train, arrived at her flat hoping to get some emotional comfort from her live-in boyfriend, Gerry (John Lynch)--who is being supported by her as he writes his first novel. But she does not find a loving and caring ear for her tale of vocational woe--rather she finds Gerry ""shagging"" a strange woman; who turns out to be named Lydia (Jeanne Tripplehorn). Outraged, Helen A. left the ""wanker"" standing naked, wrapped in a damp blanket, and she headed straight for a pub where she proceeded to get ""drunk as a monkey""--where she is reunited with a chance acquaintance, James (John Hannah). Helen A. moves in with her best friend, Anna (Zara Turner), cuts and dyes her hair blond. Soon her life becomes enriched with her new and wonderful ""independence"".

Helen B., who missed the train, is nearly mugged while hailing a taxi, and has to be taken to the emergency room to get some stitches in her forehead. She arrived at her apartment mere moments after Lydia had exited. Gerry was able to bluster his way through a miasma of lies regarding his activities of the morning, and she decided to believe him. But as the months went on, and she worked two jobs to support him, Gerry continued to cheat on her with Lydia. Finally fatigued waiting for him to leave Helen B., Lydia decided to intervene in their domestic life, demonstrating what a wicked and controlling vixen she really was. There was also the complication of pregnancy in both plot lines--Helen A. by James, and both Helen B. and Lydia by Gerry.

Both story lines proceed toward a tragic denouement. Then miraculously we witness the threads of one life cross over to the other. Perhaps there could have been more of that in this movie. Kieslowski would have allowed more synchronicity to be at work, more instinctual intuitive transfers, and more coincidence. Sometimes director Howitt became so frantic showing us the parallel plots that it became a bit confusing as to which ""dimension"" we were immersed in. Perhaps that is why he had Helen A. dye her hair blond, to ratchet down the possible confusion.

Somehow Gwyneth Paltrow was fully able to develop ""both"" Helens into individual characterizations, Helen A. becoming stronger and more independent, and Helen B. becoming more other directed and gullible. Paltrow's English accent sounded very authentic. This was the first time she attempted that Brit accent, for EMMA (1996), her Oscar for SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE (1998), and her role in POSSESSION (2002) were still projects for her future. In DOORS she reminded me of a young Audrey Hepburn--slim, sexy, and vulnerable. This film was very enjoyable, vintage Paltrow. She actually lives in London now with her musician husband and two children. She can smile  when she reads about herself being referred to as ""that English actress who used to be engaged to Brad Pitt.""",1202947200,3,4783,4.861349693251534

Paltrow does a wonderful job of creating the two different roles, through body language, facial expressions and her gorgeous smile.

The story flounders a bit because of the hapless Gerry, so muddled and weak that it's hard to figure out why two gorgeous women, one Paltrow, the other a beautiful Jean Tripplethorn, are falling all over him.

""Sliding Doors"" is a movie that will, despite some humorous/well-acted scenes, leave you feeling numb and sorry that you have wasted your time. It is a stroy of a beautiful Londoner Helen who, after losing her job and thinking that the day couldn't get any worse, gets to live it twice, in two parallel worlds, both of which start when one Helen manages to catch the train and the other one doesn't. It may seem like an interesting premise, but in reality it falls flat. The makers of ""Sliding Doors"" obviously haven't thought this one out, because as soon as the two stories start overlapping, we are turned off by the lack of anything interesting happening in either of them.

But for some reason I always answer Sliding Doors. It is just so different than any other movie out there and it leaves a lasting impression. It has a Woody Allen feel to it, even if it is set in the UK.

 The plot-here goes. Our main character,Helen played by Paltrow, is a boring British girl who has a lazy boyfriend and is two timing her with a very cranky lady played by Jeanne Tripplehorn. Well one day Helen has a very bad day at work and rushes to catch the train. The movie then explores 2 very different paths, one where she catches the train and other having missed the train. What happens is pure delight. Her world launches into complete opposities of eachother just by the fact of getting home at a certain time. The movie follows the same women on 2 different roads and all comes down to one of the biggest climaxes you can get. Easily watchable again and again.

 It really pays homage to thoes who take a chance on life and aren't affraid to realize that they are worth it. Great supporting cast and a good soundtrack. I mean-look at the cover of the dvd itself- one girl has long hair, the other short and stylish. You know it has to be a ride when even her appearance has changed.

Take the life of an average woman and show what happens if she a) misses a train,  gets mugged waiting for a taxi,  and arrives home well after the departure of the woman her boyfriend is cheating with;  and b) catches the train,  is chatted up by an appealing stranger during the ride,  and catches the cheating boyfriend,  thereby freeing her up to start a new life and date the aforementioned stranger.

  I've read criticisms of the two story lines and of what a difference there is in the two male love interests,  but therein lies the intriguing part of the film.  The brown-haired Helen doesn't catch the cheater in action,  so has no reason to leave the relationship,  even though red flags are raised and she begins to doubt her boyfriend's commitment to her.  The blond haired Helen,  who might not otherwise leave Jerry,  is forced into a place where she has to reinvent herself,  but the benefit is finding James,  who everyone can see is much better for her.

  My main problem with this film is that Lydia,  the ""other woman"",  is such a heinous b**** that you don't really understand Jerry's continued involvement with her.  Had she been a nicer person,  one could better understand his inability to leave her,  but she's so horrid that their shared past isn't enough to account for why he keeps going with her,  especially when he has the sweet and supportive Helen at his side.

  Quibbling over why two American actors play the two main females is silly,  IMO,  they are both wonderful.  Gwyneth Paltrow is so believeable as an English woman that you if you didn't know she was American,  you'd never be able to tell from this movie.  John Lynch is an Irish actor,  if I'm not mistaken,  why not gripe that they didn't choose an Englishman to play Jerry?  Anyway,  all the characters work,  despite their accents and where the actors started out from.

  The ending is chaotic and confusing,  but they both lead to the resolution-lest one think that one Helen is home free and the other Helen got the short end of the stick,  this sudden twist takes care of it.  We are led to believe that Helen ends up with true love in spite of it all.

It is obvious that the British have inherited a lot from their dear Shakespeare. What's more it takes a basket of Britishers to contemplate this sentimental imbroglio of a woman and a man breaking up because of the man's infedility and his inability to assume his second passion from a pure woman's point of view without turning the film into some vengeful proclamation against the sexist nature of the world enslaved by men, the male chauvinistic pigs of today and the fried bacon of tomorrow. And with this light comedy we avoid both the pigs and the bacon. So we get some rather entertaining comedy with a moral : it is up to women to assume their freedom and just grasp it in their own minds for it to become graspable in real life. Slavery is in the mind. The film decides to demultiply the poor girl into at least two beings if not three or four to show how everything revolves around the women's ability to catch an opportunity to be free and to pursue it to its end. Life is a succession of sliding doors in lifts, underground trains and tubes, in the lobby of so many business buildings that you have to learn how to go through them without banging into them or getting squeezed, squelched, squirted and squished between the two sliding leaves, or shouldn't I say leafs, of the door. And here the woman, maybe the women, are becoming pedagogical and exemplary to men and the way one is laminated into oblivion and non-existence, and the other is severely castigated and even slightly whipped into telling the truth. Brilliant in a way even if it is not Romeo and Juliet, but it is definitely better than all the Pretty Women we may have seen and met here and there on some silvery screen.

At this point the film becomes two stories that are simultaneously explored by writer/director Peter Howitt.  In one story, Helen catches the train and arrives home to find her live-in, unemployed, writer boyfriend, Gerry (John Lynch) in bed with his ex-girlfriend Lydia, played by Jeanne Tripplehorn. In the other story, Helen misses the train and arrives back home well after Lydia has left.

Though film critic Roger Ebert thought neither story was strong enough by itself to capture the viewer's attention, this observation, while possibly true, is irrelevant.  This film is two part: what happens when you don't find out about a boyfriend's infidelity and what can happen when you do.

To easily distinguish between the two Helens, Paltrow's appearance is radically altered.  The Helen who doesn't realize her boyfriend is a cheat keeps her brown hair long and mopes around as a lunch delivery girl, wondering why her boyfriend acts so indifferently toward her.  The other Helen, dramatically lightens and cuts her hair into a pixie, meets a charming single man played by John Hannah and embarks on a career as a freelance event publicist.

Without destroying the plot, I will say SLIDING DOORS is the perfect prescription for anyone woman who has a recently gone through a bad break-up.  Proving that living well is the best revenge, SLIDING DOORS is a great choice for a quiet night at home - either alone or with a group of women friends.  But I wonder what the average guy would think of this film.  I would imagine he would feel uncomfortable watching cheater boyfriend Gerry lie his head off and blame Helen when she wonders aloud why their relationship appears to have changed.

984410,5,6305132143,"""Sliding Doors"" isn't your typical chick flick.  Yes, it stars Gwyneth Paltrow and at times in the movie, her character, Helen, has got to be somewhat dimwitted about the flakiness of her jittery boyfriend, Gerry.  What makes this film so fascinating is the concept.

Helen is your (I suppose) typical Brit, living with her boyfriend Gerry in a cozy flat and doing the 9-5.  On this particular day, as she dashes off to work in a mad Monday morning rush, Gerry slips the phone off the hook and jumps in the shower, preparing for a visit from his former girlfriend/current mistress, Lydia.  Bad enough, but it turns out that Helen is currently the breadwinner of this duo, as Gerry is supposedly hard at work on his first novel.

Helen ends up getting fired at work and returns to the tube, to get back home.  This is where the fun starts.  She barely misses the train, leading her to nearly getting mugged on the street, attempting to flag down a cab.  At the same time, we are shown what would have happened had she caught the train.

In the first version, she is taken to the hospital and by the time she gets home, Lydia has safely left the apartment and Gerry is in the all clear.  Helen is forced to get a job delivering sandwiches and waiting tables, while Gerry continues working on his book.

In the second version, Helen walks in on Gerry and Lydia's tryst and unceremoniously dumps him, moving in with her friend Anna.  She makes the acquaintance of James, an utterly charming businessman played brilliantly by the underrated John Hannah and he convinces her to go out into business for herself and also, to get over Gerry.

Without giving too much of the story away, it's interesting how the two very differing paths of version one and two cross each other.  It definitely sends the message that perhaps regardless of which path we may choose, the end result may just be fate.

Ms. Paltrow, as always, is lovely and charming as Helen.  John Hannah seems to steal every scene that he is in, as the humorous James - - where can we find a James of our own???

John Lynch is perfectly nervous and agitated as the cheating boyfriend and Jeanne Tripplehorn is cattily perfect as the bitchy Lydia.

As an additional bonus, the soundtrack is phenomenal!

For a fun and interesting take on your average romantic comedy, definitely give ""Sliding Doors"" a try - - you might find, as I have, that it's worth repeated viewings!",1142208000,,2425,4.582366589327147

the point is not just that a small difference in one's day -- whether one catches a particular 'tube' or misses it -- can greatly impact one's life.  that's the premise for the two divergent stories which are quite unconfusingly presented in the film... but at the end, i was left to thinking the message was something like this:

  each person has a certain potential for career and romantic happiness.  and even though events in one's life might unfold in very different ways depending on the minor details of daily actions and decision-making, one is 'destined' to be given enough time here on earth to realize some of that potential for personal happiness; if, of course, one takes the right chances, has the right luck, and is the gorgeous, graceful gwyneth, crossing paths w/the charming john hannah!

this message might be pure bollocks, but i think it's a nice one; and we don't always watch films to be faced w/reality, right?

Me, I watch Sliding Doors.  It's like curling up with tea and a blanket on a cold rainy day.  It's a good ""comfort"" movie.

Helen (Paltrow) catches a train, comes home and finds her boyfriend in bed with Lydia (Tripplehorn, who is excellent in this).  Or, she misses the train and doesn't find out.  The movie shows us both scenarios.

What's  interesting to me is that I can find sympathy for all the main characters.  Obviously we're supposed to sympathize with Paltrow, but it seems like the director made an effort for us to feel for everyone.  Though there's a lot to dislike about Jerry (her old boyfriend), he does seem caught between the two women (there's a scene with his mate in the bar where his friend says, ""you've told me you're not cut out for infidelity and you wish you hadn't started up again with Lydia,"").  He seems trapped by indecision.  And Tripplehorn, while totally over the top (and more than a little crazy in her actions), really wants Jerry to commit to her.  She seems more frustrated than anything else, and keeps trying to push him to make a decision.  But the movie is absolutely stolen by John Hannah, who plays Paltrow's new love interest.  He's just utterly fantastic and I smile every time he's on screen.

The film switches back and forth between the two worlds - one in which she missed the train, the other in which she caught it.  Despite the frequent switching, the different worlds are skillfully kept clear to the viewer.

The movie raises questions throughout - would it have been better to have caught the train or not?  Is it better to know or not to know?  How much control do people have in the events that shape their lives?

Gwyneth is great in this, although shockingly skinny, and she's perfected the English accent (now try a Scottish one dear), which is probably the reason why she's been in quite a few similar movies. (Shakespeare In Love, Emma) It's faultless, although at some points, it does appear as if she's speaking slower, just to make sure she gets it right.

The only quibble I have about this movie is the timeline, everything seems to happen really quickly. It can get quite confusing some points. When James & Helen have a milkshake together, he asks her to go to a boat race two weeks on Saturday. Then between the milkshake, and the boat race, he asks to go to dinner with him tonight. Then he encourages her to start her own business, then following the boat race, she offers with that guy's restaurant opening in 6 days, and her business seems to be well on its way. It seems like only a month if that has passed between the milkshake and the opening of the restaurant. Then Gerry phones, and Helen tells her friend that two months ago she wanted to Gerry to show up, and it was James, and now she wants James to phone and Gerry phones. And don't even get me started on the pregnancy thing. It seems like only a wee while passes since she & James sleep together, to her realising her period is late, and doing x amount of pregnancy tests. The pregnancy thing seems to be worst in the timeline aspect of things - it just doesn't seem possible. It would be nice to have a commentary on the DVD (rather than none at all), with the director, to see whether he/she made a balls up with the editing, and really, more time has passed than we're shown.

I really didn't like Jeanne Tripplehorn's character in this, until you walked out on Gerry towards the end. I know it's a really nasty thing to say, but in the first shot of her in this, she looks really masculine! I remember the first time I ever saw this, thinking she had a five o'clock shadow, and it still gives me the creeps seeing it now. I don't know whether it's the angle of the shot or what, but she does NOT look feminine at all - yet she does in the rest of the movie. Sometimes I think it's her eyebrows. Am I the only one that's noticed this?

This is a great twist on the rom-com fairytale, and really interesting too. But not the least bit confusing as some reviewers have mentioned. I do admit to having a preference to Gwynnie with the longer hair, the short blonde haircut is just a bit too harsh for my liking. But a rewatchable movie that doesn't grow old.",1111968000,,2756,4.32495164410058
984475,4,6305132143,"It's a little confusing now and then, sometimes hard to keep track of the two parallel scenarios that form the unique and ambitious framework for this, um, I guess you'd have to call it a romance. Here's the deal: Gwyneth Paltrow experiences 2 possible outcomes as a result of her attempt to catch a train (the Tube; it's London) home. In one, she catches the train, arrives home hours early, and discovers her live-in boyfriend in bed with another woman. In the 2nd scenario, she misses the train, arrives home a bit later, and finds her boyfriend in the shower but a few things are awry that arouse her suspicion.

Really promising idea, and the film carries them both all the way to the conclusion and manages to meld them nicely at the end.

The only glitch - well, there were 2, actually - for me was that I had trouble visualizing Paltrow's character seriously falling for the total schmuck/cad/cheating boyfriend and being so undone when the romance faltered. And the other was about an accident scene that occurs very close to the end. It was all filmed so quickly with the 2 scenes occurring simultaneously that just 10 minutes after the film ended, I couldn't remember exactly what had happened in which version.

However, that's minor. It's definitely worth watching. I just hope Paltrow gains about 5-10 pounds pretty soon, tho, cuz her ridged and bony chest is just too anorexic-like to look at without cringing.",1106352000,14,1425,4.761133603238866

984602,4,6305132143,"I actually passed on seeing ""Sliding Doors"" several years ago because of a review I read by Roger Ebert. I knew about the basic premise of the film, which is that a character played by Gwyneth Paltrow gets on a subway train and does not get on a subway train. The film goes back and forth between the two plotlines, basically playing out both sides of Robert Frost's two paths diverging in the woods. Ebert's complaint was that taken independently neither of the plotlines was worth watching, which was enough to convince me to see something else.

 Well, now I have seen ""Sliding Doors"" and while I agree with Ebert's critique, I want to argue that what is interesting about this film is not the two plotlines but the way they interact. Think of it as two wrongs making a right or the total effect being greater than the sum of the two parts or whatever makes sense to you. Writer-director Peter Howitt makes ""Sliding Doors"" into more than just a gimmick film. It is not in the class of ""Groundhog Day"" or ""Memento,"" but it is certainly on a level with ""50 First Dates.""

 Paltrow plays Helen Quilley. One morning she goes off to work, leaving behind her lover, Gerry (John Lynch). As soon as she gets to work she is sacked. On the way home she both catches and misses the subway in a sequences that is rather clumsily staged, but you get the idea. The Helen on the subway gets home in time to catch Gerry in bed with his supposedly ex-lover, Lydia (Jeanne Tripplehorn). The Helen who misses the subway gets hurt when her purse is stolen and gets home after Lydia has left and therefore knows nothing about the affair.

 Because of the near mugging Howitt is able to have one Helen look different from the other because of a bandage on her head after the hospital visit. By the time that heals the other Helen, trying to put Gerry behind her, has shortened her hair and bleached in blonde. The other key distinction is that while one Helen is still with Gerry, working two jobs in order to support him while he (does not) write a novel (and does continue to see Lydia), the other is seeing James (John Hannah), a nice man she met on the subway home and who believes the Monty Python line ""Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition"" helps to put life in perspective (which is certainly true).

 It seems fairly obvious that both Helens should be with James and leave Gerry far behind, but it seems clear that Howitt is going to work the irony angles as much as possible in this film. It is not so much that these are parallel stories as their are recurring elements of symmetry and at some point I decided that what was going to happen here was that Howitt was going to be able to have his cake and eat it two. This indeed turns out to be the case, but telling you that does not give away the end game.

 Paltrow is fine in the main role, although why the two main female characters had to be played by American actresses is beyond me. Tripplehorn's character is in the ""Fatal Attraction"" mold, which makes Gerry's inability to choose between Helen and Lydia rather laughable, a fact repeatedly pointed out to him by his friend, Russell (Douglas McFerran) at the bar. Russell has the best lines in the film, calling Gerry ""a morality-free zone"" and pointing out that his advice will be unappreciated since it is based in reality. Lynch manages to play Gerry so that there is some hope of redemption and we remain open to the idea that things could work out between him and Helen, while we wait for Helen to catch up with our feelings for Hannah's character, who is likeable in a rather surprisingly unpretentious way for such a gabby guy.

 This is not a brilliant and creative film, but Howitt constructs what I think is a smart story line bouncing back and forth between the lives of the two Helens. There is no profound point to be made in the end beyond the ancient idea that when it comes to the lives of human beings and their attempts to find love in the world the gods tend to look down and laugh. But in a world where so many films are exercises in stupidity and I find myself thinking that what ended up on screen was a first draft that needed some serious work, ""Sliding Doors"" has all the pieces fit. The other film I have seen by Howitt, ""Antitrust,"" was also smartly crafted, although in that one somebody else wrote the script.

Paltrow plays Helen, depressed because she's just been fired from her job, heading into the Underground in London to get the train home. She may or may not make her train, depending on whether or not a toddler gets in her way as she's dashing down the stairs. If she makes the train, she'll be just in time to catch her cheating boyfriend in the act and she'll dump the creep once and for all. If she doesn't, he's off the hook and he'll keep on stringing her along.
""Sliding Doors"" plays both sides of the story; we see Helen walking in on her boyfriend and his other woman in her own bed; ditching him and the wretched life she leads with him, finding a new job as a publicist and a new love in James, a handsome young man with a secret of his own. Again, we see Helen missing the train, coming home minutes after her boyfriend has gotten his ""other"" safely out of the flat he shares with Helen (and which, incidentally, Helen is paying the rent on), and continuing her drab ""plain Jane"" existence working part-time in a sandwich shop. Not until near the movie's end do we find out if Helen missed her train or not.
Paltrow is excellent as both halves of Helen, and John Hannah is very good as James. I especially liked Jeanne Tripplehorn as the other woman, Lydia, lonely and vulnerable under all her pseudo-sophistication, who finally takes matters into her own hands when Gerry refuses to fall off either side of the fence.  But the big laugh in this film is John Lynch as Gerry, the no-good louse who cheats on Helen and Lydia while he lives off both of them. Gerry is such a whining creep that his best friend laughs in his face as he relates his tale of woe; he wants it both ways and the world is unfair because he can't have his cake and eat it too.

I don't want to give away the ending, but anyone whose seen it understands what I'm saying. This movie is amazing and deeper than people give it credit for because it is a lighthearted comedy. It can make you think, and overthink every decision and step you take every day, because you just never know where you're being led... but in the end you'll end up on your destined course and if someone's meant to be in your life... it's inevitable, one way or another it will happen.",1074124800,14,858,4.35625

In the alter version she catches her train, meets John Hannah (movie nice guy) and gets home to find John Lynch (Gerry) her jerk boyfriend in bed with his bit on the side (English expression).  Gerry is an awesome character, a totally loathsome whining toad that you just love to hate.
The two plot versions run in parallel throughout the movie, but due to different hair styles for Helen it is a simple matter to follow along without getting a migrane.  I must warn you that there is a twist at the end that you may not like as it differs from the usual R Comedy formula.
Cast performances are really good, Paltrow does a creditable British accent, which is important to me being a Brit. Hannah is great as always and I thought John Lynch was excellent.

Ever wondered what your life would be like if you made just one choice differently? Branching off from one single event (a parent pulling a little girl out of a woman's way on the subway), Helen's life is drastically changed. In one scenario, she stays with her two-timing boyfriend (who is an absolute jerk, but manages to come off as slightly charming), and in the other, she meets a new man named James (John Hannah, in my favorite male hero character ever!). The movie is funny and cute, and manages also to be terribly interesting - the viewer watches the two universes travel farther and farther apart, wondering how the director will bring the two universes back together. He successfuly does so, in a surprising and bittersweet finale that leaves the viewer uncertain whether to cry or cheer.  This is one of those great, rare movies that manages to be deep as well as entertaining, and I give it my highest reccommendations.  Well done!",1057536000,7,1099,4.871657754010696
984707,5,6305132143,"Sliding Doors is the 1998 Gwyneth Paltrow vehicle based on the alternate reality theme originally explored in the 1982 Polish film ""Blind Chance"" and 1998's Run Lola Run.  After viewing some of Paltrow's lesser works I wasn't expecting much with this one, so it pretty much took me by storm.  Paltrow solidifies herself here as an American honorary Brit and interestingly some not so covert swipes are taken at American culture (John Hannah's references to Seinfeld, Baywatch, David Cassidy, etc.)
  So Paltrow as Helen just misses the tube...and just makes it, and we see both realities play out with interspersed editing.  Where she misses it we see her life seemingly sliding downhill rapidly, whereas where she makes it apparently on the upswing.  She has a boyfriend in Gerry (John Lynch) who's cheating with an intentionally annoying American (yet another swipe at Americans), but catching the tube allows her to meet James (Hannah) who's Scottish humor is contagious, and find out Gerry.  While missing it she has only suspicions of Gerry while she works 2 jobs to support his non-existent novel writing and snowballing of lies about his fidelity.
  And there is an interesting double-twist ending which I won't devulge, but suffice it to say both realities intersect in interesting ways and it's hinted at that they have some kind of pull on each other; i.e. her missing the tube one has her imagining and regretting not having a better reality (the catching the tube one).

She does produce a good English accent, but at times it sounds far too posh and 'put on'. I suppose only Brits will pick up on that!

984794,4,6305132143,"This sweet-natured romantic comedy may be little else but it's got several key ingredients that make it definitely worth a look.  The neat little story has Helen's life split in two, one where she catches the train and gets home to find her boyfriend having an affair, the other where she misses it and continues living with him.
Gwyneth Paltrow has never been so endearing (and no-one has ever pulled off a British accent so convincingly), and knows how to play the audience well as we're rooting for her from the very beginning.  She's downtrodden yet resourceful as we see in the two plots.  The slapstick comedy from her husband as he's desperate to keep the affair secret maintains a light air despite more complicated issues that arrive with Helen.  Whilst in the other story Helen meets a nice Irish bloke (Nesbitt), has a new haircut and is generally happy.  Okay, so this isn't anything new but the director manages to run the two stories alongside each other effortlessly and it's so cutely funny that it's hard not to be taken in, especially when all the romantic plots are underlined with an essential humour.  What is most surprising about this movie though is the ending, which will certainly shock its audience with its sheer difference to most romantic comedies.  It's a brave move, yet `Sliding Doors' manages to pull it off.  This is one of the best romantic comedies that I have ever seen.",1016668800,3,1408,4.741803278688525
984795,4,6305132143,"I truly enjoyed this sweet and unique film from Britain. It is a charming and thoughtful portrayal of a young woman named Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow)who is fired from her job, and finds parallel destiny in the doors of a subway train. It is a story of destiny, and how we can never truly escape what we are meant to do, even if we are going in completely opposite directions.
In one version, Helen misses the train, is mugged, goes home to her boyfriend Gerry (John Lynch) who has just finished an afternoon delight with his ex-girlfriend Lydia (Jeanne Tripplehorn). She then begins a series of menial jobs, unaware that her boyfriend is cheating on her. In the version where she makes the train, she meets the charming James (John Hannah) and returns home to find her boyfriend in the throes of passion with Lydia. She leaves him, moves in with her best friend, starts her own business, and begins a loving relationship with James. We see these two versions, and think we know which direction they are going...but it's destiny, after all, and nothing is quite that simple.
Gwyneth Paltrow is wonderful as usual, doing her British accent in between 'Emma' and ""Viola"". Her eyes become big as saucers when she is hurt, and she can express more emotion in a twitch of her face than many actresses can with their whole bodies. John Hannah is wonderful as James, the charming, kind, sweet man of most women's dreams, but still with his faults. I wish John Hannah, and this film for that matter, were more successful. I had never watched the film before, I had neglected to rent it many times, because I wasn't completely ""aware"" of the film. I regret not seeing it sooner. I cried my eyes out at the end, although I am a bit emotional. It is life seen from a different eye, and I highly recommend it.",1014076800,2,1792,4.568322981366459
984796,4,6305132143,"THE ACTING WAS GREAT, THE STORY A BIT ONE SIDED:
Gwyneth Paltrow and Jean Tripplehorn do an excellent job pulling off duel roles for the same character in this romantic/comedy/drama. The leading men are equally charming in both their particular ways. (Tongue in cheek here).  The story line is creative as well, but more could have been done a little less extremely.  The characters are very one-sided and could have been more creatively handled.
BASIC IDEA, WE ALL WONDER WHAT IF:
How many times do we have an opportunity to have an insignificant event play an important point in our life, that we don't even realize the significance.  This was the fundamental thrust in the movie.  Timing.  What forces out there guide (or not) our lives?  How much is chance and how much is destiny? If you believe the director/writer in this story, only one path works.  This was the part I didn't like.
BASIC STORY:
Gwyneth Paltrow's character is involved with a two timing boyfriend, who's lack of character and overbearing mistress dominate both their lives.  Due to a minor change in timing one version takes Gwyneth's character out of his life.  In the other scenerio, she falls prey to her unconfirmed doubts.  Both of their lives continue and the story ends at another crossroads.  I can't say more without giving it away.  However, I think the director, could have handled it a bit more creatively and even handedly.
DARK VERSUS LIGHT:
The comedy is dark in some situations as you see how manipulated and domineered Gwyneth's character becomes by her situation, while remaining in the louse of a boyfriend's life.  Ironically, the darker scenario, her hair is dark.  And the lighter (kind of) scenario, her hair is light. In this situation once she gets on with her life with another man, the comedy is light and whimsical.  A bit too obvious however.  The drudge versus the successful working woman
HATED SOME OF THE ENDING:
The only major flaw I find in the movie is the ending.  This was a bit too much.  Is this the directors punishment for all the strong determined woman out there, who have dumped their louses?  What were you thinking?  Shame on you.
It was an interesting movie that was at time a bit predictable at times but enjoyable none the less.  One wonderfully hysterical part of it was the dialogue between Jerry and his (sympathetic?) mate at the bar.  How many louses expect sympathy for their situation.  This guy was for real.  Also, the British humor was wonderful.  What does bollux mean?",1013904000,5,2505,4.783216783216783

And then, rewind, she catches the train. What insues is a delightful, unique, and surpisingly deep film about what her life is like traveling down the two different paths. On one hand, she has lazy, scummy boyfriend Jerry, who you somehow can't help liking at least a little bit (at least, you never hate him as much as you'd like to). He's a great comic presence, confused and trying to do the right thing, but keeps tripping over his own self-indulgent feet. On the other hand, you have John Hannah's character, a good-hearted and hilarious bloke who's original and quite cute. The way Helen reacts with others in a scene is wonderful.

984883,4,6305132143,"This offbeat gem of a movie will surprise even those of us who thought Gwyneth Paltrow is all legs and hair and precious little talent.  I know it did me.  I won't rehash the plot again, except to say that the ""What if I had ONLY caught that train?"" scenario is something we've all experienced and wondered about at one point or another.  London career gal Helen gets to experience both possibilities, with hilarious and touching results.  Ms. Paltrow turns in a winning, subtly nuanced performance in her dual role as Helen-Who-Makes-the-Train, and Helen-Who-Doesn't, making herself likeable enough in both scenarios that we root for her in both 'lives'.  Despite some lapses into superficiality, the script keeps us guessing how things will turn out for Helen--in fact, what appears to be the 'ideal' scenario at first is shown to be not so ideal at all.
Two things make this movie worth viewing a second time--the glimpse it provides into the lives of contemporary London 'singletons', which is always intriging to this Anglophile, and John Hannah in the role of James, Helen's love interest in her 'alternative' universe.  First encountered by Helen, and the audience as a persistently chatty fellow passenger on the Tube, he quickly wins Helen's heart, and the audience's with his warm and endearing teddy-bearish decency, his quirky and appealing looks, and The Accent, a Scottish brogue so thick as to be nearly impenetrable at first to Yank ears, but which soon becomes addictive.  'Sliding Doors' is just that much better when Hannah is on-screen, and he and Paltrow make an appealing, if unlikely couple--the Golden Hollywood It-Girl paired with a clownishly attractive regular Joe.  The same formula was used in 'Notting Hill', but unlike the sterile screen pairing of Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant in that film, Paltrow and Hannah do achieve a real, quirky chemistry together that makes the romance believable.
Fans of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" will recognize Hannah--he gives a charmingly different performance here as a romantic leading man.  Here's hoping he can follow in the footsteps of his countryman Sean Connery and snag some more juicy leading parts in America that will display The Accent to full advantage!",991267200,5,2233,5.079234972677596

And how will Helen handle it? The results are tender, amusing, and interesting.

Well in this beautiful romantic comedy starring Gwenyth Paltrow and John Hanna, that simple question is the primary focus of the story.  When Helen, played by Gwenyth Paltrow, misses the train going home her life takes an amazing change in course by showing her life as it would have happened if she caught the train. Athough it sounds confusing in text, the movie clearly presents Helen's destiny one two seperate diverged roads. The symbolism of Helen's two new characters signify how singular events can permanently alter your life forever.  John Hanna plays James, the nicer of Helen's boyfriends. Although he is the typical flat male charachter in romantic movies, the viewer never seems to tire of his ""cheesiness."" He cheers Helen up by quoting Monty Python, ""Nobody expects the Spanish Inquistion."" This also is significant towards the movie's story since it focuses on how nobody can truly expect how their life can change in a split second.  Since I don't want to give away the ending I can only tell you that it, in my opinion it symbolizes fate better than I have ever seen before.  This movie brilliantly shows us the meaning of life, fate, destiny, and love.

984986,4,6305132143,"Gwyneth Paltrow has long been one of the few American actresses who can perfectly mimic the British accent. We saw this in `Emma', and we now witness her excelling at this particular talent in `Sliding Doors', one of the most thoughtful English films to come out in the last decade. I first saw this film a few years ago upon initial release, and was both impressed and intrigued by the director's style of film-making. Rarely have there been good films that weave alternating storylines convincingly, and to do it when the characters in both storylines are the same person must have been a task indeed. But on every imaginable level, `Sliding Doors' is a respectable success, moderately successful in some areas and hugely in others.
Much of this is due to the presence of Gwyneth Paltrow and John Hannah. I have never really liked Gwyneth in her screen performances (I thought her Oscar should have actually gone to Cate Blanchett), but she managed to endear herself to me in this movie. This is due to the intelligent script and the quaint London setting, I suppose, but is also owed to Gwyneth's smouldering chemistry with the lead actor (little known John Hannah, who was also the gay lover in `Four Weddings and a Funeral'). He has always been a rather reclusive actor and this film remains his only real foray into mainstream cinema as a leading man (he did play Rachel Weisz's brother in `The Mummy' but no one remembered his role there).
The story is simple enough. Gwyneth lives with her aspiring writer boyfriend in a downtown apartment. Unbeknowest to her, he is having an affair with an American executive who works in England (played by Jeanne Tripplehorn, who gets all the bitchy lines). One day, after being fired from her job, Gwyn returns home through the metro rail network. The story splits in two here. On one hand we learn of Gwyn's life if she catches the train on time and therefore reaches home in time to find her cheating man in bed with someone else. And on the other, the story deals with what happens if she didn't catch the train and thus reached home late, completely ignorant that her boyfriend's lover has managed to leave before her arrival. This is all brilliant fun, but also soaked in spiritual tones that never get too preachy or boring. A film like this can only work if the leads are convinced of the storyline and the characters they are playing. On those counts, `Sliding Doors' is a resounding success.
I particularly liked the way everything came together in the end. Perhaps the message was that you can't cheat destiny or escape from what will eventually happen to you. Luckily for us, the film also suggests that everything that happens to you is good and should be welcomed. I thought this was masterfully brought across. On VHS, this film looks dull as the colors sometimes blend into one another and the sound isn't exactly praiseworthy. Still, it's a worthy buy, as this is the best of British cinema, and is one of those rare gems that don't come by that often. Highly recommended.",981590400,4,3034,4.704887218045113

984988,4,6305132143,"Two things are essential if you want to watch this movie.  One, you have to like Gwyneth Paltrow, because you're going to see a lot of her; and two, it helps to be a girl.  Since I only half qualify I am not the best audience for this corny, but clever, three-quarters cute, romantic comedy.  Most of it is standard faire: London girl Helen (Paltrow) has to choose between puppy-eyed loser Gerry (John Lynch) and Good Guy James (John Hannah).  Circumstances make the Good Guy look bad while the puppy-eyed loser pouts real well and looks emotionally helpless, so it's tough on our good girl, who's kind of like a Brit Mary Tyler Moore for the nineties.  But ""she's gonna find true love.""  Count on it.  It's just that there's an hour and a half of misdirection before she does.
Paltrow isn't able to display anything close to her full range here, even though the film amounts to a vehicle for her.  The clever plot idea is to show her life under one set of circumstances (she misses the train and doesn't meet James) and ""a road not taken"" (she catches the train and does meet James) in alternating cuts.  Surprisingly it works fairly well.  To keep us from getting confused, her hair goes short and blonde in one set and long and dark in the other.  I like her better with dark hair.  She looks more glamorous.  I was surprised to notice that back-to-back adoring reviews on Amazon were written by eleven and twelve-year-old girls.  When I think about it, that's kind of nice, since this is a sweet movie and those tough little critics are an appropriate audience (along with me, I guess), and this is an advisory tale about the nature of men, illustrating that you have to be careful about whom you choose when you're following your heart.
Most fun in the movie is the dirty deeds done by Lydia, (Jeanne Tripplehorn) Helen's rival for Gerry.

I've seen this extremely funny and intelligently romantic movie about a dozen times after seeing it in the theater (and that's for  lack of time) and I'm still not bored with it. I've shown it to people of  all ages and both sexes and they all loved it. The ""What if she had  caught the rain?"" becoming reality principle is not plausible of  course but the rest of the movie is extremelly realistic.
Gwyneth is  absolutely perfect, John Hannah delivers more one-liners than you could  think of and yet never sounds contrived, his total lovability and his  accent turn him into this so obvious babe.  Jeanne Tripplehorn is cast in  this very unrewarding role, yet -in one very memorable monologue  especially- she manages to give it more than one ""evil""  dimension. In fact, all supporting roles are extremelly well-crafted and  allow the movie never to see its pace slow down.
I should add that the  first time I saw it I was wondering how the story would fall back on its  feet in the end and I was so pleased to see how they had dealt with it.  Thumbs up ! and thank you for this little gem.",966556800,45,1109,4.415841584158416

The film is a brilliantly executed ""what-if"" scenario, played out  by the chief agent, Helen (Gwenyth Paltrow) and centers around one  particular instant that spurs off two distinct paths her life could take.  The rest of the film jumps between the two separate life-paths.  The plots  are intertwined not only by sharp coincidences in events, but also through  brilliant cinematography.  The film cleverly entices the audience to feel  pity for Helen's feebleness in one plot; then instantly transforms it to  envy and admiration for her strength in the other.  There are small twists  throughout, and there isn't a single loose end in the entire film.  In the  end, it is both neatly tied up and yet opened to brand new possibities, in  an ending that will leave you with a flow of emotions ranging from hope to  happiness, and even a hint of sadness.  The picture's duality is never  overbearing, and is completed both on it's film, and in the audience.  It's  definitely one of the best films I have ever seen.",959299200,3,1161,4.653465346534653
985071,4,6305132143,"Once again, we have Gwyneth Paltrow delving into the world of the Brits and sporting an English accent in a story where the director's view seems to be that regardless of the circumstances, fate still plays a vital role  in the final outcome. It is an experiment of the rhetoric ""What  if...?"", a splicing of two cells containing scenarios, and their  embryotic outcomes spawning as the film progresses. It begins with our lab  rat (Helen Quilley) leaving her place of employment after she's just been  fired. The cell-dividing begins when she heads for the subway and the two  scenarios are shown consecutively where first she misses the train, and the  second half where she catches it at the last moment. In scenario two, she  arrives home to a cheating boyfriend (a despicable, weak-minded weasel  played convincingly by John Lynch) in mid-coitus with his old lover Lydia,  who is portrayed with amusing fury by Jeanne Tripplehorn. In the previous  scenario, she is forced to walk home after missing the train and is mugged,  taking a trip to the local emergency room and buying time for Gerry (the  cheating boyfriend) to usher Lydia out of the apartment.
Where it goes  from there, the scenarios are easily distinguishable. The jilted Helen  packs her bags and moves in with her feisty Irish girlfriend Anna (great  performance by Zara Turner) and cuts her hair, dying it blonde. She then  attaches herself to a new boyfriend with a thick, Scottish accent free of  fabrication named James (great comedic timing on the part of John Hannah).  Both stories have their similarities, which you will see when watching are  the hands of fate working their magic even though the circumstances are  different.
I have to give a hand to the writers of this screenplay for  the great one-liners that came out of this movie and the overall snappy wit  of each character. You even have your comedy relief in the form of Gerry's  wisecracking friend Russell, played by Douglas McFerran.
This film had a  very good cast and I was intrigued by the premise, but my only problem was  Gwyneth's accent. Yes, she does it better than most, but compared to people  who really did have an English accent, she needs a little more practice  before she can even have Americans fooled. Other than that small detail,  this is a very entertaining and very humorous movie, despite its  surprisingly dour ending.",959040000,4,2386,4.84863523573201

With the exception of Helen and her female friend, all of the  characters were repulsive and had no redeeming qualities. The film portrays  John Hannah's character as 'Mr. Right,' even though he's deceived Helen all  along by failing to mention a certain something about himself (I won't  spoil the ending). Even his explanation doesn't get him off the hook,  because he still lied and deceived her.

John Hannah also creates an extremely likable character, and him  and Paltrow create an amazingly cute couple.

In ""Emma"" and ""Shakespeare in Love"" they were good but then they were the  accents of upper-class aristocrats of yesteryear. Put in a modern,  middle-class scenario and it just comes across as an accent which is mixed,  undistinctive and just plain odd.
However, accent apart I liked Paltrow  in this flick which I must say certainly has an interesting storyline and  is executed in a clever way, avoiding the confusion a storyline like this  could have caused.
But it is patchy. It doesn't seem to move along at a  very even pace and there were points in this film when I was just plain  bored.  In order to make this film a success you need more than just a  curious storyline; the whole film must be pumped with energy and quirks  which, quite frankly, this doesn't have.

Story plays  well on repeated viewings (and one catches all the sublties better).  Gwyneth pulls off the British accent with aplomb (though her's and Hannah's  are rather thick at times so it is great to be able to rewind and get the  pronounciations clearer the second time).

985613,5,6305132143,"First-time Brit director/writer Peter Howitt has given us an intriguing romantic comedy in Sliding Doors, a movie that explores the fascinating concept of fate, and how trivial matters in our daily encountering could  have far more profound consequences in our lives than we realize. The  movie's humor and wit reminded me most of Four Weddings and a Funeral, my  favorite romantic comedy of all-time. Incidentially, John Hannah, who also  appeared in Four Weddings, plays the love interest of Gwyneth Paltrow. They  have a wonderful screen presence together, with a solid supporting cast to  boost. The script is effective in juggling the two paths of Helen's life,  keeping me caring and guessing till the very end.
As with most of  Paramount releases, the DVD is sorely lacking in feature. Given that there  is no extra, I would prefer that the disc would automatically play when  inserted. The default soundtrack of the movie is Pro-Logic, so if you have  a Dolby Digital setup, you would need to make that selection on the menu  each time. The soundtrack options could not be selected during the movie.  With that aside, I am quite pleased with the transfer. The picture is  perfectly matted at approximately 1.85:1. 16x9 enhancement is not available  to widescreen set owners, and while I detest pan and scan format, the movie  would be suitable for those that prefer the format and should be made  available on the unused side. Images are generally sharp, but prone to  graininess at times, mostly on static backgrounds. Also exhibiting are  minor jaggedness on edges and dirt particles on the print. Colors, however,  are striking, with memorable scenes of neon displays inside the small diner  and the picturesque Hammersmith Bridge at night against the twinkling  skyline backdrop. Fleshtones are natural throughout.
The Dolby Digital  soundtrack has a good use for the front channels, but little else for the  surrounds. Occassionally, there are realistic effects of pouring rain and  crowd noise, which are the extended mix for the surrounds. The movie does  have a delightful collection of songs from British bands that lend nicely  to the setting. As for the dialogue, I believe that I read once somewhere  that the movie was dubbed on some prints with a friendlier accent for the  American audiences. Thankfully, this is not the dubbed version, but for the  untrained ears, the British accent could be difficult to understand, with  Paltrow sporting a perfect native accent. In which case, you can always  turn on the subtitles.
