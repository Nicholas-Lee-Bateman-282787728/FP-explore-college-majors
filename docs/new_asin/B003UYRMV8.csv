I don't know if it was broadcast later on Finnish TV and someone video-taped it and sold it, but that's what it seems like to me.  This video is NOTHING like the Dangerous and Bad Tour videos I just also bought and watched - they were great. The sound is so bad on this one whole lines of the music, the multi-layered quality of Michael's music, cannot be heard. You also cannot hear crowd reaction hardly at all in this DVD, not like the other DVDs, crowd reaction that I knew was there to certain moves he would make, or etc., made you feel like you were there- well not in this DVD.  When he brought his YANA girl to dance with, you didn't even get to see where she came from off the stage.  That whole dance is something I really enjoy watching and this video really just didn't do it justice.  This video made me longing to put on the real songs and listen to the full quality of them!  The poor sound also detracted from the drama and emotionalness of Michael's concerts.  He really got his audience involved, and this really minimized it.  Also, the people who filmed this concert, whomever was behind the cameras and etc., some of their camera angles were not good.  Also, a couple times through the video you could see a gray horizontal line go through it, so you know it had to have come from videotape.

Now, regardless of ALL of this, I am keeping this video. Why? I love MJ and know this is a rare concert video. However, I am going to be seeking out official copies of his HIStory tour - amazon.co.uk sells them, I wish amazon.com (USA!) did!  (hint hint amazon.com USA!).

The DVD came in a couple weeks or so, which was slower than the other DVDs I have ordered.  So just know, I am rating this concert video 3 stars only cuz of the poor video and audio quality.  His moves even looked almost slow motion at times, blurred, just poor quality video, period.  Michael himself? He was his hot awesome beautiful sexy self.  RIP MJ",1402704000,,2112,4.324873096446701
