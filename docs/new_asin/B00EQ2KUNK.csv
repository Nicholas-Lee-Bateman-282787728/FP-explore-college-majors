5933969,5,B00EQ2KUNK,What a bargain!  How many times can you get 26 episodes on the same DVD.  Historical value for the younger generation is a definite.  Also would be an appropriate gift for seniors who experienced this first hand.,1418860800,6,212,4.675675675675675

5933974,5,B00EQ2KUNK,"Considering the music used for this series of programs was spectacular... Considering the photography footage was basically live from the battle photographers... Considering that I knew a lady that saw her son's last moments on this earth and couldn't stop watching the series, because she would see her deceased son again if only for that moment... To me, it was WW2 in all it's terror and history and reality...",1399766400,14,413,5.0

5933979,5,B00EQ2KUNK,I used to race home on my bicycle from Boy Scouts meetings in the early 1950s to watch this and the music still takes me back to those days. It was made 7 years after the war so it is not politically correct about the enemy. You should not be PC about an enemy that attacks your country.,1475712000,3,287,3.9655172413793105

5933984,5,B00EQ2KUNK,"My husband bought this after we did a month long trip to Europe on a World War II tour. He watches it all the time, over and over, so I'd give it 5 stars.",1446595200,2,154,3.5588235294117645

5933990,3,B00EQ2KUNK,"Good for what it is, and certainly priced right. I bought it for my 90-year-old dad. I previewed the episodes and picked three that I thought he would be most interested in. There's lots of repeat footage, and you often wonder if what you're seeing onscreen is really portraying what the narrator is talking about or is just some available war footage. Also, there's a good deal of wartime movie footage woven in, and you have to pay attention that in these instances you're looking a dramatizations and not the real deal. Also, the music soundtrack often makes it difficult to hear the narratora bad mix.",1438992000,,605,4.716981132075472
5933991,4,B00EQ2KUNK,A trip back in time seeing this series.  I remember watching it as a child in the 50s.  Richard Rogers' music is haunting.,1437609600,,122,4.260869565217392
5933992,5,B00EQ2KUNK,Saw this documentary when it aired on television in 1952. It is one of the great documentaries of WWII.,1437004800,,103,4.473684210526316

5933999,5,B00EQ2KUNK,excellant.,1433289600,,10,10.0
5934000,5,B00EQ2KUNK,"To start off with, I remember watching this as a child. My father loved this show, and he loved the soundtrack, and as a result, so do it. Still have the original soundtrack albums. The songs "" Beneath The Southern Cross"" and ""Guadalcanal March"" are worth the listen.

The show itself was done in the fifties, not that far removed from the war itself. ""The Greatest Generation"" was riveted to it on their black and white TV's..ours was. The narration is stirring, they used actual footage throughout, and its episode sequence built up to the finale.

If you wish to expose children or teens to the history of this time, this is a great way to expose them to the feel of the time. This and the other excellent series ""The World At War"" are excellent ways to do that. This is highly recommended, and at this price, you simply cannot go wrong.

I while back, I got this as presents for my relatives, (father, uncles), and they were astounded. At $5??? No better gift for those who lived it.",1432512000,4,987,4.472222222222222

5934004,5,B00EQ2KUNK,"Probably the best series ever done about war and the terrible effect it has on the human spirit. It also proves how the ""Greatest Generation"" proved it's worth",1430006400,,159,4.714285714285714
5934005,5,B00EQ2KUNK,This DVD set was for my husband for his birthday.  He use to watch this show when he was younger.  He just loves it.  Just as he remembered it.  It also replaced the VHS tapes that he had which made a lot of room for other things.,1429747200,2,230,3.8297872340425534
5934006,3,B00EQ2KUNK,"The 2nd disc of ""Victory at Sea"" was corrupted. Parts of it could not be viewed..",1429660800,4,81,4.125
5934007,5,B00EQ2KUNK,great collection of the old series,1429142400,,34,4.833333333333333
5934008,4,B00EQ2KUNK,"excellent but since it was released 7 years after WWII it is propaganda but provides material not found in other documentaries.  Great score by Richard Rogers.  Great for WWII collectors but you need to add other documentaries to expand on specific battles.  Check out World At War a 1974 British 26 hour documentary, another great series.",1427932800,2,339,5.017857142857143

5934010,5,B00EQ2KUNK,"A monument to our Navy in WW2.  Should be required viewing for every American high school student.  I believe it is for cadets at the Naval Academy.

5934011,5,B00EQ2KUNK,"This was the first of the WWII documentaries, a series of 26 episodes covering all theaters of the war.  The emphasis is on the part played by the U.S. Navy, although all services are recognized.  WWII was so vast in scope, it is almost impossible to cover at one time, however this series makes a valiant effort.  The war was truly world-wide.  It was released in the early 1950s, while remembrances were fresh, and consists almost exclusively of actual films of battles and activities related to the war.  Although, for the most part the episodes are in chronological order, attention must be paid to the dates noted by the narrator, as some featured events occurred simultaneously.  Classic music, composed for the series by Richard Rodgers.  Overall, well done, highly recommended!  Shows the war the way it was.  I know, I was alive during that period of history.",1425686400,13,868,4.850340136054422

8608331,4,B00EQ2KUNK,"I ordered the series because I remembered watching it on TV in the fifties.  Watching it again was so uplifting about our Military; we're still the greatest.  I will share it with family and friends, many of whom have no concept of what it means to have a ready Military.  May they reflecton the importance of keeping our Military at the ready now.
