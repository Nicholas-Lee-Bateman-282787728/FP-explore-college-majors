8715486,5,B00X99RNH2,"If you are a casual film goer, avoid like the plague. If you have seen these before, especially as a preteen like I did, they will at least bring nice childhood memories. Scooter McRae tells a story about watching Hell of the Living Dead much like my own. Even though there was a noticeable sign written in sharpie on fluorescent cardboard right by the box office that read ""Adults Only,"" the guy behind the window didn't even pay attention to me and, once inside, I noticed there is NOTHING but kids my age in the theater! Joe D'Amato and his ""Filmirage"" crew where out just to make a living from cheap movies that would guarantee some sort of return, investing the least possible money or effort. Like Enzo Castellari once explained, their pitcher for the American drive in market was the cover art, which, telling by most of the heartbroken reviewers, still works every time, even though these days is easy to see references and ratings to almostl every film in existence online. You have to appreciate their ""craft"" for what it is and not measure it by Hollywood standards. While Metamorphosis is a somewhat blatant rip off of the Fly with elements from films like Altered States thrown in for good measure, Beyond Darkness is the fifth unofficial Italian sequel to the Evil Dead in name only, featuring Gene Le Brock from the previous film and the great Michael Stephenson from the ""apple of discord"" mega-cult hit Troll 2. Directed by the same guy who brought it upon us, the back of the cover reads, after stating this hard fact, ""...so, you know it's good!"" And indeed, if you know what you are getting into, you know you've got to have it no matter what... If you liked the outrageousness of his previous movies, the WTF twists, convoluted plot lines, the frantic pace, the ""I never knew what hit me"" feel, the visual ""flare""  and, of course, the almost total lack of production values of his previous works, I guarantee you will be handsomely rewarded.  Shout! Factory, as far as I know, is a ""nostalgia"" brand. Joe D'Amato was probably the cheapest, stingiest and most unpretentious movie businessman in history. Claudio Fragasso is the guy behind Troll 2. I mean, people should know better than this...",1531440000,,2214,4.718346253229974
8715487,1,B00X99RNH2,"Save your money, both films are terrible & NOT IN A GOOD WAY. I could not wait for both of them to end. I usually love 80's horror/sci-fi flicks but these are just plain bad. These are coaster material or trash landfill, don't be fooled by the cool cover art.",1468022400,,259,4.2
8715488,2,B00X99RNH2,"METAMORPHOSIS: extreeeemely boring man-turns into-lizard thing, with lame FX and a plodding ""story"" that I promise you will NOT care about... the only reaction it stirred in me AT ALL was in the the last couple minutes with some blatantly, hilariously cheap creature shots in what could generously be referred to as the ""finale"".

BEYOND DARKNESS: more hokum, this time of the Italian EXORCIST rip-off variety... a little better & slightly more imaginative than METAMORPHOSIS... but that ain't saying much.

Scream! Factory frequently does a great job with special features that can add to the appreciation of these little niche/obscure, throwaway, Z-grade numbers... but all this disc has to offer is a pair of trailers.

In a word: SKIPPABLE.",1447027200,,744,5.235294117647059

8715490,2,B00X99RNH2,"Following on the heels of their bluray double feature of the Italian horror films Ghosthouse & Witchery, Scream Factory unleashes another Italian double feature of ""Metamorphosis"" & ""Beyond Darkness"". While the Ghosthouse & Witchery combo was highly entertaining in a so bad they're great sort of way, ""Metamorphosis"" is just plain bad and ""Beyond Darkness"" doesn't have much going for it other than being directed by the guy who did Troll 2 and also starring Troll 2's Michael Paul Stephenson. (Fans of Italian horror should also take note that Beyond Darkness was filmed in the same house that Lucio Fulci filmed his classic The Beyond in as well).
The biggest issue with each film is just how slow and dull they are in terms of pacing. Metamorphosis has some nasty violence and body horror but in between features awful acting and dialogue which dares you to watch it. Beyond Darkness lacks Troll 2's relentless craziness and hilariously offbeat tone. However fans of Italian horror from the late 80's and early 90's will probably find something to like here.
Picture quality is decent with Metamorphosis looking the worst of the two. I'm sure Scream Factory had to work with what Italian masters they were given as they weren't going to do a full blown restoration for two films that hardly anyone has ever heard of. Sometimes they look like DVD upscales but every now and then do resemble a hi-def presentation. I'm sure this is probably the best they have ever looked and each film is pillar boxed in its original 1.66:1 aspect ratio. Sound is presented in lossless 2 channel stereo with dialogue being plagued by a hiss here and there. The only extras are trailers for each and there are English subtitles.
I would say skip this particular release unless you're an Italian horror junkie.",1441670400,8,1794,4.866013071895424
8715491,3,B00X99RNH2,"Metamorphosis has its momemnts.  The plot involves your average playing with science with bad results.  Features the dumbest looking monster at the end.  Did they shave a bird?  Kept my attention.  I'll give it that.  3/5

Beyond Darkness was a waste of time.  Has the kid from Troll 2.  Some awkward moments make it funny sometimes, but as far as horror, gory goods, or b-movie fun goes, it seriously lacks. Pointless.  2/5

I enjoyed the Ghost House/Witchery combo pack way better.  Give it a shot if you can't get enough.  Just know these aren't b-movie prize winners.  Although Metamorphosis was okay.",1440633600,3,605,4.861386138613861
