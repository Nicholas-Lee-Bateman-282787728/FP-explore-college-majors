8123415,2,B000FII2YI,"Yes, I suppose I'm somewhat spoiled.  After all, this is a DVD complete with three very beautiful young women, occasionally nude together, playing a game that's a cross between strip-poker and truth-or-dare.

But it's boring.

Basically, they're all supposed to have lesbian inclinations, but they're not sure.  It opens with Courtney and two of her female friends fondling eachother in front of a male bartender who just looks foolish gawking in the background.

Then it's time for Courtney's ""game,"" where the girls take turns rolling a die and then picking a card with questions like: ""what would you do alone in a sauna?"" or ""what would you do with a fireplace and wine?"" and then describing it.  In one instance a girl then gyrates nude for the camera, while in others they halfheartedly engage in very bland girl/girl sex.

The writing is incredibly weak throughout, as most of the activity appears to be made up on the spot.  And, of course, eventually they just have to include the male bartender in the action.  I hate being critical of a video with pretty young women removing their clothing and then playing with eachother, but this one was just lame.  Next time maybe they should consider hiring a director and/or a writer with some talent or erotic imagination?",1246320000,3,1274,4.856481481481482
