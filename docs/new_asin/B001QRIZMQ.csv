8557761,2,B001QRIZMQ,Not what I expected - poor quality and more of a tourism promotion than reality.  I expected more from this product.,1360713600,,116,4.523809523809524
8557762,1,B001QRIZMQ,"This film is an almost exact duplicate of Rick Ray's famous ""The Soul Of India"" DVD which I purchased a few years ago!

It looks like they removed Ray's narration (adding a pretentious sounding British narrator saying Ray's exact words), cut out any sections where Ray appears and threw it all onto a cheap DVD for resale.

I wonder if Amazon (or Rick Ray!) is aware of this cheap ripoff of his work. It looks like it comes from some duplicating factory in India, so probably they are stealing works from the West and re-issuing them as cheap knockoffs.

Since the original film featuring Rick is charming and wonderful, why settle for this crummy, patched together, and obviously stolen work?",1347753600,,693,4.758333333333334
8557763,4,B001QRIZMQ,"I really enjoy watching and sharing this well organized Dvd. The visuals are beautiful but often go by very fast. It is a nice trip through some of the more touristy aspects of India, superficial but worthwhile, especially for the price.",1305331200,,237,4.804878048780488
