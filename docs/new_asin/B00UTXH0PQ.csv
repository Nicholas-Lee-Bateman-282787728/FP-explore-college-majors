8708278,5,B00UTXH0PQ,"The Worricker Trilogy is a superb 2014 espionage thriller and political drama from the BBC, which was written and directed by the British playwright and screenwriter Sir David Hare. It is comprised of three exciting ninety-minute episodes, which completely captivate the viewer. Its story line centers around the exploits of a veteran British Secret Service analyst and agent, who must cautiously navigate the complex and treacherous transition from fighting the Cold War for decades, to fighting the present-day war against terrorism. As always, the performance of the lead actor, Bill Nighy, is outstanding, as are the performances of the talented members of the supporting cast. This stellar supporting cast includes such luminaries as Ralph Fiennes, Judy Davis, Tom Hughes, Rachel Weisz, Michael Gambon, Saskia Reeves, Felicity Jones, Marthe Keller, Ewen Bremner, Christopher Walken, Dylan Baker, Zach Grenier, James Naughton, Rupert Graves, Helena Bonham Carter, Winona Ryder, and Olivia Williams, to name a few. The Worricker Trilogy is a decidedly intelligent, suspenseful, and gripping espionage thriller and political drama, and I found it to be extremely engaging and entertaining. The Worricker Trilogy features superb plot and character development, as well as great acting performances, and it definitely merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1507680000,,1387,5.770731707317073
