8418115,5,B0047H7Q3G,This DVD provides very important and thought provoking information about end of life decisions. I watched it and can't stop thinking about it. Recommended for anyone with a very ill family member.,1398816000,,196,5.15625

8418117,4,B0047H7Q3G,"I watched this with a small group of friends.  It's probably not a good idea to watch it alone as it addresses the very difficult questions that families face when a loved one is dying.  The multiple families featured gave a rounded look at the conflicts, confusion, and misunderstandings that can arise at a very difficult time.  People in our group were groaning over some of the decisions made by relatives.  We had a great discussion afterward.  I highly recommend this film for a discussion group.",1384905600,,502,4.790697674418604

8418119,5,B0047H7Q3G,"This is a troubling video.  However, everyone should view it BEFORE they are faced with end-of-life decisions for themselves or loved ones.  The documentary confronts us with issues surrounding the extraordinary means which modern medicine can and frequently does use to extend lives of terminally ill, dying patients.  These issues would ideally be discussed with loved ones and our personal desires related to them so that our dying wishes may be respected.  (See conversationproject.org for info.) Moral, ethical, spiritual and economic, as well as medical questions may be elicited by viewing this video.  I know that it is preferable to view this documentary than to have one's first encounter with end-of-life issues in real life.  It is my personal opinion that spending the end days of one's life in a hospital hooked up to any number of devices is undignified, uncomfortable and undesirable.  I hope that our nation, the medical profession in particular, begins to understand, accept and teach us all that death is a part of life.",1353110400,7,1039,5.148809523809524
8418120,5,B0047H7Q3G,"The End-of-Life/ICU doctors Frontline followed and interviewed in this piece are amazing. Not only are they caring and compassionate, they manage to interview on camera about gut-wrenching decisions that are needing to be made, while still having concern in their voice and not turn into a robot that's not trying to show emotion. I only hope I get doctors like them when I'm in this position.

This show brings up the choices people are faced with when treatment to heal someone is no longer working. They are at the point where they will never get better, and will eventually die. They describe how with our current technology, we can pretty much keep every part of a dying person alive with machines, for years. But then it questions if this is the right thing to do.

The stories are all real lives of people who are dying, and the slower pace of this show works well for it. This gives you time to learn about these individuals, meet their families, understand their pain and watch them as they cling to every last hope for life. No ones story of death should be rushed. These are stories that we will ALL some day find ourselves in. We will either be the one dying, or the family member at the end of the bed.

Stories of grandmothers, fathers, brothers, mothers and husbands are all filmed. You feel as though you're right there in the room with the families, clinging to hope that this one last effort will work. You're heartbroken and crushed with tears in your eyes when you see the results of all their fighting.

They show how there are some treatments that actually kill 30% of all the patients. It asks whether living a year in horrible pain and in constant treatment is better than 4 months of good health, painless life and dying sooner. It shows how in the end, the results are all the same...that no one wants to die.",1310342400,10,1835,4.5347432024169185
8418121,2,B0047H7Q3G,"We now have machines that can keep individuals technically alive after their brains die or lungs stop working.  The big question now is when to abandon efforts.

It would be one thing if this were just senior citizens of advanced age.  I presumed that the show would cover those who already lived a long time.  However, this show had many examples of people younger than 55 whose families have to answer a painful question.

I appreciate that this work covered the gray areas.  A family wasn't sure if they should put their mother on a trach (sp?) device.  The pulled some cable and she actually started breathing.  However, later in the show they reveal that she would require the trach a day later.  A middle-aged man already had two transplants, but they did not cure his problem.  He had children below 21 and his fight to live seemed plausible.

The work does say twice that these efforts are vastly expensive, but I think they could have emphasized it more.  The families in crisis were a diverse group, much more so than the interviewed experts.

The thing is: this work was REALLY slow.  Perhaps since it relates to death, it was purposefully quiet and not eye-catching.  Still, I thought they could summarize things much more quickly than they did.  In fairness, this was not made by Michael Moore.  This was just an installment on PBS that even the makers must assume folk will just watch one night and move on.  They showed real-life examples of this Catch-22 and real life is often slow and kinda dull.

Don't get me wrong: this DVD will be useful to many.  But know in advance you must have patience for its plodding, turtle-like pace.",1296172800,5,1648,4.6366782006920415
