3881595,1,B0029WLJHK,"How many restaurants could thrive by selling leftovers? Well, this is what we're being served with this re-issue. Children of the Gods wasn't one of my favorite episodes, anyway; now we're being served leftovers with a few french fries and a Coke.

After the series ended, the producers figured they could make individual episodes and sell them as independent productions. They got off to a shaky start with ""Ark of Truth,"" and then hit gold with ""Continuum."" Now we're getting leftovers.

I doubt we can expect much more except the trash marketed as ""Stargate Universe,"" which is one of the most awful concoctions imaginable. Even leftovers would be preferable.

As for the production itself, ""Children of the Gods"" is probably worth buying, though I wish they had continued the story on through Kawalski's demise. (I always thought killing him off was a mistake, as he could have easily been a spin-off for another show.) Overall, though, the only disappointment was the Abydos graphic that looked cheesy and unfamiliar. Brad Wright should have made it look more realistic and reminiscent of the movie. In short, they should have used a real desert and dropped in a pyramid.

It also was a great (missed) opportunity to explain why people on the other side of these gates could communicate without knowing English. Wright could have written in a segment explaining this, but instead the entire series erred in never addressing it. Some cultures SG-1 gated to had suits with collars and other clothing that looked like it could have been bought at Macy's.

I approved of them removing the Macgyver line because it was later used by Sam when she and O'Neill were trapped in the North Pole and also in STARGATE ATLANTIS. In other words, it's been done too many times.",1246406400,15,1766,4.892976588628763
3881596,4,B0029WLJHK,"The nudity in the original release was brief and not needed.  Just a woman standing there and being laid down on the table.  How can that be considered pornography.  It was just not needed at all, especially for something that was going to be a television series.  For those calling it pornography, you are not at all upset by the general violence of the series?  I am not, I am just puzzled at the hypocrisy of some people.  Stargate is an excellent series.",1245974400,8,458,4.457831325301205
3881597,5,B0029WLJHK,I didn't know this was available....and I'm very excited. I will be buying it immediately. I do not allow pornography in my home and was aghast when I saw Chidren of the God's. We had already seen and purchased series #2....and were hooked....before we saw this episode. It's been banned from viewing without skipping through it. It will be so pleasant to be able to sit down with the family and view this episode without skipping through pornography.,1245888000,4,451,4.794871794871795
3881598,1,B0029WLJHK,"I have to agree IN FULL with Russel's review so to repeating makes no sense at all.

A thousand if's could come into play here. I do own the 10 years & the quality of the first few, it's true was not great. I wouldn't be surprised if they chose to remaster the first 6 years. You can tell when the technology changed.

If that comes to pass I would hope all the true fans that kept them alive would get some type discount with proof of ownership. Or did that type thinking go out with film?

I'd go on but it makes little sense, if your reading this your certainly not ignorant or foolish.

3881599,1,B0029WLJHK,"What the hell is going on here, I have this episode already and it's OK not the best Stargate episode ever so why after over 10 years come back to this one.  There is talk that the director was concerned about the nudity, but let's get real that lasted about 30 seconds in a 2 hour show so what is the big deal, in addition it was actually realistic as I do not think the Go'uld cared about thier slaves clothes. What I don't want is a sanitised version for the young people that they now want to attract for Stargate Universe or should I say Teenagers in space, which I am sure that thie is the real reason for the re-release. rubbish get season 1 on DVD and enjoy about 20 episodes for a few dollars more not this cash in rubbish.  If they were really so concerned they would give this version away for free, but no it's all about the money",1244937600,26,842,4.128048780487805
3881600,5,B0029WLJHK,"The reason this is being rereleased is because some of you might recall the nudity in the original first epi. The creator did NOT want to do the episode that way. The station or whoever had bought it insisted that he do it their way.

Now that all of Stargate is out however, he can redo the episode as it was origianlly intended to be viewed (and they can't say anything about it!).

I for one am curious about what will be different.

Hope this helps. :)",1244592000,23,456,4.218390804597701
3881601,5,B0029WLJHK,"It seems kind weird that the studio would re-release this episode. However, there is a good reason for it. I'm a big fan of Stargate SG-1, so I will be getting this eventually, even though I have all 10 seasons of the show and the 2 TV movies.

The studio's write-up of this 90-minute release describes it as ""Re-mastered. Re-cut. Re-imagined. Remarkable! The thrilling pilot episode with exclusive special features and masterful fine-tuning from series Co-Creator Brad Wright is the ultimate realization of the series' iconic launch.""

3881612,1,B0029WLJHK,"When Babylon 5's creator redid its opening movie (The Gathering) is was a HUGE improvement over the first version.

Sadly that's not the case with Stargate's redoing of its pilot movie.  They dropped scenes that should have stayed, because they are referenced later in the series.  Plus they added scenes that don't contribute anything new to the story.  There's also some blatant inconsistency with the existing story canon (which did not exist in the original version).

I saw don't waste your money, and just watch the Children of the Gods version included on Season 1 (the original).",1494806400,2,587,5.010309278350515

We really liked the Stargate SG1 show, and it had been years since we watched this (it's the pilot episode for the show, presented as a TV movie). It ages really well! The effects are great, the acting is top, the writing is very strong.

If you haven't seen the Stargate SG1 show, 'Children of the Gods' picks up after the 1994 'Stargate' movie. The same race as Ra from the movie (called Goa'uld) activate the Stargate and capture a female airman. Turns out, the Goa'uld are doing the same on other planets. The USAF re-activates Col. Jack O'Neill and his team to go back through the Stargate and figure out what's going on. There's a lot of action, and the story ties in well to the 1994 movie while setting up a slightly different premise that they used for the TV series.

Worse than that is you come across a sitcom  which is free. You watch few seasons and when you reach the last season you have to pay around $30.00 to watch the last season.

However, if you are looking for something to work as an introduction to the television series, then I would say you should avoid this and just stick with the original version (which would be available as part of the season one DVD set or with the complete series collection).

Yes, this version does have some improvements. Some of the effects are better. Even though it has its detractors, I think that the redubbing of Teal'c's dialogue works well. Some of the added bits of scenes are nice. And (while I'm not one to object to it) the nudity in the pilot did seem out of place and would also make the show difficult to introduce to children, so the removal of it is not a loss.

However, some of the other things that were cut are moments that, as a fan of the show, were memorable and now are very noticable in their absence. The extra banter between O'Niell and Hammond before getting right down to business may have slowed down the pacing a bit, but showed a hint of the relationship those two characters would build as the show progressed. Sam's ""reproductive organs"" line was indeed cringe worthy, but the fact that much later in the series it is jokingly referenced at least twice leaves those later references as orphaned punchlines with no set up. I hated the removal of Sam's usage of ""McGivering"" the Starrage, a nice little in-joke that didn't stick out like a sore thumb if you didn't get the joke but would put a brief smile on your face if you did.

And worst of all, I think, is removing the elements that led to the episode ending on a cliffhanger that would be picked up on the following episode. That is why I said that this version works well as a stand alone feature, and it is clearly how the powers behind the scenes treated it when they prepared it. But, let us face it, this is NOT a stand alone feature. It is the first episode of a series, and the next episode -- while it still works -- is a lot more confusing and doesn't play as smoothly with the set-up for it cut from this episode.

If you have no intention of continuing past this episode, if the small bit of nudity present in the original version would overly bother you, or if you are a Stargate SG-1 completionist, then this release may be for you. Otherwise, you may as well stick with the original version.",1357430400,2,2629,4.696312364425163

3881750,1,B0029WLJHK,"Children of the Gods is the movie-length pilot of Stargate SG-1. It is said that there were creative differences between the producers and the networked ""Showtime"" chipped in, too. Additionally due to the story-telling of the series some aspects don't make sense anymore.

Thus someone decided to create a ""Final Cut"" version of the pilot where scenes are reordered, shortened and the FX were enhanced.

Changes that were made (in loose order):

The (in)famous full frontal nudity scene of Sha're was re-cut. She's still naked but one does not see it anymore. Back then Showtime insisted on the scene to push the MPAA rating up. But since SG-1 is supposedly a ""family show"" this was deemed inappropriate. This is one change I don't mind. The scene never bothered me (why should it?) but it's no loss either. But from where I am standing, I could start an argument on why a show where most people carry weapons of some form and were people get killed on a weekly basis (and we're talking big bloody staff weapon wounds) somehow becomes ""family friendly"" just because they cut out the 20 seconds nudity scene.

In the original version, Apophis captured that female Air Force officer, brought her into his harem, then also captured Sha're. Then he tested said officer, deemed her unworthy, killed her, tested Sha're and implanted the Goa'uld. Now he captures the officer, kills her, captures Sha're and implants the larva. No harem. In combination with the above nudity scene the pilot showed how Humans are merely ""walking meat"" in the eyes of the Goa'uld. They have no regard for the value of human lives. They are just slaves for them to command.
This ruthlessness gets lost in the new version. Here Apophis takes only what he deems necessary as if he would actually care. Don't know why they did it but I don't like it.

Earth has no DHD (keyboard to open the gate), they built a computer to do the work. But in the original version Apophis magically opened the gate without using the computer. Now one hears him shout a command and it sounds as if his Jaffa are dialling out manually. That's OK.
Another FX change is in regard to the Death Glider. The pilot had a never seen again version of the Death Glider that has a ring transporter system. They added an additional Tel'tak (a transport vessel later introduced in the series) and made it look like as if the Tel'tak activated the ring transport. That's OK, too.

They also removed the scene where Kawalsky is taken over by a Goa'uld (which is addressed in the episode after the pilot). That makes somewhat sense for a stand-alone movie but even then they could have let it in.
They also removed the scene where Kawalsky doesn't know that O'Neill had a son. That makes sense, because it's later established that they've known each other for many years.

But what I really didn't like were some changes in the pacing and in Sam's introduction. In the original version there's some bantering between the old gang and Sam when General Hammond introduces her (topics: She's a woman and a scientist). That and when it comes up again when they meet Daniel was all cut out. But instead they used alternate cuts of the scenes or simply cut it out. Now the flow is gone. Some of the scenes end with a long pause before the next camera angle. It's like the actors are waiting for the director to shout ""cut"". It happens all the time, especially in the beginning. There's no natural flow anymore.
I always liked the joke about the location of Carter's reproduction organs, especially because they make fun about it later in the series.

And they removed the MacGyver joke!  *foul play*

So my final judgement is that I can't think of anyone who actually needs this ""Final Cut"". *Thumbs down*",1341619200,11,3735,4.679878048780488

3881754,5,B0029WLJHK,"Another Stargate Movie?  A remake of ""Stargate"" The Movie?

NOPE, NEITHER.  But it does sound familiar, doesn't it?  This is the first episode of SG-1, also known as the ""pilot"" (I thought ""Stargate The Movie"" was the pilot).  If you've got SG-1 Season 1 or the entire series (and who doesn't?), then you've already got the original version of ""Children of the Gods"".  It has been remastered, and tinkered with, but it is still low-definition DVD, not High-Def Blu-ray.  In my opinion the ""tinkering"" promises more than it delivers (i.e., the improvement isn't that obvious, because the story defines the movie), and I object to anything being deleted from the original, particularly for the sake of polical correctness.  I'll wait for the Blu-ray, hopefully with the cut scenes restored---maybe they can call it the ""Re-Extended Edition"", or ""Final Re-Edit""

By the way ""The Movie"" although long available on Blu-ray, has been re-mastered yet again as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-15th-Anniversary-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B002KPINY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate (15th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray</a>] ---so the old Blu-ray extended cut is selling for a buck or two&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-Extended-Cut-Blu-ray/dp/B000HIVOI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate (Extended Cut) [Blu-ray</a>].  True, the original Blu-ray sufferes from some minor defects if you look hard on a big screen, but again it is the story which defines the movie.  The most eggredious ""defect"" of the movie (preserved in the original blue-ray) was crappy camera techinique--lotsa lens flair which washes out many scenes---which no ""remastering"" can recover.  So I don't plan on buying the 15th Anniversery edition.  If you still haven't yet upgraded from a ""full screen"" DVD original cut, the original blu-ray extended cut that people are virtually giving away is a good opportunity.

On the otherhand, every dollar which is spent purchasing re-releases of re-releases of Stargate anything probably matters to an accountant somewhere who is considering the profitablility of bringing back SGU---so, by all means, buy every new Stargate anything anybody offers for sale.  Buy two or three of each.

3881755,2,B0029WLJHK,"I am a HUGE Stargate fan. I saw the movie in the theater several times, enjoyed the series when it was on Showtime, and I have all of the DVDs.  I must say that Children of the Gods is one of my favorites of all the SG-1 series.  So, when I saw this one, I thought I must get it.  I watched the clip on Amazon stating that some things were taken out and other stuff was put in.  Things were fixed and the show was supposed to be all around better.  Unfortunately, I must disagree with that statement.

Yes, there are things that are better.  Christopher Judge's voice IS better.  This was a nice change... although I don't know that I noticed it needed it until it was done.  However there are many things they have cut out that I really enjoyed.  For example, ""... just because my reproductive organs are on the inside instead of the outside, doesn't mean I can't handle whatever you can handle."" was removed!  And, although they kept the part where they said, ""This is what was missing from the dig at Giza. This is how they controlled it. It took us 15 years and 3 supercomputers to MacGyver a system for the gate on Earth.""  They replaced MacGyver with jury-rigged.  I was SHOCKED!  As a fan of Stargate and of course MacGyver, I couldn't understand why they would get rid of this great quote.

The behind-the-scenes on the Final Cut version talks about changes made to the gate itself, but in all honest, I never noticed it.  I even pulled up the original one on my computer and watched sections of it as I watched the new one on my blu ray.  I didn't see much of a change... and many of my friends would consider me anal.  LOL

Another scene that was missing was the nudity in the beginning when they are trying to find a mate for Apophis. Although I like the other version better, I could do with or without the nudity.

Will I keep this version? Sure!  It can come in handy when I need to show it with children around since the nudity is gone, but I think I would have rather some of the classic stuff in there.

My two cents.

3881756,4,B0029WLJHK,"Most TV shows spun off from movies are uninvolving and uninteresting (""Blade,"" anyone?), and hopefully die and are forgotten.

That wasn't the case with the spinoff of the 1995 movie ""Stargate,"" an okay science fiction movie that spawned an excellent television series. And ""Stargate SG-1: Children of the Gods -- a recut and polished-up version of the original pilot movie -- is actually far better than it sounds, with a tightened narrative, souped-up special effects (more modern puddles), and a more dramatic soundtrack.

The Stargate has been inactive for a year -- until it is activated, and a bunch of Egyptian-styled warriors come through and kidnap a young officer. General Hammond (Don S. Davis) pulls Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) out of retirement to learn what really happened on the planet of Abydos, and where these mysterious aliens have come from.

O'Neill and a small team go to Abydos and encounter Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) who has been learning about a vast network of Stargates over the past year. But when Daniel's wife Sha're and brother-in-law Skaara are abducted by the same warriors, O'Neill, Jackson and Air Force scientist Sam Carter (Amanda Tapping) use the Stargate to venture to where they're being kept.

What they find is an alien race who inhabits human hosts, the Goa'uld, and their ruthless slave warriors, the Jaffa. Carter, O'Neill and Jackson are captured by the powerful Apophis -- but to escape, they must have the help of an unlikely ally: Teal'c (Christopher Judge), one of the Jaffa.

""Stargate SG-1: Children of the Gods had some beginning-of-series awkwardness, and even the recut scenes don't quite cover this (Teal'c is still an enigma, and the team hasn't quite gelled into the trusting, close-as-family unit). But it shows the seeds of what would become an excellent TV series, both in the overall arc storyline and the standalone episodes.

It also has some wonderfully snappy, tart dialogue, mostly provided by the brilliant O'Neill. The Egyptian-styled sets and effects have a slightly low-budget style, but the script adds some brilliant twists to the original idea, such as hundreds of Stargates scattered through the cosmos. And the makers add some warm scenes, such as the eager Abydonian teenagers celebrating with O'Neill and his pals, which really makes the characters seem human.

As for the recut edition, it's actually not as bad as it sounds; there aren't any George Lucas-style mega changes just for the heck of it (the Abydonians aren't suddenly replaced by screeching dancing CGI bands). It's mostly about tightening up the original episode. The soundtrack is made more dramatically orchestral, and apparently the actors did a bit of rerecorded vocals (honestly, I didn't notice, but I wasn't listening carefully). It also some has some nice behind-the-scenes information about the recut movie and going back to the series' start, and a fun little commentary with Richard Dean Anderson and Brad Wright.

Additionally, dialogue is trimmed off (Sam's silly ""reproductive organs"" spiel) or added back in (""Anyone can send a NOTE!""), the special effects are tweaked (the event horizon has been turned a more luminous blue, and the pyramid matte painting has been replaced), and some alternate takes have been inserted (Sam's audible yelp when Jack shoves her through the Stargate). The most controversial aspect of it is that Share's full frontal nude scene has been removed, which is bad or good depending on your attitude -- apparently the creators never wanted it, but they were forced to.

The cast is also quite good -- Michael Shanks and Richard Dean Anderson have excellent chemistry as the cynical military man and the enthusiastic nerd, both of whom are still struggling with their own personal tragedies. Tapping is also quite good as a capable scientist/soldier, but Judge sadly doesn't get to show much of his formidable range as Teal'c (although you can see little flickers here and there of his awesomeness).

""Stargate SG-1: Children of the Gods"" was a good start to the classic, epic sci-fi series, and despite a few controversial twiddles the ""Final Cut"" is a solid polish-up of the original TV movie. It's not essential, but it's a good complement.",1320278400,6,4243,5.127351664254704

3881763,5,B0029WLJHK,"I rewatched the pilot for the first time in years, because I was introducing my friend to the show, and it was actually kind of hard for me to get through. I was embarrassed for Stargate and kept having to explain that the show really did get better, honest!

Sure it had the lackluster effects that were available to them in 1997, but the problem wasn't just that it was dated. There were also those infamously cheesy lines. And perhaps more importantly, the pacing bothered me and the score seemed to be lathered on without discretion.

The story holds better with this new, tighter editing. A lot of needless exposition was taken out (along with a completely gratuitous nude scene) to make way for improved special effects and added shots that fit with the tone and storyline of the rest of the show. It just makes it a better movie. Period.

I kind of miss the MacGyver reference, but that's a small price to pay for the overall improvement. Daniel's referring to Samantha Carter as ""Captain-Doctor"" was a fun moment in the original, but to keep that line in they would also have to keep the jabs Carter and O'Neill kept making to each other about whether she was military enough to go on the mission. Carter's edited introduction is much more in character for both Carter and O'Neill. It makes them more playful towards each other rather than having the completely forced tension of, ""Uh-oh, there's a woman on the team now! Will they stand for it? But look, she's sassy! You go, girl!"" The new version raises that issue and deals with it in a matter of seconds, rather than dragging it out with a lot of cringe-worthy dialogue.

Bottom line: the next time I introduce someone to Stargate, I'm having them watch this version instead of the original pilot. But I will still tell them about the ridiculous ""Just because my reproductive organs are on the inside instead of the outside..."" line so they can laugh along with me when the show parodies it later on.",1288569600,2,1963,4.616045845272207

Good for you for standing up to nudity in public (films are public) I have had to throw loads of films in the garbage because of the nudity contained in them.

I think that nudity is not meant to be displayed to others (except one's spouse, & even then, it should be done in modesty)

I commend the people who made the decision to remove the nudity. I have purchased this & also the full series. Needless to say I will not be watching that scene in the original pilot & that disk will be getting the heave-ho.

Great entertainment and really thought provoking.,1280361600,,327,4.377049180327869
3881768,4,B0029WLJHK,"I just watched this last night. So you know where I'm coming from as a reviewer, I watched Stargate off and on (didn't have Showtime) until it went to Sci-Fi and my cable company decided to add it. I had seen the movie and, while I thought it was just okay at the time (appreciate it more now), I was ecstatic over the scene where Daniel discovers how the local language works -- the first time I've ever seen honest-to-goodness linguistics work done onscreen. Once I had the chance to watch regularly I did, every week. When the DVDs came out I bought Season 4, was very happy with it, loved the special features on it (commentaries on every single episode, most of them quite good), eventually went back and purchased every season. I've watched through the whole thing more than once, I confess.

OK, onto the reworked Children of the Gods. There are two reasons I can think of to purchase this DVD. (1) You are a big enough Stargate fan that you know much of the dialogue by heart and will recognize when little bits of dialogue and/or scene are taken out or added, or perhaps even when a different take from the original dailies is used (okay, I didn't notice any of the latter until it was pointed out in the commentary). (2) You'd like to be able to watch the whole Stargate series with your kids...except for the, ahem, fully exposed Share in Children of the Gods.

So, yes, dialogue and scenes have been tweaked. Carter's lines about playing with GI Joe dolls and the location of her reproductive organs, so universally hated by all including actress Amanda Tapping (all except the guy who had the biggest vote apparently) -- they are gone. It's true that Jack's line about not caring that she's a woman seems out of the blue now...oh how I wish they could just reshoot that scene entirely somehow! Jack's lines telling his ""best friend"" about how his son died are wisely cut (they were included at the time because it was a pilot and new viewers might not know that background from the movie); nothing feels missing and the scene plays wonderfully. A couple of little bits here and there have been added; I would wrinkle my brow thinking, ""I don't remember that,"" and sure enough in the commentary I would find out it was added. These are not newly filmed scenes (it was like 13 years ago!) but bits pulled from cut scenes. In several places different takes were used, which is pretty amazing -- an example is when Jack picks up the returned empty kleenex box. If you are a true hardcore fan you'll want to have two TVs set up side by side and watch for the differences (and then tell me about it)!. I only knew about this from listening to the commentary.

At least three actors looped some of their lines; Amanda Tapping and Michael Shanks in at least one scene (when Daniel shows them the room with all the gate addresses), though I couldn't tell what had changed, other than the added bit with Amanda and a kind of crane shot over the wall. According to the commentary Chris Judge looped every single one of his lines. Wow! That's pretty cool. Pilots are often pretty painful to go back and watch; since the characters are still being figured out by both writers and actors, great to have Chris go in and bring his developed interpretation of Teal'c to the pilot.

Some of the visual effects were updated; frankly I didn't care about that. I didn't watch SG-1 for the special effects (though they were mostly pretty good). I actually kind of didn't like the replacement of the wormhole with the one used on Atlantis, it felt out of place to me, alien, if you'll pardon the pun.

I admit to being a Carter fan, so maybe I'm biased, but I always felt Carter was the most underserved character in the pilot (and early episodes in general), with Teal'c in a close second. This reworked version actually adds just a touch to her character, mostly with just a few added looks and glances that let us see a little bit more of her personality (and a little bit less instruction on the location of her various organs).

As for Reason Two, Share's modesty has thankfully been restored to her. That scene as shot never belonged on Stargate, and everyone involved knew it -- apparently they were under pressure from Showtime...surprise surprise.

OK, I just thought of a third reason you might want to get this: (3) You're at least vaguely interested in the process of filmmaking and find it a rather fascinating concept to go back to something done over a decade ago and tweak it in light of the next decade of filmmaking that followed it.

I liked it for all three reasons.

Why 4 stars and not 5? (1) No special features other than the commentary. (2) The commentary is mostly very fun and instructional (from the perspective of Reason Three above) and funny -- is that Richard Dean Anderson or Jack O'Neill on the commentary??? However, there's a bit of PG-13 language in it, language not found in the episode/movie itself. I'm always a bit annoyed when the commentary rating should be higher than the work they're commenting on. (3) It's a tweaked version of something you already own (probably), it's not like it's really *new*, you know?",1276473600,4,5145,4.559523809523809
3881769,2,B0029WLJHK,"One of the things that made the original pilot good was the feeling that it is a spin-off of the feature film. It had many good character moments in it, it had a stock footage shot from the film on Abydos of the pyramid, and music from the film too. But this version seem to want to get as far away from the film as possible even though it's suppose to follow on from it. Many of the charater moments are removed, the stock shot from the film is replaced by crapy-looking CGI effects, and much of the music is totally different.

This version also seems rushed. They cut out many good scenes as well as some of the action itself. They even sped up many of the scenes themselves, and now instead of excellent performaces we have our charaters saying lines really fast as if the actors are just trying to get the scene out of the way so they can go home as soon as they can. I know that's not what they did, but with the editing the way it is, it seems that way when watching it. And there's not much time to get to know our charaters either.

They also cut out the nudity scene. What's up with that! I liked that scene. Not only because it had a beautiful naked woman in it, but the scene was also saying how ruthless the Goa'uld are. Without that scene it makes them seem less ruthless. I thought the point was to make them very ruthless? That was the point of the show. The Goa'uld are the bad guys and bad guys are suppose to be ruthless. The ruthless the better. It's also a lot scarier when you actually see the nudity too. It hurt the pilot greatly when they cut that scene out. Now this new version may be the better version to show the kids. But this show is more for adults anyway so I don't see what the big problem is with having a little nudity in it.

They also cut out the cliffhanger ending. Which, I suppose, is better if you don't want the whole series. But if you do, then the original cliffhanger ending is better.

In all, I wasn't too impressed with this version. I much prefer the original.

Not recommended!",1273708800,9,2029,4.1923076923076925
3881770,5,B0029WLJHK,"I have no problem with the nudity in the original pilot, but the soundtrack in the old pilot was an embarrassingly lame dub of the motion picture soundtrack onto the pilot footage. Ra's theme would play over scenes where there were no Goa'uld or Jaffa. It was random and annoying.

Just as Goldsmith's musical arrangements of David Arnold's original motion picture soundtrack have become character entities in and of themselves over the course of 10 seasons plus 2 movies (not to mention 2 spin-off series), the music Goldsmith composed for ""Children of the Gods"" makes this Final Cut make more sense narratively. The gorgeous musical themes match the action and character motivations, and do justice to the emotional arcs set forth by the original movie.

Chris Judge brought his A-game to the ADR work for this cut, so he no longer sounds like Yul Brenner in the ""King & I"" (a joke made in the commentary). His brand new vocal work as Teal'c is outstanding here and honors the character's development over 10 years on Stargate SG-1.

There are some remarkable nuances in this cut for some iconic scenes, and they breathe fresh air into character arcs. O'Neill & Carter exchange a look of challenge at the end of the briefing room scene where they meet, and it's a revelation of subtle rivalry between the characters that should've been allowed to inform their relationship dynamics early in the series.

The scenes where Sha're appears before she's abducted are different, too; some wise people kept all the dailies footage and Brad Wright chose some fresher camera angles from them.

Brad Wright & Richard Dean Anderson's commentaries are funny and informative; they're not just babbling to fill time.

If you adore Joel Goldsmith's spectacular music, then the Director's Cut is well worth having in your collection, if not for all the other additions. I have the original pilot on DVD for when I just gotta ogle the harem scenes that were deleted. Uh... for the costumes, of course... yeah...",1270857600,,1996,4.908011869436201
3881771,5,B0029WLJHK,"Brad Wright does say that some fans will hate him for what he did with this pilot.  Well I don't!  A masterful job and I've been a fan since the Kurt Russell movie!

Brad Wright went back to his original 1994 pilot and cleaned it up; he changed several scenes, added CGI in a few places that  needed it (without the invasive stuff that plagued Star Wars: A New Hope when Lucas tried the same thing), got rid of the scratches and marks, and even had Christopher Judge redo a few scenes to make it come across better.

I do miss the nude scene with Ms. Bandera, sigh.  But I digress.

Watching this reawakened my love for this series and why it lasted for ten full years of excitement and adventure.  The big, bad Goauld, the betrayal of T'lck, the struggle between military orders and humanity by General Hammond.

I forgot how much tougher the military was in this pilot.  They really, really wanted to set off that nuclear bomb and send it through the gate!  Even Hammond was saying how much he just wanted to bury the damn thing and wish they never unearthed the thing.

And the actors are so young!  The meeting with Captain Carter was cleaned up to where she is not bragging about her reproductive organs being on the inside than the outside...blah blah.  If you have seen the original original, you know this did not work well at all.  Brad Wright cut all that and with some re-editing made it a much more positive meeting.

The development of the plot points and the establishment of Apophus and the loss of Shari and Skara was very intense.

A dedication to the memory of Don S. Davis, the actor who played General Hammond and passed away in 2008, was a touching thought.

The DVD has a making-of, an interview with Wright, and a discussion of the many changes that were done with the pilot.  He even said some of the fans may hate him for making changes, but if they don't like it, let them watch the old one!

3881774,3,B0029WLJHK,"Really overall I think this ""recut"" was completely unnecessary. When I heard it was coming I preordered the DVD thinking it would enhance my collection. OK some stuff was cleaned up and a few things restored but then things were also removed which led to a couple of inconsistencies later on. I guess the idea was to make the ""pilot"" more in line with the rest of the series. Why? It was a pilot in large part based on the first movie, which is just fine. People have said that is was OK to remove the brief ""nude"" scene. Well it wasn't for me. Frankly I liked that bit because lets face it, she had a beautiful body, and the scene fitted into the storyline just fine. Apophis and his mate wanted to admire the body in which she was to exist. Also removed is the Kowalsky storyline which is a problem for later.

Removing Sam's McGuyver reference was another annoyance. Maybe some younger people might not get it but it was a nice little homage to RDA's past. There is more but it has been covered before. While I think that changing the music was OK, it wasn't necessary, and I think the stuff that was removed in this version could have been left in, as well as returning the deleted scenes. Really with a recut version I expect to get more for my money not less. It should be an addition to a series which it isn't.

Casual viewers of the show or newbies may enjoy it but I think most fans of the show will be disappointed. When I rewatch the series I will be watching the oiginal version of the pilot.",1264809600,9,1505,4.277192982456141

The episodes are essentially intact except they took out the nude scene with Daniel Jackson's wife. That makes me wonder what else is missing, however I saw it so many years ago I'm not sure what else they tampered with.

It is a great introduction to the series. Same setting as the original movie, but a different cast of main characters. At first I was wondering if they would ruin the premise of the original classic movie with Kurt Russell and James Spader. However, the new SG-1 took over the torch and performed very honorably to the original intent. For the past decade I've watched every episode and seen the changes as the cast develops. It was refreshing to see how they were originally introduced.

3881778,1,B0029WLJHK,"This project seemed like a waste of money right from its first announcement, and the final product has done nothing to dispel that notion.

Here, we see that the showrunners have jazzed up old effects to be more in line with current ones--which now means that the snazzy new effects look great, but are completely out of context if you're to watch this and then move on to the next episode of the regular series.  Certain scenes have also been hacked to pieces in the interest of ""flow"", but as a result come across choppy (sometimes to the point of near-gibberish).

They've also re-cut certain parts of the feature so that it stands up on its own.  This is especially puzzling.  It doesn't stand on its own; it's not a proper sequel to the original film, it's the pilot episode of a 10-season-long series.  Likewise certain things have been edited so they make more context in the sense of the series, despite the obvious intention of trying to make this standalone.  The result is a puzzling and somewhat frustrating exercise in this being a cut which really doesn't know which side of the fence it's on.

The price for this items is also more than a bit ridiculous, for something that's already available in a slightly less polished form at a FRACTION of the price, as part of the complete first season boxset.

I enjoyed what little updated special effects they put in. but it wasn't the big ""Ooo, aah!"" moment it was hyped to be.

Editing out the nudity ... I can see both sides of the argument.  On the one side, Showtime wanted it, MGM didn't.  On the other, the forced nudity established that humans are nothing more but cattle to the Goa'uld.  Although basically that happens in the re-edit, it's not as shocking as the original.

Re-dubbing Teal'c's voice was a plus.  Taking out Carter's ""reproductive organs"" line was a win.  No one ever liked that line.  The show writers even made fun of it later on in the series.  Taking out the ""Macguyver"" line was a fail.  That line was always hilarious and a nod to Anderson's previous work.

My biggest beef with the re-edit is that they took out the Goa'uld taking over Kawalsky's body.  Which would in turn change the plot of the series.  Without that takeover, they wouldn't have had to Kawalsky in ""The Enemy Within"" and he would, I think, have played a major role in the series as the leader of SG-2.  However, the writers of the show loved writing time travel and alternate realities into episodes, so this could be explained away with one of those theories I guess.

That being said while I am glad they took that out, I was dissappointed in some of the changes that were made. Some of the dialogue was changed, things that took away from the essence of Stargate. To be honest, I would have loved a new edition that just took out the nudity, something I could finally watch with my kids. This is okay. I bought it basically to support the stargate franchise.",1251590400,3,504,4.372340425531915
3881787,5,B0029WLJHK,The final cut is a wonderful cut of the original improving it more ways than an average final cut it is an excellent improvement that brings the excellent quality of the Stargate SG-1 series into the pilot,1251504000,2,205,4.5675675675675675
3881788,3,B0029WLJHK,"I have to admit that I was apprehensive about the content and undecided as to whether or not I would buy this DVD. I read the reviews on Amazon.com, and ultimately decided to buy it, since I was very curious to see it, and wondered what exactly was put in that was different. Brad Wright, in the featurette, admits he took out 7 minutes of the original footage, but enthusiastically says that he ""put in new footage."" I am an ardent Stargate fan, and I was hoping to see some interesting new footage.

First, several of my favorite lines were removed - Carter's ""Just because my reproductive organs are on the inside..."" speech is removed, and frankly I object to that for two reasons - first, people watching Moebius in season 8 will not get the joke as she repeats those lines, and secondly, I think it makes O'Neill's line a bit later ""I don't have a problem with women, I like women..."" seem a bit out of context to me. Also removed - O'Neill's back and forth with Hammond about writing a book after retirement - that was funny, and I miss it!

Changed, just for example, when the team first gets to Abydos, and O'Neill brushes past Daniel to get to Skaara, he actually brushes him in the original, leading to a slightly hurt look from Daniel as he recoils from the brush-by. In this version, that does not occur. It is interesting to me to see the different ways the shoot a scene. The dead Jaffa that is unveiled now also has a friend - female at that, which goes against Canon. The prison scene where Daniel regains consciousness seems to have more dialogue between him and Jack, and he seems to almost pass out a couple more times than I remember from the original. The scene where Daniel and Sam are dialing the gate at the end is shorter. They took out Daniel's ""got it"" and big smile moment - or shortened it, which disappointed me.

Totally new, well, there is now a short briefing room scene right after they return from Abydos where Daniel is still in his robes. Frankly, the end to that scene bothered me a lot - I felt that Hammond was overly rude. I know in the pilot he was not especially friendly or patient, but I thought his comment was very rude. Chris Judge redid his lines for his version, and now sounds too much like season 10 Teal'c.

Overall, I am mostly glad I bought this, but as Brad Wright said in his featurette, ""those that don't care for this version can watch the original"" - count me in that group. I hope this helps people get a better understanding of what is different.",1251158400,204,2509,4.389247311827957
3881789,2,B0029WLJHK,"Don't waste your money.  They took out the Macgyver reference.  They took out the ""reproductive organs"" line. Major Matt Mason.  The nudity, that underscored how demeaning and brutal the G'ould where and countless other dialog.  Some FX are redone and that is cool, but the editing just went to far.

I am a Huge SG-1, Atlantis, Stargate the Movie fan and even tried to watch the animated series.  I do not write these words easily.

The new cut is a tighter, more focused version that doesn't suffer from Showtime's preoccupation with nudity.

3881791,1,B0029WLJHK,"First off, don't get me wrong i LOVE Stargate! i own every DVD of both SG1 and Atlantis, even have a few novles! Shows i watch and watch and love the more i watch! When i first heard last year about this ""re-imagined"" pilot movie i was excited! Becaused it is one of my fave episodes of SG1 (If not my first)
But when i watched this right off the bat i was deeply disappointed! Lines were cut out from the movie that didn't even need to be! making much of the start seem rushed! Sam's intro scene got a big chop, She has a few new lines here and there in the movie as well. Brad Wright said it made her character 'stronger' i didn't see this! Because she seems more wide eyed then in the original! Especially when she meets Dr Jackson for the 1st time!(i did a face palm to that one!)
Teal'c (Christopher Judge) had his ADR re looped making him sound out of Season ten where his voice has become alot deeper with age.  The new CGI isn't anything that made me go 'wow what an improvement!' Yeah the nudity scene was cut, this i didn't mind cause thats not what Sg1 is about, but the few new 'scenes' added in have changed the flow of the movie for me! The new scenes are nothing worth the money of this DVD! They seemed rushed and poorly scripted (and the reason why this dvd was done was cause Wright didn't like most of the early writing?) Most are just different takes of scenes that were in the original, which i guess were not In the original because they weren't as good in performance and scripting!!
The biggest sin of a change was taking out  the ""Macgyver"" referance, which i thought was a nice touch to Richard Dean Anderson who is one of may fav actors! But this next change is what has me stumped the most! Where Major Kawalsky gets a Goa'uld in him is completely removed, why? I have no idea!! Has Wright in his thirst for easy money forgotten about the episode ""The Enemy Within"" ?? Which follows up from the Children of the Gods!!!! As i said, im stumped with that one!
I never thought the day would come where i would be upset with a Stargate dvd for it is my most loved TV show, but sad to say, that day as arrived...
All in all this 'Re-hashed' version might be for one off new comers! Since it has no ties with the next Episode in the 1st season now! I don't know how any true Stargate SG1 fan can find anything in this to make it seem worth it or that is is better! This DVD has gone into my collection (which i guess makes it complete still) and when i next start the SG1 saga again, i will be watching the original polit movie over this!",1251072000,134,2559,4.157258064516129

Sure the original Showtime version was for adults with the nudity, but it was from Showtime.  What do you expect?

The scenes 'added' and 'replaced' do not add anything to the story and in fact detract from it.  In their enthusiasm to change a scene they even clipped Jack O'Neill's line towards end of the movie.  They show Tealc slowly 'shaking his head' in disapproval - that was not in the original. I didn't find the video quality any better.

The new special effects are well done, but the original special effects were just as good. It's interesting to see the extra lines of dialog here and there (none are whole new scenes, just fragments of scenes) but makes little overall difference.

Carter's remark about her reproductive organs was classic in the original and they also took out most of her dialogue that portrayed her as a strong woman!! In this new version she is less than the Carter I remember from the show! Without the reproductive organ remark O'Neill's comment about his dislike for Carter about having nothing to do with her being a woman makes no sense in this new version!! They have made this into a G-rated version of the film because mothers don't like their kids to see the nudity shots or the less than approiate dialogue which I understand completely but the Original version did say the pilot was an R-rated version for a scene of nudity!!! So they did warn the parents! This item is a waste of money!!!!! Hopefully if everyone who hates this version is lucky enough like me to have the original unedited version on DVD!

I think people have their priorities more than a bit screwed up.

Don't misunderstand.

Stargate should concentrate on new movies with fresh content and not try to pedal remakes of TV episodes.  The hoopla over this being something ""very"" special is overrated.

You still see how Apophis looks at Sha're, and how they treated her. What you don't see is her breast and pubic hairs. The most you see is her back (just the back, no butt) and belly, that's it. So for all the people concerned about a pivotal scene missing, it's not. Just the nudity. The movie is also a lot tighter now. It's about 7 minutes shorter than the original, but you don't miss it. They also used different takes in some scenes than what was used in the original. The biggest improvement is Christopher Judge redid his vocal performance. There is only one part where you can tell his voice was dubbed, other that that, flawless! The new special effects are a great improvement also.

The new special effects are quite good especially the battle scene at the end.

Definitely a nice ""alternate"" version to the original. Give it a look at least once so you can decide. The good news is that you have a choice. If you don't like this new version, you can always continue watching the old one.",1248307200,4,606,4.401785714285714
3881810,4,B0029WLJHK,"I'm not sure the remastered and re-edited version of the series' pilot, ""Stargate SG-1: Children of the Gods"", on DVD, will win any new fans to the franchise, but I'm pleased that Brad Wright, the 'guiding light' of the TV series, cared enough to try to improve upon it, after 12 years. His changes are largely cosmetic (looping dialogue...including ALL of Christopher Judge's, cleaning up scratchy scenes, improving mat paintings and FX, and utilizing more of Joel Goldsmith's music), but he did make a few very noticable edits (eliminating seven minutes), that actually do tighten and improve the film.

The most obvious cut is, of course, removing Vaitiare Bandera's full-frontal nudity, in the scene when she is possessed by the worm-like Goa'uld symbiote; no one in the production team wanted nudity in what was intended as a family show, but Showtime, which first aired the series, thought it would spice things up...it didn't, and actually hurt the overall story. Eliminating the most graphic moments now makes the episode 'family-friendly'.

Some redundant and inane dialog has also been eliminated, including my least favorite line in the entire story, when Amanda Tapping tells a room full of male officers that the location of her sexual organs didn't affect her performance of duty (using a bit more graphic terms). It was a dumb line, even in 1997, out of character, and in the script solely for it's shock value. Thanks, Brad, for chopping it!

There are still uncorrected errors; without the Air Force advisor who caught errors in later episodes, there are glaring mistakes in military protocol, and uniforms (I wince, every time I see the scene with an airman wearing both a major's gold leaves AND a staff sergeant's stripes)...I wish these had been addressed, but I assume the budget would only stretch so far.

While there is only one special featurette, a short piece on Brad Wright's reasons for making this edition, the film commentary, by Wright and series star Richard Dean Anderson, is bright and very funny (and reveals that Anderson will be making a surprise appearance on the latest entry in the franchise, ""Stargate Universe""). It's actually worth the price of the DVD, by itself!

""Stargate SG-1: Children of the Gods"" isn't perfect, but it is far better than the original, and Brad Wright has every right to be proud of it!",1248220800,7,2354,4.979643765903308
3881811,4,B0029WLJHK,"Most TV shows spun off from movies are uninvolving and uninteresting (""Blade,"" anyone?), and hopefully die and are forgotten.

That wasn't the case with the spinoff of the 1995 movie ""Stargate,"" an okay science fiction movie that spawned an excellent television series. And ""Stargate SG-1: Children of the Gods -- a recut and polished-up version of the original pilot movie -- is actually far better than it sounds, with a tightened narrative, souped-up special effects (more modern puddles), and a more dramatic soundtrack.

The Stargate has been inactive for a year -- until it is activated, and a bunch of Egyptian-styled warriors come through and kidnap a young officer. General Hammond (Don S. Davis) pulls Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) out of retirement to learn what really happened on the planet of Abydos, and where these mysterious aliens have come from.

O'Neill and a small team go to Abydos and encounter Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) who has been learning about a vast network of Stargates over the past year. But when Daniel's wife Sha're and brother-in-law Skaara are abducted by the same warriors, O'Neill, Jackson and Air Force scientist Sam Carter (Amanda Tapping) use the Stargate to venture to where they're being kept.

What they find is an alien race who inhabits human hosts, the Goa'uld, and their ruthless slave warriors, the Jaffa. Carter, O'Neill and Jackson are captured by the powerful Apophis -- but to escape, they must have the help of an unlikely ally: Teal'c (Christopher Judge), one of the Jaffa.

""Stargate SG-1: Children of the Gods had some beginning-of-series awkwardness, and even the recut scenes don't quite cover this (Teal'c is still an enigma, and the team hasn't quite gelled into the trusting, close-as-family unit). But it shows the seeds of what would become an excellent TV series, both in the overall arc storyline and the standalone episodes.

It also has some wonderfully snappy, tart dialogue, mostly provided by the brilliant O'Neill. The Egyptian-styled sets and effects have a slightly low-budget style, but the script adds some brilliant twists to the original idea, such as hundreds of Stargates scattered through the cosmos. And the makers add some warm scenes, such as the eager Abydonian teenagers celebrating with O'Neill and his pals, which really makes the characters seem human.

As for the recut edition, it's actually not as bad as it sounds; there aren't any George Lucas-style mega changes just for the heck of it (the Abydonians aren't suddenly replaced by screeching dancing CGI bands). It's mostly about tightening up the original episode. The soundtrack is made more dramatically orchestral, and apparently the actors did a bit of rerecorded vocals (honestly, I didn't notice, but I wasn't listening carefully). It also some has some nice behind-the-scenes information about the recut movie and going back to the series' start, and a fun little commentary with Richard Dean Anderson and Brad Wright.

Additionally, dialogue is trimmed off (Sam's silly ""reproductive organs"" spiel) or added back in (""Anyone can send a NOTE!""), the special effects are tweaked (the event horizon has been turned a more luminous blue, and the pyramid matte painting has been replaced), and some alternate takes have been inserted (Sam's audible yelp when Jack shoves her through the Stargate). The most controversial aspect of it is that Share's full frontal nude scene has been removed, which is bad or good depending on your attitude -- apparently the creators never wanted it, but they were forced to.

The cast is also quite good -- Michael Shanks and Richard Dean Anderson have excellent chemistry as the cynical military man and the enthusiastic nerd, both of whom are still struggling with their own personal tragedies. Tapping is also quite good as a capable scientist/soldier, but Judge sadly doesn't get to show much of his formidable range as Teal'c (although you can see little flickers here and there of his awesomeness).

""Stargate SG-1: Children of the Gods"" was a good start to the classic, epic sci-fi series, and despite a few controversial twiddles the ""Final Cut"" is a solid polish-up of the original TV movie. It's not essential, but it's a good complement.",1248134400,20,4243,5.127351664254704
3881812,5,B0029WLJHK,"I don't know about the others on this board, but I have actually watched through the movie, listened to the commentary track, and viewed the featurette. If I have any one complaint, it would be for a longer featurette.

First of all, this is a completely new re-edit. Expositional scenes that are establishing the basis of the series (which are wordy and slow the pace of the original pilot) are trimmed. The action is tighter. The movie has also been re-scored, whereas the pilot contained re-hashed music from the original Stargate feature film. There are also a handful of new shots, improved special effects, and a re-recording of Teal'c's voice (no longer does he have that strange accent that he had in the pilot, but it is now in keeping with the rest of the series).

There is no longer any graphic nudity. Carter no longer makes the cringe-inducing comment about her reproductive organs being on the inside, nor does she say she can ""McGuyver"" anything, and a continuity error has been removed regarding being able to step back through the Stargate once entering (see Apophis' entrance at the beginning of the film).

There are new scenes trimmed from the pilot now restored in this film. In all, this feels like a film and not like a studio pilot. As a result, the entire feature ""feels"" more in keeping with the series as a whole.

Richard Dean Anderson joins the commentary track; all in all, an enjoyable commentary.

The feature is presented in Widescreen 1.78:1 and Dolby 5.1 surround. The quality of the presentation on DVD is much better than the original box set pilot and feels much less ""compressed.""

3881813,1,B0029WLJHK,"For all those repressed people out there who seem completely clueless:  the series was a Showtime series for the first five seasons.  Showtime, you know, that subscription TV channel that you pay for?  Hence, they actually wanted people to watch it, get hooked, etc.  Action, violence, nudity etc.  Did any of you ever even see the feature film?  I'm all for people getting into the series from syndication and from Sci Fi re-runs, but that's not where the show started.  Editing the pilot and removing anything is a mistake, and takes away from the original concept.  I'll wait to see this when it's on Netflix, and save my $$$ for something worth it.",1247875200,8,652,4.707964601769912
3881814,5,B0029WLJHK,"As an SG-1 fan, I have to give Children of the Gods 5 stars by default.  This feature is the beginning of the best and longest sci-fi series ever.  But I also have to agree with one of the other reviewers in that I think it's foolish for them not to put it on both DVD and blu-ray...  I certainly would have bought it....",1247529600,5,321,3.984375

3881816,3,B0029WLJHK,"Not being someone who watches tv (if I can help it), when the regular networks began airing the first two seasons of Stargate SG-1 on Sunday afternoons here a number of years ago, being a big fan of the original film, I watched it whenever possible! They never aired the Pilot Episode on tv and it wasn't till my financial circumstances had improved, that I was able to purchase all the seasons on DVD. When I actually saw the Pilot Epsiode - ""Children of the Gods"" it was good. Certainly not great in comparison to later episodes and seasons once they switched venues from Showtime to Sci-fi.

As far as the nude scene -  The showing of a woman being stripped of her clothing, baring her breasts and pubic hair as she's laid upon a raised platform does not constitute pornography in my view. It's certainly not like the guards or anyone else had their way with her. There was no sexual contact of any kind that I remember seeing, unless I was momentarily out of the room and missed that sequence?

Making a few changes and re-releasing it without the nudity so that we can ausage the desires of the more puritanical citizens of the world is  like a free pass to the ""Garden of Eden"" but wait, weren't Adam and Eve NUDE in the ""Garden of Eden""? Yes, thats true but you can't find that on DVD and if you could, would you still consider it pornography?

With the exception of the few changes (which I'd be interested to see), I'm not going to spend more money for something I already have. Same name in a fluffy new box Wow! If it satisfies the puritans in the world, so be it, we all have to live on this rock together and personal choice is wonderful!",1247184000,22,1651,4.364820846905538
3881817,3,B0029WLJHK,"I have to disagree with those reviewers who say the original nudity was gratuitous and didn't add ANYTHING to the pilot. (certainly nothing gratuitous about the near constant violence in the series, is there?)

The forced nudity most clearly demonstrated just how little the ""gods"" cared for the lives, feelings, and basic humanity of their subjects. By including a few dozen frames of a married woman's forced nudity and inspection by the ""gods"" it clearly dealt with the implied violation and rape to come.  This very effectively demonstrated the level of dominance by the ""gods"" beyond the all too stereo-typical downtrodden slaves/cannon fodder/tortured subjects level so often seen in commercial science fiction fare...as can be seen over and over again in the subsequent Stargate: SG-1 episodes.

Without the Share character's non-consensual nudity the issue of rape and sexual violence against women under the ""gods"" would have never been examined. The later depiction of Share's after-the-fact pregnancy just does not provide the same focus on this topic.

Editing-out the nudity cuts a vital statement and important content out of the product and I think it is weaker for it.

It is nice that a version ""suitable for children"" is available (even though it contains extreme violence and depictions of torture, murder, and death).

It would have been better to be provided both versions in the same disc set so people could compare them or provide the ""safe"" disc to their children as desired.

I also suggest that providing the ""re-imagined"" version in ONLY a ""fullscreen"" format (according to the ""format"" tag in the amazon.com product description) greatly lessens the experience for the viewer.

However, as a well-considered way to enlarge the paying customer-base...re-releasing a ""re-cut, re-mastered, re-imagined, re-markable"" version is a brilliant commercial move.",1247097600,86,1880,5.392491467576792
3881818,5,B0029WLJHK,"None of us can yet review the actual show as it has not yet been released. All of those complaining that this is a rip off because it is the same as the original should wait until it has been released and then view it before being so negative. At least wait until more info is available on the changes.  If you do not want to risk buying it then don't. Certainly many viewers do not watch for the art behind making a show, but just want entertainment. This is likely not for them, and the season box sets will be enough.

Personally, I believe many creators would love to have the chance to re-edit their pilot having both the freedom from producers/studios as well as knowledge of where the story and characters ended up. I very much look forward to seeing the changes and directions that Brad Wright takes this and comparing it to the original. Hopefully, I will learn something about the creative process and fall in love with a new show all over again.  I plan to update this review once I have seen the show.

I am happy to support anything Brad Wright does. The Stargate franchise and the studio has been reasonable in the cost and releases of their DVDs, unlike others who charge outrageous amounts for their shows (ST) or release them in half seasons for more money (BG). So, I do not have a problem with a new release such as this or its cost. The more we support this franchise, the more likely we are to get more direct-to-dvd movies.",1247011200,5,1445,4.380597014925373

3881820,5,B0029WLJHK,At last year's Comic Con Brad Wright mentioned that they were going to re-edit Children of the Gods because he felt that they could have done much better. Wright came to this conclusion after watching it with his Daughter and her boyfriend. This is not just the the nudity that being scrubbed it's whole edit process and different takes will be used for some scenes. Sg1 was originally a Showtime series and thus explaining the nudity. Of Coarse it tanked on showtime and lived out the rest of the Ten Seasons to Come on Scifi.,1246924800,4,527,4.557894736842106
3881821,5,B0029WLJHK,"I was always disappointed about the nude seen. I have all the episodes and the movies. I was always proud the SG1 series was for everyone to enjoy. We all know about special affects, guns are not real etc. however, nudity is real. I would never show my grandchildren the first episode. Some say it is a few seconds, but that few seconds leaves an everlasing impression on children. If I am to own this and have it in my home,I can now have the version I want. It gives me the opportunity to choose. Good Job!!!",1246838400,9,510,4.268041237113402

I may be mistaken but I thought Atlantis was doing well,as well,still trying to grip with why they cancelled both!!!!
Plots get stale...blah blah blah....but both shows were still worth watching....cant speak for other fans but they are still a great escape from my day-to-day grind......I got all of both series on dvd.

8358417,3,B0029WLJHK,"While I applaud the efforts of the studio to make the pilot more like the beloved and well-thought-out show that ran for 10 seasons, correcting some plot holes and slightly editing the full-frontal scene involving Daniel Jackson's wife (so I now don't feel uncomfortable watching it with my children), it was disappointing that they removed some of the things they did.  Like when Sam Carter exclaimed, upon first seeing the DHD, ""We spent years trying to MacGuyver something like this!""  This was a great homage not only to Richard Dean Anderson (Colonel Jack O'Neill), but also to Don S. Davis (General Hammond), who was a stunt double on MacGuyver.  Overall it's fine, and I like that Chris Judge came back and re-recorded his lines thus eliminating that silly accent, but I just wasn't left with the same elated feeling I walked away with when it came to the Re-mastered TOS and the graphically over-hauled ST:TNG blu-rays.",1522627200,,927,4.92948717948718
