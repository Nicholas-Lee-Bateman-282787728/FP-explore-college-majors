3514505,5,B001CO42J8,"This movie is awesome!  It comes with bonus footage, and it arrived so fast!  It was my first time using amazon and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a product they are having a hard time finding in stores.",1229040000,,226,4.357142857142857
3514506,1,B001CO42J8,"Let me say first that, yes, like you, I too adore this warm, wonderful Christmas classic.  No Christmas would seem complete without it.  But it is *because* I love this show (and otherwise would give it five stars without hesitation) that I'm forced to give a one-star review of this particular 2008 remastered/deluxe version.  The reason?  This new version is out of sync.  In other words, the mouth movements of the characters as they speak no longer properly match the actual voices you hear on the audio track.  If you already own this version, watch yours carefully; you'll see what I mean.  There's a noticeable lag.  If you're considering buying this DVD, you might want to wait until Warner Bros. gets its team back to the drawing board and amends this annoying error.  Perhaps such a flaw won't bother some viewers; but if you're like me, it will detract from the beauty of this classic every time you watch.",1229040000,24,917,4.716981132075472
3514507,3,B001CO42J8,"I love this special more than anything. Unfortunately there's TOO much damn remastering. The colors way too vibrant. It's way too clear. I have a hard time having a true nostalgic experience when it looks like it could have been made last year instead of 1969. Believe it or not I prefer my crusty old VHS copy to this remastered dvd. Why do they insist of cleaning everything up. I will give them a little credit. They don't do much to fix the bad sound from the original and there still is a lot of the cell separation in the animation. I just don't understand why they choose to keep SOME of the faults and remove others. Why not come out with an edition that looks the way it originally did when it first aired on television? Anyone interested in that?  Still, I love the special and enjoy sharing it with my [...]daughter, who also adores it.",1228608000,5,847,4.3949044585987265
3514508,5,B001CO42J8,"it is very nice to be able to get these old favorites on DVD and to be able to share them with my grandkids.  The quality on the DVD's was great.

3514509,5,B001CO42J8,"I love it!  This disc is such an improvement over Paramount's disc, both in video and audio, that I don't know where to start.  So I won't.  And, it appears that they did use the first-year version of the film as there were a few animation errors that were cleaned up for the second and subsequent airings, according to the creators.  I'm assuming one of those errors is towards the end when the gang is standing around C.B,s tree and humming.  For one split second, Pig-Pen's head disappears, revealing Patty's dress behind him.  RIOT!  A true American classic.",1225929600,12,562,4.673469387755102
3514510,4,B001CO42J8,"Warner Home Video now owns the Peanuts holiday specials, after years of ownership and video releases by Paramount.  And it will sell - it's a perennial Christmas classic, and deserves every accolade. But...something is missing...

The original sponsor of this special was Coca-Cola, and, like many television programs and specials of the time, had sponsor bumpers in the program. Linus crashed into a ""sponsored by Coca-Cola"" sign, slingshotted his blanket at Coke cans, and the end credits wished us all a ""Merry Christmas from your Coca-Cola bottlers"". Due to broadcast regulation changes, children's programming could no longer include direct sponsoring, and the Coke references disappeared forever after the original broadcast.  Therefore, unless somebody wants to pay Coca-Cola a huge amount of money, you will never see these portions, either restored or as extras for a true collector's edition.  If you own a Paramount copy, don't worry about updating your disc.

Oh, and the greatest Peanuts holiday special is coupled with  the very worst Peanuts holiday special - it has never aired on network television outside of its original broadcast.  The more you know...

A great special, but somebody needs to step up and do this program up in a true collector's edition.",1222732800,15,1274,5.272277227722772
3514511,5,B001CO42J8,This sure sets the mood for the rest of the holidays. What I really enjoy about this is the tunes. I bought the music CD of this show & listen to it all the time at Christmas.

3514612,1,B001CO42J8,This IS NOT the Charlie Brown Christmas you are expecting. This is a collection of shorts and trailers. Do not order this dvd!,1449878400,2,126,4.521739130434782
3514613,1,B001CO42J8,DVD in the case was not the original movie. I'm returning to amazon and hoping my replacement isn't the same way. Just wanted a holiday classic for the family to watch at christmas. Keeping my fingers crossed that they sent my the right movie this time. Not amazons fault. As the case looks like the original movie.,1449878400,6,315,4.543859649122807
3514614,1,B001CO42J8,I didn't even get the right movie in the package,1449187200,4,48,3.9

3514617,1,B001CO42J8,"Like many others, I received the wrong dvd inside the A Charlie Brown Christmas case. Do not buy. Very deceiving!",1449014400,2,113,4.7
3514618,1,B001CO42J8,"Even though the box belongs to ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"", the disc inside is ""Charlie Brown's Christmas Tales"" and is labeled as such.",1448928000,2,136,4.956521739130435
3514619,1,B001CO42J8,"Like a lot of other reviewers, I received the right case with the wrong disc.  (It was for a more recent tv special, ""Charlie Brown's Christmas Tales"".)

Waste. Of. Time. :(",1448928000,5,173,4.548387096774194
3514620,1,B001CO42J8,"Wrong DVD included in the box!  Don't buy this.  The DVD I received is a Charlie Brown Christmas tales, NOT the classic Charlie Brown Christmas.  This listing was totally misleading and a waste of money.",1448928000,3,203,4.742857142857143
3514628,2,B001CO42J8,Like the movie I got but uh ... That's not the one I ordered ;),1448755200,2,63,3.2666666666666666
3514629,1,B001CO42J8,THIS IS NOT the tv show it pretends to be. It is a collection of shorts that have nothing to do with the show that airs on tv.,1448755200,4,126,3.5357142857142856
3514630,1,B001CO42J8,I would give this zero stars if possible. The cover was for Charlie Brown Christmas but the disc was a completely different movie. I will be returning. Buyers beware!,1448668800,5,166,4.758620689655173
3514631,1,B001CO42J8,"DO NOT buy this version. #1 - it does not have A Charlie Brown Christmas even on this DVD. Total false advertising!! It is basically a DVD of the ""extra"" short clips that would be included with the main DVD. What the heck, Amazon?!  #2 - about 25% of the time, the picture was poor quality and pixelated. It was weird. Clearly this was not made in the US and these are being shipped in from another country. Don't waste your money.",1448668800,10,431,4.2560975609756095
3514632,1,B001CO42J8,"Be warned, this is NOT the Charlie Brown Christmas Special from 1965. Just some chopped up garbage they are passing off as a ""remastered"" DVD. The remastering is an edited mish mash of original and added animation. Avoid this one.",1448582400,2,230,4.775
3514633,1,B001CO42J8,Do not order this dvd from Amazon. This is not the classic Charlie Brown Christmas. The dvd is Charlie Browns Christmas tales. Just a few short Christmas clips that are not like the original at all. Very disappointed.,1448582400,3,217,4.7368421052631575
3514634,1,B001CO42J8,"Beware. I should have read the other reviews before purchasing. This DVD does NOT contain the original Christmas program. None of it. Essentially, this is no more than advertising for the real holiday specials. I'd return it, but it will be more satisfying pitching it into the trash. Nasty review, huh? Bummer.",1448496000,9,311,5.0

3514636,1,B001CO42J8,This is NOT the movie that is advertised! It's a small collection of shorts that I have never heard of! The case appears to be for Charlie Brown Christmas but that is NOT the movie in the case! I've never been so upset and left feeling ripped off! This has to be a China knockoff with a mistake this big!!!,1448323200,2,306,4.116666666666666
3514637,5,B001CO42J8,"I wanted this in DVD, I show it to my kids every year and they love it. This is the best one, in my opinion. It was shipped really fast and I was very happy to receive it so quick.",1448150400,,180,3.525
3514638,1,B001CO42J8,Do not buy this version because as others have said the box contains a different DVD that is NOT A Charlie Brown Christmas. Beware. Hey Amazon fix this.,1448150400,4,152,4.464285714285714
3514639,1,B001CO42J8,This is NOT the original Charlie Brown Christmas.  It's random other movies we had never hear of or seen.  Our daughter was extremely disappointing.,1448150400,3,148,5.125
3514640,1,B001CO42J8,Pissed off... this is not a Charlie brown christmas!!! Why does the case say that.. but the disc says Charlie browns christmas tales?,1448064000,3,133,4.826086956521739
3514641,1,B001CO42J8,Not the classic movie!  Very disappointed in this. Was for my 2 year old who was very excited to watch it and its not what was described at all,1448064000,2,143,3.9310344827586206
3514642,1,B001CO42J8,"THIS IS NOT ""A Charlie Brown Christmas""!!!! We just opened our package and the DVD inside says ""Charlie Brown's Christmas Tales"", it's a bunch of unrelated clips, and doesn't even include the actual Charlie Brown Christmas movie!!! So deceptive and false advertising!!!!",1448064000,3,270,5.4523809523809526
3514643,1,B001CO42J8,Not the actual movie.  At least what I got. It says it's the movie on the package but there's no option to play the movie.  Only extra features.  No I'm not making a mistake.  It really only has the extra features.  What the heck.,1448064000,2,230,4.136363636363637
3514644,1,B001CO42J8,"The Charlie Brown Christmas Special is not on the DVD.  It has several Peanuts cartoons. But the main feature advertised on in the add is not what your purchasing

3514646,5,B001CO42J8,"Maybe I can't see past the nostalgia, but I think this really holds up well. There's also a short making-of feature which is worth seeing if you're an animation buff.",1447977600,,166,4.566666666666666
3514647,1,B001CO42J8,"The DVD case is as listed for ""A Charlie Brown Christmas,"" but the disc on the inside is for ""Charlie Brown's Christmas Tales."" I even played the disc to see if the picture on the disc was just mismarked, but it is in fact ""Charlie Brown's Christmas Tales."" I requested an exchange explaining my issue and one was sent right away. However, no one felt that it was imminent that I receive the correct disc the second time around and I received a second copy of ""Charlie Brown's Christmas Tales."" I will be returning the second copy for a full refund. Such a disappointment... was so excited to receive this classic and share it with my family and friends...",1447891200,,656,4.5210084033613445

3514650,1,B001CO42J8,"When I received this in the mail, I opened it and there was a different Charlie Brown Christmas movie inside. The back jacket describes the original Christmas Special, but the movie inside is not the same. It's just a bunch of short episodes. Disappointed. Hoping for a new copy with the right movie in it.",1447632000,,306,4.581818181818182
3514651,1,B001CO42J8,"What a rip off.  I was so excited to find A Charlie Brown Christmas at such a low price.  It arrived and the label on the dvd case was, as seen in the pic, for A Charlie Brown Christmas.  On Christmas Eve, we sat down to watch it as a family.  When I opened the case, the disc said ""Charlie Brown Christmas Tales"".  We played it, even though it didn't seem like what I ordered.  We watched the entire thing, which was a collection of Peanuts shorts with a Christmas theme.  NONE OF THEM WERE A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS.  We ended up donating it to the local library.",1447545600,,565,4.166666666666667

3514847,5,B001CO42J8,"I bought this DVD as an early Christmas gift for myself, and I must say I really like this edition a lot better than Paramount's edition (which I owned a long time ago). I'll compare Paramount's release to this one released by Warner Bros.

Paramount release (first DVD release of CB Xmas, released in Y2K):
-No special features whatsoever
-Poor sound quality
-No other language audio tracks, other than English

Warner Bros. release (2nd release, released in 2008):
-Has a making of documentary
-Various language tracks
-Better sound quality

All in all, the WB release wins over that of Paramount's. This re-release is also cheaper as far as pricing is concerned, and I will definitely buy more Peanuts specials on DVD and Blu-Ray from Warner Bros. in the future!",1390176000,,765,4.9147286821705425

3514920,1,B001CO42J8,"The original ""Charlie Brown Christmas"" from 1965 has been much beloved from its very first airing, for very good reasons. So it was horrifying to watch the ""deluxe"" dvd version only to discover the soundtrack has been altered. Specifically, the new track is peppered with new music in many places where once there was only dialog. The dialog completely loses its power, appeal, and humor in those spots because the distracting music steps all over it.

Get this dvd for the interesting ""Making Of"" special, but true fans of the original will want to look for an earlier dvd or vhs where hopefully the original charming audio is still intact.",1387324800,8,641,4.827272727272727

3514924,5,B001CO42J8,"...and one that we are never too old or young to enjoy!

No matter how many times I watch: A Charlie Brown Christmas, it still makes me smile and lifts my spirits.

 When I was younger, this show was a regular part of the TV holiday line-up every year. I don't watch regular TV anymore, but I don't think that's the case anymore, which is unfortunate. Luckily, it IS still available as a DVD and instant download.

The true and special spirit of the holidays, along with all the fun characters, music and amazing graphics that is part of the whole Charlie Brown collection. This one in particular, is a keeper that has stood the test of time.

I really hope that parents with young children now are still sharing Charlie's and Linus' special message with them. So many of the current holiday movies seem so lifeless, predictable and downright boring.

Charlie Brown still tops the Christmas must-watch list, as far as I'm concerned! :<)

PS: I can't comment on the audio or video quality of this DVD as I have an older VHS version (still works fine). Hopefully the complaints about this issue in other reviews here, have been resolved.",1386633600,,1135,4.616915422885572

It was great because I had to show the movie at the Youth Group I head up and it said the latest the movie would come in was that Friday (the day AFTER I needed to show it). But luckily it came in a day BEFORE I needed which was excellent! I got it in the mail and played it on my dvd player to check it out. It was magnificent! They color, the sound, and everything else was amazing!- probably even better than when it first came on tv. I liked how it came with an extra show from the Peanuts gang and it even had a documentary. I learned many things about A Charlie Brown Christmas that I didn't even know or would of thought about!

3515061,5,B001CO42J8,"If I had to single out one Christmas movie favorite, I'd have to pick A Charlie Brown Christmas. So, my review is a little biased.
I just think it's a cute, straightforward, and humorous take on the Christmas season. It brings all our favorite Peanuts characters out at their best, and it makes light of the stress and struggle that we all seem to feel a little of a Christmas - then, brings it home with the most honest recognition of what Christmas is all about. How about that for a 26 minute run-time animated movie?!

This is a great edition of the movie as well - excellent picture quality, excellent sound quality (VINCE GUARALDI IS AWESOME!!!) - there is a bonus feature movie on the DVD as well but I didn't even get to it, nor did I get to any of the other special features, but I'm pretty sure there are quite a few on this DVD.

Also, I bought direct from Amazon, and I have to give yet another shout-out to the prices and especially the shipping. If you are an Amazon Prime member: they offered me free overnight shipping OR free two day shipping + and Amazon Instant Movie credit instead. I took the 2-day shipping plus credit and I STILL got my movies the next day! I hope they keep offering that.",1357084800,,1212,4.334801762114537

And what's a Christmas play w/o a tree? Everyone makes fun of the short sparse ""nevergreen tree"" that he comes up with, until Christmas works it's true magic.

This is a classic family holiday film. It has all the characters that we have known and loved our whole lives. This DVD also contains the ""It's Christmastime Again Charlie Brown"" story.

And also on how Charlie Brown found a tree that no one else thought was special,but he knew it was. Like i said Great film for Christmas time or not,and for the price you can't beat that.

3515112,5,B001CO42J8,"""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" is beautifully presented in DVD format here.  This is the classic 1965 Christmas special that we all remember, and I enjoyed watching this remastered edition.  My copy had none of the audio issues reported by others, and it looked good visually as well.  I found the bonus feature, detailing the making of the special, to be interesting and engaging; it was fun to see behind-the-scenes of how this classic came to be.  The only part of this Deluxe Edition that I did NOT finding particularly worthwhile was the included sequel, ""It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown"" (1992).  This feature lacked all of the charm of the original.  However, because it was a bonus, it doesn't detract from my overall impression of this DVD, which I would definitely recommend if you are wanting to collect this Christmas classic.",1325548800,4,843,4.985714285714286

Everyone knows the story of Charlie Brown and the meaning of Christmas.  A timeless tale that still rings true today.  The music of the late great Jazz musician Vince Guiraldi ""Christmas Time Is Here"" is outstanding and remains as a timeless Christmas tune.  Charlie, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy, and Sally are still awesome today as they were in 1965.  Christmas's of years past go by too quickly, but this timeless classic does not.  I look forward to watching it every Christmas Season, and will for years to come.  Most HIGHLY Recommended!",1323734400,3,652,4.91743119266055
3515116,5,B001CO42J8,This is such a wonderful kids movie. It is so great to have something you can pull out every year around Christmas and watch it with the whole family.,1323475200,,150,4.206896551724138
3515117,5,B001CO42J8,"..it is one of the very, very few Christmas holiday specials that dares to explain the true, ""true meaning of Christmas"", the birth of the lord and savior Jesus Christ in a humble manger, brought into the world to die for our sins and be gloriously resurrected.  My goodness, how did Charles Schulz ever get this animated episode past the censors in the '60s?  Perhaps there was still residual religious and charitable feeling then.

Oh, Charlie Brown, your condemnation of Christmas cupidity, materialism, and carnal cheer would be even harsher today, and sadly, more ignored today!  You would even get embroiled in the ""Christmas vs. Holiday"" controversy, encountered by Governor Lincoln Chafee in Rhode Island, for example.  You might even despair, and you might need Linus's gentle, matter-of-fact guidance even more.  Some believe Jesus to be non-existent, or at least an actual but mythologized figure.  Whether we do or not, ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" is nevertheless instructive.  It reminds us that what the world needs more than ever is faith, hope, charity, and kindness for ALL.  You showed us that, Charlie and Linus, embodiments of reason and spirituality.  Thank you.",1323388800,4,1183,5.178947368421053

3515119,5,B001CO42J8,"Some films are so groundbreaking and original that you have to remark that you will not see anything like it at all again. Well, this special is exactly that. It's one of those films that has a effect on everybody from age one to 120. It defined a era where everything was simple and too the point. Also, it had the message that everybody seeked yet it wasn't murky not to see it. It is one of my favorite childhood films of all time and it's a joy to sit down and watch it every year with the family. It's the only Christmas film to make me excited for the season and yet still enjoy why we do celebrate. It's not one of those christmas films you see churned out every year that exploits the season and only has money to gain. I mean, this movie is anti commercial because it's saying that we lost our way in the hustle and bustle of getting gifts for everybody that we have lost the true meaning in WHY we get the gifts. Charlies Shultz could create the most simplistic characters that you could see yourself it. It's a film that needs to be locked into a vault and stored in for protection just so future generations that get lost in the season can simply unearth it and find out why Christmas exists.",1321747200,,1204,4.239130434782608

3515133,5,B001CO42J8,"Aside from the fact that A Charlie Brown Christmas is a seminal Christmas Special, can you imagine if CBS had decided NOT to air it???? In the words of Charlie Brown, ""ARRRRRGH!!""  The suits at CBS didn't like it at first and didn't even want to air it but thank God for the almighty buck because they decided since they had spent the money, they might as well air it...I won't give anymore away, but one of the extras on this DVD is a wonderful set of interviews with people like Bill Melendez, the director, Mrs. Charlies Schultz, Fred Silverman (CBS exec in charge of programming), and many more.",1295222400,,599,4.495412844036697

3515137,5,B001CO42J8,"""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" is simply an enchanting tale that was first broadcast on CBS in December, 1965. Since its original network airing this cartoon classic has been televised on American network television every single year, now being broadcast on ABC, for other generations of children to enjoy. The message in this special is clear: Christmas isn't about shopping, price tags, and plain ole commercialism; it's about Jesus' Birthday and loving mankind and is a time to be with friends and family.

 Upon watching ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" the viewer realizes the greatest animated techniques were not used, but I believe this adds to the innocence of the cartoon. Remember this was made in the early sixties when most televised programs were filmed in black and white and advances in film were several years away. Still, this little special featuring Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy, and the rest of the Peanuts gang has always held a special place in my heart. It is not the Holidays for me without watching Charlie and his cohorts celebrating the Holidays.

 The print is beautiful and the DVD and Blue Ray comes with a neat featurette on the making of the special. Merry Christmas!",1293062400,,1198,4.975
3515138,5,B001CO42J8,This is a timeless Christmas classic that still brings a lump to your throat. The music from this special is wonderful as well. A classic!,1292976000,,138,4.56
3515139,5,B001CO42J8,"What can I say?  Christmas is not Christmas until I've seen ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" at least once!  I've already watched it at least twice this year, and I must say that the remastered version is much sharper (and, of course, easier to handle) than my old VCR tape.  I can isolate my favorite scenes (Snoopy dancing on the piano; Linus explaining the true meaning of Christmas, which sends  Charlie Brown skipping merrily home with his tree in his hand) and play these again and again.  And, of course, there's the music!  The instrumental version of ""Christmas Time is Here"" sets the mood for the holiday, as does ""Skating"" and ""Oh Tannenbaum.""

In fact, just writing this review makes me want see ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" once again!",1292630400,,742,4.75
3515140,5,B001CO42J8,"""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" has become a staple of holiday specials since its first broadcast in 1965.  Its staying power can be attributed to its heartwarming story and simple message, along with Charles Schutz's wonderful peanuts gang, including superdog Snoopy.

As the story opens, Charlie Brown is overwhelmed by the commercialism of the Christmas season.  Lucy, in her recuring role as streetcorner phychologist, guides him to a role as director of the school Christmas play.  That works out about as well as it usually does, but it leads Charlie Brown to a fateful encounter with a Christmas tree that needs a home, and to Linus' famous explanation of the Christmas spirit.  ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" is short, sweet, and enjoyable by all ages; highly recommended.",1291766400,,773,5.152
3515151,3,B001CO42J8,"I write this assuming you already know the story A Charlie Brown Christmas. Be warned that the audio on the Warner Bros version is a half second ahead of the video. It is more noticeable on the sounds (tapping of the aluminum tree, tossing of the directors horn) than on the dialog. This seems to only apply to the Warner Bros DVD, and not the Blu Ray.

I am not sure if I like the video on the Warner Bros either. It is a sharper image; but it also seems to be a negative quality.

This is a Christmas special that people watch every year. If I knew then what I know now, I'd have purchased the Paramount version from http://www.amazon.com/Charlie-Brown-Christmas-Ann-Altieri/dp/B00004W5UM/ref=sr_1_3?s=dvd&ie=UTF8&qid=1291690784&sr=1-3 .

When he gets a crappy little Christmas tree for the play, everyone is mad at him, and wants to know what Christmas is all about.

3515160,5,B001CO42J8,"A Charlie Brown Christmas can be best described as ""classic."" It may not be as excellent as It's A Wonderful Life or Home Alone, but it's truly one of the great TV specials that has become a staple for this holiday season. Like many other Christmas specials, I always find myself in high spirits whenever I watch this. Most of the characters from Peanuts are here; the voices are surprisingly effective. The animation is quite simplistic, but it's still beautifully drawn. The humor is very appropriate for this time of year: it's very light and never offensive (if you want crude and offensive, check out Christmas Time in South Park on DVD!). The message is plain and simple: Christmas isn't always about toys and decorations, but most importantly, it's always about the birth of Jesus Christ. I may not be religious, but I'm always moved when Linus explains what Christmas is all about with his truly unforgettable monologue. The monologue itself is delivered in a very straightforward manner, but I think that's the point. It's not dull, nor is it melodramatic. And I think it's the biblical text that makes it all the more powerful.

You should definitely check out A Charlie Brown Christmas if you haven't already. It may be only half an hour long, but overall, it's funny and heartwarming.",1261440000,,1296,4.837837837837838
3515161,2,B001CO42J8,"Charlie is depressed about how materialistic Christmas is. Lucy makes him the director of the play to cheer him up, but he is soon depressed that no one will listen to him because they are busy having fun and he isn't.  He proceeds to get a bad tree and then is depressed, and surprised for some reason, when no one likes it.  Linus tells everyone the real meaning of Christmas (only redeeming quality in the movie). Charlie goes home and tries to spruce up his tree but it doesn't work mainly because he doesn't really try very hard anyway.  Everyone uses Snoopy's decorations stripped from his doghouse, that he worked very hard on, to finally fix Charlie Brown's tree just to make him happy. The entire movie is about Charlie Brown putting forth this vibe that he is entitled to be happy, and everyone must fall over backwards to make his Christmas a happy one not caring who he steps on in order to get there.

Vince makes some great music though, and is the main reason for the second star.",1261094400,3,995,4.480662983425415
3515162,5,B001CO42J8,"A Charlie Brown Christmas was a TV special by ABC back in the mid 1960s.

I have not watched this in some time.  The cartoon is not just about Charlie Brown being depressed and called a blockhead (although that inevitably happens).  It's a message about what Christmas is really all about.

The cartoon acknowledges commercialism (Christmas is run by a big Eastern conglomerate!) but is totally okay with thumbing its collective animated nose at that and instead involves the viewer into the true meaning of Christmas.

There is a jab at the psychiatric industry as well.  Lucy gets her nickel from Charlie Brown and then says, ""Let's see what's wrong with you and then we can put a label on it.""  And then she proceeds to list all kinds of phobias.  Funny stuff.

The Christmas play is great, with awesome jazzified Christmas music by Vince Guaraldi as composer, and Linus' speech on stage.

This special had Coca Cola as the main sponsor and so some scenes were cut that had the Coca Cola parts in it.

So as Linus warns Charlie Brown, don't make Christmas a problem and just enjoy it.  The TV special really shows the simplicity of Christmas.

The remastered picture is cleaner than the previous issue on DVD.  The sound, however, has some trouble.  For one, the synch is noticeably off.  Watching, I thought something wasn't quite right.  It wasn't until Schroeder and Lucy's Jingle Bells scene that I was sure there was a problem.  I even dug up my old VHS copy to verify.  When an annoyed Schroeder plays the toy-piano version of Jingle Bells, the old copies have a perfectly synched presentation, with each movement of his hand resulting in one note, dead on.  The new version's synch is off to an alarming and annoying degree.  Also, I was more impressed with the audio quality on the VHS copy.  In short, the best part of this new issue is the packaging.  If you want one copy for watching, go with the older issue.  If you are a collector, get this one for the package and keep the older version for viewing.",1230076800,3,1043,4.4787234042553195
