5463732,5,B00AP88IWY,Seriously you couldn't ask for a better workout!!! As a busy mom of 4 when I workout I need to get the most for the short time I have and this workout really delivers!! I am lucky enough to be a part of the R & D group for these workouts and after the first time I was hooked.  I felt both challenged and encouraged through out this very difficult workout and I saw that each time I made the commitment I felt stronger.  I have more energy and have already lost 5 pounds!,1355875200,4,471,4.0
5463733,5,B00AP88IWY,"These workouts are no joke! I have been working out steadily for over a year now, doing some pretty intense workouts, and yet, these totally have me huffing and puffing and have gotten me whipped into the best shape of my life.  I can see muscle definition in places that I haven't before and I can totally see the ""leaning out"" process taking place.  I feel amazing! I'd give this program 10 stars!",1355875200,6,399,4.4520547945205475
5463734,5,B00AP88IWY,I have been a fan of Lindsay's for a few years now and was thrilled to hear that she was releasing some more advanced workouts! I got the privilege of being part of her research and development group and have to say that it has whipped me into shape. The workouts are challenging but fun. I am always dripping sweat when I'm done and just have loved the awesome feeling they have given me. There is a great amount of variety and she is super fun and motivating! Would definitely recommend these workouts!,1355875200,6,504,4.43010752688172
5463735,5,B00AP88IWY,"When I first started the fitness training, I thought I would curl up on the floor & die after the first ten minutes.  It went for 40.  But it got better... by the next time it was on the schedule, I finished it in plenty of time before the girls had finished and could have done a little more so I stuck in a ab workout.  This program works - with some serious dedication for a few weeks & doing at least a little caloring counting, you can easily shed some of the love handles you've been holding to.  Love Lindsay's yoga, positive attitude & NO SWEARING... what more could a mom with little kids around need?  (Maybe new clothes on the way!!)",1355788800,15,644,4.203252032520325
5463736,5,B00AP88IWY,Absolutely love these workouts! I lost 5 lbs in two weeks and can see a huge difference in my muscle definition! 6 months postpartum and in the best shape of my life! These are a must have!,1355788800,15,189,4.135135135135135
5463737,5,B00AP88IWY,"I was part of the R&D group for Pretty Fierce: Lean Out, and this program takes you to the next level of fitness.  It is challenging and FUN at the same time.  Lindsay Brin and her team of Moms Into Fitness worked it!  I saw fantastic results and loved the challenge!!!",1355788800,3,269,4.235294117647059
5463738,5,B00AP88IWY,I am part of the Research & Development for this workout program. I've been a loyal user of Lindsay's DVDs for 3 years now. This is by far the most challenging and rewarding program! Her constant motivation keeps you going and the intensity of the workout makes it go by so quickly. I started seeing results after week two! I highly recommend this program!,1355788800,3,356,4.578125
5463739,5,B00AP88IWY,I took part in the r&d for this program and I love it!! I have tried everything from P90X to gym classes and nothing was ad fun or gave me the results I got from lean out!!!!!,1355788800,2,175,3.7567567567567566
5463740,5,B00AP88IWY,"Love Lindsay Brin's workouts, instruction, and the MIF encouragement.  The workouts are so good, my hubby who is an exercise physiology major will do them on the rare day he can't get to the gym or outside!",1421539200,2,206,4.5675675675675675
5463741,3,B00AP88IWY,The endurance workouts are great but one of my strength workouts was not playing the correct workout.  I also find the aerobic capacity boring.  Tough workouts but could useore variety.,1420588800,,185,5.133333333333334
5463742,5,B00AP88IWY,I cannot thank Lindsey enough for her workouts. These workouts are not only challenging but fun too. Thanks again Lindsey.,1398816000,,122,5.15
5463743,5,B00AP88IWY,"I have done many 60 days systems (Insanity, T25, TurboFire) and have seen results, so I was looking for another challenge when I stumbled across Lindsay Brins Pretty Fierce. I downloaded her free video and thought I would give it a go. I was so impressed I purchased Pretty Fierce Lean Out right after my workout!! I am now on week 6 of 8 and I am loving what it is doing to my body!! Lindsay is motivating, provides tons of support and challenges the body every week.  She makes you feel like you are working out with a good friend! I am also a runner and I love that her system allows for personal run days so that I can continue my training. I cannot wait to order Pretty Fierce X when I am done! Keep up the fantastic work Lindsay!!!",1394236800,3,737,4.190140845070423
5463744,5,B00AP88IWY,"I'm 2 weeks away from finishing Lindsay Brin's Pretty Fierce:  Lean Out and I love the workouts and the results I'm seeing.  I really appreciate the effort Lindsay takes to demonstrate proper technique and the reminders to keep good form when the moves get tough.  It's nice that she is a mom and understands our schedules and challenges that face us while trying to loose weight and tone.  Out of all the workouts I've done, I have seen the best results in my hips and waist.  I look forward to completing the program and plan on doing it again with heavier weights.",1393372800,4,567,4.519607843137255
5463745,5,B00AP88IWY,"I just had my first baby 10 months ago and worked out with Lindsay all pregnancy long. Post-baby, I have loved her Bootcamp DVDs and just finished ""Lean Out"" today. I never thought I'd get my body back, but with bootcamp I was back to my pre-pregnancy weight by 10 weeks. With Lean Out, I feel stronger and have more endurance than ever. I can't speak more highly of this program. I've recommended her DVDs to anyone who'd listen! I've done P90X, Jillian Michaels, Insanity and so many others- nothing got me into shape like the Lean Out program...I drop 1 min and 24 secs off my fit test run. Something I never thought I could do! The best thing about this program is it's manageable. All the workouts are less than an hour, but most are under 40 minutes. I highly recommend this DVD set.",1390780800,7,789,4.410958904109589
5463746,5,B00AP88IWY,"These are the best workout DVDs I've ever used.  I tried the P90x system but found that those DVDs just waste too much time.  The ""workout"" takes up an hour to an hour and a half and I found there was lots of waiting between exercises and while you waited for the people on the DVD to crank out 100s of pull-ups to your 20.  I wasn't getting an intense workout with all that on/off and it was still taking forever.
I had Lindsay Brin's CFS method DVD and found that to be good so I went for it on these. (I did, however, get them half price on babysteals.com--they run that special occasionally so watch for it.)
Her workouts remind me of P.E. back in school.  Lots of variety and many exercises crammed into the short time (most workouts are ~30mins).  I like that they have the timer counting down in the corner so I can see how much longer I have to endure.  I also like that the bottom of the screen shows you what is coming up next.  Also helps the time pass for me.  Not that I'm not enjoying the workout, they are just fairly intense.  I have had knee pain in the past but I have never had a problem with these workouts causing pain.  Even with some intense jumping on some of the workouts.  If you following Lindsay's instructions on form and wear good shoes, you should be fine.  And, only feel the ""good"" kind of pain.  There is such a variety to the workouts, I never get bored.  I look forward to doing the DVD's each morning.  I am on my 3rd time through the series.  If you are considering these DVD's, go for it.  You won't regret it!",1382572800,6,1549,4.179054054054054
5463747,5,B00AP88IWY,"I am the mother of 4 and Lindsay's DVDs helped my 4 finger width Diastis Recti return back to a 1 finger width, which is normal! I have seen amazing results with my body using her DVDs. I really enjoyed the PF Weight Loss- though hard, it wasn't impossible and I lost 10-12 pounds with that program. I thought I was ready for PF Lean Out and I don't know- it is TOUGH! Now I'm only on Day 3- but wow, the exercise program is really tough and I have to break here an there- just can't keep up. HOWEVER, I like that I can't keep up and have something to work towards. With the PF Weight Loss, it was challenging too but I could do it and after completing the program I was ready for something new. I hope I can complete PF Weight Loss b/c it will definitely do great things for my body. Four stars is because I like it but am not loving it yet. May update this post later :)

UPDATE****Since my last review I completed the Pretty Fierce program. I lost 6 lbs- which may not seem like a lot- but I didn't have a lot to lose at any rate. However, I did lose 3 inches off of my hips and several off the rest of my measurements as well. So that is the most telling for me. I also noticed that when I went back to the Pretty Fierce Weight Loss discs they were significantly easier though still challenging! I restarted the Pretty Fierce Weight loss as I like having a set schedule.

I think I would have lost a lot more weight if I watched my nutrition better- but like I said I did not have much to lose to begin with and I'm still around 124 at 5'5''. I got down to 120 but the holidays arrived just in time :)Apps like Fitness Pal to help keep track of your nutrition help quite a bit! Overall, I love both programs, I'm stronger, my tummy is flat (after 4 kids that says a ton), and these work outs help me keep the pounds off and the stress at bay! You won't regret your purchase.",1381536000,18,1878,4.032171581769437
5463748,4,B00AP88IWY,"I'm just starting this workout program, and so far, so good.  Workouts are pretty intense, which is what I'm looking for.  I did the first 30 days of Insanity when I was about 3 months post partum and liked it, but felt like I was working too hard for too little results...wasn't helping enough with strength and toning.  This seems like it's going to be a perfect combo of cardio and strength work.  My only complaint so far is the repetitiveness of some of the workouts.  The aerobic capacity workout, for instance, just repeats the same circuit 5 times!!  I assumed that maybe it would repeat three times and then start another routine to repeat.  But no, just the same circuit five times.  I stopped halfway into the fourth just out of boredom.  Then it abruptly ends with the words ""Cool down on your own.""  Weird.

UPDATE: I just want to update saying that, after several months of working out with these DVDs, I really love this workout program.  I haven't actually pursued it as a whole 60 day program (though I'm sure they are great for that and I might someday when I am just a *little* more focused in my workout routine), but just use the workouts I want when I want.  There are some that I like more than others--if you'll see above, I don't really like the aerobic workout, but the upper and lower body strength and endurance workouts are awesome.  They pack such a great punch for only 30 min workouts.  For those longer workout days, Total Body Strength is amazing too.  I feel like just doing a workout from this series every other day or every couple of days has gotten me in great shape.",1376265600,9,1606,4.4673539518900345
5463749,5,B00AP88IWY,"Seriously can't say enough about Lindsay and her products. If you want results, get her dvds. After having my son in 2007, I'd sunk into thinking I needed to just accept the fact I could never be truly happy with my after-baby body...  but let me tell you my life has changed since finding her. I feel INCREDIBLE and my husband comments on the ""results"" daily :) SO worth it!",1370217600,13,375,4.357142857142857
5463750,5,B00AP88IWY,"Lindsay Brin's Pretty Fierce Lean Out program is a must-do for any and all fitness enthusiasts looking for a fresh, efficient and effective challenge.

I'm an avid follower of Lindsay Brin's at-home methods because she designs programs specifically for moms who don't have the luxury of carving out a ton of time towards their fitness goals. This program is no exception and, in my opinion, the best on the market. I have never been so challenged in intensity, strength and endurance. I have tried countless high intensity workouts over the years and this series has it all. You won't be disappointed. Results are imminent.",1368144000,6,623,4.990384615384615
5463751,5,B00AP88IWY,"I lost 7 lbs, 13 inches overall, and smashed my fitness test by the end of the 9 weeks. I loved the variety and intensity of the program. Most workouts are under 40 min which is great because I don't have a lot of time. I love all of Lindsay's DVDs that I've tried and this series is by far my favorite yet.",1365033600,10,307,3.888888888888889
5463752,5,B00AP88IWY,"I am on week 4 of this series, and it has exceeded all expectations. I am a 37 year old mom who has always been pretty fit; I'm now in the best shape of my life. This is a group of videos that comes with a calendar and nutritional support. Absolutely recommend - it's challenging but fun.",1364860800,9,288,4.0701754385964914
5463753,5,B00AP88IWY,"I have this and Pretty Fierce: Weight Loss and really love both sets of workouts.  Lindsay makes the workouts tough, but effective and it is clear that these are not typical workouts that are normally geared toward moms.  As someone who works full-time, I often rely on the Total Body Express portion, although the three endurance workouts have pushed my overall fitness to the next level.  I only wish I had these videos when my kids were younger, as this would have been the focused, purposeful workouts that I needed!",1362614400,7,520,4.7555555555555555
5463754,5,B00AP88IWY,"I have been doing Lindsay workouts for about three years now, both pregnant and not, and they just keep getting better. She ups the intensity every time.  Like other reviewers, I've done P90X and Insanity and even (don't judge me) Brazilian Butt Lift.  The Pretty Fierce workouts surpass many of those in intensity and target my first requirement in any workout:  efficiency.  Lindsay does not waste any time getting your heart rate up and making you sweat in this series of videos. It was a little overwhelming when I first started Total Body Endurance, as the moms on the screen flew through their exercises, and I was still one or two behind, but I realized I don't want to be as good or as fast as the experts on screen - I want to be able to work towards something and get better each time.  I still can't go as fast as them, but I'm getting closer! Also like many others, I work out early in the morning before anyone is up in my house, and I don't want to get up any earlier than I absolutely have to - so getting a full body workout in that leaves me dripping with sweat in 40ish minutes cannot be valued highly enough. I know some people I've talked to are nervous about trying these, especially after I compared them to Insanity, but Lindsay does have free trials of them on her website to give them a try before buying them. As much as I liked the workouts video series like P90X offer, I really don't have 60+ minutes to workout every day for 90 days in a row.  Lindsay's workouts get it done in half the time while targeting my least favorite ""mom"" areas of my body (I'm looking at you, flabby thighs).",1359504000,41,1615,4.33112582781457
5463755,5,B00AP88IWY,"Being a mom is crazy and these workouts made it possible for me to get in a good workout and still have time to get all the other mom things done!  I was part of the R&D for this series, and it challenges me often.  Live it!",1357344000,2,224,3.74468085106383
5463756,5,B00AP88IWY,"What can I say, this workout is awesome! It will get you results. I started to lose weight my first week into this program. I could not believe it as that does not come easily for me. I am within a few pounds of my goal weight, so I have to work extra hard to see the scale budge.  I have done P90x and various other ""hardcore"" workouts, but I can honestly say that they have nothing on the Total Body Endurance and Total Body Strength workouts in this series. Wow! That being said, you will still find yourself wanting more because Lindsay Brin is great at providing variety and mixing it up so that you don't get bored. In addition, it is fun to see your body transform and the feeling of accomplishment when you realize you are able to complete workouts that seemed impossible the first time.

I am currently in the research and development group for this program and am on week six. I love it and was thrilled to be a part of it. In my opinion, you can't go wrong with any Lindsay Brin workout, but this one will really get your body to that top fitness level. She works it all, strength, endurance, aerobic and anaerobic. If you want to be more fit and tighten up, this is the workout for you. It will challenge you and you will feel amazing as you notice results in the mirror, on the scale, measurements and your basic endurance for exercise. It is empowering!

So if you are still waiting to buy this, don't! Lindsay is the most likable workout guru you will ever have the pleasure of working out too. She is up on her research and really knows how to get you the most effective workouts possible, without devoting half of your day to working-out.  I have all of her prior DVD's and downloads. I can't say enough good about her or her products. I get asked about my workout routine and I can't wait to brag about Lindsay.

Lindsay will make the most of your workout time, especially in this series. She is a down to earth likable woman. I was first inspired by her when I learned she was a mother and did a blog about getting her body back, and as you can see her body is AMAZING! I saw her stomach and said I need to do whatever she does. I wasn't wrong. My stomach is tighter and I can even seem some muscle definition.  I have confidence that if I am doing her workouts and following her recommended calendar, I am getting the most of my workout time and will stay in good shape.  When I have a few too many trips to the desert trays and notice my pants are a bit tight. I go straight back to her workouts and get results. This one is no different, and I know that I myself have noticed the most change with my fitness level with this series.  Try it, you can't lose (well...only weight).",1356652800,9,2699,4.237354085603113
5463757,5,B00AP88IWY,"I am in week 5 of 9 in this workout and I love it! The workouts are challenging but doable. Even though I have been working out for a while, I found these tough! I love that there is so much variety! I never get bird because there are so many different workouts. The workouts range from 15 minutes to an hour- totally fits into my busy mom life! I love the convience of a home video plus the meal plan to stay on track. I love that there are options also. For the anaerobic workout days, I can choose to do the video or run- which I prefer for variety. I can already tell I am faster on my 3 mile run and can see definition in my arms and abs! Awesome!",1356480000,5,652,3.9097744360902253
5463758,5,B00AP88IWY,"This work out is the most challenging program I've ever done and I love it. I have done almost all of Lindsay's other programs and I jumped at the chance to be part of the R&D team for Lean Out. If you want to challenge yourself to get a better body and get in better shape, do not hesitate. Buy this program!!  You feel so amazing after you get your workout completed each day. Lindsay and her team are so motivating and encouraging and they push you to go harder. You won't regret trying this program!",1356048000,2,503,4.239583333333333
5463759,5,B00AP88IWY,"I have been a huge Lindsay Brin fan ever since being introduced to her trimester-specific prenatal workouts and her first Postnatal Bootcamp DVD, which were part of my course curriculum when I studied for my Pre/Postnatal Exercise Specialist Certification with American Fitness Professionals and Associates. I missed being a part of the Research and Development team for the initial Pretty Fierce: Weight Loss program because I was either still pregnant or very newly postpartum when that R&D took place, but I was super excited to be selected to participate in R&D for Lean Out. I began the program a little over 4 months post-baby #3, who arrived via my third C-section. I'd worked out throughout my pregnancy (including with Lindsay's prenatal workouts, among other programs) and resumed exercise soon after delivery. In my first few months postpartum, I mostly focused on weight training and mixed in a little running and other moderate-intensity cardio. I did very little HIIT. When I started Lean Out, I remember thinking, ""Wow, I thought I was in decent shape!"" The first few Total Body Endurance workouts kicked my booty! But in a good way! I am only three weeks into this program, but I can already feel an improvement in my cardiovascular capacity as I complete the workouts. I love that she packs so much into such a short time, keeping all of the workouts well under an hour, with some closer to half an hour. I am a busy mom, so I want a workout that hits strength and cardio conditioning in one and leaves me feeling like I really spent my time wisely - and this workout does that. I can't wait to see my results when I finish this program and am already recommending it to others without hesitation!",1355875200,4,1714,4.774410774410774
8555642,3,B00AP88IWY,"So far I have loved this boxed set.  However, I just tried the lower body strength disc for the first time and it appears that the video is lower body strength but the audio is for lower body endurance. The audio doesnt match the video at all and Lindsay even introduces the work out as lower body endurance in the audio, even though the video part is totally different and doesnt match the audio at all.",1527379200,,404,4.315789473684211
8555643,5,B00AP88IWY,"I've done several Beachbody programs (P90x and sequels, Insanity and sequels) and I think this program is equally good, especially if you push yourself during every workout. Not much beats the original P90x for improving pull-up performance, and the cardio workouts are not quite as insane feeling as Insanity workouts, but overall the intensity is high and the variety is very good. I liked that outdoor running workouts are integrated into the program. My 2-mile run improved by at least 2 minutes over the 60 days. I also like Lindsay Brin and her style. Some workouts feel a bit repetitive, but most programs are like that.

One of my discs didn't work (mismatched audio and video from different workouts) and I wasn't in a place where a replacement could be sent, but they were very good about giving me online access.",1524873600,,823,4.836879432624113
8555644,5,B00AP88IWY,"I love the Lindsay Brin workouts I have (I also have&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pretty-Fierce-Weight-Loss-with-Lindsay-Brin-Moms-Into-Fitness/dp/B00AP88IYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pretty Fierce: Weight Loss with Lindsay Brin & Moms Into Fitness</a>&nbsp;and some of her core workouts), and have definitely gotten into better shape thanks to Lindsay. Pretty Fierce: Weight Loss was a great set for me to start with after the birth of my seventh child (he was about 9 months old when I started), and once I felt like I needed a bit more I moved on to this one. Even after two run-throughs of this workout using the schedule provided, it is still pretty tough. Though I will say I am at least no longer feeling like my arms and legs may not be up to much like I was when I did this workout the first time through! Now that I've been through the schedule on this one twice, I have been mixing it up a bit with some of the workouts from Weight Loss, as well as some Ellen Barrett DVDs I have.

First off, this workout is intense. If you have not been working out regularly, this is not the set to start with. I found Pretty Fierce: Weight Loss to be a great set for me to start with, but it is possible that even that one might be too hard for some early on. As Lindsay tends to say in a lot of her workouts, listen to your body, you know what's best for you. But I will say this is definitely not a beginner set. The majority of the workouts in this set are of a high intensity and much more difficult than the Weight Loss set. Some of the workouts may be a bit long if you're crunched for time - the total body ones are close to an hour, and if you follow the schedule you can get from her site (or app), some days will be close to an hour as well with the workouts you are asked to combine. They are definitely worth it though, as I always feel like I got a great workout afterwards. Lindsay herself is a great instructor - she pushes you without leaving you feeling like she's criticizing you in any way, and I find her enjoyable to listen to.

If you already own the Pretty Fierce: Weight Loss set, the yoga disc is the exact same one that comes in that set. I will say I wish that this set had provided a different yoga workout, or that Lindsay would make a different (and longer!) yoga workout. But that's only because on days that call for yoga, I wish there was something more provided. I have a tendency to use different yoga workouts on those days, as while the yoga workout with this is a nice short and sweet one that's great for combining with another workout, it's not really enough all on it's own.

The only issue I had with this set is the same one several other reviewers have mentioned - the Lower Body Strength DVD in my set was defective. The audio was correct for the workout, but the video was of the Lower Body Endurance workout. It was an extremely easy fix though; I just contacted Moms into Fitness via their website and they sent me a new disc really quickly. So definitely check that disc first thing and see if yours needs replacing. I actually checked all of my discs at that point just to make sure there weren't any other issues, but the Lower Body Strength one was the only one.

I honestly cannot say enough good things about Lindsay and Moms into Fitness. I highly recommend this workout as well as many of her other ones!",1490227200,,3405,4.451923076923077
8555645,4,B00AP88IWY,"I think this is a great deal but after I ordered the set, I checked my DVDs and the lower body strength DVD is defective. Apparently by looking at the reviews on here, that has happened to a few people. So I contacted MIF directly and they sent me a replacement, they're great with customer service. I love that these DVDs are aimed at moms - my favorites are the pretty fierce sets and the 30 day core DVD from Lindsay Brin.",1476057600,,425,4.195121951219512
8555646,5,B00AP88IWY,"This workout is wildly effective. Very hard, particularly the longer workouts (the Total Body Endurance is the worst, particularly the very first time, but well worth it), but it's do-able and gives spectacular results. I have done many of Lindsay's workouts and I actually prefer this one to the other Pretty Fierce set. I had a baby 14 months ago and after doing Postnatal, Pretty Fierce Weight Loss, 30 Day Core, and Pretty Fierce Extreme Lean I have lost 45 pounds (5 pounds down from pre-baby weight and 5 above wedding weight!) and almost a size smaller than I was before I got pregnant and am also much stronger. Would highly recommend.

I did have an issue with one of the disks, so if you order from Amazon, I would suggest trying all the disks, particularly Lower Body Strength when you first receive the DVDs to make sure they all play okay. Moms into Fitness sent me a replacement disk, but I wish I would have realized and fixed it before I went to do that workout on my calendar.",1458000000,,993,4.516666666666667

I lost 40 lbs after 2 rounds of this program (I followed it and the nutrition guidelines diligently) and I also gained a ton a muscular strength. When it was time to switch to another program, I emailed Lindsay and she made her best suggestions to me of programs from other fitness experts that she likes. Those were good too, but not as comprehensive and effective as Fierce Lean Out! I can't find anything that equally compares to the Moms Into Fitness programs. If you want a program that is motivating and easy to stick to then this is it. It is a challenging program so be prepared to push yourself. Even my husband who serves in the military says it is one of the most challenging workouts he's done and that is saying a lot! He loves it and we do it together every night when the kids go to bed. After completing the program his scores on his PT test even improved to what he thought he was only capable of in his early twenties! This program is amazing and has proven to be that I don't have to pay for a gym membership to keep the body I want!",1456531200,6,1162,4.238738738738738
8555648,5,B00AP88IWY,"Update: I contacted the MIF company directly to tell them about my defective dvd and with no fuss they said simply they would send me a replacement which they did so that is awesome cutomer service and now I happily changed to 5 stars for my review!

I do not have time to go to the gym so I do this in the morning before my kids are up and it always kicks my butt even as I gain back strength and cardiovascular fitness after my second baby! I was obsessed with her Postnatal Slimdown dvd and this is a great continuation for anyone looking for harder and more advanced workouts. I love that most of them are about 30 mins so I can mix and match to get a solid 50-60mins workout. The Postnatal Slimdown never bored me over the 5 months that I used it basically non-stop, and I think this one will keep me motivated and entertained for a longtime as well. Even the strength videos are still good for breaking a sweat and getting my heart rate up. I do some running and Les Mills or bootcamp type stuff or spin when I can make it to the gym, and I think when I put 100% effort into these dvd's they are harder than any of my other physical activities.

I wish the yoga or yoga hybrid was a little longer (13 mins and 15 mins), or that she would do a dedicated yoga dvd :D.

My ""low"" rating is because I am really sad to report that my Lower Body Strength dvd is defective, it plays the video for Lower Body Endurance but the audio for Strength so it is obviously impossible to use it. I don't know if this has happened to anyone else, I contacted MIF I hope they will replace the defective dvd. I will update here when I get a response from them (in which case I would certainly give it a 5 start because I really love this).",1440115200,5,1724,4.094674556213017

8555650,5,B00AP88IWY,"Great routine for those tight on time.  My wife and I have done P90x (the exercises, screw the diet :) ) and find this to be just about as intense.  The exercises themselves aren't crazy but the pace is intense.  There are little mini breaks in most routines but the speed at which they knock out the reps is closer to cross-fit (which we refuse to do) then anything else.  I simply move at the pace I can to keep up and pause if they get too far ahead.

If you stick to the routine it's a nice change most days and not 60% abs like most workouts geared to women so I don't mind doing it with her.",1429401600,2,597,3.9831932773109244
8555651,3,B00AP88IWY,Good overall - some workouts are too long for me and not very challenging for me. I just prefer 30 minute or less workouts that are high intensity the entire time. She does a nice job!,1427500800,2,184,4.138888888888889
