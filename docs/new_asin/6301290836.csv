322927,4,6301290836,Classic movie. A movie about the struggles and phases of a great athlete and his love for the game and how his love interest deals with all that comes with it.

322933,5,6301290836,"A great story line and cast, it revolves around the rise and fall of a Football Player's long standing career, yet the love affair is at the heart of the story. I first saw this film in 1988 when it first hit theatres, and as someone who has loved a Football Player and seen/felt the trials and awards that go along with in the life of a player and his loved ones, it has been particularly compelling and heartfelt to view this movie over and over through out the years. That's why I added it to my collection. Fine performances too!",1401840000,,533,4.287128712871287
322934,5,6301290836,"If you are a fan of college football and especially the SEC, you need to own this movie.  Lots of stars and beautiful scenery.  I try to watch it every year the week before CFB starts Labor Day Weekend to get me ready.",1394236800,,218,4.046511627906977

322949,5,6301290836,"Solid football movie with a good look at life in the 1950's. Bogs down a bit toward the end, but very good performances by Dennis Quaid, Jessica Lange, and Timothy Hutton throughout. Not a John Goodman fan, but even he isn't too bad in this one.",1374710400,,245,4.3478260869565215
322950,5,6301290836,"I see this movie differently than some.  I see it as a study of how difficult a long marriage can be, especially as our personal health and fortunes change amid bewildering social change that leaves us behind.  Forty years down the road, we live with a different person in a different world that we never imagined as young people in love.

So if you hope to be together a long time, and to still love each other in the end, there better be shared basic values and consuming physical passion in the beginning to see you through.",1372550400,,527,4.412371134020619

He is one of my Favs. Timothy Hutton is very believable as Quaids brother. Lange is so sweet with her accent. I can watch this one over and over again. LOVE IT!!!",1369440000,3,300,4.280701754385965

322954,5,6301290836,"I first saw this movie nearly twenty years ago and it immediately became a favorite.  Since that first time I may have seen it another two times and was always compelled to watch it again, as if for the first time.  I came across the DVD and decided to purchase it.  While the packaging is not revolutionary, and the special features are quite standard (commentary by director Taylor Hackford and screenwriter Tom Rickman, additional scenes, and a making of featurette), the movie itself is still worth the price of admission.  Dennis Quaid, Jessica Lange, Timothy Hutton, and John Goodman are all excellent in their roles, and the underlying messages remain timeless and relevant.  As Roger Ebert (RIP) would say, ""It gets a a thumbs up"".",1366329600,,739,4.88
322955,5,6301290836,"This movie tracks a football star and beauty queens life.  The Pro-Football scenes are very realistic because they used real retired pro-football players. Unfortunately they were too realistic for Dennis Quaid who really broke his collar bone during the filming of this movie.  Not only that but after he broke his collarbone, the producers made him get up on top of other players and wave.  He really puts on a grin and you can not see the pain.  He is the true All-American.",1362268800,,476,4.698795180722891
322956,5,6301290836,"fantastic cameo, great plays by broncos player kirk dodge.  should be more movies like this. genuine smile and charisma brought to the screen",1354752000,,141,5.130434782608695
322957,5,6301290836,"Directed by Taylor Hackford, this exceptional 1988 drama not only deals with the vicissitudes of a 25-year marriage, but also the fleeting aspects of fame.

Taking place from the mid-1950s into the 1980s, the film casts Dennis Quaid as the All-American football player, turned pro, and Jessica Lange as the Magnolia Queen who gave up her career to become a wife and mother.

The dynamics of the marriage shift as Quaid's gridiron glories diminish and Jessica, now the mother of four, is forced to become the family's principal financial support.  Yet, through all their problems, the couple's love for each other endures.

Timothy Hutton is Quaid's nephew, who secretly loves his uncle's wife, John Goodman plays Dennis' best friend whose addiction to gambling almost causes the family's ruin and Carl Lumbly is an African-American friend of Quaid, the movie's symbol of the country's changing attitude toward civil rights during the 1960s.  Patricia Clarkson is also in the perfectly chosen cast.

This is a film that you will not soon forget.

322958,5,6301290836,"...That's the words that Dennis Quaid says in this 80's classic, to his wife Babs (Jessica Lange). This is a great story, not only of the life of an athlete, but of life itself. It encompasses an era between the 50s and the 80s, where this couple faces many life changing events. From the final game in college, getting drafted into the NFL, bankruptcy caused by their college friend, to a change of bread-winners after the retirement of the ""Gray Ghost"". After all they go through, they manage to stick together because they were truly in love.",1194739200,2,545,4.628865979381444
322959,4,6301290836,"Dennis Quaid plays a college football hero stuck in that role and incapable of doing anything else. Jessica Lange is the college queen who marries him, has lots of babies, and gets neglected by Quaid. Quaid goes on to the pros, passing by business opportunities along the way, and stays on too long (it's all he knows). When they are about to go bankrupt, Lange takes charge, getting a job and holding them together. More important, she grows as a person, taking on responsibilities and doing things she never thought she could do. Meanwhile, Quaid continues to live in the past. Then the best 20 minutes of the movie occurs: Quaid and Lange confront their dilemma and work it out. Whether their (and the movie's) solution is believable is questionable, but the acting here is very sharp.",1122422400,6,788,4.759124087591241
322960,4,6301290836,"""Everybody's All American"" is the story of Gavin Grey(Dennis Quaid)a guy who goes from stud-muffin to couch potato faster than you can say touchdown. In this endevor he's aided by Jessica Lange - the no-good-for-him love of his life. Taylor Hackford directs with slick style and lots of heart this story better suited for reruns of ""General Hospital"" than a big screen romance. Nevertheless, and happily so, the film works on all levels.
TRANSFER: Very respectable effort from Warner Brothers with rich, vibrant colors, deep blacks and some nicely balanced colors and contrast levels. On the down side, some scenes appear to have a slightly hazy look to them and there is considerable film grain in a few scenes and age related artifacts to contend with. Overall, however, an adequate remastering effort.
EXTRAS: The director gives us his personal insight into the making of this film which isn't really as insightful as one might imagine. There's also a trailer.
BOTTOM LINE: If you like schmaltz with your beer then this one has it all. If the only thing that excites you is touchdowns then Monday Night Football is a better fit.",1075248000,7,1131,4.9267015706806285
322961,4,6301290836,"This movie's message is, simply put, don't go living in the past or the present may very well run over you like a very large lineman.  Initially, it would appear that the movie glamourizes those bright college days, full of football heroism & social ascendancy on campus, but it becomes apparent soon enough that the film's main characters are real losers in the larger game of life.  Jessica Lange in particular plays a southern belle who, as her life progresses, realizes that life really isn't a Homecoming dance, and that the culture that once put her on a pedastel has, in the long run, really screwed her over by limiting her options.  Ahh, the life of the trophy wife.  Meanwhile, Dennis Quaid (whose smart-alecky persona normally drives me crazy) comes across as a total loser in the bigger picture, as he remains mired in the increasingly long-ago glory days of his youth, unable to cope with his present-day, beer-gut-ridden life of mediocrity.  Ahh, the life of a has-been athlete.
Meanwhile, the characters that remained on the fringes in the good old days focused on what they might do in the future rather than dwelling in the past, and had much more meaningful lives as a result.  This is all very gratifying for people who weren't high school football heroes or prom queens.  While not a great film, this is a pretty good film, and a worthy antidote for excessive exposure to rampant nostalgia.",1073865600,7,1410,4.777777777777778
322962,5,6301290836,"This is an overlooked film from 1988, and perhaps the best performance in Quaid's career.  Director Taylor Hackford has had an uneven career, but this stands as one of his best movies so far.  Quaid is the a star college football player who marries the homecoming queen (Jessica Lange) and SLOWLY comes to realize that the fame and glory of his college days won't carry him in the real world of professional football and the years after.  Lange gets top billing (contractually), but it is Quaid's movie.  This should have been his Oscar-nominated performance.
Hackford (or careful editing) pulls back before certain moments fall into sappy sentimentality.  But the period detail is meticulous and perfect, and certain pressings of this video come with the dialog-only (no music) trailer for 1989's ""Batman"", one of the unintentionally best movie trailers ever.",1004313600,22,860,5.158273381294964
322963,4,6301290836,"I loved this movie.  I'm not a big football fan, but there was enough sports and enough romance to keep both me and my husband entertained throughout the movie.
It's a peek into into the turbulent and chaotic life of a diehard, aging football hero who never let's the team down, and his beautiful, naive, trophy wife.
Throughout the entire movie, you are routing for both the team and the marriage.  When you think that love has lost, it's just begininng.
If anyone knows who sings the ending song, I think it's called, ""It's Forever"", please email me with the artist's name.
Thanks-",995932800,12,583,4.650485436893204
322964,3,6301290836,"i remember working as a extra on the set of this movie when they were filming in baton rouge thirteen years ago.its been three years since i've left, and if i went back today, it would still be the same. Baton Rouge is a football mad town. it practically rivals Alabama of the importance the sport has on its people and when i was at LSU, i got caught up in the fever, going to most of the home games... And yes, The Golden Band Of Tigerland is good, but not as good as Southern University's The Human Jukebox.  Dennis Quade has never been accused of being a great actor, and his performance here is ok. at times he seems more of a caricature, which is what is his character Gavin Grey is: the dumb jock who lives for football, but can't live without it off the field. Jessica Lange is a good actress, but she basically plays a trophy wife. when asked what she's majoring in college, her reply: "" Gavin and me."" Timothy Hutton's character was one of the few bright spots in the flim, so was Carl Lumbly's role as the black civil rights leader/entrepenuer who has higher goals in mind. John Goodman should stick to doing Television. he's at best a character actor. Watch this movie for the shots of Tiger Stadium and the glory that is southern football. That's all there is to this film. But down there, that's all they care about anyway",973900800,3,1336,4.365461847389558
322965,5,6301290836,"Great flick with QUAID,GOODMAN,HUTTON,AND THE LOVELY JESSICA LANGE.
