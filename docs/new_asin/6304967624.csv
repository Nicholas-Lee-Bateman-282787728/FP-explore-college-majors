7880143,4,6304967624,"I was looking for the SILENT SERVICE series that appeared on TV back in the late fifty's, I beleive, where each week they would feature one or two subs that were in action in World War II.This featured some of those subs and some historical facts about submarines.
All things considered, this two disc set is pretty good.

I would like to know where I can find the entire TV series ?",1245456000,5,383,4.319444444444445
7880144,4,6304967624,"In light of recent events (considering where I live), Silent Service is a perfect foil to the Japanese ""Pacifistic"" Self Defense Forces (JSDF) against the ""Warring"" US Military.
We start with a Russian Sub ""supposedly"" attacking and destroying a JNSDF Diesel Sub, killing the Crew.
Later on, the Captain (and close friend of the slain Captain) of another Diesel Sub figures out that things aren't what they supposed to be.
When he tries tor eveal this info, he finds out that there is more to the picture than meets the Eye.
This then runs into a debate of sorts on US-Japanese Relations, and the way two different Armies (The JSDF and it's ""repressed"" role vs. the US Military Might) duke it out, all the while the political upheaval strains Japanese relations (not to mention the obvious Hatred of some Us Folk to the Japanese, when ""talks"" are held by the Us at a place that would be considered ""intimidating""...Pearl Harbor).
While not Tom Clancy fare, it still provides a graphic, yet very powerful message. You just have to watch it and see.",996883200,,1047,4.758241758241758
7880145,5,6304967624,"When the manga this film was based on was released in Japan, it was very controversial, and it is easy to see why.  It explores some of the hidden conflicts in modern Japanese politics, and is unabashedly anti-American.  If you like politics and action that depends on intelligence and insight, you will love this film.",974764800,,319,4.781818181818182
