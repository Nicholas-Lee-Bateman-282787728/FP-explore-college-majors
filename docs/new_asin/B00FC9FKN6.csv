5975163,5,B00FC9FKN6,"I enjoy movies about Cuba. Havana 57 starts out as a simple murder mystery and expands into an investigation of corrupt cops, corrupt police officials, corrupt government officials, the American mob and students that want an honest Cuban government. This is a small but very entertaining movie with a cast of unknowns. I highly recommend this one.",1428537600,,347,5.105263157894737
5975164,4,B00FC9FKN6,"I Liked this movie...the settings are beautiful and you really get a tastes of what Cuba was like back then. The script was poorly written and the director had obviously not worked in a long time, nevertheless, the actors were still able to pull it off.",1414886400,2,253,4.521739130434782

5975166,4,B00FC9FKN6,"For the first time in 55 years, a movie set in Havana, Cuba that was actually shot in Havana, Cuba.
It's a small independent film that doesn't try to reinvent the wheel but the cars, music, and the real Rivera Hotel,
makes it a good watch. Many recognizable faces but no big stars, apart from that it was a pleasant 95 minutes spent.",1393891200,2,333,4.301587301587301
5975167,1,B00FC9FKN6,Ugh!  Poorly written drech.  The poor actors come off wooden. It gets one star for filming in Cuba. Utter drech.,1389052800,,112,4.55
5975168,5,B00FC9FKN6,"I was in Cuba in 1958 - Batista was still in power. This movie took me back as a kid. It was very credible, and well acted. The plot was not novel..but the theme was probably typical of the real life of Havana in 57. I am not sure how much it has changed since then. Would love to go back to Havana but currently is exploitative in costly.",1475107200,3,339,3.927536231884058

5975180,4,B00FC9FKN6,"Very cool movie!  Good characters, great story, awesome cars and while I thought the main character - the good cop, in a world of corruption was not gonna cut it, he really surprised me at the end.

5975211,2,B00FC9FKN6,"Poorly written, poor acting and directing.  Havana is tired and poverty stricken,too drab for 1957 Havana, so the scenery doesn't help.  This would have looked better at least if it had been filmed somewhere else.",1452384000,,213,5.057142857142857

Plus there were some really obvious period correct mistakes as it was supposed to be 1957...they did not have thin white wall tires then.

""Havana 57"" :
As usual a Movie made in Castro Cuba,the usual propaganda,made by accomplices in the misery the regime has done in this case as usual foreigners who for some reason are under the spell of a ruined Country like Cuba and who of course rely on sources still in CastroCuba run by Castro goons. The movie is boring despite the name-calling of famous clubs the premise is the usual as in most so-called ""histories"" in books on Cuba and on film. While I am far from sympathetic to the Crook Batista,the fact remains that Cuba Pre-Castro was not only prospering but did better than the States(we didn't have segregation). The movie has errors such as the vehicles,the accessories for the vehicles and plain lazy when passing the malecon you see modern-day tourists in shorts and not 1957 Attire. The movie is slow,awful and typical of modern day Castro Cuba Apologists. You want to see a better movie see Lost City.",1497744000,,959,4.680473372781065
