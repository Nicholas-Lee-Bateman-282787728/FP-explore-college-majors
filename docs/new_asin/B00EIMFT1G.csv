5916622,5,B00EIMFT1G,I just recieved mine and did the first workout. It 2 workouts total 55 minuite including warm up and cool down. The workouts are about 25 minutes long. Each moves is 45 seconds long and very  tough and effective workout and i also love the music. The first workout requires no weight but you will need a yoga mat. The second workout requires one dumbbell. I highly recommend this ab workout to add to her other workouts.,1376524800,18,420,4.454545454545454

5916625,5,B00EIMFT1G,This is a very hard workout.  Zuzka goes through how to do the exercise and then does it with you.,1413331200,,98,3.9

5916628,5,B00EIMFT1G,AWESOME workout!  She looks great on the cover of her DVDs and I can see why!  The workouts are short but intense.  Love it!,1407888000,,124,4.083333333333333
5916629,5,B00EIMFT1G,"Even thought is shorter than the strength and cardio series it's still good and it's worth it.
You won't regret the 13 dollars...",1404086400,,129,4.6521739130434785
5916630,5,B00EIMFT1G,"This workout, as well as any other Zuzka workouts, will for sure get your heart rate up and leave you feeling like you accomplished something. There is no dilly dallying in any of her workouts, but pure hard work that leaves you exhausted. For the intermediate to advanced exerciser.",1401494400,2,283,4.795918367346939
5916631,5,B00EIMFT1G,"Zuzka has the right idea when it comes to working out...I can not wait to get well enough to start doing these workouts again! I used them in the past and then got sick and have not bee able to do them...I have been following her since she started out posting workout DVDs on Youtube and started the whole Bodyroc.tv workouts. She definitely knows how to get a good workout in and your don't have to buy fancy equippment or anything like that...you can do these workouts with just your body weight to start out and work your way up! :) These are great for those who want a great intense workout but do not have hours to spend in the gym. I know I do not like spending that much time in the gym or working out at home and even though I am a homemaker, with my health and spceaility diet (I'm always cooking), these work outs are great and you get real, immediate results!",1396310400,,870,4.2155688622754495
5916632,5,B00EIMFT1G,These are not your ordinary ab workout. Zuzka does every routine with you; so while you're sweating & hurting so is she. There's no music unlike my other workout DVDs. This allows me to focus on my muscles & the routine. Zuzka doesn't do a lot of explanation while doing the exercise which I love because I just want to focus & not listen to same jibber jabber over & over. I totally recommend this DVD workout. I want more of her workouts. Nice job Zuzka!,1395187200,,456,4.313953488372093
5916633,5,B00EIMFT1G,"Fantastic workout at a great price I have tried and still use p90x, turbo fire, insanity, etc. And these are cheaper and just as good if not better than the others.",1394928000,,164,4.32258064516129
5916634,5,B00EIMFT1G,I love all her DVDs! I have long work hours & this is the only HIT workout that gets results fast.,1393027200,,98,3.7142857142857144
5916635,5,B00EIMFT1G,"This dvd has two fun and intense workouts similar to her zcut cardio and power series. I wish the exercises were reviewed prior to the workout or at least listed so I could write them on my dry erase board first. I like her dvds because you can go at your own pace. I like to compete against Zuzka and always aim to beat her reps while maintaining good form as she is good about reminding the viewers to do. Highly recommend this for all body types and perfect to mix with her jump rope dvd, zcut, and web zgym.",1392940800,,511,4.12
5916636,5,B00EIMFT1G,Arrived alot sooner than expected....  Great service and easy to use.  Well done my friends. I look forward to more Zuzka Light videos.,1391731200,,135,4.826086956521739
5916637,3,B00EIMFT1G,"Although I liked the fast moving pace of the workout, I expected it to be more challenging...
I use the workout along with my daily core routine",1389571200,,144,4.37037037037037
5916638,5,B00EIMFT1G,"I bought Zuzka Zcut Six-Pack Power Abs with Zcut Power Cardio.  Previously, I had done Insanity, Cathe Freidrich, The Pitt, Get Ripped in 90 Days, Rushfit,  After two weeks training with these exercise programs I have to say that Zuzka is the best.  The workouts are simple , but very intense and effective.  Zuzka explain so clearly each exercise and she is a great motivator.  In addition, the price is incredible, and the deliver is excellent, I received the product in few days.  I like to train minimum one hour by day, so I do a routine of Zzka Cardio with another of Zcut Six Pack.  In a couple of days I'm buying Zcut Power Strength in order to include it with the others daily routines.  You won't regret buying this product.",1389484800,2,734,4.507575757575758
5916639,5,B00EIMFT1G,"First off, I want to say that over the years I've bought probably 7 out of 10 Ab DVD's that have been released.  Abs have always been the most important part of my workout, and I have always wanted to be ""up"" on the latest and greatest workouts.  With that being said, I have found in the past that some DVD's moved way too fast- risking injury, or they were too slow and/or easy.  This DVD is perfect.  The exercises chosen are cutting edge (i.e., Planks) and the pace is excellent- not slow, yet not so fast that you want to give up.  This was my first purchase of a Zuzka DVD, and I am not disappointed.  There are two workouts: The first you have an outstanding AB workout without anything additional- just you and a mat.  The second is an advanced workout in which a dumbbell is used for added resistance.  That workout is fantastic as well. I can see why this woman has such a large following- her workouts are outstanding- they are on par with ANY well known trainer out there.  The DVD is tough, thorough, effective, and challenging- you will see results.",1388620800,12,1063,4.38265306122449
5916640,3,B00EIMFT1G,"the nicest thing I can say is the price is right,  she looks great, and her moves are solid.
If you could do this workout you would get in great shape.
BUT this is a bare bones workout video.
It is ok if you don't mind working out with a nice looking person, who is demonstrating hard moves in an empty room, with no music, funny quips, personal energy or class energy.
Personally I like a workout in a group setting, with nice background music, good choreography, and a nice mix of cast members.",1388188800,3,496,4.276595744680851
5916641,5,B00EIMFT1G,"I absolutely love Zuzka.  Her workouts are challenging and so effective.  I particularly like the second workout done with a weight.  The first workout is also great, but I have yet to perfect (do) the clapping pushup, still doing that off my knees.  I've been working out religiously for several years now, and Zuzka is giving my the results I always wanted.  You can't go wrong with this workout.",1386806400,2,398,4.7101449275362315
5916642,5,B00EIMFT1G,A great workout video that focuses on different parts of the body that I didn't know muscles even existed. I would definitely recommend this one to others.,1386288000,,155,4.777777777777778
5916643,5,B00EIMFT1G,"i purchased all of zuzana's dvds and jump rope as well being a member of her zgym and its was the very best thing ever!!! all of her workouts are intense and challenging but you are certain that even if you cant keep up with her in the beginning, you know that you will get there! and for those who are extremely strong its a never ending challenge to beat your best! i could care less if the dvds came in bubble wrap it is the best purchase i have ever made!  her take on yoga is something unique and exciting as well! congrats to finally finding a workout that has it all! :)",1385424000,,577,4.06140350877193
5916644,4,B00EIMFT1G,"I have been a fan of Zuzka since she was with BodyRock. This ab workout is very tough but I love it.  The exercises never leave you bored, and the results are amazing. I do agree with one of the other reviews that this is not the best for beginners. However, as with all Zuzka videos, you try your best and work up.  I was only able to complete one half of the ab video for a while and am still working up to finishing an entire ab workout.  In time...

Update 1/10/2014:
I am able to do both workouts completely.  Woo hoo.  Unfortunately, I started having wrist problems, presumably from the plyo pushups she does in workout #1.  I am still doing the workouts (and love them) but the wrist pain is preventing me from doing any plank exercises that involve my hands :(.  I still love it but am recovering. Be cautious.",1385078400,4,818,4.266233766233766
5916645,5,B00EIMFT1G,Bought for Wife. She loves the workouts. very challenging. and she has been following Zuzka for about 6 months. Does not come in a DVD case though. its only a cardboard sleeve.,1384214400,,176,4.53125
5916646,5,B00EIMFT1G,This is a KILLER dvd for your abs! The workouts go beyond that to help sculpt your whole body while putting the emphasis on your abs. Really worked up a sweat through both of these and recommend this for anyone trying to get that boost in their current workout routine!,1383091200,,269,4.4
5916647,5,B00EIMFT1G,"Zuzana (Zuzka) is my favorite trainer.  I subscribe to her ZGym and she consistently puts out fun, interesting, challenging workouts.  I also love her DVDs and this one has two ab workouts that also incorporate cardio within the ab workout.  I recommend all her products.  she has really helped me to gain so much muscle and strength.",1381190400,2,334,4.807017543859649
5916648,5,B00EIMFT1G,"Loved this DVD, I can literally feel the six-pack after one workout (2 total; about 30mins. each). I'm already pretty toned and whatnot, I don't have a ""belly"". You can go ahead and do 1000 crunches and eat like crap - you won't get the results you want. It's a two part process, as I'm sure you've heard before that abs are made in the kitchen. Diet + Exercise + CONSISTENCY = results
Aside from that, Zuzka did a great job sculpting the abs from different angles. Someone mentioned it had too much cardio? I didn't think so. Besides, that's Zuzka. She's a Get-It-Done kind of girl. I like the way she switches it up. Did you really think she would do an Ab video just lying on the ground?

Point is: you WILL feel the burn and you WILL feel sexy. Get it. Don't even waste your time thinking about it. It's worth it!",1381017600,8,817,4.2709677419354835
5916649,1,B00EIMFT1G,"Love Zuzka but disappointed that she didn't provide any modifications.  I've had two c-sections in the past two years and wanted something that would get my abs back into shape.....couldn't even do one sit up with these series.  For now, this DVD will just sit on a shelve but hopefully I'll use it later once I'm a bit stronger.",1380758400,,329,4.559322033898305
5916650,5,B00EIMFT1G,"This workout DVD is nicely done! The set is clean, white with a dash a black, meaning there's nothing to distract you. You will be sore, even if you half-do it. My fitness level did not allow for me to do 100% of the exercises, but I can appreciate it, fully. I think it's advanced/high intermediate, but a job well done!",1379980800,3,321,4.278688524590164
5916651,5,B00EIMFT1G,"This is the 3rd Zuzka DVD I've tried.  I did workout 1 today, and worked up a big sweat-and I'm in shape!  2 of the exercises were almost too hard for me, but I know I'll get better as I do it more.  Watch It Now Entertainment offers EXCELLENT customer service.  When I ordered, they accidentally sent another DVD that I already had.  I contacted the company, and they immediately responded.  Said the mix up was due to computer glitch around the time of my order. Told me to keep what they sent (shared it with a friend) and they immediately mailed the correct item which arrived quickly.  Love ALL the Zuzka DVDs and great customer service from Watch It Now.  Highly recommend!",1379721600,6,679,4.463414634146342
5916652,5,B00EIMFT1G,"Great workouts from Zuzka, they get your heart rate up and really work your core.  Great add on workouts for strength training.",1379289600,4,127,4.7727272727272725
5916653,5,B00EIMFT1G,"I had to review because Zuzka is awesome!!! I read all the rave reviews and I couldn't agree more. I have all her DVDs and I subscribe to her YouTube Channel. She has a rockin body and a sweet personality. My workout collection includes Jillian Michaels, Jackie Warner, Brook Burke, Shawn T and Tony Horton, but Zuska is my favorite by far! Plus she goes hard but also gets tired like you. Plus the DVDs are a great price and ""Watch It Now Entertainment"" has great service and super fast shipping.

This is one of my favorite ab workouts and my favorite Zuzka workout DVD. I love the 2nd workout with the weights. I either try to do back to back workouts or I do one of these workouts after I do one of the Power Strenght or Power Cardio DVD.",1379203200,16,742,4.26241134751773
5916654,5,B00EIMFT1G,"Love this Power Abs DVD! I have been using it for the past few weeks and I am finally seeing results! I can actually see defined abs and I am so excited! Thank you, Thank you, Thank you Zuzka! :)",1379116800,7,195,3.9
5916655,5,B00EIMFT1G,"The workouts in this DVD are brutal for your core.  Workout number 1 consists of 2 different circuits of Tabata training 45 sec. on 15 sec. off for two rounds each circuit for a total time of 24 minutes.  Workout number 2 you use a dumbell (if you don't have one it's ok) there are no breaks in between excercises, you move from one excercise to the next and again there are 2 circuits that you go thru twice for a total of 24 minutes.  It has a warm up and a cool down.

I really like these routines, you're not just lying doing crunches Z really spices it up like she only knows how.",1378771200,17,585,4.060869565217391
5916656,5,B00EIMFT1G,Zuzka did it again!  These routines are effective and too the point!  Routine one is abs with cardio which is not too extreme.  The second routine utilizes a dumbbell.  I love that her DVDs are not so expensive.,1378598400,,211,4.473684210526316
5916657,5,B00EIMFT1G,Another great workout dvd.  She always has something new and challenging to offer.  This is a terrific ab focused workout.  It's not all crunches and sit ups.  It's for your total core.  You can't spot reduce and this is a perfert workout dvd for really toning your core.  Cardio is very necessary for tight abs and your diet plays a major role too.  I love the fast pace and her motivating personality!!  I am looking forward to her next dvds!!,1377820800,2,445,4.475
5916658,5,B00EIMFT1G,I love all of Zuzka's DVD's but this one is my favorite.  My abs is the area where I need the most work on after having 3 kids.  This DVD have everything I want in a workout.  Not only do you get your heart rate up but you work your abs too .  I was dripping in sweat and my abs where shaking after the workout (The two things I look for in a workout).  I love how it whips my butt in such a short time.  I was completely wiped out.  I've collected many abs workout dvds in the past but this one I will do over and over again.  It gets the job done!,1377129600,13,549,3.6724137931034484
5916659,5,B00EIMFT1G,This is a great workout! I am excited to finally get great abs. Awesome service got it in 2 days!,1377129600,2,97,3.9
5916660,5,B00EIMFT1G,"I love this Power Abs work out! It focuses on our core and as you know you have to work your whole core to come close to a 6 pack! I hear too many people complain that they do not get the results they want when they do abs, but when you ask do you include back as well? The back is part of our core and if you do not work your back you will never get rid of your ""love handles"" and I still hear people say you get get rid of it by doing side planks, well yes, but you still have to work your back as well. I felt she covered the full core area that targets front and back of the core.
Thanks and now just ordered the Zropes as well as her newest dvd :D",1376956800,3,652,3.631205673758865
5916661,1,B00EIMFT1G,"I was excited about this but it was a disappointment.  I wished she had focused on abs only instead of mixing it with cardio. We all know you need cardio and eating right to lose fat so the abs can be seen, blah blah...
Don't buy it if you're looking for ab routines. I was looking for something to add to her other workouts. That's her style so I shouldn't have been too surprised. She looks good tho. Great make up job :)",1376784000,9,423,4.096385542168675
5916662,5,B00EIMFT1G,"I am a huge fan of Zuzka. Have all of her dvds, and follow her site. This is a great combination  of moves, and is a great set of workouts. Now, here's the problem. The quality of my dvd is HORRIBLE!! It skips, freezes, you name it. I am going to order another one right now, and then send this one back. I am very disappointed about this. I hate getting faulty products. There is no excuse for it in my book! Due to the low cost of Z's dvds, I will pay to ship another one. Product control, wake up!!",1376611200,4,501,3.9603960396039604
