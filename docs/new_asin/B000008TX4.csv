7905320,3,B000008TX4,"We have thoroughly enjoyed the ""Peter Rabbit Collection"" by Goodtimes Video -- at least up to this point.

The stories of Peter and Benjamin, Mrs. Tiggle-winkle and Mr. Fisher, and the Flopsy Bunnies were all 5+ stars in our estimation.  However, we cannot 'get into' this video.

The pacing in the Jemima story is too slow, and the story of her inability to hatch eggs too sad; while the tale of Tom Kitten and his siblings is just not all that interesting.

Three stars.  The production quality is still excellent, it is just that the stories are not as interesting.",1119225600,,568,4.64
7905321,5,B000008TX4,"We have enjoyed all of the Beatrix Potter video series.  The only drawback we have had, is that I found out the hard way that the tapes are not write-protected (actually my 3-year old found out.)  So if you order any of these wonderful titles (Tom Kitten, Flopsy Bunnies, Peter Rabbit, Two Bad Mice, or Mr. Tod) be sure to remove the write-protect tab.",1008288000,9,352,4.484375
