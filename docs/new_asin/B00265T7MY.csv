There were some highlights such as the 1913 Edison attempt at sound and film.  The extras were amazing.  There was a very long sequence from about 1926 of an engineer (I think) taking an audience through the vitaphone process including brief clips of a film set, camera, sound recording and reproduction system.  If you are interested in the evolution of the musical this will be a very interesting DVD.",1375315200,,526,4.725274725274725
8352036,5,B00265T7MY,The title of my review says it all I love this series and I am glad that they created this DVD and the one for 2000's to complete the set,1254614400,4,137,3.6
8352037,2,B00265T7MY,"The producers of this DVD did not have much of a budget for clips, which sort of hampers one when one is creating a documentary about vintage films. There are a few brief clips, apparently licensed from Turner, of 1929-vintage films that have been issued on LD or DVD, but other films from the era are represented by clips from their public-domain trailers! As for ""performances by Sophie Tucker, Al Jolson.."", yes, you will see performances... FROM NEWSREELS! Also in the public domain. I think you get the picture. This is a low-budget effort that will disappoint most film buffs.",1251158400,19,582,4.83
