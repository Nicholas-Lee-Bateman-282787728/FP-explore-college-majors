I am sad that Marie Dupret needs a heart transplant, also I am glad Peter Hallam has fire Mrs. Haun she was not a housekeeper in the movie. Raquel was the housekeeper and she resepcts every one including Melanie and her twin daughters who she looks up to and like a mother figure to them. I can't believe Mark and Val had sex if they knew they were going to be a family and also went to an abortion clinic to get an abortion with an unexperienced doctor who does not know what he or she is doing. I am glad Pam has given Melanie a chance and Melanie given birth to twins again and moved into a huge house.",1352332800,3,804,4.0

1178325,1,B0000039D7,"I just watched this movie last night and thoroughly enjoyed it. That being said, My review is based on the menu & pause play shortcomings.

I paused the movie for ten minutes and came back. When I tried to resume play nothing happened (I should be able to pause a DVD and resume play without any trouble). I had to eject the disk and restart the movie. That is when I discovered THIS DVD DOESN'T HAVE SCENE SELECTION! The only option is to play the movie (from the beginning) and skip chapters to find where you left off. I can't believe anyone would produce a DVD without scene/chapter selections. Even the cheapest DVD's have them. If this very basic feature is important to you, I would wait until this DVD is rereleased with a proper menu.",1257206400,3,743,4.463235294117647
1178326,5,B0000039D7,The quick delivery of the DVD was excellent. Also the quality of the DVD is great and you enjoy whatching it. The sounds and theme song is very familiy like and there is so much to learn for a teenager about change,1212364800,,214,4.119047619047619

1178329,4,B0000039D7,"If you have read Danielle Steel's books, you will recognise the style which is perfectly translated onto the screen - Michael Nouri and Cheryl Ladd are well cast together in this film about the trials and tribulations of merging two existing families into one, whilst also merging two people in love, but with demanding careers.  The film is well crafted, and if you have not seen any of the other films of DS books, will definitely leave you wanting to see the others as well.",1162512000,3,477,4.6117647058823525
1178330,4,B0000039D7,I'm not a Danielle Steel fan i would rather watch some of the book's turn TV movies ....CHANGES was a good movie i was hook on it its like the brady bunch 20 yrs later in a way with a little more romance..the ending was just sweet for me i'm a sucker for romantic endings....,1149984000,2,275,4.0181818181818185
1178331,3,B0000039D7,"I caught this movie on the WE channel at midnight.  It was a tear-jerking and at times annoying movie. I didn't care so much for the quick resolution of everyone making up, however, the twins at the end was an interesting touch. Typical Danielle Steel based movie.
