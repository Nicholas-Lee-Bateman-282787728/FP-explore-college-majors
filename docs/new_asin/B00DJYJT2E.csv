5820073,2,B00DJYJT2E,"""I can track cougars, I can track bear and I can track you."" Jack (Fraser) is a full time activist and part time father. While trying to save a forest from being cut down he gets into a fight and someone ends up dead. When Jack's kids, out for a camping trip, witness a murder the killers begin to stalk them in order to keep them from talking. When Jack hears about this he plans to save them, after breaking out of prison. I know what your thinking. That really sounds exciting and should be fun to watch. I thought the same thing. Then I started to watch it. This is one of the least exciting ""chase"" movies I have ever seen. It could have been because of what I expected but I found it hard to stay interested in this for the whole movie. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, it's just not what I was hoping for. Overall, yet another movie where the plot and idea are way better then the actual movie was. I give it a C.",1378425600,9,920,4.06043956043956

5820131,3,B00DJYJT2E,Just ok,1406419200,,7,3.0
5820132,5,B00DJYJT2E,It was a movie that surprised me with Brendan Fraser playing that role.  He was awesome and a natural.  I would watch again.,1396396800,,124,4.3478260869565215

5820164,1,B00DJYJT2E,"My mom got this movie and ""surprised"" us with this turkey. What a lovely, lovely surprise ... Brendan Fraser, why?",1391644800,,114,4.75
5820165,1,B00DJYJT2E,"I don't know where to start. The bad guy does needless killing, and even the ""nice"" bad guy kills. Bad guy shots from close up and misses, and Hero keeps wasting ammo shooting from long distances with a sawed off shotgun without aiming. During chase scene 20 the hero has a long fight with the good bad while his daughter is screaming don't hurt him. Minutes later the hero swims over to the bad guy and fights again. This time and he stabs the bad guy in the stomach, but like all movies the hero does not ""neutralize the bad guy. So the bad guy come to with only a cut on 3 fingers. Then chase number 30 starts. The hero is shoot close up, then come back to life from off screen, and is able to fight. Here comes the really bad part.  Since the film was running out of money, the bad guy finally dies accidentally killing his good bad guy brother during the struggle from another rifle shot, some how while rolling on the ground.  Conclusion. The good guy who had escaped from prison, kills 2 bad guys, and the film immediately fades after that fight to black while his lawyer wife start talking to the dark screen, apparently some days or weeks later ""I want to thank you for dismissing ALL of the charges and letting my husband out of jail. Short titles continue, and since it is a budget movie it ends during the 15 seconds!  This flick is DUMP, STUPID, SIMPLISTIC and even worse than my rambling review. DO NOT BUY or WATCH THIS MOVIE!  This maybe the worse review I ever wrote, but it goes with one of the worse movies I have ever seen.",1391472000,2,1543,4.273972602739726

5820167,1,B00DJYJT2E,"Must be one of the laziest, worst films I've seen. The plot is so full of holes it's terrible. The acting is wooden apart from Dominic Purcell, and he struggles. Lost for words really.",1386979200,,184,4.4411764705882355

5820169,1,B00DJYJT2E,"What a boring, poorly acted, terribly filmed and edited piece of garbage. Fraser should stick with his well-wrapped mummies and read scripts before committing to such wastes of time...",1385251200,,184,5.379310344827586
5820170,3,B00DJYJT2E,Low budget okay movie. They should have spent more time on script. I'll neither recommend it or not. It's your call.,1384300800,,116,4.571428571428571

5820213,2,B00DJYJT2E,It was like a really low budget film.  Didn't like it.  I was looking for something better due to Brendan Fraser playing in it.,1382140800,,127,4.25

5820215,1,B00DJYJT2E,"This storyline has more holes than swiss cheese. Brandon Frasier is a terrific and fun actor, but even he could not get his claws around this to save it.",1381449600,,153,4.310344827586207

5820217,1,B00DJYJT2E,Fraser (producer/star) couldn't wait 5 minutes to heap on the propaganda.  Usually they try and lure you in with a plot.  This could go over as a 3 part MSLSD (MSNBC) mini series at best.  What happened to Mr. Mummy?  He became a drone.,1381017600,,236,4.295454545454546
5820218,1,B00DJYJT2E,"Who do I see about getting a refund on this STINKER? If it were possible to give half a star I certainly would.
Brendon Fraser must have lost a bet. He should know better.",1380931200,2,171,4.0588235294117645

5820221,1,B00DJYJT2E,"I am a huge Brendon Fraser fan and that is the best thing I can say about this movie.  Don't waste your money.  If you have to watch, wait until it is on Prime for free.  The acting was bad, the story was delivered poorly, a first year drama student could have done a better job directing.  Horrible movie from start to finish.",1379808000,8,327,4.142857142857143
5820222,2,B00DJYJT2E,"Jack (Brendan Fraser) is a tree hugger who gets himself landed in jail. He composes sappy letters to his daughter which are read to us in a low caveman voice. While Jack is in jail, his family (minus his separated wife/lawyer Lara Daans) are out camping when they run into a Steinbeck novel and become hunted. The film creates characters, but there is no connection to the viewer. The action isn't anything to get excited over. The main interest of the film becomes Kenny (Ethan Suplee). Kenny was in a truck accident and has some mental issues. He believes Jack's wife, who he talks to by cell phone, is his own mother. Apparently Canadian films has solved the problem of cell phone reception in remote areas.

The cat and mouse chase in the woods seemed secondary to the film which was pushing the theme of Jack reconciling his actions with his daughter. It didn't mesh as well as it could. Makes for a desperation rental.

8593945,2,B00DJYJT2E,"It could have been better of course , plot terrible a little bit of suspense  that is all ...it kind went too fast for me ... one thing that throw me off and did not make sense to me  is how come a prisoner can be out of the prison as fugitive just to save his daughter & son ... also he had a chance to kill the bad guy with his own riffle but instead he ran away to look for their son & daugter instead of killing him.. Dumb act from Fraser ... I give 2 stars just because had a little bit of suspense this is why ...",1479168000,,519,3.6666666666666665

8593949,3,B00DJYJT2E,It wasn't a bad movie by any means it just seemed a little too unrealistic at a few points and lacked a little creativity.,1461024000,,122,4.125
