7132634,1,B00WICR2O0,"I am writing this review for my children. After watching many seasons and buying boxed sets for my son and daughter, who are both big fans of Pokemon, they have been disappointed in this past two seasons. My daughter has pointed out that some of the episodes have a similar theme that has been on some of the earlier seasons, ie, Meowth and Bonnie being tied together was very close to an earlier season episode where Meowth and Pikachu were tied together. They enjoyed the Black and White seasons better because there was less of Team Rocket in it. My son feels that they have really over used the Team Rocket spin. Both have said that Serena is a whinny little brat who lacks the fire of some of the other girl characters that Ash has traveled with in other seasons. I have watched many of the past seasons with my children and agree with a lot of what they have to say. Bonnie is demanding, Clemont is a wimp, and Serena is whinny. Plus, how many times can someone watch Team Rocket stalk children?",1464998400,,1001,4.416216216216216

7132647,5,B00WICR2O0,"Rating is for the Pokmon XY series over all, my favorite since Diamond & Pearl and an even better English dub, and I'm so glad to know that the second season (18th overall) is coming out on DVD. Cartoon Network has since buried the Pokmon anime, first cutting this (18th) season's episodes with hardly any reruns shown after overplaying the previous season, then removing them altogether and placing the current XYZ season (19th) in the 7 AM (Saturday) crap slot, just like they did with the final season of DP to make way for more of their own original shows. Might as well just wait for the whole XY/XYZ series to be released on DVD and binge watch if thats what it comes to........?????",1456358400,2,689,4.564516129032258

7132650,5,B00WICR2O0,Start of a great series.  Better writing and stories than in earlier Pokemon episodes.  It reflects the knowledge that much of the audience are adults.,1449187200,4,151,5.0
7132651,4,B00WICR2O0,"Pokemon is not digimon tri but either way whatever yourself or someone's  youngsters might've thought about pokemon I can understand....
I like it to be like digimon tri more but either way the show has a bit of a story for the characters introduced within this entire series so for....
With pokemon mostly encouraging them to be all similar to ash but also learn indirectly values like don't judge.
And only use the logic which helps out another in a situation and not use: the same  preconceived opinion that police use  in situations
Judging leads misunderstanding which usually can be resolved but ignored usually
Sometimes people disguise their objectives but realizing when to adjust to the inconsistent nature of situations isn't wrong...
 only time can lead to something
most important being resolved but this series will not be perfect but if you take it for what it does offer we can all enjoy it a bit.^^",1448150400,,915,4.846153846153846

7132655,4,B00WICR2O0,This is one of my favorite sagas for Pokemon.  The only thing that I would of like better though would if Pokemon XY had gotten to Serena's story a little faster the way Diamond and Perl had a nice balance between Ash's gym and Dawn's fashion performances. This set while having Serena team up with Ash and the others early on she feels more like a tag a long without purpose  during the 23 episodes here as she story doesn't really get going till after set leaves us.  I do love the whole Mega evolution and  Team Rocket is taken more serious like they were at the start of the series.  Ash shows his love for Pikachu and the other Pokemon in ways we don't often see.,1439942400,3,668,4.228346456692913
