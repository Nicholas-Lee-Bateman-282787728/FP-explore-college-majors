8618901,5,B00FWJPRXY,"I just watched Naked Dawn. It is much better than many A-films. It is in many way an unique film. It is filmed in real-looking locations with a good story and actors. At first you begin to wonder: is this really Arthur Kennedy. It can't be. He is so good as a Mexican. One believes in these people. Such things could happen. Edgar G. Ulmer is a cult director which is easy to believe after seeing this film. The less money he was given, the better the film. Perhaps not quite so, but he could do wonders with small money.",1390003200,2,521,4.22
