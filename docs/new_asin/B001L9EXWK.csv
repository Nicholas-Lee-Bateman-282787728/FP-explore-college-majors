3682199,4,B001L9EXWK,My kids were moving to Florida and none of the family had been there often or extensively.  This gave us all a chance to see the different areas together and start planning our future visits.,1375574400,2,191,4.457142857142857
3682200,5,B001L9EXWK,"This DVD exceeded my expectations by miles!  It's a most unusual travelogue, because all of it is photographed from the air!  You feel you are on a hang-glider, floating over all highlighted areas of the State.  It covers all Florida regions, from the Keys, to the Everglades, to major cities like Miami and the capital Tallahassee, to miles of beaches and favorite resort areas, plus wonderful wild areas like the ""forgotten"" gulf coastline of the Panhandle!

Having lived in Florida for over a decade, and having visited so many of the spots highlighted, it is a fantastic, nostalgic trip for me to enjoy, over and over again, watching this fabulous ""holiday"" on DVD!  It lifts my spirits, soothes my soul like the sunshine it so beautifully portrays, and I cannot think of a nicer treat for anyone who loves this fabulous state -- a perfect gift idea for anyone, whether they be a ""snowbird"", a Florida resident, or any dreamer who loves to ""travel by DVD""!

Grab this magical fantasy-ride, before it goes ""collector"" status, and you'll have to pay a mint for it!  It will instantly warm your heart and mesmerize your wander-lusting consciousness!",1362873600,,1150,4.866666666666666

The diversity of the the plant and wildlife here is unlike any other.  A beautiful place to live and a fabulous place to visit.  With two expansive coasts of fabulous beaches, world class amusement parks, hundreds of lakes and streams there is something for virtually everyone in Florida and this film pans over it all.",1256256000,9,480,4.482758620689655
