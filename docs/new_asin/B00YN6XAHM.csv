7223094,5,B00YN6XAHM,"If you are looking for an account of how World  War II was lost in the fields of battle you want find it in this two DVD set. After the war there were still millions of Nazis in Germany. This is about how the US and others went about handling the problem of taking these millions of Nazis who many had been taught the Nazis way of life from childhood back into humans who could see the world beyond the so called glory of Germany as taught by Hitler. It was not an easy task, but some how it was accomplished, but it took years. Why I was never taught this in school or college for that matter is hard to understand for the end of fighting was the start of another war. Do away with the Nazis belief system. All in all it was accomplished with great success. By that I don't mean all Nazis were converted however what was left and they were small in the end for the most part went underground. It is a well made story of real history that most of us never hear about and it is worth the watch. To learn more about the end of World War II and what took place all over the earth there is a set of CDs, The World At War. They will give you the complete story. I would have loved to had this set of CDs, The World At War, years ago.",1441843200,6,1228,3.9516129032258065

7223097,4,B00YN6XAHM,"This program, and others like it, should be required viewing for Neo-Nazis and Holocaust deniers. It's evidence from ""the horses mouth"" of the atrocities committed by a regime so sick that many German people tried to hide their accents after the war because they were so ashamed of the fact that they were German! I don't blame them.",1457481600,3,333,4.758620689655173
7223098,5,B00YN6XAHM,"I struggled to give this a 5 star rating because of all the editing dramatics and the jumping around in the program of those who were interviewed.

That said, this is the first kind of program about the Nazi regime that featured actor reenactment interviews (mostly) of little known Nazis.  From youngsters in the male and female Hitler Youth organizations who were brainwashed, to little known high ranking generals. A most interesting feature was the  interview of the actor protraying Rudolph Hoess, the infamous camp commandant of the Auschwitz death camp. Little has been presented about him in other programs except perhaps cameo appearances or explanations. This, despite the fact Hoess wrote a narrative about his experiences running a death camp  while in prison awaiting trial for war crimes.

The blending of the audio sound bytes spoken in german transitioning to the on-camera performances of the actors speaking in English was a unique twist I have not seen before. However, the show's producers went overboard on the repetitive visual effects; this may have comprised the integrity of the program. But not enough to distract from the material explored (that) was mostly new to anyone but the most learned experts on Nazi German history.

Many previous documentaries have always focused on the key players of the regime. This seems to be the first to focus on the little guy or lesser known participants. For that reason and the compelling stories I gave it 5 stars in spite of the visual hoopla.",1456099200,4,1510,5.02

7223103,2,B00YN6XAHM,"Some good information, but too hard to watch.  It seems this series was targeted to current generation audiences who have the attention span of a Labrador puppy.  Very short scenes with lots of cutaways.  Overbearing (!) background music.  Incessant recaps and overly repeated scenes and information.

If they had presented the same information in a less frenetic format aimed at more mature audiences, it would have been a good series.  As it stands it's like watching 5 hours of rock music videos without a break.",1445731200,9,515,5.0
7223104,5,B00YN6XAHM,"Wonderful production. Great history displayed in a dramatic way that showcases this important moment in history. I was very pleased with this product. A great tool for History classes or anyone who is a World War 2 buff, which I am. I thought this was one of the better documentaries on the Trials of Nazi's.",1442707200,3,308,4.618181818181818
7223105,1,B00YN6XAHM,"This is the first Amazon review I have ever written, and I feel compelled to review this DVD set because of the disappointment I felt when I watched it all.  I own all of the major DVD products of this genre and I must say a few things: It seemed to me that most of the presentation (obviously made for TV) wasted time in the theatrics of setting up the stage for the few (and I mean few) people that were reviewed.  Most all of the facts and conclusions could have been conveyed in a much shorter and more efficient time frame.  Many scenes were repeated in subsequent segments.  At the end of it all, I wonder why they chose the men and women they did to examine.  I think Gring, Kaltenbrunner and Ley would have been interesting.",1442275200,9,732,4.27536231884058
7223106,5,B00YN6XAHM,"This is a very good documentary focusing on the Nazis and their incomprehensible mindset that would lead them to so much evil. Thru the investigations done at the Nuremberg Trials, we see recreations of interviews done with the Germans and told in their own words. As a history/WWII buff, I'd say this film doesn't tell us anything 'new' about the Nazi atrocities--it just tells us 'more'  about their mindset and justifications. Told in a slow, simmering, style I found it riveting.",1442016000,6,483,4.962962962962963

8718523,2,B00YN6XAHM,"Some interesting new footage and home movies from the period, but basically this thinly-veiled ""documentary"" is a theatrical treatment of post-World War II denazification dispensed in rapid-fire, 12-second bites that are used to hide the fact that they are stretching the material through repetition and over-dramatization.  This quick-editing style is being employed more and more to appeal to younger viewers who can't stay with a story line for more than a few moments, and require lots of sound, flash, and jump-cuts to hold their attention.  As such, ""Last Days of the Nazis"" comes across less as riveting or horrifying, but mostly just annoying.  Much of this documentary could have been condensed into two hours or less (instead of the more than four hours of its actual length; two DVDs in this set) if you dispensed with all of the theatrics, computer-generated special effects, and aimless camera motion used to hold the interest of the young set.  Sad that material of this nature has to be jazzed-up to make it relevant for contemporary audiences, when the content itself should be enough to provoke rapt attention without resorting to special effects.",1485648000,2,1164,5.142857142857143
8718524,3,B00YN6XAHM,"History Channel programs are normally approx. 40 minutes, but with the lead-in after each commercial break and multiple re-caps, I feel like we're forced to watch 5 hours of information that covers 1.5 hours at most. The idea for this program is good, though it was confusing what was real archive footage of those speaking, and just general footage. The German beginning of each interrogation then blended into the English was strange and I found myself wishing they had the photographs of the actual people and not the actors. While there is a lot of new information here, it would have been much better presented if we were allowed to hear the actual interrogation tapes with subtitles. The way this was stitched together proved confusing and like another reviewer mentioned, geared towards those with a short attention span. I found all of that very distracting from what could have been a great program.",1485561600,,908,4.9411764705882355

8718526,5,B00YN6XAHM,"This DVD is excellent because it shows the pure hypocrisy that went into Nazi audiology. Basically, while they were winning, there are hubris was there a blatant arrogance. And then, as they realize that they were losing (and not just losing a little, losing horribly!) They started to try to change their town. Upon their ultimate defeat an unconditional  surrender, they all played stupid. Literally, they all pretended to not know what was going on. Basically, they're only defense was that they were just simple pawns in the German bureaucratic machinery. Of course, there are hard-core anti-somatic personalities still shown through and the post war interviews at this documentary Chronicles.",1472083200,,697,5.336363636363636

8718528,3,B00YN6XAHM,I think this is somewhat of a rehash of commonly available information. The dramatization isn't bad but ...I was expecting more information and less 'entertainment' value.
