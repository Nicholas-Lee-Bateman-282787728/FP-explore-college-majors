8479393,5,B005MIYI5S,This is a sonic thriller!  Mr. Trotter's technique is flawless and serves the music well. I could do without a couple of the victorian chestnuts.,1439596800,,145,4.8
8479394,5,B005MIYI5S,"Many time during my career as an organist and pastor, I've heard the complaint that organ music is BORING!!!! And that's always said with a roll of the eyes and a sigh that if one didn't know better, would signal certain death!.....
  Well, dear hearts and gentle people, THIS DVD and its accompanying CD will lift your eyebrows, wake you up and make you say ""UNCLE""....yes indeed!
  The recital is spectacularly filmed, edited, and presented. Thomas Trotter's well known playing capabilities shine and sparkle, and the music is spectacular.  The combination of DVD and CD are a tremendous investment. Our UK and EU colleagues in specialist media productions are true artists, as evidenced in the productions from Kings' and Salisbury Cathedral and other venues.
  The 'extra' tracks showing the time lapse of the hall's restoration, and the interview with Maestro Trotter are the icing on the cake, making the small amount of extra time for shipping from the UK seem insignificant.
  Thanks to the Regent company for their superb work. Well Done, Folks!
  A note to Organists and Anglophiles out there....Don't miss this one!
