5074145,1,B007BOCBS2,Terribly disappointed the movie is boring. Not much else to say I wouldn't  recommend to anyone. We kept waiting for it to get better but it never did :(,1397692800,2,153,4.275862068965517
5074146,5,B007BOCBS2,"I really loved this kooky movie! It was strange in a good way. I highly recommend this movie. I thought the ending was awesome. I get mad at bad endings,but this one delivered. Even though it was full of men,it's a great movie for women too.",1393372800,2,241,4.260869565217392
5074147,4,B007BOCBS2,had read a review about this movie a long time ago. I really liked it. My husband thought it ok.,1392249600,,96,3.85
5074148,2,B007BOCBS2,"I tried to watch this, and it was a struggle. I just couldn't get into it. I may try again, but it was slow to develop.",1389139200,,119,3.6153846153846154
5074149,4,B007BOCBS2,"Sweet. Tender. Awkward, yet warm.  It's certainly no no shoot 'em up, action flick.  Ed Asner leads a talented cast that will make you smile and cry at the same time.",1389052800,3,166,4.32258064516129
5074150,4,B007BOCBS2,"Good men's movie...relationships between/among characters are very real...tells well the story of difficulty men have to relate with one another...main character does not see a reason to be in the ""club"" but there is one and he finds it...tale of Elephant Sighs being heard a long way off is like the sighs of the main character, who doesn't know what's wrong with his life...he finds out...he needs other men, not for sports, or games, or money, but just to be part of a group, to ""sit in circle"" with these guys...these homely, some fat, some old, some crazy guys all going through life alone but for this group...",1386374400,7,616,4.712962962962963
5074151,4,B007BOCBS2,"""Elephant Sighs"" fits in the narrow category of simple, unique shows.  Although it is slow moving - or perhaps at a 'deliberate' pace - the story is worth seeing to the end.

A young, socially inept lawyer who is new in town finds himself included in a men's club of sorts.  The other four men welcome him and go about their normal bickering and commiserating but never explain why they meet.  He thinks the situation is confusing, but he cannot extricate himself politely.  Enduring a sometimes-stressful afternoon with the group helps the lawyer to discover more about being human than he learned from a lifetime.

Of late, all films seem to copy old, shopworn stories.  I was pleased to see something different in ""Elephant Sighs.""",1383177600,13,734,4.824
5074152,5,B007BOCBS2,"ELEPHANT SIGHS is a well-made, thoughtful, warmly funny, and moving little film.  It has a top-notch cast of familiar character actors led by the wonderful Ed Asner. The movie seems to start slowly as we meet and get to know the characters - but that's the point.  Stick with it and you'll be rewarded by the unexpected and moving ending.  This is a movie with something to say and is a breath of fresh air.",1348444800,9,407,4.4
5074163,1,B007BOCBS2,Terrible,1474848000,,8,8.0
5074164,4,B007BOCBS2,Took a while to get where it was going but worth the watching. It was first written as a play and it has the look of a play. It tried to fill in spots with non needed outdoor scenes which brought unnecessary length to the film. It could have been shot using one set. The room where they met each other.,1474848000,,302,3.9672131147540983
5074165,5,B007BOCBS2,An odd & somewhat disturbing movie about relationships.  All the actors did an excellent job.  Highly reccomend!,1473292800,2,112,5.529411764705882
5074166,4,B007BOCBS2,"A bit slow and low budget at times, but really comes together nicely.  I'm not looking to give a lot of info - just wanted to rate it 4 stars to encourage more people to watch it as it is a quality film.",1468627200,,203,3.7209302325581395
5074167,2,B007BOCBS2,"If you're patient and looking into the dialogue I've read there's something to wait for that apparently makes the movie worth it. Unfortunately for me, I couldn't make it past 15 minutes. The dialog is slow, there's no indication of whats going on, and the characters leave something to be desired. Had I not read the movie description I would have had no idea what was going on.

For example, one of the first scenes the main character goes into a restaurant where a man he walked past in a previous scene calls him over to talk. They introduce themselves then they cut to a shot through the window where you can't hear what looks to be important dialog. Next thing you know he's in a room with another man setting up for what seems to be a small group meeting. Since I read the description I knew they were meeting for a ""Mysterious"" reason but knew no more, I'm sure as intended. Other than that curiosity, there was nothing keeping me there or giving any indication that the plot was actually moving.

And as far as the actors, they all seemed to be new to acting.. it wasn't bad but there was some suspended disbelief there. By trying to make the characters more real they made them unbelievable and awkward. The next scene had two people come in arguing, one a former preacher, and the other... who knows. I didn't get that far. But the argument was childish and felt as though it belonged in a children's comedy. There was no depth or belief to the argument and you just felt embarrassed for them. Finally there was just something off about all of the actions, the words, the interactions between characters. Nothing seemed to be real, it was all just slightly awkward.

Maybe, if you give it time its worth it. I'm just not willing to invest that much time.",1467244800,,1765,4.492211838006231
5074168,3,B007BOCBS2,"This is labeled as a comedy but it is not. Oh, there are moments of humor to be sure but this more of a mystical drama than anything else, heavy on symbolism. It's certainly not for all tastes but if you enjoy a movie sans explosions and car chases (although there is a subdued car chase herein) this might be up your alley. It's based on a stage play and it comes off as one, although handled deftly in a cinematic way. One reviewer wrote that you will spend most of the time wondering what is going on but if you stay with it, the ending explains it all quite satisfactorily. I think you'll catch on to what is happening well before the ending but it's a nice little film. An actor's showcase.",1467158400,,695,4.2330827067669174
5074169,4,B007BOCBS2,"Quirky, odd, poignant movie.  Takes a bit to get involved with it.  I recommend it.",1461542400,,83,4.466666666666667
5074170,1,B007BOCBS2,"First, when you watch a ""screen adaptation"" of a play, you expect it to be adapted. This was the equivelent of watching a one-set stage play in a b-rate theater. Second, I can't imagine seeing it as an actual stage play would have made the story line any better.  Trying to be vague and edgy just resulted in being maddening and lacking any real plot structure.",1457308800,,361,4.46969696969697
5074171,5,B007BOCBS2,Takes a long time to get to the point. Worth watching to the end,1456876800,,64,3.642857142857143

5074184,4,B007BOCBS2,A nice simple movie that makes you think.,1453507200,,41,4.25
5074185,4,B007BOCBS2,"I wish I could award half stars because I would give this 4 1/2 STARS if Amazon would let me.  This is not a flashy movie.  It doesn't have an exotic locale.  It isn't going to win any cinamatography, special effects, or costuming awards.  This is simply a play that was filmed.  It is very low budget, and the film quality is poor.  So why did I think it was so GOOD?  It is a character-driven movie with poignant dialogue.  A man comes into a community center on the invitation of a very engaging, friendly stranger.  He doesn't really know why he's there or why he's been invited to join a small group of men.  Who are these men?  Why are they in this community center?  What is their purpose?  And who IS Leo?  All of these questions, and more, are explored in this charming little play.",1451606400,,791,4.292517006802721

5074187,5,B007BOCBS2,"A subtle message in this movie that doesn't become apparent to the end. When I got to the end, I said, WOW, that's a pretty great move.",1440979200,,135,4.037037037037037
5074188,3,B007BOCBS2,Very odd movie. It felt like I came in during the middle of the movie and never caught up on what was going on. Enjoyed seeing Ed Asner though and appreciate his commitment to helping independent film makers to get their start. I was also attracted to the film because it was made in my home town and I was looking for places I could recognize.,1436400000,,344,4.2272727272727275
5074189,4,B007BOCBS2,"Great show, Ed Asner is wonderful in this, and the rest of the actors were all well casted in their parts.  Very good feel good flick on the importance of friends and support - whether you have anything in common with them or not, friends can truly change a life.",1433721600,,263,4.26
5074190,5,B007BOCBS2,A lot of people felt it so slow or whatever that they stopped watching.  I do that myself but in the end it says more about us and our modern attention spans and lack of emotional depth IMO.  This is a great little movie and especially for many of the reasons it got panned here.  Of course nothing is for everyone but if you can't relate to being afraid then it's pretty likely if psychologists are right that folk are just too shut to admit to it.,1431734400,,449,4.137931034482759
5074191,3,B007BOCBS2,"A bit more tightening on the editing and this would have been really excellent.  Great actors and pretty good theme, but a little too easy to just get lost in the story, idea, aim.  It took clear to the ending to get that great punch of meaning, and by that time I imagine most folks had stopped watching.  Definitely a confusing film.",1428710400,,335,4.370967741935484

5074193,1,B007BOCBS2,"Theatrical does not mean boring.  I wouldn't want to turn people off from ever going to the theater.  That's rewarding and fun.  This is an annoying attempt at being deep, written by someone who should find another line of work. Bad.",1426291200,,233,4.634146341463414

5074196,2,B007BOCBS2,"You need to be in a patient mood for this as it's a play about nothing much like Seinfeld was a tv show about nothing. Having said that, they are very different, Seinfeld is very funny and this had little twitches of humor that do not make up for nothing very happening. Stopped watching after 35 minutes.  My husband fell asleep.",1416787200,,330,4.409836065573771
5074197,5,B007BOCBS2,"I'm a woman, but I don't see it as just a ""man's movie."" Support and honest communication have never been more important, but always cost the lose of something vital; like jobs, relationships & family b/c too many are afraid to do so for the very fear of losing the same things. ""We murder self when we become so disgusted living a life so far from the life we always wanted to have. When all avenues of hope are exhausted, some prefer to die in a moment rather in inches,"" Kristen Williams. This movie so eloquently displays this issue in society & what a few other people going thru the same thing can do to save each other. I'm just waiting for a herd of elephants to come charging into my front door any second now!",1413072000,4,719,4.294117647058823
5074198,5,B007BOCBS2,I like the ambiguity of this film....slow paced (nice change from our rapid fire society). Highly recommend,1412121600,,107,5.352941176470588
5074199,4,B007BOCBS2,"Solid performances across the board, especially by Ed Asner. The supporting cast are actors with whom I was not familiar, but after seeing their work, I can't understand why. Quirky sweet story.",1409616000,,194,5.09375
5074200,3,B007BOCBS2,"It was very slow, the characters were generally difficult to relate to, and while the ending was satisfying, we're not sure it was worth the time.  It has value, but... how much, and to whom?",1407196800,,191,4.457142857142857
5074201,2,B007BOCBS2,"the pacing is slow, on purpose, the character is withdrawn and introspective and we've seen this before many times. it has some balls for reintroducing Ed Asner but that tanked too. im just glad he's still alive.",1403740800,,212,4.756756756756757
5074202,5,B007BOCBS2,"I do not normally comment on movies but I feel that this one deserves a disclaimer of sorts. For about an hour I found myself wondering why I was watching it. I listened to the other reviewers though and waited it out, and I'm happy I did. The ending was super sweet!",1399852800,7,267,4.153846153846154
8514030,4,B007BOCBS2,"Slow;  Yes.  Awkward;  Yes.  Relevant though, because for many that describes their lives.  The ending is why it got a 4th star: Ed Asner is how it got its 3rd, so without those it would be a 2.  Not very well produced, probably only cost about $100.00 to make, I bet all the actors did it for free.",1502755200,,299,4.068965517241379

8514037,1,B007BOCBS2,"I tried to watch this because it said it was based on a hit play and had good actors in it. I tried four times in fact. Even so, I only managed to get a little over half way through. I have never been so bored in my life. Never. And I have a high tolerance for low key wordy dramedies. I would not recommend this if it were the last movie on earth. Seriously, go and do something less boring instead.",1476403200,,400,3.8902439024390243
