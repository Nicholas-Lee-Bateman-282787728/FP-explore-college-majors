3747092,4,B001PCNZJU,"Bushido is alive and well in this movie. This is a retold tale of 47 Ronin (masterless Samurai) who seek revenge after their master (Lord Asano) is forced to commit seppuku (ritual suicide) after mildly assaulting a nasty court official. I have not seen any of the other versions of this tale to compare them to this film. As the title of the movie suggests this film is all about the complete loyalty and honor these Ronin feel in planning and staging the murder of the rude court official and the others responsible for their master's death.  Their planning for the attack lasts over a year and they do so knowing they will have to commit seppuku themselves for carrying out this crime. Dressed In Lord Asano's colors and insignia they avenge their master. There's something thrilling about seeing a sword fight take place against the timeless background of a wealthy, traditional Japanese home. This movie is more of a drama than an action movie as the action lasts a relatively short period of time compared to the long length of the movie.  The sets and costuming are impeccable, however the acting is sometimes a little over the top and melodramatic. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie though and would recommend it to those seeking a Samurai genre drama. This is definitely a keeper DVD for my movie library. I give it 4 stars. If you are looking for something in this genre with more blood spurting, limb chopping action then 13 Assassins by director Takeshi Miike would probably be more your cup of tea than this film.",1348444800,8,1524,4.704119850187266
3747093,5,B001PCNZJU,A good traditional japanese movie with good solid acting and tells a good story although not totally accurate it was entertaining,1339372800,3,129,5.190476190476191

3747095,5,B001PCNZJU,"There are a number of versions of this story available on DVD.  This is certainly one of the best.  The plot develops along  traditional lines.  The characters are revealed as the tale unfolds.  The scenes are carefully shot and the costuming is wonderful.  There is only enough action to carry the story forward and not overwhelm it with violence.  Even if you have another version of this film, it is worth having this one.",1268006400,26,425,4.662162162162162
3747096,4,B001PCNZJU,"My daughter advertised to me this less known piece of cine-art. I was intrigued and ordered a DVD for myself. It should be shown to every civilized person! The film is not just well-designed and beautiful (and it is indeed!!!) - it shows special Japanese mentality concerned with sometimes very vague notions (for Europeans, alas) like nobility, trison, responsibility, good and evil, word of honor, and lot of other ""nonsenses"". Although the plot is not very complicated, the film could- and must be viewed many times!
Highly recommended!",1252713600,22,539,5.136363636363637
3747097,5,B001PCNZJU,"I heard the story of these ronins before.  Watching it was a lovely experience.  They show how dedicated and persistence they are regardless of how people who wanted them to avenge their master and leader were harsh on them.  The mother was upset that her son didn't avenge his master, the father in-law and other close people all were rejecting that these ronins weren't moving towards vengeance. But, these ronins were discreet and careful in their planning and finally succeeded.  This is a lovely movie, it has nice setting, slow paste though, and marvelous story.",1242345600,21,568,4.947368421052632
3747098,5,B001PCNZJU,"As a collector of period piece movies, the Loyal 47 Ronin met all of my

I highly recommend it.",1424044800,,169,4.666666666666667
3747099,5,B001PCNZJU,"This is a story about a situation in ancient medieval Japan that is honored even in todays world some hundreds of years later.  It will help if you have some background into this culture at this , especially medieval Japan.  There is a special monument and burial site for these men.  These men followed the ancient 'code of bushido' as samurais.  ""Duty, Honor, Justice"" is but an attempt to make a literary description that is not even close!  Also, there is a love which accompanies this story.  This is a legend, that to this day, some many hundred of years later, that these ""47 Ronin"" are still honored by people from all over this world!  On my next trip to Japan, I will make an extra special side trip to this site, so that I can homage to this group and the 'ideal' they served!  This film is now showing on HBO.

3747104,5,B001PCNZJU,"The Loyal 47 Ronin sticks to history, and is nothing like that BS movie that they made recently. It is in Japanese, with English titles. The costumes are brilliant. I bought it, that's how much I loved it! It was absolutely wonderful, and told the tale as it was, when it happened. It was like watching the Japanese ""Cecil B. DeMille"" creating a story!",1405123200,3,352,4.515625

3747106,4,B001PCNZJU,"You have three choices if you want to see this classic Japanese tale about honor and loyalty.  There is this one, by Kunio Watanabe, which was made in 1958.  There is The 47 Ronin by Kenji Mizoguchi in black and white, long (222 minutes), and made in 1941.  And there is Chushingura, made in 1962 by Hiroshi Inagaki, which is probably the best known of the three.

All three are good choices.  One advantage to The Loyal 47 Ronin is that it is the shortest; still 166 minutes, but the other two are well over 3 hours.  And you get to see the actual fight scene.  In the 1941 version, after the viewer waits three hours, the revenge happens off camera.  But in this one, they show the 47 Ronin, resplendent in matching Samurai outfits and beating war drums, take their revenge on Lord Kira.",1399680000,9,789,4.393103448275862

3747112,5,B001PCNZJU,"Historic and a classic movie.  The movie tales of bushido, honor, justice and revenge.  This tale is almost in the national psyche of Japan.  While the Tokugawa Shogunate could inwardly admire the actions of the 47, they could not condone it otherwise there would be anarchy if every revenge was metered out.  In the end the 47 were ordered to commit seppuku",1394236800,,358,4.725806451612903
3747113,5,B001PCNZJU,"I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys Japanese Classic Theatre.  Fans of Zatoichi (blind swordsman) and Shintaro Katsu will enjoy this movie.  Yes, there is not a lot of swordplay but there is a lot of action of a different kind.  Anyone who has read the story of the 47 Ronin will see that this verison of the movie follows the historical story quite closely.
Looking for Samurai Blood Fountain Theatre?  Sorry.
Looking for something more like the Kenau Reeves movie?  Sorry.
Looking for a very well done movie based upon a classic story of Japanese History and Literature?  You've found it.
My wife even liked it and she's not that big of fan of the Zatoichi movies.",1390521600,11,687,4.636363636363637

3747117,5,B001PCNZJU,I bought the older version made in the 60's and this newer version by accident.  For what ever reason I over looked the fact that they were both 47 Ronin story. I watched them back to back and I must confess I like both equally well.  Sort of like seeing two different groups do a Shakespear play.  I was so sure after the first one that this one could not do any better but I was wrong.  I would recommend either or both.,1349913600,9,422,4.048192771084337

DVD
1958

Film = barely three (3) stars; costumes =4.5 stars; cinematography = 4.5 stars; translation = 4.5 stars; subtitles = four (4) stars; studio set design/dressing = four (4) stars; score = 3.5 stars; sound dubbing = three (3) stars;  choreography = 2.5 stars.  Director Kunio Watanabe's lush version of a traditional (about 300-year-old) folktale demonstrates the destructive impact of excess.  Watanabe provides just about too much of everything (including film run time) except for ""epic-grade"" exterior locations (the movie is almost completely sound-stage bound) and dramatic clarity (the viewer often needs a score card to keep track of all the machinations of such a huge cast).  Samurai in this rekishi geki (historical drama) may be masterless ronin, but they are far from impoverished judging by their life styles and wardrobes!  (As an aside, although the major plot point is focused on seppuku and the script bushidou revolves around threats of indoor seppuku, emerging historical research indicates that seppuku rarity occurred during this time period and, when it did, it was mostly on the battlefield to avoid capture.)  The costumes are spectacular, but may have seriously handicapped the stunt actors attempting to perform convincingly during the film's climatic fight scenes (the costumes look like they are just too heavy/bulky to allow for proper sword swinging).  Sound dubbing during this battle fails to render clashing swords that sound like steal instead of wood.  Although studio sets are well done, it is often obvious that sound-stage exteriors are phony.  All opening credits are translated!  An extreme rarity.  (But there are no closing credits.)  Subtitles use three colors to separate lines delivered by two or more characters (including overlaps in speaking) and expository information.  The latter is presented at the top of the screen usually simultaneously with dialog subtitles shown at the bottom of the screen.  It's close to impossible to read three steams of data at once on first viewing.  Also dialog subtitles are usually too long and screen flash rates are too fast.  Cinematography (wide screen, color) and scene lighting are excellent.  Score is fine for a smallish orchestra.  Worth watching particularly if you are interested in what Old Japan costumes may have looked like in action.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1465862400,,2538,5.319095477386934

8333096,5,B001PCNZJU,"The tale of the 47 ronin is Japan's ""Gone With the Wind""; and is Japan's national legend. The story is a true one. This really happened in Japanese history. The acting in the movie is superb and the makers of the film spared no expense in costumes and sets which easily transports the viewer of the film into 18th century Japan during the Age of the Shogun. Shintaro Katsu, star of the very successful ""Zatoichi"" (The Blind Swordsman) movie and later television series, plays the role of the leader of the 47 ronin (a samurai without a master). This movie must be viewed several times; in order to understand this beautiful foreign culture which is so alien to ours. I really enjoyed this foreign film.",1443225600,6,702,4.624
