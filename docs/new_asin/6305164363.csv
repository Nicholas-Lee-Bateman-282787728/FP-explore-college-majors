7883928,2,6305164363,I wasn't pleased with the fact that the yoga workout came in VHS only and not DVD. The beginners yoga VHS tape was kind of boring only including one exercise that repeated over and over. I do like the relaxation technique exercise very much and would give that portion of 5 *,1522281600,,275,4.3076923076923075
7883929,3,6305164363,"Nice routine, but Denise talks too much and moves too quickly.  I suggest after learning the poses that you turn the VCR sound off and put on your own music.",1300406400,,157,4.233333333333333
7883930,1,6305164363,Wrong VHS was sent with no receipt.  Did not order XTRALite Beginner's Tone Up!  I ordered XTRALite Beginners Yoga! Will not order again.,1292630400,,137,4.913043478260869
7883931,5,6305164363,"I needed a simple video for my morning Asanas to go with the Ayurveda diet plan for my Dosha type and this one was perfect for me.  Denise repeats each exercise so you can learn the move before going on to the next one.  I hate trying to keep up with sprinting exercise teachers and Denise goes slow enough so even seniors can keep up with this one.  I love it.  My three year old now does the Morning Asana part with me every morning.

I have flattened my ab, lost five pounds and feel much better health wise since using this one.  I want to see results without a lot of sweat or grunt work!  This is the one for me!

The background of Mountain range and the landscape scenes are beautiful as well!",1125792000,3,700,4.133333333333334
7883932,4,6305164363,"This is a very good place to start if you're new to yoga. Denise covers the basics and takes her time with the stretches. Sun salutation is a good way to end the exercise. The only drawback I found is her patronizing way to say you're doing ""wonderful"" and everything is ""beautiful"". How can she see me? I don't look that great!",982368000,10,328,4.306451612903226
7883933,1,6305164363,"I'll give Denise one star for being a nice person and meaning well.  I have some of her other exercise videos, but she is NOT qualified to be a yoga teacher!  I now have a lot of yoga videos.  Most of them wisely  emphasize the importance of proper breathing in the learning and practice  of yoga, and Denise barely skims over this very important aspect of the  practice.  Without this instruction, the student misses the whole point and  therefore cannot possibly benefit.  That's reason enough to pass this one  up--unless you want to watch Denise do a ""Look what I can do!""  routine.",945388800,21,586,4.592233009708738
7883934,3,6305164363,"Serves a good purpose if your not a Yogi, warm up try it and pass it on to someone. If you want more. One Yoga class costs as much as the video.  I tried other Rachel Welch for example forget it you need 20 years exp. to  do. This one is short enough so you do not have to organize your entire  life around it.",944784000,4,310,3.7384615384615385
