Long story short they both fall in love with each other and later she gets her singing voice back by a miracle and her ex manager later becomes exposed and Karma gets him when he no longer can speak but you have to watch the movie to find out why.  All in all it has a good plot, nice songs and acting isn't bad.",1446163200,,1830,4.049861495844875
