1900426,5,B0000A0WHR,"When I originally heard about these discs I thought that it was just some cheapo gimmick to sell films that are otherwise on $1 DVDs.  But when I received this set as a gift, and tried them out, I was extremely surprised and delighted.

Watching this in our living room (with a nice 34"" HDTV widescreen monitor, Pioneer DVD player, and Logitech Z-530 computer speakers... yes, they have true 5.1 surround sound) was quite an experience!

The sound for the film emanates from the front left speaker, while the ambient noise comes from the other channels.  It was fun but a little disconcerting to hear crickets, gravel, and the low rumble of cars in our living room.

Our second play of these films was outside, in our backyard.  We hung a white sheet on the back of our house, rolled out our trusty video projector (we have an old Kodak LC-500), portable DVD player, and a set of plain old stereo computer speakers... the experience was simply AMAZING!  The ambient sounds on the disc blended in with the natural sounds outdoors.  We really felt like we had been transported 40-50 years back in time.

The movies included are true, vintage, drive-in cheese.  But are representative of the type of films shown at drive-ins during their hey-day. I won't offer a review of the films because... well, you can find reviews elsewhere, and the cinematic qualities of the films presented are not the primary reason for buying this set.

I highly recommend this set for anyone who remembers those drive-in days.  (don't bother with the individual discs... get the set!)  I also recommend picking up a video projector (they are only $200 ""brand new"" and are sold as ""video game projectors"" on eBay), cheap self-powered speakers (that's why PC speakers are so handy), and a DVD player (only $30 these days).

For under $300 total you can get the ""full effect"" of these discs right in your own backyard.  And relive a little bit of history.",1128816000,20,1928,4.713432835820895
1900427,5,B0000A0WHR,"The good people at Elite entertainment deserve plenty of praise for this brilliant work of art.  I couldn't beleive what I was seeing, between realistic ""other soundtrack"", including the gravel and the comments, to the generous amounts of lost snack bar commercials and cartoons, as well as other reels whose exact purpose still baffle today.  This is the real thing and of a quality almost NEVER seen in a DVD package.  Any true fan of the drive in or crappy movies can concider their arm very much twisted.",1073952000,14,508,4.75

7995154,5,B0000A0WHR,"I love watching old drive in promos and intermissions, and this disk is just chock full of them. If you love promos, intermissions, and old movie promos, this is the set of disks for you!",1404259200,,187,4.371428571428571
7995155,5,B0000A0WHR,I thought this experience was forever lost to me.  What a delightful surprise to be able to take this journey again.  The B Movies with the drive-in neighbors took me to a time when I fell asleep in the backseat of my parents car.  I made my mother wake me up over and over so that I wouldn't miss the endings.,1391731200,,310,4.049180327868853
7995156,2,B0000A0WHR,"These are horror movies with an embedded sound effects track--tires on gravel, etc.  If that were a separate disk it would be fine but not.  May return this.",1380672000,,157,4.571428571428571
7995157,1,B0000A0WHR,"This could have been great.  However, the ridiculously annoying and rude background voices over everything Classic is abhorrent.  The female voice is especially annoying.  The comments are stupid and rude and would be the thing that would make you really leave the Drive-In.  EPIC FAIL on the bootleg, obnoxious background comments.  Stay Away !",1379116800,2,345,5.314814814814815
7995158,5,B0000A0WHR,"I love this three disc set, reminds me of the times when I visited and worked at the drive in.  The films are not great, I have better individual copies, but the ads are wonderful. (the cartoons are a bit different but enjoyable)  The countdown clock is the best and because at my own outdoor theater when it tells me there is two minutes or so till showtime I think to myself ""you want a bet?"" but yes, a very enjoyable trip down memory lane, I enjoy it every summer when I have my own ""Drive in"" happening.  one question though, on the National Anthem part at the end where it goes ""and the Land of the Brave"" it has a question mark.  what's that about?",1348704000,,655,4.174603174603175
7995159,4,B0000A0WHR,"I found this set in excellent used condition fairly cheap so I decided to give it a shot. The set features six early low budget films on three discs. There are some interesting and fun drive-in/movie theater intermission commercials and promos, plus some old cartoons. Anyone who was around during the ""good old"" Drive-in days will remember these nostalgic clips.

The set also includes an option to have some familiar drive-in noises such as footsteps walking through gravel, car engines and people cackling or asking their friends to get them a hot dog while there going up to the snack bar etc. It's a fun set and would be great for a Halloween movie marathon or any get together with friends who remember going to the drive-in.

The films aren't great, but they are a lot of fun. Some of these films can be found in better shape, but the prints here aren't too bad. I don't think there is a high demand for these films in pristine condition, so the set is fine by me.

This is an interesting and fun set, but I think there are more promos out there and some other classic drive-in films that could make up another set. Overall if you can find this cheap it's a pretty fun trip back in time.

Below is a list of the films included on this set.

1)The Screaming Skull - 2 1/2 stars
2)The Giant Leeches - 2 stars would be higher if not for cheap production
3)The Wasp Woman - 2 stars silly fun!
4)The Giant Gila Monster - 2 1/2 stars hard to dislike!
5)I Bury the Living -
6)The Hand -",1242259200,3,1486,4.330935251798561
