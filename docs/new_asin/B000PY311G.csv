8193872,5,B000PY311G,"Gundam seed is one of the more modernized Gundam entries. The 2 previous shows, Gundam wing and 08th MS Team were pretty good. Gundam Wing had okay animation, but the voice cast was bad on the english dub. 08th MS Team has ok voice acting, but the animation was kind rough. Gundam Seed has neither of these problems. It has really good animation and pretty good voice acting. The soundtrack is also really well done. The story is also more interesting. There are some major plot twists and some great conflicts between the characters. It definitely deserves the 2 seasons that it ran. With lots of great characters, a pretty in depth plot and high quality production it's definitely my favorite Gundam since the original. You should give it a chance. I hope you like it as much as I do.",1355356800,,786,4.581560283687943

8193874,4,B000PY311G,"This last volume was very good, it remind me of the quality of the first season.  This show is great but far from the first season, I don't like Shinn as a lead character, if the show shifts the attention to Kira and Athrun in the last volumes it could be pretty good!",1188950400,,268,4.056603773584905
8193875,4,B000PY311G,In this disk we find that Kira didn't die(go figure LOL) and that the earth alliance is getting ready to take on Zaft. Athrun is furious over Shinns actions and shows it in hitting him when Shinn comes bragging about his victory over the Freedom. Athrun and Shinn are offered new mobile suits and of course Shinn is excited over this. Athrun though is very troubled with the Chairman over his decision with destroying the Archangel. I won't say anymore...you will have to see it for yourself. It gets very good. This series is good so far but I don't think it beats the original Gundam SEED. 4 stars for this disk. Check it out!,1181174400,3,628,4.469565217391304
