8323549,1,B000I0QLMI,"""Illicit Affairs"" is a two-disc, four-movie set, supposedly a collection of low-budget movies that are erotic in nature.  Overall they all are extremely low budget in quality, style and content; hence one movie was fair (by erotic thriller standards); one was bad; and two were so awful I spent most of the time fast-forwarding through the films, nudity, violence and all.  My synopsis of each film is as follows:

Obsessive Affairs: A dreadful story of a recently paroled prostitute and drug addict who struggles to remain on the straight path.  The movie had only three characters in it (a fourth had a total of 15 minutes screen time).  The movie has the worst production value where no effort was put in writing, scenery, set development, and especially acting.  There was awful dialog between the main character (prostitute), her analyst, and her former (and current) pimp.  The story was ridiculously predictable, and the erotic elements was a virtual snoozefest.  The sex scenes were slow and ridiculous, with the main character only exhibiting partial nudity and the men none.  Overall it was the worst erotic thriller I've ever seen.

Savage Vows: A standard horror-slasher film with a 1970's feel to it, though not in charm and nostalgia, but in overblown camp and cheap feel.  The story is about six people who are in a cabin in the woods, and are killed in  horrific manner (sounds familiar?).  Only the special effects are so cheap there was nothing horrifying about the violence.  I can't  understand why this movie was added in this collection in the first place, given there was virtually no erotic elements.  There is no doubt that clever high school students can make a better film than this one.

Revenge of the Wives: This was bad, but an improvement over the first two films.  Three women whose cop husbands were killed are recruited to work for the police (as a drug dealer, a mobster's girlfriend, and a prostitute) to help bring their husband's killer, a big-time mobster, to justice.  What??  What police department would ever have three housewives infiltrate a ruthless criminal operation in order to bring down a criminal enterprise?  The premise is completely ludicrous, but at least this film makes an ATTEMPT at some originality.  That said, the acting was bad, the effects cheap, and it looks like it was filmed in a vacant office and someone's small colonial home.  There was attempt at eroticism (especially a humorous, yet unremarkable S&M scene), but no nudity.  This was a bad film, but better than the first two.

Sunset After Dark: Unquestionably the best of the lot.  It's your standard erotic thriller with a SkineMax of the late 1990's feel.  A young, broke screenwriter moves into an apartment building with a collection of strange, quirky (and at times dangerous) tenants, including a sexy femme fatale portrayed by the young and very sexy Monique Parent (aka Scarlett Johansing).  Anyone who is an aficionado of erotic thrillers and dramas is well aware of Ms. Parent's ""body"" of work.  The police believes her character instrumented the death(s) of her husband and lover, but have no proof.  Naturally the writer is taken by her sultry advances.  I think you can guess where this is going.  That said, compared to the first three films, this one is like an Oscar winner by comparison.  There are two VERY hot sex scenes Ms. Parent has, which that alone makes this cliched story worth watching.  While this was not the best erotic thriller ever made, it was okay, and after watching the first three films, this was a treat to sit through.

I hate to say this set is certainly not worth spending your good money on, given three of the four films are totally unwatchable.  Even with ""Sunset After Dark"" being a good erotic thriller, I'd say you'd have to be the hardest hardcore fan of Ms. Parent to justify spending money on this set.",1200355200,2,3877,4.8567073170731705
