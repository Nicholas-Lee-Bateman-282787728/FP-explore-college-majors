7793292,4,0876045999,"I originally bought this from the A.R.E. probably in 2008.  I am a die hard Edgar Cayce fan. I just re watched this 4 dvd set, with a run time of 4 hrs, 45 minutes.  Each person on their own dvd.  I guess you could call it something for everyone.  The first 2 dvds had good information but were slightly too humorous for me, with almost every other sentance containing a joke.  E. Cayce says it's important to have a good sense of humor and that the Master (Jesus)  had a sense of humor himself.  So I guess I fall short here, most things I watch are to learn, and I like depth.  So depth is where the last 2 dvds come in that I personally preferred.  Mary Roach was especially good in describing what she sees as the differences in different generations life purposs  and the changes from the Picean Age to the Aquarian Age now and for the future.  Peter Van Daam had a very good talk about setting your Ideal which is a core Cayce principal.  The production itself was one of the better filmed A.R.E. dvd sets I've seen,  I hate to say most I've seen were almost amateurish in video and audio.  The only caveat here  (I wear headphones, a night owl with cardboard walls) is they blast the introduction A.R.E music starting each dvd and the speakers are a lower volume so progressing to the next dvd you get blasted !  Then anywhere they have audience q's , you can't hear , then need to turn the volume way up. You'd  think a meeting place for  ""sensitives "" would pay attention to those things!!!  I am one, and especially my ears !",1465344000,,1535,4.267361111111111
