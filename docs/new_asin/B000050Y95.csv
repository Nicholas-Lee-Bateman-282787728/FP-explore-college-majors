7929148,5,B000050Y95,Old fashioned good guy wins is nice to relax to sometimes.  Quality if OK for the money.,1447286400,,88,4.176470588235294
7929149,3,B000050Y95,"This plot seems to take Baroness Orczy's hero past a point
of believable. I enjoyed the period plot,
but having read much about this era
I thought the dress/ costumes in the movie a little clean
for the terror era in France.
The sense of desperation that ruled at this time seemed absent
as well. People were turning their friends and relatives in
and heads in the thousands were rolling.
The male actor Richard E. Grant just isn't very convincing
as the Pimpernel.",1256083200,,465,4.614457831325301
7929150,1,B000050Y95,I bought this video to use in my classroom. It wasn't until I received it in the mail that I saw on the side that it was BOOK THREE!! There is nothing in the description that says it's book three. Be advised - this is not the movie version of Orzy's original novel. I am SO disappointed!!,1044057600,,288,4.0701754385964914
7929151,4,B000050Y95,"Richard E. Grant has an oppertunity to show his talent in the A & E Pimpernel series, and he doesn't disappoint. I've been a long itme fan of the Scarlet Pimpernel, so I'm apprehensive each time a new version comes out. This version does not disappoint. I recommend it to anyone, but especially those who haven't been introduced to the Scarlet Pimpernel before. Enjoy!",1026691200,5,368,4.765625
7929152,3,B000050Y95,"This is probably the best episode of the tapes I have watched so far (from the first season).  The story, be warned, differs greatly from Orczy's version.  However, we see more of Robespierre and of Chauvelin, including a remarkable turn of the former sans wig and makeup - but even more intimidating.
The story line begins with a dramatic kidnapping of the Dauphin (actually the legitimist King of France, Louis XVII) by a man in a red mask.  No, this is not the Scarlet Pimpernel.  From that point, things go from bad to worse for many characters - Robespierre relies on Chauvelin to discover the Dauphin before his enemies get hold of the story, Sir Percy experiences some matrimonial difficulties (or does he?).  The only person truly happy seems to be Chauvelin - and does he have a reason.
There are some shockers in this episode - and I won't give them away, except to say that people have motives other than what appears, and people are not what they appear.  And for once, the Scarlet Pimpernel does not come off scatheless - he is nearly beaten in a duel with a vicious opponent.  But fear not, the Pimpernel triumphs in the end, and none of the main characters in this series is killed off in this episode (unlike in the first episode).
Having bestowed praise where it is due, I have the same old quibbles. Firstly, although the story is a brilliant adaptation, it is hard for purists to swallow (Orczy having already provided a version of the royal escape in EL DORADO).  Secondly, the characters of the League are replaced, again, by some interesting French characters who aid Sir Percy.  Thirdly, the Pimpernel and his principal follower exhibit remarkable stupidity or lack of caution again - in openly avowing their identity amidst a crowd.  [This is always the part hardest for me to swallow].
It is fun though to see Sir Percy teasing Chauvelin who knows his true identity, and then having Robespierre turning around and saying.. [well, see the film to see what Robespierre says].
If you are addicted to this version, this episode is a must-see, the strongest of the lot, and probably the one that best depicts Sir Percy and Marguerite as a passionately-involved couple. No orgy scenes either.  If you are a purist, you might still want to hold your nose and watch this version for an alternate-reality take on Orczy's versions of events.
The one quibble I have - as a lover of the great music and cinematography in the first episode - is that this episode somewhat falls down on these points.  In particular, the duel could have featured more compelling music.  The music from key episodes in the first episode stuck with me, that from this episode does not.  I wonder why.  The cinematography is also nothing compared to the amazing angles and lighting used in the first episode.",992908800,,2799,4.706967213114754
