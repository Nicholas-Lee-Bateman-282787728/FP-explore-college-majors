7933744,5,B000059MCT,"A lot of good info here for the beginner. Marks is somewhat non-traditional as a guilder and cuts his own path. I love the creative approach, and being a woodworker like him, I really connected with his presentation.",1364256000,,216,4.7105263157894735
7933745,5,B000059MCT,"To my knowledge, this is the first in-depth how-to video on the application and patination of metallic leaf. And an excellent, inspiring presentation it is. Baggot and Marks, each with years of experience in the field, demonstrate the handling, cutting, and application of true gold and silver leaf, as well as patent or Dutch metal varieties. They also thoroughly cover preparation and sealing of porous surfaces (wood, ceramic, stone, etc.), as well as oil-based sizing techniques.
Marks demonstrates three exciting, experimental gilding methods of applying copper, silver, and gold leaf over Japan painted wood surfaces. He goes on to show how to mix several popular patination chemicals and apply them in combination with metallic powder sprays. Rich variegated colors are the result, as well as stunningly dramatic shapes which he describes as ""free form,"" ""undulating,"" and ""taken from nature.""
Gilding is an ancient art and its techniques are generally thought to be arcane and stringent. Baggot and Marks show how it can be user-friendly, fun, and a great medium for experimentation. As an artist and a craftsman always on the lookout for new techniques with unexplored potential, I found this to be a wonderful and enlightening video.
