8397740,5,B0017OGOI0,"This is my favorite Sci-Fi movie but the first release on VHS tape was to my taste better.  The DVD which I bought a couple years ago had been cleaned up in that the vibrator first used for the starship was replaced by plastic model of a space ship and was not in any way fun or in character with the spirit of the movie.  Having the cast flying through space in a giant sex toy was.  The second promblem with the reissue was that some of the cardboard sets were replaced by more 'star trek' prop.s that was also an error, as the cheaper the sets were the funnier the movie was.  But even if this is the second issue it will still take you where you have never gone before and where Star Trek hasn't the bolds to go.  If you're gay or even just like drag and haven't seen this hang down your head in shame until you do.",1283644800,3,819,4.030864197530864
