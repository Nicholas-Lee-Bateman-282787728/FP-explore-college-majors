I've been striving for success but had hit a road block, I love how Gary's book inspired me to get my head down, work hard and achieve my goals. I'm now sailing along and I've got this book on my bookshelf ready to pick up when lack of motivation strikes.",1344643200,,408,4.311688311688312
8059380,1,B0009DWW5Y,"This guy messes with your mind and smiles in your face while he does it. It's not worth the money. I've read the book and purchased this dvd and it doesn't help at all. The only self-satisfaction I've aroused by having this book and dvd is when I dropped them both in the garbage. Try reading a good researched book by Dale Carnegie, anything else then a book like this filled with opinions, endless/useless personal stories about flying planes, and getting divorced by his wife. I should have known this guy was rubbish and a gimmick when I first learned of this book from a crappy talkshow. This is just Gary Coxe's next hustle, after all, he is an oppurtunist and if you look at his official site, he has a ton of self-help books (that don't help at all), cd's and dvd's priced all the way up to $300, this man makes me sick.",1171065600,11,828,4.348387096774194
