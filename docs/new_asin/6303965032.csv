7862495,5,6303965032,"I first saw this film in 1997 when I was an exchange student in Belgie.  It touched me then as a snapshot of a hardworking ever resilient culture of the Flemish.  I tried finding here in the US when I came back but it was still priced at over a hundred dollars.  Several years later I'm ecstatic to find the film not only available, but affordable.  The Flemmish are an amazing people and this is a film of overcoming struggle.",1004486400,2,427,4.3
7862496,5,6303965032,"""Daens"" tells the true story of a Catholic priest in late 19th century Flanders. Tiring of his university position he joins his brother, the printer of a Catholic newspaper in Aalst, Belgium, in a battle against  the monied ""directors"" of sweatshop cloth factories, their hired  bullies, and the conservative elements of the Catholic Church. Fr. Daens is  able to unite the left-wing Socialists and the centrist Liberals to form  the first of the populist Christian Democratic Parties. He is elected to  the Belgian Parliment and forced from the priesthood.  The film is  filled with colors. Belgium of 100 years ago is successfully depicted--even  if the film crew had to go to Poland to find it. The story, however, is  told in black and white. We know very early which side wears the  ""white hats."" In this battle it is more often the low black hat  of a parish priest against the red hats of bishops  and top hats of  industrialists. Pope Leo XIII is left off-stage, something of a mystery.  A realisticly depicted rape scene and scenes of police brutality will  require a preparatory discussion for pre-teens. The film is otherwise good  fare for families and recommended for Catholic Youth discussion groups.  English subtitles are supplied throughout as the dialog is in Flemish,  French, and Latin. The switching by the industrialists from dignified  French at work to folk Flemish at home is one of the many little insights  that the American audience will miss. Unfortunately. For those who speak  French--and much more for those who speak Flemish--Daens is a delight to  the ear. For older Catholics the portions of the Latin Mass will bring back  memories.  Highly recommended.",924998400,5,1689,4.9928057553956835
