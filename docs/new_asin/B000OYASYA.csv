8187281,5,B000OYASYA,"Interesting look at the technology thats driven war in the past  and what new technological advances could do to warfare.

Popular Mechanics is one of my favorite magazines. Yeah, I know, thats a crazy thing for a chick to say, but the most recognized science and technology magazine capture my attention years ago, when writers did a cover story on the Titanic, complete with intricate details of the ships layout and what would happen if it was raised. It was told in a way that even a young person like myself could understand. (I was what, in my early teens maybe? I still have the magazine stored in a trunk somewhere.)

Today, Popular Mechanics is taking to the tube, delivering a fascinating look at the art of war  and advancing technology that is changing the rules of warfare.

This two-disc set delivers fascinating, up close looks at every branch of the military and breaks each section down into mini-sections to highlight the most important technologies available and combat techniques. It shows how the various branches locate the enemy and protect each other using censors and satellite technologies. Each segment is narrated, with interviews interspersed throughout featuring comments from current military officials, researchers and former heroes like Chuck Yaeger. You get the historical view first, complete with some cool footage, then current information, followed by upcoming technological advances that are no longer classified.

One of the cool technologies coming out next year comes from the Navy, which has developed these small, fast littoral combat warships to take on enemies in places that large military vessels cant go. It will also allow Navy men and woman to launch from smaller vessels, and allow for the launch of electronically-controlled ships that can act as sentries or mini-assault ships. These remote controlled ships give Game Boy addicts a new career path: You have to maneuver it from a controller similar to something from a video game.

The Future of War segment is cool, because it starts off with a sample of what happens within each branch when war is declared. It was nice to see this without the drama of a TV show. It also emphasizes the necessity for super computers to engineer the best equipment and keep all branches in touch with each other. (If I were a computer geek, Id be stalking companies with $$$ military contracts after watching this.)

After watching The New Technology of War, I doubt I could get into a modern Bond movie. Its all been done! I can dig the classics simply because they are, well, classics.

Now, some might say this is a pro-U.S.A. video because of the way the narrator talks about America and its allies, and the fact that there are no hard questions given to military officials interviewed. But really, questions about war and death and the militarys inability to protect soldiers do not fit this piece. This is for research, military history buffs, authors who want to know more about equipment used in war, or people just interested in documentary-style films. Its conversational and interesting enough that it could peek the interest of some who would normally not watch shows on the military.

Most of the sections are good, but I had a hard time getting through the counter-terrorism section simply because Im tired of hearing about it. No offense to troops or military families; I could just do without it for a day on the news.
Included in the case are two DVDs with five segments on ground forces, air power, sea power, counter-terrorism and the future of war.",1423267200,,3557,4.933110367892977
8187282,5,B000OYASYA,"This is one of my favorite series! It is a five show series showcasing the cutting edge military technology.
Each show is about 50 minutes long. The episodes include:

Disc 1
Ground Forces - focuses on the latest technology the Army has developed for its Future Combat Systems series of vehicles.
It showcases Blue Force Tracker which helps to identify and track friendly as well as enemy positions to cut through the fog
of war. Also showcases the Stryker armored vehicle and the technology it has.

Air Power - focuses on the advanced technology developed by the Air Force and NASA, in hypersonics, stealth (F-22 and F-35), precision
guided munitions, nano-technology, laser weapons(ABL), UAVs and satellites.

Sea power - focuses on the latest Navy and Marine technology. Featured are the Littoral Combat Ship, DDX, CGX, advanced gun system, discuses
network centric warfare (information superiority), F-35 and the Navy's design for a new class of aircraft carrier. The Marine technology
focuses on the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle and the advances in technology and capability it will give the Marines.

Disc 2
Counter-Terrorism - focuses on the technology and equipment being developed to protect us from terrorists. It includes scanners,
sensors you will probably find being used by TSA in the future. Details the use of drones (Predator UAV) to patrol and monitor
the border.

The Future of War - includes segments of footage from each of the above shows. It is more like a summary of the other four shows.
I tend to watch this episode when I do not have time to watch the more detailed shows above.

This collection of shows is an excellent showcase for the advanced technology being developed by the military. The only downside is that
it was produced in 2007 which makes the content dated to the time and the plans of the W. Bush administration. Some of the programs
discussed have since been cancelled. That said, this is still one of the best series of shows on advanced military technology available!
I would highly recommend this to the military enthusiast looking for a good documentary on military technology. The graphics/CGI is very
good and is mixed in with actual footage of hardware such as tanks, ships and aircraft. The technical experts and military officers
do a good job of explaining technical subjects in a way that is understandable for the average citizen. You can't beat the price/value
of this collection! What you get with the subject matter and content is better than a lot of other military documentaries. Even though
some of the weapons programs have been cancelled, I believe that future weapons programs will include a lot of the technology covered
in this series. I wish Popular Mechanics would make more shows for adults in the future, because this collection is terrific!",1371945600,,2814,5.002136752136752
