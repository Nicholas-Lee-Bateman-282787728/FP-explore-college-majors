8617510,3,B00FP20P80,"I got this DVD set just to watch Invasion of the Saucer Men, a movie I fondly remember seeing as a kid. The quality of the film picture and sound are acceptable for a B-movie of this age. However the film itself in this set has footage cut out. Notable cuts are close ups of the aliens, seeing the dead alien under the car and pretty much the whole fight scene between an alien invader and the bull.",1407801600,2,399,4.128205128205129

I am reviewing this particular product quality.  For a description of the movies and critical review of them others have done that and you must seek them out.

Nice compact box with three discs well protected.  The booklet and the graphics in the DVD menus are fun and well done and have a character all their own.  Good job there.  No chapter menu just the either or movie menu on each disc.  Can skip through chapters with your remote though.

Disc one
Zontar: blurry.  Kind of a sepia with intended or un intended hints of color rather than black and white or color.  The sound is good enough but not great; a bit muffled.  The version I rented on Amazon instant view (not currently available to rent) was way better. This INVADERS version is watchable but will leave you searching for a better copy.

The Brain from  :  True black and white. The sound is just fine.  In decent focus ( better than Zontar) just a touch grainy.  As I remember the instant view that I rented was higher quality but this INVADERS copy is quite good enough.

Disc two:
Invasion Saucermen  This is the movie I bought this set to get.  The movie is true black and white.  Very good quality.  I have seen better (not Saucermen just B&W in general) but this copy is great and the best quality movie in the set.  The sound is quite clear; really great.
How ever . . . there is one little glitch.  Not far into the movie two army officers are preparing to go out to investigate the landing site and the film stops and starts and the sound drops out a few times.  Not an important scene and you totally understand the gist of what they are saying.  The first time through I thought it might have been my blue ray player but I just watched it a second time and it is definitely a problem with this second disc of this set. Or more likely a glitch in the master used to make these discs.  I can live with it.  Just glad to have this film.

Beyond Space
This is a color movie.  I have a much better copy on a DVD just of this movie.  The elevator to the under ground installation is supposed to be bumble bee black and bright rich yellow.  In the INVADERS set movie version it seems to have a gray cast and is more an erie light gray green.  This kind of adds to the weird atmosphere but if you want to know how the movie was intended to look buy some one else's product.

The picture is dark, almost too dark to watch, hard to see some of the faces in some shaded or night scenes where in my good copy you can see much more detail.
Grainy or more precisely checkery during quick motion in the movie.
The sound is fine.  Just a hint of hollowness as if listening to it through a pipe and a bit of hiss on the S s but NOT a constant back ground hiss.

Disc three
Robot Monster
True black and white.  Kind of blurry.  Whites overly bright.  Watchable.  The version I rented on instant view was in focus and better quality.
Again a bit of a graininess  with motion almost as if it were wet around the moving areas.  Not really a problem but may leave you looking for a better copy.
The sound is good enough.

Phantom From Space
Overly dark in any shadow scenes.
Very blurry
In the well lit scenes it is washed out.
I have a really nice quality version on a single DVD so they are out there to buy.
This  INVADERS version will leave you disgusted if you have ever seen the version I have.
Barely watchable if you are desperate to see this movie.

A shame because this is quite a good movie as far as the acting and story.  I re-watch it often.
The sound is way better than the visual quality.  Some back ground poppy static that comes and goes. (I don't mean the geiger counter ha, ha, ha,)  Often it is not there.  Not a real problem. Not as good as my good copy though.

I really agonized over buying this for roughly $33.
I have all the movies except Saucermen and Zontar.  So for me it was $16 each to get those movies. The Zontar version is only worth about a dollar and a half quality wise and I will buy a better version as soon as I can find one.
So . . .
$31.50 to get Saucermen;  not a particularly good movie but I was obsessed to get it and did not want to go with a PayPal transaction.  I feel Amazon is safer.
I sure payed a premium to get this one movie.

PS: The booklet for this and the other movies must be considered a plus but is just a write up of the story for each movie and a few facts about each.  No big deal. The storage case for the discs is quite good compared to some of the paper covered spider webs that some sources provide.",1391040000,6,4538,4.138602520045819
