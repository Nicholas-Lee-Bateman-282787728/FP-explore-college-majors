8376619,5,B002P4CGM4,This was a really cool dvd. I liked its ease of use. It requires repetition: you won't be perfect at it until you do it a lot. That's the same with anything awesome.,1370131200,,165,4.03030303030303
8376620,2,B002P4CGM4,"This is not a DVD that you are going to be able to plug in and ""go"" with. The person in the video goes right into the Tai Chai routine and it is very hard to follow.

There is some instruction, where you watch the practitioner from behind, but it is very odd because you can't see what he is doing in front, where most of the arm movement takes place!

I have a Yoga from a Chair, Pilates from a Chair and Stretching from a Chair DVD and I was able to jump right in and do the exercises right from the get go with them.

This is a video that I feel I will have to study before I can do it. By that time I will most likely have lost my momentum and interest.",1363392000,,657,3.781021897810219
