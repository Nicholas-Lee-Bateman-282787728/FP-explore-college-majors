The United States Submarine Service was responsible for placing the United States in a winning position.  After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Cdr. Murray announced to his submarine skippers as they headed out on the hunt,  "". . . the submarines are all we have left.""  These submarines eventually would destroy the Japanese merchant fleet and cripple the Japanese Navy.  2% of the United States Navy, the Submarine Force was responsible for sinking 55% of all Japanese ships that were sunk.  Japan was fast running out of fuel, war materials and everything else their Island nation required to keep the war going.
These Submarines also helped locate the fleet for the surface ships,  rescue downed pilots and all while operating on their own.
We lost 52 submarines, submarines that continue on eternal patrol today.  Their memories are kept alive by memorial submarines around the United States and by Submarine Veterans from all eras who ""Toll the Bells"" for their lost shipmates.
This video is a tremendous testament to those valient men of WWII. Gil Raynor, SS, USN Retired",970963200,7,1189,5.061538461538461
