8316103,1,B001GX32HS,"This ""instructional video"" contains very little information about the camera and its operation and consists--90%++--of a very cursory overview of digital photography in general.  It is clear that it is a ""generic"" title with about a 10% segment dealing with the 50D thrown in.  Neither the generic segment nor the camera specific segment is at all informative or well done.  In particular, the camera specific info is inferior to what one gets from speed-reading the camera manual (and--if you know what camera manuals are like--you know how awful this is).  I've seen vastly superior videos for other cameras from other producers.  Lets hope that someone else--anyone else--does one for the 50D.

By the way, Amazon refused to post my first review of this camera. Seems I used a naughty word.  The word, contained in the title describing my thinking about the marketing material surrounding this product.  It began with the letters fr and rhymed with odd.  Think about it.

8316104,2,B001GX32HS,"Your first thoughts after reading the title might be ""A video manual for my 50D, how nice"" Not even close. The only video on this disc is basic SLR operation of any camera. I found this very disappointing as I wanted to learn some more details about my menu system and some other tips and tricks that I may have missed in the owners manual.

The only training relating directly to the 50D is interactive. This is very tedious and very much a waste of time since navigating the button on the DVD player only to read what the function does, obviously takes more time than looking it up in your owners manual.

I gave this 2 stars only for the fact that it offered some descent practices that may help a novice SLR user.",1230249600,2,717,4.303703703703704
