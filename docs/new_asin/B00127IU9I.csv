3078004,1,B00127IU9I,"Too many dead end dramatics. Not enough proper lighting when it was necessary to see what was happening on screen.

I never quite understand why a plot is hidden.  No explaination as to why things are happening to the characters.  The dialog was muffeled and I found the sub-titles were way too small for my old eyes.  Not a great combination for keeping up with a difficult storyline. The heavy breathing, panting and gasping for air was constant and very annoying.

In one final burst of action, POOF... the movie was over and done.  I'm really not sure what happened.  Is there a Part 2?",1261267200,,590,4.561904761904762
3078005,3,B00127IU9I,"Experiment (Dan Turner, 2005)

Here's an interesting little flick that could have been really good, a kind of update of The Manchurian Candidate with a much smaller milieu and a cool sci-fi twist, but it loses its way just a few too many times.

Anna (Georgina French in her first film role) wakes up in the middle of the road in what seems to be a nameless Eastern European country (we find out later it's Chechnya), having been dumped out of a van in the opening scene. We soon find out that she is unable to speak, nor to remember anything. Meanwhile, Morgan (John Hopkins, no doubt soon to be a household name; he's in Tim Burton's upcoming Alice in Wonderland) also wakes up with no memory, but he finds that he has been taken in by a seemingly benevolent old man named Joseph (Bird Feeder's Nick Simons). Joseph discovers a picture Morgan has on him, and written on the back in marker is ""MORGAN FIND ANNA."" But with no memory, how is he going to do so? And what happened to his memory in the first place?

It's not half bad, really, though some of the acting could have been better (and in at least one case, a whole lot better), and the script keeps teetering on the brink of being too complex for Turner (Big Mistake) to handle. This was his first film, though, and given the amount of potential it had, I'm kind of willing to give him a pass on it. Not at all what it could have been, but intriguing nonetheless, and worth checking out. ** ",1251331200,,1450,4.339483394833948
3078006,5,B00127IU9I,"I really liked this film. I first saw it in the UK. It deserved all the awards it picked up. It's shot in drab colour giving it a Gothic feel,and apparently completely on location in Prague (so adding to the Gothic feel). Good cast, great acting, chilling atmosphere to the piece as the story is as blank as the memories of the two leads who open the story. Slowly everything is understood, but there is a painful twist in the tale. Had me thinking about it for days after. Now I own the DVD. Bit of a cult classic, this. Well worth getting. More drama than the sc-fi box it's been put in, but whatver  - it's plain entertaining. Don't know what else Dan Turner is directing, but I hope we get more like this...",1204243200,11,711,4.266666666666667

3078022,1,B00127IU9I,"First of all, I want to warn you about the reviews on this movie. This is not, I repeat it is NOT about the Stanford Prison Experiment. All those talking about their PSYCH class, or Prison Experiment, are reviewing the wrong movie!!!
So be warned:  those big star reviews are about a completely different film . This is a one maybe a two star movie at best .
Okay..here is my review of this Eastern European based film.
Have you ever watched a movie... Like all the way to the end... For some reason hoping that it's going to actually get good?. But of course it doesn't.  you can tell that it every single interval in the movie. You can tell that it wasn't going to get any better. But for some reason, whether it's the idea of the movie, or the name, or the actors, you just felt like maybe, just maybe, it was going to be okay. Yeah, well this movie is like that.  It does NOT get any better.  So, if you don't believe me, watch the first 10 or 15 minutes and if you find yourself wondering ""is this going to get any better"", just turn it off. Because I promise it does not get better.",1497657600,11,1088,4.166666666666667

3078051,2,B00127IU9I,"This movie is one big yawn.  I thought the opening 15 minutes and Georgina French's initial absolutely convincing terror were worth hanging in to see what played out in this movie.  Ends up, three quarters of the way in, there simply isn't enough depth to this story to keep me interested at all.  Two foreign people wandering around confused and terrified in a strange city while being manipulated by a computer program operated by sadists conducting a mysterious experiment ends up being, well, just plain weird and boring.

3078062,2,B00127IU9I,"The ""Experiment""(2005) is directed by Dan Turner. This film starts off quite poorly, with poor scripting, and mediocre acting, but does pull itself together about half way through to at least qualify as an average effort. The best thing about this film though was the haunting cover. The idea itself, about two people who have lost their memories after being experimented on and then released into the urban environment so as to act as assassins of government officials, also isn't terribly original, and is scripted in a way that isn't very inspired or dramatically convincing though it does have a okay semi-surprise ending. Just barely entertaining.
P.S.  This film shouldn't be confused with Paul T. Scheuring's film with the same name, ""The Experiment""(2010), staring Adrien Brody",1444521600,,785,5.23015873015873

Regret is the last thing someone should feel while watching a movie, and sadly, I regret wasting my time on this movie. On a positive note the movie ended. Go do something better with your time and skip this movie.

EDIT: I now know why I was falsely lulled into thinking this was a good movie; the over 60 reviews attached to it are for a different movie by the same title at this link: http://www.amazon.com/The-Experiment-Blu-ray-Brody/dp/B003VEL9E8/ref=cm_cr_pr_orig_subj -- that movie features Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker!

3078096,3,B00127IU9I,"The Experiment (Paul T. Scheuring, 2010)

As is almost always the case, there is a lot of hooting and hollering on the internet about how The Experiment is yet another crappy American remake of a movie that is much, much better. And in many ways, I tacitly agree with it; Olivier Hirschbiegel's 2001 film Das Experiment got four stars from me and is pretty high up in my Top 1000, while this remake gets two and a half stars. But I feel I kind of need to defend this movie from some of the aggressors, because the arguments I'm seeing...don't make a lot of sense when you compare the two films. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

Plot: The Experiment's title makes a good deal more sense to students of recent history when you put the words Stanford prison in between them. Twenty-six men are chosen from a pool of applicants. They are divided into guards (nine) and prisoners (seventeen) and put into a small, self-contained world meant to resemble a prison...and then the watchers sit back and see how long it takes these people, who were for all intents and purposes equals on the outside, to fall into their roles, with all that conveys. The two groups shake out pretty quickly into their natural orders, with pacifist Travis (Oxygen's Adrian Brody) becoming the de facto leader of the prisoners, and meek office worker Barris (Panic Room's Forest Whitaker) finding himself in the odd position of being the leader of the guards. You know where this is going, but there are other interesting/dramatic/amusing side stories being played out as well.

CAUTION: The next paragraph contains spoilers for Hirschbiegel's movie. Be warned.

The main argument I keep hearing about how much better the 2001 film is in comparison to this one is that it's closer to what really happened. I'm sorry, folks, but that's sheer, unadulterated bull[censored for Amazon consumption]. Do you really think that daring escape in the climax of the 2001 movie happened that way? (Christina Maslach, upon whom Franka Potente's character was based, did object to the experiment, and it was her intervention that got the experiment shut down, but she did not help bust the prisoners out.) Based on a true story means exactly that, and the folks who are writing the screenplays are going to change details for dramatic tension. And, given that a decade elapsed between the two films and that they were made in two different cultures, the details the scriptwriters change are going to be different. The particular hidden side we end up seeing to Chase (Easy A's Cam Gigandet) was added because that's a part of the American public consciousness/primal fear; the screenwriters in Germany might not have even had it cross their minds, because it's not the huge bugaboo in Europe that it is an America. If you're going to complain about a movie for working strains of tension inherent to its culture, that's not a problem with the movie.

That said, where the movie went was kind of predictable, and in ways I wish it hadn't been. It makes sense in the scope of the film for Scheuring's screenplay to have most of the prisoners be shallow stereotypes, but that doesn't make them any more satisfying (and it also tips his hand as to one character who becomes an unwitting catalyst to the events in the final quarter of the film; it's an ambitious play, but because of the way Scheuring structured his characters, it doesn't have the impact it could have). And, well, the climax, which has taken so much heat...it's obviously drawing from Hirschbiegel rather than actual events, but where Hirschbiegel threw in a curve ball or two (the major one is alluded to above), Scheuring went with the most logical probable outcome, after throwing in one character revelation that made not one damn bit of sense (nor of difference, when it came right down to it), and robbed much of what should have been a fist-pumping satisfactory climax of its rah-rah-rah-ness. (That said, he does set up the denouement, which is quite the depressing anticlimax, and in many ways it's the most effective part of the movie.)

I wanted this to be a better movie than it is. But with that said, I rather liked it; any chance Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker get to flex their onscreen muscles is probably going to be worth at least a watch, and neither disappoints here.

The movie beats you over the head with the power trip of the guards. They spend most of the 90 minute film testing how terrible they can be to the prisoners. They are limited only by the rules of the experiment (and they have to abide for their cash reward). Soon though the rules disappear from the film's focus and its all about how psychotic a few of the guards are. 'The Rules' are supposed to protect the subjects and govern the experiment, with a red-light bulb to symbolize their code. This stupid red bulb does not go off until after these acts: violence, pissing on prisoners, attempted rape, more violence, and murder.

The movie wraps up quickly, thank god, with an unbelievable ending where they all ride home together. Such a waste of talented actors.",1397347200,2,1042,4.537234042553192

3078105,4,B00127IU9I,"The movie is based on the psychological experiment done at Standford University Prison in 1971. Twenty-six participants were selected randomly for the experiment. Six were made prison guards, and the rest inmates. For two weeks they had to follow the strict rules set by the experimenter - prisoners to obey the rules and guards to enforce. At the end of two weeks, each one will be paid $14,000. However, if rules were broken, or any participant wanted to quit, or any kind of violence occurred, the experiment would be terminated with red light and siren, and everyone will forfeit their contract money.

As the experiment proceeds, within few days big disparity starts to occur between guards and prisoners. Pride and ego emerge to dominate and so the animosity. Quickly both camps forget the experiment and things become real and surreal. Participants take the roles too seriously and over enthusiastically. The guards starts giving psychological torture to the prisoners especially to whom they consider as leaders and dissidents, mainly to one prisoner named Travis (Adrein Brody). On the other hand, one of the guards Barris (Forest Whitaker) turns into totalitarian dictator and sadistic madman. As the guards become more cruel and authoritarian, prisoners become more defiant. We know instinctively where this going to lead ultimately. The situation goes from bizarre to violent as time goes by, and get shockingly bad towards end. I had my hair standing on my back, emotionally draining. It just got crazier and crazier at the end. I felt very uncomfortable at the last half an hour, and could even feel extreme anger building inside me towards the guards and their extreme behavior. I was literally shaking (I also forgot for a while that I was just watching a movie!).

Finally, in day 7, violent war loose break between guards and inmates, and the experiment comes to an abrupt end. The story shows how people transform themselves after becoming authority figures and start abusing the power (Take note supporters of despotic government!). A very shocking movie indeed! A good lesson to learn, but not an easy movie to watch. This is not a movie for soft-hearted or very young. Please be ready to get thrilled and shocked more than entertained. May be disturbing movie for some. I had never seen a movie like this before for its emotional shock value. I must give at least 4 out of 5 for the way realistically story is portrayed and for the thriller. Total running time is about 96 minutes.

3078107,3,B00127IU9I,"I picked up this movie from a Blockbuster store that was going under for a whole $2 on Blu Ray. Honestly, I didn't even know Adrien Brody was in it, but when I saw that he was, that's when I really gave the movie a try. I loved him in The Pianist and in The Jacket. As the movie got underway, I then saw that Forest Whitaker was in the movie as well. It was then that I felt the movie really had some legs to stand on so I was a little excited.

I was let down.

The performances by Brody and Whitaker are quite good. Brody plays the role of a peaceful, everyday Joe who answers an ad for a controlled experiment with the promised pay day of $14k. Once there, he meets Whitaker's character who is presented to us as a devout Christian. After some prescreening, both of them, along with several others, are selected to take part in the experiment. Once they arrive at the facility, it is explained to them that they will all be divided into 2 groups: one will be prisoners and the others will be guards. There are a few rules given to the guards as soon as they are getting dressed to start the experiment. Whitaker's character is selected to play a guard while Brody's is to play a prisoner.

******SPOILERS AHEAD! STOP READING IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW SPECIFIC DETAILS!******

The concept is laid out cut and dry for us and you can almost immediately tell where this is headed. Still, you find yourself wanting to watch. As the movie progresses though, there is a major plot hole that, in itself, almost does the movie in. A character by the name of Benjy is selected as a prisoner. It is later revealed that Benjy is diabetic. He lies on his application for the project by saying that he controls it with diet when he actually has to take insulin injections. On day two of the experiment, he asks for something to help with his blood sugar levels which are getting low. In most cases, a diabetic with low blood sugar could simply have a decent meal and be just fine. However, instead of simply giving him food, the guards ignore his request and leave him in his weakened state. Being from a family of people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, I can assure you if Benjy had not gotten something to eat, he would have been in very serious danger of going into a diabetic coma. From the signs he was displaying, it looked as if he was in dire need of something to eat. Yet, he supposedly goes another full day without eating. He is simply shown laying down in his cell the entire time while the rest of the prisoners go off and have their three meals. Not eating for an entire day can be tough on the average person, but for a diabetic it might as well be a death sentence. Any person with diabetes would have surely succumbed and, at the very least, gone into a coma. Some would have probably died. Later in the film, Benjy ends up getting the insulin he brought with him, but was not allowed to take into the experiment. Having not eaten for an extended period of time, no diabetic would then take insulin as it is used to keep blood sugar levels low. Only if Benjy had been eating should he have taken his insulin. Adrien Brody's character is seen later bringing Benjy a single piece of bread which is not nearly enough for a diabetic to survive on. It is this glaring oversight that, for me, discredits the film as far a believability.

Another issue, although smaller, is the set itself. All the participants are supposedly housed in a brick building. During the climax of the film, several prisoners are seen running through a hallway and as they push their hands up against a brick wall, you can actually see the wall wobble. I know you have to suspend disbelief when you watch a film, but the mistakes were so obvious they were hard to ignore.

Some of the violence feels very contrived. One of the first disagreements between the guards and the prisoners happens when a prisoner accidentally hits a guard in the face with a basketball. Apologies are given immediately. As a way to punish the prisoner for this, he is asked to do 10 pushups. While the prisoner is a little older, ten pushups seems reasonable and actually very light as far as punishment...yet, he still refuses to do it. From there and through the rest of the movie, the punishments escalate.

Brody and Whitaker do turn in very good performances which is why I granted the film the rating that I did. Without their star power and talent, the film is pretty much a throwaway. Clifton Collins, Jr, while not as big a star as Brody and Whitaker, did play the role of a member of the Aryan Brotherhood very well and his performance should also be seen as a bright spot.

The rest of the performances felt weak to me. I just couldn't buy some of the others guys in the movie at all. I don't know if it was their performance or if Brody and Whitaker simply outshined them to the point where they came across as first time actors.

The transfer to Blu Ray was quite good. The sound quality was there and the picture was clear and crisp on my 48"" HD television. The coloring in certain scenes just shined. I wish more films were transferred as well as this one was.

Overall, I can see why the film was a direct to video movie. It really is a shame though. Given the two leads, you'd think they would have had someone fact check more on the writing side. It's not often you get two men who both won Academy Awards into a film together. While some might find the film good, I have to say that it is average at best and the only reason to give it a look is because of the performances turned in by its two stars.

3078109,4,B00127IU9I,"Looking at just the plot, this movie is fairly average.  A sensational interpretation of the Stanford Prison Experiment?  Some pretty cheesy dialogue? A splash of gay panic?  All check. But look at that cast...

Forrest Whitaker has the standout performance here.  Take his character from Ghost Dog and replace the glorified samurai ethic with a suppressed semi-sexual desire for dominance, and you have a good starting point for his character here.  A quiet, seemingly good-natured creepiness exudes from him that you rarely see outside public transportation.

Adrien Brody, of course, is a great actor.  I've yet to see anything he's acted poorly in.  He gets some boring lines in this movie, but he acts them damn well.

And a few bonus points to Fisher Stevens for doing his best 70's Zimbardo impersonation.  Really, both do a really good job of conveying a scientist that has possibly gone a bit nuts.

And don't forget the jerk from Easy A, and the bad guy from Crank: High Voltage, and wasn't that guy in Black Snake Moan?  Really, the rest of the cast is just kind of there, but Whitaker and Brody carry a lot of this movie.

3078110,4,B00127IU9I,"Honestly, the movie does not reveal anything new--that we all have animal instinct, and both Jungian school of psychology and traditional school of thinkers have already hammered that point. There is a reason we use, in our vernacular ""The Angel"" and ""The Devil"" in us. It shows, how, given enough stimulus,our demon self can reign supreme over our concept of self. From a conceptual standpoint, there is nothing new here. As physical animals, our physical preservation is linked with our psychological sense of self and vice versa. So, threat to one triggers conjugal reaction for self-preservation. What is so new about it? The movie has one fatal flaw, and that is about technical aspect of it.
(1) The red light was supposed to go on whenever violence takes place. But it seems that the researchers awaited a death and till the end to do so. It does not ""commensurate"" with the premise of the movie, since to the end, the director still wants us to believe it was an experiment, just got a bit extreme.
(2) The system set up was such that there was a binding condition to get a certain amount of cash, but the table of power could have been altered easily, since one group outnumbers the other.
 So, I think the movie was in reality a weak one. But it passes as a yet a decent art work, due to the intense scenes and a sense of optimism.
 Those who have never accepted the fact that they carry a demon within, the shadow self, are naive; and those who submit to the demon and fail to promote the angel within to march with the demon with necessary solidarity are immature and need grow up further.
 The concept of the show is unique. I stand by my rating though, that it is a 3 to 3.5 star movie.",1354233600,,1700,4.459807073954984

They arrive in a facility and are split into two groups; 6 will act as guards and 20 will act as prisoners in a prison simulation. What we get as the audience is one stunning experiment worth watching.

Adrien Brody plays Travis, the leader-like figure for the prisoners, and Forest Whitaker plays Barris, the leader-like figure for the guards. Brody and Whitaker are both spectacular in their roles, and especially liked Whitaker's power hungry roles. The story moves at a very fast pace and focuses on the problems with violence (in life and prison) and emphasizes the change that we can implement as humans; however, it does not preach. It works mostly off of its engaging dialogue and arguements and some violent, disturbing scenes of discipline. The ending was great, as well.

Overall, I highly recommend The Experiment; the interesting and engaging story is effectively complimented by brilliant performances from Brody and Whitaker. As of 11/24/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, although I also recommend a purchase.

The greatest part of this low budget movie are the actors involved. First is Adrian Brody who will make you believe everything is real and he is a man that stands up for what is right. Second, but never to be understated is Forest Whittiker (hopefully I didn't botch the spelling) who is a heavyweight, fantastic actor who plays a man that was always opressed in life, but now is given the power. The other actors in the cast are dynamite, very believable and do a fantastic job for a movie that is essentially men in a box.

Now there are rules to follow for the prison guards... if you don't follow the rules a red light goes on and no one gets their money. There is to be no violence at all. No prisoner may touch a guard. Prisoners must stay in designated areas. Prisoners must eat all food... no matter how nasty it is. So then what happens from there? An oops accidental basketball pass to a guard bangs him in the nose and lays him out. Was that an accident? Does someone need to be punnished? See here's where the talking points come in that you as an audience member can ponder. That is another thing that makes this movie so great. You as a watcher be the judge. It makes you think in good ways while sucking you in.

I'm sure you can guess what happens, but what holds this all together is the dynamic of Brody and Forest who both actually start out as aquaintainces that meet before the experiment when they enlist in it. They aren't bffs, but two men that met on the outside are torn apart and rise up to what they were meant to be, which are the two leaders of their groups. If it wasn't for how good the acting is this movie would be nothing special to watch.

This is worth everyone's time to watch at least once to ponder what would you do? What is right and what is wrong. It is worth a watch just to see two fantastic actors act without explosions, guns, car chases and so on.

It's about a group of people who get paid a large sum of money to pretend to be either prisoners or prison guards.  Which one it is depends on what the assignment paper says.  It turns out Adrien Brody's character becomes the innocent prisoner and Forest Whitaker's character becomes the power-hungry prison guard.

While the two sides are taking their respective role, video cameras from above are watching closely the actions of every person in the prison system.

That's basically all I really want to say about the storyline because revealing anything more would definitely spoil the movie for everyone.  Just know that there's several moments of power abuse that leads to humiliation, and one scene in particular involves urination and it's totally disgraceful.

The Experiment is probably best described as a spin on your typical prison-type storyline.  The storyline concerning a power struggle is obviously the aspect that stands out above everything else.  In all other areas however, this is exactly what you'd expect out of a good suspense- incredibly violent and action-packed, and the acting is really good throughout every single segment.

It's a quality film with a different take on an age old storyline that centers around a prison and the mistreatment of others.

Of the twenty-six applicants who passed the test (watching some video) and the interview, five men (including Whitaker's character Barris) are to play the ""guards"" while the remaining twenty-one (including Brody's character Travis) become the ""prisoners.""

Before the experiment begins, the participants are informed about the rules for the experiment. One important thing is that the ""prisoners"" must obey the ""guards,"" even in this mock prison. The experiment begins and soon confrontations arise, with some of the ""guards"" who take their roles very seriously.

This is supposed to be a psychological thriller, but not many actions of the characters are really convincing. The premise is interesting, but what ensues looks mostly contrived or predictable. One of the ""prisoners"" becomes sick; one ""guard"" turns out very sadistic; and so on. Acting of the leads is just OK, though overacting Forest Whitaker repeating ""Toilet!"" with grimace is unintentionally funny. Supporting players including Clifton Collins Jr. and Maggie Grace (as Travis' girlfriend) did decent jobs, though most of the characters they play are underwritten, even unnecessary.

""The Experiment,"" an American remake of a 2001 German thriller ""Das Experiment"" is, not surprisingly, directed by the ""Prison Break"" creator Paul Scheuring. As you know, the original German version directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel is inspired by Stanford Prison Experiment, which I believe did not end in this way.

Interestingly, for the remake Paul Scheuring has added a new idea to the original storyline: ""a red lamp"" that shows the termination of the experiment. I see the point the filmmakers are trying to make (obedience to the authorities, abuse of power, etc.), but the presence (or absence) of the red light in the film only lessens the credibility of the story, making the whole situation unbelievable.

With 'guilty pleasure' written all over it, ""The Experience"" is yet another unnecessary remake. It is watchable, but not as good as the original.",1315180800,3,2221,5.370689655172414
3078125,4,B00127IU9I,"Summary
 A hefty paycheck entices 26 men to partake in psychological prison experiment where participants will either play the role of a prisoner or a guard. What starts out as simple role playing in a fictitious world quickly evolves into a hellish real life scenario as the participants realize that they are entirely on their own. If that story line doesn't hook you, then this movie is definitely not for you.

What to expect
 So the movie is very pretty dark, and quite disturbing. It opens with a brilliant (but haunting) compilation of animalistic behaviour that's very hard to watch. There's one more combination of disturbing imagery (each subject is first tested to their psychological reaction to extreme violence - which is a video we the viewer also get to see. Those are the only two parts that will make your skin crawl, keeping in the mind that the rest of the movie still holds a depressing, disturbing and haunting atmosphere.

Why this movie is awesome
 The atmosphere. They absolutely nailed the dark atmosphere. Everything about this movie frustrates, and bothers it's viewer. From the irrational injustices that occur, to the indifference of the conductors as they director reminds you that every disturbing action is being watched through set up cameras. There is only minor character development, but this actually ends up being the perfect amount. Extraordinary behaviors of unique individuals are explained by the use of flashbacks of the eligibility interviews for the experiment. This was really a cool idea because the viewer is also unable to leave once the experiment has started (all stories prior to this, are introduced earlier, or dismissed).

 Personally, I love the examination of the human condition, so this style of experiment is incredible interesting to me; ordinary people put into an out of the ordinary situation. Even though the film has top notch acting, with a strong the story line, and ingenious directing, the movie loses it's 5 star rating because the experiment conducted in the movie is somewhat flawed. Instead of putting 26 level headed people into this experiment, they put a few abnormal people into the mix, and gave them the roles of guards. And unfortunately, the extreme circumstances of the movie are entirely caused by those who were unstable to begin with. What I would like to know is if all 26 participants were reasonable people, if the same results would inevitably carry out?

 Other then that though, it's a 5 star movie. Really well made, with everything from great dialogue to brilliant camera shots, huge kudos to the director, I just wish the experiment could have been played out with more balanced characters.",1309824000,,2686,5.031531531531532
3078126,5,B00127IU9I,movie came speedy.. not long.. and the movie was great.. a movie that shows what money and power can do to a person.. good action movie.. would recommend to anyone.,1306022400,,164,4.5
3078127,5,B00127IU9I,"The plot: a group of men, from various backgrounds, agree to participate in an 'experiment', for which they will be paid $14,000.  Some of the men are to act as prison guards, the rest as the prisoners.  They are to be 'observed' by the hosts of the experiment.

As the movie unfolds, you can identify with the feelings of both the guards and the prisoners.  Soon enough however, you are watching the complete deterioration of human behavior, even madness.  You may find this movie disturbing on many levels, yet you are compelled to keep watching.  Throughout the movie I felt nervous, anxious, and uneasy as I was drawn into the story.  By the end of the movie, my nerves were raw.  Adrien Brody gives an incredibly powerful performance as the 'ring leader' of the prisoners.  He is a man with a strong moral compass and a great deal of empathy for his fellow human beings.  But, by the end of the movie, he too succumbs to the madness of the experiment.  Forest Whitaker also gives a great performance as a mild-mannered, bible-reading individual, who is chosen as one of the guards.  He soon takes control of the other guards and convinces them that they can pretty much do whatever they want, assuring them that the experiment's 'hosts' will stop the experiment before anything dangerous can happen.

This movie may not be for everyone, but I thought it was extremely well done and will probably become a cult classic.  If you enjoy psychological dramas, you should watch this movie.",1305331200,,1488,4.717054263565892
3078128,2,B00127IU9I,"I watched the German original before seeing this remake, so my opinion is probably biased.  But regardless, I strongly felt that this movie falls very short of being as good as the original.  Where to begin?

First off: SPOILERS!

Starting with the opening credits, that lets me know exactly what I'm in for.  The credits start with showing animals fighting each other. Ok, it sets the mood for something disturbing and unsettling, plus implying the whole ""We're like animals"" theme.  This isn't a subtle movie, a lot of things from the opening credits to several of the last lines in the movie are going to state this.  It doesn't start out too blatant and obvious with its messaging, but trust me, it will become that way.

In the original movie our main character was a reporter turned taxi driver who still has connections with his news company.  When he gets a hold of the paper add for the experiment, he figures it's a good way to get a good story and plenty of money to boot to help him with his financial situation.  In this remake, Adrien Brody just plays an ex-psychiatrist who needs money, and discovers the add for the experiment sometime after an anti-war protest rally.  Already you can tell this movie is planning on being about as subtle as the opening credits.

Cue to everyone going into the large lecture hall where they are told what the experiment is, a recreation of a prison environment where half the participants will be guards (technically more prisoners than guards, 8-12).  This is where we meet another participant, Forrest Whitaker.  Has this guy ever played a subtle role in his life?  I'm not sure if he has or not, but every scene he's in you can tell he's probably just come from a looney bin, or was born emotionally unstable.  You would think that while conducting their psychological tests and evaluations on each of the participants they would figure out that this guy isn't suited for this experiment, but they decide to let him in anyway.  In the original movie, it seemed like ALL the participants were normal people.  In this movie, it lets you know right off the bat at least 1 of these guys is off their rockers before the test even begins.  First big flaw in the movie logic.

And wouldn't ya know it, all the people who seem somewhat emotionally unstable just by looking at them all become the guards.  So within the first 2 days, things start to get a little out of control.  Brody initiates a prison riot when he doesn't want to eat his crappy looking food, and eventually pays for it when the guards drag him from his cell and cuff him half naked to some other place in the open.  Whitaker apparently gets off on this stuff, so you can guess where his character evolves from there.  Soon the guards escalate in their harsh treatment and less fair ways (though to be fair the prisoners occasionally acted like asses too, but in a very mild way compared to how the guards escalate it in the last half of the movie), begin to lose their grip on reality (as do the prisoners), and things start to get out of control.

Then comes a twist in the movie where one of Brody's cell mates is revealed to be an ex-prisoner.  Are you s****ing me?  How could the organization running this thing not catch that?  You would think running a background check on these guys would be mandatory.  But nope, he manages to get in on it for the money.  In the original movie, the twist was the cell mate being a member of the air force here undercover to observe all that happens and report when it's all over, which is more believable.  Not so with the American remake.

There comes a breaking point where Whitaker whacks a guy on the head with a baton, thereby killing him, and that was when the experiment should have ended.  According to the guy who instructed all of them at the start of the experiment, if any violence is done, the experiment would be over.  Safety is their first concern.  Well, I'd say that would be a good time to let the red light blare and end the whole thing.  But nope, it still continues.  Once Brody gets locked in a cylinder of some sort in a claustrophobic pitch black environment, he notices a camera is in there with him, that the people who organized the experiment anticipated things to escalate this far, thus implying they were willing to let harm come to the participants.  This is where the biggest plot hole comes into the movie.  Just think for a minute.  Can you imagine the repercussions of something like this on the organization?  There would be some serious lawsuits at the very least, damage to the reputation, among other things.  In the original German movie, we saw things from the organization's perspective, to see their logic in escalating things, reasons why they didn't stop things when they should have, reasons that made sense.  In this movie, we don't see another sign of their existence once the experiment starts, just the fact that they're supposed to see everything through the cameras that are all over the complex.

In a nutshell, Brody breaks free, lets loose the other prisoners, and big riot begins that results in the guards getting a long waited beat down.  Then the red lights finally turn on, signaling the end of the experiment, resulting in the doors opening and for everyone to realize how foolish they had been ala Lord of the Flies.  You would think there would be a whole squad of cops waiting outside or something for them, but nope, nothing for another hour.  What does come is the same bus that they arrived on to take them away.  What BS.

So to summarize, see the original instead.  It's better paced, has better character development, and is more subtle in its themes, letting the viewers learn the themes themselves rather than having it directly told to them.  Speaking of character development, in the original, you not only saw the perspectives from the guards, prisoners, and organization, but also got to know most of the people from all sides very well, which is pretty good for a 2 hour movie, which was my first worry with the remake considering it nearly shaves off 30 minutes of that time.",1304899200,,6112,4.587096774193548
3078129,5,B00127IU9I,"The Standford Prison experiment conducted by Phil Zimbardo led to improvements in ethical standards in psychology experiments. However, what happens in this movie never happened in the real experiment. This goes to a whole new level and then some...I'm not going to spoil it, but there's definitely lessons in human behavior in this movie that while shocking, are real enough if something like this happened with test subjects like the ones used.

I thought...oh boring....A dramatized version of Phil's experiment....

To think anyone is immune from this type of behavior is a mistake, and the premise behind this movie (which I understand is based on a true experiment).

Forest Whitaker and Adrien Brody are both outstanding actors, and really give this film a lot of punch (the other actors aren't bad either).  The performances take this film over the top and give it a gritty reality, and a riveting, yet repulsive authenticity that can only be described as human nature.

However ""Das Experiment"" is based loosley on the ""Stamford Prison Experiment"" and a consequential reality show called ""The Experiment"" from BBC.

Basically the film is about a `what happens if `scenario. A group of people are selected from volunteers for an experiment which lasts for two weeks. The objective is to create a prison like environment in which there are two groups, the prisoners and the guards. Although there are rules but these rules are open to interpretation. The acting is great and both Brody and Whitaker are superb. Whitaker breathes life in to his role as the evil guard that at moments one wants to kill him. The film has a slightly weak ending but the editing and runtime save the movie and make it enjoyable. Three stars. 1/27/11",1296345600,,791,4.617021276595745
3078134,3,B00127IU9I,"This film is an intense portrayal of the human instinct to dominate and control. The opening images of animals and insects in conflict (rams butting heads, a praying mantis consuming a fly, even microorganisms devouring each other) signal the thematic connection to the conflict that plays out in this film--research subjects randomly assigned to roles as prisoners and guards and left to their own devices. The guards are given only a set of five rules they are instructed to enforce, and they are foolishly advised to avoid the use of violence. The devolution of order into chaos is reminiscent of ""The Lord of the Flies"" (and there's even a character who resembles the pathetic Piggy--and shares his unfortunate fate). But the film itself is a bit too facile and loose--there's a good deal of action but little in the way of character development, and the ending arrives violently and abruptly. Even the presence of two Best Actor Oscar winners, Brody and Whitaker, cannot rescue this film from its mediocrity.",1294531200,3,1013,5.0
3078135,5,B00127IU9I,"I picked up this movie at Red Box because I had read about the Stanford Prison experience and was curious to see it played out in a modern film.  It is very realistic and raw without being too much of a violence porn.  Great acting.

Got me to thinking. I don't think the experiment would play out the same if it were women.
Not that I think we're inherently good (I'm a woman),  just that we are wired differently when it comes to issues of power. I think that one of the subtle messages of the movie is about this very topic.  I think women are  needed in the lives of men to keep them from doing this to each other.  Just my two pennies.

Watch the movie. It's worth it. Form your own opinions.",1293926400,2,697,4.111111111111111
3078136,4,B00127IU9I,"""The Experiment"" is fundamentally a movie about power and the machinations of people. Quite often, the average individual believes he/she is altruistic and will always place the ideals and aspirations of society above their own. ""The Experiment"" is a mirror image of the human soul that suggests people may not be as magnanimous as they claim.

""The Experiment"" is based on the 1971 Stanford Prison Experiment by Dr. Philip Zimbardo (Read Zimbardo's book, ""The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil"").  In Zimbardo's experiment, he showed that people are rule-bound more then they realize. More importantly, when average individuals are given a modicum of power, they tend to usurp the rights and choices of others.  This idea goes farther then the movie.  Look at Bernard Madoff, The Financial and Housing Industry debacle and the latest politician caught in a scandal dealing with the public trust. You think you're better, ""The Experiment"" says you're not.

To adopt any concept dealing with human nature, whether it is becoming more magnetic, charismatic, or even diabolical, you have to study and understand human nature at its core.

Watch and study ""The Experiment"".  It might be one of the most entertaining, yet informative movies you will ever see.

First the actors (and I'm being liberal here with the term)- John Hopkins does a decent job with the material he's given, but Georgina French.  I've never seen her before, but she needs to find some other line of work.  She is rigid, totally unconvincing, and occasionally inappropriately comical.  This, while playing the role of a pseudo-zombie (now how hard can that be?).  Even her topless scene is unappetizing.  The plot- there are holes here big enough to accomodate the Titanic before the sinking.  A lost, amnestic housewife with martial arts training, knocking out embassy security staff & slicing the throat of bartenders, stumbling around outside in a stuppor, with no cop in sight?  Pseudo-zombies that have so little memory left they have a hard time reading, but no difficulty using a Palm-like device to navigate back to the lab? A complicated futuristic experiment carried out off of a pedestrian tunnel, without a lock on the door or guards anywhere? (but then we would have had to incorporate some sense in the script).  A frail old man shot twice but still able to stab & instantly kill his robust professional assailant with a 4 inch knife? (never mind he's still able to communicate afterwards).  Science fiction is one thing, nonsense another.  Blank eyes on everyone except the love subject, another pseudo-zombie?  All this effort to kill a government official on a public tour (gee, anyone on this production ever hear of an IED?)  What's the point anyway?

An experiment in the human psyche is conducted using a prison setting where one third of the participants are guards and two thirds are inmates.

Forrest Whitaker, a religious fellow who believes in absolute right and wrong becomes one of the guards. The two briefly talk and connect prior to the interview process.

While one of the rules was ""no violence"" the guards gradually test what constitutes violence. The red light becomes their ""God"" who ""approves"" of their action by inactivity.

3078146,5,B00127IU9I,"What would so-called normal people do if subjected to oppressive conditions, provided that they are well paid for it, and that their actions are safely supervised, as to avoid serious consequences? Well, that is precisely what some behaviorists have done in their research throughout history, sometimes for the good mankind, and sometimes for unsound reasons. ""The Experiment"" partially answers some of the many questions in regards to these matters, providing a shocking and unforgettable look at what can happen inside a prison if conditions get out of hand.

Travis (Adrien Brody) is an easy-going fellow who just lost his job at a retirement home. While looking for a new one, he finds an ad in a newspaper which says, ""Subjects wanted for behavioral experiment. Two weeks, no experience necessary. Safe. $1,000 / Day.""  This sounds like a really good opportunity to Travis, an offer he can't refuse. He is easily selected to participate in the experiment, and Dr. Archaleta (Fisher Stevens) informs the chosen group that they would be ""simulating the conditions of life inside a state penitentiary."" They are told, among other things, that some will not have civil rights, that no violence is allowed, and that not following directives will cause their immediate dismissal from the experiment. In addition, individuals who served time in prison are not allowed. Easy... Right?  After all, it is only two-weeks.

Travis becomes friends with Barris (Forest Whitaker) before going into confinement. However, once inside the prison, some men are assigned to be prisoners and others are selected to be guards. Travis becomes part of the prisoner group and Barris will be a guard; this would be a true test of their friendship. With time, we realize that among the chosen men, there is an ex-con, a diabetic, and a psychopath. As you can imagine, this is a potentially volatile mix that will definitely compromise the experiment, affecting the behavior of the participants. Add to this that nobody wants to loose the $1,000 bucks per day that they were promised. In the end, one participant asks another, ""You still think we are higher in the evolutionary chain and monkeys?"" You'll have to figure out that one for yourself.

""The Experiment"" provides food for thought and great entertainment. You will place yourself in the position of the experiment's participants, and would ask yourself what you would do in any given circumstance. A warning, though: This film is a remake of the German film with the same title (Das Experiment, 2001), and is based on the novel ""Black Box,"" by Mario Giordano. I recommend that you see this movie without reading the book or watching the 2001 version, as it will affect your judgment of the film. (USA, 2010, color, 96 min).

Brody and Whittaker are both good, but the script is predictable and the direction is weak. There is so much room for character detail and subtlety here, but we get almost none of that; almost every character is left barely fleshed out, and it all adds up to a could-have-been-much-better feel.

3078148,5,B00127IU9I,"""The Experiment"" is a movie of tension and the exploitation of the animal instinct within the human behavioral code. Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker, among a top-grade supporting cast, are two guys who, for their own separate reasons, decide to take a two-week job as either a prisoner or a guard (they don't know which until they get there) at an isolated facility made to resemble a prison where they will be monitored intently by video cameras placed strategically throughout the place. There are some rules that are applied to both prisoner and guard, and these rules only add to the creation of tense and over-the-top situations.

Be warned, there are a lot of uncomfortable moments, some blood, and Adrien has to perform a few things as an actor that I would have difficulty doing on or off the camera...as I'm sure almost anyone would.

There were a couple of question marks here, like who was making the food and cleaning the eating areas, but other than that, any potential holes in the plot were filled very cleanly and deftly.

The mixture of good story, high tension, and great actors make this little surprise of a movie one to put high on your list of flicks to watch in the near future! This should have deservedly received marketing and ample time in the theaters; it was that good! If this kind of thing (psychological thriller) is your bag, you MUST check it out!",1285286400,,1382,4.679012345679013
3078149,2,B00127IU9I,"In 1971, one of the most well-known and controversial psychological experiment's in the United States was conducted by Stanford University Professor Dr. Philip Zimbardo.  The experiment was known as the Stanford prison experiment and 24 undergraduate students participated in mock experiment in which they would play the role of guards and prisoners.  The goal was to promote disorientation, depersonalisation and deindivisualisation.

The students playing the guards adapted to their role rather quickly and ended up humiliating, hurting and causing emotional and physical trauma to the students playing the prisoners and Dr. Zimbardo played a passive role and being a scientist and not stopping the experiment until the woman he was dating confronted him for passively allowing unethical acts to be performed under his direct supervision.

The experiment lasted only six days and after the study was completed, the Dr. submitted his findings to the U.S. House Committee on Judiciary.

Because of his experiment, the findings were quite important but also highly debated.  What made the students playing the guards become abusive and oppressive?  Was it because there were no clear instructions?  Were the guards playing a part of what they felt should be the role of a guard?  And this was within six days of the experiment that all hell broke loose.

This experiment was covered in the novel ""Black Box"" by Mario Giordano and the novel would receive a 2001 German adaptation titled ""Das Experiment"".  The film is similar to 1971 the real Stanford Prison Experiment but in this case, the scientists play a passive role in observation of the inhuman and the guards not only become power hungry and oppressive to the prisoners but they go even further by killing.

In 2010, the American remake titled ""The Experiment"" which is not necessarily a remake of the German hit film ""Das Experiment"" but inspired by the film and the Stanford Prison Experiment and is directed by ""Prison Break"" TV show writer Paul Scheuring (who also wrote the screenplay adaptation) and a film that will be direct-to-video starring Oscar winners Adrien Brody (""King Kong"", ""The Darjeeling Limited"", ""The Brothers Bloom"", ""Predators"") and Forest Whitaker (""Criminal Minds"", ""Vantage Point"", ""The Shield"", ""The Last King of Scotland"").

""The Experiment"" revolves around 26 men who participate in a psychological study in which they can earn $14,000 if they continue to play the role of the prisoner and the guards for two weeks.  The study is done by Dr. Archaleta (played by Fisher Stevens) who is trying to examine how aggressive behavior is played out in an artificial prison setting.

VIDEO:

""The Experiment"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1) and the picture quality is wonderful.  You can see the detail in the skin of the faces of people, the stubble, the tattoos and anguish on the faces of the characters being oppressed.  The majority of the film is shot indoors but you do see vibrant colors more during Travis' dreams as he imagines Bay in India and we see the colors of the reds really pop.  But for the most part, the majority of the film is shot in a dreary prison set.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Experiment"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and although the majority of the film is dialogue-driven, there are some scenes in which we can hear the prisoners screaming at the guards to people getting beaten up and hit.  Even one scene with a piercing high noise when Travis is apprehended and about to be choked by one of the guards.  Overall, the film presents crisp, clear dialogue and music by Graeme Revell (""Pineapple Express"", ""Days of Wrath"", ""Eleventh Hour"", ""The Forgotten"").

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Unfortunately, ""The Experiment"" comes with no special features but does have BD-Live capability for those who want to register their Blu-ray for Sony Pictures Home Entertainment points or download trailers.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The Experiment"" is a riveting film featuring a wonderful performance by Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker.  Forest Whitaker really does a great job of playing the bible-reading, calm and collected Baris who then changes and becomes this abusive and power hungry man.

Both men do carry this film as the performances are needed because unlike ""Das Experiment"" or even the original true experiment that the film is inspired on, director and screenwriter Paul Scheuring unfortunately chooses to focus more on the inhumane practice of the guards as we see them not only become oppressive but also rapist, murders and for the most part, seeing good people turning bad.

We know that this was the case in the original Stanford Prison Experiment in 1971 and the film does a great job showing that.  The problem is that they take the doctor and scientists out of the equation.

With the real Stanford story, we know about the Dr. and him playing a passive role until he is confronted by his date who has ethical concerns in regards to his experiment and then seeing how he lost control over his own experiment and things gone awry.  In ""Das Experiment"", we see how the guards become oppressive but Dr. and scientist in this film have an integral role in which everything plays out in the end.

In ""The Experiment"", we see Dr. Archaleta briefly in the film.  His job is to study the participants who will be playing the police and prisoners but the storyline goes nowhere with it, especially around the character Dr. Archaleta.  Why would this man allow one to be suffering from diabetes and having him grow sick?  Why would the Dr. allow such brutality to happen.  Yes, it happened in the Stanford test and ""Das Experiment"" but there are scientists that have their own reasoning and in this case, it was getting out of hand that murder, rape and other inhumane things were taking place and yet, no one stopped it.

The whole chilling experiment was covered well in the film but I felt the storyline was not well-conceived, felt a bit rushed and the ending was not at all satisfying.  ""Das Experiment"" shows the repercussions towards the scientists who have let this experiment grow chaotic, inhumane and deadly and allows the viewer to put a face to the people behind the experiment.  With ""The Experiment"",  I was not satisfied how they chose to end the film and it was simply a lazy way to end the film and destroyed any potential of the film to achieve a thrilling ending like ""Das Experiment"".

The Blu-ray release does sport very good picture quality and the dialogue is clear and understandable but for a newer film, was shocked that there were no special features at all.  It would have been wonderful for director/screenwriter Paul Scheuring to explain his thoughts on the making of the film especially the ending via an audio commentary but unfortunately, we are not giving anything extra for the film.  No interviews, no featurettes...nothing.

Overall, ""The Experiment"" had so much potential, especially if it was inspired from ""Das Experiment"".  Even if they did a straight copy of the German film in English, viewers would have enjoyed a thrilling ending and a much more understandable plot.  But unfortunately, despite the wonderful performance by Adrian Brody and Forest Whitaker and also the thrilling scenes that involve both men, the film just doesn't give the viewer any satisfying closure  and the Blu-ray release has no special features at all.  So, much potential for this film but unfortunately, this release is best as a rental and not a keeper.",1285286400,12,7495,4.975922953451043
3078150,5,B00127IU9I,"When looking up the new releases here on Amazon, seeing this movie NOT on the few movies listed on the main page was a real mistake in my opinion. I even went to 3 stores looking for this movie and the first 2 had no idea what movie I was requesting and didn't even have it on release day! I saw a trailer for it a few months ago and immediately knew I had to have it.
The basic story is: Volunteers will be paid for an experiment where they are put into a simulated prison experience. Stressfull challenges are then introduced throughout the experiment. If any physical attacks are observed between the guards and prisoners, the experiment will end and no one gets paid. We meet Adrian Brody and Forest Whitaker introducing themselves to one another prior to the experiment and we see that these are 2 very different people but there is a mutual respect forming. We then find out, some volunteers will be guards and some will be prisoners.
Amazing performances by Adrien Brody, Forest Whitaker, Clifton Collins Jr. and many more supporting roles, will have you sitting on the edge of your seat through the whole movie. It is clear, at the beginning, some volunteers  are going to be trouble and as the movie moves along, power does corrupt even the best of the men but we feel for them because they are told, ""you will not get paid if you do not follow and enforce the rules.""
I do NOT agree with Amazon's review that this movie ""never quite grabs hold"". By the end of the movie, I was almost in tears after watching men who respected each other at the beginning, couldn't even look each other in the eye by the end. There isn't much more to say. The synopsis of the movie pretty much tells you what it is about.

3078152,4,B00127IU9I,"The Experiment was quite entertaining from start to finish.
It was very satisfying in story ,acting and conclusion. The experiment is where men are paid 1000 dollars a day to supposedly Simulate either a Prisoner or a guard in a maximum security setting,no one knows which they will be until they enter the facility..

Adrien Brody is an uber hottie in my opinion and a great actor he plays an anti violence anti war advocate,but just how long and how much can he take before he changes his way of thinking to an eye for an eye? The stand out was Forest Whitaker as a man given authority as a guard in a make believe world, but in actuality he's s 42 year old man living with his coddling,emasculating mother. He see's this as a way to get back at her by being cruel to those put in a weaker position because he feels weak in her presence. In one shocking scene he pops a woody just after handcuffing and humiliating Brody's character.

Cam Gigandet is evil as another faux guard who in his characters real life lives for sex, drugs and sleep..
He takes a shine to an effeminate faux prisoner and does some very evil things to him..This movie is quite brutal and hard to watch at times,some of the acts that are put upon Brody especially are very humiliating and would be hard for any man to take..
a favorite actor of mine,the much under rated Clifton Collins Jr plays another faux prisoner and tough guy in typical Collins style to the hilt .The climax is a shocking and impactful. All in all a really good film. I would buy it and watch it again.",1285027200,32,1549,4.375

The Experiment is a sad reminder that humans aren't that evolved.  We still carry tendencies of following the herd and going along with the alpha male even though we know what is morally and ethically right or wrong.

Given a set of parameters or rules to follow in order to achieve a monetary gain, we lose humanity and succumb to greed, ego and lack of compassion.  This is a powerful movie and it is a story that is reminiscent of Lord of the Flies except we're dealing with adults.  There are some graphic scenes and you really feel emotional if you get into this movie.

3312502,3,B00127IU9I,"Experiment (Dan Turner, 2005)

Here's an interesting little flick that could have been really good, a kind of update of The Manchurian Candidate with a much smaller milieu and a cool sci-fi twist, but it loses its way just a few too many times.

Anna (Georgina French in her first film role) wakes up in the middle of the road in what seems to be a nameless Eastern European country (we find out later it's Chechnya), having been dumped out of a van in the opening scene. We soon find out that she is unable to speak, nor to remember anything. Meanwhile, Morgan (John Hopkins, no doubt soon to be a household name; he's in Tim Burton's upcoming Alice in Wonderland) also wakes up with no memory, but he finds that he has been taken in by a seemingly benevolent old man named Joseph (Bird Feeder's Nick Simons). Joseph discovers a picture Morgan has on him, and written on the back in marker is ""MORGAN FIND ANNA."" But with no memory, how is he going to do so? And what happened to his memory in the first place?

It's not half bad, really, though some of the acting could have been better (and in at least one case, a whole lot better), and the script keeps teetering on the brink of being too complex for Turner (Big Mistake) to handle. This was his first film, though, and given the amount of potential it had, I'm kind of willing to give him a pass on it. Not at all what it could have been, but intriguing nonetheless, and worth checking out. ** ",1251331200,,1450,4.339483394833948

3312559,2,B00127IU9I,"The ""Experiment""(2005) is directed by Dan Turner. This film starts off quite poorly, with poor scripting, and mediocre acting, but does pull itself together about half way through to at least qualify as an average effort. The best thing about this film though was the haunting cover. The idea itself, about two people who have lost their memories after being experimented on and then released into the urban environment so as to act as assassins of government officials, also isn't terribly original, and is scripted in a way that isn't very inspired or dramatically convincing though it does have a okay semi-surprise ending. Just barely entertaining.

3312593,3,B00127IU9I,"The Experiment (Paul T. Scheuring, 2010)

As is almost always the case, there is a lot of hooting and hollering on the internet about how The Experiment is yet another crappy American remake of a movie that is much, much better. And in many ways, I tacitly agree with it; Olivier Hirschbiegel's 2001 film Das Experiment got four stars from me and is pretty high up in my Top 1000, while this remake gets two and a half stars. But I feel I kind of need to defend this movie from some of the aggressors, because the arguments I'm seeing...don't make a lot of sense when you compare the two films. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

Plot: The Experiment's title makes a good deal more sense to students of recent history when you put the words Stanford prison in between them. Twenty-six men are chosen from a pool of applicants. They are divided into guards (nine) and prisoners (seventeen) and put into a small, self-contained world meant to resemble a prison...and then the watchers sit back and see how long it takes these people, who were for all intents and purposes equals on the outside, to fall into their roles, with all that conveys. The two groups shake out pretty quickly into their natural orders, with pacifist Travis (Oxygen's Adrian Brody) becoming the de facto leader of the prisoners, and meek office worker Barris (Panic Room's Forest Whitaker) finding himself in the odd position of being the leader of the guards. You know where this is going, but there are other interesting/dramatic/amusing side stories being played out as well.

CAUTION: The next paragraph contains spoilers for Hirschbiegel's movie. Be warned.

The main argument I keep hearing about how much better the 2001 film is in comparison to this one is that it's closer to what really happened. I'm sorry, folks, but that's sheer, unadulterated bull[censored for Amazon consumption]. Do you really think that daring escape in the climax of the 2001 movie happened that way? (Christina Maslach, upon whom Franka Potente's character was based, did object to the experiment, and it was her intervention that got the experiment shut down, but she did not help bust the prisoners out.) Based on a true story means exactly that, and the folks who are writing the screenplays are going to change details for dramatic tension. And, given that a decade elapsed between the two films and that they were made in two different cultures, the details the scriptwriters change are going to be different. The particular hidden side we end up seeing to Chase (Easy A's Cam Gigandet) was added because that's a part of the American public consciousness/primal fear; the screenwriters in Germany might not have even had it cross their minds, because it's not the huge bugaboo in Europe that it is an America. If you're going to complain about a movie for working strains of tension inherent to its culture, that's not a problem with the movie.

That said, where the movie went was kind of predictable, and in ways I wish it hadn't been. It makes sense in the scope of the film for Scheuring's screenplay to have most of the prisoners be shallow stereotypes, but that doesn't make them any more satisfying (and it also tips his hand as to one character who becomes an unwitting catalyst to the events in the final quarter of the film; it's an ambitious play, but because of the way Scheuring structured his characters, it doesn't have the impact it could have). And, well, the climax, which has taken so much heat...it's obviously drawing from Hirschbiegel rather than actual events, but where Hirschbiegel threw in a curve ball or two (the major one is alluded to above), Scheuring went with the most logical probable outcome, after throwing in one character revelation that made not one damn bit of sense (nor of difference, when it came right down to it), and robbed much of what should have been a fist-pumping satisfactory climax of its rah-rah-rah-ness. (That said, he does set up the denouement, which is quite the depressing anticlimax, and in many ways it's the most effective part of the movie.)

I wanted this to be a better movie than it is. But with that said, I rather liked it; any chance Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker get to flex their onscreen muscles is probably going to be worth at least a watch, and neither disappoints here. Worth checking out if you stumble upon it at Netflix. ** ",1399680000,,4370,4.764861294583884

The movie beats you over the head with the power trip of the guards. They spend most of the 90 minute film testing how terrible they can be to the prisoners. They are limited only by the rules of the experiment (and they have to abide for their cash reward). Soon though the rules disappear from the film's focus and its all about how psychotic a few of the guards are. 'The Rules' are supposed to protect the subjects and govern the experiment, with a red-light bulb to symbolize their code. This stupid red bulb does not go off until after these acts: violence, pissing on prisoners, attempted rape, more violence, and murder.

The movie wraps up quickly, thank god, with an unbelievable ending where they all ride home together. Such a waste of talented actors.",1397347200,2,1042,4.537234042553192

3312602,4,B00127IU9I,"The movie is based on the psychological experiment done at Standford University Prison in 1971. Twenty-six participants were selected randomly for the experiment. Six were made prison guards, and the rest inmates. For two weeks they had to follow the strict rules set by the experimenter - prisoners to obey the rules and guards to enforce. At the end of two weeks, each one will be paid $14,000. However, if rules were broken, or any participant wanted to quit, or any kind of violence occurred, the experiment would be terminated with red light and siren, and everyone will forfeit their contract money.

As the experiment proceeds, within few days big disparity starts to occur between guards and prisoners. Pride and ego emerge to dominate and so the animosity. Quickly both camps forget the experiment and things become real and surreal. Participants take the roles too seriously and over enthusiastically. The guards starts giving psychological torture to the prisoners especially to whom they consider as leaders and dissidents, mainly to one prisoner named Travis (Adrein Brody). On the other hand, one of the guards Barris (Forest Whitaker) turns into totalitarian dictator and sadistic madman. As the guards become more cruel and authoritarian, prisoners become more defiant. We know instinctively where this going to lead ultimately. The situation goes from bizarre to violent as time goes by, and get shockingly bad towards end. I had my hair standing on my back, emotionally draining. It just got crazier and crazier at the end. I felt very uncomfortable at the last half an hour, and could even feel extreme anger building inside me towards the guards and their extreme behavior. I was literally shaking (I also forgot for a while that I was just watching a movie!).

Finally, in day 7, violent war loose break between guards and inmates, and the experiment comes to an abrupt end. The story shows how people transform themselves after becoming authority figures and start abusing the power (Take note supporters of despotic government!). A very shocking movie indeed! A good lesson to learn, but not an easy movie to watch. This is not a movie for soft-hearted or very young. Please be ready to get thrilled and shocked more than entertained. May be disturbing movie for some. I had never seen a movie like this before for its emotional shock value. I must give at least 4 out of 5 for the way realistically story is portrayed and for the thriller. Total running time is about 96 minutes. Good movie to watch if you like psychological experiments.",1374624000,,2562,4.96969696969697

3312604,3,B00127IU9I,"I picked up this movie from a Blockbuster store that was going under for a whole $2 on Blu Ray. Honestly, I didn't even know Adrien Brody was in it, but when I saw that he was, that's when I really gave the movie a try. I loved him in The Pianist and in The Jacket. As the movie got underway, I then saw that Forest Whitaker was in the movie as well. It was then that I felt the movie really had some legs to stand on so I was a little excited.

I was let down.

The performances by Brody and Whitaker are quite good. Brody plays the role of a peaceful, everyday Joe who answers an ad for a controlled experiment with the promised pay day of $14k. Once there, he meets Whitaker's character who is presented to us as a devout Christian. After some prescreening, both of them, along with several others, are selected to take part in the experiment. Once they arrive at the facility, it is explained to them that they will all be divided into 2 groups: one will be prisoners and the others will be guards. There are a few rules given to the guards as soon as they are getting dressed to start the experiment. Whitaker's character is selected to play a guard while Brody's is to play a prisoner.

******SPOILERS AHEAD! STOP READING IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW SPECIFIC DETAILS!******

The concept is laid out cut and dry for us and you can almost immediately tell where this is headed. Still, you find yourself wanting to watch. As the movie progresses though, there is a major plot hole that, in itself, almost does the movie in. A character by the name of Benjy is selected as a prisoner. It is later revealed that Benjy is diabetic. He lies on his application for the project by saying that he controls it with diet when he actually has to take insulin injections. On day two of the experiment, he asks for something to help with his blood sugar levels which are getting low. In most cases, a diabetic with low blood sugar could simply have a decent meal and be just fine. However, instead of simply giving him food, the guards ignore his request and leave him in his weakened state. Being from a family of people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, I can assure you if Benjy had not gotten something to eat, he would have been in very serious danger of going into a diabetic coma. From the signs he was displaying, it looked as if he was in dire need of something to eat. Yet, he supposedly goes another full day without eating. He is simply shown laying down in his cell the entire time while the rest of the prisoners go off and have their three meals. Not eating for an entire day can be tough on the average person, but for a diabetic it might as well be a death sentence. Any person with diabetes would have surely succumbed and, at the very least, gone into a coma. Some would have probably died. Later in the film, Benjy ends up getting the insulin he brought with him, but was not allowed to take into the experiment. Having not eaten for an extended period of time, no diabetic would then take insulin as it is used to keep blood sugar levels low. Only if Benjy had been eating should he have taken his insulin. Adrien Brody's character is seen later bringing Benjy a single piece of bread which is not nearly enough for a diabetic to survive on. It is this glaring oversight that, for me, discredits the film as far a believability.

Another issue, although smaller, is the set itself. All the participants are supposedly housed in a brick building. During the climax of the film, several prisoners are seen running through a hallway and as they push their hands up against a brick wall, you can actually see the wall wobble. I know you have to suspend disbelief when you watch a film, but the mistakes were so obvious they were hard to ignore.

Some of the violence feels very contrived. One of the first disagreements between the guards and the prisoners happens when a prisoner accidentally hits a guard in the face with a basketball. Apologies are given immediately. As a way to punish the prisoner for this, he is asked to do 10 pushups. While the prisoner is a little older, ten pushups seems reasonable and actually very light as far as punishment...yet, he still refuses to do it. From there and through the rest of the movie, the punishments escalate.

Brody and Whitaker do turn in very good performances which is why I granted the film the rating that I did. Without their star power and talent, the film is pretty much a throwaway. Clifton Collins, Jr, while not as big a star as Brody and Whitaker, did play the role of a member of the Aryan Brotherhood very well and his performance should also be seen as a bright spot.

The rest of the performances felt weak to me. I just couldn't buy some of the others guys in the movie at all. I don't know if it was their performance or if Brody and Whitaker simply outshined them to the point where they came across as first time actors.

The transfer to Blu Ray was quite good. The sound quality was there and the picture was clear and crisp on my 48"" HD television. The coloring in certain scenes just shined. I wish more films were transferred as well as this one was.

Overall, I can see why the film was a direct to video movie. It really is a shame though. Given the two leads, you'd think they would have had someone fact check more on the writing side. It's not often you get two men who both won Academy Awards into a film together. While some might find the film good, I have to say that it is average at best and the only reason to give it a look is because of the performances turned in by its two stars.

3312606,4,B00127IU9I,"Looking at just the plot, this movie is fairly average.  A sensational interpretation of the Stanford Prison Experiment?  Some pretty cheesy dialogue? A splash of gay panic?  All check. But look at that cast...

Forrest Whitaker has the standout performance here.  Take his character from Ghost Dog and replace the glorified samurai ethic with a suppressed semi-sexual desire for dominance, and you have a good starting point for his character here.  A quiet, seemingly good-natured creepiness exudes from him that you rarely see outside public transportation.

Adrien Brody, of course, is a great actor.  I've yet to see anything he's acted poorly in.  He gets some boring lines in this movie, but he acts them damn well.

And a few bonus points to Fisher Stevens for doing his best 70's Zimbardo impersonation.  Really, both do a really good job of conveying a scientist that has possibly gone a bit nuts.

And don't forget the jerk from Easy A, and the bad guy from Crank: High Voltage, and wasn't that guy in Black Snake Moan?  Really, the rest of the cast is just kind of there, but Whitaker and Brody carry a lot of this movie.

3312607,4,B00127IU9I,"Honestly, the movie does not reveal anything new--that we all have animal instinct, and both Jungian school of psychology and traditional school of thinkers have already hammered that point. There is a reason we use, in our vernacular ""The Angel"" and ""The Devil"" in us. It shows, how, given enough stimulus,our demon self can reign supreme over our concept of self. From a conceptual standpoint, there is nothing new here. As physical animals, our physical preservation is linked with our psychological sense of self and vice versa. So, threat to one triggers conjugal reaction for self-preservation. What is so new about it? The movie has one fatal flaw, and that is about technical aspect of it.
(1) The red light was supposed to go on whenever violence takes place. But it seems that the researchers awaited a death and till the end to do so. It does not ""commensurate"" with the premise of the movie, since to the end, the director still wants us to believe it was an experiment, just got a bit extreme.
(2) The system set up was such that there was a binding condition to get a certain amount of cash, but the table of power could have been altered easily, since one group outnumbers the other.
 So, I think the movie was in reality a weak one. But it passes as a yet a decent art work, due to the intense scenes and a sense of optimism.
 Those who have never accepted the fact that they carry a demon within, the shadow self, are naive; and those who submit to the demon and fail to promote the angel within to march with the demon with necessary solidarity are immature and need grow up further.
 The concept of the show is unique. I stand by my rating though, that it is a 3 to 3.5 star movie.",1354233600,,1700,4.459807073954984

They arrive in a facility and are split into two groups; 6 will act as guards and 20 will act as prisoners in a prison simulation. What we get as the audience is one stunning experiment worth watching.

Adrien Brody plays Travis, the leader-like figure for the prisoners, and Forest Whitaker plays Barris, the leader-like figure for the guards. Brody and Whitaker are both spectacular in their roles, and especially liked Whitaker's power hungry roles. The story moves at a very fast pace and focuses on the problems with violence (in life and prison) and emphasizes the change that we can implement as humans; however, it does not preach. It works mostly off of its engaging dialogue and arguements and some violent, disturbing scenes of discipline. The ending was great, as well.

Overall, I highly recommend The Experiment; the interesting and engaging story is effectively complimented by brilliant performances from Brody and Whitaker. As of 11/24/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, although I also recommend a purchase.

The greatest part of this low budget movie are the actors involved. First is Adrian Brody who will make you believe everything is real and he is a man that stands up for what is right. Second, but never to be understated is Forest Whittiker (hopefully I didn't botch the spelling) who is a heavyweight, fantastic actor who plays a man that was always opressed in life, but now is given the power. The other actors in the cast are dynamite, very believable and do a fantastic job for a movie that is essentially men in a box.

Now there are rules to follow for the prison guards... if you don't follow the rules a red light goes on and no one gets their money. There is to be no violence at all. No prisoner may touch a guard. Prisoners must stay in designated areas. Prisoners must eat all food... no matter how nasty it is. So then what happens from there? An oops accidental basketball pass to a guard bangs him in the nose and lays him out. Was that an accident? Does someone need to be punnished? See here's where the talking points come in that you as an audience member can ponder. That is another thing that makes this movie so great. You as a watcher be the judge. It makes you think in good ways while sucking you in.

I'm sure you can guess what happens, but what holds this all together is the dynamic of Brody and Forest who both actually start out as aquaintainces that meet before the experiment when they enlist in it. They aren't bffs, but two men that met on the outside are torn apart and rise up to what they were meant to be, which are the two leaders of their groups. If it wasn't for how good the acting is this movie would be nothing special to watch.

This is worth everyone's time to watch at least once to ponder what would you do? What is right and what is wrong. It is worth a watch just to see two fantastic actors act without explosions, guns, car chases and so on. It proves their acting might to stick them in a low budget box (jail) and watch what happens.",1332633600,,2274,4.222988505747127

It's about a group of people who get paid a large sum of money to pretend to be either prisoners or prison guards.  Which one it is depends on what the assignment paper says.  It turns out Adrien Brody's character becomes the innocent prisoner and Forest Whitaker's character becomes the power-hungry prison guard.

While the two sides are taking their respective role, video cameras from above are watching closely the actions of every person in the prison system.

That's basically all I really want to say about the storyline because revealing anything more would definitely spoil the movie for everyone.  Just know that there's several moments of power abuse that leads to humiliation, and one scene in particular involves urination and it's totally disgraceful.

The Experiment is probably best described as a spin on your typical prison-type storyline.  The storyline concerning a power struggle is obviously the aspect that stands out above everything else.  In all other areas however, this is exactly what you'd expect out of a good suspense- incredibly violent and action-packed, and the acting is really good throughout every single segment.

It's a quality film with a different take on an age old storyline that centers around a prison and the mistreatment of others.

3312621,3,B00127IU9I,"Two Oscar winners Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker are in this suspense movie about the ""experiment,"" in which ordinary people selected by some ""researchers"" have to live in a small mock prison for two weeks. Of the twenty-six applicants who passed the test (watching some video) and the interview, five men (including Whitaker's character Barris) are to play the ""guards"" while the remaining twenty-one (including Brody's character Travis) become the ""prisoners.""

Before the experiment begins, the participants are informed about the rules for the experiment. One important thing is that the ""prisoners"" must obey the ""guards,"" even in this mock prison. The experiment begins and soon confrontations arise, with some of the ""guards"" who take their roles very seriously.

This is supposed to be a psychological thriller, but not many actions of the characters are really convincing. The premise is interesting, but what ensues looks mostly contrived or predictable. One of the ""prisoners"" becomes sick; one ""guard"" turns out very sadistic; and so on. Acting of the leads is just OK, though overacting Forest Whitaker repeating ""Toilet!"" with grimace is unintentionally funny. Supporting players including Clifton Collins Jr. and Maggie Grace (as Travis' girlfriend) did decent jobs, though most of the characters they play are underwritten, even unnecessary.

""The Experiment,"" an American remake of a 2001 German thriller ""Das Experiment"" is, not surprisingly, directed by the ""Prison Break"" creator Paul Scheuring. As you know, the original German version directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel is inspired by Stanford Prison Experiment, which I believe did not end in this way.

Interestingly, for the remake Paul Scheuring has added a new idea to the original storyline: ""a red lamp"" that shows the termination of the experiment. I see the point the filmmakers are trying to make (obedience to the authorities, abuse of power, etc.), but the presence (or absence) of the red light in the film only lessens the credibility of the story, making the whole situation unbelievable.

With 'guilty pleasure' written all over it, ""The Experience"" is yet another unnecessary remake. It is watchable, but not as good as the original.",1315180800,3,2221,5.370689655172414
3312622,4,B00127IU9I,"Summary
 A hefty paycheck entices 26 men to partake in psychological prison experiment where participants will either play the role of a prisoner or a guard. What starts out as simple role playing in a fictitious world quickly evolves into a hellish real life scenario as the participants realize that they are entirely on their own. If that story line doesn't hook you, then this movie is definitely not for you.

What to expect
 So the movie is very pretty dark, and quite disturbing. It opens with a brilliant (but haunting) compilation of animalistic behaviour that's very hard to watch. There's one more combination of disturbing imagery (each subject is first tested to their psychological reaction to extreme violence - which is a video we the viewer also get to see. Those are the only two parts that will make your skin crawl, keeping in the mind that the rest of the movie still holds a depressing, disturbing and haunting atmosphere.

Why this movie is awesome
 The atmosphere. They absolutely nailed the dark atmosphere. Everything about this movie frustrates, and bothers it's viewer. From the irrational injustices that occur, to the indifference of the conductors as they director reminds you that every disturbing action is being watched through set up cameras. There is only minor character development, but this actually ends up being the perfect amount. Extraordinary behaviors of unique individuals are explained by the use of flashbacks of the eligibility interviews for the experiment. This was really a cool idea because the viewer is also unable to leave once the experiment has started (all stories prior to this, are introduced earlier, or dismissed).

 Personally, I love the examination of the human condition, so this style of experiment is incredible interesting to me; ordinary people put into an out of the ordinary situation. Even though the film has top notch acting, with a strong the story line, and ingenious directing, the movie loses it's 5 star rating because the experiment conducted in the movie is somewhat flawed. Instead of putting 26 level headed people into this experiment, they put a few abnormal people into the mix, and gave them the roles of guards. And unfortunately, the extreme circumstances of the movie are entirely caused by those who were unstable to begin with. What I would like to know is if all 26 participants were reasonable people, if the same results would inevitably carry out?

 Other then that though, it's a 5 star movie. Really well made, with everything from great dialogue to brilliant camera shots, huge kudos to the director, I just wish the experiment could have been played out with more balanced characters.",1309824000,,2686,5.031531531531532

3312624,5,B00127IU9I,"The plot: a group of men, from various backgrounds, agree to participate in an 'experiment', for which they will be paid $14,000.  Some of the men are to act as prison guards, the rest as the prisoners.  They are to be 'observed' by the hosts of the experiment.

As the movie unfolds, you can identify with the feelings of both the guards and the prisoners.  Soon enough however, you are watching the complete deterioration of human behavior, even madness.  You may find this movie disturbing on many levels, yet you are compelled to keep watching.  Throughout the movie I felt nervous, anxious, and uneasy as I was drawn into the story.  By the end of the movie, my nerves were raw.  Adrien Brody gives an incredibly powerful performance as the 'ring leader' of the prisoners.  He is a man with a strong moral compass and a great deal of empathy for his fellow human beings.  But, by the end of the movie, he too succumbs to the madness of the experiment.  Forest Whitaker also gives a great performance as a mild-mannered, bible-reading individual, who is chosen as one of the guards.  He soon takes control of the other guards and convinces them that they can pretty much do whatever they want, assuring them that the experiment's 'hosts' will stop the experiment before anything dangerous can happen.

This movie may not be for everyone, but I thought it was extremely well done and will probably become a cult classic.  If you enjoy psychological dramas, you should watch this movie.",1305331200,,1488,4.717054263565892
3312625,2,B00127IU9I,"I watched the German original before seeing this remake, so my opinion is probably biased.  But regardless, I strongly felt that this movie falls very short of being as good as the original.  Where to begin?

First off: SPOILERS!

Starting with the opening credits, that lets me know exactly what I'm in for.  The credits start with showing animals fighting each other. Ok, it sets the mood for something disturbing and unsettling, plus implying the whole ""We're like animals"" theme.  This isn't a subtle movie, a lot of things from the opening credits to several of the last lines in the movie are going to state this.  It doesn't start out too blatant and obvious with its messaging, but trust me, it will become that way.

In the original movie our main character was a reporter turned taxi driver who still has connections with his news company.  When he gets a hold of the paper add for the experiment, he figures it's a good way to get a good story and plenty of money to boot to help him with his financial situation.  In this remake, Adrien Brody just plays an ex-psychiatrist who needs money, and discovers the add for the experiment sometime after an anti-war protest rally.  Already you can tell this movie is planning on being about as subtle as the opening credits.

Cue to everyone going into the large lecture hall where they are told what the experiment is, a recreation of a prison environment where half the participants will be guards (technically more prisoners than guards, 8-12).  This is where we meet another participant, Forrest Whitaker.  Has this guy ever played a subtle role in his life?  I'm not sure if he has or not, but every scene he's in you can tell he's probably just come from a looney bin, or was born emotionally unstable.  You would think that while conducting their psychological tests and evaluations on each of the participants they would figure out that this guy isn't suited for this experiment, but they decide to let him in anyway.  In the original movie, it seemed like ALL the participants were normal people.  In this movie, it lets you know right off the bat at least 1 of these guys is off their rockers before the test even begins.  First big flaw in the movie logic.

And wouldn't ya know it, all the people who seem somewhat emotionally unstable just by looking at them all become the guards.  So within the first 2 days, things start to get a little out of control.  Brody initiates a prison riot when he doesn't want to eat his crappy looking food, and eventually pays for it when the guards drag him from his cell and cuff him half naked to some other place in the open.  Whitaker apparently gets off on this stuff, so you can guess where his character evolves from there.  Soon the guards escalate in their harsh treatment and less fair ways (though to be fair the prisoners occasionally acted like asses too, but in a very mild way compared to how the guards escalate it in the last half of the movie), begin to lose their grip on reality (as do the prisoners), and things start to get out of control.

Then comes a twist in the movie where one of Brody's cell mates is revealed to be an ex-prisoner.  Are you s****ing me?  How could the organization running this thing not catch that?  You would think running a background check on these guys would be mandatory.  But nope, he manages to get in on it for the money.  In the original movie, the twist was the cell mate being a member of the air force here undercover to observe all that happens and report when it's all over, which is more believable.  Not so with the American remake.

There comes a breaking point where Whitaker whacks a guy on the head with a baton, thereby killing him, and that was when the experiment should have ended.  According to the guy who instructed all of them at the start of the experiment, if any violence is done, the experiment would be over.  Safety is their first concern.  Well, I'd say that would be a good time to let the red light blare and end the whole thing.  But nope, it still continues.  Once Brody gets locked in a cylinder of some sort in a claustrophobic pitch black environment, he notices a camera is in there with him, that the people who organized the experiment anticipated things to escalate this far, thus implying they were willing to let harm come to the participants.  This is where the biggest plot hole comes into the movie.  Just think for a minute.  Can you imagine the repercussions of something like this on the organization?  There would be some serious lawsuits at the very least, damage to the reputation, among other things.  In the original German movie, we saw things from the organization's perspective, to see their logic in escalating things, reasons why they didn't stop things when they should have, reasons that made sense.  In this movie, we don't see another sign of their existence once the experiment starts, just the fact that they're supposed to see everything through the cameras that are all over the complex.

In a nutshell, Brody breaks free, lets loose the other prisoners, and big riot begins that results in the guards getting a long waited beat down.  Then the red lights finally turn on, signaling the end of the experiment, resulting in the doors opening and for everyone to realize how foolish they had been ala Lord of the Flies.  You would think there would be a whole squad of cops waiting outside or something for them, but nope, nothing for another hour.  What does come is the same bus that they arrived on to take them away.  What BS.

So to summarize, see the original instead.  It's better paced, has better character development, and is more subtle in its themes, letting the viewers learn the themes themselves rather than having it directly told to them.  Speaking of character development, in the original, you not only saw the perspectives from the guards, prisoners, and organization, but also got to know most of the people from all sides very well, which is pretty good for a 2 hour movie, which was my first worry with the remake considering it nearly shaves off 30 minutes of that time.",1304899200,,6112,4.587096774193548

The guards are given only a set of five rules they are instructed to enforce, and they are foolishly advised to avoid the use of violence. The devolution of order into chaos is reminiscent of ""The Lord of the Flies"" (and there's even a character who resembles the pathetic Piggy--and shares his unfortunate fate).

Not that I think we're inherently good (I'm a woman),  just that we are wired differently when it comes to issues of power.

3312633,4,B00127IU9I,"""The Experiment"" is fundamentally a movie about power and the machinations of people. Quite often, the average individual believes he/she is altruistic and will always place the ideals and aspirations of society above their own. ""The Experiment"" is a mirror image of the human soul that suggests people may not be as magnanimous as they claim.

""The Experiment"" is based on the 1971 Stanford Prison Experiment by Dr. Philip Zimbardo (Read Zimbardo's book, ""The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil"").  In Zimbardo's experiment, he showed that people are rule-bound more then they realize. More importantly, when average individuals are given a modicum of power, they tend to usurp the rights and choices of others.  This idea goes farther then the movie.  Look at Bernard Madoff, The Financial and Housing Industry debacle and the latest politician caught in a scandal dealing with the public trust. You think you're better, ""The Experiment"" says you're not.

To adopt any concept dealing with human nature, whether it is becoming more magnetic, charismatic, or even diabolical, you have to study and understand human nature at its core.

Watch and study ""The Experiment"".  It might be one of the most entertaining, yet informative movies you will ever see.

First the actors (and I'm being liberal here with the term)- John Hopkins does a decent job with the material he's given, but Georgina French.  I've never seen her before, but she needs to find some other line of work.  She is rigid, totally unconvincing, and occasionally inappropriately comical.  This, while playing the role of a pseudo-zombie (now how hard can that be?).  Even her topless scene is unappetizing.  The plot- there are holes here big enough to accomodate the Titanic before the sinking.  A lost, amnestic housewife with martial arts training, knocking out embassy security staff & slicing the throat of bartenders, stumbling around outside in a stuppor, with no cop in sight?  Pseudo-zombies that have so little memory left they have a hard time reading, but no difficulty using a Palm-like device to navigate back to the lab? A complicated futuristic experiment carried out off of a pedestrian tunnel, without a lock on the door or guards anywhere? (but then we would have had to incorporate some sense in the script).  A frail old man shot twice but still able to stab & instantly kill his robust professional assailant with a 4 inch knife? (never mind he's still able to communicate afterwards).  Science fiction is one thing, nonsense another.  Blank eyes on everyone except the love subject, another pseudo-zombie?  All this effort to kill a government official on a public tour (gee, anyone on this production ever hear of an IED?)  What's the point anyway?  At the end of the movie I tossed the disk (I wouldn't watch this again if I was the lone man on a 6 month trip to Mars) and looked at the bottom of my shoe to identify the source of the smell suddenly permeating my living room.

The guy said he needed sugar because he is diabetic and his blood sugar got too low. Next thing you know, without him ever eating a bite of anything he wants his insulin. The guard would not let the guy have anything to bring his sugar up. He should know that could result in a coma and potential death. Also if your blood sugar is low at the time, the last thing you want to do is give yourself a shot of insulin as your blood sugar would on;y drop lower ! Poorly researched so much that it is ruining the movie. The movie idea is wonderful ! But if you are going to make something a big deal in a movie, at least know what you are dealing with before you put it on film. Get the facts straight. How many kids learn things from movies?

An experiment in the human psyche is conducted using a prison setting where one third of the participants are guards and two thirds are inmates. They are divided up according to their interview, part of which we get to see as a way to quickly build character. Adrien Brody is a prisoner. He is the ultra liberal atheists. Forrest Whitaker, a religious fellow who believes in absolute right and wrong becomes one of the guards. The two briefly talk and connect prior to the interview process.

The participants are promised a $1,000 dollars a day as long as they follow the rules. Breaking the rules must be dealt with ""commensurately"" and within 30 minutes or else the red light comes on, the experiment is over and no one gets paid. At this point I suspected two things: 1) The red light would never come on no matter what they did and 2)There were some shills within the group. I was wrong about the second one.

While one of the rules was ""no violence"" the guards gradually test what constitutes violence. The red light becomes their ""God"" who ""approves"" of their action by inactivity. Forrest Whitaker eventually becomes the leader of the guards, even punishing his own guards who have compassion toward the prisoners. Adrien Brody becomes his rival as the leader of the prisoners.

3312642,4,B00127IU9I,Considering this is a remake of the original German film of the same title I went into this film with an open mind. The Experiment is truly worth seeing with fantastic Acting from Adrian Brody and of course Forest Whitaker! A group of people are chosen to take place in an Experiment...I don't want to spoil anything but it was difficult to stop watching as this movie takes off and does not stop until the end!

3312643,5,B00127IU9I,"What would so-called normal people do if subjected to oppressive conditions, provided that they are well paid for it, and that their actions are safely supervised, as to avoid serious consequences? Well, that is precisely what some behaviorists have done in their research throughout history, sometimes for the good mankind, and sometimes for unsound reasons. ""The Experiment"" partially answers some of the many questions in regards to these matters, providing a shocking and unforgettable look at what can happen inside a prison if conditions get out of hand.

Travis (Adrien Brody) is an easy-going fellow who just lost his job at a retirement home. While looking for a new one, he finds an ad in a newspaper which says, ""Subjects wanted for behavioral experiment. Two weeks, no experience necessary. Safe. $1,000 / Day.""  This sounds like a really good opportunity to Travis, an offer he can't refuse. He is easily selected to participate in the experiment, and Dr. Archaleta (Fisher Stevens) informs the chosen group that they would be ""simulating the conditions of life inside a state penitentiary."" They are told, among other things, that some will not have civil rights, that no violence is allowed, and that not following directives will cause their immediate dismissal from the experiment. In addition, individuals who served time in prison are not allowed. Easy... Right?  After all, it is only two-weeks.

Travis becomes friends with Barris (Forest Whitaker) before going into confinement. However, once inside the prison, some men are assigned to be prisoners and others are selected to be guards. Travis becomes part of the prisoner group and Barris will be a guard; this would be a true test of their friendship. With time, we realize that among the chosen men, there is an ex-con, a diabetic, and a psychopath. As you can imagine, this is a potentially volatile mix that will definitely compromise the experiment, affecting the behavior of the participants. Add to this that nobody wants to loose the $1,000 bucks per day that they were promised. In the end, one participant asks another, ""You still think we are higher in the evolutionary chain and monkeys?"" You'll have to figure out that one for yourself.

""The Experiment"" provides food for thought and great entertainment. You will place yourself in the position of the experiment's participants, and would ask yourself what you would do in any given circumstance. A warning, though: This film is a remake of the German film with the same title (Das Experiment, 2001), and is based on the novel ""Black Box,"" by Mario Giordano. I recommend that you see this movie without reading the book or watching the 2001 version, as it will affect your judgment of the film. (USA, 2010, color, 96 min).

3312644,3,B00127IU9I,"Almost no extras at all to distinguish this blu-ray...and when the film is mostly set in a gray prison, who really needs hi-def to see everyone's pimples in perfect clarity? This is a film to rent and not buy, in any case.

Brody and Whittaker are both good, but the script is predictable and the direction is weak. There is so much room for character detail and subtlety here, but we get almost none of that; almost every character is left barely fleshed out, and it all adds up to a could-have-been-much-better feel. Based on the infamous Stanford prison simulation of the early 70s, The Experiment is a redo of a supposedly superior film made in Germany. Perhaps that version has the certain something that this version lacks. Despite a few fine performances, this feels a little too obvious and heavy-handed, in various ways.

3312645,5,B00127IU9I,"""The Experiment"" is a movie of tension and the exploitation of the animal instinct within the human behavioral code. Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker, among a top-grade supporting cast, are two guys who, for their own separate reasons, decide to take a two-week job as either a prisoner or a guard (they don't know which until they get there) at an isolated facility made to resemble a prison where they will be monitored intently by video cameras placed strategically throughout the place. There are some rules that are applied to both prisoner and guard, and these rules only add to the creation of tense and over-the-top situations.

Be warned, there are a lot of uncomfortable moments, some blood, and Adrien has to perform a few things as an actor that I would have difficulty doing on or off the camera...as I'm sure almost anyone would.

There were a couple of question marks here, like who was making the food and cleaning the eating areas, but other than that, any potential holes in the plot were filled very cleanly and deftly.

The mixture of good story, high tension, and great actors make this little surprise of a movie one to put high on your list of flicks to watch in the near future! This should have deservedly received marketing and ample time in the theaters; it was that good! If this kind of thing (psychological thriller) is your bag, you MUST check it out!",1285286400,,1382,4.679012345679013
3312646,2,B00127IU9I,"In 1971, one of the most well-known and controversial psychological experiment's in the United States was conducted by Stanford University Professor Dr. Philip Zimbardo.  The experiment was known as the Stanford prison experiment and 24 undergraduate students participated in mock experiment in which they would play the role of guards and prisoners.  The goal was to promote disorientation, depersonalisation and deindivisualisation.

The students playing the guards adapted to their role rather quickly and ended up humiliating, hurting and causing emotional and physical trauma to the students playing the prisoners and Dr. Zimbardo played a passive role and being a scientist and not stopping the experiment until the woman he was dating confronted him for passively allowing unethical acts to be performed under his direct supervision.

The experiment lasted only six days and after the study was completed, the Dr. submitted his findings to the U.S. House Committee on Judiciary.

Because of his experiment, the findings were quite important but also highly debated.  What made the students playing the guards become abusive and oppressive?  Was it because there were no clear instructions?  Were the guards playing a part of what they felt should be the role of a guard?  And this was within six days of the experiment that all hell broke loose.

This experiment was covered in the novel ""Black Box"" by Mario Giordano and the novel would receive a 2001 German adaptation titled ""Das Experiment"".  The film is similar to 1971 the real Stanford Prison Experiment but in this case, the scientists play a passive role in observation of the inhuman and the guards not only become power hungry and oppressive to the prisoners but they go even further by killing.

In 2010, the American remake titled ""The Experiment"" which is not necessarily a remake of the German hit film ""Das Experiment"" but inspired by the film and the Stanford Prison Experiment and is directed by ""Prison Break"" TV show writer Paul Scheuring (who also wrote the screenplay adaptation) and a film that will be direct-to-video starring Oscar winners Adrien Brody (""King Kong"", ""The Darjeeling Limited"", ""The Brothers Bloom"", ""Predators"") and Forest Whitaker (""Criminal Minds"", ""Vantage Point"", ""The Shield"", ""The Last King of Scotland"").

""The Experiment"" revolves around 26 men who participate in a psychological study in which they can earn $14,000 if they continue to play the role of the prisoner and the guards for two weeks.  The study is done by Dr. Archaleta (played by Fisher Stevens) who is trying to examine how aggressive behavior is played out in an artificial prison setting.

VIDEO:

""The Experiment"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1) and the picture quality is wonderful.  You can see the detail in the skin of the faces of people, the stubble, the tattoos and anguish on the faces of the characters being oppressed.  The majority of the film is shot indoors but you do see vibrant colors more during Travis' dreams as he imagines Bay in India and we see the colors of the reds really pop.  But for the most part, the majority of the film is shot in a dreary prison set.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Experiment"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and although the majority of the film is dialogue-driven, there are some scenes in which we can hear the prisoners screaming at the guards to people getting beaten up and hit.  Even one scene with a piercing high noise when Travis is apprehended and about to be choked by one of the guards.  Overall, the film presents crisp, clear dialogue and music by Graeme Revell (""Pineapple Express"", ""Days of Wrath"", ""Eleventh Hour"", ""The Forgotten"").

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Unfortunately, ""The Experiment"" comes with no special features but does have BD-Live capability for those who want to register their Blu-ray for Sony Pictures Home Entertainment points or download trailers.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The Experiment"" is a riveting film featuring a wonderful performance by Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker.  Forest Whitaker really does a great job of playing the bible-reading, calm and collected Baris who then changes and becomes this abusive and power hungry man.

Both men do carry this film as the performances are needed because unlike ""Das Experiment"" or even the original true experiment that the film is inspired on, director and screenwriter Paul Scheuring unfortunately chooses to focus more on the inhumane practice of the guards as we see them not only become oppressive but also rapist, murders and for the most part, seeing good people turning bad.

We know that this was the case in the original Stanford Prison Experiment in 1971 and the film does a great job showing that.  The problem is that they take the doctor and scientists out of the equation.

With the real Stanford story, we know about the Dr. and him playing a passive role until he is confronted by his date who has ethical concerns in regards to his experiment and then seeing how he lost control over his own experiment and things gone awry.  In ""Das Experiment"", we see how the guards become oppressive but Dr. and scientist in this film have an integral role in which everything plays out in the end.

In ""The Experiment"", we see Dr. Archaleta briefly in the film.  His job is to study the participants who will be playing the police and prisoners but the storyline goes nowhere with it, especially around the character Dr. Archaleta.  Why would this man allow one to be suffering from diabetes and having him grow sick?  Why would the Dr. allow such brutality to happen.  Yes, it happened in the Stanford test and ""Das Experiment"" but there are scientists that have their own reasoning and in this case, it was getting out of hand that murder, rape and other inhumane things were taking place and yet, no one stopped it.

The whole chilling experiment was covered well in the film but I felt the storyline was not well-conceived, felt a bit rushed and the ending was not at all satisfying.  ""Das Experiment"" shows the repercussions towards the scientists who have let this experiment grow chaotic, inhumane and deadly and allows the viewer to put a face to the people behind the experiment.  With ""The Experiment"",  I was not satisfied how they chose to end the film and it was simply a lazy way to end the film and destroyed any potential of the film to achieve a thrilling ending like ""Das Experiment"".

The Blu-ray release does sport very good picture quality and the dialogue is clear and understandable but for a newer film, was shocked that there were no special features at all.  It would have been wonderful for director/screenwriter Paul Scheuring to explain his thoughts on the making of the film especially the ending via an audio commentary but unfortunately, we are not giving anything extra for the film.  No interviews, no featurettes...nothing.

Overall, ""The Experiment"" had so much potential, especially if it was inspired from ""Das Experiment"".  Even if they did a straight copy of the German film in English, viewers would have enjoyed a thrilling ending and a much more understandable plot.  But unfortunately, despite the wonderful performance by Adrian Brody and Forest Whitaker and also the thrilling scenes that involve both men, the film just doesn't give the viewer any satisfying closure  and the Blu-ray release has no special features at all.

3312647,5,B00127IU9I,"When looking up the new releases here on Amazon, seeing this movie NOT on the few movies listed on the main page was a real mistake in my opinion. I even went to 3 stores looking for this movie and the first 2 had no idea what movie I was requesting and didn't even have it on release day! I saw a trailer for it a few months ago and immediately knew I had to have it.
The basic story is: Volunteers will be paid for an experiment where they are put into a simulated prison experience. Stressfull challenges are then introduced throughout the experiment. If any physical attacks are observed between the guards and prisoners, the experiment will end and no one gets paid. We meet Adrian Brody and Forest Whitaker introducing themselves to one another prior to the experiment and we see that these are 2 very different people but there is a mutual respect forming. We then find out, some volunteers will be guards and some will be prisoners.
Amazing performances by Adrien Brody, Forest Whitaker, Clifton Collins Jr. and many more supporting roles, will have you sitting on the edge of your seat through the whole movie. It is clear, at the beginning, some volunteers  are going to be trouble and as the movie moves along, power does corrupt even the best of the men but we feel for them because they are told, ""you will not get paid if you do not follow and enforce the rules.""
I do NOT agree with Amazon's review that this movie ""never quite grabs hold"". By the end of the movie, I was almost in tears after watching men who respected each other at the beginning, couldn't even look each other in the eye by the end. There isn't much more to say.

It was very satisfying in story ,acting and conclusion. The experiment is where men are paid 1000 dollars a day to supposedly Simulate either a Prisoner or a guard in a maximum security setting,no one knows which they will be until they enter the facility..

Adrien Brody is an uber hottie in my opinion and a great actor he plays an anti violence anti war advocate,but just how long and how much can he take before he changes his way of thinking to an eye for an eye? The stand out was Forest Whitaker as a man given authority as a guard in a make believe world, but in actuality he's s 42 year old man living with his coddling,emasculating mother. He see's this as a way to get back at her by being cruel to those put in a weaker position because he feels weak in her presence. In one shocking scene he pops a woody just after handcuffing and humiliating Brody's character.

Cam Gigandet is evil as another faux guard who in his characters real life lives for sex, drugs and sleep..
He takes a shine to an effeminate faux prisoner and does some very evil things to him..This movie is quite brutal and hard to watch at times,some of the acts that are put upon Brody especially are very humiliating and would be hard for any man to take..

We still carry tendencies of following the herd and going along with the alpha male even though we know what is morally and ethically right or wrong.

Given a set of parameters or rules to follow in order to achieve a monetary gain, we lose humanity and succumb to greed, ego and lack of compassion.  This is a powerful movie and it is a story that is reminiscent of Lord of the Flies except we're dealing with adults.

The story was very contrived and overdone. A recommended movie for Prime. I really think they should choose ones not so sub par. My advice is to pick something else, unless you are in need of something to study for what is not good.",1504828800,,395,4.142857142857143
