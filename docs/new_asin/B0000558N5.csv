7930922,5,B0000558N5,"This PBS series was a favorite of mine during its initial broadcast run, so I was particularly excited about the DVD's. You'll be impressed by the wide range of musical artists and styles; each artist pulled from various episodes of the series.",1397174400,,244,4.833333333333333
7930923,5,B0000558N5,This collection has great performances to watch from the past.  All of the bands/groups are gitchy. Some are favorites of ours.,1381363200,,127,5.0476190476190474
7930924,2,B0000558N5,"This dvd fails to capture the intensity and fun of the others in the series.  Although there are a few acts that do rise above the mediocrity, over all this is just not a good purchase. If you are desperate for some live music, yu would be best served looking elsewhere.  The afro-cuban allstars and ozomatli ARE excellent here - and that crazy imani coppola is a high point, but overall this is not a step forward for the series. Spend elsewhere.",1065225600,5,447,4.439024390243903
7930925,2,B0000558N5,"i waited 3 months for the release of this dvd. compared to the first sessions at w54 , it is a bit disappionting. the 1st sessions contained multiple individual outstanding performances. while the acoustics remain excellent on vol 2 ,  i remained relatively unstimulated. steve earle , ozomatli , john hiatt , and afro-cuban all stars are very good on this dvd. because of the greatness of sessions keb mo 97 , and sessions  vol 1, i look forward to vol 3.",985564800,6,456,4.548780487804878
7930926,5,B0000558N5,"The Sessions DVDs are a great way to enjoy an eclectic group of performers. Where else can you have Neil Finn, Lyle Lovett and the Kronos Quartet. Like Vol. 1, Vol. 2 showcases artists you know and some you may not be acquainted with. Don't forget to check out the special features. David Byrne's intros and interviews are available and good for subsequent viewings when you want to explore individual songs and artists more. This DVD also includes Costello and Bacharach performing ""Painted from Memory."" Come on Sony, my VHS of this incredible Sessions session is wearing out. Get that DVD out there!",985564800,5,602,4.854368932038835
7930927,2,B0000558N5,"It lacks a general overall theme, and seems to be a mismatched conglomerate of different artist not always at their best.  It is worth watching once, but I would not recommend purchasing it.",979689600,12,190,4.757575757575758
