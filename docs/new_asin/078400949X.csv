72120,5,078400949X,This is probably one of the most beautiful stories of the first Christmas and brings back such fond memories of childhood. Please help to get this video released again.  It should be available to be shared with every  generation.,947030400,2,229,4.846153846153846

72122,5,078400949X,"The newest angel in Heaven, Johnny Whitaker (Jody from ""Family Affair"") meets up with fellow angel Fred Gwynn (Herman Munster from ""The Munsters"") in this charming story of two angels who just  cannot seem to do things the right way.  The music is wonderful and the  movie itself can stand on it's own.  It is my Christmas wish for 1999 that  Bridgestone once again put this wonderful movie into production.  They will  not be sorry!",944265600,26,433,4.693333333333333
72123,2,078400949X,"I watched this particular program when I was a small child, and I had great recollections about it, but thirty years can make a big difference. What I expected was a heartwarming, well produced, Christmas special. What  I got was poor, early attempts at blue screen special effects that were  distracting, and poorly executed (the scene where the shepherd boy enters  the gates of Heaven is especially groan worthy). The people who reissued  this video should have also restored color and sound. Time has made a crisp  picture, and bright colors, look faded. Everyone and everything comes out  looking slightly pink or green.  The story is, at 77 minutes  long, about an hour too long. Several of the songs could have been cut  without making a hole in the plot. Still, the story does have a good moral,  and Tony Randall, Cab Calloway, and Fred Gwynne (when he's not mugging too  much ala Herman Munster) give fine, noteworthy performances.  I recommend this clumsy production for the people  who love productions from a time gone by. If nostalgia, and Nick-at-Nite or  TV Land are your cup of tea, then despite all its flaws, you may still  enjoy this step back to the good old days of T.V.",944265600,,1192,4.718446601941747
72124,5,078400949X,"I remembered watching this show as a Hallmark Hall of Fame special when I was a kid.  I have loved this story ever since.  Each holiday season I thought about this story and how it always made me cry.  A few years ago  while Christmas Shopping I found a beautiful hard covered copy of the book.  I searched for a long time for the video but to no avail until Amazon.com.  The video is obviously made in the 60's but the quality was excellent.  Johnny Whittaker, (from the 60's show Family Affair), and Fred Gwynn, (from  the shows Car 54 Where are you and The Munsters), were believeable angels.  The ending still brings a tear to my eye.  A very enjoyable film,  especially for the over 40 set who can rememeber the 60's.  My kids also  loved it since they always think of it as the show and book mommy always  cries over.",943920000,10,823,4.294117647058823

72176,4,078400949X,"I bought it as a Christmas gift for my wife.  She remembered listening to the soundtrack of the show as a child when she was sick in bed (before they found out she was allergic to pine...  Her sisters still blame her for not being able to have a live tree after that.)  The DVD brought back memories for her and we all enjoyed watching it.  If you can get past the idea of a Christmas story that starts out with the main character dying in the first 10 minutes (heck, Dickens started A Christmas Carol with ""Marley was dead"", so who am I to judge) the story of a little boy who has trouble finding a way of fitting in as an angel still holds up pretty well with its message of a gift from the heart being the best gift of all.  The cast includes an surprising number of stars from the time the show was filmed and they seem to all be having fun despite having to walk around wearing long, white, pleated robes and cardboard wings.  The musical numbers are fun to watch and listen to, if a bit campy.  If you remember the show with fond memories from your childhood, you'll probably enjoy it.

From a technical standpoint has some major , the picture quality is not up to the level of shows made now: the picture is grainy and blurred, especially the outdoor shots.  The special effects, probably done using blue or green screen techniques, were most likely ""state of the art"" at the time, but they look amateurish by today's standards.  If you're thinking of getting it to share with your children or grand children, don't be surprised if they are put off by these technical shortcomings or think it's ""lame"" compared to the ""edgier"" Christmas shows that they are coming out with now.",1420156800,4,1684,4.385852090032154

72179,1,078400949X,"This is a joke and a shame that Amazon would ship me this crap.  It is not that the story is not good, but it literally looks like someone played it on their t.v and recorded it with a camcorder.  I cannot believe how poor the quality is and I got it out to watch with my 7-year old, to watch a movie that had spoken to me when I was 7, I had to put up with barely watchable quality.

72184,5,078400949X,I saw this when it originally aired on TV in the 1960's and have been hoping it would be released on DVD.  Johnny Whittaker 's character reminds me of my brother who died when he was a child.  If you've lost a sibling during their childhood or lost a young child - well have a box of kleenex at hand when you watch it; but it will be a good cry.,1416355200,,345,3.8450704225352115

72198,3,078400949X,"This production was a very mixed bag, or blessing if you prefer.  Johnny Whitaker was pretty amazing...had to sing a lot of songs and remember a lot of dialog.  His raspy voice, though on key, got to be like fingernails on a chalkboard after a while.  It was slow moving...needed a major editing.  The songs were variable as well...a few were pretty good, others below average in melody and lyrics, but kept things moving between the overly long dialog.  The well known players were left to coax what little they could from a hokey script.  I did enjoy seeing some of these actors, like Fred Gwynne, Tony Randall, John McGiver, E. G. Marshall etc...  The set design was kind of interesting, though dreary, even amusingly bad, and hardly flattering as a picture of heaven...the angel garments in pale pink wouldn't look good on just about anyone.  Armed with my trusty remote, I was able to get some entertainment out of short section of this show, but trying to watch it straight through without the ability to speed things up would take someone with angelic patience.",1390521600,,1068,4.735135135135135

72210,5,078400949X,"Forget the cartoon versions! Watch veteran actors weave a magic spell around the tale of a very young angel struggling to earn his wings while wreaking minimal damage to the heavens around him.

Johnny Whitaker was an ideal choice for the little angel; he looks like someone designed by Mattel Toy Company, and has a subdued, charming spunk about him as he carefully learns the ropes as a fledgling angel, then gets recklessly creative to the benefit of all.

The effects work are what you would expect from the era and certainly lack the finesse we enjoy today. But it's VERY adequate for 1970s video, which is a far more difficult and unforgiving medium than its motion picture counterparts.

The songs are well-authored and there are two fairly haunting ones: when guardian angel Fred Gwynne lapses into nostalgia about his own mortal life of ages past (""Once Upon Another Time""); and the magnificent chorus of the angels preparing their gifts for the first Christmas (""May It Bring Him Pleasure""), where the Little Angel manages to upstage them all with a simple, childish gift that has greater heart than anything the more experienced angels could produce.

All in all this has a charm that cartoons can't match in spite of all its technical glitches: it has an ALIVE feel, and even small kids sense the difference and prefer this version to animated ones.

I think that my parents must have only let me watch the first 10 minutes and I liked seeing Buffy as a shepherd boy, or by the time I saw it the network had edited it down from 72 minutes running to fit a 30 minute slot.  I showed it to my 8 year old the other day, and he said of the depiction of heaven, unprompted, ""this would be hell for me.""  The cheezy sets with dangling foam balls with visible strings representing planets and stars, the peach colored smoke, and the elementary school costumes and halos were too much to bear. The production values are like something some teenagers with a camcorder would put on youtube.  And the songs, the silly scenes of the Johny Whitaker trying to fly, waiting in line for an angel job, etc. just drag on and on and on.  It is worse than watching four consecutive strawberry shortcake videos.  And it is just plain creepy.

Christian parents may be tempted to get this video because of the theme (stolen from The Little Drummer Boy) that Jesus appreciates our gifts both great and humble.  But this is heaven as imagined by Liberace, Lawrence Welk, or Tony Orlando and Dawn--schmaltz, pink smoke, harps and wings, solitude and boredom against a black set.

72241,4,078400949X,"""The Littlest Angel"" began when legendary Hollywood star Loretta Young befriended renowned writer Charles Tazewell (who also wrote ""The Small One,' which Disney later animated). Tazewell promised to write something especially for her, and some time later, a script arrived at her house: ""The Littlest Angel.""

Young set about to record the script for Decca Records, but was at a retreat (she was a devout Catholic) and told her agent the recording session had to wait until after that weekend. However, Greer Garson had read the script in a Decca office and was going to record it unless Young did it first. Young raced from the retreat, recorded the six-disc 78 RPM with a full orchestra, and returned to the retreat without missing a prayer. Even the musicians were amazed how they were able to record it in a flash with no problems.

The record album was a huge hit, was later released on vinyl, performed on radio, and adapted into a book by Tazewell.  One of the reasons Young was so touched by the story is because she and her husband has suffered through miscarriaged and considered her lost children as ""angels in heaven."" Therein lies the issue -- this fantasy is indeed about a little boy who dies, goes to heaven, has trouble fitting in, and ultimately gives a great gift. But it's more than a story about death -- it's about life everlasting, and that's why Hallmark made it into a musical special in 1969.

The music and lyrics are by Lan o""kun, a longtime collaborator with Shari Lewis who co-wrote an episode of Star Trek with her. The arrangements are by John Morris, who added so much to Mel Brooks films of the 70's and wrote ""The French Chef."" The case is superb and the production values are way way way out of date by today's standards, but back then they were the best TV could do with limited time, budgets, and the tools they had. Today, you can do better effects on your PC, but one might be forgiving when appreciating this show in context.

That all said, even though I love the music (and listen to the LP record almost every Christmas), and have had the VHS tape for years, I'm waitng for the right time to show this to my young children. My wife and I have watched it together (and we have experienced the losses of loved ones), and enjoy the show for what it is. We'd like to share it with the kids, but we're waiting for the right year. It may be this year, but we'll see.

72247,2,078400949X,"This little television nugget premiered in 1969 on television for one showing only. The show was intended to be an uplifting tale of angels and Heaven. Instead, this pre-teen targeted program scared the bejesus out of the kids by showing them that children die horrifying deaths and are unable to ever speak or hear from their parents again. Apparently, even in those non-PC times parents were horrified by this show to such a degree that they called and complained in droves. To my knowledge it never aired again.

I was seven when this program premiered and I had been through the ordeal of my little sister's death from cancer. I had been through the death of other family members. This program was cold comfort. It traumatized me and I am still affected by it in a very negative way.

Little Michael (Johnny Whitaker) chases a dove sent from God, only to run right off a cliff and die. The angels allow him to return home to retrieve a treasured keepsake but he is unable to speak to his parents and they are unable to see or hear him.

I don't know how this figured as holiday/Christmas fare, but it was presented around Christmas time. I know it has stuck in my mind all these thirty plus years later and not in a good way. I have always found myself worrying about the death of relatives and I'm convinced this film has added to some of that stress.

Definitely NOT for young children unless you want to traumatize them.",1162857600,7,1427,4.51937984496124
72248,4,078400949X,"I saw this again recently for the first time since it first appeared on TV. That was a special occasion because a cousin of mine in Charleston had just gotten their first color tv and we gathered there to watch this in 1969. As a five year old who was seeing color television for the first time (for those under 35- imagine this), it blew me away and the story left me with what my earliest images of what heaven would be like.

Admittedly, seeing this as a grown man gives me some pause. While not as sickening to my stomach as the ""New Zoo Revue"" or the Sid and Marty Kroft stuff, nor does it have the eternal appeal of Bullwinkle or the Flintstones, it's okay for nostaligia or if you're watching it with small children. The scenes of Johnny Whittaker (who will forever be ""Jody"" of ""Family Affair"" to my g-g-generation) walking on the fake stairway to heaven is somewhat amusing (the hokey special effex here) and as usual, Cab Calloway steals the show as the Angel Gabriel blowing his horn.

With all of that said, the film is not without it's charm. The is a sweetness and innocence to the overall story and it is admittedly unfair to judge the 1969 special effex to 21st century standards. What I liked best about the film is Fred Gwynne's performance as Patience, the guardian angel who's aboard to show Johnny Whittaker the ropes of heavenly life. This was probably his best role. He adds just enough whimsy and charm to keep the tale from beaing overbearably corny. Additionally, he's very likeable as a concerned man who wants the boy to do right while expressing a necessary concern for Whittaker's feelings. The type of big brother figure evey boy would wish to have (besides, what kid would not want to hang out with Herman Munster)?

There are some concerns from parents about the theme about a child's early death and the reactions from parents of deceased children and siblings of such children. Being that I'm not a parent, I cannot comment on that with authority. There are also those who have issues over the religious content of this and the depictions of God and heaven. To the latter, I could only say that one of the drawbacks to our time is the tendency of modern audiences to read WAY too much into such stories. Just see it for what it was clearly intended in 1969 and the original book in 1946, an innocent and sweet story designed to do nothing more than charm audiences.

72250,5,078400949X,"I remember seeing this Hallmark Hall of Fame special when I was a small child, but we had to leave about half way into it, to go

somewhere.  Even though I looked for it for many years,

it was never shown again. I even remember being in a Sunday School ""Littlest Angel"" play.

Recently, I saw(and immediately bought)it at a dollar store as a double feature DVD(by Treasure Box/Family Value Collection)which included ""Little Boy Lost"" starring Nathan Dawes. The box says digitally remastered. The quality is suprising good considering that is was shot on video for the tv show; and the blue screen is very good for a low budget production done in 1969.  Hallmark Productions were always known for their great performances, and not their budget scenery or props, anyway.

Well, for a $1.00 and after 36 years, I finally got to watch the whole thing from start to finish, and must say it really moved me. The music and performances were quite good.  Seeing all those, now deceased, great actors and performers,(e.g.,Fred Gwyne, Tony Randall, Cab Calloway, James Coco, and EG Marshall), reminded me of all my late relatives, who were part of my

childhood and Christmas celebrations.

Johnny Whitaker did an absolutely incredible job of acting and

singing(reminded me of a male Shirley Temple).  I think it is truly a sad injustice for Hallmark not to have made this an annual Christmas staple, like ""Rudolph.."" or ""The Grinch Who.."" is.  It has all the qualities that make it deserve to be a holiday classic.

I don't know if I could watch it again, only because of all the

emotions I felt.  As a child, I really didn't understand or remember, that the lead character died at the very beginning.  I just remember that he was in heaven. Even our Sunday School Christmas play started out with the kid in heaven.

Coincidentally, I recently saw the present day Johnny Whitaker, on a pathetic show, called ""Elimidate"". He's aged relatively well - same recognizable face and red hair, but, obviously, older and heavier.  He seems like a joyful and very likeable soul (much like his ""Family Affair"" Jody character). It's a real shame his career didn't take off, despite all of his extraordinary talent as a child actor.",1135468800,3,2213,4.794195250659631
72251,1,078400949X,"I always remembered The Littlest Angel from when I was a kid, and I hadn't seen it in probably 30 years. I remembered it as being creepy. This year, I saw it listed on Amazon on DVD, and I picked up a copy to watch this Christmas season.

Watching it again, it is, by far, the cheesiest and CREEPIEST Christmas special ever made. I don't normally question other people's opinions, but I scratch my head at how anyone could like this special. While the overall message isn't particularly bad, the story leading up to it is awful. Near as I can figure, this was a vehicle to propel Johnny Whitaker onto Shirley Temple-level stardom, but the production was done totally on the cheap by amateurs, and it turned into a train wreck.

The entire premise is disturbing from the get-go. An eight-year-old shepherd boy, the only child of a happy Middle Eastern family in 0 BC, and quite probably the only person ever of Middle Eastern heritage with red hair and freckles, falls off a mountain and dies while chasing a bird. He winds up in heaven, and has trouble adjusting. In the end, everything turns out OK, because he winds up giving the best gift out of all the souls in heaven to baby Jesus.

Now, aside from the fact the special starts out with an eight-year-old boy dying in an accident, the special continues to hit sour notes. His life on earth seemed happy, and heaven looks like hell. Basically, everyone in heaven walks around in this vast empty space with cheesy decorations hanging, and their eternal lives seem to consist of either standing in lines or doing busy work. Also, he seems to be the first person in history to ever have died in childhood because there are no other children in heaven (which is, in no small part, the reason he has trouble adjusting). You think ""Man, I wouldn't want to be there either"". Truly, one of the lowest points of the special is when Johnny Whitaker is allowed to go back to earth to retrieve the gift for Baby Jesus, and you see his anxious parents wondering why it is taking their only son so long to get home. Mercifully, the producers of the special did not include the scene where the parents find their son's broken body at the base of the mountain.

The incredible paradox of this special is that it had a really good cast of B-list celebrites at the time...Fred Gwynne, Tony Randall, James Coco, Cab Calloway, EG Marshall. I can only imagine the actors showing up to the set, seeing the script and the sets, and immediately calling their agents in a fury of anger, asking ""What did you get me involved with??!!""

It's worth a look if you vaguely remember it from being a kid and want to rehash it like I did. However, there is absolutely no reason for anyone to introduce this to a new generation.",1135296000,5,2748,4.498997995991984
72252,4,078400949X,"The technical aspects of this review refer to the Westlake Entertainment Group release.

Based on the classic children's book by Charles Tazewell comes this feature originally broadcast on ""Hallmark Hall of Fame"" in 1969. As an 11 year old at the time, I remember watching this on the ol' black and white TV each year it was broadcast. The show didn't catch on as a continuing holiday tradition and was shuffled off to TV oblivion. Therefore, it was a completely unexpected joy to discover this on DVD.

Having not seen it for 25 plus years, I was wondering if I would view it as fondly as my memories were of the program. The first thing I noticed was it is a musical. I remember musical aspects of the show, but, it is a true musical and I think it plays much better for adults that way.

Starring Johnny Whitaker (of ""Family Affair"" fame) as Michael a shepherd boy who falls from a rock cliff and ascends to heaven. There he is greeted by God (E.G. Marshall) who sends him through the gates where he is welcomed by Gabriel (Cab Calloway!, that's worth the price of admission right there). Character actor John McGiver assigns Fred Gwynne (""The Munsters"", ""Car 54, Where Are You?"") as Michael's guardian angel and introduces Michael to the wonders of heaven. Along the way Michael learns to fly with the help of flying teacher Connie Stevens and waits in a line for his heavenly job only to be befriended by a Roman who doesn't believe he is where he is, superbly played by Tony Randall. With the exception of E. G. Marshall and John McGiver, they all have a musical number. The highlight for me was Fred Gwynne's solo number of him reminiscing of his time on earth. He put such conviction in the number, when the song ends, you are right there with him wishing he could return.

Michael is still unhappy in Heaven and is allowed back to earth to retrieve his ""treasure box"" of artifacts from earth. When he returns, it is the night of the Messiah's birth. All angels are to present gifts and Michael presents the most special one of all.

I was just as touched at the ending of this program this time around, probably more so than the first time I saw it.

The drawback for a lot of people will probably be the technical parts of the program. First, notice I don't say movie or film. Although the first few minutes are filmed, the rest is videotaped. Made in 1969, this had to be one of the first productions that utilized the blue or green screen for the whole production. As such, it certainly is not on a par with what they can do today. But do all things have to be perfect? Can't you use a little imagination? With that said, there are a couple of glitches that lasts only for a couple of seconds in the master tape, probably due to the age, nothing to keep you from enjoying this story that brought back a lot of memories from Christmases long ago. The run time is listed as 90 minutes but actually runs 77 minutes.

Thanks to the release of this DVD, this will again be a tradition in my household.  And with the low price, there is no reason for it not to be in your home also.",1100995200,91,3088,4.386363636363637

The version offered here is a cartoon, not the Whittaker movie, and the picture of the cover needs to be that of the cartoon.",1096416000,24,739,4.235714285714286

Well, weep no more folks!!! You can buy it at ChristianBook.com and the best thing is.....it is only 3.99!!!!  I am unsure of the quality as I have not watched my copy yet.  I hope this makes your holiday out there!

72258,4,078400949X,"This page advertises a film version of this story starring Johnny Whitaker.  I ordered a copy and received a cartoon version of the children's book by Charles Tazwell.  It is a poignant story that I loved as a young child.  However, buyers should be aware that it is NOT the film version.  It is a cartoon.  In addition it is a very old cartoon with static and not the quality animation that we have grown accustomed to.  The box lists the copyright date as 1988, but I strongly suspect this is a re-release date.  The quality appears to be at least 25 years older than that to our family.  It is still an enjoyable cartoon.  My children and I enjoyed watching it.  But buyers should be aware of what they are getting when they order this version.",1006041600,3,747,4.386861313868613

I can't even finish the book version without seeing Johnnie Whitaker's angel face in my mind.  This story exemplifies the true meaning of Christmas.  I have been trying to buy a copy for at least 10 years.  If anyone else out there feels the same way, write in, maybe they will re-release it.

7790743,2,078400949X,"Still a cute movie...but digitally remastered my butt. Very poor video quality.

I certainly don't remember it being that crappy when I was a kid...but I'm sure my standards were different then.",1488758400,,194,5.0625
7790744,4,078400949X,"Yes, the ""special effects"" are way hokey (Connie Stevens virtually disappears at one point because the Matte effect is so poor) but that is part of the charm of this version.

I have always loved to watch little Johnny Whitaker.  There's just something about little red-heads that touches my heart and he is so adorable!

If this DVD has been digitally remastered, then it had a bad copy to base that from!  The show was a low budget (but big name) production back in the 60s and it shows in this production.

The bad special effects does not diminish the heart of the show with the little boy trying to come to terms with suddenly being an angel.  Even though I knew the story, I still cried at the end when his box became the Star of Bethlehem.

Well worth the trouble of finally finding this version of the story.",1483747200,,816,4.4
