6141860,3,B00H91LWBY,"Some films feel very important and feel as though they grasp at a deeper meaning but also feel as though they cant possibly reach that meaning to a wider audience because their scope is limited to a specific environment.  You watch these films with an open mind, but because you are so far removed from the subject it all washes over like broadly stroked portraits of events that mean one thing to us (Violence!  Greed!  Corruption!), but don't truly mean to us what they mean to those who live in the midst of it.  Yes, we all experience the universal effects of things such as violence and corruption, but a film that dwells on the immediate effect felt by the Chinese cant possibly probe that same feeling in the hearts of an American man who has never set foot on Chinese soil or read up on their political history.

Unless its filmed with a sense of awareness of that fact.

Sadly, for me, A Touch of Sin failed to make these cultural plights feel transcendent.  Instead, this felt like a blanketed wall of facts that don't translate to an audience unfamiliar with the core.  Watching the film, it was a very beautifully shot film that portrayed many fragments of ugly souls but it never felt like more than that.

People do bad things.

For me, this is the main reason why a film like A Touch of Sin doesnt really work.  In stringing along these fragmented stories, the film doesnt really touch down firmly on anything.  These stories, on their own, can be compelling (especially the opening story regarding a miner fighting corruption) but they don't exactly mesh together properly.  The stories feel disjointed, connected only through very broad terms, but overall they just feel slapped together without any real reason.  I found the narrative structure to be a detriment to the film.  Without much weight really given to these specific stories, they become harsh sequences of violence with no real meat on their bones.

This being said, the film is beautifully shot, and Wu Jiang delivers a marvelous performance as Dahai, the frustrated miner in the films most compelling story.  I just wish that the film felt more grounded and not merely like a cheap attempt at capitalizing on an unhealthy political system.  There is no real detail here, just random violent encounters that are there to expose human weakness, but with no developed backstory they feel hollow and unable to really do the good they could do.  We learn nothing from these stories, take nothing away from them and in the end, they serve no real purpose.

It all feels so vain and underdeveloped.",1398124800,3,2573,4.726457399103139
6141861,1,B00H91LWBY,"For any of you who are unfortunate enough to watch this piece of junk by Jia, I am here to expose the hypocrisy and inadequacy of the film.

As a true-blue Chinese, this film is a very untruthful representation of the Chinese people and the society. I agree that some of the things that happened in this film are real, bribery, corruption and other ills but it seems that Jia himself has nothing else to offer other than stringing these happenings in a pseudo-documentary style and blast it in the viewer's face for 2hours. I am indignant, because it seems as if the only thing Jia is capable of doing is SHOUTING THIS IS THE EVIL CHINA. LOOK WE ARE EVIL. WE ARE THIS UGLY. WE HAVE NO RELIGION.

Jia made no attempt to probe the deeper meaning behind all these social phenomenon, which I think is much more meaningful than just ""stating the facts"". If we wanted a laundry list of the problems that exist in China, we can easily turn to any decent major media and feast on the various China news on there. Jia is really a clown. A clown who is unsophisticated, who can only turn to violence(and does a bad job at doing it) to cover up for the fact that there is zero meaning in this film, and portray the chinese people in a way that is awkward, deliberate and inaccurate. Jia should be ashamed of himself, because all of us who are a little more acquainted with China will know his intent is to appeal to those who are interested in China, but do not have the luxury to actually live and breathe China. And you cannot smoke ON THE BUS SINCE GOD KNOWS WHEN.

If you really cared enough to watch this stupid film and would like to understand and see the real China, I urge you to watch Blind Shaft(2003) and Blind Mountain(2007). Please disregard anything that you've seen in this film, because this is a China which only exist in nowhere.",1397952000,,1837,4.381231671554252
6141862,5,B00H91LWBY,"A strong condemnation of what's become of China  capitalistically greedy and corrupt; industrialized, polluted, and insensitive to the needs of the working class.

Mao would have a really bad time relating to Chinese corporate executives with private jets. Not quite the people's revolution he had in mind.

Social commentary with a lethal dose of violence  not some empty-headed actioner.

You can only bend people so far before they snap.

Based on true events. Winner of the best screenplay at Cannes.

If you liked the episodic structure of Pulp Fiction, Chungking Express or Amores Perros, you'll be right at home here.

Fans of No Country For Old Men will undoubtedly enjoy the first of the film's four slightly interrelated episodes.

6141865,3,B00H91LWBY,"I love foreign films. Especially Chinese. Anything involving Chow Yun-Fat or Bruce Lee is a staple in my movie collection. What caught my eye about Touch of Sin was the main actor featured on the DVD cover, Jiang Wu. I am a huge fan of his recent Chinese blockbuster crime caper, Let the Bullets Fly. It features enough action, comedy, and ingenious plot twists while remaining distinctly Chinese. Touch of Sin is very well made, but it fizzles and falls flat after transitioning from one character's story to another.

Many professional critics have noted that Touch of Sin uses stylized violence as a critical commentary on contemporary Chinese society. While I like over-the-top action in movies, Touch of Sin misses the mark. I fail to grasp how the director wants foreign audiences to view China. Is it the new Wild West where power struggles and neighborhood disputes are solved on the streets? Is China about to crack from overpopulation and a surging economy created to fill the government's coffers? I'm not sure what the sociopolitical meaning of this film is supposed to be. I can't view it as anything other than a violent drama that doesn't make sense.

Touch of Sin fails because its too Chinese. Foreign films meant to arouse strong emotions, like dramas and comedies, are sometimes lost in translation for audiences outside of the native country. Touch of Sin is one of these movies. The action and cinematography are great. The script and scenes interspersed in between these graphic events are not so appealing. Had Touch of Sin been filmed strictly as a stylized action movie, I would have probably liked it more. Otherwise, I cannot watch it past the first half.",1395532800,,1682,4.898245614035088

6141867,3,B00H91LWBY,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

The title of 'A Touch of Sin', Jia Zhangke's latest commentary on crime and corruption in Chinese society today, appears to have a double meaning. First the 'sins' in the title, refer to either the violent actions of the four protagonists Zhangke has culled from the headlines in modern day China today, or the ruling forces that led them to commit such violent acts. The word 'touch', of course is meant to be wholly ironic; as the violent acts themselves are way more than just a 'touch', and the level of violence (as Zhangke suggests) permeates the entire society.

But the title also refers to the 1971 Chinese epic action film, 'A Touch of Zen'. The 'Zen' narrative is written in the style of a Wuxia story, which roughly translates as 'Martial Hero'. Wuxia heroes often came from the lower social classes in ancient China and were bound by a code of chivalry that required them, according to Wikipedia, ""to right wrongs, fight for righteousness, remove an oppressor, redress wrongs and bring retribution for past misdeeds.""

The first of the four stories in 'A Touch of Sin', focuses on Dahai, a coal mining company employee, who is the former classmate of the corporate boss in a provincial town. Dahai, like a Wuxia hero, seeks to right wrongs and fight for righteousness, but ends up becoming unhinged, after confronting the boss, as he arrives at the local airport in his private jet. Dahai's main complaint is that the boss reneged on his offer of profit sharing to his employees. After suffering a humiliating public beat down by the boss' thugs and an attempt to buy him off after he's hospitalized, Dahai goes on a rampage and murders the boss' underlings as well as the boss himself.

The second and least successful of the stories involves a migrant worker, Zhou San, who dispatches three youths who try to rob him while he rides his motorcycle, at the beginning of the film. Zhou turns up at his mother's 70th birthday party but tells his wife that he can't remain at home. We later find out why: Zhou earns his money by shooting strangers on a crowded street and stealing their handbags.

Perhaps the most developed of the four stories, is the third one. Xiao Yu (Zhangke's wife in real life) is a receptionist at a sauna. Her married lover wants her to move to the town where he works, but she refuses, since he's still married. Xiao gets beaten up upon orders of the man's wife but later faces even more danger. A corrupt government official who we earlier see attempt to shake down a transportation worker on a public highway, attempts to sexually assault Xiao at the sauna. She uses a knife (which she took at the train station from her married lover, after he wasn't allowed to carry it on to the train), and stabs the government official multiple times, preventing him from raping her.

Finally, there's the story of Xiao Hui, a young man, who breaks company rules by chatting with a co-worker while work is going on. The co- worker is injured and Xiao Hui is ordered to work, with all his earnings given to the injured co-worker, for the time he's out on sick leave. Xiao Hui flees to another city where he takes a job as a greeter at a high-end sex club, The Golden Age. He befriends a girl there but their relationship fizzles after he realizes she can't escape her job as a 'comfort woman'. Xiao ends up at the grim 'Oasis of Prosperity', a housing complex for workers who toil endless hours on an assembly line. When the co-worker who was injured earlier tracks Xiao down and demands payment of his money, Xiao ends up jumping off the roof.

As a film, 'A touch of Sin', has a schizoid quality. On one hand, Zhangke's does a commendable job of exposing the ills of contemporary Chinese society. The disparity between rich and poor is illustrated in the first story, where promises of worker compensation are never met. The image of the local population, forced to come out to welcome the corporate boss at the airport, as he arrives on his private jet, sticks in one's memory. In the second story, the heinous nature of crimes committed by cold-blooded criminals who escape the bar of justice, is highlighted in high relief. In the third story, the plight of women who are exploited by sexually abusive men, who occupy positions of power, is revealed. And finally, the dehumanization of people in general, through assembly line work, leads one young man in particular, to take his own life.

Despite exposing the ills of modern day China, Zhangke, perhaps owing to his love for the martial arts action epic, appears to revel in the violence he purportedly so detests. Particularly in the first two episodes (and even in the third), the violence seems to appear on screen, for its own sake. There's a great deal of blood-letting but never any consequences (no one ever seems to react when someone is killed). There's more of a story in the third episode, but even there, the stabbing by the victimized sauna worker, has more of a vengeful than defensive tone.

The performances and the cinematography are persuasive. Nonetheless, the pacing is quite languid and there's a lack of solid character development. Yes, Zhangke has managed to illustrate a number of stories culled from contemporary headlines, detailing the basic facts about each character--but unfortunately, the overall narrative called for more (and certainly with a little less sensationalism). As of this date, it's my understanding that 'A Touch of Sin' has not been shown in China, due to censorship. Hopefully, that situation will change, since the film also offers some correctives for those who maintain an iron grip on millions, who toil, with little hope for economic and political freedom.",1390003200,18,5734,4.76056338028169

6141871,4,B00H91LWBY,"A Touch of Sin (2013 release from China; 130 min.) is intended to bring a critical look at modern day China. As the movie opens, we see three young guys who attempt to rob a motorbike riders. Unbeknownst to the three, that biker happens to be a bad dude carrying a gun. The bike rider ends up shooting two of the robbers-wannabes dead before the third one flees. Later, we get to know Dahai, a guy who challenges the Village Chief of Chongqing (a major city in SW China) for selling the public coal mine for an Audi A6, and other cronies of the Village Chief. Eventually Dahai is pushed over the edge. After this, three more stories follow, and to tell you much more about them would do you a disservice, youll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, I didn't realize going in that, as it turns out, the movie is really a collection of 4 independent stories, all of which have one common thread: the protagonist is at a certain point pushed over the (mental) edge, and we get to see how each of these protagonists deals with that. Second, I also didn't know going in that, as it turns out, all four of these stories are based on true events, at least that is what the trailer of the movie says (the trailer is one of the bonus materials which I watched after seeing the movie). Third, there is no such thing as independent movie making in China, as any and all movies are vetted and approved by the relevant Chinese authorities. Doesnt mean that one cannot produce a movie that offers a critical look at Chinas current society, as is the case with A Touch of Sin. But do understand that it is done in a way that gets (tacit) approval from the authorities. Last but certainly not least, the movie shrewdly exposes the seemingly emptiness, or shallowness, of Chinas current society. At one point we see a group of youngsters first discussing a horrible mining disaster resulting in many lives lost, and later on the exposure of a corrupt government official who is found to have 130 Louis Vutton bags in her office. Watch the reaction of the youngsters on both of these events! Just chilling.

Bottom line: this is an ambitious movie that mostly succeeds. It offers a nice glimpse into the mindset of todays materialistic-oriented society in China. If you are in the mood for a quality foreign film that challenges you and makes you think, you cannot go wrong with this. A Touch of Sin is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1424995200,5,2446,4.49438202247191

6141875,4,B00H91LWBY,"This is a film about modern China. It is essentially four stories told one after the other that are linked, but they are not inextricably linked like say the plot of `Amores Perros'. Also they are all about acts of violence - that being the common denominator. The portmanteau approach is one that needs careful crafting and to a great extent there is evidence of that here from director Zhangke Jia - who brought us `Still Life'.

The first story for me was possibly the strongest involving localised corruption, naked greed and all the trappings of needing to `save face'. We also have a nice dose of righteous retribution. Other stories involve a drifter, a brothel and also a fair bit of animal cruelty. There is not a lot on show here to advertise modern China as a must go to destination. That said it is very well acted, beautifully shot and clearly well directed. It runs to 130 minutes and I did feel it could have been shorter, but that might be just me. It is Cantonese, Mandarin and a bit of English with ok sub titles.

Hard to say I liked this ne, there was so much nastiness and cruelty, but that was the point of the film and at time the observational quality of the film(s) makes it feel like a documentary and at others it is clearly contrived. So a mixed bag on offer here but still a worthy effort and if you like modern Chinese films then you could do a lot worse than this.",1411257600,4,1395,4.361538461538461
