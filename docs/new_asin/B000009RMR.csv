7905650,5,B000009RMR,"I think that I saw all the episodes about three times when I was a kid and every time I use to watch it was like watching it for the first time. I would get hooked on it and dream about being a veritech pilot. It lead me to wonderful world of imagination that I had not explored before. I wish they would show it on TV again. For those of you who wonder about where to get the video, you should know that two robotech dvd's are coming out on May 22, 2001 with the first 12 episodes of the series. I can't wait for them to come out and buy them and hopefully the other episode will come out too later on.",985219200,2,603,3.870967741935484
7905651,5,B000009RMR,Let's get started here I was about 6 years old when robotech came out. I remember making my dad record it every morning on to the old school beta dang we have come a long way...LOL.  To me this is what inspired me to become a Navy tomcat pilot for the past five years..  The grapic's are the best the plot kept you on the edge of your seat.  The fight scenes where the best along with minma... Who I still to this day Have the biggest crush on...  Any ways top notch the best ever made by far... If anyone Has the macross series on VHS or DVD or know's where i can buy it please e-mail me..,981590400,,590,3.9327731092436973
7905652,5,B000009RMR,"First of all, as everybody knows, it is Roy Folker, not Roy Hunter.  My brother and I used to watch the original Robotech every morning.  My brother used to drag me out of bed (as a seven year old, I hated this) to watch this weird but wonderful show.  I learned to appreciate it on a higher level years later when we were able to buy some of the original volumes on VHS.  The original cast, including Rick, Roy, Claudia, Lisa, Max, Captain Gloval, etc. was far superior to the later shows, featuring whacked-out, incoherent, stupid plots with worthless casts of aliens and other assorted deadbeats.  Any help on finding the complete collection of episodes on either VHS or DVD would be much appreciated.",975628800,3,704,4.645161290322581
7905653,5,B000009RMR,"Robotech is an excellent cartoon. Even though I've watched it on numerous occasions, I still gasp in agony when Roy Hunter is killed, watch with baited breath when Daina Sterling for the first time transforms her hover tank into a battleloid and tremble with fear at the ambush of Scott's group by a team of Invids. All round fantastic ...",974073600,,339,4.666666666666667
7905654,5,B000009RMR,"I was 16 years old when I watched the entire Robotech Series (okay,I admit it) I used to come back from school running so I could turn on the TV on time and watch it. This is the best cartoon I ever watched and I would love to own the videos,if you are looking for a good story,good caracters,good animation,good everything,I strongly recomend ROBOTECH!!!.",970012800,2,356,4.578125

7905656,5,B000009RMR,"I was probably in the fifth grade when the Robotech series made its debut onto my otherwise dreary afternoon cartoon slate. I recall distinctly how  great the animation was, and how mature the level of the storytelling was.  This was clearly a saga intended for a more sophisticated audience, unlike  the lame ""Transformers"" and ""G.I. Joe"" that were its  contemporaries.
As an animated series, it was able to do what no  live-action series could do, and did what no other animated series (see  ""Transformers"" and ""G.I. Joe"") dared to go. Massive  battles were fought, and the combatants actually killed and maimed each  other. Characters were complex, revealing sometimes conflicting emotions  and motives, unlike most other children's shows where good guys were good  guys, and bad guys were bad, plain and simple.
It saddened me greatly the  day when my local station took it off the air, citing complaints by parents  that it was ""too violent."" The saga does not revel in the  violence and warfare, it incorporates it into the larger story of the  struggle for Earth and the extraterrestrial technology that was never  supposed to belong to the humans.",967507200,3,1155,5.005263157894737
7905657,5,B000009RMR,"I can remember seeing the whole series on television back in the days.. It has all, action, mystery, and romance. It is like a soap opera, where you can actually feel for the characters..exellent animation. It is not like  any other cartoon... each episode is continued to the next day. I can't  wait to own all of the series. and to think, there are even more episodes  that were never seen on t.v., the studio never purchased..I highly  recomened this series to die hard japanees animation fans!",962150400,5,497,4.67816091954023

7905659,5,B000009RMR,"An anime epic, worthy of the celluloid it's stored upon.
If ever you find the series, GET IT!",951091200,5,93,4.222222222222222
