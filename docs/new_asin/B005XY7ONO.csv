8488928,5,B005XY7ONO,"I don't think there is a more fun type of music than swing, the only music peppy enough to get a war torn world from the 1940s up and dancing.

It's even more fun to DANCE swing!
I took a few ballroom and tango lessons many, many years ago, way before Dancing with the Stars was even conceived. Loved it, but lessons are expensive, and keeping appointments has never been a strong point.
Other than a few (and I mean VERY few) basics, little is remembered from those lessons.

This DVD has you off the couch and dancing before you know it! The instructors are easy to follow, you see each step broken down slowly.
If you've never danced a step before, this is truly the way to go.

Give a copy to each member of your wedding party, or have a group 'dance class'. The DVD shows how even just a few easy steps can have you dancing and lookin' swell, Daddy-O!
