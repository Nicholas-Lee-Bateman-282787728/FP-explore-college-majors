7895721,2,6305794448,"Star Carter Wong and director Joseph Kuo team up once again for ostensibly the third of three installments of the 18 Bronzemen.  While Bronzemen 1 and Bronzemen 2 are heavily laden with 18 Bronzemen confrontations and trips through the cavernous chamber of Bronzemen in spectacular satisfyling choreography and attentive to the mystique and pageantry of the Bronzemen themself, this film seems like the odd man out.  The story and characters are different, but thats OK.  But after a brief set-up, Carter Wong is in and out of the 18 Bronzemen chamber for good (and he's succussful on the first try) in about 10 minutes in the first 20 minutes of the film.  He must ""endure"" a grand total of about FOUR skills.  After this walk in the park, he even earns the coveted honor of carrying out the big burning urn.  Whaaaaaah?  His bronzemen fights are clumsily and choppily edited without even the gratuitous walking through corridors from one chamber to another.  A movie fan who has seen alot of these films would clearly suspect that the whole ""bronzemen"" sequence came from ""outtakes"" from the previous 2 films.  The bronzemen seqeunce is treated almost dismissively.  The remainder of the film deals with the newly disciplined Shaolin student RESISTING challenge after challenge from rival kung-fu masters.  Whaaaaaah?  This occupies the middle two-thirds of the film.  Sound entertaining?  Predictably, he does take on the masters in the end in enlivened somewhat satisfying, yet non-memorable, fight seqeunces.  So in the end, this is a barely passable Carter Wong flick with some nothing-new fighting of 18 Bronzemen spuriously, shamelessly, and briefly thrown into the film, adding little to the substance or content of the core film.",988675200,2,1739,5.117021276595745
7895722,3,6305794448,"Like the other 2 the bronzemen only appear for a short while, not really being a big part of the story line.  In this film Carter Wong (star of the  previous 2) plays a young man who has traind for many years after being  dropped off by a dying family friend. His father was a great fighter and  had many enemies including the 8 masters, who wished to gain revenge on him  by killing his family.  After mastering all that the monks of shaolin could  teach him, he had to test the bronzemen before being able to leave the  temple and repay the man who saved his life.  Once stepping foot back out  into society he is again hunted by the 8 masters who still want to fulfill  there revenge promise, and a girl who may be more bad then good.  Great  action as Carter Wong must defend his family name against the 8 kung fu  master clan. good film, i think better then the first.  more like 3 3/4  stars.",967334400,,898,4.16374269005848
