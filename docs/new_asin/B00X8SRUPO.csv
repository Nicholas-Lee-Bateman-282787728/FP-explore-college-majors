7166658,4,B00X8SRUPO,I LOVE THIS SHOW and have watched the first two seasons again over the summer. I am giving Season 3 just 4 stars because there are NO EXTRAS! I thought they would at least include On The Record 2 but at first glance it does not appear to be included. i'm bummed! Bloopers? Music videos? Gotta be SOMETHING they could have tacked on . . .,1441152000,9,337,4.121212121212121

7166660,5,B00X8SRUPO,"great cast and good storylines. a serious soapy drama from the country perspective. my favorite pairing is jeff and layla for their complex not so simple, not so sweet but they love each other anyway love story. i hope that the show continues to expand upon them as they are the perfect non cookie cutter couple. so far the show has not followed traditional suit and has written for them without making the storyline predictable but thinking outside the box. for that nashville season 3 earns five stars.",1440374400,,504,4.738636363636363

7166691,3,B00X8SRUPO,"I do love this show about Nashville, although I must admit that this is today's Nashville with nothing about the Nashville of yesteryear that had real stars that lasted for 20, 30, 50 years, not one or two hit wonders like today's country music, and I like the music industry.

But two major problems with this set:

1) Not a single extra.  Season one and two had bloopers, at least one behind the scenes featurette and either a concert or some complete songs.  The show features about one verse of most songs, certainly not the complete songs on DVD.  Yeah, I know you can buy CD/s of the songs, but this is a tv show this is visual.

2) No mention of the cast, except for Connie Britton and Hayden Panettiere on the cover and other than the episode titles, no other information like a one or two sentence synopsis of the episode nor the air date, like so many tv show box sets have.

Lionsgate and abc studios are doing their fans no great treats in this bare bones DVD.",1467936000,2,972,4.337016574585635

7166709,5,B00X8SRUPO,"Season 3 continued with the great character driven story lines of the first two seasons. Rayna and Luke's employees are pretty much planning every aspect of their lives, this doesn't bother Luke so much but Rayna isn't liking it much. I liked how in this season we see a lot more of Layla Grant, (Aubrey Peeples) and she has better music to perform than the idol type stuff of previous seasons. She becomes a much more interesting character as we see more of her on screen than in the past. Will is also struggling with issues outside of the ones in their marriage.  Juliette takes her diva behaviour to new heights but the writers did very well in how they included an in real life pregnant Hayden Panettierre into the fictional Juliette Barnes world.  Lesser writers would have just diminished the actress' role or changed her character, but you'll love what the writers do in Season 3.  Gunner receives a huge surprise, as does Deacon who as always doesn't really handle it well. Of course Scarlett has her own opinions on both men's lives.  Avery grows as a person and they threw in some new characters too, one of which has to deal with domestic violence which will draw in a few of our favourite characters.

The songs overall I think are better in this season than the last.  They do repeat a few songs with some of the characters but in real life music stars would have to.  I wish Rayna's daughters could together sing something different to the one they've already sung countless times before.  Season 3 is another great season, and well worth binge watching on DVD.  Looking forward to Season 4 whenever it is released on DVD.",1456704000,2,1637,4.597938144329897

7166724,4,B00X8SRUPO,"+++Warning...this will contain spoilers from prior seasons, but no major giveaways from season 3.  If you have not seen the prior seasons proceed with caution+++

The third season of Nashville very much keeps the prime time soap opera feel that the show has had.  The focus is, of course still on the various relationships between the various characters, romantic and otherwise.

The Rayna, Deacon Jeff Wheeler triangle continues throughout the season, and is, to some extent resolved.  But the season finale ends on a major cliffhanger (again) involving Deacon and Rayna.

Will is still struggling with his sexuality, keeping up appearances with his fake marriage to Layla which sends her into a tailspin, which makes for one of the very good ancillary story lines of the season.  Will's story line is really about how it is becoming harder and harder to keep the secret.

Hayden Panettiere's role was a bit reduced this season because of her real life pregnancy, which ultimately got written into the show.  While she was very involved in the show, there were some episodes where she made one or two brief appearances while her character was in bed.  Toward the end of the season her story line picks up again as she struggles with motherhood and the issues of her own childhood and mother that we saw in the first season.

The other big story line of the season Involved Teddy.  It took a while for the show to give him something to do, but his arc is in the background of the larger season cliff hanger, and his future is very much up in the air.  Scarlett and Gunnar also have the will they/won't they story that they had last year, but it gets closer to being resolved this season, but with many complications for both of them.

The breakout star of the show this year was Oliver Husdon's Jeff Fordham character.  He really took over the role of the smarmy bad guy that was left open when Powers Boothe left the show.  He has his fingers in almost every other story line of the season, and plays the out for himself role perfectly.

For those who get the DVD set, it is bare bones, episodes only.  No bonus material, which sucks for the price you are paying.  So unless you are getting the DVDs to add to an existing collection, streaming the show is fine because you are not getting anything more.",1448323200,4,2304,4.602941176470588
