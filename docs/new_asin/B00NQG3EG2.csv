6677957,5,B00NQG3EG2,"This film was good. As far as drinking a beer n watching a good horror this would be that movie. Adam in my opinion has is a great film maker, and can't wait to see more from him.",1424822400,2,179,3.736842105263158
6677958,5,B00NQG3EG2,"If you're looking for a fresh approach to the world of horror, you need look no further.  Mr. Ahlbrandt delivers a very strong film and captures what I truly enjoy about the paranormal,  while never letting the viewer get ahead of the action.  Kept me thinking while watching and long after it was over, the sign of a true quality film.",1424736000,2,336,4.475409836065574
6677959,5,B00NQG3EG2,"Great independent film. Bloody, sexy, evil. I've enjoyed all of Adam's work so far (crew included), and with a few new ones on the horizon, he is one to keep a eye on.",1424390400,2,167,4.090909090909091
6677960,5,B00NQG3EG2,"If you like very stylish, gory and demonic horror, you should give The Cemetery a chance. This release from Massacre Video is top-notch and is a great addition to their already diverse library.",1424390400,2,193,4.878787878787879
6677961,5,B00NQG3EG2,"As far as indie productions go Mr. Ahlbrandt and his team have put together some very fine films.  Most have said they prefer The Cemetery however I cannot agree...Crossbearer is by far my favorite of his.  But anywho back to the Cemetery.  This movie is definitely not ""a bag full of cocks"" as one very insightful reviewer once wrote.  And neither is this just another Evil Dead rip off as many call it.  Does it have comparisons?  Absolutely and so what?!  I will never ever understand people who get tired of whatever type of movie whether it be zombies, slashers, remakes(they've remade movie ideas since the 20's it's never going to stop :p)
  Not all of the acting was up to par but Natalie Jean was in my opinion more than where she needed to be and J.D. Brown was also very good and a tremendous addition to the cast as he was in Ahlbrandt's Crossbearer.  The fx were gory and well placed in every scene.  Not an abundance of over used cgi like most low budget films nowadays.  The music and sound effects were one of the best parts of the film.  Adam's sound effects are always very cool between decapitations and hacking up other parts of different bodies hahahaha.  The story is pretty simple a group of young people head into the woods to shoot a paranormal show of sorts about an old cemetery where a lot of really bad stuff happed.  Torture, mayhem, gore, possessed people running around looking for victims.  Great movie.  I've watched it more than a couple times.  Adam really has an eye for indie filmmaking and I can't wait for his next one.",1424390400,4,1559,4.507142857142857
6677962,3,B00NQG3EG2,We love horror movies and this was fair. We usually watch the worst so it may  entertain others better.,1424217600,4,103,4.421052631578948
6677963,3,B00NQG3EG2,"A tad bit hyped.  I enjoyed parts of this film, but it's still Evil Dead in the woods.  We've seen this movie a billion times, only this time add fun death metal, nudity, and interesting flashbacks.  I'll admit I was a bit letdown overall.  Not terrible, but not great.  Better low budget effort up against its counterparts.  Not worth paying over twenty bucks.",1421193600,12,361,4.650793650793651
6677964,5,B00NQG3EG2,"This movie has it all, great acting, great direction, gore and a awesome soundtrack. If you love a great horror movie you have got to pick this up. You will not be disappointed. Hands down in the top five horror movies this year. Be sure to check out all of Adam's other work not only is he a talented film maker but he is a great guy.",1415577600,5,335,4.014925373134329
8679809,2,B00NQG3EG2,"A simple quick review is all that's necessary here.  About every 8th word in the dialog was F'in.  A sure sign that the movie is B class or less.  Too much cartoonish blood and gore.  No suspense.  Not scary.  Why do creators of low budget movies depict such low life characters?  I'm grown and the F word doesn't impress me.  It's used so often today to try to make characters look ""adult"" that it just bores me and insults my intelligence.  The horror aspect would be more believable if the characters WERE decent people and acted horrified by tbe events.  Learn this writers and directors and make better horror movies.  This was trivial.",1458086400,,641,4.584070796460177
8679810,2,B00NQG3EG2,"Comparing this film to THE EVIL DEAD is really an insult to Sam Raimi and his crew. I bought this believing the other reviews about this film on Amazon and have to admit that I was a fool once again.

The much-mentioned gore are inter-cut flashback shots of tortured victims having their bowels torn out by demon-hunting priests, so if you are a fan of non-frightening scenes showing viscera (or still wish that you had taken that job at a slaughter house), you might like this. As for demons, forget the terrifying scenes in THE EVIL DEAD. The only demon here resembles a nearly naked hippy running around wearing poorly applied face make-up. As for the cemetery, the gravestones are shown only fleeting shots and are hardly center stage.

Since I paid for this DVD, I might watch it again just to see if I missed anything important (although I have my doubts).",1457308800,2,862,4.627450980392157

8679812,3,B00NQG3EG2,"Fun indy movie. Gore, nudity as what you expect from the director. The turn off for me was the metal soundtrack. I like the genre and it fits the horror world but I usually like ambient soundtracks with my horror but that's just me.",1448236800,2,232,4.295454545454546

8679815,3,B00NQG3EG2,"This is a decent low budget effort. The cast and acting were better than expected. Though the film is truly attempting to trod some much older ground like The Evil Dead movies. This is not nearly as good as any of the Sam Raimi Evil Dead 80s classics, but still worth a watch for genre fans. I saw the average review rating was 4.6 as of now and that's really too high for this film but worth a look.",1434326400,2,400,4.075949367088608
8679816,3,B00NQG3EG2,"Better than expected riff on the old ""people go into the woods and find trouble"" plot. Here a gang of motley (and horny) filmmakers trot out to a haunted cemetery and discover that, yes, it is indeed a bad place to go. Pretty standard as far as things go, but an ""Evil Dead 2"" performance as an over-the-top slut channeling Bruce Campbell elevates this film over the usual unimaginative fare of its ilk. Micro cinema done right.",1432944000,2,428,4.571428571428571
8679817,5,B00NQG3EG2,"Adam Ahlbrandt's ""The Cemetery"" is a great film of fans of gore.  Check it out!",1431993600,,79,4.266666666666667
