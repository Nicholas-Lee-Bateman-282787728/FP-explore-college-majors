2867941,4,B000RIWASK,This is a good workout that makes great use of the resistance band.  I didn't think the leg section was as challenging as the abs and arms segment but overall it was a decent workout.  I would recommend for lighter days.,1189555200,,220,4.341463414634147
2867942,5,B000RIWASK,"Amy Bento's workouts are consistently top-notch, and this one is no exception. Whether your a beginner or advanced, 10 Minute Solution: Tone Trouble Zones will provide you with a solid, well-rounded workout.

As owner of Advanced Workouts, I've been in the fitness industry for over fifteen years, and am at a very advanced fitness level. Even so, I found this workout quite challenging. Working your muscles in a variety of different ways that traditional free weight training cannot provide, the use of the resistance band will create that much sought-after ""muscle confusion"" to help fuel and propel your fitness level no matter your degree of fitness training. You'll break through plateaus and create more lean muscle.

In addition, Amy's typical personable attitude and encouragement makes this DVD enjoyable and motiviational. A must-have for my immense exercise DVD library, for sure!",1187913600,25,892,5.364285714285714
2867943,5,B000RIWASK,"This is another fantastic workout from 10 Minute Solution.  There's no excuse for not doing some form of workout when there are these kinds of workouts on the market.  This particular dvd is really good and will definately help to get rid of your trouble zones.
Each of the segments uses a resistance band to help you sculpt various areas of your body - you get a 6 foot band with the dvd.  When you change your hold on the band, you get different intensity with every move you do.  You can make up your own routine by mixing up the order in which you play this.  There is the usual upper body, lower body, abs, arms and shoulders and a complete body segment.  Amy is a brilliant instructor who is enthusiastic and encouraging, but not annoying.  She cues really well and that just makes this whole workout that much better.
If you are short on time, then this is for you.  You can do either 10 minutes alone or join a couple of segments together to get a longer workout.  You will have to combine this with some cardio, but I can't recommend this highly enough because of the fun factor and the fact you can fit this in on any day.  I love it.",1187740800,96,1144,4.25462962962963
2867944,5,B000RIWASK,"This dvd will really banish your trouble zones.  The band give extra resistance to the exercises and the moves are unique, which makes doing it fun.  The instructer is good, she is motivating without being irritating.  I love how I can design my own workout and if I am short on time can do one or more depending on my schedule.  This is a great addition to my collection and I highly recommend it!",1186617600,25,398,4.337837837837838
2867945,2,B000RIWASK,"The videos involve sequences of complex movements that are not explained, and are switched up frequently.  There is no time to figure out each movement before the instructor is three moves further on.  I like the concept of the resistance band, but the workout was just to complicated to follow in a short amount of time.",1483747200,,321,4.714285714285714

2867947,4,B000RIWASK,"The workout itself is good but negatives are as follows:
*I do not like the warm. She changes what she is doing very often and very quickly. I don't have time to do all the moves so I just stick to the two I like and repeat.
*I know there is a time constraint but on some moves you need more time to set the band up so you miss some moves.
Overall though, I would do some of these again but I may pick another workout more often than not.",1473811200,,438,3.8241758241758244

Tried soaking it in soapy water to get the horrific smell off of it and now the band sticks to itself. What's the point of using this DVD if the band isn't working the way it should!

2867969,5,B000RIWASK,"This is an effective and fun workout - my favorite is the stretch sequence, which is so relaxing.  I find that I can fit this in easily even at the end of a long day.  It's not repetitive, like some workouts, and the time goes by fast.  Love this instructor!",1449446400,,258,4.12
2867970,5,B000RIWASK,Great workout video that comes with the bands too! I enjoy all the workouts and love that if I want to focus on one part of my body I can do that. These short 10 minute workouts will have you sweating just a little and get your heart rate up. They are easy enough to do and she doesn't go too fast doing them either. I would recommend this for a beginner who is just getting started on working out.,1448064000,,398,3.9875
2867971,4,B000RIWASK,Love this dvd by Amy Bento for a quick workout. Just challenging enough on the days when you really can't hit it hard. Compact and portable exercise for travel.,1438473600,,160,4.551724137931035
2867972,5,B000RIWASK,"I really liked the workout pace. I was glad to see that the arms workout and butt/thigh workout were close together. Again, the pace was great amd easy to follow. I was able to modify and use my flex bands for the arms workout, but not for the butt and thigh workout. I will however buy the bands so I can do the 10min total body workout before going to work.",1436745600,,359,4.070422535211268
2867973,3,B000RIWASK,I really liked this video I just started working out again and it was a can do video not those impossible videos you just drop on the floor and just will not try again. So I'm glad I bought this video.,1427587200,,201,3.926829268292683
2867974,5,B000RIWASK,Good video for high beginner and up. I love the fast pace and the workouts are pretty good with the bands. I bought higher resistance bands. I use the one with the video for some stretching/therapy stuff.,1426550400,,204,4.54054054054054
2867985,5,B000RIWASK,"I have a lot of exercise DVDs and I am unfamiliar with the 10 minute solution DVDs so I thought I would give them a try. I ordered two and after working out with this one, I think I'll be ordering more. This is an awesome workout DVD because it is broken down into several 10 minute workout segments. I love this format because it allows you to mix and match workouts. For those who don't have a lot of time to workout this DVD allows you to work out smarter. The band provides that extra resistance you need for a good workout in short amount of time and if you do have enough time you can do the entire video if you like. I did not find this video to be too difficult for me and the instructor was easy to understand and follow. I consider myself to be at an intermediate physical fitness level. I am reading a lot of reviews (about this DVD and other other 10 Minute Solution DVDs) that say that the instructor went too fast or it was too challenging. For people who think it's moving too fast, she does switch positions quickly because it's only a 10 minute video! Would these people prefer that she pause for 2 of the 10 minutes for the viewers to get into position? If so, these are the same people who would complain that this DVD was not a good value because the instructor wasted too much time. There are not many exercise DVDs that allow enough time to get into the proper position so the solution to that is to pause or rewind it. If that is a deal breaker for you then you will not like this DVD. For those people who say that this video is too challenging - this is an easy fix, you can modify any exercise to make it easier for you. I recommend this video to people who like the 10 minute mix and match format.",1421193600,,1724,4.133928571428571
2867986,5,B000RIWASK,"Great video for beginners! I have been out of the exercise scene for awhile due to having my daughter. This video was a great way to get me back in the swing of things and I definitely was sore the next day. I like that I was able to customize my workout, and do it MY way. I was able to do it for as short as 10 minutes if I didn't have a lot of time, and I could do it for as long as an hour. This video worked well with my schedule and the exercise band folded nicely back in the DVD case. Very easy storage!",1420416000,,511,3.697247706422018

2867988,5,B000RIWASK,"I enjoy these exercises and results come really soon, I feel stronger.  Main menu allows to select which rutines you want to follow, so daily rutine depends on you. It is not boring and they are easy to perform.",1417737600,,211,4.410256410256411
2867989,4,B000RIWASK,Quick and efficient. A bit fast paced. I wouldn't recommend this if you don't catch on quickly or like moving at a fast pace.,1410393600,,125,4.25
2867990,1,B000RIWASK,It was too sporadic and jumped from one set to another without giving you time to reposition yourself.  The exercises were not cohesive (that is making a natural progression from one exercise to another).  It felt very amateurish.  I have used exercise videos for years and this is the worst I have viewed.!,1409961600,3,307,4.754716981132075
2867991,4,B000RIWASK,"I got this for a friend who is time challenged (as am I) but also tried all the workouts out.  Amy Bento does a great job here.  She's clear and the exercises with the band work well.  It gives your workout a focus.

Here's how to get the most of the DVD:

1) Do more than 1 workout - 10 minutes might be too short.  I did all in one session and it worked fine.

2) If you're not as fit, slow it down.  One some DVD players, you can work this at half speed.  Obviously, the sound will be affected, but not a bad idea if you're really new to working out and need to catch up.  Otherwise, you might be hitting the pause button often.

3) Get more elastic bands - they will eventually break.  An Elastic band is included with the DVD, and what I recommend is buying spares.  These bands are NOT designed to last.  I've owned a few before and they will eventually snap (still usable depending on where they snap).  Under heat and certain conditions, the rubber will wear out.  The good news is they're relatively cheap and easy to replace.

4) Get Different Resistance Grades of Bands:  The band that comes with this is relatively easy and quite flexible for use.  If you're stronger or need more resistance, get different grades on hand and use them as needed.  Substituting dumbbells for some exercises is also a good option.

Overall, this is a very compact exercise - you don't need a lot of room to work it.  But as my trainer would say - get your cardio in.  Enjoy.",1409875200,,1467,4.254545454545455
2867992,5,B000RIWASK,"I absolutely owe alot to this dvd. I started taking my health more seriously and did what worked best for me: I decided to run 1-3 miles every day, about 45 min, and to use workouts dvds, about 30 min, to supplement, since I don't like going to and paying for a gym (tried it, doesn't stick, having to go somewhere to exercise seems pointless and time consuming, especially when I discovered the right dvds). So after using this regiment with this dvd, I saw a huge improvement. I'm 28 yrs old and I went from 140 lbs to 116 lbs! I've never looked better. The best parts of this dvd are:
1) the arm workout. My arms are lean and tone, without looking too buff or thick. That workout hurts, you really feel it and it really shows. It works the tricep, the hard area, very well. I would buy this JUST for that regime, if nothing else. It's worth it. The other workouts are intense too. You get used to the pacing pretty quickly. It's not too fast. The point of it is to use the dvd so much that you already know what the next move is. Don't give up or get frustrated! Go a bit slower if it's too fast at first because at some point, you'll be thinking she's going too slow! :)
2) The 10 minute aspect is great. Fast, no excuse to not do it, and it's so short, you can add in a few other workouts too!
3) You can queue up workouts in the order you want and how many you want so you don't have to keep running to your remote control to play a different clip. You can keep your heart rate up. Genius!
4) The resistance band that comes with the dvd is resilient. I've had it for over a year and going! No rips and it still has great tension. The magic of the band is the tighter you wrap it around your hands , the harder it works your muscles. It's amazing how it tones your body, especially your arms.

For the price and the band and the arm workout, this is a must buy! I also recommend Brazil Butt and Jillian Michaels Abs dvds. Reshaped my entire body within 2 months!",1408838400,8,1967,4.095854922279793

I do a lot of heavy lifting at work, so lifting weights when I get home isn't always a good idea.  I still feel like I'm getting a workout in with the bands, without hurting myself with weights.  I also love the 10 Minute Solution format.  I'll usually do about 3 segments, but it doesn't feel like a half hour of torture.  It seems to go faster then other 30 min workouts.  I recommend this for anyone who wants to strength train, but have a bad back or other issues.",1401580800,,554,4.219047619047619

Tried one of Jane Fonda's, and while I love her, Fit and Strong is really geared for people who are older and more sedentary than me. Tried a cardio hip hop one, and came away feeling uncoordinated and just plain frustrated (and I've been dancing all my life).
And then I hit on this one!
The instructor is so clear and presents everything so well, I found myself looking forward to the next 10 min....and the next 10...until I'd done all of them and just loved the final stretch.

I often use this one as an add on to my cardio workout, so that I can get some quick and simple strength training in. It is also a very good solution for strength training while traveling because the strechy band is very portable.

I would not necessarily use this DVD as your primary strength training method, but it is a nice addition to any fitness library, especially if you are looking for something that is portable or that gives you the flexibility of choosing a short, medium, or long workout.

In addition, the instructor is clear and motivational without being too cheery, and the moves are easy to learn.",1341273600,,822,4.585034013605442

2868035,5,B000RIWASK,"I came to know Amy Bento's workout style from the ""Blast Off Belly Fat"" DVD (the one with the red cover).  There are two ""Blast Off Belly Fat"" DVD's; however, the one with the blue cover only features Suzanne Bowen as the instructor while the one with the red cover has varying instructors, including Suzanne.

With regard to this video, as with most of the reviewers, she does move VERY quickly between each move.  However, she does let you know ahead of time how many sets, and counts it down so you're aware of when it's going to change up.  I was caught a bit off guard at first, but after about 3 mins into the first routine, I was fine.  It just takes getting used to.  I would also suggest buying another power band.  The one that they offer with this video (the same one they offer with their other DVD's), tangles very quickly.  It  takes time to get it undone and THAT can contribute to slowing you down with a routine that moves as quickly as Amy's.  A suggestion:  I bought a nice power band by Giam that doesn't bunch up or tangle anywhere near as much as this power band.

I enjoy the DVD a lot.  I own this one and Suzanne Bowen's Pilates DVD with power band.  They're both similar in that both DVDs have an arm routine, buns/thighs routine, abs routine, total body and a stretch.  The difference is that, as you can imagine, one uses the Pilates method while the other is more traditional workout moves.  I like them both, but I have to admit that I am more of a strength training individual (i.e. a female who likes using weights) than I am a Pilates type.  I do enjoy Pilates; however, I am not overly flexible and I am more muscular so I am more inclined to go with the power band routine that is more like strength training.

Regardless, you won't go wrong with either one.  It's more a preference in your workout style.  And I know this is supposed to be a review about Amy Bento's routine, so let me punctuate this by saying once you get used to her method and style, ""Buy it.  You won't be disappointed.""",1318896000,,2027,4.309523809523809

2868038,4,B000RIWASK,"I just recently got rid of my gym membership in an effort to save some money and so I have been stocking up on workout DVD's and stumbled across the 10 minute solution series. This DVD got pretty good ratings and I liked the idea of using a resistance band, so I bought this one. I like the energy of the instructor and she cues well and explains everything really well, but she goes SO fast! The first time I tried it I had to keep pausing the video over and over again so that I could catch up to her!  The exercises are great though- you can really feel the burn, it's just going to take me a few times to get the exercises down and get used to the pace of the video. I would suggest that you watch the video before working out to it the first time- this will allow you to have an idea of what to be prepared for. My favorite part was the stretching segment at the end- the band really helps to take the stretching up a notch and she goes MUCH slower, so you can actually keep up with her. Overall, I think this is a nice addition to my rotation and I would recommend it to others.",1312156800,,1084,3.9953917050691246
2868039,3,B000RIWASK,"Amy Bento is a good at combination moves so you get the most out of your time, however she moves too quickly from one exercise to the next...there is not enough time to get the band in place.  Also, there is no instruction on proper form, therefore beginners will struggle.  People who have been exercising with a band will probably like this one.  Beginners or people who have not exercised in a while should start out slower,and with an instructor who teaches you how to perform the moves in order to prevent injury. I have put this one on my ""try it again"" list for later.",1302307200,,575,4.40566037735849

I have tried purchasing other resistance band videos of which none came even close to the results/workout intensity as that video, until I found this video.  It's true she does change moves very quickly which can be difficult at first, but once you have done the video a few times you will appreciate that she doesn't take forever explaining the moves.  I did it this morning and was sweating and my muscles definitly feel like they got a good workout.  The nice thing about these videos is that you can increase the intensity by purchasing more intense resistance bands (just be sure to get the ones that are at least 6 ft long).  I highly recommend this video for anyone looking for a great at home workout!",1297814400,3,847,4.509803921568627

2868043,4,B000RIWASK,"I was looking for something to add variety to my strength workouts.  I've been doing Chalean Extreme three days a week for 6 months and just wanted something different to mix in.  This gives you a good workout (not as intense as Chalean,but good), you can tighten up on the bands to get the the right resistance for you and I like that she's incorporated some creative exercises to add interest.  If you have the right tension on the band and do the moves in good form, you'll really feel the workout even if you've been doing strength training for a while.  The ab workout was very good - I worked up a sweat the first time through.

I've done her workouts twice - not all of them each time and I found it pretty easy to get the bands right.  It's not an exact science, you don't have to have it positioned perfectly - so you can move through them quickly.  In the two times I've worked out, I only paused the DVD once to get the bands positioned and then it was because I had it on the wrong side of my foot.  That shouldn't happen more than a couple of times as I get familiar with the exercises.

Another good feature on the DVD is the ability to select the exercises you want, queue them up and it will move from one to the other without going back to the menu to select the next one.  They call this personalizing your workout.  Good idea.",1280275200,,1345,4.19455252918288

I usually do 2 segments every day and I can feel it when I'm done. However, I think if you are looking to loose weight or get your heart rate up this won't do much for you. The fact that it comes with the needed equipment (a body band) is a plus. The band is pretty light resistance but it is long enough that it can be doubled for more resistance. After a few times doing the workouts I had no trouble transitioning with the band from one excercise to another. As for Amy Bento, I don't find her as annoying, fake, intense, or peppy as alot of instructors.

2868059,5,B000RIWASK,I am 64 years old and not in the best or worst shape. I needed something to help me get started with stretching and then toning. This was perfect. 10 minutes was just enough in the beginning and now I frequently do 20-30 minutes depending on my schedule. I love the band. It allowed me to do the stretching and then the more difficult exercises without putting too much strain on my joints and muscles. It has reenergized me.,1252886400,,425,4.3924050632911396

The arm and leg sections are especially well-developed. The 10 Minute Stretch isn't particularly interesting, but it feels good. Amy Bento does sound a bit ""fake"" but at least she's peppy, not boring. The main problem is the speed. You should definitely preview this, but while you're watching, get into position with the band to figure out where it is most comfortable for you, so you don't have to scramble to rearrange yourself later.",1252800000,,606,4.836538461538462

2868062,5,B000RIWASK,"I think this might be my first review on Amazon!

I recently ordered this DVD after seeing a clip of it on another website and finding it interesting. I was a little bit worried about reviews I had read which claimed the transitions were too quick, etc. I liked the idea of the band but wondered if I might have trouble with it as I had tried using one before and it was not the most comfortable. But my greatest worry was that it would be another purchase that would end up collecting dust.

The first thing I will say is that in the short time since receiving it, I have probably exercised more often and more regularly than I have in years, which counts for a lot.

What I like about it:

1. The instructor.
The instructor and setting are always important factors in exercise videos. Amy Bento is pleasant, professional, and motivating in this. Her form is good in the moves she demonstrates and her explanation of them is clear. There are also parts where she asks you to breathe and emphasizes her own breathing, which adds to the reminder and helps you remain conscious of this part we sometimes forget.

2. The routine
It really is great that the segments are only 10 minutes, and the customizing option is great. You can select one or as many of the routines as you want and it will play out in the order you choose. I try to pick three (including the stretching segment) and alternate every second day or so. Even on days when I have been very tired, I told myself I would do just one and ended up doing more. I also like how each segment begins with a warm-up and ends with a stretch. These are fairly quick but are nice to have. With regard to the transitions, I would say that watching the segment at least once is very helpful. I did so myself and initially could understand what some people meant. The warm-up is often quick as she goes from one move to the next, and it could be hard to follow the first time around simply because you are not familiar with it. But don't let this scare you. It is not complicated and once you know what to expect, it is fine. With time, you will also get used to changing the band with each exercise without falling behind, and holding it in the best way to get the most out of the exercises. It may not be ideal but the first time or two, you can press pause if needed to get adjusted. I have done this occasionally (I kept the remote close by) but it did not prevent me from enjoying it and getting a good workout. So though it might feel quick at first, the routine in its entirety is not rushed. I honestly feel the routine is productive and interesting and makes great use of its time. There is certainly no time wasted.

3. The band
It is great that the DVD comes with the band. The band is a good length and you can tighten it if necessary. It is a piece of equipment that offers good resistance and helps with certain exercises and does not take up a lot of space.

I have struggled to make exercise a more regular part of my life and so far, this DVD has really helped. I am so pleased it was not a purchase to have gone unused.",1251936000,5,3085,4.21864406779661
2868063,4,B000RIWASK,"This is a great way to get some strength training in especially if you haven't been active for awhile. I like that the sessions are done in 10 minute increments. This way you can break your routine up based on how busy your daily schedule is. Also, you can easily target areas that you may consider your problem areas. Another plus is that the DVD comes with a band and you can use that instead of purchasing weights. Bet you're thinking ""how effective is a band"". It is very effective. You will feel the resistance as if you were using actual weights. I always feel my muscles tightening as I do the workouts. Nothing painful. More like the burn that you hear instructors speak of. Finally, the instructor is encouraging. She appears to enjoy the workouts as she does them. I also feel that her routines are pretty easy to pick up. I normally watch exercise workouts at least once to get an idea of what I will be doing. Give it a try. You may like it.",1251676800,,953,4.359550561797753

2868065,2,B000RIWASK,This 10 minute solution DVD is very fast and hyper-active for me.  she goes to fast that I couldn't keep up with her.

I love the 10 minutes solution workouts but this is not one of my favs.,1240272000,2,333,3.8676470588235294

Here I would like to mention that I am not new to workout DVDs and I have been pretty regular with a couple of them in the past (one was Karen Voight) - even got results that I was happy with. I wanted to try something new and ordered three - this being one of them. I ended up disliking all three of my new choices (the two others were by Tami Lee and Denise Austin, respectively).

Well, I had to get another cardio type video and got this one. I have enjoyed it greatly. It is quick pace but you do get a lot done in a short amount of time. The instructor does use some interesting moves that I have not seen in other videos and I enjoyed that part.

Minus one star because she moves into the next moves quickly and it can tricky to do at times with the band. But once you get used to the sequence it shouldn't be a problem.

I have two modifications, however. During the arm and shoulder routine you do what I call a swimming shoulder raise (which I think is the best exercize for the shoulders I've seen) followed by tricep kickbacks. There just isn't enough tension in the band for the kickbacks. Instead, set up like the Bi-Tri exercize in the Total Body Section, and follow the Shoulder Swim with One Arm Tricep Overhead Presses, like she follows the Bicep Curls. The combination shoulder-tricep burn is perfect, and the resistance needed for both exercizes is the same

Modification two, instead of finishing with Tricep Pushups, just max out with regular Pushups. Sorry, but that was a dumb use of the band. One, why do resisted pushups on your knees, when you can go to your toes, and two, there is no chest exercize in the workout, even though there are back exercizes. You gotta work your chest girls. Do you know what your pec muscles hold up? Strong pecs = ""Perky""!

After making two modifications, why Five Stars? because Amy Bento is the best workout video instructor I've seen! No whoops, no cheerleading, but good, solid instruction. She had me when she said, ""One more, please"". Plus she doesn't say ""Press"", when you're not pressing, like all the others do! That is my biggest peeve of workout videos.

BUY THIS VIDEO!!",1204761600,6,1497,4.616541353383458
2868118,4,B000RIWASK,This is a great workout for someone who is mom like me and is short on time. Amy Bento is very good at explaining how to do each exercise and has a good personalty that isn't over the top like other instructors. The workout doesn't leave you exhausted but energized and ready to take on the day! I would highly recommend it!,1203724800,5,324,4.241935483870968
2868119,5,B000RIWASK,This DVD is my favorite. Amy Bento is an excellent instructor and makes it so much fun. The exercises works and actually not that hard to follow. A must buy! I am a beginner and working out with this video makes it fun and I can feel it works.,1203292800,5,243,3.979591836734694
2868120,5,B000RIWASK,This is my new favorite workout dvd! It is so easy to follow and gives a great workout in just 10 minutes. I love the results!,1203206400,,126,3.8846153846153846
2868121,5,B000RIWASK,"This is an Awesome Dvd for my Pilates classes ... i saw some new moves w/the band that i hadn't tried before.. thanks for always having new and different Dvds to buy to vary my classes, so they aren't getting bored. Karen",1203120000,,221,4.285714285714286
2868122,5,B000RIWASK,"This is a very good quick excercise DVD.  I didn't try to keep up at first just concentrated on learning the moves correctly.  Now it's a snap. I mix up the different zones to keep my workout to 20 min., fun and alive.",1202860800,3,218,4.046511627906977
2868123,4,B000RIWASK,"I'm pretty sedentary because I work at a computer all day, though I do walk and garden whenever I can.  So I'd probably rate myself as a beginning exerciser.  This DVD and accompanying band give me a nice stretch/wake-up if I just do a 10-minute routine, and an exhausting (in a good way) thorough workout if I do the whole 50 minutes.  I think it's great for those of us who work at a desk, as the band helps you stretch out all the muscles that have contracted while you were hunched over.  It helps me be more aware of my posture afterward too.  I also think the strength I'm gaining will help me out in my daily life, with chores, gardening and just generally feeling more fit.  Though the workout isn't intended to be aerobic, my heart rate and respiration definitely go up on the longer sets just from the intensity of the exercises.",1202428800,7,839,4.380645161290323
2868124,4,B000RIWASK,"This is a good workout when you don't have a lot of time.  This is the first time I have used a band, and I find it inconsistent.  I prefer weights, but it is a good quick workout.",1201564800,3,180,3.710526315789474
2868135,5,B000RIWASK,This was a great video with great tips. I love that you can choose a ten min. workouts if your short on time. Would recomend to others.,1199750400,2,135,4.037037037037037
2868136,5,B000RIWASK,"I bought this DVD because of the reviews, and I wasn't disappointed.  I needed something to get me started after loosing all tone and flexibilty from chemotherapy and being lathargic for almost a year.  I did buy another set of resistance bands, but only because I wanted to start gradually and work up to more resistance.  I'll definately buy more of the 10 Minute series DVDs.",1199491200,4,378,4.696969696969697
2868137,4,B000RIWASK,"Although I have been an avid Amazon shopper for nearly 10 years, this is the first time I felt inclined to write a review.  I love this DVD.  I love that you can customize your workouts (i.e. Monday: Thighs and Butt, then Upper Body), Tuesday Upper Body, Ten Minute Stretch, etc.) to fit your specific needs and time frame.  I usually add one ten minute session to the end of a cardio workout (walking, biking), and helps to rev up my metabolism even more!  Amy is so great!  She is very motivating - it seems like she is right there in the room with you encouraging you not to stop.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was that there is not a lot of explanation of the moves, and she moved quickly from one move to the next...likewise, it may be a bit challenging for some beginners.  To help with this, I would suggest watching it a few times through before trying it for yourself.",1199404800,41,890,4.230769230769231
2868138,2,B000RIWASK,"I purchased this dvd in December & after 2 uses the band has a lot of pinholes in it.  It does not stay in place very well when doing some floor exercises.  The exercises themselves are good, but she doesn't really take time to explain the moves, it may take a few times to understand the moves & be able to keep up.  I prefer using my Richard Simmons Tone & Sweat video, I feel like I've really worked out when done with that tape.",1199232000,6,432,4.0588235294117645
2868139,4,B000RIWASK,"I like this video because she does challenge you but the pace is pretty fast, sometimes it's hard to move so quickly from one thing to the next without falling over the band.  I often wonder if these quickie work out DVD's that tout 10 minute work outs are lacking in effectiveness because they don't do as many reps.  However, this is THE BEST 10 minute stretch she has at the end that I've ever come across.  I look forward to it everytime I work out... even if I go with a different DVD for my workout, I always pop this one in at the end for the stretch.",1194912000,7,558,4.10091743119266
2868140,5,B000RIWASK,"I actually really enjoyed this DVD. Because it's split into 10-minute mini workouts, you can do them all at once or one by one. I did 4 of them back to back and really felt that burn. It goes by really fast, and the stretchy band is great...quite sturdy too. Would definitely recommend.",1194307200,4,286,4.415094339622642
2868141,5,B000RIWASK,"A friend had another video in the 10 Minute Solution series, so I decided to try this one.  I absolutely love it.  The incorporation of the band means you can make it as difficult or easy as you want.  Amy uses a bunch of simple positions, changing the placement and direction you pull on the band and it just amazes me how different it will make the moves.  I get a great full-body workout and look forward to the next session using the video.  She does talk quite a bit, but her voice isn't annoying.

There are five sections to the video, targeting different areas of the body, including:
-Arms and shoulders
-Butt and thighs
-Abs

The first three sections of the video focus on the above areas of the body, respectively.  At least that's what Amy says; I feel like the sections all work everything, and the ""target area"" just a little more.  The fourth section is supposedly a total body workout, but again I feel like they all do that.  The last section is stretching.  It still makes you sweat, just not hardcore like the other sections.

I am very impressed with this buy.",1193788800,12,1079,4.448979591836735
2868142,4,B000RIWASK,"I recently bought this dvd because I am always looking for ways to tone in the shortest amount of time possible.  I do not have a weight problem but face the gravity challenge.  This workout is efficient and not too difficult.  I am an intermediate exerciser and probably always will be since I exercise for general overall health and to keep my [...] from reaching my knees.  One aspect I like about this dvd is that I can hit every muscle group in a short time.

Amy is a good instructor; not too talkative with fairly clear cues.

One of my new favorites.",1191888000,4,558,4.368932038834951
