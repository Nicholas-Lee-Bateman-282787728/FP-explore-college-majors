2202688,2,B00076YP0I,It is rated family but I though otherwise. The main character is running from the law. He has talked his son into playing illegally. He doesn't come clean until he absolutely HAS to.,1173657600,,182,4.545454545454546
2202689,4,B00076YP0I,"I was stunned that this movie captured the same sentiments I had when watching my sons play baseball. There is nothing like the culmination of a twelve-year olds season, the tournaments on the road, and under the lights.  It is a good story for young (and seasoned) athletes of any sport, of any game: The consequences of  making a decision are complex, and go way beyond the moment in time and space.  And, yeah!! the players weren't faking; they were real!",1149724800,5,458,4.62962962962963
2202690,1,B00076YP0I,"It was just awful. We got about halfway through the movie and my older boys left to go finish homework. The acting was bad, the storyline was so bad, and it just wasn't a good film. It could have been a good family film, but it completely missed the mark.

I did give it 1 star, because I like Harry Connick Jr.",1148860800,,311,4.016129032258065
2202691,3,B00076YP0I,"Mickey is an average movie coming from the mind of Grisham. I don't know if the moral is good, but the plot is descent. There's nothing smart from the plot (considering it's a John Grisham plot) Mickey is a good film with pretty good acting.",1126310400,3,241,4.377777777777778
2202692,1,B00076YP0I,"This is a bad movie.  Even my kids (who are big time little leaguers) hated it.  The basic premise of the movie is:  its okay to cheat the IRS; change your identity and that of your 13 year old son to avoid going to jail; lie about your kid's age so that he can play another year of little league (with an 80 mph fast ball no less); embarrass your City and sponsor, your teammates and their parents, and Little League, Inc.-- as long as you can throw 80 mph and beat those lieing over-agers from Cuba to 'win' the Little League World Series.  Oh, and when you do get out of jail for lieing and cheating and breaking all sorts of laws, all is foregoven, and by golly its time to get back to baseball!  There is no redeeming social or moral value to this movie.  Avoid it.  I would much rather have my kids watch Bull Durham (with a little bit of fast forwarding) than this supposed 'family baseball movie'.",1125878400,12,905,4.226744186046512
2202693,5,B00076YP0I,"Appealing to all ages. REAL family values presented in such a way as to humanize the story without too much ""syrup"".",1125619200,3,116,4.571428571428571
2202694,1,B00076YP0I,"If this very lame turkey is aimed at families with little leaguers, it is not the entertaining, stand-up-and cheer evening of entertainment Grisham intended.  The underlying premise is totally flawed, which seems to say that cheating is all right if:
a) your wife dies
b) when evading taxes and running away from stereotyped IRS agents (baddies)
c) you want to win at little league a lot so you say you're 13 when you're really 12
d) if you're playing against the also-cheating Cubans (baddies)
e) if you have a superficial girlfriend who thinks cheating is pretty OK too

The movie has a real cheesy feel to it, including very lame acting, underdeveloped subplots, contrived characters, and clichd cameos from real-life sports announcers.  The only actor I identified was the hit-man from Dumb & Dumber who dies after eating the chili peppers.  (Top notch cast.)  Harry Connick Jr. looks like he has indigestion throughout.  The kicker is the inclusion of a scene where the little leaguers are watching a ""pay"" movie in their hotel room.  You're lulled into a false sense that this is a family movie and then they include a totally inappropriate scene like that--typical Hollywood.

I've been a Grisham fan for years, but this is pure drivel.  It made me realize that his books often use this device of a man on the run from something; he should be fleeing from this dud.",1118707200,8,1372,4.804255319148936
2202695,5,B00076YP0I,"'Mickey' is a WONDERFUL family-friendly film that reinforces the concept of fairness in both sports and life. It's  chalk full of baseball action and delivers a powerful possitive message that makes keeps you on your toes through the very end last moments of the film. 'Mickey' is perfect for a pizza night at home with the kids or even a rained out sporting event.

I highly recommend this film.",1111363200,11,396,4.72463768115942

Derrick's new identity as ""Mickey"" is a year younger, which means he enters little league as a 12 year old. they thought the fraud would be over at the end of the year, but they didn't count on the team having a dream season!

2202717,2,B00076YP0I,"Cheesy, clumsy, corny. The only actor who moved me was the coach of the Moose. The main character seemed wooden. The Cubans may have come from a leftist country but, in this movie, they come from left field. Other subplots and characters seemed half-baked. Finally, the movie couldn't seem to decide if it was a family movie or an apologia for cheating. The brightest spot was the inside look it gave us of Little League Baseball, but that wasn't enough for it to reach base safely.",1328313600,,482,4.616279069767442

It's an original story by John Grisham and many of the actors are just ordinary kids. I highly recommend it.

2202720,2,B00076YP0I,"Normally, I would never think of reviewing something I didn't see to the end. But because I'd viewed the special features first, specifically John Grisham's bit, I felt compelled to.

In his interview, Mr. Grisham explains what motivated him to write 'Mickey'. (The common desire on the part of all fathers with sons graduating out of Little League to 'have one more year'.) As well, he declares as to how dissatisfying most sports movies are to him. (Because they choose actors who learn to 'fake it', rather than hiring athletes who...presumably, learn to 'fake it' where the acting is concerned.)

Oh, and I have to add this confession made during this segment:

""I'm not a screenwriter.""

Um... Yeah. I kinda figured that out, Mr. Grisham.

Look; I love a good story well-told on the silver screen. And I love me my sport films. But Mr. Grisham and I disagree entirely on what a good sports film is.

For me, a good sports film is NOT about the sport. It's about Life as set against that particular sport. If you take a look at the best, the most highly-regarded sports films of all time, those movies that are clutched to the hearts of filmlovers and sportslovers alike, you'll see what I mean. Story must come first. Then the credible transporting of this story by the actors (as guided by the director). And if all the parts are there, if they're presented to the audience in a way that moves them, that engages them, that in the end transforms them during the time they're watching it, and then resonates long after...then we have a great sports film on our hands.

I couldn't watch the entire movie. I gave up. I found myself not just rolling my eyes, but I was frustrated, I was insulted. It may well have ended up a 'wonderful family-viewing experience'. Maybe for some people...who place more value on the authenticity of the sport's reproduction than on solid storytelling combined with an appropriate level of acting...it was a great flick.

For me, it was undoubtedly a labour of love...but unfortunately, an indulgent labour of love. Nothing wrong with that, but let's at least be honest with our labels.

So in my final salvo, I'll go back to Mr. Grisham's confession, because it sums up everything:

""I'm not a screenwriter.""",1277337600,,2243,4.728205128205128
2202721,5,B00076YP0I,Mickey is a great John Grisham story put to film and is great for anyone into Little League.  Eleven - Twelve year old boys will love this film.,1250985600,,144,4.142857142857143
2202722,4,B00076YP0I,"John Grisham is a huge baseball enthusiast and even has built a Little League complex on his property and runs the league every summer so this is not a subject far from his heart. And it shows in the film. The players are really top notch players, not actors trying to look like ballplayers. They actually recruited players from coast to coast and taught them acting skills. It has the feel of real competition when you're watching the game scenes and Grisham understands the dialogue between coaches and players and it seems very realistic to someone who has also been there. The story is about Tripp Spence and son Derrick. Tripp is recently widowed and his life revolves around coaching Derrick's Little League team. Derrick is 12 and has just finished his last year of Little League (or has he?). This is the point at which many boys quit or are eliminated from baseball as they have to make the move from the reduced size fields of Little League to full size fields. Derrick would love to have the last season over and stay at the magic age of 12 forever. Unfortunately, he will get the chance. Tripp has been cheating the IRS on his taxes due to the medical bills (sounds familiar in the health care debate) surrounding his wife's death. When the IRS comes calling, rather than face the music, he decides to create a new identity for himself and Derrick and leave the state. Derrick is now 12 again. There's plenty of action and suspense to keep you engaged and the story takes several unexpected twists at the end. Very family friendly. The couple negative reviews on Amazon seem to think the film encourages cheating and deception. I would disagree and say just the opposite. Enjoy!!",1249776000,3,1691,4.65886287625418
2202723,4,B00076YP0I,"For anyone who really enjoys reading John Grisham's novels, this light hearted movie will be enjoyable. While of necessity, it lacks the depth of a Grisham novel, the authentic Grisham 'flavor' is still there, as the screen play was written by him. He also co-produced the movie.

Another plus is that this one was NOT produced by Hollywood, which means it lacks the sleazy undertone that they always add when they convert a Grisham story into a movie. It lacks the Hollywood added F bombs that typically occur every 20 seconds or so to so many Grisham based movies.

This one's a keeper, and is a fun movie for the whole fam damily! ;)",1235779200,,636,4.5701754385964914
2202724,5,B00076YP0I,"This is one of our favorite movies! We watch it 3-4 times each baseball season, so I bought one for each of my son's coaches this year as a gift.

Only negative is the scene mentioned where the coaches forget to lock the movie channels in the hotel. Nothing is shown or bad words, some moaning is heard in the background.

The basic story is one of a father-son relationship, of making mistakes and having to pay the consequences.

Highly recommended for all baseball fans!",1215820800,,473,4.541176470588235
2202725,4,B00076YP0I,"The Good:
* Great baseball action.  Much more realistic than almost every other kids baseball movie I've seen.  The actors obviously know how to really play.
* Good, clean, family movie.  Absolutely no foul language.  No sex except one regrettable piece of audio (see below).
* Decent plot and acting for a kids' movie.  Let's be honest - this isn't great cinema and isn't at the same level of dramatic effect as traditional Grisham work.  But accept it for what it is and enjoy it.

The Bad:
* One unnecessary scene where the coaches forget to cut off access to adult channels in the hotel room and the scene cuts to the kids watching porn - the TV isn't shown but you hear moans and groans in the background.  Just watch for the scene where the coaches are walking down the hotel hallway and mute the next 30 seconds.
* Everyone experiences the consequences of their cheating (they're stripped of the LLWS crown, the Cubans are sent away in disgrace, and Trip goes to jail), but the consequences fly by in about two minutes of film time.  Pay attention or you'll miss it.
* The final scene shows Mickey reunited with his dad after Trip's year in jail, but it looks like the boys have aged about 4 years during that span.  A jarring change.
* The IRS inexplicably chases down one-time tax fraud Trip but lets the career false-identity-creator go free just because he tells the feds what Trip's new name is.
* The little league coach is incompetent and portrayed as obviously overmatched and visibly overcome with nerves in every big game.  The kids, though, are as cool as the other side of the pillow.  Typical kids movie device, much as I hate it.",1182124800,3,1650,4.537162162162162
