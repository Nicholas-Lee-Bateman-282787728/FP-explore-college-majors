Also, the story is pretty decent. The characters are more than the typical one-dimensional type you usually run across in this kind of story. I've been looking for this movie for a long time. I had it on VHS something like 20 years ago and lost it, not that I have anything to play it on. Problem was I did not know the title since it was all in Chinese. I am so pleased to have found it again. If you like martial arts movies, you've gotta see this one!!",1335052800,,615,4.220338983050848

The japanese bad guy challenges the chinese masters and defeats them until he comes across wong fei hong. This battle is one of the best i've seen in awhile,and seen lots of them. This movie is a must for your collection. BUY,BUY,BUY.",987033600,,375,4.449275362318841
