6203138,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,"I was expecting this to be like those million other movies you find at the bottom of the $5 DVD barrel at Wal-mart, or the junk they show on the sci-fi channel at 2:30 in the morning, but this was very well done! I was captivated the entire time, even when my son picked out half of an almond joy from his pants and fooled me into thinking it was a piece of crap. Cute, right? Maybe if he wasn't 30! What's wrong with this kid? Where did I go wrong?",1403308800,,449,3.9450549450549453
6203139,2,B00HSJ2CVQ,"SPOILER ALERT- This movie is about time travel.  And, as interesting as that might seem, it was not entertaining  nor even thought provoking.  Total miss, with a twist at the end that was just silly.  Color me ... Unfulfilled",1402790400,4,225,4.6923076923076925
6203140,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,I liked this quirky movie! It brought to mind some fascinating scientific developments that have recently occurred. Too bad he went to visit Einstein cause Townsend Brown was the real life scientist who made startling scientific finds and little is known about his astounding research.,1402704000,3,285,5.355555555555555
6203141,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Wasn't certain about this movie at first, I worried it was going to be just another time travel flick; however, I was pleasantly surprised. The movie kept me engaged throughout and there were a couple of good twists. I definitely recommend this movie.",1402704000,2,251,4.8604651162790695
6203142,3,B00HSJ2CVQ,"This is a slow going movie ,it  could have had so much  more potential . It was repetitive and boring . Another movie I couldn't wait to finish .The cast though I will say had some good acting and the dialog scenes were well done . For a second I could see the father and son on broadway . Quickly giving way to a boring script .",1402617600,,329,3.8955223880597014
6203143,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,"I hesitated to watch this movie, having seen so many sci fi versions of time travel movies. I'm very glad I chose to watch this.

Not only does the science behind the movie's premise come across as plausible (unlike most movies in this slice of sci fi), the characters and drama outside of the core concept is well done. You could remove the time travel concept from this movie, and a lot of the philosophical questions that the characters struggle with still stand.

I credit the screenplay, the direction, and several of the main characters for keeping this movie equal parts on the human condition, and on a hard sci fi premise for dealing with those ""what if?"" questions that everyone faces.",1402617600,2,695,4.688524590163935
6203144,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Not only was this movie intriguing and, IMHO, very good; but, it caught me off guard with some issues that made this movie somewhat of an emotional ride (that I was not expecting).",1402617600,2,180,4.484848484848484
6203145,5,B00HSJ2CVQ,A great science fiction story intertwined with those meaningful family emotions that make you really feel something wonderful. I highly recommend it for the average science-fiction buff.,1402444800,27,186,5.925925925925926
6203146,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,This is not a fast paced movie. It is more quiet than your typical science-fiction. It is a movie about three generations of scientists in a family who love each other deeply. Some of them are also passionate about their research. The movie gets the science right & the emotional aspects in the relationships also seem genuine. There are a lot of themes from the film that I think I'll be discussing with my husband long after the movie finished. I will see it again. Well worth the price.,1402272000,83,489,4.50561797752809
6203147,3,B00HSJ2CVQ,It was good.,1489017600,,12,3.3333333333333335
6203148,5,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Excellent movie. I did not see the ending coming. If you like an unusual time travel story, this one I highly recommend.",1488672000,,120,4.5
6203149,2,B00HSJ2CVQ,"I don't think Time Travel fans will enjoy this movie too much because the time travel aspect has little to with the story other than provide hope that the sad parts can be undone and have a happy ending.  The story focuses on the drama caused by a time traveler who travelled to the past and was unable to return, leaving his wife and kids feeling abondoned and thinking him dead.  When time travel is brought in, its almost not even a big deal, the bigger focus on the relationship between the Son and his girlfriend who he is now spending less time with.  This should be classied as a Drama 1st, then mystery/missing person,  and lastly Sci Fi.  There is no comedy or action here, no time travel paradoxes, no fancy time machine or special effects.
I can understand if people like the movie, but those wanting an interesting Time Travel plot should look elsewhere.",1488412800,,866,4.5256410256410255
6203150,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,This was a lot better than I expected it to be. I'd definitely recommend it.,1486944000,,76,4.133333333333334
6203151,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,Real good movie a like the end,1486425600,,30,3.4285714285714284
6203152,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,The movie was solidly a good movie.  I didn't like the ending and thought the writers of the story could have done a better job of ending it but it was interesting.  If you build a time machine don' t go back in time and tell Albert Einstein.  It might not be that healthy for you.,1486252800,,281,3.982142857142857
6203153,5,B00HSJ2CVQ,Well played and written. it ties tragedy and science together. a scientist must decide between family and science.,1486166400,,114,5.388888888888889
6203154,5,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Wow. This is science fiction with a heart. Excellent acting. Deeply meaningful. I recommend watching it.

6203155,5,B00HSJ2CVQ,"I'm surprised. I was thinking this wasn't going to be good. I wasn't sure of the actors and while I was watching the characters didn't seem to have too much depth (Let's admit, most shows and movies we watch and love don't either). The story is slow, but that was okay with me. The end kinda left a hard knot in my throat. I liked it.",1485993600,,334,4.075757575757576

6203162,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,This was pretty interesting with some surprising twists. Good performances by everyone involved. I was pretty impressed. Joel Haley Osment still has acting chops. Good production values.,1485820800,,186,5.925925925925926

6203165,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Really liked this movie. The acting was really pretty good and the concept was nicely presented. It didn't really get in the way, performers stumbling all over each other and such, while the plot wasn't all gooey with one scene trying to be more important than the next. Just liked it very much. Gillian Anderson, sigh, still a personal favorite. Haley Joel didn't do a bad job at all. I would watch it again.",1485475200,,409,4.54054054054054

6203168,3,B00HSJ2CVQ,Potential to be a great film but poor ending. Good acting.,1485388800,,58,4.363636363636363

6203172,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,Entertaining but a bit slow...,1485129600,,30,5.2
6203173,5,B00HSJ2CVQ,A small quiet sci-fi movie. with interesting twists. A son searches for his father down a wormhole and an unusual path to bring him home.,1485129600,,137,4.52
6203174,5,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Very interesting, great story plot, good acting and surprise ending,,,YES",1485129600,,73,6.4
6203175,5,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Ok, wow, that was great! I expected the acting to be great with Gillian Anderson and Rufus Sewell, but Haley Joel Osment was remarkably endearing and powerful in his role.
The story was also great... a bit slow at times, but necessarily so. It was well written and had enough depth to pull me in more and more.
The unexpected ending was the clincher for me. This is the type of film that I will watch again and again.
You won't be disappointed... unless you have grown accustomed to explosions, robots and epic space battles as the norm.
This is a thoughtful and well-crafted story. Slow down and watch it.",1484870400,,606,4.5181818181818185
6203176,3,B00HSJ2CVQ,"I was looking for some mild entertainment while doing some mindless paperwork, and this fit the bill perfectly.  If you are looking for a hardcore science fiction film, you will probably be disappointed.  The story is not about the sci or the fi, but about the loss of a loved one and what you might do and how much you might risk to get them back.  It's not the only movie to consider the topic, but I thought it did a better job than most when it comes to portraying the trade-offs one might have to deal with in making that choice.  I found the ending unexpected and clever.",1484784000,,577,4.26605504587156

6203181,3,B00HSJ2CVQ,"This movie is more about family drama than science fiction. Good, well known actors. Slow paced.",1484179200,,96,5.0625
6203182,5,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Excellent film.  The cover looks very low-budget.  Perhaps it was made on a low budget, but it's well worth the watch.  Haley Joel Osment, Rufus Sewell, Gillian Anderson all work together flawlessly.  The story is science fiction at its best: no crazy special effects,but rather a story all about the characters.  Highly recommended.",1484092800,,333,5.2075471698113205
6203183,3,B00HSJ2CVQ,Overall the movie was decent.  I just hated the ending.  Just left you hanging.,1484092800,,79,4.571428571428571

6203193,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Time travel is the end game, but for the purpose of love is it actually important. Really good drama with the back-drop of time-travel and physics.",1482624000,,147,4.6923076923076925
6203194,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Good movie; however, the title does not represent the content well.",1482537600,,67,5.181818181818182

6203197,5,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Good cast, great acting, directing.  As time travel movies go, really well thought out.  Post modern in all aspects but just plain fun.
LOL The only way the movie could have been better (or worse?!) is if David Duchovny had played in it, but seeing Rufus Sewell long since Dark City was nice (and this a far better piece).",1482278400,,322,4.440677966101695

6203199,5,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Intriguing and suspenseful! Surprises and lots of drama throughout right up to the end. If you like Frequency,  and Sixth Sense,  you will like this. It is not too sciencey, but just enough for the average, well-informed citizen.",1482105600,,229,5.0

6203210,3,B00HSJ2CVQ,Interesting concept and did keep my interest. Acting was good and the storyline was well thought out. Wasn't exactly an Academy award winner and was a little slow at times. Overall it was intriguing and the ending was a surprise and not what I expected. Gillian Anderson is a much better actress than the gloomy character she played in this one. I would recommend this movie for something to watch but not really a date night movie and definitely not much action.,1481587200,,463,4.658536585365853
6203211,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,"There's no huge twisted plots or mind-bending story lines - unless you really don't get what happened from the start i guess.
it was nicely done. Gillian is great!",1481587200,,163,4.655172413793103
6203212,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,Intriguing...a little slow in some places but ending was shocking and thought provoking I will watch it again because i'm sure I missed something the first time around.,1481414400,,168,5.035714285714286

6203215,5,B00HSJ2CVQ,A small but thoughtful movie. It was more interested in story than special effects. It wasn't written for fourteen year old boys. It takes and adult look at the conundrum that is a potential of time travel.,1481328000,,206,4.594594594594595

6203228,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,"I liked it. It is a bit slower paced and the main protagonist does make a few choices that seemed illogical to me (I'd explain, but ""spoilers""). Otherwise, it's a well acted, well told story.",1478995200,,191,4.485714285714286

6203235,3,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Overall, just ok.  I was never really captured by the characters in this fairly routine time travel yarn, so wasn't that concerned about how their story might end.  I will admit that I didn't see coming the 'shocking' event at the end, but then again, it didn't have the power it might for some because of my general disinterest by that time.",1478217600,,342,4.5
6203236,5,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Finally, a movie portraying intelligent people without making them snarky or so annoyingly fake. (i.e Jurassic Park series)

In an age of big budget special effects and lots of  whiz bang, ""I'll Follow You Down"", substitutes a decent script, a solid though well-worn plot, and a great cast.  The result is nice little gem of a sci fi movie.  It was also a pleasure seeing Haley Osment who I haven't seen in a movie in quite a while (A.I., The Sixth Sense, etc.).  I highly recommend it.",1477872000,,385,4.291666666666667

6203246,2,B00HSJ2CVQ,"While ""I'll Follow You Down"" is not an awful movie and only nominally about time travel, it left me wishing I could get back about two-thirds of the time I spent watching it.  Fans of big CGI action films won't find much to appreciate here, nor will those who appreciate intelligent discourse.  This is a quiet, indie film that uses time travel to look at the lives of the people left behind when their husband/father disappears on a business trip.  Given the movie's sci-fi premise, with a little more attention to character and intellectual consistency and much less reliance on a slightly surprising twist at the end (which should have been entirely unnecessary, if the father had half a brain), this could have been a much better movie.",1477267200,,740,4.765625
6203247,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,"The story is good, and interesting. I think the producer has got most out of such a cheap movie. But as a science student, I think the ending is not quite self-explanatory. The theory here is ""parallel universe"", so no matter what Eric do, he can only change the life path of himself in the other universe together with his coming back live father and happy family, not the tragic one of that has been set up particular him. Therefore, instead of committing a suicide (sorry to be a spoiler) at the end which changes nothing than adding sadness to his already broken GF at (the time-traveling version) his universe, he should just travel back to the universe belongs to him, and wish the good luck of the other version of him live a happy and good life ever since. This kind of ending might not be as surprising as the movie has, but indeed a more logic and scientific one. But every coin has two side, my suggested type of ending may just bring down the rating of the movie, who knows, LOL. In a word, a good time travel film, may be better in some sense.",1477267200,,1056,4.338383838383838

For Sci-Fi aficionados the ""science"" will drive you nuts.  They start talking about alternate universes and then say ""We'll reset and correct everything and it'll all change to be different, we'll never know the difference!""  Yeah guys that's not how it works...  That's the 'Back to the Future' logic where alternate timelines don't exist.  It's fun to speculate either way, but please don't bring up alternate timelines and then act like those alternate timelines won't exist anymore.

How two 'scientists' can never have the conversation that it's possible all timelines will continue existing is mind boggling.

This movie is slower-moving than the usual science fiction movie. It represents a different kind of science fiction movie, one that is responsible, one that considers the ramifications of new knowledge. In this way, it is excellent. It is also about sacrifices that one makes in order to put things right.

The acting in this movie is excellent. Gillian Anderson is very convincing as the distraught widow. Haley Joel Osment is convincing as a young man torn between choices. This is a science fiction movie with a compassion and sensitivity.",1469664000,,798,4.733812949640288

It's a time travel story written by someone who knows time travel stories and he's actively playing a certain trope against the audience. Interesting and weird and it develops in a strange way where people take a completely untested and fictional sounding phenomenon dead seriously... and this is common for most sci fi movies but because most of this movie is very much simply a family drama, it comes across as very very weird.

Rotten Tomatoes gives it 33% on 9 reviews.  I was sure it was a stinker.

The problem, however, is that this is smart science fiction.  This is what science fiction is supposed to be!  The low rating is not because there is anything wrong with the film; the problem is that the reviewers are not intelligent enough to appreciate it.

They had these polls to find the best Star Trek episodes.  From the original series the winner was The Trouble with Tribbles.  For the Next Generation it was the one where Picard's mind was hijacked by a machine that caused him to live the life of an alien whose civilization was destroyed; he fell in love, married, had children, grew old.  There are all these Star Trek episodes where there are titanic battles with ray guns firing all over the place, blowing up space stations and spaceships, but the episodes that fans judged to be the best were the ones that were human in scale.  One was a silly comedy and the other was a sincere depiction of life and love.

That is what this movie is.  It is a depiction of what the human side of time travel would be.  It is about the love of family members for each other.

This is an unusually smart science fiction film.  It might help you to become a better person.",1468972800,,1284,4.377118644067797

Some glaring plot holes but they are mostly forgettable. The acting by the Sixth Sense kid and the X-Files lady are pretty good.

The movie does a nice job of leading you along, making you think you know what's going to happen  by telegraphing it from a mile away (I guess saying 'telegraphing's days are numbered.) What feels like alot of foreshadowing turns out to actually be clever twists and turns, but not to the point that it becomes silly. And is it just me, or did anybody else see dead people? In truth, could have been another generic genre movie, but by avoiding common pitfalls and focusing on the characters, a surprisingly excellent movie.",1463616000,,656,4.7043478260869565

The plot revolves around the balance between family and work goals including the lofty aspiration of proving time travel to be possible.

I found the relationship focus to be much more entertaining than the science fiction aspect.

6203771,5,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Competent, classic time paradox story. If you like time travel stories, you'll dig this one. Follows much of the obvious trope laid by earlier films of the genre, with a subtleness that isn't obvious until the ending.

One of the better performances I've seen Gillian Anderson put in to date, one that having seen all of the Xfiles - I wasn't quite sure she could pull off. Her role is grounded even when the story and the players around her are anything but.

Haley Joel Osment, as an adult child star working to revitalize his career seems almost too fitting for the role. At the credits I had to check to see that he didn't write the film, as the story seemed a it bit allegorical, as if Hugo was a fictional substitution for the real life director M. Night Shyamalan.

Rufus Sewell was great. I'm not sure many other actors would have been able to pull off that role. He was subtle and nuianced, somehow allowing his character to develop a great deal of depth with limited screen time.",1457568000,,989,4.483333333333333

6203795,3,B00HSJ2CVQ,"In theory, science fiction permits the exploration of ideas that would be difficult otherwise to elaborate when confined to a more traditional narrative. In the literature of science fiction this freedom has resulted in some truly imaginative and important works such as Fahrenheit 451, parts of Asimov's Foundation series, and Shute's On the Beach. Interesting sci-fi movies are much more rare, and among the few examples is of course 2001 A Space Odyssey as well as the lesser-known Coherence.

Most sci-fi, however, is merely tedious reworking of existing genres with a thin layer of magic-tech over the surface. Examples include the genre of cowboys-in-space (Star Wars, Star Trek, The Martian) and soap-opera-in-space (also Star Wars). Worst of all are sci-fi movies that have pretentions to actual  science but the script writers/editors are so scientifically illiterate that they get the basics totally wrong. Gravity and Interstellar are merely two recent examples of this sort of infantile nonsense.

Sadly, I'll Follow You Down belongs firmly in the latter camp. The basic setup has potential: a man invents a time machine (that is, apparently, wonderfully economical with its use of power, but we'll let that slide...) and goes back to 1946 where he is unexpectedly mugged and killed. Thus he never returns to his original time and from that failure to return follows the rest of the story.

The man's son, being also a mathematical genius, eventually determines (with the help of his also-a-maths-whiz professorial grandfather) that their present timeline is ""wrong"" and can be modified if he, the son, intercepts his father in the past to make everything right again (""how it should have been""). Now in principle this is a really interesting setup. The protagonists have lived out 12 years on this ""wrong"" timeline. If the timeline is ""corrected"" they will cease to exist and alternates of themselves will live out a different timeline. But the current protagonists will cease to exist. There is thus an existential question: should the protagonists cancel out their own existence in favor of analogs who will then live the ""correct"" timeline? Is it ethical to eradicate everyone you know in order to restore a hypothetical ""correct"" timeline? This is a question of identity. What does it mean to say ""another me"" will take my place if I suddenly cease to exist? What might I owe that ""other"" me and all the ""other"" protagonists whose lives were affected by the time-travel event?

Furthermore, what if the entire question is irrelevant? In other words, the protagonists in the current timeline are basically trapped there and it will play out according to the logic of the father never returning whereas the alternate timeline will play out (where the father does return) because the two timelines fork at the zero point and this fork is now fundamental to the twin timelines existing in parallel but never touching.

These are really interesting questions and could have led to a fascinating script.

But these questions are never asked (indeed I doubt the script writers even understood they are implicit in the setup) and therefore never explored. Instead we just have a tedious slow-paced soap opera that reflects on nothing, explores nothing, and leads to nothing. I'm not really sure whether or not this is because movie makers assume no one out there is interested in thought-provoking movies, or because movie makers tend to be intellectually limited and therefore trapped in the tiny rooms of their own cramped imaginations.

Whichever the case, this is just another dull movie that asks nothing of its audience and gives nothing in return. The allusion to ""negative energy"" resulting from the movement of two frames of reference (a hilariously inept view of the Lorenz transformations that are central to Einstein's first paper on relativity) is apt only in the sense that this movie sucks the energy out of what could have been an interesting concept and leaves us with an overall negative: the time spent watching it was wasted and could better have been used doing something else instead.",1457222400,2,4115,5.104011887072808

It you're going to go back in time to see Einstein (which is central to the movie) at least come up with a good reason for doing it.
I suppose it's a  low budget film so expectations shouldn't be too high. If you really want to get your mind bent by time travel paradoxes, watch the Spierigs' Predestination movie.",1454544000,,483,4.366666666666666

6204059,5,B00HSJ2CVQ,"I absolutely loved The Time Machine (book & movie) as a kid. My father was a sci-fi nut & took us kids to every movie (sci-fi or not) that came along during the 1950s/60s. Dad had a telescope that we used frequently, also a microscope. He was a geologist who helped mapped Antarctica. But he also suffered horrible PTSD (we called them ""rage fits""). I often wondered what might have happened had he not served in WWII where he saw his BF's head blown off by a kamakazi pilot/gunner.
So this film hit me in so many ways. I grew up around scientists/explorers--people like my father who risked their lives (in war & also mapping Antarctica in the early 1960s, living in igloos--Dad has a glacier & a mountain peak in Antarctica named after him (Elder glacier/peak) due to the fact that he nearly died on an icy promontory during a blizzard while there.
Altho' I went another route, teaching English Lit', doing art & writing poetry (many published in literary journals), I have kept my love for science and also hoped that someone would figure out how to travel in time.
There is very little violence in this film. Thank Heavens--no car chases, no shoot-outs. But it is deeply compelling & exciting. I felt utter thrills in watching the particle scientists work on their theory, trying to make it into reality. So many science fiction ideas have come true, so anything is possible.
Without giving spoilers, I will say that Gillian Anderson ripped out my soul with her performance. I've always loved Rufus Sewell and he is wonderful in this film, too.
John Paul Ruttan is perfect as the young Erol. Victor Garber is compelling as the obsessed grandfather (of Erol). Haley Joel Osmet is fantastic as the adult Erol. Susanna Fournier is touching as Grace. In fact, all the actors are brilliant.
The music by Andrew Lockington is perfect throughout.
The cinematography by Tico Poulakakis is utterly elegant. Richie Mehta, director, is a genius.
Watch this film! You will love it.",1453593600,,1973,4.755102040816326

I thought it would be more on the sci-fi side but was pleasantly surprised to find it dealing with the difficult decisions of time travel and in-depth realistic considerations of possible consequences. The intense thought provoking concepts and explorations of their intended actions is what made me really enjoy the movie enough to give it a full five stars.

6204108,5,B00HSJ2CVQ,"This is a very cool time travel story told from the a heart-felt, perspective of the family who were victims of the patriarch's selfish desires to perfect Einstein's theories on the subject.  I am a huge sci-fi fan and have grown accustomed to fantastical landscapes created through warping space-time and anxiously awaiting the results from some group or individual making waves in time lines in alternate universes.  However, this story was pleasantly emotional and I enjoyed seeing the emotional states of the family left behind, take their painfully tragic turns.  Normally you see them driving the story and typically see the time traveler(s) imposing their wills and satisfying their desires (misguided or not).  Much of those types of stories are guided by them.
This story is VERY different.  It is really refreshing to see, in this case, the emotional toll taken on the family left behind and how that pain is used as the driver to set things right by the son.  The story was kind of slow, but there is as much a character study in play when the the leads have taken such emotional dives as a result of what happened, that I guess it's to be expected.  The story isn't as woefully linear as it easily could have been, so I'm glad time was apropriately taken to explore the emotional states of the mother, son and the grandfather.  The son's reluctance at times, is mainly what keeps this from being predictably linear, so kudos to the writers and the director.
The emotional high-point for me, came at the end.  WOW! What a shocker.  The son knew how reluctant his father would be in traveling back to the present with haste, in order to resolve the horrible ends of those left behind in the present.  Knew his father so well, in fact, that what he set up to ensure his father complied was well...shocked the daylights out of me, for sure.  FANTASTIC ENDING!!!
I give this movie 5 stars because it hit all the marks of a wonderfully told piece of science fiction and the the perspective from which it was told and how carefully and beautifully it lays out the cost of what happens when selfish choices are made for the sake of personal, scientific discovery at the expense of those we love - without having carefully thought out the consequences. AND it did it without having to use the special effects sequences we've come to expect with sci-fi stories dealing with time travel.
Really kewl movie!!!",1452470400,,2409,4.70952380952381
6204109,2,B00HSJ2CVQ,"His grandfather's entire premise is based on the idea of alternate realities.  In other words, an infinite number of universes which are continuously created at every juncture created by a decision point.  According to him, they have been placed in their own unique timeline from the point which his father left.  Erol repeatedly assures his girlfriend that their life will be somehow better after he goes back and alters his father's path.  The issue with that is, he is not altering their reality.  Only the one that he somehow left years ago when his father died.  From her perspective, he will have left and disappeared in the same manner that his father did so many years before.",1452384000,,684,4.803418803418803
6204110,3,B00HSJ2CVQ,"So, in theory, this story is about time travel and the ramifications of one person changing history through the eyes of the people he left behind.

In actuality this is a story about how Haley Joel Osment's character is surrounded by the most selfish people in existence.

Spoilers ahead.

HJO's dad abandons his wife and child to travel back in time to meet his childhood hero, without anything set in place in case the TOTALLY UNTESTED and UNBELIEVABLY DANGEROUS experiment he's been constructing in TOTAL SECRECY goes wrong.  In a shocking turn of events, he doesn't come back from the past. Who could have seen this coming.

This makes HJO terrified of people leaving him so he devotes 100% of his time and energy to making the people around him happy, mostly his mother and his girlfriend. It is stated by multiple characters in text that he is almost absurdly invested in making them happy so they'll stick around. Then, the second he doesn't indulge his mother in reminiscing about his dead and/or deadbeat dad, she kills herself. Just straight up kills herself in the house they both live in with the last memory HJO has of her being their fight and he is the one to find her body. Mother of the year.

Then, when he becomes more invested in time travel to try and bring his father back and less invested in his girlfriend, she starts out by basically pouting and throwing temper tantrums. Later on it's better explained that she's always nervous, always on the edge, because any second could be her last in this life when HJO changes the past. But before that's explained, and even after, she comes off as being incredibly selfish that HJO isn't constantly waiting on her hand and foot like he used to.

The only character who isn't a selfish douchebag, besides HJO himself, is his grandfather who just wants to bring back Deadbeat Dad to make his daughter happy again. He doesn't push anytime HJO says no and does what he can on his own.

The story itself doesn't really have a structure. Instead of 3 act it's more like A-Z acts with no theme connecting them. The ending was...dreary. Like it is meant to end on a happy note but the character we've spent the entire movie with is basically punished? For having s***ty people around him?? And no one really learned anything, except maybe Deadbeat Dad but only when the knowledge was FORCED on him after he refused it over and over because, well, Deadbeat Dad is Deadbeat.

The idea was good, I really liked HJO's character, but I spent most of the film indignant on his behalf and that's not really an emotion I look for when watching a movie.",1452384000,,2603,4.60475161987041
6204111,5,B00HSJ2CVQ,"I really liked this movie. I was excited about the brainy side of the movie, but I also agreed with the female (I can't remember her name, erel's girlfriend).

Still, when, as a man, he is offered an opportunity to correct this disaster, the son is reluctant to do so because it will be at the cost of tthe life which he has created for himself in the aftermath of his father's death. I can't give this movie five stars because I felt that its ending, although both dramatic and credible, found too  easy a solution to the really terrible dillemma it initially established, but later retreated from.

The actor who plays his father is tall and handsome with a long, narrow face while HJO is very short and has an almost completely round, small head with tiny facial features.  Gillian Anderson, who plays his mother, also has prominent facial features.  It's just bizarre to think they could have produced HJO.

6204133,2,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Have you ever been talking to someone on the phone and have them tell you that they're about to run out of minutes but to ""keep talking""? You know how you stand there after the line goes dead with an unfinished conversation in your head and been frustrated because what you had to say was important? And, because they're out of minutes, you can't call them back.

That's what the ending of this movie was like. It was like the director ran out of minutes during the most important moment in the conversation.

I love stories in all forms--books, movies, plays, ballads, radio shows, etc.  As a fan of a good story, I don't care whether the science behind time travel is sound.  I care about the story and I really care about the ending. Let's face it, the ending makes the suffering we go through with the characters worth the journey. It doesn't have to be happy, but the wrap up is important. When there's no wrap up, when the key question is unanswered, I feel cheated. Good endings can go a long way toward saving a bad movie. But a bad ending can ruin an otherwise good movie.

The acting was good (am a fan of Gillian Anderson), the script was fine, the and the story was dark, but intriguing. I was invested. I wanted to know if the gamble paid off. If everyone was happier for the decisions made. Instead I got an unfinished conversation.

It started slow, but I think it needed to, to set up the environment of how impacted their lives were from one choice that the father made and what was at stake for Erol (Haley's character) to convince his father to make different choices.

6204180,1,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Victor Garber and Gillian Anderson are wonderful actors, and the rest of the cast is perfectly solid. Some other reviewers seem to be confusing the quality of the acting with the quality of the writing and direction. They shouldn't. But they are quite correct that the story is just wretched on multiple levels.

Right off the bat, science fiction too often is treated like a kind of film ghetto where genuine plausibility and realism is utterly optional. I'm talking about fundamental things, not the SF elements themselves. In ""Interstellar,"" to cite an example, they postulate that NASA was quietly given funding in the midst of civilization's collapse to pay for a last-ditch effort to find a new home for humanity ... but, somehow, the agency utterly neglected to recruit and train a new batch of top-notch astronauts in the process. Nope, they had to go to bizarre lengths -- involving drones and weirdball clues -- to lure a retread out of retirement over to their secret nest. Nevermind the science, this is not plausible in any respect. It wouldn't be plausible in ANY story, sci fi or not. So, too, here. Honestly: do you think that there are crates locked up ANYWHERE, marked ""Property of Albert Einstein"", that have been left to gather dust in nearly-forgotten basement storerooms? Really? That's absurd. Yeah, I'll cheerfully suspend my disbelief IF the filmmaker is willing to earn it. But they don't earn it, they scarcely even try.

Okay, let's jump past the heaps of plausibility speed bumps in this film. But then we get to where the rubber meets the road in any film that tries to claim a science fiction mantle: the SCIENCE. Now how do I put this? Oh, yeah: in this film, there is NO science. None. Nada, Zippo. Mumbo-jumbo and big sciency-sounding words must carry all the weight.

Right off the bat, this is almost inevitable because this is a time-travel film. Some people love those. I will give one a pass if it has enough other elements to make the ride a lot of fun (""Back to the Future"" anyone?). But rarely are time-travel tales worth anything, because they run smack into horrific contradictions. In this one, the scientist's son travels back to save his dad from an untimely death in the past. Well, okay ... and if he succeeds, then he was never in a position (or had a need) to do this, so he wouldn't, so no one would come back to save dad, so dad would die, so the son would then have reason to come back to save him, so dad would live, so the son would not be in a position ....

See what I mean? That's why so many good SF writers really try to avoid time travel yarns as a matter of policy. Too many problems start at the conceptual level. Here's another one: the idea that a couple of math whizzes could whack out a working time machine in the basement with some sheet metal, a few blocks of styrofoam, and lots of spit and string. I could enjoyably accept that notion when the film was, say, ""Time After Time,"" and it was all about H.G. Wells having a REAL time machine with which to chase Jack the Ripper. (Hell, his machine looked so much cooler, too. This one looks like a recycled contestant's booth from ""The $54,000 Question."") Well, Time After Time wasn't making the least pretense at being science fiction. It was fantasy from the get-go. This film, by contrast, offers nothing fun and catchy, so there really has to be some plausible science. And there just isn't.

Another example: turns out they need to account for the earth's motion in the decades since 1946 (a minor plot device, also, in Time After Time). But the calculations just don't work ... until -- well snap my suspenders -- they forgot to account for earth quakes which moved the earth's crust slightly. Really? Like real scientists wouldn't have considered tectonic issues thoroughly if tracking the earth's precise movements through 50 odd years was vital? Moreover, the film makes clear they haven't included our solar system's own slow rotation within the Milky Way galaxy ... or the galaxy's motions relative to the rest of the universe. They thought they were being clever just mentioning adjustments for leap years.

Bottom line: don't waste your time on this one. Several of the cast are really quite terrific, but their performances just can't do the heavy lifting necessary in a muddled and dubious script to make this dog worth watching.",1448755200,3,4362,4.680573663624511

6204296,3,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Not outstanding, but not a total stinker, either.  A son, very young when his father disappeared on a business trip, grows up, and with the help of his grandfather, unravels the clues that leads the son to attempt a time travel experiment in order to prevent his mother's suicide,and bring his father back.  The not so great part, is that the mother is totally co-dependent, leading to her demise.  This gives a poor message to young women.  On the bright side, this movie could be used to bring up the issue of co-dependence with a young woman and set her straight.  The son's girlfriend also lives in fear of losing him should he be successful at returning his father to the present.  Keeping in mind that movies/television shows are designed to formulate the mind set/belief system of viewers, (in this case that women are nothing without a man, and that women/women's needs are secondary to those of a male, or are not important), you might find this movie somewhat amusing.",1446249600,,978,4.723529411764706

But, again, the ending was too abrupt, too weak, and made it a waste of time...no pun intended.

Victor Garber was the only bright spot in the film, always is a solid performer giving energy & life to his characters. Sorry, I dearly love Gillian Anderson, she was as good as she could be in this film...but she was truly wasted in this role.",1445558400,4,574,4.336448598130841

Haley Jo Osment always draws you in like he did when he uttered ""I see dead people"". He's all grown up now and still as evocative as he was as a child actor.

He managed to figure out his dad's formula for going back into one's past with his version of the time machine.

The limitations were certainly not in the actors but the storyline. I knew the ending unlike M Knight Shamalan's movies",1445558400,,555,4.177570093457944

I'm kind of addicted to anything that has to do with time travel, so I've seen them all, I think. Of course I didn't understand all the math stuff, but that doesn't matter. What matters is that the movie makes you think and after you've seen it, you're still thinking about it, even a few days later.  The idea that IF the son goes back in time and prevents his father from one fate, then he will live the life that he is intended to live, instead of living out the life he has been living, is an intriguing concept. Haven't we all thought about something that we've done or something that has happened to us and had the thought ""If I had just left the house a minute later than I did, that wouldn't have happened, and my whole life would be different,"" or ""If I hadn't gone to that party, then I wouldn't have met so-and-so, and my life would be totally different,"" etc.  That's sort of what the theme of this movie is, except it's dependent on time travel and one man's choice, followed by his son's choice later on. I think it's definitely worth seeing.",1445558400,4,1159,4.3119266055045875

This is a good one that doesn't throw equations and specifics at you to try to figure out while you're trying to figure out what is happening in the movie. Another thing to mention is I don't think the word ""paradox"" is mentioned once in this, which is always a good thing because once that word is used, you know there's going to be confusion. Great work by everyone involved in this. It's a nice surprise that you might not have heard of(I hadn't, I first heard about it on here).

I guess they're not mainstream enough to make the money people want to make. That being said, this movie does a really fine job of dealing with the paradox of time travel. The drama and suspense are ture to life and there aren't any stupid plot flaws. No overt sex (which is a sign of realy bad sci-fi).",1443916800,,455,4.428571428571429

6204546,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,"This is really a surprising movie with beautiful acting and an unexpected ending.  Haley Joe Osment is excellent in it, as is Gillian Anderson, and Victor Garber.  It is really nice to see someone such as Haley Joe continuing to act as an adult.  So many child stars seem to quit acting when they become adults and aren't so ""adorable"" anymore.  However, he was always a fine actor and has just gotten better with time.  It takes awhile for the story to unfold and it seems slow, at first, but with patience it builds into quite an amazing story of time travel, accidents, and the effects that trying to change time has on the lives of everyone involved.  I gave it four stars because so much of the video is dark (as in not enough light on the set) so it can be hard to see at times.  Otherwise, a very interesting movie.",1443571200,,822,4.333333333333333

I always look for films with Rufus Sewell. He was great in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-City/dp/B0010T7R5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark City</a>, but since then he seems to be stuck playing a sneering villain (you might remember him in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Knight-s-Tale/dp/B000RL1G32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Knight's Tale</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Illusionist-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000K7VHQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Illusionist (Widescreen Edition)</a>. He's appealing as a positive character here, but with a dark side, and perhaps some hidden motivations.

Haley Joel Osment is very good in this as well. He hasn't shaken free from his Sixth Sense persona really, and this was a good choice for him. Also good is the X-Files' Gillian Anderson.

What I liked most was that this was an actor driven story, not special effects driven. You get so used to seeing explosions every two seconds, that it's nice to see a film that develops dramatic tension in other ways. There is a bit of a time travel element here, but the actual treatment of time travel is more in a theoretical sense (which is refreshing). There is a diner scene at the end that's reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Predestination/dp/B00QGL1P5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Predestination</a>, but don't be put off, this is a much more approachable sci-fi flick (I liked Predestination...but it's intense).

6204714,3,B00HSJ2CVQ,"The story was rather better than the casting, and the whole thing was too slow and 'atmospheric'. Gillian Anderson was the best part of the movie but the story could have been told in a 45 minute episode rather than padded into movie length.",1441843200,,241,4.5

6204734,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,"This was a good movie. I really enjoy watching Haley Joel as he matures into a fine actor, and of course the other stars were great as always too. It was a little strange seeing Gillian Anderson play a role that is so different from her X-Files days and it was a treat to see her perform the role. The story is my type of tale, even though I know they sacrifice real science for movie science, I don't mind when the story is so good you don't care to notice. This movie will tickle the wonderlust if you have some and the scenes and props are gorgeous physically and the way they are filmed. This to me, an untrained and simple movie watcher, is great fare and worth your time.",1441670400,,677,4.175572519083969

6204741,2,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Shallow and predictable plot. Obviously too far from any real science. Adult actors don't seem to age. They don't even change their haircut in what is supposed to be a 12-year span.

6204745,5,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Interesting premise, meticulously crafted build up to a startling climax, and a crisp ending. The only place the film misses - and not enough to lose a star over it - is the production value around the Princeton of the Past sequences. The interior of the storeroom looks like a set from a high school play, and the otherwise serviceable exteriors are peopled with extras so wooden that, for a moment, I thought I'd bumbled into a zombie film.",1441670400,,442,4.6075949367088604

6204790,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,"First of all, saying this is ""starring"" Gillian Anderson is a misnomer.  Certainly she is in it but hardly in a starring role.  This actually stars Haley Joel Osment and Victor Garber.

Osment, as the adult Erol is son of missing father, Gabriel (Rufus Sewell).  Erol is a math genius as was his father and grandfather Sal (Garber).  Sal posits to Erol his father was working on a time machine.  Eventually Erol comes to grips with this and decides to go back and find his missing father.

This is an ingenious plot and the acting is fairly solid.  It entertains and didn't leave the viewer scratching their head at the end of it.",1441497600,,630,4.513274336283186

Rufus Sewell is underused in my opinion, and I took one star off for not believing the relationship between father and grown up son, because Sewell and Osment did not, because of a rushed ending, have time to gel together.

It is a cut well above a B movie and a worthy use of your time.  Several twists will surprise you, though the reason for the time travel itself is more of an excuse.

Just 10 minutes in, it turned into some absurd speculation about alternate realities and time travel. As someone who generally doesn't like fantasy or time travel crap, I was highly disappointed. I turned it off after 3o minutes.

If you're into that genre, go for it. If not, you might want to skip it.",1439078400,,385,4.579710144927536

Lots of switching back and forth with the characters as to when they were children and adults.  I guess this is normal with time travel movies.

It's  not a great one, but it does have a surprise that I wasn't expecting, and that's always a plus! On a side note, it's really irritating that we pay for Prime partly for the Prime video movies & TV, but then Amazon charges us rent  even movies that have been out for many many years. Charge everyone else, but give Prime members a break!! If it's been out over 5 yrs it ought to be free to Prime members. When you're looking for a good movie, and you start to scroll through the lists, it's almost as bad as our local cable. I watched this movie on Amazon Fire TV and I would like more choices for less. There aren't many that are rated really well that are free for us. I can get many of the offerings though Vudu or Netflix For the same price or even less.",1438819200,,913,4.094972067039106

6205291,2,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Until the end, I gave this movie the benefit of the doubt, waiting for my pay-off.  But when the ending came, I thought: what?  That's the conclusion?  I felt short-changed.
I gave it two stars instead of the one the script deserves, only because I like Gillian Anderson, and I also like the actor who plays her father, Victor Garber.  They were more or less sufficient in their roles.  Anderson was believable as her character.  I didn't care for the script's tendency to blame her husband for how she fared in the bulk of the movie, however.
Garber, who exudes integrity, nevertheless didn't strike me as the kind of world-changing genius that he'd have to be to do what he did in the movie.  Ditto for Osment.  Additionally, the idea that Garber and Osment allegedly did what they did as a duo (free of the help of other geniuses) wasn't close to being believable.
Einstein gets passing attention in this movie.  In actual life, Einstein didn't achieve what he did, all alone.  Yes, he made tremendous advances with theoretical physics problems, and yes, he was a visionary.  However, there were many other scientists around the world who were looking at similar challenges, and these scientists were in communication with him.  Einstein's correspondence acknowledges how their input was helpful to his progress.  But this dog of a script would have us believe that there is such a thing as a ""one man show"" (or a two-man show) when it comes to humanity's quantum leap discoveries.  It's wrong in so many ways.
The minor role of Anderson's husband (a character who mostly appeared in absentia) was under-utilized.  There was nothing about this man that was memorable, likeable, or symbolic of the true time explorer he was supposed to be.  Nothing.  As a viewer, I wanted to connect to him more (for the sake of the story), but there was nothing to connect to.  Waste of a character.
Regarding couple chemistry, there was more genuine chemistry between Osment's character as a child, and the little girl he favored, than there was later, when Osment and that same neighbor supposedly coupled up.  This sentence went through my mind when I saw them as adults: ""Oh, I guess they were together so long, that they take each other for granted now, like brother and sister.""  That's how they came across, suggested intimacies notwithstanding.
I am very surprised that the average rating for this movie is as high as it is.  Twelve-year-old's might not have issues with the plot, but when it comes to adult viewing, I think there is a lot better fare on Amazon than this movie.",1438214400,,2573,4.762979683972912

I accepted the slow format and realized the director was trying to create characte and mood as the story moved along. That is the main flaw with the film. However, once the groundwork and character development was laid down, the film began to pick up and by the end of the film I was caught off guard and blown away with the solution. I would recommend, but warn you it will take dedication to get to the interesting part.

6205368,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,"The unfortunately titled ""I'll Follow You Down"" (henceforth referred to as IFYD) is a tick-above-average time travel movie with hints of suspense and some wonderful performances by, most notably, Haley Joel Osment, Susanna Fournier and Victor Garber.  Gillian Anderson is also quite good in her portrayal of Marika, Osment's mother who is wrestling with the sudden, 12 year disappearance of her husband (Sewell).

Not knowing his whereabouts takes a tremendous toll on the family, but Garber and Osment develop a time machine capable of projecting them into the past in an attempt to find Osment's father, and basically ""correct"" the future.

As with all time travel movies you have to suspend inherent disbelief in its scientific possibility and hopefully get sufficiently mesmerized by the story to minimize the scientific impracticality of the feat.

Whereas IFYD doesn't master the art of storytelling it is well written and acted, and carries some emotional punch.  At times it can be overwrought but for the most part director Mehta is good at balancing the technical and the emotional.  Over all a very nicely done little film with emotional punch. 3.5 stars rounded up because it left me feeling quite positive. Had it been titled something like ""The Correction"" it might have made more impact.",1437955200,,1302,5.1761904761904765

6205575,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,"It's a familiar concept, but I liked the way this story plays out. All the characters were interesting and the way they see the world and their own specific issues was pretty realistic to me. It was easy to guess pretty early on what happened but that does not take away any enjoyment of the movie. It actually left me wishing it was just maybe 10 or 15 minutes longer so I could see what happens after...",1436572800,,405,4.2727272727272725

More low-key and realistically emotional than most science fiction films, like the best of them, the story is far more about the people and their very believable relationships than about the technology.  While keeping it's focus on the people involved, it still manages to provide an intelligently written and reasonably plausible scientific scenario while keeping the integrity and motives of the major characters engaging and sympathetic.  No continuity issues at all, no red herrings, and still the ending manages to surprise.  Very well done, fine acting and a moving story.  Highly recommended.",1436313600,,695,5.457943925233645

6205644,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,"The pace is slow, the production values feel more like TV than film, the plot is improbable, and the world doesn't threaten to end. There are no explosions, evil geniuses, or chase scenes. The story isn't particularly suspenseful. The time travel discussion feels a little silly. I agree with the reviewer who said this movie would have worked better as a stage production; the story is overshadowed by expectations people usually have for a film - it doesn't need to be loud, flashy, or slick, so to the degree that it is, those qualities are extraneous and intrusive. What makes it compelling is that the characters are believable, in part because the acting is understated. The story considers the consequences of time travel on a personal, pedestrian scale. What would happen to a real family if one member left the timeline they shared? In a metaphorical sense, most of us already know; that's why it works. It's got the usual Time Travel Genre philosophical Road Not Taken questions, plus it looks at the losses or gains that come from commitment to a personal vision or passion versus to the people in our lives. It's kind of like a Twinkie filled with caviar.",1436140800,,1167,4.782178217821782

The intense dilemma and personal tragedy meter are elevated, similar to ""Deja Vu"" (2006 - Denzel Washington and Paula Patton).  If you want less heavy on the mindwalk, try ""About Time"" (2013 - Domhnall Gleeson, Rachel McAdams, and Bill Nighy), or ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" (2009).

I can't recommend it but I'll do my best to predict whether or not you will.

Read even more on it, too (The Butterfly effect)  Must say most have faded from my memory, except the Pal feature film, Time after Time, and the Time Traveller's Wife.

This one will stick in the memory, though.  It's not really ""about"" time travel, but the choices men (yeah, men) make chasing ideas, (wars, money, you name it) at the expense of love and family.  Good performance by Haley Joel Osment (the psychic kid in Sixth Sense) as the son who lost his father...and has a chance to reclaim him, ahhh, but the cost!  Nice turn by X-files' Gillian Anderson as the grieving widow and also Victor Garber as the young man's obsessed grandfather.

Nice build-up, great ending, and, as always with time-travel stories, a sense of, ""yeah, but what if...""",1435190400,,899,4.730769230769231

The scripting is great, the casting is great, the acting is great, the pace is great...and when you add in the fact that,  at one point, I  just *knew* I had it figured out but was dead wrong...you get an excellent movie. It's very believable...despite the fact that it's impossible. I'll be actively recommending it to family and friends. Sit down and give it a watch.. .its very unlikely that you'll be disappointed.

Here is a man certain of the good outcome of his efforts in pursuit of a goal to make a better world. He seems to strive for stability, a safer world, greater happiness. He thinks he is making a grand gesture.
In time we all learn that there are no true shortcuts. That no one wins in the end. That it is the striving, not the achieving that counts.
Life choices. When someone stands in one of the many decision boxes of life - forks in the road, if you will - it is not so clear that regardless of which path one chooses, at the end of a life, all the good and bad balance out. Any choice will have a cost. Not choosing has a cost.",1434844800,,735,3.9395973154362416

He's supposed to be a genius but doesnt realize that the timeline he leaves from would continue without him coming back same as his father on a different universal line. That should have been the final shot of the film - His grandfather and girlfriend years later talking about how he left and never came back because he went back in time and offed himself.  Dummy!

*Spoiler alert: If the family goes down an alternate path because the Father is murdered in the past and and doesn't come back to the present wouldn't the son just vanish and cease to exist?  Also, if the son goes back and commits suicide to get the Father to return, something else should be messed up as the Son is now dead and doesn't return...  Hmmm.

The acting is not the greatest in the world and the reactions of the characters to stressful events is not always believable, but the movie's strong points far outweigh its weaknesses. It contains a viable and scientifically plausible way to create time travel, and it throws numerous plot twists into the mix that keep one's attention. It is a movie well worth viewing.",1434412800,,502,4.715909090909091
6205855,5,B00HSJ2CVQ,"One of the best - if not the best - movies I've seen about alternate realities and the choices we make in creating this one we're in.  What sets it apart is the emphasis on the humanity behind those choices, providing just enough theoretical foundation for the time-travel premise to satisfy hard-sci-fi fans yet keep the softies engaged. It reminded me of the very best, thoughtful and far-reaching science fiction novellas and short stories of the 60's and 70's (and, sadly, fewer examples in subsequent decades).

Some reviewers have panned this screenplay's ""slow"" aspects, a reaction that belies the expectation that a ""sci-fi"" label portends an escapist, mindless plot. They should moan, instead, about how the industry's lowest-common-denominator categorizations shortchange potential audiences from experiencing truly ground-breaking films. Movies that straddle disparate themes like this one (commitment and choice, love and satisfaction, quantum reality and time travel) cannot be pigeon-holed in a term like ""sci-fi."" Such simple-minded classifications are for the simple-minded.  If this isn't you, then expect way more from this film than you can imagine: human, 3D characters, poignant choices, thought-provoking insights into possibilities beyond our day-to-day familiarity with ""reality"" as we think we know it.

So if you're looking for another escapist bit of drivel about time-travel and paradoxes and phony science, then do yourself (and anyone you want to tell about this story) a favor and skip it.  If you love sci-fi that stretches your mind and your awareness of reality, then please - please - don't miss ""I'll Follow You Down"" - you won't be disappointed.",1434412800,,1682,5.453846153846154

6205882,5,B00HSJ2CVQ,I loved this movie and the fact that it did not have the feel of a B-rated time travel movie.  The incidents that occur throughout the movie that keeps drawing Erol back to the fact that he has to find his dad and fix their lives are seemingly well-planned. At some point you being to realize that his current life cannot continue on its path and things need to change so some of the occurrences are somewhat predictable but the emotional content drawn from this movie keeps your mind in check and you empathize with Erol. The end surprised me and it was only the minute before it was about to happen that I realized what Erol must do.,1434240000,,635,4.336134453781512

6205890,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,"This was an engaging and thoughtful time travel film.  Many of these films are plagued with inconsistencies. This one does a good job of covering most of the potential plot holes.  In addition, the good performances drive you to really like the characters and care about their plight. That's key for driving the more technically minded sci fi fan to forgive the errors, or plot holes that movies like this tend to have.  In the end it is a highly emotional story about what's important to you success, or family. That's a struggle many driven and employed parents can relate to. Especially in this day and age when both parents need to work just to make ends meet. This is a good film. The director remembers that too much techno jargon will bore the audience, so he focuses on the characters and making empathize with them.",1434153600,,824,4.63013698630137
6205891,5,B00HSJ2CVQ,"This is a thoughtful study of the personal impacts to a family caused by the inadvertent consequences of time travel. Forget the space operas - this film never goes for the cheap thrills but rather focuses on the human aspects and side effects of what would happen if we were to alter our timelines.  Gillian Anderson is understated as the mother of young boy whose scientist-father disappears on a trip to a conference.  To avoid being a spoiler, let me just say that the low rating of this movie on other sites (e.g., IMDB and Rotten tomatoes) is simply inexplicable.  What the heck do people want?  If you are looking for an alternative to big-budget but mind-numbingly stupid summer blockbusters, give this small, intelligent, independent film a chance.",1434153600,,757,4.890625

6205909,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,"While some reviewers have pointed out that this movie lacks the sci-fi weapons and action that we've come to expect from the genre these days, that is not a flaw.  The story is about love, intellectual passion, and inevitability.  There were some cliche type moments, such as Grace announcing that she's pregnant, which was an obvious plot maneuver to make the character Erol focus on the decision that he alone had to make--travel back and save his father and set the time line right, or accept that these things happened and live the life that he has since started.  At this point, I have to comment on the one real flaw that I saw with this story.  Grace has a miscarriage, which really makes Erol's decision easier.  The movie could have dealt so much more with regret over past actions and inactions, but by taking his ""becoming a father"" away, it veered in another direction.  He says something to the effect that he's always had the feeling that something was telling him that this wasn't the life he was supposed to live.  In essence, it got a bit metaphysical, when it should have stayed philosophical.

To be clear, though, he doesn't mean that he wasn't supposed to live parts of his life.  He believes that he was supposed to fall in love with Grace, and he tries to write out a time line on a brick wall with the important events after his father's disappearance.  I was expecting him to try to insert some trick into his return that would ensure that certain things would happen again.

I thought it was a strong point that Erol kills himself in front of his father to force his hand, but I also wonder if this is another mechanism to make a decision for someone in the film.  In the end, I'm a sucker for a happy ending, and this movie had it.  They didn't overdo the moment when little Grace comes up behind the father when he returns, hinting that things would click between Erol and Grace in this corrected time line.",1433980800,,1935,4.494285714285715

His acting was what I would consider ""local art house"".  It wasn't bad and wasn't good - just average.  Also, on more than a few occasions I was taken out of the movie by his forced delivery and the noticeably drug out scenes.  Combine all of this with the lack of chemistry between his counterpart and the oddly chosen background score - which had a tendency to over power the dialogue and seemingly not fit the mood of the scene - I was distracted and stopped paying attention more often than I cared for.  Again, the premise was not bad but the movie seemed to fall a little flat.",1433808000,,766,4.5144927536231885

6205930,3,B00HSJ2CVQ,"This is an interesting little sci-fi film.  I had never heard of it before, but it has Haley Joel Osmont and Gillian Anderson among other actors that are less well known.

It is essentially story focused, so there isn't a lot of special effects.  I enjoyed it because it is one of those movies which is thought provoking and doesn't necessarily treat the viewers as children that need every detail spoon fed to them.

The only reason I didn't give it more than three stars is because I felt like the story could have gone further than it did.  There is plenty of resolution for the main characters, but it seemed some of the larger philosophical issues were not addressed.  Nonetheless, this movie is worth viewing once if you're a fan of thought provoking sci-fi films.",1433808000,,770,4.625

6206036,5,B00HSJ2CVQ,"As a Sci-Fi fan with a particular interest in time travel movies, I thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation of the HG Wells classic. Suspense builds as the viewer faces the possibility of changing the past, is it morally acceptable to do so, what would I say to my younger self and what would the consequences be in the present? These complex issues are logically presented while still managing to be entertaining.

You will want to pay close attention, because little oddities later become key events that will startle you and leave you feeling like you have gone back in time and changed your present! When you add in the romance, mystery, and a surprising ending, you have a very enjoyable and thought provoking movie experience.",1433116800,,727,4.862903225806452

6206048,3,B00HSJ2CVQ,"I read where this was a tale with twists and turns and keeps you guessing. I found the opposite to be true. The movie is fairly well put together, but any SciFi fan worth their salt has read or seen many tales about time travel and its inherent risks. I found all but the very last few minutes of the movie very predictable. A man solves a math equation that allows him to create a stable wormhole to the past. Bad things happen in the past that change the current timeline. His son figures this out, and follows him back to attempt to fix things. I can name at least three similar tales off the top of my head. No points for originally, but better than mothra attacking Tokyo again.

6206052,3,B00HSJ2CVQ,"First I'd have to say the film was okay, but not mind bendingly thought provoking. Not wanting to add a spoiler, I'll just say the question of who goes where, when and why is not explained very well. There didn't seem to be any consideration of the well known ""butterfly effect"" which is usually a component of time travel movies. I wondered if anyone bothered about acquiring period correct money to pay for their coffee in 1946. Why did the father stay in a hotel when he would naturally have stayed with his father? And sorry for you who don't play chess, but at one hour in when the son is setting up a chess position, the board is set up sideways. Yes, there is actually a right way and a wrong way to position a chess board. If this were a typical Hollywood thriller this might be forgivable, but this film aspires to intellectual pretensions, you'd think they'd get that right. I know, I know, only the chessplayers out there will care about this, but don't be too hard on me. I'm sure there's not one chessplayer who doesn't take notice of this in every film that has a chess playing scene. Imagine if it were a football game and the teams were facing off from the sidelines!

The idea was good, and I really appreciated the actors, especially Rufus Sewell.  Who doesn't like Zen!!  Gillian Anderson is very good as well!  In this story there is a well educated strong independent woman whose husband disappears.  She becomes obsessed with his disappearance and somehow believes that he has left them and run off with another woman.  This obsession drives her mad, very depressed, and finally, she can't take anymore and ends her own life.  While I might be out of touch, does this still happen?  She had looks, money, job, respect in the community, family support.  All I know is that I have never met a woman like this and question their existence??  Lastly, who doesn't like Albert Einstein?

6206121,1,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Wow, was this bad!

The characters are shallow, unbelievable, cliche, and boring -- all at the same time! One of many examples: The wife finds her vanished husband's wallet and cell phone tucked in a desk drawer at Princeton, and the writers don't even give her a single onscreen moment to say, ""Hey, did he walk out on us?"" They don't even let anyone else ask that question. Somehow we're all supposed to get that he...what?...they never consider any possible explanations at all.

The Albert Einstein references made me groan, as did the whole gifted mathematician shtick.

And, off topic, but grownup child actors look weird most of the time. As children, they're chosen for their archetypical ""child-like"" features. Like the ""I see dead people"" kid looks so whiny and sensitive and in psychic pain. As a grownup, guess what? He still looks all whiny. Only now he's about a foot too short for the rest of the actors and his scruffy beard makes no sense on his whiny, babyfat face. Oh and also he can't act.

Thru Yoga, one can see 16 dimensions, May be that 16th dimension is what we call God(ultimate energy/light/power).  India has proof where some great sages have written about evolution of universe and how this cycle will repeat again and again. He can go into future/past and see things. Human life, of say 100 years is nothing compared to creations one second/moment which is may be millions or billions of years( Tripura Rahsya book). Yoga has proved again, things appearing from nowhere. We only know 3 dimensions, we see 4D's too in some theatres. If we can get a guru, who can guide, one can go beyond 3D and see the wonders, just by sitting and meditating. It is not fiction and Science lets us see things, to certain point where our vision can see in the light available, what about the beyond light, dark, many things are hidden in that light. Like scientist now say many universes exist.",1432857600,,1205,4.683962264150943
6206155,2,B00HSJ2CVQ,"This is one of those movies that make me think if there was a better team directing and writing, etc. it would it have been better. The concept is fun. We viewers just love time travel (though, I think it is comical how in movies time travel is always in a vessel and it is turbulent, loud and with the finishing flash of light. I would think traveling in time would be more like inhaling and exhaling a breath of air, but I divert.)But was it about time travel or science equations or just a father leaving. It didn't seem to avert its real purpose - a bit mushy. Nice to see Haley, would like to see him more often, and I agree with another reviewer that he and his girl had no chemistry. The other performances were solid. There was just something missing, and I just sat and blinked a few times when it was over.",1432857600,,816,4.203821656050955

And this doesn't finally happen until 75% of the way though the movie. The acting is stilted (even for Gillian Anderson), the writing is stilted, and the plot drags. I'm sorry but Haley Joel Osment is not a good actor, and I couldn't get past fixating on his face with kid-sized eyes in an adult face. Ugh, Amazon reviews failed me big-time here.

6206181,3,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Wish I could have giving it another half star (Could be a spoiler)------ It was a good movie not the best T. T. I have ever seen it did have a good story line just drew it out to long before getting down to business.  Time travel can be tricky in this case it wasn't thought through his dad didn't come back from a trip his family didn't know what happen to him. His young son was a genius so was his father in law, between the two they theorized what happen to him after twelve years later. The father in law wanted to repudiate what he did his son wanted nothing to do with it but his mom passed and his wife lost their baby he wanted to fix that but his wife found out about what he had in mind and pleaded for him not to do it.  To me there is no way to fix the past if you did would everybody's life on earth  change or would the time period continue you left behind the only difference the wife would be left alone to live out her life. If he did find his father in the past and talked him into going back to the exact minute he left he couldn't come back because there would be two of him one young and him older.

The story follows the characters through the struggles of finding a solution to a problem that in this case is a time travel problem. Other than one violent event it would make a great family film. Haley Joel Osment demonstrates that he can do great work in an adult role. Being a fan of Gillian Anderson from her X-Files days it was nice to see her in a different role, although it was still a sci-fi role.",1432166400,,487,4.304347826086956

6206185,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,"The story in ""I'll Follow You Down"" deals with a lot of science material tied together through emotional character study but you don't have to be a smarty to follow along. Maybe to argue the laws of physics and such one would need to bone up on wormhole theories, quantum physics & mechanics but most people will be drawn in by the character drama that unfolds in the film. The cast is top notch and give moving performances with no overdrawn grandiosity, just straight forward compassionate well developed characters that really make the story enjoyable. The sci-fi or scientific theory aspect of ""I'll Follow You Down"" is written more matter of fact and what I imagine would be elementary so a good foundation of ""Star Trek"" or other sci-fi knowledge really works well in that element of the material. I did phase out a bit over ""time line corrections without complicating things"" because that goes over my head, but I still found everything relatable without being too wordy.

There is very little special effects in the film, most things boil down to a standard musical score that pulls at emotional elements of the film, there is a small practical effect and lighting effect against props to sell the ""time machine"" aspect that works just fine and without overstating the moment. ""I'll Follow You Down"" is really a family drama that has some sci-fi attached to it but mostly it is a well directed, well acted and completely executed drama that is enjoyable to watch. I enjoyed the film, the cast was great. The story is sweat and Haley Joel Osment gives a a commendable performance.",1432080000,2,1587,4.7709090909090905

Usually the time travel movies are predictable and, as another reviewer stated, focused on the sci-fi aspect more than the people affected by its use.  This movie did not follow that trend.  Having stated that, the only thing I was put off by was the mom and Grandfather's stilted reaction in the beginning of the movie after they realized he was missing.
I first thought the ending was abrupt but realized the director/producer/writer made a very smart choice.

6206425,3,B00HSJ2CVQ,"While I liked the performance of Gillian Anderson in this movie, and I wanted to love the movie, I found it to be only O.K.

The storyline was interesting and was along the lines of what I would normally like, but it fell flat in some way.  I will say that the movie kept me somewhat surprised, but there was just something about it that did not capture me or my imagination.

SPOILERS!

The premise in my opinion was that because a scientist, father and husband had gone back in time and not returned, he pushed his family onto an alternate timeline that should never have occurred causing negative consequences for the rest of their lives.  It caused a hole in their lives where he was meant to be.

The problem is that the movie did not sell me on that premise.  Yes, bad things happened.  Bad things happen in peoples' lives all the time.  Who is to say bad things would not happen if the scientist had never gone back in time.  The movie just did not sell me on that concept.  Yes, I wanted it to be fixed.  I wanted the family to be happy.  It was just something about how it played out with the son that made the movie only O.K. to me.",1431129600,,1142,4.207373271889401

Gillian Andersen was brilliant as usual and I always enjoy seeing Rufus Sewell. Victor Garber fit in well as Gillian's father. What spoiled the entire movie for me was casting Haley Joel Osment as the adult son of Andersen and Sewell. Could they have found a more genetically unlikely actor? I kept thinking a reference would be made to him being adopted but it never came up. I have nothing against Osment as an actor but unfortunately, it was hard for me to suspend disbelief for the story with this obvious casting gaffe. So I'm awarding three stars for the plot minus a half star for the casting for a total of 2 1/2 stars.",1431043200,,728,4.564885496183206

6206580,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,"A well written sci-fi story that explores the paradoxes of time travel and how science is only part of the ""equation"" when
it comes to time and human relationships. What would you sacrifice to correct mistakes made in the past?  Would you risk
losing the things in your life that have gone well for the possibility of the improvement of others?  Will some things happen
anyway no matter what you do?

Well cast, acted, and directed,  Well developed characters and a few from history you might recognize. If you have an interest in quantum mechanics and all issue related to time, you will likely enjoy this.  I would compare it to the Butter Fly Effect and many other Harlan Ellison stories.

Her whining became irksome, and I found nothing likeable about the couple.  Gillian Andersons performance was lifeless, her husband;s mumbling, with a projection of aloofness  created no sense of interest in this viewer.  Someone compared it to a stage play and I'd agree.

6206620,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,"As I watched this flick I was struck by the fact that it's a very good representation of what family life should be, ie: people who actually love, respect and care about one another. Each actor was cast in traditional roles (husband, wife, son, grandfather) that seems to be a thing of the past on the big screen. Also the plot was well served by the limited special effects utilized. Although the surface story centered on time travel the real content was in the relationships that were emotionally played without going over the top. And as always, it's a pleasure to see the the lovely Ms Anderson in anything she cares to grace. This woman projects (imo) her own style of beauty that is at once quite appealing while being unique to her. It was also nice to see Haley Osment finally get over that horribly awkward phase he went through. While not a dynamic actor by any means he was well suited to this part and held his own throughout.",1430352000,,939,4.497076023391813

The premise would have worked better as a fantasy.

The always lovely Gillian Anderson must have leapt into this role, and the opportunity of being associated with an extraordinary love story.  It's almost a spoiler to admit up front, here is a tale of time travel gone terribly awry.

There exists this machismo, perhaps is the best adjective.  When we imagine the potential of time travel, were ever tempted to presume our contemporary collection of data would give us an edge over any less mature version of ourselves we might run into at an earlier stage of the game.  Against this presumption the script writers have launched a frontal assault.  Although it's tempting to loiter on the relativistic stage of quantum possibilities, I found the solutions presented to be drastic and shocking.

For my part, even if I could somehow transmit my data backwards to a school days incarnation of myself, I'd probably do it all again.  Even with the thought that love might come once again, only for a season, I'd exchange every ounce of magic again for that brief chance.",1430179200,,1065,4.781420765027322

I was surprised to see Gillian Anderson who I've liked since the X-Files, and Osment who I haven't seen as an adult actor and I think not since the Sixth Sense.  All the acting in this movie was really well done.  I'm a huge sci-fi fan and I usually look for something like Prometheus, Interstellar, Pitch Black, Pandorum, etc., but this movie kept me interested in finding out the ending.  For such a low key movie I'm surprised I'm giving it this high of a review.  There were no big special effects, no over-the-top fight scenes, no laugh-out-loud moments, and not even that unique of a plot.  The actors and the story keep you wanting to see what happens in the end.  I was impressed with Osment's acting as a lot of kid actors turn out to be disappointing as adult actors, but he's good.

*****SPOILER**************************************************** The one thing I found really odd was when Erol explains everything to Grace, instead of her being amazed and asking how this is even possible, or just thinking her boyfriend is a nut and lost his mind, she just assumes he's going to do it and change their lives and they get into a huge fight over it.  I can envision if other people did this movie they might have had Grace go off and mention something to her boss, then her boss tries to steal their work and that gets into a whole sub-story, or they might have Grace try to stop Erol and sabotage his work, but this movie just stays on track all the way through, which was refreshing.********************END SPOILER*************************************",1429833600,11,1687,4.710884353741497

You want a candy bar, but your girlfriend chops off your fingers because your room is painted white.  That's how this movie feels...  It's so badly disconnected that it actually gets frustrating to watch.  It's a B film with some good acting, like a good pastry chef with amazing ingredients that just cut the cake wrong in the end.  Sure there's a cool story line, and the actors do great in their scenes, but that's not enough to save the movie.  Overall, just hard to watch and follow...",1429833600,,781,4.594202898550725

6206806,4,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Well done and worth watching as a whole . I did feel that Haley Joel Osment was not quite the actor this movie needed. He's missing something in the range of his acting that let's you believe he's a tortured genius. His demeanor and emotive ability did not range very far, plus the very wooden Susanna Fournier wasn't written to do much either so there wasn't much more than trope style acting lesson problems for Susanna Fournier to act out.  Aside from that I really appreciated Victor Garber and Gillian Anderson for their acting pieces.  At least they each had their own struggle and almost their own stories to carry in which Osment existed but never truly felt like he was in the same of acting .  Rufus Sewell also looked like he could have used a better scripted part and his talents were somewhat under-utilized with what was left for him. The plot skeleton was excellent and the summation while somewhat expected was specifically well done. I just wish there was more meat on the bones and that perhaps a stronger actor than Osment was tapped to carry it off.",1429833600,,1069,4.5863874345549736

6206828,5,B00HSJ2CVQ,"I'LL FOLLOW YOU DOWN is a well-made science fiction film about time travel, dire loss, and the desperate desire to go back and ""fix"" things. When a brilliant physicist named Gabriel (Rufus Sewell- DARK CITY, THE SHE CREATURE) vanishes without a trace, it devastates his wife, Marika (Gillian Anderson- TV's THE X-FILES) and son, Erol (Haley Joel Osment- THE SIXTH SENSE). Years later, Marika is still haunted by the disappearance, nearly unable to function. Erol, while going through agony of his own, discovers that his grandfather has been working on something that just might hold the key to the entire mystery. Osment is quite good as the main character of the story, and makes me wonder where he's been all these years. Ms. Anderson plays a minor, though important role, that she pulls off w/ ease. Sewell is only in the movie for a few minutes. There's drama, tension, and an emotional quagmire to balance out the scientific elements. In the end, this is a tale of love, hope, and human ingenuity.

So basically saying just live the life your given don't try to go back in time and change it because you don't know how all those other universe's or the one your leaving behind will turn out or how your future will change by going back in time.. at least that's what I understood from it but very interesting never the less just thought some characters in the movie we're lacking a little authenticity in there emotional rolls.

There is a science fiction story going on the whole time but I wonder if that is just the medium to tell the real story of conflict and romance. Because of the time travel element there are also questions asked about the inevitability of the conditions of our life.  A lot to keep you engaged.

Kudos to writer and director, Richie Mehta, editor, Stuart A. McIntyre, and actors, Haley Joel Osment, Gillian Anderson (great performance!), Victor Garber, and Rufus Sewell, not to mention the rest of the cast. Well done.

The only problem with the actor playing their son, was it was so distracting to me, that his eyes seemed too close together, which caused me to be paying more attention to his features, than what he had to say. The story line was believable, and kept you on the edge of your seat. The ending of the movie came as a shock to me.

The science used in the story development was quite interesting and evoked a reality to the possibility of traveling into the past.  The ideas used to describe how such events in the past could change the life lines of people in the future were made quite believable and, of course, modern science and mathematics is replete with deductive reasoning about parallel time lines and altered time lines through the use of theoretical calculations.  How one would carry out such travels is always the perview of the story teller, and this movie is not different.

However, it became a total bore despite of an extraordinary cast due to a no exciting story and slow development. There is nothing new about the story that could keep me hooked for 90 minutes. Too much on how the family suffered from the disappearance of dad.

6207050,1,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Just awful. In theory, it sounded like a great concept but was terrible. Haley Joel Osment and the actress playing his wife are either bad actors or had no chemistry or both.

6207060,3,B00HSJ2CVQ,"The problem with this movie is that it has a great premise and a somewhat unique angle on a familiar theme, but struggles to deliver as powerfully as it could.  One issue being that there are too many of the typical unrealistic conversations, reactions, responses that are clearly only there to make it easy to take the story where it needs to go - a common problem with any story telling to be sure - perhaps due to time constraints or just plain unimaginative dialog writing.  It's like plenty of other stories out there - disappointing when you think of what it could have been if only seemingly small modifications were made.  It's easy to criticize, especially when you aren't in the shoes of the director, writer, etc. - especially when you don't have experience in what you're criticizing.  So sure, maybe I couldn't have done better, but I'm relatively certain it could've been done better.  And as long as I'm in the easy seat of judge, before I'm through I'll also say I'm not sure if I expected, but I wanted to see better acting from HJO.  Still, my take is that a watered down version of a compelling story is often still worth checking out.  All the more so if your imagination can help blur the bad parts, enhance the good, and fill in what's missing.",1429228800,,1266,4.526315789473684

This is sci-fi drama in the greatest way possible, it discusses theory and avoids the mechanics in a clever way.
It acts as a cautionary tale by delving into cause and effect. Gripping film which wastes no time moving the story along, Gillian Anderson's performance is amazing, and surrounded by a great cast you are with the characters at every turn.
As a time travel fan this film made it to the top of my list among time crimes and primer, it is a shame this film didn't get more recognition(bad dvd cover) as it is an amazing addition to the genre.
I will even forgive the solution to the problem haley Joel gets stuck on, even though it is correct, it would in no way be hindering him. I'll say no more on the subject. .in closing, if you are still reading this then this film is for you. Enjoy.",1428969600,,858,4.36875

Relativistic cosmology with all of its wormholes, black holes, dark matter, etc., etc., is nothing but mathematical fidgeting to keep economic systems in place based on old science which is NO LONGER VALID.

In this case I think it needed a better writer.  The story line of the mopey son missing his disappeared father feeling compelled to go back to get him solely because he wants to repair his modern-day relationship is more selfish and less sympathetic than most of the times this story line has been hauled out.

Wasting the talents of Haley Joel Osment and Victor Garber in soapy performances makes this a little more egregious.  I wouldn't waste my time on this one given the huge selection of material available for streaming now.

6207239,2,B00HSJ2CVQ,Could have been great but it just misses.  Gillian Anderson is wonderful and she looks great.  Haley Joel Osment isn't and doesn't.  They were trying to achieve a Frequency like emotional appeal about a father who dies young and the devastating hole his lose leaves behind.  But I just didn't like any of the characters well enough to care.  The movie would have been much better if we had built up some sort of an emotional attachment to the father before he disappears.  As it was I never felt that emotional connection to him or his family.  Osment's girlfriend in the movie is so unlikeable that one wonders why he is so connected to her.  All she comes across as is nagging and needy without a trace of warmth or empathy.  I am left to wonder what happened here.  The cast is good or at least used to be.  So what went wrong?  Was the script always this bad with weak science and unlikeable characters or did all the emotion end up on the cutting room floor?,1428710400,,963,4.378531073446328

The endless moralizing does little to help you care more about the characters. The only surprising twist comes at the end of the next-to-last scene, perhaps because nothing in the preceding acting is believable enough to justify that much melodrama.

So you could go back in time and save yourself the 2 hours you just wasted on this film.

Run... run far away from this film. The characters are so shallow and stupid that you end up hoping they will all just die-off. The only interesting thing about this film was seeing the ""sixth sense"" kid all grown up. Other than that, it was a complete waste of time, and particularly un-intelligent for something as sophisticated as time-travel. To give you an example:

In the film, more emphasis was put on the ""formula"" for time-travel (aka: math equations on a chalk-board) than any actual thought-provoking time-travel planning. Plots a little like this:

- Here's a genius. .... He doesn't look like one, ...he doesn't act like one, ... just trust us.
- Here's that same genius struggling to solve a time-travel equation.

Not being able to sleep, I pulled out my knitting and a cup of decaf and sat down to watch a movie. Cruising around Amazon Prime Video, I found Ill Follow You Down. Gillian Anderson and Haley Joel Osment. The blurb says: After the disappearance of a young scientist on a business trip, his son and wife struggle to cope, only to make a bizarre discovery years later  one that may bring him home. OK, that sounds interesting  or mind numbing, it is always so hard to tell. The movies I have flipped through lately have been real stinkers, but I like Gillian Anderson, so I settled back to watch.

Victor Garber Actor Victor Garber attends Vanity Fair Party for the ...Directed by Richie Mehta, the movie is listed as drama-mystery. The mystery is there  what happened to Marikas husband, and Erols father after he touched down in New Jersey and his father-in-law, played by the erudite Victor Garber, drops him at Princeton University in Albert Einsteins old laboratory space? What were the crates that he had delivered to the lab? (And what, by the way, was the fathers name? I didn't really catch it!)

This isn't really what I would call a drama per se. It is more of a morality tale in the end, set in a scientific/science fiction setting. Filmed on a minimal budget in Canada the story is slow to develop. As another reviewer says, the pacing and filming is more on the level of a morality play in three parts than the type of shock and awe portrayal that todays science fiction flicks seem to wallow in. Not to say I don't love some high action/adventure scifi that is so common today, but the slow pace and psychological and sociological questions brought to light kept me awake instead of putting me to sleep as I went into it thinking it would. There are questions of how life can change in an instant, and how our personal choices can make, or destroy, the lives of everyone around us in a widening gyre, from a single, selfish action. I have to say, the poster/cover for the movie, done all in blue, fits the concept.

As I said, this isn't SciFi Rock n Roll  but if you want a quiet, thoughtful movie with an interesting concept, you might try this out. It isn't the best developed film I have ever seen, but it is pleasant, and leaves the viewer with food for thought.",1428624000,,2446,4.466367713004484

6207304,5,B00HSJ2CVQ,"While watching this movie, I felt the same sense I used to have when watching the original Twilight Zone episodes back in the day. A very good short story (one with unanticipated twists and turns), turned into a simple screen play (one that could be filmed on a handful of simple sets, with not a hint of computer generated imagery), cast with well-known actors playing character roles. Add to that the emotional drama of tortured souls who want the world to be better, and the extra twists and turns allowed by a feature length film, and you have a genuinely captivating movie.

Don't get me wrong -- I've enjoyed Transformers, Avengers, etc. But after a decade of computer generated battle scenes, I'd forgotten how much I enjoyed old-fashioned science fiction story telling and stage-style acting. It was a genuine treat.

The movie is slower paced than action adventure flicks, especially up front, and there's not a radical new time travel twist here. What you will find is a good story, that follows an arc you probably didn't expect. And you'll feel the angst of the characters, and understand and believe how their loves and turmoils drive the actions that propel the story to its surprising end.

The film is serious and engaging, with very good performances from Gillian Anderson and Haley Joel Osment.

The young man eventually learns that his father was working on a time travel experiment, and so he attempts to recreate his father's work in order to discover what became of him.

My main criticism of the film, and the reason I cannot give it more than three stars, is that while it does an excellent job discussing the potential downsides which could result from tampering with the past, the film does not do a sufficient job of revealing the actual outcome of the young man's journey to rescue his father. Instead, the story leaves it up to the viewer to decide how the story might eventually unfold.

6207364,3,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Good overall movie but was a little disappointed in this one.
If you're looking for a time travel movie, it has an interesting (though not unique concept) but it is light on the details and doesn't spend very much time at all on the intrigue of time travel.  There is some talk of alternate timelines which was acceptable but more could have been done.  There was a lot of potential for the writer/director to add a couple more twists to the movie to make it more interesting both from a time travel perspective and from a story-telling perspective.
There were two times I remember when a mystery was being revealed; when Sal (the grandfather) revealed that he was working on Erol's father's research, he just sprung it on him all at once.  This should have been played out over several scenes to build the suspense and mystery.  Some time could have been removed from the beginning portion of the movie where they were establishing the family's perfect life and deep love for one another but it was a bit slow and could have been done more efficiently.
Another time was when Erol revealed who he was to his father.  Again, should have taken more time for this revelation to develop to make it more interesting.",1428192000,,1211,4.613953488372093

6207369,5,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Good sci-fi yarn, good stay-at-home date flick, solid entertaining B-movie, suitable for the entire family (a rarity these days). Though well acted, the plot was full of holes, avoid thinking too much and just enjoy the story.  I'll skip the usual time travel issues (Grandfather Paradox, etc.) and dwell on the one little thing that bothered me the most.

If you traveled back in time from 2012 to 1946 to intercept your father and convince him to return to the correct time line of year 2000, what in the blue blazes would compel you to take a circa-2012 MacBook computer with you??!!  Wouldn't it have been more prudent to take back paper-based pictures of the basement wall?  You're at Princeton for crying out loud, the place was crawling with the top scientific and mathematical minds of that time. Imagine what could have happened if just one of them came across a 2012 MacBook!

You commit suicide in 1946 because you can't return to the alternate 2012 where everything is wrong. You obviously can't return to 2000 and risk encountering your younger self. And if you remained alive in 1946, your presence could alter the timeline again in ways you could not possible imagine or plan around.  By deliberately taking yourself out of the equation, and forcing dad to return to 2000, the timeline can be reset to its original configuration.  I have issues with that scenario but as a movie plot point it seems to work.

But there's that darn 2012 MacBook hanging around.  The grownup ""kid"" is dead in 1946 so he can't take the computer back to alt-2012 and dad can't very well leave the thing behind; he would have had to hang around in 1946 long enough to find a way to completely destroy the machine, much like what happened in Terminator II where the T-888 commits suicide by lowering himself into a cauldron of melted steel.  But the longer dad remains in 1946, the greater the probability that something will happen to him or the computer is not destroyed.  See the dilemma?

So dad really can't risk staying in 1946 for too long and potentially screwing up THAT timeline; he has no other choice but to take the computer with him back to year 2000.  Now then -- although dad is back home, the MacBook is NOT. He'll have to hide it somewhere until it can be completely destroyed;  you can't leave ANY piece of it behind for someone to accidentally discover, we learned this from the Terminator franchise.

For those that care, this is a ""clean"" movie other than a few f-bombs. So if that matters to you or kids who may be watching, be aware.

Where the science fiction comes into play is how and why Rufus Sewell is missing from most of the movie. Also, his now grown son, Haley Joel Osmet and father-in-law Victor Garber, try to reverse engineer the how and why of how he's missing.

Gillian Anderson has a small bit part in the movie. So fans of her won't get much out of her bit part.

As one reviewer put it, this is/could be a stage play.
I'm okay with that, as the drama of the characters is what carries the movies. That combined with the science fiction aspects/theory discussions -- at least for me -- made for a very interesting movie. I'd watch the stage play version of this!

The movie asks one core question: What kind of ripple effects do decisions in our past, have on our lives today? Could we change those effects or at least re-shape them if we could travel back in time and get a do-over?

I have also been a Sci-Fi fan since 1964 starting at the age of 8. This is one of the best paradox/split reality stories I have read or seen in this entire time other than the Dean's (RAH): ""All You Zombies"", a short story that has also been made into the excellent movie: ""Predestination"".

Time travel has been a favorite of sf authors for over a hundred years but, most (if not most of all) deal with the spectacular, or the fantastical. These two stories deal with the 'every day person's'  point of view; this one dealing with the question and the most plausible result of what has been described as the butterfly effect. The person traveling has no effect on the timeline visited, but completely disrupts what should have been the individual's future or the future of those around the traveler's life from the initial start of travel event. In this scenario the causality surrounding the flow of time creates an unstable reality that will endeavor to correct itself crating a ripple effect that expands from the initial start of the event that could expand to the total unraveling of reality if the flow is not corrected. In this case, it is the continuous existence of the protagonist's father in the timeline he started from. The solution to this issue in the film was excellently done, if (maybe) a little extreme. The Robert Heinlein story mentioned here covers the highly philosophized/discussed topic of the 'chicken or the egg' concept which is as far as I will go describing this movie here.

It explores trying to change a powerful event in the past to then encounter random events in the past which negate the effort of stopping the main event.  It brings up the idea that each act has an effect on something else or the humans around it, and we can never fully understand the ripple effect of acts we commit.

6207409,5,B00HSJ2CVQ,"I just finished posting some criticism for ""Alien Rising"", a movie I streamed based on the impression I got from this movie, (IFYD).  With a very trim budget, this film tells the best SF with time-travel I've seen since ""Edge of Tomorrow"".  And it is worth mentioning that ""Edge"" was a huge juggernaut of a mainline-Hollywood production . . . I actually never checked ""Edge's"" budget, but with Tom Cruise, all the CGI, big sweeping screenplay stuff, marketing, etc....Think about it: had IFYD only spent $50mil more on marketing,  plus $50 - $100mil on eye candy (be it cgi/casting/screenplay), I bet it would have been a beast of a profit.

There are a lot of adults who, if you just make sure the script follows the known physical laws, and where it flies off into the areas of artistic freedom it at least remains consistent, are going to love the movie.  I should also mention human behavior,  since that is the area of ""Alien Rising"" that just missed horribly -- I never could figure out why anyone was acting the way they were.  One of the best parts of IFYD is where the guy shoots himself in the head when they are back in 1946 -- it pushes his father to focus on what he needs to do, PLUS it pinches off that loop/paradox of there being too many bodies.",1419897600,,1262,4.460869565217391

6207420,3,B00HSJ2CVQ,"I'll Follow You Down is NOT a typical scifi-suspense-thriller. There are no automatic weapons or time cops. There is no high-tech research centre. There is in fact no ""action"" as delivered by most cinema these days, and only minimal, situationally necessary violence. The film is presented and paced like a stage play. The first hour (or more) is used to set the stage for the decisive events that occur in the final act, if you will. It is certainly slow-paced and ""talkie,"" and calls the viewer back to another, earlier era in film-making. Honestly, the acting is not gripping, the characters aren't deeply developed, and suspension of disbelief in the technological ideas is difficult, if not impossible. Nonetheless, there is a level at which this modestly-budgeted made-in-Canada effort does succeed. That is, I found myself truly caring how everything would play out for the characters, and for how they would resolve their struggles with their dilemmas... which were mostly further losses following (minor spoiler) a father's disappearance early on. The themes were universal enough to be engaging. I'd say that the majority of the issues addressed were unstated, and the film's resolution of most of them was equivocal at best. The time travel theme has been much better developed elsewhere, yet, this film still had something, perhaps unique, to say. Finally, the ""disappeared"" father must face a stark dilemma, and the final minutes of the film deliver the moral of the story, which, if simplistic, did not ring false, at least in ""this timeline."" In terms of contemporary productions, an effort like Continuum develops a far more sophisticated and complex vision of time travel --- one that makes you stretch, and stretch again. This film doesn't do that at all, nor does it attempt to. The idea of time travel is really secondary to the primary and overriding moral theme. But... please allow me to conclude it like this: Had this been a stage production, it would in fact have worked --- and that is not easy to say for most ideas developed in science fiction film.

Rather, it is theatrical in style, featuring fairly simple locations and extensive -- though fascinating -- dialogue about the philosophical ramifications of time travel. Erol weighs the pros and cons before contemplating a journey through time, unlike leading characters in most time-travel flicks, who never think ahead and suffer for it. Erol is motivated by grief rather than megalomania. He just wants his family back together again and believes that time travel is the means. Mr. Osment, all grown up, handles an adult, difficult role admirably. Ms. Anderson and Susanna Fournier, as Erol's girlfriend Grace, turn in strong performances.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray edition include deleted scenes and a making-of featurette.",1407715200,,1352,5.4951923076923075

However Sal (Victor Garber) the grandfather and scientist in his own right has pretty much discovered what has happened. With Sal's help, Erol (Haley Joel Osment), son of Gabe will attempts to bring his father back and in the process correct for twelve years of mishaps.

We are left with many questions as to what would be the correct course. The tone of the movie is the age old it is not man's place to mess with the universe. Too bad as it had potential.

I was impressed with the cast; Gillian Anderson can act outside of the x Files.  The background music was homemade and depressing. The scenery was believable.",1407283200,,839,4.529801324503311

6207450,3,B00HSJ2CVQ,"An interesting movie (in some respects), that is if you manage to watch it until the end
Because the interest factor falls rapidly after the first 10 minutes, but still at the end
it leaves you with a pleasant feeling, and makes you think about the important things in life.

The story is one of mystery. The father/scientist (Rufus Sewell, not playing the bad guy here) disappears one day without a trace, leaving behind a wife(Gillian Anderson, the goddess of sci fi that looks
really great at this age) and a son (Haley Joel Osment, let me spare you the brain pressure to try to
remember him, he has the kid in AI) . They live a crappy life after that. Enter the grand father (tv star
Victor Garber) who manages to convince the son that his dad has travelled back in time to meet
Einstein. And yes it is all math and crazy physics for a while after that, since both of them decide
to re-create the machine that the father made and try to reach him back into the past.
An easy, kind of boring plot, but again with a really nice end. AND IT HAS A GREAT TWIST!

Typically, it is a sci fi movie, although of the more theoretical level.
And if you don't believe me that a sci fi movie can exist without mad aliens and explosions,
then what you call the fact that a college student/genius has a flip phone in 2012?

This 2013 movie has a 5.9 Rating in IMDB and and 5.1 on Rotten Tomatoes if you care for
such ratings.

6207456,3,B00HSJ2CVQ,"This is a straightforward science fiction time travel/parallel worlds story.  It is so straightforward that I could imagine this having been one of the filler stories in the July, 1957 edition of Amazing Magazine.

Rufus Sewell says good-bye to his wife, Gillian Anderson, and his young son, who will grow up to be Haley Joel Osment.  Then he disappears and Anderson becomes depressed and Osment grows up without a father, but with a really hot girlfriend.  Then, Osment's grandfather figures out that Rufus was playing around with time travel and that if they go back in time and intercept him before he disappeared, the time track will reset itself the way that it should have been.

Of course, no one really knows what that time-line would look like. Would Haley Joel still have a hot girlfriend?  Would Grandpa get a chance at some action with the nice widow who works in accounting? Big, big questions.

The story is mostly presented by dialogue and is fairly obvious and slow going.  The ending is both nice in a maulding sentimental way and surprising. It's kind of fun to see a grown up Haley Joel. Gillian Anderson and Rufus Sewell really only make token appearances in the movie. It's not a bad watch if you like classic time-travel stories.",1405209600,2,1251,4.7592592592592595
6207457,3,B00HSJ2CVQ,"Rufus Sewell and Gillian Anderson are always amazing, but this movie is more about the loss the wife of the time traveler experiences and her depression that ensues over the long stretch of time that he's gone and not about the sci fi aspects of time travel. If you're looking for a film that captures the moods of those left behind, this could work. If you're looking for true sci fi that transports you, this will leave you fast forwarding until you're at the credit. But long live Rufus and Gillian!",1405209600,3,502,4.527472527472527

I had no idea what to expect from this when I started to watch it. I was interested almost right away but when the time travel thing came up I laughed a little. The more I watched the less absurd it sounded and that actually became the reason I was so sucked in. This is a movie that was actually able to stay one step ahead of the viewer the entire time. Just when you think you know what is going to happen it throws something at you that surprises you right up until the ending that is both shocking and perfect. This is the type of movie that after you watch it all you want to do is tell everyone you know to watch it. That is the beauty of lower budget films. There aren't many blockbuster movies you rave about and think wow my friends need to see this.

Its great accomplishment is that I was able to completely believe in it while watching and felt moved at the end.  But this isn't for everyone - it is genuine hard scifi, not some fast-paced thriller that will awe by special effects alone.
