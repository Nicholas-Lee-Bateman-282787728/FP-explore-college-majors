8200505,4,B000RGIRUC,"This is a primer for HBCU bands. It does not have a lot of the bells and whistles of a performance DVD but it does contain enough to highlight what it's like to be in one of these groups. I'm sure that subsequent dvd's will contain more performance material, barring difficulties with copyright issues. I am a frequent attendee at the HBOB in Atlanta and I've never been disappointed with the live performances. The dvd, although truncated, delivers enough to satisfy even the most ardent ""band-fan"". Kudos to Honda for it's sponsorship.",1198195200,3,537,4.8478260869565215
8200506,1,B000RGIRUC,I thought that the dvd would cpature the whole battle this dvd only gives you i little of each of the ten bands.,1195689600,2,112,3.9130434782608696
8200507,1,B000RGIRUC,"I bought this movie for my son who is a Drumline fanatic and basically taught himself to play drums after watching the movie tens of thousands of times. I thought getting the Honda Battle for him would give him an insight to the ""real"" battle of the bands that go on - not a 'movie' with actors, etc.  Boy was I let down! I thought the Honda Battle dragged on and on (even though the DVD was much shorter than I thought it should be) and there was no real ""umph"" to it.  It was a lot of drug-out boring brass & half-hearted moves. I thought we would see the real stuff that made you want to get up outta your seat! Anyway, my son said he liked it anyway, but I'm still a true Drumline fan.",1183420800,,689,4.021897810218978
8200508,1,B000RGIRUC,"I bought this DVD from the originator web site and I am very dissapointed in this product. My nephew loves marching bands but there are only 12 performances at or around 4 minutes a piece. Not what I expected for an event that sells out the Georgia Dome. If I can save someone else the dissapointment, I'm satisfied. But if you desire to hear people from behind the scenes talk about how they feel and what they think about bands by all means pick this up.",1182902400,4,456,4.313953488372093
