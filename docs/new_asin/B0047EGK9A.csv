4285001,5,B0047EGK9A,I happened upon this show during a LOGO marathon weekend and fell in love.  The characters are hilarious.  I swear I grew up in this town and it felt like I was among family.  When it came to an end I was heartbroken.  When will it return???  I miss LaVonda & Sissy.  I want to stay at their house!!!!  I will pacifiy myself with the movie until the series is released on DVD.  Just hope it happens soon.,1232064000,2,404,4.089743589743589

I can't say enough about the world Del Shores created here, along with the superb cast - especially Beth Grant.

I already had the dvd set released in 2008, and I believed that this set (2012) would give me more episodes of a story that I truly enjoy.  It turned out to be simply a BluRay version of the dvd's.

4285092,5,B0047EGK9A,"What a series to enjoy.  Any one living or raised in the south can relate to this series.  Especially those with heavy church/small town lives.  With Rue McClanahan how could it not be great.  Wish she was still with us.  Plus Leslie Jordan what more can be said a perfect role for him and he does it so believable that you really think that he is a real person not an act !  Bonnie B and Caroline Rhea from tv shows and movies two very good actresses that should have had better careers with their capabilities.  But are perfect fit to the others in this show.  Also the best I have ever seen Olivia Netwon John look period.  Hated all those little girly roles and too much make-up.  This rough Olivia is much better and her songs for this series are great especially the title song Sordid Lives.  If you want to just laugh your butt off with something way different then get Del Shores Sordid Lives have a bottle of wine and enjoy yourself as you will regardless I guarantee it. Oh yes the rest of the cast whom I am not familiar with are a great addition to this show, especially that Juanita, I have know several Juanita's in my life but this one is too funny  Tell us another story Juanita !",1383523200,2,1196,4.266666666666667

It's great seeing the always wonderful Rue McClanahan in one of her last roles too and I am sure she would be happy to know how much laughter she provides her fans in this final performance.

4285142,5,B0047EGK9A,"I just discovered this show on Logo last year(2010). This was one of the funniest shows ever. Leslie Jordan is a riot and has never failed in every show/movie I have ever seen him in. In light of the great comedian Rue McChanahan's unfortunate passing and the way the last episode in the series ended , concerning her character,  the show could still go on today and explain her absence. If my favorite singer, Olivia Newton-John could not come back today, that could be written into a new season as well, since her character was kidnapped at gunpoint, when last we saw. Every character in this show was a barrel of laughs from beginning to end. I regret the second season never came to fruition. Any true romantic at heart wanted to see a positive resolution to Tye's character being set up at the end of season one. An entire new show could be written around the hilarious drunk in the bar and Leslie Jordan's character. They both kept me laughing throughout.

I am a serious comedy fan. Some of my favorites are I Love Lucy, Andy Griffith(With Don Knotts), The Golden Girls. The Jeffersons, Good Times, What's Happening, Wings, Seinfield, Cheers, Happy Days, Laverne And Shirley, Sanford and Son, 227, Whoops, Barney Miller, Benson, All In The Family and Alice. Sordid Lives has to be at the top of the list. Every character was a character and could have spawned a spin-off. That is a rarity. Del Shores has a comedic genius streak. I don't know what he has done since, but I doubt he will, or anyone can, rival this bright spot of life , at a time when television comedies are dying. I would put this show against any in history in their heyday.

4285146,5,B0047EGK9A,"There hasn't been a TV comedy in years that has made me laugh out loud so often as I did watching ""Sordid Lives"".

I bought the VEI Canadian release last year, which was a complete blind-buy for me. I only bought it based on recommendations and because the cast included Rue McClanahan and Olivia Newton-John.

The set is worth getting for the ""Call Waiting"" episode if nothing else. It is a fabulous showcase for the seamless powerhouse performance of Ann Walker thoughout. During the course of the 30-minute installment, she manages to intercept the news of best friend Caroline Rhea's husband's indiscretion with Ann's much-older mother Rue McClanahan while getting her hair done at Roger's beauty salon, The Beehive. It's a Must-See.

The L.A. scenes featuring Jason Dottley as the struggling young gay actor drag the show down a little, and the nudity and sex scenes can be a little gratuitous and unnecessary (""Queer as Folk"" already did all these things back in 2000) and you keep wishing they'd hurry up and get back to all those wacky people in Texas.

Some who bought the Canadian set complained of the full-frame aspect of the discs, but according to the pre-listing, this release WILL BE WIDESCREEN (hurray), but I'll take this show any way I can get it.

Creator Del Shores has said he has already written the entire second season, but LOGO, the U.S. cable station that originally bought and aired the series, hasn't bothered to pay him or any of the actors involved for their work.

Add to that the recent passing of the series' matriarch Rue McClahahan, and sadly, it looks like we may never see what Shores had planned for the wonderfully wacky, tacky people of ""Sordid Lives"" in a second season.

The show is ridiculously sublime. You won't soon shake the image of Sissy, Noleta and Lavonda, all three puffing on cigarettes, dragging a dead goat down the middle of the road, or of zaftig cashier Vera sitting atop her stool at the Corner Stop ringing in cartons of cigarettes for Sissy ($32.09.....$32.09....$32.09); or of Peggy (Rue) having wild sex with her much-younger lover!

The town drunk, Juanita Bartlett, who's obssessed with and convinced that a local radio station's Willie Nelson contest is rigged, (The winning ticket was drawn in 1982!) is also hilarious and steals every scene she's in.

Leslie Jordan as Brother-Boy will break your heart and make you scream with laughter in the same scene as he matches wits with his nasty therapist Dr. Eve, while trying to fulfill his role in preserving the late Tammy Wynette's musical legacy.

Every character is colorful, wonderfully over-the-top and the show is best described as a combination of ""Soap"", ""My Name is Earl"", ""Desperate Housewives"" and ""Mama's Family"".

This series basically serves as a prequel to the ""Sordid Lives"" movie, which is equally good, though I recommend you view the series first.",1287446400,,2882,4.909465020576132

4285151,5,B0047EGK9A,"I won't discuss the merits of the series itself in this review---the premise and description is given on the Amazon web site and in other reviews---other than to say I thought it was hilarious. I loved the cast, the scripts---the whole package. I have no complaints to make about the series at all, other than expressing some regret that it looks like there will never be a series two. Let me focus here on the actual DVDs themselves.

There had been some reports of quality control problems immediately after the set was put on the market, with pixilation and out-of-sync audio issues. I have to say that on my own copy, I've noticed none of that at all (it would appear that there was an isolated bad batch of discs, perhaps?). I'm watching this on a 50-inch widescreen plasma set, and the picture looks fantastic; nicely detailed with no problems in that respect whatsoever.

The set includes three discs. The first two each include six episodes, plus a bonus feature of an extensive slide show featuring stills shot during the filming process. The third disc is all bonus material; it includes the premier's teaser and a number of complete Olivia Newton-John performances. It also includes a fairly comprehensive blooper reel and many, many deleted scenes; a satisfyingly large amount of material for viewing, there.

Some viewers expressed a bit of frustration at the time this aired on television, due to the very frequent commercial interruptions and the ""bleeping"" of some of the dialogue. It's quite a pleasant difference, to watch each episode in one 22-minute uninterrupted go. The DVD release is completely uncensored---and for those interested in such things, contains a bit of nudity not present in the televised version, as well. (Heh.)

Now, there are two drawbacks to this set; one is a bit of a disappointment for me personally, the other could possibly be a problem for a number of viewers. First off, there was a huge amount of promotional/behind the scenes material produced about this series, which appeared on the Logo website as the programme aired on television. I found much of the material fascinating---among other things, it included interviews with many of those involved with the show, and the vlogs creator Del Shores taped for each episode, where he would discuss the particulars of filming with co-star Jason Dottley and (on occasion) some of the other people who appeared in the episode under discussion. I don't know who owns the rights to all this footage, whether it is Del Shores or Logo, but unfortunately not a single bit of it appears in the extras on this set (and none of it is still up on the Logo website). So, that is quite disappointing. I hope it will appear on another DVD release, but have no idea if that is even a possibility.

The second drawback is a technical issue---one I've never encountered before, so I'm hoping for some input from anyone else here who has viewed the DVDs. The picture is framed in the widescreen 1.78:1 ratio, so as to fit perfectly on widescreen/hi-def television sets. (The image should be letterboxed---with black bars at top and bottom---if viewed on a standard tube television.) Now, every single DVD I have that is ""enhanced for widescreen televisions"" has played just fine on my own widescreen set---slide in the DVD, the picture comes on and fills the entire width of the screen, no problem. But in the case of the Sordid Lives DVDs, on all of the episodes the picture is displayed with an anamorphic squeeze---in other words, the widescreen picture is compressed to a 4:3 aspect ratio (the squarish shape of an old television screen), which is centred in the widescreen display. And oddly enough, this is only an issue with the episodes themselves---the slide-shows, and the bonus material on the third disc, have no problems with squeezing/distortion.

Now, this anamorphic squeeze is not really a problem for me, because of course every widescreen set has several pre-set aspect ratio settings---so with the touch of a button on the tv remote, I can adjust the picture so that it displays properly in the correct 1.78:1 shape (and without cropping any part of the frame). However, the point is I shouldn't HAVE to do this. And, this would seem to be a problematic situation for anyone watching the discs on a standard CRT television. I tried playing the discs on a second set-up here (standard TV, standard DVD player), and yes, the anamorphic squeeze was still present---but of course there's no way to compensate for that on a regular television. So, if that viewing method is your only option, you'll be watching a distorted image where all the people appear to have very thin faces and stand about eight feet tall.

Has anyone else had this problem with the discs? I'm most curious to know!

At any rate---absolutely love the series, and although I'm a little disappointed with the lack of some of additional content I was hoping for, I can't complain very much----I'm very pleased with my purchase. I don't know whether the particular playback problem I experienced is widespread, but anyone watching these on a widescreen set should be able to make the necessary adjustments.",1282089600,4,5171,4.881548974943052

I loved the original movie and wanted to see the series; the series is brilliant. With such actors as the talented Leslie Jordan (he was so funny in Ally McBeal and Reba) and actresses such as Rue. I only wish that Delta Burke (replaced by Caroline Rhea) had a regular part in the series. As noted previously, it is a shame that Season 2 was never produced.

4285160,5,B0047EGK9A,"I went to see ""Sordid Lives"" the movie several years ago with a friend and loved it!  It was truy one of the funniest movies we had ever seen as we laughed all the way through it from the second the movie started when Olivia Newton-John started singing the theme song...""ain't it a bitch sorting out our Sordid Lives, it's a bitch...""  When the movie came out on DVD, we went out and bought it the day of its release.  Then several years later, we were so excited when the LOGO channel premired ""Sordid Lives: The Series.""  This series has most all of the same cast members as in the movie with the exception of a few...the Delta Burke character is replaced by Caroline Rhea who is perhaps even better in the series than Delta Burke was in the movie if you can imagine that because Delta was wonderful but I have to admit that Caroline Rhea's performace in the series is out of this world.  She truly nailed the part!  Jason Dottley plays the role of Ty...you can't get any better than that.  Then there's the legendary ""Golden Girl"" (Blanche) Rue McClanahan who plays the family matriarch, Peggy.  Rue McClanahan plays a role unlike any other she's ever played.  You truly won't believe it!!  She is amazing and so very funny in this role...I had to stop and think that the person playing this role was actually the actress that played Blanche on the Golden Girls....WONDERFUL.  Leslie Jordan plays the hilarious Brother Boy who is obsessed with dressing up in drag and perfoming as Tammy Wynette.  Bonnie Bedelia, Ann Walker, Rosemary Alexander, Sarah Hunley, Beth Grant, and Olivia Newton-John make up the rest of this amazing cast.  Beth Grant is perhaps one of the best and funniest of all the cast!  Then again, there's nothing negative to say about any of these cast members or the series.  I was so glad when the series was released on DVD.  When I got my copy, I watched all 12 episodes without stopping.  I have never laughed so much at any other movie or series EVER!  My only complaint is that this series has not returned for a second season.  Hopefully there will be a second season in the future or even another movie as there are so many more stories to be told.  As for now, we have ""Sordid Lives"" the movie and ""Sordid Lives: The Series"" to enjoy over and over.  Please take my advice and buy both the movie and the series.  You won't be sorry...you'll only be laughing and you truly won't be able to get enough!!",1264291200,19,2431,4.489749430523918
4285161,5,B0047EGK9A,"I'm sure if you're reading this, you're looking to buy this still in-limbo series and already are familiar with the episodes.  You're probably also worried about the pressings having problems like bad audio sync or compression artifacts.

Let me ease everyone's minds and say the set doesn't have any of those problems.  Everything is spot-on and looks much better than the compressed version fed via cable.  I've been through all the extras and there are no hiccups in playback.

That said, there's not much about extras included in the details section for the set.  The first 2 discs are the 12 Episodes plus photos.  The episodes are uncensored both in audio and video, so you hear a lot more and see just a little bit more.  Definitely starting with Episode 3, the show started reaching beyond standard cable shows for content, especially with the infamous ""Call Waiting"" episode.  You get to hear beyond ""Beep, Beep, Beep"" and it much more enjoyable.

The third disc includes the series teaser trailer, bloopers, deleted scenes and music done by Olivia Newton-John.  The bloopers really are extensive and very funny.  I had a blast watching them especially when one of the cast members would get the giggles and just had to get through it.  The trailer is something you could already see on the internet or could have seen prior to the series making it onto TV.  Olivia's music is great and a nice addition.  I found the deleted scenes, while extensive, were mostly deleted for a reason.  There were a few gems inside there, but most were extensions of already-existing scenes or additional before/after content that didn't add too much to the story.  I'm sure that's why they were deleted.  It was nice to have that as well although more bloopers would have been nice.

All in all, this is the best available way to watch the series.  The DVD doesn't have the issues that plagued the very first pressings and is a must-own if you are a fan of the series.  Now, to somehow get a season 2...",1262304000,69,1995,4.708092485549133
4285162,5,B0047EGK9A,"This is a great show. I'm looking forward to buy the first season, I love all the episodes. People at Del Shores did an amazing job.",1258243200,,132,4.115384615384615
4285163,5,B0047EGK9A,"I heard quite by chance that the Sordid Lives series was now available on DVD---and the moment I did, I ordered it at once.  However, it should be noted that this is a Canadian release; unfortunately it's still not officially available in the US.  There has been some sort of legal wrangling going on with the party that owns the rights to US distribution;  I don't know all the details, but it doesn't look like a US release is anywhere in sight as of this date (November 2009).  No fear, however---Canada to the rescue!  The series DVDs are listed on the Canadian Amazon site, and since the US and Canadian DVD systems are identical, Canadian DVDs will play fine on American televisions.  The only drawback in ordering anything from Amazon in Canada and having it sent to the US is the higher shipping rate---which in my case was about $9.55 USD.  But, no big deal...

I won't discuss the merits of the series itself in this review---the premise and description is given on the Canadian Amazon web site---other than to say I thought it was hilarious. I loved the cast, the scripts---the whole package. I have no complaints to make about the series at all, other than expressing some regret that it looks like there will never be a series two. Let me focus here on the actual DVDs themselves.

There had been some reports of quality control problems immediately after the set was put on the market, with pixilation and out-of-sync audio issues. I have to say that on my own copy, I've noticed none of that at all (it would appear that there was an isolated bad batch of discs, perhaps?). I'm watching this on a 50-inch widescreen plasma set, and the picture looks fantastic; nicely detailed with no problems in that respect whatsoever.

The set includes three discs. The first two each include six episodes, plus a bonus feature of an extensive slide show featuring stills shot during the filming process. The third disc is all bonus material; it includes the premier's teaser and a number of complete Olivia Newton-John performances. It also includes a fairly comprehensive blooper reel and many, many deleted scenes; a satisfyingly large amount of material for viewing, there.

Some viewers expressed a bit of frustration at the time this aired on television, due to the very frequent commercial interruptions and the ""bleeping"" of some of the dialogue. It's quite a pleasant difference, to watch each episode in one 22-minute uninterrupted go. The DVD release is completely uncensored---and for those interested in such things, contains a bit of nudity not present in the televised version, as well. (Heh.)

Now, there are two drawbacks to this set; one is a bit of a disappointment for me personally, the other could possibly be a problem for a number of viewers. First off, there was a huge amount of promotional/behind the scenes material produced about this series, which appeared on the Logo website as the programme aired on television. I found much of the material fascinating---among other things, it included interviews with many of those involved with the show, and the vlogs creator Del Shores taped for each episode, where he would discuss the particulars of filming with co-star Jason Dottley and (on occasion) some of the other people who appeared in the episode under discussion. I don't know who owns the rights to all this footage, whether it is Del Shores or Logo, but unfortunately not a single bit of it appears in the extras on this set (and none of it is still up on the Logo website). So, that is quite disappointing. I hope it will appear on the American DVD release, but have no idea if that is even a possibility---and who knows how long it will be until the American release, anyway?

The second drawback is a technical issue---one I've never encountered before, so I'm hoping for some input from anyone else here who has viewed the DVDs. The picture is framed in the widescreen 1.78:1 ratio, so as to fit perfectly on widescreen/hi-def television sets. (The image should be letterboxed---with black bars at top and bottom---if viewed on a standard tube television.) Now, every single DVD I have that is ""enhanced for widescreen televisions"" has played just fine on my own widescreen set---slide in the DVD, the picture comes on and fills the entire width of the screen, no problem. But in the case of the Sordid Lives DVDs, on all of the episodes the picture is displayed with an anamorphic squeeze---in other words, the widescreen picture is compressed to a 4:3 aspect ratio (the squarish shape of an old television screen), which is centred in the widescreen display. And oddly enough, this is only an issue with the episodes themselves---the slide-shows, and the bonus material on the third disc, have no problems with squeezing/distortion.

Now, this anamorphic squeeze is not really a problem for me, because of course every widescreen set has several pre-set aspect ratio settings---so with the touch of a button on the tv remote, I can adjust the picture so that it displays properly in the correct 1.78:1 shape (and without cropping any part of the frame). However, the point is I shouldn't HAVE to do this. And, this would seem to be a problematic situation for anyone watching the discs on a standard CRT television.

He wrote the second season scripts (creating a role especially for Whoopie), but recently Shores announced the second season will not be shot or air.  Apparently there are disagreements about royalties being paid (or not paid), and some of the network stakeholders have hesitated to order the 2nd season despite great viewer numbers and high critical acclaim in both gay and mainstream media.

4285170,5,B0047EGK9A,"While I enjoyed ""Sordid Lives"" the movie, there were times when it took uneven dark turns that didn't flow together smoothly from scene to scene and forced me to leave my comfort zone for pure enjoyment. Del Shores has lightened up ""Sordid Lives"" the TV series, and in turn, I think actually makes his point better about about dyfunctional Southerners and family members.
Two key cast member changes helped contribute a lot to Del's new concept. First, don't ever let it be said I'm not a long time Delta Burke fan. However, casting Caroline Rae in Delta's part as Noleta was a stroke of brillance. Secondly, contrary to some opinion, I think Jason Dottley- Del Shores' real life husband- playing Ty was a big bonus move also. I always thought Kirk Geiger (movie Ty) looked too old for the part, not that great an actor, and never convinced me he was the ""confused"" Ty that he was trying to convey in the movie. Jason adds a dimension to Ty that is more vulnerable, scared, sweet, confused, and searching for what he what he wants and who he is on a much more satisfying level to me. Bravo Jason! And THANK YOU Beth, Bonnie, Olivia, Rosemary, and Leslie for coming back to do the series! A very special thank you goes to Rue McClanhan for joining the cast this season.
Yes, I became obsesesed with the show week after week. You come to love all the characters- even the ones you ""hate."" The dialogue is crisp, funny, intelligent, irrelevant, and why we all sit down to watch a TV series so we can escape the escapades and drama of our own sordid lives. Each episode became a ""water cooler"" conversation with my friends with every new episode.
TOO many memorable lines to recite: ""Bam! Bam! Bam!"" ""What'd I miss?"" ""And pussy is spelled with two 'S''s!"" ""... but I've never lost consciousness before noon."" ""We've got to mow that airstrip."" ""It must have been exciting to live during the birth of cinema."" ""I didn't know it was going to be that big!"" ""That'll be $32.09, that'll be $32.09...."" ""Three words I never get tired of hearing."" ""Quit zigzagging!"" AND I can't forget Olivia's ""Richard"" song!
