7998683,3,B0000CBXZV,"I bought this for my six year old grandson, who was fascinated by snakes this summer.  Perhaps because by the time it came he had already watched a number of programs about snakes, he wasn't so thrilled with this one.  I thought it was pretty good - he wanted more gore.",1377216000,,270,4.2745098039215685
7998684,3,B0000CBXZV,"Very good films about turtles and crocs.  Only available on DVD, dated but if you are a die hard fan of these critters, you will enjoy it.  Kind of a disturbing bit about a turtle that romps around the grounds of his keeper with a sign drilled onto its shell, isn't that kind of gross?",1336694400,3,285,4.163636363636364

7998686,4,B0000CBXZV,"An excellent edition in a great series of documentaries from PBS. It made me cringe a lot and glad I live in the Midwest, thousands of miles from the nearest of these reptiles. Very entertaining as well as informative. I highly recommend the entire Nature series.",1156032000,6,263,4.739130434782608
