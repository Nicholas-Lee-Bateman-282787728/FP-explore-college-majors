1697400,4,B0000640VB,"If you're looking at this, I'll assume you know there's the first season too :)
This box-set picks up where the first season finished, or rather, it doesn't. The first few episodes (featuring martial arts pair figure-skating of all things), looked to me like the belonged in the first season (heck, there's even a reference to it in second-to-last episode of the first season).
Still, it's all very enjoyable.
This box-set is practically identical to the first season's, same packaging (different color/pictures, but still), same extras (text-less opening/ending etc..).
It's even consistent in the transfer quality, which is still very good (the original masters were used) and still has the hard-subtitled text overlays and even the same shimmers on the english logo.
Wow, talk about consistency. Really, these flaws (if I can even call them that) do not detract one yota from the sheer enjoyability of the Ranma series.
The 2nd season is just as good as the first (in my opinion) and I eagerly await the third coming (err, I mean the coming of the third of course :)",1020211200,,1069,4.944444444444445
1697401,5,B0000640VB,"*stroke boxset* Precious... precious. This collection is deffinatly worth getting. I am not a material person, but it is now my prized possession. The humour, and twistings story lines collaborating with the underlining love story makes this the best anime comedy series that i have seen.  I hate romantic comedies, but the story of Ranma is unlike any other. Season 2 is just as full of fun as the first season, just with more plot twists and colorful characters introduced.  Rumiko Takahashi, will you marry me? *kidnaps*
 bahaha!
Buy this.... now.",1019260800,,550,5.021978021978022
1697402,5,B0000640VB,"Ranma 1/2 never looked better.  The transition to DVD is now at its fullest.  The original video masters from KITTY TV were used, ensuring the highest animation quality possible.  However it is not perfect.  There is some level of graininess, and line inconsistency, also their is some color bleeding, especially in the intro.
But, the consistency of the animation, far makes up for this.  Unlike the first boxed set, the animation is high quality on every single episode.  The outlining is crisp and the colors are vivid and distinct.  I've never seen Ranma 1/2 look so good.
This is a must buy for all Ranma 1/2 fans.  The pacing of the story has quickened in the second season.  Takahashi's characters are now fully developed.  And my look how they shine!  You'll love it.  And you'll be begging to see the next season.",1018569600,12,822,4.711267605633803

1697404,5,B0000640VB,"If you thought Season One of Ranma 1/2 introduced you to some strange but loveable characters, you, to quote the vernacular, ""ain't seen nothin' yet.""
From a skating competition to rescue Akane's pet P-chan (Ranma's rival Ryoga in a cursed form), to the return of Amazon warrior Shampoo, now fully aware of Ranma's curse, and carrying one of her own, things get weirder and weirder.
We also get to meet the man who founded the Anything Goes School of Martial Arts, the pint-sized pervert Happosai. He'll go after anything female, even girl-type Ranma.
And Shampoo is accompanied by her Great-Grandmother, a skilled warrior who knows techniques that can make Ranma a more powerful martial artist, or leave him broken in the hands of his rival, Ryoga.
And tremble in fear as tomboy extrodinaire Akane Tendo prepares a meal. (and thank whatever diety you believe in that you don't have to eat it.)
Ranma 1/2 is a strong series all the way through. If you like Season One, then you know that this transgender martial arts comedy is the most hilarious thing on the market.

1697437,5,B0000640VB,"This is my favorite season so far of the Ranma  series. I've only seen the first, second, third, and fourth, though, so there is a chance for that to change. The second season has a little more emphasis on the relationships between the characters than the first season which makes it somewhat more appealing. Also, as you get further along in the series, the plots in each episode become more and more complex. The second season is well worth the price! I just can't wait for the rest of the other seasons to come out so I can buy those, too.",1036368000,,542,4.366336633663367

1697441,5,B0000640VB,"I won't bother going in to how wonderfuly hilarious the Ranma series is, and this season will not disappoint.  The only real gripe I have is with the way they treated the opening and closing.  For starters, they decided to ditch the Japanese title screen (which says Ranma 1/2 and under it in kanji is a phrase that translates to anything goes martial arts) in exchange for their own really REALLY ugly english one.  Thankfully in the last disc where they have the clean opening and endings, they kept the original logo.  Secondly, they did not give romaji lyrics to the opening and ending themes, something that while not major, is a nice feature that appears on almost every anime releases(1st episode is translated english, 2nd is romaji, 3rd none and repeat).  They also ditched the title screen for each episode which had the Japanese for the episode written out as Akane reads it, and instead they put in their own title screen with the english translation of the title.  But not everything is bad however, this time around they used soft subtitles for the signs and what not, vs. season 1 where the subtitles were hard.  This is a feature that is much appreciated.  All in all however, this minor gripes should not prevent you from enjoying 22 more episodes of the hilarious antics of Ranma 1/2!",1026691200,,1302,4.6798245614035086
1697442,5,B0000640VB,"Ranma 1/2 is a series that all anime fans should see, so why not pick up the 2nd season with the most convienient method?
This 2nd season is known as Ranma 1/2 Nettouhen in Japan.  You see, the first season didn't do so well in the ratings, so they re-worked the story a bit to add more gags and the characters were also touched up a bit.  The result was one of the most popular series of all time.
The story has alot of naughty humor, but the original manga (comic book) was written by a woman, Rumiko Takahashi, so there is a wonderful sensivity present in the story line.
Other than getting a great series in bulk, this DVD isn't so hot.  The audio should have been remastered.  It comes out almost as mono on my DVD player.  Special features are mostly absent.  But, it's still better than getting the series on VHS.
Must buy for anime fans and Rumiko Takahashi fans.",1023840000,2,871,4.3128834355828225
1697443,5,B0000640VB,"But it is nevertheless very, very good.  It doesn't have the continued-story soap opera like quality that the first season had, nor does it follow the manga continuity with such slavishness.  Which is a shame, because I like that:)The wacky humor hasn't changed, Ranma is still changing genders at the drop of a hat, Akane still can't cook, and Ryoga (as P-Chan) has taken up semi-permenent residence at the Tendo dojo. New characters include Mousse (Shampoo's ex-fiancee) and Cologne (Shampoo's grandmother).  And there is Happosai, trainer of Genma and Soun and easily the most lecherous character in all of anime. We are also introduced to a continuing theme/plot device: Ranma's pathological aversion to cats.  So much so that he will turn into a cat to get away from them. The extras on this are nothing to wite home about.  Some creditless opening and closing themes and a few other goodies.  But it's the stories that count after all.  Definitely worth a buy.",1023580800,4,966,4.925925925925926
1697444,5,B0000640VB,"Yes. This second season brings more: more dvds, more chapters, more fun, more answers!!!. Here new characters are brought in and the quality of the drawings gots better. The martial arts stuff also gets improved, showing one the invincible techniques of Ranma!. This one cames without censure (just like the first season) and is packed with more adventures and sets of several chapters that complete a full story. I warn you, if you start watching one, you will end up finishing one or two complete dvds. Same as the first season, comes in english and japanese with subtitles (japanese in mono).

7960070,4,B0000640VB,"Who ever thought that every day things like plays, fast food delivery and even taking a bath could result in so much confusion and fun?

I mean, come on... I find plays dull, although I do realize that I'm in the minority there. Look at the number of High school kids who love drama, who love to flex their developing acting muscles?

And what about Fast food? I used to order pizza all the time, but after my health took a turn for the worse, I had to cut it out. Heh, remember some places, the motto... thirty minutes or it's free?

Well, there is the third one, taking a bath - I'm a shower man myself, and that happens after I get up in the morning. Just to help me wake up.

How about Sports? Take downhill skiing and figure skating... I don't care for either, but man, I have to tell you that if it was portrayed like it is in this season, I'd have to re-consider my views on these.

But these every day occurrences take on a whole new meaning in the second season of Ranma .

The nice thing is that there are twenty two episodes available for viewing, instead of the 18 that were on the first season.

Even though there really wasn't a season long story arc for this season, there were several significant events that ended up becoming a common theme.

First and foremost was the introduction of Shampoo's great-great grandmother Colonge, the leader of the Chinese Amazons. As a side note, I still get a major kick out of the whole concept, a group of Chinese Amazons... considering the Amazon rainforest isn't even on the same continent!

I digress...

Now, this ancient Ghoul (according to Ranma) is determined to see him marry her great-great Grand-daughter, Shampoo (what's with the bizarre names anyhow?). This storyline runs over the course of several episodes, and it introduces the other major arc to the second season.

That is the fact that Ranma, his father, Ryoga, and another character who's introduced this season, will be able to free themselves of their unique curses. This particular storyline lasts until the end of the second season.

The chaos that attracted me to the series remains unchanged in the second season. There are numerous times throughout each and every episode that I laugh quite hard. The fact that every single kind of sports (and non sports) becomes a battleground makes it all that much more entertaining.

After all, I did mention fast food delivery, and even a play (Romeo and Juliet) end up becoming a major competition. And who'd have thought that a bathhouse could end up being totally destroyed in the process of trying to get clean?

There are small changes in the characters in this season, although some remain unaffected, like Kuno and his insane sister (which, much to my amazement is voiced by none other than Teryl Rothery, probably best known for her role as Dr. Janet Fraiser on Stargate SG1).

Now, because I enjoyed the season as much as I did, I would have given it a five out of five. However, there was the introduction of yet another character that I found very inappropriate and downright disgusting.

The master of Genma and Soun Tendo. A ancient little pervert named Happosai. I don't know, maybe I'm just getting old, but for me that is just wrong. I found him to be more than a little disturbing.

Mainly because of his habit of going around and burying his face in what appears to be underage girls, and stealing their underwear.

The series was just fine without this character.

Still, it wasn't enough for me to want to stop watching it, and I will be getting into to the 3rd season very soon.

4 out of 5.",1201564800,,3581,4.565625
7960071,5,B0000640VB,"So let's pick up where we left off. Ranma is a guy that turns into a girl whenever he gets wet and when he's doused with hot water he becomes a guy again. He is engaged to Akane a girl who hates him just as much as he hates her. Ryoga, his old school rival has tracked him down to kill him, but turns into Akane's pet piglet P-Chan when he gets wet. The Amazon princess Shampoo is in love with the boy Ranma, but wants to kill the girl Ranma. Tatewake Kuno (The school hot shot) has a mad crush on Akane and the girl Ranma, but wants to kill the boy Ranma because he's engaged to Akane and at the same time his kid sister Kodaji is sickly in love with the boy Ranma....whoa  when does the madness stop???!!!

The second season of `Ranma ' keeps the story moving along in all its wacky glory. It's a season of hysterical competitions, wacky races for glory and searches for cures of the cursed springs that for some reason is turning all these characters into something else. Now the engagement of Ranma and Akane is really taking a toll as we are introduced to the 3000 year old queen of the Amazons who wants to make sure that her great granddaughter gets the man she must marry and believe me it will take a lot of patience and quick wit for Ranma to match up to this tough cookie. It sure doesn't end here as Shampoo's stalker the Kuno kids faithfull servant and yes even Ranma's dad's old master find his way into Ranma's world, panty raids `n all. At this rate there will be no peace for a while at the Tendo house.

Sit back and get ready for a monumental season as Ranma is put to the test to find his inner strength and maybe even find the courage to show Akane his true feelings for her.

Not only is that great that you get every single episode from the Anything Goes Martial Arts series but now you don't have to worry about funding some of the hard to find DVD's (FOUL PLAY, CHESTNUTS ROASTING ON AN OPEN FIRE and the BREAKING POINT).
This series carries on the on-going saga that it Ranma 1/2/ Of course Ranma and Akane return and so do the Eternal Lost Boy Ryoga, Shampoo, the Tendo family, Upperclassman Kuno and his sister the Kodachi but also in this one are some introductions to the some new characters, new adventures and all out fun!
This set is seriously a great buy for any Ranma 1/2 fan. You really could not ask for more (aside from Season 3 and 4 on DVD!). If you haven't gotten into Ranma yet, I'd suggest going back to the first season because otherwise you're not going to get it and I've noticed that some people have a hard time following it if they're not up to speed, so really if you haven't seen the first Ranma 1/2 season, do it that FIRST!
I realize that of course the boxed set is quite a bit of cash but it is worth it. I can tell you this right now, it's worse if you try to find each DVD one by one and pay for them full price. You'll be spending vouble from what you should have paid for if you just buy the boxed set (trust me I know! I bought the entire 1st season one by one and realized that it was a better deal to buy the boxed set afterwards). That and if you buy the boxed set, you won't have to go store to store looking for those rare ones! Again, get this boxed set if you're a serious Ranma 1/2 collector and fan!",1037750400,2,1629,4.109717868338558
