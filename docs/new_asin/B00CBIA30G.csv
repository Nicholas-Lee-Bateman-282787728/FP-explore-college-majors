8579835,3,B00CBIA30G,"Huge RiRI fan but this is kinda boring considering how controversial the tour itself was. Kinda glosses over the horror the passengers of the 777 experienced. The performances are poorly filmed too, unprofessional camerawork",1490918400,,224,5.617647058823529
8579836,2,B00CBIA30G,To much documentary not enough music,1479340800,,36,5.166666666666667

8579838,1,B00CBIA30G,"I know, finding a G rated documentary on Rihanna is like asking a copperhead not to be poisonous... but I was buying this as a gift for a young teenager... So when I saw it had a G rating on Amazon, I'm not stupid, I knew it was probably not G rated, but figured it meant it was for watching without Advisory... When the documentary came, it says ""Parental Advisory Explicit Content"" which means I cannot give it as a gift... so return it, I must. Just wanted to let others know in case they were in the same situation I am in, to save someone else the hassle of returning this.",1397692800,,578,4.169642857142857
8579839,3,B00CBIA30G,It wasn't as personal or entertaining as the Beyonce DVD but it was somewhat enjoyable. I drifted off a few times and did things around the house while it played.,1394064000,,162,4.433333333333334

8579842,3,B00CBIA30G,"I feel as though they did not include enough of the on stage performances. Most of the content was a lot of behind the scenes footage of the crew doing silly things like streaking and talking a lot of nonsense, and Rihanna did not feature enough",1381449600,,245,4.3478260869565215
8579843,3,B00CBIA30G,"I'm a huge Rihanna fan so when I heard this was coming out I was very excited about it! But in the end I think they could have done better and given more of a behind the scenes look at the 777 tour because watching it, it just felt like it was hastily put together just to get another Rihanna DVD on the market!",1377302400,,311,3.875
