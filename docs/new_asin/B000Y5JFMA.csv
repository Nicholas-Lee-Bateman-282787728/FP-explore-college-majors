8231126,2,B000Y5JFMA,"Somewhat of a disappointment.  Lacks closed captioning which is important to me due to high frequency hearing loss.  It stutters and freezes on the computer which I somewhat expected and is tolerable, but it is not acceptable to have the same thing, albeit to a lesser extent, on a Samsung Blu ray player.  If you really like the SG series then it's a tolerable alternative to not being able to watch it, but the quality and features could definitely be improved.  Its sad to see this this entertaining show treated so disrespectfully.",1519689600,,535,4.782608695652174

8231128,3,B000Y5JFMA,"the stargate series are great entertainment if you like space sitcom with a touch of ""Indiana Jones themes"" the only hang up is that amazon charges you per season to stream, there should be an option to purchase all seasons at once!",1517702400,,232,4.5476190476190474
