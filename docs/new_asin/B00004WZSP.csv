7925768,3,B00004WZSP,"I am on a quest for the perfect, hard core cardio kickboxing workout, and the closest I have seen so far is XKO Kickboxing by Larry Lam (tho I wish it had more kicks in it). I bought Eversley Forte's tape based on the 2 awesome reviews on Amazon, and I was just a tad disappointed since I was looking for an ""intermediate to advanced"" workout, but this one aired on the intermediate side. The instruction on this tape is superb, both at the beginning and during the workout - Eversley takes the time to remind you what you should be focusing on and what *not* to do throughout the video. I would even recommend this tape to beginners since one of the people in the video does a low impact version of all the moves... As with all exercise, you can/should also modify and work at your own pace. My next challenge will be Dawei: I hear that tape is a *real* killer!",1005609600,2,862,4.262195121951219
7925769,5,B00004WZSP,"What a great follow-up to the first Cardio Athletic Kickbox! That tape  showed off Forte's strengths as a fun, engaging instructor in his own right  without needing to be in Billy Blank's shadow. It was a good,  medium-intensity workout, a bit short, very simple. This sequel offers a  workout one step up--longer, a bit more variety in combos and more  intensity, with the same engaging charm. Forte is down-to-earth and  cheerful, establishes a camaraderie with his exercisers, while leading them  through interesting new combos like jab jab hook hook front-kick,  roundhouse kick. You also do lots of roundhouse-side kick combos, which  really helps differentiate between the two kicks. A unique sequence  involves an elbow strike-down and squat--a welcome departure from the jabs,  hooks and uppercuts. The music is much better than in the first video, too.  Sometimes a beat will coordinate perfectly with a punch-kick sequence. That  always helps mentally!  A good solid workout with a professional, engaging  instructor who really seems to be enjoying himself, and his spirit is  infectious!",968976000,10,1098,5.333333333333333
