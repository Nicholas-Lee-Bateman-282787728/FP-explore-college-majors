8332305,5,B001P72A0A,It's an entertaining dvd to watch. The stories are almost soothing to sit down and listen to. My nephew really likes it( he's had the book for a while now) !,1386460800,,157,4.096774193548387
8332306,5,B001P72A0A,"This has numerous stories on it:  3 are Jane Yolen's, the others by other authors.  You can also watch at least two of them in Spanish.  My just recently turned 2 year old grandson wants to watch over and over.  After the first 4 stories, there are 3 bonus ones.  One teaches about dinosaur skeletons.  Probably some of that is lost on him, but he will understand better when he is older.  The story about Stanley and the Dinosaurs is claymation (I think), not cartoon.  It might scare younger kids a bit, and was tedious to sit through, but it has lessons to teach that may be obvious to older children.  While the dinosaurs roar a lot, they don't hurt anyone.  For the child who loves dinosaurs, this is a treat.  If you are not familiar with the Jane Yolen books, they feature dinosaurs behaving badly for their human parents, followed by how they should behave when sick, going to bed, eating, etc.  The dinosaur is really a child at the end.  Each dinosaur shown has its species name in an inconspicuous place on the page, but it's more obvious in the books that the video.  The dinosaurs are colorful, but realistically shaped.",1386460800,2,1133,4.517241379310345
8332307,5,B001P72A0A,"I teach kindergarten and have several of the Scholastic DVDs. I use them in correlation with the story books and I also use them for short breaks, rainy day recesses, etc. The kids LOVE them and the best part is that you can turn on the Read Along feature and the words play across the screen. The kids love pointing out words they know.",1381795200,,337,4.28125
8332308,5,B001P72A0A,This video is absolutely adorable. My kid is crazy for dinosaurs right now and he loves to act out all of the antics of the dinosaur/children.,1372550400,,142,4.5
8332309,5,B001P72A0A,My 2 year old grandsons are wild about dinosaurs and this series of books is their and my favorite. The video makes a fun companion to the books. Definitely get them together.,1354665600,,175,4.5
8332310,5,B001P72A0A,This book was a major hit with my 18 month old grandson who is CRAZY about dinosaurs.  The board book is true to the story presented in the original version and clearly shows the dinosaurs in some strange but funny situations.  Worth every penny!!!,1340064000,3,248,4.613636363636363
