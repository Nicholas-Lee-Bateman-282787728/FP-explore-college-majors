4834149,2,B005M5FBPW,"This might work while doing house work, with a type of moving wall paper on the flat screen tv.  A quick look at it found the shots were average one or two were excellent.  Eg the first shot is the camera left on the tripod and you watch boats for five minutes.  The camera does not pan or zoom.  And the view is frankly average.  This looks like it was just done on the cheap with little real effort put into it.  The sound track is good, turn that up for the birds and other local noises.  It only goes for an hour and there are no extras.",1388620800,,541,3.9537037037037037
4834150,1,B005M5FBPW,"Not Good! Not only does the BluRay not work, but it spends about 2-3 minutes on each scene then moves on - and at the end comes an intrusive advertisement to sell the DVD. It's pathetic and completely unnecessary -  and I plan to return it immediately. I've bought many scenic DVDs and this is not one I would either keep or recommend to anyone. Save your money - and buy the ones professionally made by Earthscapes or AMOS. Very disappointed.",1384646400,,443,4.469135802469136
4834151,5,B005M5FBPW,We run this on a Samsung 7000 series at 240 Hz.  We use the BD setting and Natural setting.  Great video.  The TV struggles to render some water surfaces such as Trunk Bay of Dt. John...but overall it is fantastic.  I have bough 10 such discs and this is one of the most worthwhile.  The camera is fixed and there is no panning or zooming.  The sound recording of the sounds is excellent.  Enjoy!,1376265600,4,396,4.27027027027027
4834152,4,B005M5FBPW,"This is a beautiful blu ray and definitely worth the price (I got it for $5 on amazon with free shipping), however it's not quite as wonderful as the Hawaii waves blu ray that has constant ocean waves views and sounds. This one will go down by the water and then up onto the cliffs looking down into a cove, so again, gorgeous, but not the consistent waves-on-the-beach as others in this series. I recommend it as long as you know what you're getting.",1375747200,3,451,4.380952380952381

Absolutely amazing HD pictures of some of the most beautiful beaches in the world.  My only complaint is that the scenes are too short.  Just when you begin to relax watching one, it switches to another.  It would be great if you could choose individual scenes and order 2 hours of it.  There are some stunning shots that I know had to end up on the cutting room floor.  I'd like to see Picture Perfect HD Caribbean with 2 hours of one scene...to feel like you're really there.  Great photography!",1360886400,12,689,5.969387755102041
4834154,4,B005M5FBPW,"This Blu ray offers gorgeous views from various locations in the Caribbean. You can choose natural sounds where you can hear the birds singing and bees buzzing or you can add a beautiful sound track to the natural sounds.  Very soothing and calming.  I play it while doing Yoga and a weight routine and during meditation.  Good quality HD and shows in full screen on my 55"" HDTV.  The camera in each scene in focused on one spot, no panning.",1357948800,7,441,4.475
4834155,5,B005M5FBPW,"This was exactly what I was looking for.  This is not a travel show. This does not have a story.  This is not educational (except briefly displaying where the scene was taken).  Its not exciting, nor is it designed to be ""watched"", which seems to be the chief complaint from folks who don't understand the goal of the series.

This BR DVD is one of a series from the Windows Channel, which puts an HD camera somewhere awesome in the world and turns it on and just lets it run.  Many high-end hotels have it running on their in-house cable channels.  Its exactly as described; a brief window into another world, just as though you were sitting on a bench watching it, or have the greatest view from your window.  It instantly transports you to another world.  Its great for background content when entertaining.  The sound is good, but I usually just mute it and turn on my own music playlists.

Again, if you are looking for something to ""watch"", this isn't for you. If you want high quality blue-ray living content of awesome paradise locations to display as background entertainment, I highly recommend this series.",1337212800,15,1117,4.653061224489796
4834156,2,B005M5FBPW,"I bought this for rainy days on the treadmill. It looks like someone just put up a camera and filmed the same thing. The camera never moves. It,s boaring. The music is more inline with elevator music. If your going to make a dvd on the caribbean at least use island music. Save your money and if you have to have it buy it used.",1334534400,2,328,4.061538461538461
4834157,5,B005M5FBPW,Awesome br this is great just to listen to Mother Nature and relax if you need to meditate or just to day dream about going to the places on the br. I've used it while on the treadmill from start to finish and you don't really notice the time gone by until it's done!,1443830400,,267,3.962962962962963
4834158,3,B005M5FBPW,Great picture. Wish it go with documentary. Music only.,1442102400,,55,5.222222222222222
4834159,1,B005M5FBPW,"Did not like this - although cheap, it was a waste of money.  Will throw this BR out.  It consists of about 10 different settings where someone set a camera and took time lapsed photography.  Absolutely no narriative at all.  Just lapping waters.",1437609600,2,246,4.651162790697675
4834160,5,B005M5FBPW,"For those who have traveled to the Caribbean, this is a must view because one always misses something interesting.",1437350400,2,114,5.052631578947368
4834161,5,B005M5FBPW,Enjoyed the dvd. Just like being there,1434844800,,38,4.571428571428571

4834163,1,B005M5FBPW,I received 1 Blu ray disc with 16 scenes. This is a screen saver. There is no commentary or anything else.,1430611200,,106,4.095238095238095
4834164,3,B005M5FBPW,OK,1418515200,,2,2.0
4834165,1,B005M5FBPW,Wife ordered blu-ray disk. Don't have a blu-ray player! So this item is completely useless to me.  More money wasted.,1403740800,,117,4.85
4834166,5,B005M5FBPW,"Nice to have the option of music or none and just enjoy and the natural sound of waves and birds etc.
The music as a whole was outstanding and appropriate, although a couple melodies seemed a little melancholy.
A few scenes were not all that exceptional in beauty, but as a whole very nice and well worthwhile.",1395187200,4,310,4.456140350877193
8479161,5,B005M5FBPW,I relax with this DVD/Blu-ray after long days of work. It takes me to a place of tranquility and peace! The choice of music or just the natural sound of the ocean or nature was appealing to me. I recommend this Picture Perfect DVD to anyone who needs to take a moment (all of us working folk do!) to be still and be at peace!,1517961600,,325,4.015384615384615
8479162,5,B005M5FBPW,So nice to have this on your tv in the background.  Very relaxing.,1510617600,,66,4.076923076923077
8479163,1,B005M5FBPW,Complete waste of money and time viewing the DVD. Many of the 'Spectacular Sights and Sounds of the Tropics' are just the same location at a different time of the day. I use the DVD case as a coaster for tropical drinks.,1459209600,,220,4.261904761904762
8479164,3,B005M5FBPW,"so so, no description of where the hell the shots we take at?",1457913600,,61,3.769230769230769
8479165,1,B005M5FBPW,Terrible-no narration.,1456790400,,22,10.5
8479166,4,B005M5FBPW,"If you're a fan of the Sunrise Earth series and you're looking for something similar, just more ""beachy"", this Blu-Ray should satisfy you. Picture quality is good. Natural sounds are good. You can toggle music on or off. Only cons...wish it was a little longer and that they'd shot in a few more locations (scenes are from St. John's, Aruba and The Bahamas. Beautiful nonetheless.",1454803200,,380,4.861538461538461
8479167,5,B005M5FBPW,Stunning. I have a large tv in the living room. Come Saturday. I put dvd on. Have drinks and music. Put some lamps on. And wow. Amazing. I love that the camera is steady.,1453766400,,170,4.029411764705882

8479169,1,B005M5FBPW,this video is nothing more that a few locations filmed for minutes and then on to the next fixed location videoed for a few minutes and ect ect..boring,1444953600,,151,4.428571428571429
8479170,4,B005M5FBPW,The sceneries are just wonderful.,1444867200,,33,5.8
