3558528,1,B001EYGOE2,"I was amazed and delighted watching live that first year of SNL when it launched in 1975.  Prior to that,  I was a fan of Michael O'Donaghue when he wrote for National Lampoon magazine, and I would listen over and over again to 8-track tapes I recorded of the Radio Hour (Don't you think... or don't you?  Even my wife now occasionally uses the phrase ""ironing the oak tree"" because I said it years ago.  I wonder if Michael wrote those words.)

This video is a near-complete waste of time.  Nothing funny at all here.  The only thing mildly interesting is the commentary track, a fellow writer talked about Michael, (but not a whole lot about what we were seeing.)",1232841600,,665,4.491666666666666
3558529,5,B001EYGOE2,"I saw Mondo Video 4 times during the week it ran theatrically, because I KNEW it would never be seen again.  I wanted to burn it into my brain. Happily, I was wrong.  One brave TV station in Pittsburgh actually ran it ONCE and I taped it. Now, SHOUT! has somehow seen fit to preserve it (or most of it) for posterity. Geez! Paul Anka is such a loser to deny permission to let them include Sid Vicious singing ""MY WAY"".  Anyway....

Definitely not for everyone, Mondo Video is for the adventurous who love dark, dark humor and appreciate the celebration of hype - as this is what O'Donoghue is doing here.  He endlessly promises the shocking, the perverted, the astounding...and just like the ""Mondo"" movies he's parodying, he doesn't deliver on the hype. But it's a VERY funny trip.

Much funnier than any of the alleged 'counter-culture' comics around today.

Very twisted.  Very funny.  A must-have.  If you have the cajones for it.",1231891200,9,934,4.640243902439025
3558530,4,B001EYGOE2,"Just to counteract the first customer review, let me say that I found a beat-up VHS copy of this a few years ago and became totally obsessed with it. It's wonderfully bizarre and dark, closer in spirit to the National Lampoon Radio Hour than the tame-by-comparison SNL. It's downright amazing that Shout! Factory is rescuing this from obscurity, and it will be a fantastic discovery for fans of Mike O'Donoghue and the other early SNL'ers, most of whom make brief appearances.",1227744000,13,476,4.888888888888889
3558531,1,B001EYGOE2,"I did see this as a theater release many years ago. It was in intended to have been a ""Saturday Night Live"" kind of special, but the NBC Network wouldn't run it.. So with some hype, it was released in theaters and it tanked.

It is an assembled collage of staged and public domain clips, arranged in no particular order and not making much sense.  Its funny value was lost on me, if indeed there was anything intended with that.

By the end of the 70 minutes, I felt my time had been wasted, and had a strong urge to request my money back.",1223164800,2,539,4.163461538461538
8299912,3,B001EYGOE2,"michael o'donoghue is the master of dark 70s humor.  but this show is a very hit-and-miss affair, with a loose tone and the strong smell of marijuana filling the air.  still, the occasional laugh-out-loud moment makes it worth seeing, if only for its historical interest.",1485388800,2,271,5.0
8299913,1,B001EYGOE2,This is a collection of edit room sweepings that has only mild nostalgic value.,1471478400,,79,4.714285714285714
8299914,1,B001EYGOE2,"The only explanation I can think of why anyone would give this production a positive review is because it was something irreverent for its time--and they were stoned out of their minds--the audience AND Michael O'Donahue. The few concepts that were mildly amusing or ""weird"" we're unjustifiably extended to full-length bits--like the laser bras which has its stoned audiences watching women zap bottle targets with their bras. We got the crust of the gag after the first six bottles were zapped.

Andy Kaufman was one of the few comedians that could do random, unexplainable weirdness and make it work. It's because he took everything WAY past the limit to the point of making the audience feel uncomfortable--and angry!! Mr. Mike just made me feel bored. Plus ""Mondo Vido"" is a parody of a mediocre film genre (the mondo documentaries) that had its hay day sixteen years earlier!

I can just see retro nerds watching this nowadays and saying ""This was sooooo before its time!! O'Donahue was a dark ground-breaking genius!!"".

 Ughhh....No, Ernie Kovacs was a ground-breaking genius.",1444953600,,1083,5.101694915254237
8299915,3,B001EYGOE2,"Since I like both Bill Murray and Dan Aykrold and I collect the films they are in, I just had to get this movie since it is so hard to find, Great laughs. You need to be a fan of Bill and Dan to apreciate this movie since it is not a ordinary type of movie you would expect from these two actors, But still maintains a lot of comedy.",1428451200,2,333,3.7714285714285714
8299916,5,B001EYGOE2,Great indie type movie - I had not seen this before and was pleasantly surprised - a worthwhile and entertaining way to spend 80 minutes.,1395878400,,137,4.52
8299917,4,B001EYGOE2,"Church of Jack Lord.  Laser bras.  Cat swimming.  Sid Vicious not singing ""My Way"".  Root Boy Slim singing to a lounge full of blow-up sex dolls.  This wasn't ready for late night commercial television in 1979.  Not quite so sure they are ready for it in 2013.  This piece stands as the epitaph for the macabre mind that was Michael O'Donoghue.  May God have mercy on your soul, Michael!",1358985600,2,387,4.507246376811594
8299918,4,B001EYGOE2,"It's a fun premise. And worth a watch. 4 stars only because it's an older video, so quality is patchy. I debated whether to give it 3 or 4 stars because of the quality, but I certainly wouldn't want to discourage anyone from watching it, so 4 stars it is!

I DO have to disclose that some of it hasn't aged well perhaps . . . oh well. It's not very expensive to watch, so go for it right?!

But either way - the Church of Jack Lord was stellar!!!

Also enjoyed the flashes of Robert Indiana's LOVE art (because I'm into that kind of thing).

The Island community towards the end made me spit out my drink all over myself!",1358985600,2,621,4.107438016528926
8299919,4,B001EYGOE2,"I agree with Mr. Schildberg.  This is a love-or-leave-it type of offering.  I give major kudos to ""Mr. Mike's Mondo Video"" for cluing me into Klaus Nomi: The 'dream sequence' which features him performing the aria from 'Samson and Delilah'.  Overall, it's really cool slices of twisted stuff/humor.  Not for everybody.",1236297600,3,318,5.176470588235294
8299920,5,B001EYGOE2,"You're either going to love this video or hate it. I fall into the love-it camp because the perverse and dark nature of its humor is entirely in keeping with the decadent style of one of my favorite artists, the great Michael O'Donoghue, brilliant National Lampoon editor and writer for Saturday Night Live. Mr. Mike's world view is on ample display for 70 minutes here, and it isn't pretty. It's twisted, cynical, and frequently marries the heroic to the mundane. If that's not a style of humor you enjoy, you will find this show off-putting and it will probably test your patience. If you believe the human race's worst instincts are fair game for satire, you will revel in how hilariously foolish we can be. Consider yourself warned.",1234310400,4,736,4.7578125
8299921,2,B001EYGOE2,"""Mondo Video"" was conceived as a summer replacement series for ""Saturday Night Live,"" produced by Lorne Michaels and written and hosted by SNL and ""National Lampoon"" veteran Michael ""Mr. Mike"" O'Donoghue.  A pilot was shot and rejected by NBC as being too disturbing even for late night.  Michaels and O'Donoghue took the pilot to Showtime who showed it...once, then canceled any plans to pursue the series.  The show had a very low-key history after that.  Showtime showed it again years later just to reassert rights to it.  It had a limited VHS release that was marred by Paul Anka (but more on that later), and had a couple of 35mm prints thrown for the festival circuit.

My mother managed to tape the original showing back in 1979, and it's been one of my greatest guilty pleasures. Now, to celebrate its 30th anniversary, it's finally been released on DVD, and to some degree I wish it hadn't been.

The loss of Sid Vicious' performance of ""My Way"" is understandable, as Paul Anka had blocked its being included in the VHS release, and it looks like they didn't even attempt to try to get the rights this time around as they just reused the scroll from the VHS version, to the point of referring to ""this videotape.""  The loss of one of my favorite segments was a letdown, even if an understandable one.

However, the real problem with this release is the nearly 25 minutes of previously unused material has been restored to the show with the DVD release.  With few exceptions (such as a bizarre little piece called ""Pat Nixon And The Mondo Video Dancers"") the restored material is terrible.  Like Saturday Night Live then (and now), the original NBC pilot of ""Mondo Video"" suffered from the need to fill 90 minutes of material when the writers only had about 45 good minutes.  The 50-minute edit aired by Showtime, and beloved by me for 30 years now, shows how much better Lorne and Mike worked when they needed to edit the final product.  I don't think there's a single wasted second in the Showtime version of the show, but there are whole sketches (like ""Crowd Scene"" and two ""Dream Sequences"") on this DVD that drag on for no good reason.  The DVD should have offered the Showtime edit, with the extra sketches as ""deleted scenes"" instead of re-editing them in.

On the bright side, the DVD also has three of O'Donoghue's ""Mr. Mike's Least Loved Bedtime Stories"" and Bill Murray's eulogy for O'Donoghue, which by themselves are really worth the cheap purchase price of the DVD.  But, really, this ""restored version"" is probably the biggest hatchet job since Ted Turner considered colorizing the first 10 minutes of ""The Wizard of Oz.""

Five stars for 90% of the material, negative one star for the final product, averaging out to two stars.  A pleasure and a disappointment at the same time.  A very mondo effect from a very mondo video.",1233705600,11,2849,4.696177062374246
