8097717,5,B000CCUF92,"Great funny Australian film, well worth the money, I really enjoyed the scenes around Kiama  especially the wedding at the old church where I have attended 2 Weddings before.  I would recommend to anyone who has a sense of humour.  Plus the making of the film ""Extras"" was worth watching too.",1361923200,,292,4.686274509803922
