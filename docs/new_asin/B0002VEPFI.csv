2124258,5,B0002VEPFI,"Love this workout. It is only 30 minutes long, but you really work up a sweat! The ab exercises are great. You can slim & tone your waistline without having to get down on the floor & do a bunch of those awful crunches. Love the red carpet! It reminded me of Billy's greatest workouts...the get ripped advanced series, and his live advanced series. This really gets your heart pumping and the moves are signature Billy.",1120867200,25,419,4.526315789473684
2124259,5,B0002VEPFI,"I previously left a review for Billy Blank's Tae Bo 2-pack dvd set which contains the fat blasting cardio and total body fat blaster...both are awesome workouts. This one is also incredible. Not as hard as the others I mentioned but still challenging, intense and fun.

Billy Blank's is very motivating, the people in his class are really working hard and are equally motivating. He talks you through everything as well. I admit, it is very challenging and a bit intimidating, especially to a beginner. I have been doing his dvd's for 3 weeks and not only has my body improved as far as toning and shape but I am stronger, more flexible and definitely more confident. My kicking has improved incredibly. I can balance myself with the use of my abs and kick straight out and hold it. I never was able to have such control before.

I totally recommend this dvd and suggest you just do some stretching before you begin because he does not stretch for long. Other than that, keep some water by your side and get ready to sweat...it won't take long at all. Don't give up, the payoff is worth it!!",1120089600,30,1091,4.532994923857868
2124260,2,B0002VEPFI,"I got this because I have heard a lot of good things about tae bo.  I thought maybe something new for the lower body (I normally do The Firm) and it was only half an hour.  But I could not hear a word the man said because of all the background noise, which did not spurn me on but irritated me.  I had the volume up as much as it could go but I still could not hear.  It's kind of necessary to hear how to do the move properly so you don't hurt yourself and so that you get the results you want.

I had my eyes pasted on the tv and to this day, I have an idea of what they are doing, but I don't feel like it's working because I'm sure I'm not doing it properly to get the full effect.  Billy, tell those people to pipe down please.",1116892800,3,732,3.7516339869281046

2124262,5,B0002VEPFI,"I have been doing this work-out for about a month now and have seen results. Not only have I lost inches, but my overall health has improved.

 Billy Blanks is encouraging and motivating.  The best part about this video is that it is only 35 minutes long.  I highly suggest this to anyone who is looking for a great cardio video in a short amount of time.",1111622400,10,355,4.253731343283582
2124263,5,B0002VEPFI,"This video is similar to the second one (Cardio Ciruit 2) except it is shorter -- this one is half an hour and the other one is an hour.  Billy is a great motivator and keeps you motivated throughout the whole workout.  He makes sure you are able to do the moves, and then you go to cardio mode to get a great workout.

I've been doing this video and the second one for over a month now and I love them.  I've mastered the moves and I am now able to really focus on the muscles I am supposed to be working.  I sweat like crazy everytime, and I'm seeing great results.",1108771200,8,567,3.982300884955752
2124264,5,B0002VEPFI,"I picked up this DVD because I was looking for a cardio workout after hitting a plateau using an elliptical machine, and it was the only one in the store without a perky blonde instructor.  (The last thing I want early in the morning is some rail-thin Barbie chirping at me!)

I got lucky with this purchase.  It's a fast-paced workout, and it does take a few times to get the hang of all the excercises.  Billy Blanks demonstrates well, it's just that some segments required a little practice before they felt comfortable.  But after using it for just a couple of weeks, along with a sensible diet, I've almost got my stomach (long lost to post-smoking poundage) back!  I've also got much more energy the rest of the day.  When I'm ready to vary my workout again, I'll be looking for more Billy Blanks DVDs.",1108512000,32,808,4.493150684931507
2124265,5,B0002VEPFI,"This DVD is my favorite Tae Bo yet! Billy Blanks breaks down the workout into different sections for your abs,upper body, and lower body. He motivates you to keep working, but doesn't push to hard and reminds you to stop and walk if you need to. This DVD is fun and energizes you. Great for anyone who wants cardio. You can also add strngth training by using the weight balls advertised with Tae Bo 2004 as a few of the cast memebers were using them.",1104624000,10,450,4.305882352941176

2124275,5,B0002VEPFI,"After reading reviews about several of Billy Blanks' DVDs (I own way too many workout DVDs so at this point I know what I'm looking for), I selected this one for it's length (about 36 minutes) and focus on cardio. I've grown to love Billy (dare I say ALMOST as much as I love Jillian Michaels?) and his great attitude. I do get a little frustrated when the number of reps done on each side is lost track of (sometimes I feel like I'm doing twice as many on the left as on the right), but once you get used to that, you can even it out! Overall, love the workout! Definitely one of my go-to's.",1393718400,,592,4.112068965517241
2124276,5,B0002VEPFI,"wonderful video, i can see results within 2 months my husband is chasing me all over the house, its best to incorporate this video with a good stretching one at least 3 times a week",1391126400,,181,4.2
2124277,5,B0002VEPFI,"I am an exercise NUT and I have tried it ALL - Jillian MIchaels, Jackie Warner, Denise Austin, and the list can go on for ten pages.  About ten years ago, I used this disc religiously and noticed incredible results so I bought all of Billy Blanks cd's thinking if this is so good, the others should be as well.  Sorry, Billy, but nothing compares to the magic formula you designed on this ONE disc. Because I didn't get good results with the other Billy dvds, I gave up on him altogether - BIG MISTAKE.  After 10 yrs of trying to get my tummy flat with every other workout on the planet, I finally came back to THIS DVD. I have cardio circuit 2 and it's a longer workout but not as effective.  Go figure.

I just recently repurchased this dvd as I lost my other one and sure enough within ONE week my abs are TIGHT and no crunches.  He is spot on right that abdominal floor exercises BUILD muscle whereas his twisting sequences on this dvd SLIM your tummy.  I bought three more of these exact same discs and put them in the fire-proof safe just in case they discontinue making it.

Don't be dismayed by the group doing the workout on the dvd - as most of them have sloppy bellies.  Believe me when I tell you - do this routine a few times a week and you will be glad you did.  It is not difficult at all.  In comparison to  Jillian's 30 Day Shred, this is a breeze AND a lot more effective!!

I am writing this as a selfish measure to ensure they keep this in stock.",1374796800,8,1466,4.137809187279152
2124278,5,B0002VEPFI,"No distracting extras, great pace and rhythm.  Not many new moves but when partnered with a heart rate monitor you will get about 400 averaged burned calories if you fight threw it.",1372896000,,181,4.65625
2124279,4,B0002VEPFI,This was a great price for a workout DVD and doesn't have its original case but DVD works great. I like the workout a lot too - it's 30 minutes and feels good to do.,1362614400,,165,3.742857142857143
2124280,5,B0002VEPFI,This is my all time favorite Billy Blanks workout. I am 42 years old and I love that I can do the whole workout. Work up a sweat everytime. Diffinatly gets your heart rate up also. Billy is great at motivatig you through. 30 minutes seems like 15 minutes. Great way to start the day. DVD was in excellant condition.,1349827200,2,315,4.266666666666667
2124281,5,B0002VEPFI,"I really liked this Tae Bo workout. It got me good and sweaty in 30 minutes. I consider myself to be in pretty good shape, and I felt challenged! Yet it is only about 30 minutes, so even a beginner could get through it. I felt like it worked by whole body really well, and there is a lot of concentration on the abs, which I appreciate after recently having my 3rd baby. I would definately recommend to anyone who wants to lose weight or tone up with a 30 minute workout.",1331510400,,471,4.130434782608695
2124282,5,B0002VEPFI,"I really like Tae Bo & I've done several different Tae Bo workouts.  The one and only complaint I have about it, is Billy will say ""Ok, one more set of 8"", and then start talking and you end up doing 4 more sets of 8.  I wouldn't even mind doing 4 more, but I'd like to know in advance and not be told I'm only doing 1! :)  It is a good workout though, and not super long which is nice.  You do burn a lot of calories!!",1327017600,,419,3.6741573033707864
2124283,2,B0002VEPFI,I'm a huge Billy fan. I've been doing Tae Bo for years. However I love the original Tae Bo basic workout on VHS & I have never found one available on DVD that equals it (IMO) This one is very high impact. He does this move where he stands still & twists at the waist. It's done for at least half the video. It's very boring & not good for your spine. He will do a set of moves & then go back to that insanely boring twisting. The video doesn't really get my heart rate up & it doesn't keep my interest. With the basic video he would do a set of moves & then go back to a boxing footwork type move. Much more interesting. I will keep searching for a better Tae Bo because I do love Billy,1322524800,2,686,3.872340425531915
2124284,5,B0002VEPFI,"This was the first Tae Bo dvd i ever bought and I swear it took me 3 weeks before I could get through it. It was 3 years ago. I am now obsessed, I have moved to more challenging workouts and I am never bored. I started at 160 lb....I am now a strong healthy 120 and I have never looked back. Billy is motivational, Shelly keeps you counting. Like he says you have to give some to get some. I absolutley love Tae Bo!!!!",1303171200,4,418,3.929411764705882
2124285,5,B0002VEPFI,"This video is a great workout, I was sore the next day after I did it, but then I continued doing it & not sore anymore, easy to get through & fun!  I recommend!",1293753600,,161,3.735294117647059
2124286,5,B0002VEPFI,"I find this workout to be another WINNER as part of the Tae-Bo collection!  It's far from a ""regular"" basic workout.  Billy Blanks goes above and beyond to give a good cardio workout along with working other body parts - legs, arms, abs, thighs, glutes, EVERYTHING! I'm always sweaty and feel great towards the end of the workout.  The most challenging parts are when he goes back into the twisting-ab workouts. In the beginning, when I'm still fresh, the abdominal circuit workouts aren't so bad, but close to the end, doing those twists can be hard!  However, I feel I reap the rewards after doing this workout.  Tighter abs, weight loss, gained muscle mass and strength!  I LOVE THIS WORKOUT!",1292371200,5,695,4.75
2124287,4,B0002VEPFI,"Blanks has some quirks--by right and left, he means stage right and stage left, in other words, stage right being left from the audience's perspective and stage left being on the audience's right, which can take some getting used to. Exercise videos often don't say ""cut"" when the instructor messes up from distracting themselves with too much talking. And they have to explain new moves to first timers, which gets old if you do the same video all the time. But by then you know the move and can work on through it.

Bottom line, this one is sufficiently challenging for up to an intermediate level, if a bit dull to start (I tend to zone out for about five or ten minutes between the warm up and the leg lifts if I'm not watching myself.) The length is just about perfect for someone looking for a half hour work out rather than 60-90 minutes.",1281830400,3,845,4.451612903225806
2124288,5,B0002VEPFI,This is a great Video for those who already know Billy Blanks moves.  It is high impact aerobics that will no doubt make you sweat!  The abdominal portion is awesome.  I can actually feel a difference after doing the video 2 times!  I would like more low impact with this video though.,1278460800,2,285,4.423076923076923
2124289,4,B0002VEPFI,"I am just getting back into a workout routine and I purchased this one to accompany other Tae Bo dvds that I have.  I love this one.  It is not too long, but not too short either.  It definitely works up a sweat for me, but it is not too difficult where I have to take a break.  I love the variety of things Billy has you do!",1275782400,2,325,3.735294117647059
2124290,4,B0002VEPFI,I recently purchased this DVD to lose some weight after having my kids. I have only done it one time since I got but man does it work you out. It's fast and if  you've never done Tae Bo it's hard to keep up. But once you get into the groove it becomes easier and you can definitely feel it the next day. I will definitely be using this DVD more often. It's only about 35 minutes so it goes by super fast but you get an amazing work out.,1268438400,2,436,3.8444444444444446
2124291,4,B0002VEPFI,"I've been doing tae bo for about 10 years and own well over 20 videos.  This one quickly became one that I do on a regular basis.  I got a great workout and really felt like I was working my mid-section, which is where I tend to have the most trouble.  The only thing I didn't like is that he tends to work one side more than the other, but I fixed that by working out the opposite side they were once in a while to kindof even things up.  Love the video tho and plan on wearing it out!",1264550400,2,486,3.83
2124292,5,B0002VEPFI,"CALORIE BURN:  I wear a bodybugg to measure my daily calorie burn which also allows me to measure how many calories I burn during a specific workout, as well as how many I burn per minute during the workout. I mention this only so you'll know what I say is based upon scientific  measurement rather than perceived exertion. This dvd ranked far higher than most of my exercise dvds on calorie burn. (and I own WAAY more fitness dvds than I should)

TONING: The beauty of Tae Bo is that you get cardio combined with toning but this ""circuit workout"" takes it to a new level.  The sheer act of kicking and punching elevates your heart in any workout, but Billy Blanks, in my opinion, really has worked his moves out to a great science (I do own several of his in addition to several other kickboxing, tae bo, etc workouts).  For example, this is an excellent ab workout due to the twists and moves created to engage your obliques.  However, whereas most of his other workouts are correlated to be utilizing certain moves and muscles continually, this one breaks up the dvd into circuits that focus on your upper body, lower body, and abs specifically. But the beauty of a circuit workout is that you are blasting calories due to the high heart rate, yet you are also toning by using your body to strengthen your muscles so that you continue to elevate your metabolism and calorie burn long after the workout is over.  You'll feel it and you'll get results. You'll use your body in this one for great strength training while your heartrate is elevated for calorie burn...doubling the results. I love that.

INSTRUCTION: I have several of Billy Blanks' dvds for a reason...he has great energy and always has exceptional workouts that scorch calories and tone well. I happen to love the counting down he does along with his group because it enables you to know you are to tempo and not have to stare at the tv the whole time if desired. It's also energizing.  His cueing is excellent as even a beginner would never miss a step.  Trust me, I have NO coordination in spite of the fact I workout often so cueing that's good is very, very important to me. I like that he provides a studio that's full of people. Keeps it interesting for me and this one had even more people than in many of his other dvds. Better yet, they were of varying fitness levels...some had rock hard abs, while some still needed some shaping. That's actually a good thing...no matter where you are in your fitness level you can both relate and be inspired. That said, they were all still fairly fit because it's difficult to do tae bo and not be in shape fairly quickly...this hits all the muscles.

LEVEL: There are no weights in this. Tae Bo is inherently designed that if you know how to kick and punch, you can do it.  You'll burn calories and firm up even if you workout daily. I feel this one even though I workout often but if I go for weeks without a workout I can still jump in do it.  I also ordered weighted gloves for when I really want to amp up my arm toning and burn.  Because the cueing and instruction is great, you can jump in and do tae bo on this one even if you never have before. In fact, the first Tae Bo I ever did was a short Billy Blanks dvd and it got me hooked.

LENGTH: 36 minutes. But even a 20 minute workout with this one is good.

MUSIC: Excellent and upbeat, not the boring electronica I often hear in fitness dvds.

SET: A very nice studio, full of people so there's many to follow and it's visually interesting.

ENERGY: Due to the instruction and team, it's through the roof. You know how, after you've done a set of reps that were tough, and the count is over you just wanna yell ""AAAAAAAH!"".  They do. As a group. It pumps you up and I can't really even say why. Tons of energy here in so many ways.

NEGATIVES: This is one of my favorite workouts that I own so I'm reaching to find a negative on this one...Honestly I don't know of any other than the fact that someone needs to throw Billy a towel every now and again because the poor guy drips all over the place but he's such an energetic instructor and I typically can get bored easily in dvds...so who cares.

ALTERNATIVES: These are some other workouts I like with similar results:

The Firm: Pump, Jump, n Jab
Billy Blanks': Tae Bo Extreme
Jillian Michaels: The Biggest Winner Cardio Kickbox
10 Minute Solution: Knockout Body

CONCLUSION: I have a full library of fitness dvds and this remains a favorite.",1262044800,21,4466,4.399756986634265
2124293,5,B0002VEPFI,"This is a great cardio workout DVD.  It might not be for a true beginner, but I found it refreshingly motivating.  I am not in the best shape, but I am in descent shape.  I couldn't get through the entire DVD at first, but after a few weeks of sticking to it, I managed to make it all the way through.  Billy Blanks is a great instructor and he has other people keeping count while he talks to motivate.

This Cardio Circuit is literally the exact same Tae Bo moves as the other video, only faster and without stopping.  There is no slow speed to start; they just launch right into the routine.  I also have to say that there were WAY too many people in the background of this video - it is so distracting and you can barely hear Billy speaking. If you like BB Tae Bo, I highly recommend getting his regular cardio video, not this one.",1247616000,4,596,4.351351351351352

After doing all three workouts for YEARS, I was bored.  This is the perfect alternative to the Basic Tae Bo workout.  It's a bit longer (30ish minutes or so) but not too long.  And it's more challenging than the Basic but not too difficult.  Now when I don't have an hour to spend working out I do this workout and feel great when I'm done.

He constantly repeats the same thing over and over again.  Just demonstrate the different moves and close your yap.  His constant talking even affects the balance of the workouts - sometimes your are doing 5 reps on the left side and only 3 on the right because he is constantly talking and loses track of the workout.

Billy Blanks is inspiring and since the rest of the crew is keeping count, he doesn't get off when he goes back to working out after some instruction.  I have slimmed down my abs and made my legs leaner and stronger.  This workout doesn't bulk you up - it does a nice job of toning and making you look leaner.

But I really recommend this dvd for anyone who wants to lose weight. it doesn't take as long to see the good results as it does with other workouts (especially if you, unlike me, have healthy eating habits). It's very intense and it may take you a couple of tries to do it without needing to take breaks every 2 minutes. besides losing weight, you will also find that you become more flexible and can kick higher. one of my only complaints about this is that sometimes he's so busy talking, he forgets how many sets have been done and you end up doing twice as many sets of an exercise on one leg than on the other leg. if you're a beginner, you may not be able to do this (but give it a try), but if you would like something more basic, i would suggest doing ""tae-bo basic workout"" (VHS) first. Judging by the way things went with me, i'd say that by doing this everyday for two weeks and eating well, you'll begin to see great results. totally worth buying.",1149897600,7,1203,4.189655172413793
2124304,4,B0002VEPFI,"I'm a huge Taebo fan and have been doing it on and off for about eight years. A few months after having my daughter, I decided it was time to up my workouts and turned once again to Taebo.  I bought this video after starting out with the Taebo Cardio video.  This video is very fast paced and wonderful for a quick, but effective workout.  It's divided into abs, upper body, lower body and then an all body segment.  The all body segment is very fast paced and will get your heart rate up.  The only two negative comments I have; but are very typical of Taebo, are; his counting is uneven (he'll do two sets on one side and then four on the next) and there are a couple exercises where I feel that I'm a little ""out of control"" when he has you pick up the pace.  Other than that, I can't complain because it's a great cardio workout in just 30 minutes.",1139184000,10,852,4.133333333333334
2124305,2,B0002VEPFI,"I didn't totally sink this DVD, because it does give you a cardo workout.  However, there are several problems with Billy Blanks' instructional techniques.

1. He doesn't give you even reps. on each side of your body.  He is so busy talking and walking around, he forgets to keep track of how many counts of 8 have passed.  So you end up doing 2 counts of 8 on the right leg, then 4 counts of 8 on the left leg.  This is through out the whole video, so your body does not get an even workout.

2. He doesn't know how to instruct for a camera.  When he says ""Right leg,"" he means his own right leg.  (Your left leg.)  To keep mirroring him, you have to remind your self to always use the opposite side of your body.  This is for every exercise on the DVD.  It gets old having to second guess his instructions.  I want to enjoy a workout and put my all into it.  That is hard to do when you are busy correcting the instructor's mistakes.

3. He doesn't bother with proper form.  If you are just wanting to sweat, without concern for proper technique, this isn't a problem.  For people who want to learn real form, look elsewhere.

4. (This one is actually more of a production problem than a problem with Blanks.) There is a woman wearing a microphone who is counting 8 all the way through the workout.  The problem is they didn't bother to put a microphone on Blanks, so the woman is louder than he is.  The rest of the crowd on the DVD is counting with her, so Blanks is very hard to hear.

I had high hopes for this video because I love kickboxing.  But I got frustrated and turned it off half way through.",1128124800,24,1607,4.169381107491857
