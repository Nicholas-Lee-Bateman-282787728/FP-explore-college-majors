7845893,5,6303421881,"I would say this is the greatest Chuck Norris movie, no wait, the greatest movie of all-time except for one thing.  And that is that all Chuck Norris movies are created equal and better then movies like the Godfather, Schlinder's List, Back Door Sluts 9, and Braveheart combined.  Chuck Norris is a much better actor then Tom Hanks and Marlon Brando because he knows karate.  Hell Chuck Norris invented Karate as well as Judo, Kung Fu, and Hamster style Jap Slapping.  Do yourself a favor and buy this movie so you can call yourself a man.  And if your a woman buy this movie and pray Chuck Norris comes to your house and gets you pregnant.
