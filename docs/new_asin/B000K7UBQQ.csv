2683641,5,B000K7UBQQ,Excellant DVD that covers many counties of Ireland-a must see prior to visiting this gorgeous land-Rick Steves' is an excellant host and I most likely will purchase other videos in this series,1267660800,2,192,5.03125
2683642,5,B000K7UBQQ,"I bought this DVD because it included the places I visited in 2006 -- the West Country of Ireland. As always, Steves makes everything both interesting and enjoyable -- and gives good advice in the process. Even if you can't actually go 'cross the pond... well, it's not quite as good -- but maybe it will hold you until you can get on that plane.  Oh, and be sure to watch the out-takes during the credits.  I hope Rick Steves is as nice as he comes across in his shows!  Bon voyage!",1248220800,6,483,4.228260869565218
2683643,4,B000K7UBQQ,Beautiful countries and Rick Steves makes it look like an easy trip.  I would have liked a little more specific information on places to stay at each location.,1239926400,,159,4.678571428571429
2683644,5,B000K7UBQQ,I have been to Ireland and all over Scotland on many trips.  This DVD provides a pretty fair representation of both.  I would indeed recommend it to friend and family.,1230076800,5,167,4.533333333333333
2683645,5,B000K7UBQQ,Rick Steves travel DVDs are such a pleasure to watch and enjoy. This DVD of Ireland and Scotland is especially wonderful and the scenery is magnificent.,1226448000,2,152,4.884615384615385
2683646,5,B000K7UBQQ,"Has there ever been another travel guide more amiable, more informative, more eclectic and just plain likeable than Rick Steves?  This somewhat nerdish but pleasant looking fellow will immediately win the viewer over with his charm, humor and smoothing, layback manner. However what will keep you watching program after program is his consummate knowledge of the sites and people he visits.

While each journey is only 30 minutes in length Rick has a unique talent of synthesizing the many facets that make up a people and place. He leaves no stone unturned in his analysis; historical background, spiritual heritage, cultural underpinnings and political legacy are all equally touched upon to give the audience a fuller understanding of the rural and urban landscape.

However not not an individual to dwell too much on the past, he provides a delightful tour of the markets, music, restaurants and nightlife. The kind of information would really want to know if you're out for a good time.

The production values are also wonderful offering fanstastic visuals that are worth watching even if there where no commentary. Traveling with Rick Steves' is the next best thing to being there.

This particular DVD contains six episodes, thirty minutes in length. Imagine three hours in Ireland and Scotland await, better get started!",1207526400,15,1328,5.186915887850467

2683687,4,B000K7UBQQ,"I generally like Rick Steves, but he covers only the major tourist destinations.  There are many interesting places that he does not show or seem to know about: in Belfast, there is most bombed hotel in the world; there is an Ulster America Folk Park in County Tyrone that is fascinating.  In Scotland, he could have shown remnants of Roman Roads, Norman churches, and St. Andrews.",1401321600,,381,4.757575757575758
2683688,3,B000K7UBQQ,"This CD lives up the to usual quality, and content you expect from Rick Steves.  BUT - it did not play in my dvd player.  Luckily it did play on my computer or I would have been very unhappy.  They need to monitor the QC a bit more and be sure of the maximum compatibility or give a big warning in the purchase process regarding the DVD format they are and are NOT compatible with.",1400112000,,381,4.053333333333334

2683692,5,B000K7UBQQ,I have thoroughly enjoyed this series.  I used Rick's books for 2 trips to Italy and was able to plan everything without the use of a tour guide. (Rick's material was the guide)  I am now using these videos to research a trip to Ireland and have already benefited.  Anyone wanting to travel overseas should definitely check out the available resources from Rick Steves.,1370822400,,369,4.734375
