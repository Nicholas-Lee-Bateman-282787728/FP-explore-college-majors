7865897,4,6304216947,"This is quite a good thriller, that has been ignored almost completely. Sean Young plays the part of a forensic artist who specialices in faces seen by witnesses. She ends up drawing a face from her own memory instead  of the witness's and can not explain this. It is hardly my place to reveal  the plot. Let it suffice to say, that it is quite good and even surprising  at times. The cast works well together and the movie has been well  directed. Despite negative press and an indifferent public Evil Has a Face  is an interesting movie for every fan of crime-thrillers.",951955200,6,572,4.514563106796117
