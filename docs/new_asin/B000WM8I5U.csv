8223806,5,B000WM8I5U,Manhoef is a real assassin though I suspect steroids but in a fight where you can get creamed a person would need to be on steroids-the ring girls keep things moving right along!,1405641600,,178,4.424242424242424
8223807,1,B000WM8I5U,"There were some really good fights on this event.  I only wish they would have shown them in their entirety.  For some reason the production team decided to run a graphic announcing the round number for the first fifteen seconds of each round - meaning you don't get to see the first fifteen second of the round.  During many of the rounds you are missing opening punches and kicks, and in one case they are on the ground when the graphic goes away.  However, and this is what sent me to my keyboard in a rage, there is a nineteen second TKO in one of the fights (I won't spoil and tell you which one). Basically what you see is the graphic announcing Round One for fifteen seconds with the commentators going crazy, then the graphic disappears and you see the ref running in to stop the fight.  I'll probably regret this hasty review at a later date, but right now I'm furious. What could they possibly be thinking by doing that? Arrrgghh!",1232064000,2,940,4.410404624277457
