1143619,4,7885142566,"First things first: thank you IFC Films for picking up this movie for a US release! This movie is a remake of the 1960 Korean movie of the same name (but nicely updated), and what a delight it is from start to finish.

""The Housemaid"" (2010 release from Korea; 107 min.) brings the story of a girl who becomes the housemaid to a wiledly rich Korean family, where the wife is late-term pregnant with twins, and the husband eventually seduces the housemaid, who herself then becomes pregnant. I won't gon into any further story details as that would simply ruin the movie experience. But I just want to say that you will be very surprised, if not shocked, how it all turns out.

The acting is superb throughout, none more so than Jeon Do-yeon as the housemaid, but there are plenty of other great performances. Beware, this film moves at a glacially slow pace, no this isn't Iran Man 2, and I mean this as a complement. If you are in the mood for a great foreign movie, by all means, check this out! Miles better than most of the mainstream Hollywood movies these days. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1315267200,7,1087,4.5126903553299496
1143620,5,7885142566,"This movie is a remake of a 1960 Korean production. I have not seen this earlier film, but not to worry, the general themes covered in the recent version (English subtitles) have often been explored in cinema land.

It's about a young woman, Eun-yi (Do-yeon Jeon), who, due to economic necessity,  becomes a housemaid for a super-wealthy Korean family.  The maid is a pleasant, compassionate woman. Jung-Jae Lee plays the young patriarch of the family. He is used to having his way, or so says his heartless mother-in-law. So, he has his way with Eun-yi, even though he has a young daughter, and his wife is pregnant with twins. Most would say he did not rape the maid, but it's clear that she would lose her job if she did not submit.  Complicating the image of the rich guy using the poor woman is the fact that Eun-yi is attracted to him.

I do not want to reveal any more of the story. All of the actors were very sharp. We get a convincing image of the evil deeds of evil people who are rich enough to try to cover their tracks with cash.  Those who equate great wealth with moral bankruptcy will not be disappointed here.

One fascinating aspect of the film for me was how the opening sequence strongly suggested the story's conclusion. Throughout, I was thinking that I knew where it was headed. I will not tell you if I was right, but I will tell you that the conclusion was very powerful.",1312761600,36,1397,4.43359375

1143622,4,7885142566,"South Korean film maker Im Sang-soo has a history of embedding controversy in his films, most recently with his story of former South Korean President Park Chung-hee's assassination in The President's Last Bang.  He is back with this remake of a 1960 film by Kim Ki-young and it opens sharply, when a maid in a wealthy household leaps to her death in the city's business district.  The search for a replacement begins and Jeon Do-yeon, South Korea's best known actress, gets the role of Lee Eun-yi.

When the master of the house (Lee Jung-jae) and the new maid succumb to primal passion, (and I note here that the language of their promiscuity is more explicit than its visual depiction) Sang-soo devotes the rest of the film trying to determine the consequences.  Lee's roommate tries to bring the maid to her senses, but the large paychecks corrupt the moral vision of both women.  The senior servant in the household, Mrs. Cho, (Youn Yuh jung) gives an impressive performance with her worldliness, as well as her signature comment, repeated several times in the film, namely that we live in a world with the R.U.N.S.  Revolting, Ugly, Nauseating and Shameless.  Sometimes it's a funny comment, by the end of the film, it's also accurate.

Lee Hyung Deok's camera work throughout the film is stellar and in Jeon Do-yeon, Director Sang-soo has an actress who moves from searing inquiry to calm acceptance in two or three frames.  And he's come up with one of the most spectacular endings you'll see in cinema.  It will be up to the viewer to decide whether it's warranted.",1309305600,4,1573,4.792592592592593
1143623,5,7885142566,"There is some eroticism as required to drive the plot but it's not Girls Gone Wild nor is it a thriller in the vein of Fatal Attraction or Hand that Rocks the Cradle. It's really a drama. I enjoyed the movie thoroughly. The casting is great and the plot is sufficiently layered and complex that I had to watch it twice. Having said that, the director loses track of his story in the final scene. The relationship the audience will find most transcendent is that involving the nanny and the little girl whose parents are the most vile people ever presented. I won't spoil it for anyone but in the final scene there is wonderful opportunity for the director to resolve the story by having the little girl acknowledge her love for the nanny by looking at a little picture of the nanny or a little trinket given to her by the nanny or something. It's like watching Citizen Kane without the final ""rosebud"" scene.",1308960000,3,908,4.509090909090909

Extreme viciousness ensues as the various members of the household unite to take action to protect and preserve the family at whatever cost. exceptional performances from one and all in the cast down to the two young children of the couple. But the older house servant is riveting to watch with a beautifully layered performance reflecting all her desires, interests, anger, pain and rebellion, often simultaneously. Her performance alone would make the film worth watching and buying.

1143627,2,7885142566,"this film takes the dangerously scheming housemaid of the 1960 B&W original - and turns her into a ""victim"" of the rich family who hire her

this is the type of ""victim"" who at first accepts the husband into her bed despite the wife's considerate treatment of her - then eagerly welcomes him

but you shouldnt see it that way cuz the family is rich and heartless - as evidenced by their aloof manner - Western fashions - the cold empty silence of their spacious house - intruded on occasionally by the alien sounds of Western Classical music

theyre evil - so in this simpleminded universe - she must be the nice one - even the one family child loves her

at least the film is technically sophisticated compared to the primative original - with suitably spare dialog - and actors who neatly fit into the 2-dimensional roles

the characters are pawns in a screenplay - theres hardly an honest human moment thru out",1298160000,,913,4.5426829268292686
1143628,5,7885142566,"I heard the announcement this movie would be remade with skepticism. When this DVD came out, I made sure I watched the original 1960 movie FIRST. Then the next day I watched this DVD from Amazon. Wow. For once, a remake that is not made from a blueprint of the original with the intent to cash in from the original's acclaim. This adaption is inspired and original in its own way. The direction and cinematography is amazing, the actors fit their role perfectly, and the plot is clever with a climax that is breathtaking. Definitely not for children with all the sultry sex scenes. This DVD was awesome. Rest assured, it will play in the USA (thank god).",1294790400,39,654,4.5508474576271185
1143888,5,7885142566,"SPOILERS The Housemaid is a steamy, sexy slow-burner of a movie. It's advertised as a thriller but it ain't no thriller - it's more of a family drama with lots of sexy intrigue. I enjoyed every second of this, from the beginning moments that warn us of what's to come when an apparently despondent young lady leaps from a building in the nightclub district to the wacky,off-kilter ending (a bizarre outside birthday party with the characters suddenly speaking English). The sex scenes are intense and the characters are vividly drawn. Apparently this is based on an older film of the same name, but that means absolutely nothing to me.

1143897,5,7885142566,"I could say ""The Ending!!!"" ten thousand times and consider it a sufficient review, but since I don't think that will help very many people, I'll put a little more sane effort into my review of this movie:

First off, I would like to say, I have not seen the original version of this movie. I don't watch subtitled movies very often (movies not made in/for America) because I some trouble keeping up with watching while reading what they're saying, but this film wasn't too bad with lots of stuff to read in little amounts of time.

The plot seemed a little slow at first (***POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING***) it seemed like a typical husband-cheating-with-maid story -- but once the surprise baby comes into the mix, all hell breaks loose. There is so much betrayal and ill-intended situations in this movie that it's crazy -- in a good way.

The ending is what totally sold the movie for me, something I wasn't totally expecting. I think I sat, like an idiot, staring at the screen like ""...holy CRAP!"" for several long seconds before my brain rebooted from a mental freeze because of it.

...And then there was the very ending, like nothing happened. Nothing to everyone but Nami... Little, sweet Nami, who seems to see the world in a more adult way than any of the actual adults -- will she become selfish and arrogant like her parents, or will she learn from this horrifying lesson...?

I wish there was a follow-up movie so we could find out!",1410825600,2,1443,4.599221789883268

I also know that in the East there is a history of suicidal protests like 1) Buddhist monk burned himself to death in 1960's Vietnam, 2) girls burning themselves protesting their husbands in Afghanistan, 3) Japanese jumping off cliffs with babies in arms because they feared the Americans at end of WWII, 4) Japanese samurai's hary cary, 5) 17 suicides in Chinese factory in 2 years because of poor working conditions.

1144013,5,7885142566,"When the first scene started, I already had an idea of how the movie would conclude. Although, I admit that it was much more dramatic than I anticipated, it was still a great movie. A new, young housemaid in the house of a powerful businessman, combine that with a conniving and controlling mother-in-law, a jealous housewife, a torn daughter, and a silent but powerful head maid who was the one running things behind closed doors and that makes for an interesting movie!

From what I understand, this was a remake of a 1960 film with the same title. This modernized version did have more sexuality than its predecessor, but it didn't take away from the story as much as I thought it would. While watching the movie, you can begin to feel the tension rise in the house, so much so that when the climax arrives you think it would blow the cap off the rest of the story. In the end, I felt like the movie had a very dark ending, a very surprising dark ending.

All in all, it was still a good movie to watch. I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would. Although, I did wonder what would have happened if she didn't decide to keep the child initially. Would she still have been alive? Would she still work for the family, or return to her old life?

1144787,3,7885142566,"A rich family hires a young, naive, live-in house servant/nanny.  She is seduced by the husband; the pregnant wife finds out that he has impregnated her.  The wife's mother is a ________ (fill in the blank with any horrible word); the other housekeeper knows the family well.  It's a bit more complex than this, and that is a problem.

The movie is a remake of an early-60s movie of the same name, which I have not seen, but need to see to get a better grip on this movie.

I really was consumed by the storyline.  It is well acted and written, for the most part.  I believe the problems lie in the background stories that are never revealed.  What does the husband do?  What is with the older housekeeper?  What is her dark secret?  The repetitious 'all men from that family are like that"" line means what?  There is a ""Dangerous Liaisons"" type of narrative, but some holes in the plot kept me hoping that there would be a well-rounded conclusion to the movie.  I even understood the ""descent into madness"" idea, but thought that the ending was way too rushed and holes left unfilled.

The movie needed another 20 minutes at least.  I know it is a big leap from the 1960s to include sex, nudity, language, and graphic violence, but was it really necessary in this movie?  I don't believe so.  I think it detracted to the story than make it more believable.  I didn't understand the very end, the outside dream-like scene.

3 1/2 of 5.  Rushed and a bit overzealous.  I've seen many Korean movies, some worse and some much better.  Funny - it would make a great propaganda showing for the North.",1366761600,,1595,4.465277777777778

The Housemaid, in her full humanity, is both object of exploitation, and controlling subject of her own destiny.  She resists not her desire, even in the face of one who would coerce her compliance.  She betrays not, even in the face of abandonment.

The exquisitely horrific conclusion issues from her dual fidelity to the young child of the household, and to the honorable reprisal permitted her upon suffering her humanity itself being betrayed.  Neither tragic nor pastoral, the housemaid embodies a somber judgment executed in a most unanticipated act of poetic justice meted out to all of us, witness, protagonist and antagonist alike.",1363478400,,887,5.3

I could care less about a happy ending, but I only found the fire to be confusing. If she wanted to do something for revenge, then why would she hide the evidence of her death by burning it. Did the house go up too? Also the ending scene seemed to be completely stupid and added nothing to the movie. Her revenge was to make them witness something horrible, but they seemed to forget about that pretty quickly. And hey the last maid was somewhat hot and my husband cheated, so now we'll hire two more even hotter maids and hope all's well. Apart from that it did have some interestingly shot scenes.

The third scene is when Mr Gob walking down to her bedroom.  Eun-yi was topless and watching her netbook or DVD player.
The director should shoot more details about that part of scene.  So explain the details why she was topless before Mr. Gob walk down to her bedroom.

1145448,5,7885142566,"I didn't see the 1960 version. All I can say is that I was mesmerized by Im Sang-soo's mise-en-scene. I suppose that the director wanted to ridicule the behaviour of certain members of the Korean upper-bourgeoisie by describing this family who borrowed the worst foibles of our western decadent civilizations. In this perspective, the surprise ending of the film boosts The Housemaid into a tragic dimension you won't leave unharmed. Masterpiece.",1326240000,4,446,5.295774647887324
1145449,3,7885142566,"A remake of the 1960's film of the same name, this remake has the same plot line as the original film. Eun-Yi ( Jeon Do - Yeon) works as a maid at a wealthy family's mansion. The husband starts cheating on his pregnant wife with this maid. This is not missed by the older house keeper or the wife's evil mother who start playing games to assert their power in the family. The maid becomes pregnant and the family starts to poison her in order to abort the baby.
This is a beautifully shot film, the dark gloomy mansion and the bleak atmosphere add to the tragedy about to unfold.  If you are looking for a film with a shocking twist, this is the film. Three stars. 111/28/2011",1324166400,4,676,4.28125

1145572,3,7885142566,"Spoilers ahead.

It was an entertaining though a really weird film. Basically, some chick gets a job at some wealthy and powerful executive's estate as a nanny/kid-watcher in South Korea. So her job is to watch over the man's pregnant wife and the household, as the wife is about to have a second child. During this time the man feels the need to be unfaithful and ""sow his oats"" but doesnt want to do it with his hideously pregnant wife and has seen too many Smokey The Pokey commercials (Remember kids ""Only you can prevent baby-poking!"") so he starts an illicit affair with the hot young nanny/maid/housebitch. Though, being a powerful executive, who probably does none of the work at his company besides holding meetings, he is quite stupid enough to forgo the use of protection (neither legal, prophylactic, or emergency&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/saran-wrap-classic/dp/B000GCOLZ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">saran wrap classic</a>). Of course, this leads the nanny to become pregnant by one overly aggressive supersperm, most undoubtedly the one that had spent all it's genesis training for this exact moment, after seeing many of it's comrades fall. After nanny-gate happens, the wife of executive and her evil Cruella Devil mother discover the nanny's pregnancy and the executive's infidelity. Being that they some GAKGATs (Gangsta Ass Koreans doing Gangsta Ass Things), they rough up that biatch a little bit. They try to coerce her into getting an abortion with some hush money. The nanny refuses after a deep existential and moral pondering about the justification of using her gladiatorial power to choose life or death for another living being, the most pertinent question that perturbs her soul is why should she be Judge Dread to an innocent soul? Nah...I'm just joshing ya! In reality she possibly sees the potential dolla dolla bills yall in the future. So, somehow the wife and the Mother-in-Law then basically poison our po' lil' knocked-up Cinderella with some magic Korean JuJu juice  (that is rumored to be a concoction of 2 parts Hi-fructose corn syrup, purple, 1 part early trimester RU-486 freshly ground, and a shot of SOJU for that kick) in order to  make her lose her baby in the bathtub...in a liquefying bloody mess....while Ace Of Base's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-That-She-Wants/dp/B001CB9EY4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All That She Wants</a>&nbsp;plays in the background.

She breaks back into the mansion and proceeds to acts way inane, nonsensical, and in no-way believable if it were real life. This is the point where you can actually start paying attention to the movie.

Seriously, just rent this and watch it for the ending it comes waaay outta left field and you'll be like A) How Big is This House?

1145574,4,7885142566,"This is a perfect illustration that money does not buy class(or happiness). As someone else noted, this is not so much a thriller as it is a drama which gets deeper and darker as it moves along. This is not a feel-good movie! It is a good story done well, but it will leave you with an uneasy feeling. Recommended with reservations.",1320364800,,332,4.370967741935484
1145575,5,7885142566,"I think this might fit into the melodrama category of film and it's really intense.  It gives you insight into a culture that is deeply rooted in beliefs and a class difference that is horribly divided.  By the end of the movie you almost won't be sure who to feel sorry for.  The protagonist and antagonist are so blurred at times you kind of wonder where the movie started and it's all so seamless.  The end is awesome and ties everything together.  You really see how emotion and cavalier actions can bring out the worst in people when it's not checked or controlled.

1145577,4,7885142566,"Far from being an intellectual reflection on infidelity, this asian melodrama takes a simple subject and handles it similarly. There's nothing complicated in it, it's easy to follow and half way you realize that what you're watching is simply an old-fashioned soap opera, similar to the mexican and venezuelan TV soap-operas shown after lunch for a housewife audience. Don't misunderstand this judgement, since the movie works wonderfully. It's beautifully done (the photography is excellent) and the acting is priceless. Most of all, it is great, great fun.

The actors dialog is out there and the male actor (who is actually gay) poses and makes you laugh.",1317081600,3,369,4.285714285714286
1145579,3,7885142566,"I have not seen the original 60's version, but it has to be much better than this one.  This film reveals little dialogue, but subtitles are easy to read.

There is a shocking beginning with a young girl who jumps off a balcony and we don't know what happened, nothing is said, so after watching the movie, you begin to assume what happened to that young girl.  The setting is a huge mansion of a very wealthy man, his pregnant wife, a little girl, and an elderly housekeeper.  Now, the premise of the film is that a young girl has been hired as the new housemaid who begins an affair with the rich man, who calls the shots and whose only given identity is of a classic pianist.  We don't learn anything else only that the husband exploits the help.

However, there isn't anything to indicate a slow building affair, they go right into the sex, lurid sex.  They have no connection, nothing to give the viewer something to build up upon.  It's slam bam, thank you mam.

We get a great view of the mansion, nice subtle background music, and we learn a little into the relationship of the elderly housekeeper and how she is indebted to the family.

But, other than the sex affair, what is there left?  Not enough punch for me, as much is left to the imagination.  There is moderate nudity with controlled sexual scenes.  But, there is an element of drama and suspense with a shocking twist to the end.  I might have to see the original 60's version.  ....Rizzo",1316908800,6,1457,4.424812030075188
