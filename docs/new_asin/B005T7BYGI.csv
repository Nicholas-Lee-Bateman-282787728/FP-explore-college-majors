4888227,3,B005T7BYGI,Remembered the first one from my childhood and enjoyed watching it again; second one is a serious yuck feature - does not even make B  movie status.,1372550400,,148,4.481481481481482
4888228,1,B005T7BYGI,"These are old movies republished as a package deal. Were not worth the time to watch them, in my opinion.",1370304000,,105,4.3
4888229,5,B005T7BYGI,"For only $4.99, this was a terrific deal.  I'd been looking for a copy of ""The Beast In The Cellar,"" which I recall fondly from my childhood.  This copy of the movie has excellent picture and sound quality, better than I've ever seen or heard it before.  It's also the full, unedited version as well.  The second feature, ""Horror Express,"" was one I'd never seen before, but it's an awesome movie.  Grab this deal!",1353715200,3,414,4.54054054054054
4888230,3,B005T7BYGI,"This was not a bad little double feature in terms of cost, although the second movie I'd never heard of and didn't particularly like it after I watched it. Either way, the low price and convenience made it worth while.",1338854400,2,218,4.475
4888231,4,B005T7BYGI,"The Lovecraftian Horror Express is the prize catch here! Peter Cushing paired with Christopher Lee, a Mad Monk, Yeti, Kojak & a full train car full of zombies! Now combine all of that with the intrigue of Murder on the Orient Express. Truly unique gem!",1449014400,,252,4.622222222222222
4888232,3,B005T7BYGI,"I'm wondering who thought these films made a suitable double feature.  Horror Express has one of the silliest plots I've experienced.  It's always fun to watch Christopher Lee (not a villain, for a change) and Peter Cushing.  Telly Savalas pops up (almost literally) as a Cossack.  Despite the not particularly successful staging of several murders, The Beast in the Cellar is not really a horror movie.  It provides the opportunity for two fine character actresses to play off each other.  It is, in the end, a very sad movie.  Love is sometimes as dangerous as hatred.",1446249600,2,570,4.875

4888234,3,B005T7BYGI,"its your typical 70's horror.
A lot of fun.",1440892800,,43,3.888888888888889
4888235,5,B005T7BYGI,"Double feature terror! Both movies are set in Brittain and have the old suspense and murder scenarios. I would like to focus on the second movie. ""The Beast in the Cellar."" It's a sad thing when two spinster ladies brick their brother up in the basement to keep him from going to be a soldier in the war, but two seemingly old ladies do just that. After about thirty years, the brother is still bricked up in a backyard, underground shed. By then, he is insane and who wouldn't be. I have to wonder why the spinsters were not arrested, for it's the same as kidnapping, cruelty, and a crime of a saddistic nature, especially when the older of the two sisters is the one calling all the shots.
This all comes to light when many murders occur of British soldiers--the brother has escaped and attacks men in uniform. When one sister finally calls the authorities and they hunt for the brother, to lock away for crimes of the insane, we get to see the older sister dressed in her father's officer's uniform from the war he participated in when he was alive. I get the feeling this older sister has been feeding her brother all those years dressed as her idolized father, in uniform. That is the reason the brother attacks soldiers. She's the sick one. Hunted by dogs and soldiers, the deranged brother makes his way back to his ""home"" where his two sisters are in bed. The eldest is dressed in full uniform---in bed! The brother goes ballistic when he sees her in uniform, for after all, she has been this jailer for most of his life. I won't spoil the ending, but I do wish the two sisters had been punished or at the very least ordered into therapy. A wasted life and a sadistic treatment by a family members have consequences.",1439942400,,1724,4.458860759493671

4888237,4,B005T7BYGI,"Telly,aka Pontius Pilate, aka Maggott, aka Blofeld, aka Big Joe, aka Sgt. Guffy, aka Kojak sans lolly steals the show.  Nevertheless, it's still a winner with the horror stalwarts: Chris & Peter.",1439078400,,195,5.09375
4888238,3,B005T7BYGI,I liked the train ride [ONLY].,1436400000,,30,4.166666666666667
4888239,2,B005T7BYGI,I was only interested in the second movie but could not access it,1431993600,,65,4.076923076923077
4888240,5,B005T7BYGI,"The Horror Express is a movie I watch at least once a year. Great atmosphere, setting, interesting story and what a cast!",1429315200,,121,4.545454545454546
4888245,3,B005T7BYGI,"This review is not for the movies, but for the transfers.  About 99 percent of people don't consider motion issues at all, or they just don't notice them.  I do, and it detracts from a film.  The definition of both transfers is excellent, but the aforementioned blurring in panning scenes are noticeable.  That occurs when the frames per second don't match.",1424995200,,357,4.80327868852459

4888247,4,B005T7BYGI,"Two bad, low budget, old movies.  They were great!  Actually the second one, Beast in the Cellar, had fairly good acting.",1410998400,,121,4.714285714285714

4888249,5,B005T7BYGI,"These two films are exquisitely done with great locations and wardrobes, cinematic veritas backdrops, sets, and acting done better than any of the newer ""so-called"" horror genre of today!  I saw Horror Express in a theatre when it was first released and the audience reactions of screams and gasps were priceless.  I, myself nearly jumped out of my skin several times.  Wunderbar and keep adding the Lee and Cushing era films, PLEASE!???",1395187200,12,437,5.041666666666667
4888250,1,B005T7BYGI,Amazon needs to get better movies.  That's why they are free with Prime Membership. Most of them are old. Would not recommend.,1391472000,,126,4.7272727272727275
4888251,5,B005T7BYGI,I just LOVE old movies...they're not jaded or tainted with CGI!!! No serious slashing involved!!! Just give me thrilling scares!!!,1389830400,5,130,5.55
4888252,5,B005T7BYGI,"Two beautifully restored classic horror movies from the '70's. DigicomTV has done an excellent job on both films, and the audio and picture quality are superb!

The first movie: 'The Horror Express' - This horror science-fiction thriller, a cult favorite, takes place in 1907. Professor Caxton (Christopher Lee), a fossil-hunter has discovered some sort of pre-human creature frozen in ancient Manchurian ice. He is traveling to London with his find on the Trans-Siberian Railway and is horrified to discover that his frozen man is missing, and corpses and zombies are appearing all over the train. It turns out that the frozen specimen is an alien with some unusual powers. The combined forces of Professor Caxton, his rival Dr. Wells (Peter Cushing), and a Cossack captain (Telly Savalas) are needed to save the world from this monstrous being. Skillfully told, with a good dose of humor. A great watch for the entire family!

The second classic film: 'Beast in The Cellar' - Two, eccentric, sweet elderly sisters are hiding a secret in their cellar. They both live together in an English country home in Lancashire, near an army training camp. And soldiers are being brutally murdered left and right. But, what are the sisters hiding in their cellar? And what or whom is it that they are both desperately trying to protect?

The sisters discuss their father who served in the first world war, and when he eventually came home from the war, he was never the same again. Instead of the handsome, young man who loved them and their mother, he became violent and mentally disturbed. Once Stephen, their younger brother was born, things got even worse in the household. As the years passed the household became a living hell for the sisters and their brother.

You really must watch this movie to see who the sisters are hiding in their cellar and how they are tied into all the murders taking place on the moors. It is an exceptional British horror classic from the 70's, and keeps you guessing all the way. I won't give the ending away because you really do need to view this for yourself, but I think you'll be surprised as to who or what was in the cellar, and how this terrific film ends.

These two films are a really good watch! I recommend both highly. These films are British movie making at its best. You won't be disappointed, that I can assure you!",1380844800,,2358,4.741463414634146

4888254,4,B005T7BYGI,"The first movie was a blast and if you forward to the last 20 minutes of the second it's a 3. I usually don't like to look at the different comparison to other movies but in this case it was fun at least on the first movie. You have an Italian production with Hammer film stars Cushing and Lee then you add Rasputin, The Thing, Kojak the Cossack, Night of the Living Dead and finish it up with run away train.
