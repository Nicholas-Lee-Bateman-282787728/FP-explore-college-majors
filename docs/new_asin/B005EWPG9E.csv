8469274,3,B005EWPG9E,"Stephen Fry is the compere for this five episode series on ... well... words. Or more importantly language.

The premise for this series is to look at how human beings communicate. Early episodes look at the way speech changes behaviours, has changed society and shows quite strongly the huge impact of writing on the development of civilisation. As the series progresses the author looks at items such as bad language (not an episode for the easily offended), the impact of the development of the printing press and its aiding the standardisation of the English language, the way in which translating words from one language to another produces problems of imparting meaning effectively and there is a degree of time spent discussing the value of books themselves - both as tools to impart knowledge and as things with an indefinable soul of their own - and also time is spent on the question of libraries and if they will remain relevant in the digital age.

Downsides are the fact that this is very UK-centric. An inordinate amount of time is spent swooning at the achievements of Shakespeare. But also the way in which many things are discussed in a way that makes you know the main target audience was British. And hey, fair enough too given it's a BBC production.

All up this was a series that had some fascinating sections (the look at languages that die while others stay strong for instance) and other sections that allowed the reader to reflect on how languages develop (the process of how new words get into the French language) and also how languages can effectively be revived or created (Klingon from the whimsical side and Hebrew on the more serious end of the spectrum). The downsides are however the way in which too much effort is put into subjects that are a little tedious - the aforementioned extended time spent on Shakespeare being a case in point. Put simply not even the engaging Fry can take his audience along for the ride in each segment.",1357430400,,1967,4.745614035087719
