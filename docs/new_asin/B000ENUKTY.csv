8111762,4,B000ENUKTY,"After the last volume of Desert Punk, I had lost complete hope in this series. While I knew it was about sexual humor and general hi-jinks, I also expected somewhat of a storyline in which to follow. Yet the last volume and the ones before it had very little in them besides episode plot lines, which I grew out of in the days of Looney Tunes. Plus, without any kind of continuing story, the humor just kind of grew old.

This volume, thankfully, seems to be heading in the right direction. It introduces a little more of the history of Desert Punk, casts some new light on the main characters of the story, including Punk's past, and even shows what could be the antagonistic force to the story. And it does all this while maintaining the humor. While no, it's definitely not the best anime, it's certainly getting better. It even has new opening and ending credits to signify the change.

If Desert Punk was a drunk staggering through the streets after the bars closed, then this volume would be him picking himself up off the ground after a particularly hard fall (volume three). Now, all he has to do is get home safely and I'm hoping the final two volumes can achieve this. Obviously, if you've been collecting the Desert Punk volumes, then I've no need to recommend it to you. But if you haven't and you're reading this out of curiosity, then I will only say that if you enjoy anime like Excel Saga then you'll love Desert Punk.",1151366400,3,1434,4.490421455938697
