8513959,5,B0026BRWAW,"This DVD is nice because it tells the story of Adam and Eve, Creation and Cain and Abel right from the Bible.  It's like the Bible accounts are lifted off the page and put into animation.  They are not diluted or watered down to try and make things funny, but rather they keep you interested because of the integrity and realness of it.  The lessons are fun and pure.",1245196800,,367,4.2898550724637685
