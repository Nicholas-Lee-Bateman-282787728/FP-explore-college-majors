7859516,4,6304042558,"The Gambling Terror, 1937 film

The story begins with men riding, shooting, and horses running. Men are shot in town by a gang. The newspaper headline says ""Organize And Fight!"". People doing business find its cheaper to pay rather than fight, and a lot healthier. The editor is threatened to stop. Elsewhere two men collect protection money and hit Jerry, a young boy. A man rides up to stop them. Jeff Hayes is in the gambling business. He refuses to join the ""Protection Association"". Is he a fool or a mighty brave man? Editor Garrett calls a Mass Meeting to discuss action against this extortion racket. Jeff shows three men he is quick on the draw and a good shot. An unknown man shoots Editor Garrett.

When two men try to collect extortion money Jeff is there to stop them. Miss Garrett asks the men to join a Vigilante Committee (a town militia) and hang all the gangsters. No sale. Dirk offers Jeff a chance to join their racket. Young Jerry goes looking for Jeff, and meets the gang. Jeff has a trick to get a message to the sheriff. Dirk reports Jeff's behavior to Bradley. A warning message is delivered to Miss Garrett. When the gang approaches the Carter ranch they find it well-defended, and are captured. Bradley and Dirk know it is time to make a get-away. The Sheriff tells the townsmen about Jeff. [I suspected this.] Bradley and Dirk escape in a wagon with Jerry as a hostage. Jeff catches up to them. The wagon and Bradley go over a cliff. Will there be a happy ending for Jeff and Miss Garrett? Will there be peace in the valley?

This uses the recurring themes of a prominent person in town who is the secret head of a criminal gang, and an undercover agent who is sent there to eliminate the gang. Its call for collective security against a gang must have had a meaning for that era.",1292371200,,1808,4.472727272727273

7859518,3,6304042558,"Producer A. W. Hackel completed sixteen B-type Westerns for penny pinching Supreme Pictures, most characterized by a basic linear storyline with this Johnny Mack Brown vehicle being true to the type, as well as one of the best, with Brown cast as Jeff Hayes in a unique role: operator of a traveling gambling operation, upon this occasion setting up his roulette wheel, poker tables, and other tools of the trade in the back room of a saloon, queerly enough encouraged to do so by the town's sheriff who is requesting assistance from old friend Hayes in a struggle against a local criminal group.  This is a self-styled ""cattleman's association"", collective villain of the melodrama, essentially a protection racket that demands ""dues"" from anyone owning one or more head of cattle.  It is managed by Brett (Charles King) although the actual boss of the organization is not revealed to its various henchmen, of whom ""Dirk"" (Dick Curtis) is the foremost collector of the mandatory membership fees.  Garrett (Frank Ball), publisher of the town's newspaper, is determined upon restoring freedom of choice to victims of the blackguards by utilizing the power of the press, and therefore is busily gathering resistance from among the hapless citizens impelled to pay for ""protection""; however, he and his daughter Betty (Iris Meredith) do not trust Hayes due to his gambling vocation, and when Jeff ostensibly becomes a member of the vicious gang, it would seem that any negative opinion of him has been validated.  Brown is impressive from his initial scene, both as actor and horseman, through the film's finale, while there is solid support turned in from Curtis and Meredith. A substantial assemblage of skillful Western supporting players is effective for this production by avoiding the omnipresent risk within this genre of cardboard characterization, while a well constructed script and the brisk editing of Roy Luby add value to this action propelled adventure tale.",1160265600,,1970,5.16614420062696
