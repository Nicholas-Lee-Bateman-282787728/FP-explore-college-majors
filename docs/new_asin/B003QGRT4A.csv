8402295,4,B003QGRT4A,"Marvelous film about the life of a family. Full of choices and changes which sometimes work out but often don't and the joys, regrets and reversals which result. Never seems forced or contrived as the family grows from the early 70s through 2009 or so.",1323475200,2,252,4.622222222222222
8402296,4,B003QGRT4A,"I randomly came across this movie at an Italian Film Festival in LA. The log line read something like ""An estranged son comes home to take care of his terminally ill mother"". I would never go out of my way to see a movie like that but a friend dragged me to see it. Once it started i sat there with open mouth. It's a finely woven, original, funny and heart breaking film. I'm still in awe of the director who managed to elevate the story above the most obvious emotion which is for the audience to cry for a dying mother. It is much more than that. You will experience nuances of emotions when watching this film. You will laugh, you will cry. It's just an incredible piece of work. I love this movie and regret that it's only available on Region 2 codec.",1304121600,3,756,4.220689655172414
8402297,4,B003QGRT4A,"The First Beautiful Thing was Italy's submission for this year's Best Foreign Language Film, and a good choice it was (even if the movie didn't finally make the short list). A film that spans two generations and moves back and forth to show us the mother of the family then and now, it has some spectacular performances, is rich in character and event, and unlocks to some extent the ""mystery"" of family that we all experience. One of the great strengths of the movie is that it will not compare to much else you've seen on this subject. It's an original.",1298332800,3,555,4.5049504950495045
8402298,5,B003QGRT4A,"You do not need to know why to buy it.  Trust me, as well as others, this movie is a MUST.",1294531200,2,90,3.2857142857142856
