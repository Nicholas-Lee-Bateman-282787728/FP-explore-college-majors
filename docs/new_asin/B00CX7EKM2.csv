5750685,5,B00CX7EKM2,"While I generally don't like ""found footage"" movies, this one is better than most. In fact, I'd go so far as to term it one of the best. It has something of a plot and brings the story to a somewhat satisfactory conclusion, with a ""shell"" of a story placed around the footage. The contrast between the methodical work of the detectives' studying the footage from phones and cams found at a horrendous crime scene and the fractic action on the films themselves plays off dramatically against each other. Letting the police react so emotionally to some of the scenes that they actually walk out of the viewing room add a realistic touch. Since most of the killings are done not in actual view of the audience, it's not all that gory, either.

This is one film I found well-made and well-acted and the twist at the end is a good one.

So some college age kids are on a trip to Las Vegas but they take a little side trip and end up broken down in the middle of nowhere.  Soon they are picked off by a crazy murderer one by one.  As you are watching the found footage, you are watching it along with the police characters who are watching the footage to try and find evidence in order to put the killer away.

As you are watching the footage, you start thinking you have it figured out, but then you have one surprise after another that shifts your suspicion from one character to another.  In the end it turns out the killer is someone whom you never expected in a million years.

5750689,2,B00CX7EKM2,"Im not a big fan of found-footage films but at least in Evidence there is a purpose to the footage.  After the brutal murders of several people at a rundown truck garage outside of Las Vegas, local detectives uncover several cameras and phones that recorded the deadly events.  Radha Mitchell and Stephen Moyer (True Blood) play detectives Burquez and Mitchell.  Reece has just returned to the forcethat every dayfrom a leave of absence which is never fully explained.  The fact that he would return and immediately be put on such a high profile case immediately stretches believability but its explained as Reese being an expert at analyzing video.

Frankly the half dozen characters that are stranded in the desert and terrorized by a maniac in a welding mask are not compelling in the least.  They are stock characters who get little character development.  The action shifts between the police lab and the found footage.  Reece tries to piece the video together; much of it damaged by fire and has to use computers to augment the footage as he tries to figure out the identity of the killer.

While there are plenty or red herring suspects tossed out therebasically every single character including possibly Reese himself, the mystery isn't all that difficult.  Director Olatunde Osunsanmi tips his hand within the first few minutes of the film and then numerous times throughout.  Who is going to continue to hold their camera and film the action when they are being attacked by a maniac?  The answer is no one would unless that person had a good REASON for filming the events.

Evidence is a tedious, predictable film that wastes the talents of Moyer and Mitchell.  Osunsanmis clumsy direction fails to any semblance of suspense.",1438387200,,1735,4.917525773195877

It's a bit of a challenge to write a review of Evidence without giving too much away, but I'll do my best to convey my thoughts on this film without ruining anything for you, should you choose to check it out.

First, this is a mix of found footage (actually, an integral part of the story), and standard photography. Second, it's as much a whodunit as it is a horror-thriller. Personally, during my first viewing, I have to be honest and admit I didn't know who was

I also thought the found footage camera work was really quite good. There is a portion of that includes ""nightvision"" which is actually black-and-white infrared-vision (white hot, black cold, or vice versa), something I've not come across often in handheld cam FF movies. And I really thought this was a pretty cool visual experience for a horror movie - definitely creepier than the usual nightvision (shades of green using ambient light).

Further, I thought the cast, overall, did turn in some pretty good performances (funnily enough, I found the ancillary female character, Katrina Fleishman, played by Dale Dickey, provided the best acting) and made for an overall decent experience as a result.

Now, most of the debate seems to be around the ending of the movie. Personally, I thought the final ending and plot twist was a bit silly and ultimately felt as though they'd taken it one twist too far. Other reviewers seem to agree, while others thought it made the whole movie really interesting. I did actually go back and watch this a second time, given the ending, as you're forced to view it all differently once youve finished watching it initially. Saying ay more than that would ruin the movie, so I'll leave it there.

Overall, I have to say it was interesting and I think it was worth the price of a rental, if ultimately capped off with a silly ending.",1426982400,,1851,4.700617283950617
5750693,3,B00CX7EKM2,It was okay but could have been better. The ending was quite shocking though. Would I recommend? I can't say that I would.,1425859200,,122,4.3478260869565215
5750694,5,B00CX7EKM2,"Not sure why this movie has received some negative reviews, I thought it was cleaver. A little predictable at times but still suspenseful. I don't want to give anything away but the ending had a nice little twist. Worth the view.",1422662400,,229,4.609756097560975
5750695,3,B00CX7EKM2,"I was a little conflicted as I watched Evidence.  You see, it's really two different movies happening at the same time.

In one half, a group of actors are running around in a found-footage slasher film.  The plot here is compelling (if a bit nonsensical), but the characters don't really get developed very well.  But despite the low budget, the director is able to wring some genuine scares out of this part of the movie, and he was able to use one of the film's conceits (the idea that a fiery explosion had ruined some of the camera footage) as a way to obscure the action and leave you in anticipation.

The other half of the film takes place in a police station, where much stronger actors (including Radha Mitchell, whom I've long thought of as underutilized) shout ridiculous things at video footage (Pan! Enhance! Zoom 40%!).  I'm not going to spoil the ending (which you probably won't anticipate), but suffice it to say that these officers do some pretty shoddy detective work.  But even though these scenes don't really hold up on their own, they act as a great framing device.  I don't mind found footage films in general, but I do sometimes get sick of the shakicam view.  Because the director kept switching back-and-forth between the handheld footage and the scenes from the station, I never found myself tired of the format.

This probably isn't a movie that you're going to revisit again after watching.  The big reveal at the end is a bit of a gimmick -- it's something that most forensic technicians are going to look for pretty much immediately.  And you'll wonder why so much time was spent hinting at the backstory of the male detective without any payoff (that time would have been better spent on almost any of the passengers on the bus).  I'm not claiming that this is a cinematic classic by any stretch, but I think it's far better than the 14/100 rating it currently holds on Metacritic.  I don't think it's the best found footage film I've ever watched, but it's probably the best one that was never released in the theaters.  I recommend giving it a try.",1421798400,,2084,4.625

5750704,2,B00CX7EKM2,"Strong production value, nice special effects, ambitious story structure, but ultimately it's all just a little dumb and not so thrilling. The opening ""frozen-time Matrix shot"" is particularly impressive, but nothing afterwards in the film comes close to being as interesting or engaging.

The film itself is a cross between CSI and found-footage slashers. Although it has a decent whodunnit mystery at its core, the characters and plotting is otherwise very vapid and straightforward. Some of the women in the found-footage section are particularly atrocious actors. It's obvious the filmmakers prized their looks over ability, as they are way too good-looking yet subpar thespians.

Every moment of action gets not only an undecipherable camera shaking, but some visual static too. So anytime something good might happen, you never see it. The film strives to have several spiffy twists to the plot, but when following along at home, they make little to no sense.",1406505600,,965,5.300653594771242

5750707,2,B00CX7EKM2,"(Not to be confused with a 2012 film Evidence directed by Howie Askins.)

Directed by Olatunde Osunsanmi (The Fourth Kind), Evidence is a new twist on the found-footage genre. The film is not just about watching events through the perspective of the camera (and its holder). It is also about putting together the multiple visual sources to solve a horrible murder case. The idea is not bad. Actually I found it intriguing. Sadly, in Evidence, bad direction ruins everything.

The film starts out pretty good, with one visually impressive sequence showing the crime scene, an abandoned gas station in the desert outside Las Vegas. There are several dead bodies, mutilated and burnt, and video cameras all heavily damaged. Two detectives played by Stephen Moyer and Radha Mitchell attempt to solve the case by piecing together the visual records left at the crime scene.

Each found-footage sequence is not very scary. The process of investigating the video evidence is not thrilling, either. In short, Evidence is slack and dull. About halfway through the story you stop caring. I like Radha Mitchell and enjoyed most of her films. Not here. But who can blame her when her character is bland and uninteresting?

As to what is finally revealed about these victims, you will find it either clever or silly. But most likely you will lose interest before you reach the conclusion.",1392076800,,1375,4.991266375545852

5750709,1,B00CX7EKM2,"I like Stephen Moyer.  A lot.  So I really wanted to like this film... but no such luck.  Had I realized before renting it that it was yet another of those hand-held jerky camera flicks, I would have moved right along and rented the original and best of that genre - The Blair Witch Project.  I know, I know, a lot of people hate Blair Witch, but at least I felt it was original for what it was, and not just another derivative imitation.  The first Paranormal Activity movie - ditto.  At least it was somewhat more thought-provoking.  But alas, EVIDENCE suffers from so many cliches and unanswerable questions that I had the plot twist figured out in the first 5 minutes.  In other words - it was transparent, predictable, and there was nothing new to hold the viewer's attention.  By the time the credits roll, you're actually grateful, but left wondering why you wasted almost 2 hours of time that you'll never be able to get back.

My advice to filmmakers at this point is - enough of the jerky hand-held camera FX.  Been there, done that.  And while you're at it, try having an actual SCRIPT.  If you can't come up with one, give me a call and I'll write you one that'll blow you away.  The real problem with films of this type is that they try to depend on shock value or cleverness, and the world has changed and evolved. We're no longer impressed by gore and glib dialog. We actually want substance. Think SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Think WITNESS (which has very LITTLE dialog, and none of it glib!).  Movies are about mood - and when they deteriorate to ""talking heads"" (the trademark of television vs. film) they become the kind of film that is quickly forgotten... but not quickly enough in this case.

Another problem with this movie is that there was NO character development.  The most interesting character was a 16-year old boy running away from home, but of course he's the first one killed, so the rest of the characters spend most of their time running in circles and serving themselves up to the killers like a bunch of drunken lemmings diving off the nearest cliff.  Finally, I've always wondered in movies like this why the characters don't get together and have a little pow-wow that goes something like this:  ""Let's see, folks.  When Joe Blow was killed, who among our group was unaccounted for?""  Gee... there's your killer(s).  If it's that easy to figure out, it ain't worth the time to destroy the ""evidence.""",1390521600,,2434,4.5704387990762125
5750710,3,B00CX7EKM2,"The movie is a typical slasher/mystery but with the twist at the end. I will not name the ""twist,"" so not to spoil the movie, but I can say that our society is fascinated with the ""twist,"" as we collectively do not attribute certain behaviors to certain members of society (The popularity of television shows examining this ""twist"" is proof of that). In any case, be warned that this movie is chock full of senseless violence which becomes more senseless by the end.

5750711,4,B00CX7EKM2,"In the desert of Nevada, police uncover one of the most brutal crime scenes they've ever seen. There are a ton of bodies that are so badly mutilated, that they can't even tell if their victims are male or female. There is also an overwhelming lack of evidence, that is except for one small mini-cam found amongst the ruble. Evidence was one of those films that wasn't great, but wasn't terrible either. There is enough going on that you will keep watching it and you will be glad you did! Watching as many movies as I do, I tend to figure things out pretty quickly, and I was sure I had this film figured out early on. As I got to the end of the film, I was sure I knew what happened, and I was somewhat disappointed at the predictable story. Then, the writers throw a huge twist into the plot that you will never see coming and it really makes the whole film. Evidence quickly becomes one of those films that will keep you thinking about it long after the credits role, and too me, that is the best kind of movie. No one of name really stars in this film and there really aren't any stand out performances, it's just one of those movies that stands on a strong story. I usually hate these cheaply made, found footage films. The plots are lazy and they rely on cheap scares and effects to make people jump, but Evidence wasn't like that. The film starts off really slowly, but gets better and better leading up to an ending that no one will ever see coming.

I consider myself easy to please when it comes to genre films. I don't expect any movie to venture too far outside of the lines these days. As much as I hate saying it, there really is nothing new under the sun. I just want the filmmakers to take what's been done before, shake it up a bit, and give it their own spin. Unfortunately, Image Entertainment's ""Evidence"" falls short of achieving the aforementioned goal.

Five people are murdered at an abandoned desert gas station. Two detectives are given the job of sifting through the only evidence left at the crime scene: video footage from the cell phones and cameras the victims shot. It soon becomes evident that the killer is playing with the two investigators. The two must now piece together what happened before the psychopath decides to strike again.

A friend of mine gave me some good advice one time. He told me that any drink or food that has more than one synonym in its description can't be good for you. I find this can apply to movies as well much of the time. ""Evidence"" is one of those films. It can be described using several different terms like horror, thriller, slasher, and found footage. If you can do it successfully, it really doesn't sound so weird to have these different elements mixed together.

The two biggest issues with ""Evidence"" is pacing and believability. Long stretches of nothing happen while people walk around with flashlights and cell phones, which gets old quickly. It sort of sabotages the element of surprise. How can we be surprised by something unexpected happening when we're constantly waiting for it? I can't even begin to tell you how implausible the outcome of the movie is.

The cast of ""Evidence"" is impressive for an indie film. It stars Stephen Moyer (""True Blood"") and Rhada Mitchell (""Silent Hill,"" ""Olympus Has Fallen"") as detectives investigating the killings. Torrey DeVitto from ""Pretty Little Liars"" plays lead victim Leann.

As I watched ""Evidence,"" I kept wondering if I would find Oren Peli's name among the producers of the film. It plays out like a drawn-out version of ""Friday the 13th"" meets ""The Chernobyl Diaries."" At least director Olatunde Osunsanmi was smart enough to pull out of the found footage enough to give audiences a break from the overused filming technique and show what sort of chops he really has.

If you like found footage and slasher movies, then ""Evidence"" might appeal to you. It tries really hard to mash the two sub-genres together. However, the film falls apart due to poor pacing and an unbelievable finale.",1379116800,4,2779,4.801255230125523

One or two cops, yes, but not a roomful of them.  The set-up gives the filmmakers the opportunity to make two completely different terrible movies in one--it's a found footage thriller, where the characters talk to the camera, shriek and argue a lot and are generally so annoying that you want them to get killed already and also a thoroughly inept police procedural, where the filmmakers reveal that everything they learned about police work came from watching bad television shows.  Then there's the ending--I don't doubt that the filmmakers think their twist ending was super clever but, seriously, a smart murderer isn't going to make a video saying look-at-me-I'm-the-murderer and deliver it to the media and the police because it makes it kind of hard to, you know, get away with the murders if everyone knows who you are and what you look like.

5750730,4,B00CX7EKM2,"This is a somewhat interesting mystery as a who-dun-it as we piece together clues from found footage. Reese (Stephen Moyer) and Burquez (Radha Mitchell) exam cell phone camera and camera films of killings from a scene for clues. We know two people have survived the ordeal, but we are not allowed to know who they are until late in the film.

The plot does give you enough clues as to figure out the culprit, but also throws in some head fakes. There are things which I thought was just bad film making, such as who films someone burning them, but may in fact be a clue.

This isn't the greatest found footage film or mystery out there, but will do in a pinch as a rental. Fair acting and plot.

8587126,4,B00CX7EKM2,"It's a pretty decent movie with the blending of 2 exhausted genres. It has a multitude of characters and some are even likeable and some aren't. Plus a burned out cop that every movie seems to have, but needs, because he is the only one trying to keep the investigation moving forward. It even has a ok plot twist at the end worthy of the Saw franchise, but not the original Saw cause that one was way better, but worthy enough to be a sequel. But sadly unlike the Saw franchise, this ending was void of any real purpose or motive other that ""Hey...! I'm just going to SNAP and go psycho for no real reason."" I'm sorry, but that's the God's honest truth. It's got good B & C stories (but without any pay off) built up as a distraction, but in that end they're not really the point. And in the end, as good as the build up and originality, the actual end and motivation (or lack of I should say) leaves you without that ""happy ending"" (wink wink) we all want in that parlor. I liked it, but only because I was bored at 2a.m. and everything else on Netflix was all the same old crap. I've watched it twice more to see if I missed something at the end to make me change my mind about the ending, but sadly I haven't and so my opinion stand firm. I liked it, but you may not.",1478822400,,1271,4.108433734939759
8587127,4,B00CX7EKM2,"Not bad found footage thriller. I liked they way it went back and worth between the detectives and the footage. I didn't see the twist coming, and I wouldn't say it was all that believable. Nonetheless, still a good, suspenseful movie.",1468022400,,235,4.7560975609756095
