2736650,5,B000ML8XMO,"Some fairly short movies seem interminable, while some lengthy ones zip right along.  For me, this was one of the latter, and I found my ignorance of Polish was not all that great a disadvantage.  Pretty legible subtitles along with visual clues convey more than enough information to make sense of the action --the story, after all, is not all that complicated, and this is still primarily a spectacular, not a highly cerebral drama.  I thought it outclassed the MGM film from 1951, which was entertaining enough.",1258848000,5,514,4.885057471264368
2736651,1,B000ML8XMO,"I purchased this dvd on the basis of earlier reviews, but was extremely disappointed.  If one expects the quality of HBO's Rome or Showtime's The Tudors, the expectation will be way too high.  Calling it more a lower grade tv production (but still no match to BBC's I Claudius) is more correct.  The length is tedious, the colour washed out, and the production sets only so-so.  The acting is more difficult to judge, since the dialogue is in Polish, but I saw no performance of better than average.  The English subtitles, like all subtitles, give only a synopsis of what is being said, and I found that many of them do not fit the screen.  If the dvd were cheaper, perhaps it would be acceptable, but at this price I would recommend buying the old MGM version of Quo Vadis which is vastly more entertaining and better edited.",1243123200,3,827,4.554054054054054
2736652,4,B000ML8XMO,Any viewer would immediately begin to compare it with the Hollywood epic of the past but in retelling the story the more youthful Polish actors are less stilted and plastic than Robert Taylor and Deborah Kerr.  Or was that due to the screenplay?  This version follows the novel much more closely and Nero does not dominate in the retelling even though I must admit I prefer Peter Ustinov's portrayal.  The only major flaw is the rather disjointed language of the subtitles that makes the viewer figure out what was actually being said.,1223596800,5,535,4.793478260869565
2736653,5,B000ML8XMO,"This is the only film version of the novel which is true to its time; some of the scenes seem to be Pompeian frescoes come to life. Early Imperial Rome had been reconstructed down to the most minute details, such as jewelry or colors of the clothing (other films, devoted to antique, too often have everybody wear marble whites). I also marveled at the music, which does not follow the convention based on the tunes of mountainous regions of the Balkans and Near East. Kaczmarek wrote incredibly beautiful music for the instruments used by the Romans, fitting melodies to the scenes; whenever needed, the music is solemn, at other times playful, or menacing, or joyous. Somehow, this music strikes me as being more like the one the ancients did play, than the monotonous drone of the Anatolian flute.

Speaking of historical veracity, I must make a special mention of Seneca, who, however marginal, seems to be a real Seneca resurrected from the dead. I don't know if this actor looks so naturally, or had been somehow made up - a mask perhaps? - but he could pose for the picture in a history manual. To show off this look better, his is photographed mainly in profile, just as real Seneca is shown in his surviving portraits.

Acting is good, with the exception of the female lead, who is an amateur and perhaps that's why she seems very often quite stiff. But, what Miss Mielcarz may lack in her acting skills, is more than compensated by her looks, and let's face it - Ligia is first a beauty, than a Christian, and a person last, and even in the book her character is not very well drawn. So it is not such a major flaw, and doesn't show too much against all other performances. I enjoyed in particular Poppea, who, in interpretation of Agnieszka Wagner, is a vile, self-serving, street-smart schemer, capable of manipulating the emperor, but at the same time a stupid woman, so fully convinced of her feminine power that she cannot see an impending death sentence on herself. In the circus scenes she affords us a glimpse into what is probably the most incomprehensible today aspect of the Roman psyche - enjoyment of the physical suffering of other people. Another spectacular performer is Trela, as a lowlife hoping to survive by deceiving the rich and powerful. These two - the empress and the beggar - convey the message that no life condition can prevent the person from foul acting, when the person lacks ethical standards.

I have been amazed to find comments of other reviewers concerning nudity and ""family values"". For once, nudity is necessary, because in some scenes full clothing would look outright false. Secondarily, the film is not intended for the puerile audience and parents seeking entertaining material for their offspring should turn to proper sources, such as Disney. There would be very little real art if all artistic endeavors were to defer to perceptions of children, and the deplorable state of art today is caused in large degree by the pressure to make all works kiddie-friendly. I bet the same persons must be deeply offended by paintings of Rubens' and the famous, much quoted in books and magazines, Michelangelo fresco on the Sistine ceiling with a totally naked Adam being freshly created. Those comments reminded me of a debate from many years before, when some political prudes were demanding to outlaw all representations of nudity as pornography. The proposed law has not been passed, precisely for the reason I mention - too much art of the greatest rank contains a lot of nudity. Therefore, I view those comments as expression of prudishness, and can only regret that the film did not attract more open-minded viewers.

The ending is different in the film than in the book, because the film is not a literal translation of the book into picture. I don't see there any ""logic of the events"" - Christians were persecuted whether Nero was dead or alive, because their religion directly opposed the imperial dogma, which cast the emperor in the role of god. Therefore, the death of St. Peter is not an outcome of some personal hostilities between him and Nero, but one more stage in the struggle against the evil. And the image of modern city serves as a memento that this struggle is not an affair of the past, but continues to be relevant also in our time.

This film is not just a visually great picture, it is also a statement about ethics, Christian values, morality. My only regret is that it does not lasts longer",1223078400,14,4464,4.747422680412371
2736654,5,B000ML8XMO,"While not flawless, this epic provides entertainment of epic proportions. A huge novel, written before every novelist hoped to see his work on the big screen, is gloriously re-imagined with stellar results. Sets, costumes, and look are lovely. The music is fine, the scenery stunning. And the cgi is gut-wrenching.

All of this is irrelevant however if the guts fail. (See HBO's Rome, for one ponderous, boring and vapid example.) Not here! The two central characters, Nero and Petronius, are perfectly portrayed. Nero is precisely as we imagine him, simpering, vain, timid, justifying, and vacillating. There is a scene in which he is jibbering to Petronius that, though I didn't understand the words, I completely understood his mind. Those who say he was insane miss the point. He was a flawed and weak man given unlimited power, with a desire to inflate his image and retain his position. His behaviors make absolute sense given that setting, and those who dismiss him as simply crazy deny one of the novel's, and the film's, major themes. Basing a state on one man, elevating that man to divinity, and celebrating his every uttterance as eternal creates a society where envy, jealousy, deceit, secret deals and intrigue rule the day. Gosh; what a surprisingly timely message......

Petronius is also perfect, played by an actor who can imbue a glance with more meaning than anyone I've seen since Bogart. When Nero's scatter-brained histrionics meet this calm intellectual, the results are exquisite.

The other beauty of this film is how it demonstrates the divergence between two world views. It is hard for us to imagine, as we are the descendants of these first century Christians, but in the Roman world the individual had no value. People like me were things to be used as needed, discarded when done. The novel works this theme with more vigor, in, for example, Vinicius' murder of his slave. This important and shocking event in the book gets but a couple of seconds in the film. Yet as we watch masses of Romans seeking earthly pleasures with abandon, since life can end at any time, and compare that with Christians who bring this new thing called love, we see just how far the world has come since those days. The lives of small people, whose death was entertainment for the masses, became worthy and valuable. As one born to low parents and plunked in the common schools, I can only shout, ""What a blessing.""

Gripping entertainment, this is both a worthy and loving adaptation of a great novel and a vastly entertaining film in its own right. Acting is (mostly) great; when we do not speak the language the acting is all the more important. Nearly everyone succeeds! Highly recommended! My only complaint is that I wish some extras showed how they made this. I usually don't really care, but this is so graphic and terrifying that I was amazed.

Note--there are DVDs of an abbreviated version and the full 6 episode version. The longer version is worth the hunt!",1215043200,12,2980,4.846758349705304
2736655,5,B000ML8XMO,"THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME. GREAT COSTUMES, ACTING, PLOT, DIRECTING, MUSIC ETC......  THE ONLY NEGATIVE IS THE NUDITY. NUMEROUS TIMES [...] ARE SHOWN.

I CONSTANTLY HAD THE REMOTE READY AND FAST FORWARDED PAST THE NUDITY. I THINK THE VIOLENCE IS TASTEFUL AND SERVES A PURPOSE. IT IS NOT EXCESSIVE NOR IS IT BLOODY AND GRATUITOUS. EXAMPLE: WHEN SHOWING THE CHRISTIANS BEING EATEN BY LIONS, IT DOES NOT SHOW A LOT OF BLOOD. THE AMOUNT OF SUSPENSE AND ANTICIPATION IS GREAT. THERE ARE MANY SCENES THAT WILL CAUSE A NORMAL PERSON TO GET CHOKED UP AND STRUGGLE TO HOLD BACK THE TEARS. THE ACTING IS TOP NOTCH. NOT ONE CORNY MOMENT IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE.

2736656,4,B000ML8XMO,"I owned and enjoyed the 1950's version of this piece for some time before the Polish update arrived in my box. More time was put into this series, as was stated in another post, therefore scenes don't appear as rushed. As a fan of series like HBO's Rome, I could appreciate the graphic nature of the film...life in Ancient Rome was graphic, so this production was only being faithful to the culture of the day. I also felt that the characters were more developed in this version than they were in the 1950's classic...we saw more of the Apostle Peter for instance and caught a more in-depth look at Nero's madness. The only thing that threw me off a bit, and left my rating short 1 star, was the order of events. If you know your history...then you, like I was, will be confused to see Nero's death preceding Peter's return to Rome so that 'Christ could be crucified a 2nd time."" I also would've like to see more of the Apostle Paul. Lastly, while I have an appreciation for movies that require subtitles, I feel that an English overdub feature would've been nice, considering that the Ancient Romans spoke Latin anyway. But oh well...a classic nonetheless. Buy the movie.",1189296000,7,1172,4.585714285714285
2736657,5,B000ML8XMO,"I chanced upon this superb Polish production of the classic Henryk Sienkiewicz novel while routinely checking up to see if the 1950 MGM version had arrived on DVD yet. What a great suprise and a treat to find this version available from Amazon, and at a great price! In widescreen and 5.1 Dolby Surround, with English subtitles in yellow.

Highly recommended for fellow biblical epic junkies like myself, this is a must see. As stated by fellow reviewers, there are parts that do not make this family friendly, but that fit in with the hsitorical context. Having not read the book yet, I was weaned on the 1950 Mervin Leroy version with Robert Taylor and Deborah Kerr. Although I miss Peter Ustinov as Nero and Leo Genn as Petronious in that earlier version, the leads in this 2002 production come across more believable as Marcus and Lygia. There is a particularly fascinating character, a little Greek weasel of an informant, who plays a connecting thread to the strengths and weaknesses of the different characters. His ultimate fate is one of the film's most touching moments.

Anyway, I can't say enough good things about this except forget the MGM verison for the time being and send away for this! You'll be glad you did!",1183248000,53,1228,4.76056338028169
2736658,3,B000ML8XMO,"This DVD is actually an expanded cut of the most expensive film in Polish history, which ran 3 hours.  This one is and hour and a half longer, as it was cut to a 6 one-hour-long TV miniseries format (45 minute episodes without commercials).  With the long format, scenes that seemed rushed in the theatrical cut now have a more appropriate pacing, and we see much more of the minor characters, most notably Glaucus, whose story should not be missed.  For those of you familiar with the book, this is the most straightforward and faithful representation of the classic novel made for the screen (those not familiar with the book, GET THAT FIRST).  MINOR SPOILER ALERT for those who don't know the story.

This version far surpasses the 1950 version and the Italian version of the 90s in faithfulness to the novel, in acting, and in production value.  The film is in the original Polish with English subtitles, which works well since the novel was originally in Polish.

Petronius is wonderful, coming across as thoughtful, sometimes cynical, and always witty.  Vinicius is marvelous, sufficiently impetuous and very convincing.  Ligia is played by a gorgeous Polish beauty and delivers well.  Incidentally, I have yet to see Ligia played by a brunette as she is supposed to be in the novel (the blonde Lygia seems to be a throwback to 1950).

Nero is nuts, and his delivery is a bit over-the-top.  Okay, very over-the-top.  This actor took theatricality to its extreme, which is, of course, a legitimate interpretation of Nero's character, and I think works better the story than Ustinov's bumbling version (though his acting was a joy to watch and the only high point of the 1950 version).

There are two reasons for docking this film two stars.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the film, mostly because I love the book, and as I said, this is a faithful representation of it.  But it has two major flaws:

1) It is too graphic, both in nudity and in violence (though if it were only in violence I might have given it 4 stars).  Nero's parties leave no Roman decadence to the imagination.  Polish bare breasted women galore.  Thankfully, that sort of stuff is only in scenes were they would logically be, and not scattered randomly throughout the film.  Happily, Ligia, even in scenes where she is unclothed (such as the changing scene and the bull scene), remains tastefully covered by strategically placed obstacles.

The violence of the Christian executions, likewise leaves nothing to the imagination.  While I generally don't have a problem with violence in film (I couldn't love Ridley Scott's historical epics if I did), this was a bit much.  I don't know exactly how they did it, but you actually witness people being mauled by lions in full frame--no extreme close-ups or cutaways here to obscure your view.

In any case the graphic nature of this film (especially the nudity) prevents it from being appropriate for the whole family, which is a real shame.

2)  They changed the order of events in the ending.  They wanted to end the film with St. Peter returning to Rome (oddly with St. Peter's Basilica prominently featured in the background) as some sort of Roman Catholic statement.  The problem with this is that they had to shift Nero's death a few scenes earlier in the film.  Which makes Peter's return to Rome rather pointless since the persecution would presumably have ended with the suicide of Nero a few scenes earlier.

They should have left the narrative untouched.  It made logical sense as it was and makes none at all as it is now.

In any case, definitely worth seeing, especially if you loved the book.  But not for family viewing.  For mature audiences only.  And you'll have to overlook the narrative flub at the end of the story.",1180742400,59,3757,4.761609907120743

It met all my expectations regarding the film - I am really very fond of it.

2736667,3,B000ML8XMO,"If you bought the 2001 version of this lavish Polish production of ""Quo Vadis,"" and are thinking of purchasing this newer 2007 version hoping it has been enhanced for the now common flat panel TV screens, forget it. Even though it claims to be presented in 16 X 9 aspect ratio on the box, you still get a small rectangular image surrounded by black bars. The color has been improved some, and the yellow subtitles fit the wide screen should you decide to ""blow up"" the image to fit the entire panel.

As to the film itself, it has good production values, good looking leads and the usual hammy Nero, but unlike the 1951 MGM ""tame"" version, this opus may not be suited for all families - the orgies are quite realistic, and so is the violence in Part Two: in the arena, children are seen being devoured by lions - courtesy of CGI tricks, of course - but these latter images may prove to be too strong for some stomachs.

Nevertheless, to present this magnificent Polish production in old fashioned letterbox format is inexcusable for such a ""recent"" release. Hopefully, there's a Blu-Ray version on the horizon that will be both anamorphic and will have a better color rendition, but until that day arrives, this is a rental and not a keeper.",1346025600,3,1241,4.560538116591928
