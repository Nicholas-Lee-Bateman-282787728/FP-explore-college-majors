616758,5,6303269826,I think that this is a great movie. And anyone who likes cowboys or great lawmen (Wyatt Earp ext.) should see this film. It's no doubt my favorite movie. And something else that makes it good is the fact that it's based on  the life of Wyatt Earp himself. Kevin Costner played the role of Wyatt Earp  with an uncante skill. I love this film and would recomend it to anyone!,935280000,,373,4.23943661971831
616759,4,6303269826,"When I saw the epic ""Wyatt Earp"" in the movie theaters, it was about 190 minutes long, and although I liked it, I couldn't honestly give it more than 3 stars.  This video expanded version (212 minutes), added greatly to  my enjoyment of this film in that it made the movie more seamless.  Although a bit dull in places (especially the first hour), the film picks  up speed and impact.  I found all the performances very good, especially  Dennis Quaid's interpretation of `Doc' Holliday (although I must admit I  liked Val Kilmer's interpretation better in ""Tombstone"" -- I think he had  better lines).  Actually, Quaid looked very much like real Holiday.
Richly textured, ""Wyatt Earp"" has a lot going for it (accuracy not  withstanding).  I don't know if there will ever be a definitive version on  this man's life, but I think this film probably comes as close as we are  going to get.  While it was a little difficult to sit in the theater for  more than 3 hours, this film should do very well in the video market.  Between 1 and 10, the expanded version of ""Wyatt Earp""gets a marginal 8.",929318400,4,1090,4.569948186528498
616760,4,6303269826,"If your wanting to see a truly accurate portrayal of Wyatt, keep waiting as it hasn't been made yet (and knowing Hollywood it never will). But seeing Dennis Quaid's portrayal of Doc Holliday is worth it alone. I've  heard people say this is more accurate than Tombstone but each movie has  about the same amount of goofs. It's incredible that a movie made on an  epic scale couldn't figure out a way to show Virgil and Morgans' shootings  on different nights! (They happened three months apart)",918518400,,494,4.709302325581396
616761,4,6303269826,"It is ironic that Wyatt Earp, who lived long enough to be a movie studio consultant, never saw his own story rendered into film.  Since Earp's death at the age of 84, there have been many such movies, and he has been  portrayed by Henry Fonda (_My Darling Clementine_), Burt Lancaster  (_Gunfight at O.K. Corral_), James Garner (_Hour of the Gun_ and _Sunset_),  Kurt Russell (_Tombstone_) and many others.  Regrettably, all of those  films attempt to improve upon what is already a fascinating story.
This  dark, biographical film is only three removes from the man, Wyatt Earp,  having passed first from Earp to his biographer, Stuart Lake, and now  through Kevin Costner's interpretation.  I suspect that we still have the  essential Wyatt Earp in this film, particularly as compared to efforts such  as the cartoonish _Tombstone_ which was released at about the same  time.
Unlike other reviewers, I find the film plodding at the start with  the real interest peaking after Earp becomes a lawman.  I would also note  that if the real-life Josephine Marcus was unhappy with Lake's biography,  she would be horrified at the depiction of her husband in this film.  But  then, Josephine was devoted to maintaining the two-dimensional lawman/hero  image of her husband.
Costner portrays Earp as what he claimed to be: a  businessman.  Earp brought the same pragmatic, hard-nosed approach to law  enforcement that he did to his other endeavors, exuding a cold ferocity and  ruthlessness that seems to have cowed opponents without the fatal use of  the officially sanctioned weapon he carried.  The film accurately portrays  the truly minimal killing done by Earp early in his career and up to the  point when the aftermath of the O.K. Corral signaled a homicidal vendetta  against the enemies of the Earps.
Costner was made to play Wyatt Earp,  but Dennis Quaid nearly steals the show with his interpretation of Doc  Holliday.  The first meeting between the two is one of the best scenes in  the film.
So far as there ever can be an accurate depiction of the  Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, it is presented in this film, as is the  aftermath.  With cinematography reminiscent of _Dances with Wolves_, and an  excellent score, this movie presents Earp as a human, three dimensional  character of flesh and blood.
This film deserves better consideration  than it has received from critics heretofore.  Taken in context and without  the misplaced desire for another _Dances with Wolves_, this is the  definitive film on the life and times of one of the West's legendary  figures.",915667200,2,2572,4.966981132075472
616762,2,6303269826,"Kostner had the right idea initially, but after a while it gets tedious.  While Quaid and Kostner do alright, one wonders about the rest of the cast.  Harmon seems better suited to play Johnny Ringo than the ineffectual  no-namer that does.  Interesting to see a less than heroic portrayl of Earp  (he's a good guy, yes, but a cold blooded killer as well), but that's all  this film has.",912729600,3,387,4.536231884057971

617211,5,6303269826,"Inevitable comparisons will be made between this epic, and the more action-oriented TOMBSTONE.  Both films came out within several months of each other, and the general impression I get is that Tombstone seems to be the favored film.  That being said, I have to say that I like one as much as the other, although they are two very different films covering familiar ground.  I've always been fascinated with the stories, and I think the only way you could really tell what ""historically happened"" would be to travel back in a time machine  and take a front row seat!  I appreciate that this film takes a look at Wyatts checkered past, leading up to the events at the OK corral.  His character doesn't seem to be ""whitewashed"", and the man is definitely not perfect, but you can appreciate him just the same.
In  the past, I thoroughly enjoyed director John Sturges' decades-apart films of the events, GUNFIGHT AT THE O.K. CORRAL(1957) and HOUR OF THE GUN (1967). I despise director John Ford's rediculous MY DARLING CLEMENTIME ( Tombstone,Az. set in Monument Valley? Pretty cute considering they're 505 miles apart, just for starters.) Frank Perry's DOC (1971) is a depressing mess.
Anyway, I highly recommend WYATT EARP as both an epic of the American West, and yet another fascinating version of the events preceding, and following probably the most famous shootout in American history.
I also recommend Blake Edwards' SUNSET, a fun imaginative story set in Hollywood in the 1920's, where Wyatt Earp (James Garner) arrives to be a technical advisor on a western starring Tom Mix.(Bruce Willis).",1507507200,3,1595,4.951310861423221

617216,5,6303269826,"We've seen many of the shows dealing with Tombstone and the O. K. Corral, vintage 1881, Arizona.  In descending order, they include ""Tombstone,"" starring Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer; ""My Darling Clementine,' with Henry Fonda, Victor Mature and Walter Brennan; ""Hour of the Gun,"" with James Garner and Jason Robards; ""Gunfight at the O. K. Corral,"" starring Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas; and ""Doc, with Stacey Keach and Faye Dunaway.  Much to our surprise, my wife and I would rate ""Wyatt Earp,"" starring Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid, as the best of the lot.  First and foremost, ""Wyatt Earp"" seems to hold most closely to the true saga of the title character, the showdown at the O. K. Corral, and the vengeful aftermath from that famous gun fight.  This is confirmed by the various documentaries one might see on YouTube, from the PBS ""American Experience"" show on Wyatt Earp and the early-1970's historical piece on the same topic narrated by Lorne Greene.  Back on ""Wyatt Earp,"" starring Kevin Costner, the movie is very long at over 3 hours; so we watched in two successive nights.  Some viewers complained about the early part of the show and the time taken with Wyatt's early years.  But these were quite valuable in trying to understand the man later in his life as he dealt with one crisis after another with his father's advice ringing in his ears.  In the film, the father is played by Gene Hackman, with his million-dollar voice; no wonder Wyatt listened.  It is true that the Val Kilmer performance as Doc Holliday in ""Tombstone"" is outstanding and he virtually steals that show.  But Dennis Quaid, as Doc,  is equally good in ""Wyatt Earp"" although his part seemed not as central to the story-telling.  (Jason Robards is quite good too as Doc Holliday, in ""Hour of the Gun."")  Nevertheless, both ""Wyatt Earp"" and ""Tombstone"" are worth seeing, with the overall merit for a true-to-life rendering of the story going to ""Wyatt Earp.""  Yes, the film can be violent and sleazy in places, but not without a reason to be so.  This movie was a lot better than we expected, prompting us to wonder what else Kevin Costner might have done that we haven't seen?  He is outstanding in his portrayal of Wyatt Earp, a tarnished and tortured hero who did the best he could with the odds against him.  In fact, the closing credits reveal he was never even wounded in all the battles and confrontations he was involved in.  One wonders, as a result, about his having some kind of Divine Protection.

617312,4,6303269826,"There's just no way to review this movie without comparing it to Tombstone. They were released together and both have the same real life characters heading for the same conclusion.

On paper this should be the better of the two movies. It's more historically accurate, the cinematography is more artistic, and the cast (for the most part) are known to be better actors. Too bad the flaws in this production are fatal and cancel all that out.

The main flaw is that in the interest of historical accuracy, this movie is just way too long and slow paced. Oh my, is this tedious to watch. All the time spent on heavy-handed foreshadowing and historical setting insults the audience and kills any momentum that might build up to the violence at the OK Corral. Another flaw is Kevin Costner. When he's good, he's great (Bull Durham, A Perfect world), but when he's bad he's ridiculous (Waterworld, Robin Hood). Here he's miscast and trying way too hard, and winds up overacting. He was going more for Master Thespian here than Wyatt Earp. This is a perfect example of the bad that can happen when an actor has enough money and clout to cast themselves in a role for which they are simply not suited.

Actor for actor most of the rest of the cast here turns in better performances than their counterpart in Tombstone, with the obvious exception of Michael Maddsen's Virgil Earp, which is simply not able to hold a candle to Sam Elliiot's portrayal. That stinks for Maddsen, because he's GOOD, and he's good here... but not Sam Elliot good.",1502496000,,1533,4.67037037037037

617316,2,6303269826,"Review of Wyatt Earp
Hot Toasty Rag, July 21, 2017

I always find it fun when a boring movies backstory is juicy; its like a consolation prize! So heres the deal with Wyatt Earp: Kevin Costner was going to star in Tombstone, but he split off from the project and co-produced Wyatt Earp with Lawrence Kasdan. Hed wanted the movie to be all about Wyatt, so hopefully he was happy with his own version. The ironic revenge of Tombstone? It was released six months earlier and made more money at the box office.

Now, to the movie. Its over three hours, which is an improvement over the 6-hour miniseries it was originally intended to be! But its still really long, and not in a good way. Some movies can get away with a slow pace, and this just isn't one of them. The cure for such terrible boredom would have been a title character so wonderful and easy to root for that the audience doesnt mind the slowness. In this version, Wyatt just isn't likable. Hes violent, vengeful, selfish, loses his temper constantly, and is a womanizer who doesnt have any respect for women. I don't usually have an issue with that, especially if its during a time period when respect for women is hard to find anyway, but the charm Wyatt uses during his romantic interactions is more offensive than appealing. I tried, but it was pretty impossible to root for Kevin Costner in this movie, and if you're not rooting for the hero, youve got a very long three hours in store for you.

My favorite version of this story is 1957s Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. But if you like modern westerns and Kevin Costner, watch Open Range. Its similar and much, much better.",1500595200,,1635,4.498316498316498

617381,5,6303269826,"It is often suggested that ""Wyatt Earp"" is easily dwarfed by the more glamorous ""Tombsone"", made in the same year. I beg to differ.  This is a far better film than Tombstone which, despite its beautiful cinematography, musical score, and staging, is plagued by some terrible hammy acting by the likes of Dana Delaney and Jason Priestly, who should never have been cast.  Moreover, Tombstone is  so overly stylized that it comes across as a virtual cartoon caricature of the people and events it depicts.  I also respectfully disagree with the consensus of critics on the performance of Val Kilmer, whose portrayal of Doc Holliday, while in many ways mesmerizing, suffers from a crass two dimensionality which alternately reduces the character's persona to that of mischievous satyr or full bore psychopath.  Dennis Quaid presents a far more complex and compelling image of a man who, despite his notorious gambling and violence, was in fact a matriculate of a prestigious dental college who carried himself with the aristocratic wit and manner of a patrician and consummate southern gentleman.  Overall, I find  ""Wyatt Earp"" to present a far more subtle,  understated , character-driven narrative, without so much heavy reliance on the tropes and devices of the Hollywood action kitsch which consistently mars Tombstone.  It tells the tale in a way that is ambitious and grand without succumbing to grandiosity and bathos.  To be sure, neither is film is perfect, and Kurt Russel makes for an imposing, if not, larger than life Earp.  While both films are ultimately worth watching for the unique elements each brings to the story, I feel on balance that the Costner version remains the most convincing cinematic presentation yet produced, and the only one that I would consider to be indispensable.",1498003200,,1799,5.1058020477815695

617614,4,6303269826,"This is the LONG version of the eventual Gunfight at the OK Corral.  WYATT EARP definitely regales more backstory for the Marshall who (somehow, luckily, by fear and/or reputation) is never shot while being shot at quite often; and (for example) risking his life in the face of a mob demanding to lynch a man without a trial:  ""I'll take 10 or 12 of you with me before you get him,""  Kevin Costner as Earp firmly states as he cocks the hammer.  Dozens of torch bearing hangmen disperse mumbling among themselves.
Costner is good as Wyatt, the other Earps (Michael Madsen as Virgil) hold their own with James Earp given a good part although he was never a lawman.  His wife (Jobeth Williams) works as a prostitute in a bar with James Earp knowing full well what she is doing because the money is good; and as James Earp states:  ""I'm not paying for it.""
The authenticity that sinks in while viewing WYATT EARP may have the more discerning movie-goer realizing EARP is actually better than the more immediately entertaining ""Tombstone"" which seemed to be more widely viewed and appreciated after similar release periods.  While Val Kilmer in Tombstone had the best part with all the quotable lines Dennis Quaid's portrayal of Doc Holliday deserves a reminder that his performance sure seems more authentic and believable as the gunfighter dying of tuberculosis.  Quaid is gaunt and menacing in his not as attractive roll, yet, he is still amusing while being a man of intense (for sure) loyalties. (story at the time was he really did make himself sick, losing weight to the point most of those around Quaid were really concerned about his health.)
No xtras on this one but I spent $4.09 for this well made Lawrence Kasdan western who had fared well with a less realistic but obviously intended western entertainment Silverado(1985).  Jeff Fahey (Ike Clanton) is in both westerns as was/is Costner.
One missing link is Johnny Ringo who was much more memorable in Tombstone as played by Michael Biehn.  Ringo is almost invisible in WYATT EARP story but there is more to do with the wives of the Earp brothers (in WYATT) while just the mere presence of the modern ""Jewish"" girl by old west standards (the lovely Joanna Going) is a major improvement over Dana Dalany in Tombstone, Wyatt's eventual soul mate.
WYATT EARP also explains a very close ""family"" type relationship with Bat Masterson and his younger brother (Tom Sizemore and Bill Pullman, respectively) who worked with and for WYATT EARP as buffalo skinners before becoming lawmen also!
This is a good history of WYATT EARP and his brothers (Virgil, Morgan, James ... and Warren) with Gene Hackman appearing as the Earp patriarch who instills Wyatt with a simple moral code.
Tea Leoni has a small but rather sexy part.  Betty Buckley (Eight is Enough) portrays a mother (of course).
Annabeth Gish is a young Mrs. Earp.
This is a good explanation of why WYATT EARP stuck to his guns (pun indeed) the way he did.
WYATT EARP in Widescreen is a very good 3 hour informative watch.

617996,4,6303269826,"For some odd reason Ive rekindled my affection for Wyatt Earp, best known as the gun slinging marshal of Tombstone, AZ who shot it out with Ike Clantons cowboy gang.  I recently watched John Sturgess Hour of the Gun which was a follow up to his Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.  Hour of the Gun fairly follows the documented acts of the gunfight and its aftermath, but still bends history.  So after watching a PBS documentary on the man, I decided to watch this 3 hour and 11 minute epic directed and co-written by Lawrence Kasdan (The Big Chill).  I hadnt seen the movie since the mid 90s but I recall it covered more of Earps life than just a 30-second gunfight in 1881.  The 3 hour length didn't bother me much as I was actually looking for more depth to his life.

The film begins with Wyatt (Ian Bohen), a teenager trying to sneak off to join the War Between the States as had his older brothers, James (David Andrews) and Virgil (Michael Madsen).  His father, Nicholas (Gene Hackman) puts a stop to it.  The family, living in Missouri decides to move to California after the war, where there is more opportunity, especially in real estate.  Some of the children decide to stay in Missouri, but Wyatt heads west and gets his first taste of the vast frontier.  He eventually returns to Missouri and marries his long-time sweetheart, Urilla Sutherland (Annabeth Gish).  She quickly becomes pregnant and just as quickly dies from Typhoid Fever, sending Wyatt (Kevin Costner) into an alcoholic state of deep depression.  He destroys everything he had and heads to Arkansas.

There he mugs a stranger and steals his horse, a death sentence in those days.  Before hes tried, Nicholas somehow (no planes, trains or automobiles) gets from California to Arkansas fast enough to bail him out and he escapes to Dodge City, Kansas.  After various gigs including a stage coach driver, saloon keeper, bouncer, miner, buffalo hunter and boxing referee, Wyatt tries his hand at law enforcement.  He eventually meets the Masterson brothers, Ed (Bill Pullman) and Bat (Tom Sizemore), who help bring peace to the booming cattle town.

But Wyatt is antsy and wants to go further west.  There is a burgeoning silver mining opportunity in Tombstone, Arizona.  Wyatt along with James, Virgil and Morgan (Linden Ashby) decide to head there, later joined by Doc Holliday (terrific Dennis Quaid) who Wyatt had help out of a problem back in Dodge City.  Doc is accompanied by his whore/girlfriend, Big Nose Kate (Isabella Rossellini, poorly cast).

One of the things I like about the movie is the grand scope from the very beginning.  While the film may not have reached the great epics in overall quality, the visuals are awe inspiring as is the excellent score by James Newton Howard.

History is somewhat vague about the Earps first encounter with Ike Clanton (Jeff Fahey) and the rest of his gang.  They were a rowdy bunch of cowpunchers and cattle rustlers and the Earp brothers had various law enforcement credentials in Tombstone including marshal and policemen.  They had constant run-ins with the county sheriff, Johnny Behan (Mark Harmon), who was sympathetic to the boisterous cowboys.  Guns weren't allowed inside the city limits and this was a constant problem which eventually led to the disagreement between Clanton, his brother Billy (Gabriel Folse), the McLaury brothers (Rex Linn and Adam Baldwin) and the rest of the gang.  The gunfight itself was not at the O.K. Corral but in front of it on the main drag.  It wasn't a 10 minute hide-and-seek shoot out portrayed in the 57 John Sturges film or even in his 67 follow-up where the shooting occurs some 30 or 40 feet apart.  It was Wyatt, Virgil, Morgan and Doc just a few feet from their adversaries.  Billy Clanton and the McLaurys were killed.  The rest of the gang took off.  Virgil, Morgan and Doc were wounded.  Wyatt wasnt.  In fact, Wyatt was never wounded by a bullet in his entire 80-year life!  So authenticity is properly shown in this film.  As is the aftermath.

The Earps and Doc were initially arrested for murder but the charges were dismissed.  The Clanton gang promised revenge, eventually seriously wounding Virgil and killing Morgan whose last words to Wyatt were, Kill them all.  With the wounded Earps and their wives, played by Catherine OHara, JoeBeth Williams, Alison Elliot, on a train headed to California, Wyatt and Doc plot out a mission to track down and kill each member of the gang.  Wyatts live-in and former prostitute, Mattie Blaylock (Mare Winningham) stays behind only to be shunned by Wyatt in favor of entertainer Josie Marcus (Joanna Going), who he eventually marries.

In almost every film version of this period of Wyatts life he kills Ike Clanton.  This film shows him and Doc killing several men in the gang but not Ike, who was actually killed years later by a police detective in Arizona.  This film is long, complicated and covers a lot of territory which is probably why it wasn't more successful.  For me it is the best film of the life of Wyatt Earp.  It shows his determination and his ability to bridge an important period in the growth of America.  The last scene is of an aging Wyatt and Josie on a boat to Alaska to get in on the gold rush.  I like the movie a lot.",1478476800,,5264,4.734065934065934

618149,4,6303269826,"This is a GREAT interpretation of the Wyatt Earp legend, more historically accurate than some of my other favorites, such as Tombstone, but because of it's more accurate account of the historic Wyatt Earp, it is one of my personal two favorite tellings of the story.  First off, why 4 stars?  The movie is long, and it's debatable whether they should have added in all the earlier parts of Wyatt's life (and just as importantly, are those earlier parts historically accurate?).  But, those earlier parts of the story, Wyatt losing his first wife and it having a devastating effect on him, was in truth instrumental in forming the fearless peace officer who became the Legend.  I also like the fact that it showed Wyatt's formative days making a living shooting buffalo and working on stage coach lines.  The real Wyatt Earp was such a multifaceted person, working many jobs, not just as a law man.  But what is also an important part of this telling is you notice in the movie that Wyatt only drinks coffee, never alcohol.  This was one of the notable quirks of the badass lawman Wyatt Earp, who according to one of his best biographies Stuart N. Lake, he was noted as never drinking alcohol or cursing, which made him an oddity in the land of hard drinking and hard fighting cowboys.

Some of my close friends have criticized Kevin Costner's performance as wooden, and poorly acted.  Personally, I liked the interpretation of Wyatt being someone who was not a smooth talking people, at times very hard, person while still having a very approachable human side for family and friends, since Wyatt Earp was known for his fierce loyalty to family and for standing for what was right.  I also think Kevin Costner did a great job showing the badass gunfighter side of arguably the greatest gunfighter and lawman in the west.  You always have to wonder what it would take to have the incredible cold nerves of someone who could tame some of the bloodiest and toughest cowboy towns in the West.  And that is where I really like Costner's interpretation.  Of course Tombstone, with Kurt Russell, is my all time favorite version of Wyatt, but because Tombstone has some glaring inaccuracies about the historical Wyatt, namely that he was ""afraid"" of facing down certain gunmen and consequently had to let Doc Holliday deal with worst gunman, is complete BS.  According to biographer Stuart Lake, who personally interviewed not only Wyatt himself, but also interviewed many of his deputies and even some of the outlaws Wyatt dealt with, Lake says that Wyatt was described as the most fearless gunfighter in west, and was also faster on the draw than any gunfighter ever witnessed by his deputy Bat Masterson.

All of this being said, I think Wyatt Earp with Kevin Costner, alongside Tombstone with Kurt Russell, are the two classics and pure fun movies when it comes to trying to capture the Legend of Wyatt Earp.  And this particular movie, because it is more historically accurate in terms of Wyatt's character, puts it right alongside of the very best movies on this great character.  It's biggest downfall is only the length of the movie, which definitely could have been shortened, and so I have to give it four stars, since that is a glaring editing issues with the movie.",1476489600,12,3269,4.7779751332149205

618292,1,6303269826,"There are a number of good movies about Wyatt Earp including The Gunfight at OK Corral, Hour of the Gun, and Tombstone.  This isn't a good film but it's probably the most exhaustive.  Wyatt Earp was originally intended as two separate movies to be released 6 months apart but after the first film bombed at the box office a new version was edited for home video that included footage intended for the second film.

Writer/director Lawrence Kasdan is trying for an epic masterpiece here but what he comes up with is seemingly endless and tedious.  Wyatt Earp almost makes Heaven's Gate look focused and exciting by comparison.

Kevin Costner is flat in the title role, exhibiting stoicism but little else.  Dennis Quaid is miscast as Doc Holiday and brings none of the charisma or sense of playfulness and tragedy that Val Kilmer brought to the same role in Tombstone, which was released around the same time.  He does look appropriately emaciated but that's about as far as his performance goes.

This film certainly has its admirers and you have to give Lawrence Kasdan credit for ambition, but he isn't really a great enough talent to pull this off.  The significantly less ambitious Tombstone is also about ten times more entertaining.  Lawrence Kasden previously made another western, Silverado, which was far from great but at least managed to occasionally entertain.  Wyatt Earp wants desperately to be epic, beginning pointlessly with the title character as a teen long before he was of any interest.  It takes over two hours just to get to the famous gunfight at the OK Corral, which is pretty well-staged but too little too late, after which Wyatt Earp becomes talky and dull again.

Someone with a great love of westerns might be happy spending 190 minutes watching this thing but Tombstone packs a whole lot more entertainment and action into a movie that's a full hour shorter.  I'll stick with Tombstone and The Gunfight at the OK Corral but if the lengthy Wyatt Earp is your cup of tea, you are welcome to it.",1473897600,,2023,4.792507204610951

Kevin Costner plays the western lawman Wyatt Earp. I thought he did a great job as well as Dennis Quaid playing the part of ""Doc"" Holliday.
Gene Hackman plays the part of Wyatt's father.
The movie is entertainment and is not historically accurate. Most movies made about icons or characters of the past are not ""historically accurate"" unless they say so. I still enjoyed it. This Blu-ray edition has some decent features on it as well as the movie itself.
~ Special Features are:
** ""Lifted Scenes""
** Documentary ""It Happened That Way"" (Very good)
** Vintage TV Special ""Walk With A Legend""
** Theatrical Trailer

618989,3,6303269826,"After seeing John Ford's ""My Darling Clementine"" (1947), I decided to see the three following ""OK Corral"" movies in chronological order.  The next two were ""Gunfight at the OK Corral"" (1957, with Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas) and ""Tombstone"" (1993, with Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer), with ""Wyatt Earp"" coming a year later, in 1994.  I'm sorry to say that at 3+hours ""Wyatt Earp"" is the least satisfying of the four.  It's ponderous, a bit disjointed, and, finally, repetitive, for all the decent cast and the nice photography.  The whole second half of the movie, it seems, is just a matter of the Earp brothers moving from place to place, ending up as lawmen wherever thy go, while their wives constantly object to the upheavals.  There are gunfights in different locales, but we never get much sense of the people that the Earps are fighting (the Clantons et. al.) as characters, and in fact, with the exception of Wyatt, we don't get very strong senses of the Earp brothers either.  They seem pretty much interchangeable after a while.  The fault in these cases of underdeveloped characterization has to lie with the writers.  They don't do much with Wyatt's love Josie Marcus either -- in ""Tombstone,"" Dana Delaney was a much more vivid presence than Joanna Goings.  In fact, the memorable characters here are those we see least of -- Isabella Rossellini as Big Nose Kate, Bill Pullman as Ed Masterson, Mark Harmon as Sheriff Behan -- and that's partly because we get to know Wyatt relatively early -- after his recovery from his wife's death, he doesn't change much at all and he isn't all that interestingly characterized to begin with.

There is Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday to give the movie a lift.  Doc is fatally consumptive and has no illusions about his future.  It's not altogether clear why he befriends Wyatt, but he sticks by him to the end.  Quaid's Doc is a kind of blend of Val Kilmer's dandyism and Kirk Douglas'svolatility and fatalism, and he makes it work.  He's less outlandishly effete than Kilmer, but he is given a curious formality of speech that marks him.  In all four movies, the Holliday figure is strongly cast, and in the last two perhaps steals the show -- as, I think, Victor Mature did in ""My Darling Clementine.""  I have to say that I didn't like the focus on Wyatt's early years -- that part of the movie seems to exist only to let Gene Hackman, as the Earp brothers' father, make rather stilted speeches that are, in effect, thematic markers -- he talks about ""blood"" (i. e. family) and ""the law"" as being all-important, and he declares that the Earps are temperamentally itinerant.  And, of course, that's what the movie delivers on, rather predictably.  I'm not sure we needed Gene Hackman to spell all that out for us: just tell the story and SHOW us the Earps in action!  We, the audience, will get the point.

What about Wyatt'scharacter?  I wondered, on reflection, if Kasdan, the director, and Costner didn't model him to some extent on John Wayne's obsessives in ""The Searchers"" and ""Red River"".  He's single minded and stubborn -- but we don't need the better part of three hours to see that, especially when the dialogue isn't all that strong.  While on the trail of influences, I came to wonder if the ending might recall the ending of ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,"" for the question arrives, for Earp, later in life, if he really did all the things attributed to him.  Viewers can decide that one for themselves.",1447632000,,3473,4.702479338842975

619159,5,6303269826,"Wyatt Warp is probably the best known as well as the most complicated character of the West from the end of the Civil War to the time of his death .Along with Wyatt,Doc Holliday is just as well known and as complicated. It is impossible to tell the story of the Shootout at the O.K. Corral without delving into the character of both of these individuals. Not only on the day of the shootout ,but also the years before, as well as the afteryears, until their deaths. So much has been portrayed about these people,and by so many different writers,movie producers,historians,reseachers,,etcand .with so much fact,fiction and legend involved ;that an almost infinite amount of time can easily be spent sorting everything out.
 This particular movie does an excellent job of it all and the performances of the actors is also excellent. Whether each and every point is totally accurate is somewhat beyond the point;it is very enjoyable and the basic story is all there,and easy to understand and follow.
 My favorites about Wyatt Earp ,Doc Holliday and the O.K. Corral are;

Tombstone  movie starring Kurt Russell,Val Kilmer
Wyatt Earp  movie starring Kevin Costner,Dennis Quaid,Gene Hackman
The Sheriff of Tombstone  movie
 Doc  book by Mary Doria Russell
 Epitaph  book by Mary Doria Russell
Doc Holliday's  Woman  book by Jane Candia Coleman
 Doc Holliday ---A Family Portrait  book by Karen Tanner & Robert Dearmont

619380,4,6303269826,"It is too bad that Tombstone and Wyatt Earp came out so close together.  Tombstone was good Hollywood entertainment and stole the show.  It made Wyatt Earp seem slow and it's character development, especially the Cowboys, made Wyatt Earp seem dry.  Actually there was more accuracy in Wyatt Earp although still Hollywood.  They brought out the other two brothers James and Warren who are primarily overlooked in other Earp movies.  Wyatt Earp is still entertaining and they give you a glimpse of Wyatt's early life while leading up to the gunfight at the OK Corral which of course is the cornerstone of most Earp movies.  Both movies showed you the hard side of Wyatt when he went for revenge over Morgan's death and Virgil's shooting, but perhaps it was James Garner in Hour Of The Gun that really captured the dark side of him.  Wyatt Earp was entertaining and well worth a watch. After the long movie, the finale seemed pushed and I wish they would have developed the villains better.",1422921600,,987,4.7368421052631575

619637,4,6303269826,"This movie is just over three hours.  I feel that should be said first.  If you plan to watch this, you might want to set aside a nice, long Sunday afternoon for it.  If you're a fan of Westerns or of history, you will probably enjoy this film, but the length is a factor.  It is, in fact, too long in my opinion.  It surely could have been edited more tightly for the sake of holding the interest of the viewer.  Having said all of that, though, I still have to say it's a good movie.

Wyatt Earp begins when the title character is a teenager wanting to enlist in the Civil War.  For him, however, it is too late.  The war ends, and his two older brothers return from the fighting.  This Missouri family is then led by their roving lawyer father to move yet again, this time out West.  The film follows young Wyatt as he grows up, moves around, and finds his niche as a lawman who doesn't always play nice.  I like that the film does go farther than most, ending some time after the famous OK Corral shootout, where typical movies end.  I felt this helped me to understand the entire situation much better, and for this, I forgive the film for being too long.",1417392000,,1160,4.218181818181818

The movie makes Wyatt look like a terrible person who treats his family and friends like dirt.  This doesn't make any sense because he is courageous enough to risk his life as a lawman to keep other people safe, but then in his personal life, turns around and becomes a person who treats others with disdain.

Love, passion, grit, fortitude and plenty of bullets flying around especially at the infamous O.K. Corral shoot out, provide the viewing audience with accurate American history, adventure, drama, morals, principles, scruples, family values and priorities along with a candid portrayal of a just Lawman, who really cared and wanted to make a difference. By daring to establish, consistent law and order in a primarily uncharted, western terrain. Legendary Lawman 'WYATT EARP' is an epic movie that you will enjoy and learn, from.

619854,5,6303269826,"Another Wyatt Earp saga, but a longer one than usual. As always, the Doc Holliday figure has
the most interesting lines--it's Dennis Quaid this time, so slim that various characters comment
on it--but the entire film is engrossing. The wives of th4 Earp brothers never get how close
they are and how oathed they are to law enforcement, but that always happens. Women just don't
get men. It's a very absorbing story, though it leaves an important piece in mystery. The
Clanton gang, so vicious and destructive, are never vanquished in any real sense. Yet a final
wordover on screen says their members died mysteriously. Yeah, but died how? Did Kevin
Costner kill them?",1405814400,,667,4.859649122807017

Althought I did enjoy ""Tombstone"" with Russell, I think time will be kinder to Costner's film.  This film is more of a biographical drama about the famed lawman's life.  What I liked about this film was that it didn't shirk from showing how Earp was a complex, flawed man and Costner commits with one of his finest performances along with Quaid matching him as the alcoholic Doc Halliday.

619972,4,6303269826,"A true story mind you. So it has to be good. It is well filmed, well presented, suspenseful enough. But the general frame of the western and life on the frontier is not disrupted in any way by any unforeseeable element. A few original points yet.

To become the sheriff of a city like Tombstone, or any other of the type, is banal for a horse thief who is running away from justice and the recollection of his first wife who died of diphtheria when pregnant. One deserves a second chance.

To have two brothers as his deputies is a lot more original.

To get into a rivalry with a gang of bad boys is also banal. But to get through without one wound of any sort while one of his brothers is killed and the other one nearly loses his right arm and will be handicapped if not crippled all his life, is rather more interesting.

Then to swear vengeance and to just go away and make sure the gang is destroyed one at a time after the first confrontation that killed a few is banal, but to be married happily on the west coast and to be seen last going to Alaska to take part in a gold rush while the gang members are getting killed is probably less common place.

What's left at the end? The vision of an original character, of a man of honor in a situation where honor is rather cheap, of a judge who is honest and of a county sheriff or marshal who is crooked, of a second ""wife"" who is more a fair arrangement to be able to go incognito in the Far West, for both the man and the woman, and finally of the third and last wife who is brought into this western situation as a potential shady lady by a dishonorable male character.

What's the most important element is the fact that the three brothers are like one and for them family, and in fact blood is everything that counts, and we could add friendship between a couple of men that makes them absolutely loyal to each other. That's probably what Walt Whitman called the ""manly love of comrades.""

Entertaining though slightly long, but a decent intensity all along.

Unlike (Dances with Wolves) which was a story set during known historical events and told in a fresh way, Wyatt Earp is a retelling of a story most of us know or think we know.

Good cast and authentic settings make for a nice look.  It may be an accurate biography but not the most interesting.  The section when he was a buffalo hunter may be historically correct but unnecessarily long as were a few other segments.

I later read that this movie was originally being directed by Ridley Scott and he had a great script. Unfortunately, Kevin Costner didn't like it and had Scott and the writer fired. I guess you can do that when (at the time) Costner was a big star. Bringing in Costner's choice for director and re-writing the script constantly, they took any charm out of the movie it could have had, and turned it into a bad formula movie.

Maybe they should have read a few Louis L'Amour novels before the production. I would have given it 3 1/2 stars but no designation. I wish Amazon would use a 10 star rating chart.

620535,3,6303269826,"All of my many reviews focus solely upon the actual quality of the film's transfer from Standard Def DVD  to the higher standard set for Blu Ray. Summaries of the plot and opinions of the story line and acting can be found in the majority of the other reviews so I do not want to be redundant.  The film's historical accuracy has been subject to debate, but then so was the accuracy of the much superior film 'Tombstone' with Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer.

Keep in mind, however, that the quality of what you see and hear is also dependent upon the quality of the TV monitor you are watching on as well as the home theater set up you are using. The monitor I use is a fairly new Panasonic ZT 65"" plasma and the amps, speakers, cables, BluRay player and Surround Processor I use are hi end esoteric gear to provide me with a more realistic and objective perspective.

VIDEO QUALITY.....
  The video for the 192 minute version of Wyatt Earp on Blu Ray (this is not the extended version I have been told is available on the Standard Def DVD) is one of the more uneven Blu Rays I have ever seen in terms of imaging quality.  Most of the day time scenes have fairly decent and natural color grading and contrast and yet other day scenes display a smoothing of details and various degrees of deep blacks. Some scenes show blacks that are impressive but most of the time the blacks often take upon a grayish color grading.  Night time scenes have an unnatural, overly cool blue color grading with a significant loss of detail where there needn't be.  It is somewhat unusual to see such unevenness and lack of consistency in a Blu Ray's imaging.  I noticed no dropouts or disturbing artifacts for this disc but it was quite clear to me that there was no remastering for Blu Ray either; it was simply re-encoded to Blu Ray with an Mbps average rate in the high teens.  While the video is very watchable, its variability in blacks, details and skin tones was completely noticeable.

AUDIO QUALITY....
  A Blu Ray DVD with a lossy Dolby Digital 5.1 audio is almost unheard of for Blu Rays.  The only other one that comes to mind is
'Goodfellas' and, for both, it is criminal.  You are paying for the highest quality and not getting it.  While the lossy audio codec being used is perfectly listenable, we would have gotten much more for our home theaters systems with a lossless audio codec.  That said, the dialogue was easy to discern with volume levels quite consistent.  During the first 70 minutes of the film the front audio stage, while mostly steered through the center channel, still had some nice panning and foley fx to the right and left surrounds as well as some discreet foley fx that were nicely separated.  The rear surrounds and LFE channel were not used at all that I could hear.  Actually it almost made me jump when, finally, a foley came through the rears almost half way through the film.  During the second half of the movie there were a few more uses of the rear surrounds and a lightning storm woke up the sub channel producing good but not very deep bottom end.  The music score provided a wide stereo image across the front audio stage but, to my mind, sometimes overshadowed and stepped upon what should have been discreet foley audio fx.

EXTRAS.....
  There were a great many deleted scenes that probably were included in the extended version.  In addition to the typical movie trailer, there was also a documentary 'Making of' that I didn't particularly find very interesting. I have read a great deal about the Earp family and the history behind the Earp legend and a historical featurette on this would have been welcome.

To be honest, I am glad I only paid $7.99 for this Blu Ray as it clearly was not properly prepared for its blu ray transfer.
I do hope that this review, which focused solely upon the quality of the actual transfer to Blu Ray has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase. All of my reviews are of this nature and I hope they can be of HELP to you as well.

621097,4,6303269826,"""Wyatt Earp"" apparently intended to be the definitive Wyatt Earp movie in terms of it's historical accuracy, etc.  On that score it probably succeeds quite well and there is much to admire in that effort.  On the other hand, the slavish devotion to this effort introduces a LOT of extraneous detail that does not make for a great movie.  Simply put, there is a whole lotta fat that could have been trimmed from this version of Wyatt Earp.  The historical trivia and detail often serves little more than to slow an otherwise very good Western down to a tedious crawl.

That being said, the cinematography, acting, etc is generally first rate throughout with Randy Quaid's performance as Doc Holliday being the stand-out.  Val Kilmer's interpretation of Doc in Tombstone was also that films stand-out performance as well.  Overall, I enjoyed Tombstone much more than Wyatt Earp in spite of the fact that Tombstone wandered far afield in terms of historical accuracy.  Tombstone was simply a better piece of entertainment; it was far more intense and interesting.  In spite of that, Wyatt Earp still manages to stand on it's own as one of the better westerns ever made.  Outside of being overly long, it is an extremely well done and mostly enjoyable film.  Those who have thrown it on the trash heap because of it's obvious flaws are, in my opinion, overlooking it's many virtues which, in my opinion, far outweigh those flaws.",1388275200,,1425,4.847107438016529

621670,4,6303269826,"My girlfriend and I made a road trip to Tombstone, Arizona on September 20-22, 2013, so we immersed ourselves in the history and legend of Wyatt Earp and the whole saga of the Old West.  As Hollywood movies go, this one is pretty accurate, although there are a few instances of artistic license.  For example, both this movie and ""Tombstone"" get the shootings of Virgil and Morgan Earp wrong (they were shot months apart although both movies show them being ambushed the same night).

Comparisons to ""Tombstone"" are inevitable.  Which movie is better?  Apples and oranges to a certain extent.  ""Tombstone"" is paced to be more of a ""popcorn"" movie.  ""Wyatt Earp"" is presented more as a historical epic.  I enjoyed both movies.  ""Wyatt Earp"" spends less time on the Tombstone Arizona aspect of Wyatt Earp's life since it's supposed to span his whole career.  One nitpick:  Costner wears a ""Gus"" type cowboy hat throught much of ""Wyatt Earp"".  I wish the filmakers had stuck to the stereotype of the black ""Boss of the Plains"" hat for Costner's movie Earp (as they did for Kurt Russell in the movie ""Tombstone"").

In summary, if you prefer a ""fun"" movie to pass an evening with, then watch ""Tombstone"".  If you prefer a more serious presentation of a historical epic, then watch ""Wyatt Earp.""",1382313600,,1289,4.773755656108597

Dennis Quaid went on a starvation diet prior to his Doc Holliday portrayal-- a highlight of this picture. Third-billed Gene Hackman as Wyatt's dad has a necessarily small role. Not one of Kevin Costner's better acting efforts. I've seen this one a few times and always come away from it with a feeling that something's missing. It's doubtful that elusive element would've been present had this been a six-hour TV miniseries, as originally planned.

That said, if you enjoy 'Heat', with both it's thorough character development and the collision of all those developed characters, you'll enjoy many of the same elements in 'Wyatt Earp'. The movie has a great cast, and to be honest, I prefer Dennis Quaid's version of Doc Holliday to that of Val Kilmer's. Dennis Quaid's version seems to be more correctly rough around the edges, what you'd expect from a character that's supposed to have a dubious past. I haven't read up much on the history that most westerns are based on, so I'm not going to say the movie is historically accurate, but the story feels like it all goes together to make a well told story.

621843,5,6303269826,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some brief thoughts on Wyatt Earp...

Wyatt Earp (1994) is a Western that stars Kevin Costner and always gets compared to Tombstone (1993).  Kevin Costner was supposed to be involved in Tombstone, but ended up not being involved due to creative differences, basically.  He then set out to make his own Wyatt Earp-based movie.  Tombstone came out six months before Wyatt Earp.  As a result, by the time Wyatt Earp was released in theaters, audiences didn't really want to see a movie with basically the same story as Tombstone, so Wyatt Earp tanked at the box office.  While Tombstone is a little over two hours long, Wyatt Earp is over three hours long.  A typical Costner movie - looooonnnnnggggg.  This, however, doesn't detract from the movie necessarily.  The pacing is well done.  The movie has some boring parts for the first 30-45 minutes, but the action does pick up later on in the movie.  While Tombstone is arguably more entertaining and Hollywood-esque, Wyatt Earp is more serious and darker all around, yet still holds my interest.  Wyatt Earp focuses on the life story of Wyatt Earp from the beginning, whereas Tombstone does not.  Dennis Quaid plays the role of Doc Holliday in Wyatt Earp in a gritty, serious way and does a great job.  Val Kilmer plays Holliday in Tombstone and also does a great job, but his take was lighter and more humorous.  I like both interpretations.  Kevin Costner plays the Wyatt Earp role, while Kurt Russell plays the role in Tombstone.  Both actors did a great job.  Gene Hackman has a role in Wyatt Earp as well and does a great job.

What it all comes down to is personal taste.  I reviewed Tombstone and gave it 5 stars.  Here I'm reviewing Wyatt Earp and giving it 5 stars as well.  Two movies that are different from one another.  If I'm in the mood for a certain version of the Wyatt Earp/Doc Holliday story, I'll just watch the movie I'm in the mood for.  Both are great movies.

The strengths of Wyatt Earp are the beautiful scenery, the musical score, the quality of the acting, the action sequences, the epic feel to it, and the overall cinematography.

Wyatt Earp is one of those movies that got buried at the box office when it was released but has gained in stature and is much more appreciated with the passage of time.  In my opinion, this is a criminally underrated movie.

I highly recommend Wyatt Earp.",1365811200,,2429,4.622950819672131

The full, uncut version of this film is far better, but was made available only on VHS and LaserDisc (both widescreen).  I assumed that the theatrical version DVD would eventually be followed by a Blu-Ray that contained the uncut version - especially now that branching technology would probably make it possible for both versions to be on one disc.  Even if that were not the case, it should have been either a single disc of the uncut (we already have the cut DVD), or, better, a two-disc set with both versions.  The extra cost to the studio would be minimal.  As it is, yet another chance to spend your money on a butchered version of a film you'd enjoy and appreciate better in its full form.  Sadly, this is never likely to get the Criterion treatment, and be released as it should be seen (as ""Heaven's Gate was earlier this year).

Some people will say the uncut version is too long, but anyone who can sit through, and enjoy, the 190 minutes of this version would not be disappointed to spend 212 minutes on the better cut.

I think it sets a high standard for accuracy in depicting our Western heroes in general and Wyatt Earp and his brothers and associates in particular.  Period detail is indeed detailed, and the dialog and action are clearly communicated.  Never a dull moment.  I am not bothered by the length of this movie in the least.

The casting was certainly inspired.  Examples can include the overly-thin (and aged before his time) Doc Holliday, the increasingly chubby Bat Masterson, and the resemblance among the Earp family.

Those involved in the screenwriting did their homework, and it was good to see in the credits something to the effect that (only) some of it was fictionalized.  Comparing the movie to the novel ""Doc"" (by Mary Doria Russell) shows some agreement of independant research; examples include the Masterson brothers working for Wyatt as buffalo skinners, the ""arrangement"" between James Earp and his prostitute wife, and the occasion of the first meeting of Wyatt and Doc Holliday.  Of course there are discrepencies with the historical record.  The shooting of the two Earp brothers and the two train rides out of Tombstone are conflated to the same time period, but this really makes no difference to the gist of the story and the significance of the events.  In his old age at the end of the movie, Wyatt is aware of the liberties being taken in the making of his legend and apparently doesn't feel too bad about that.",1347235200,2,1504,4.8359375

Dennis Quaid went on a starvation diet prior to his Doc Holliday portrayal-- a highlight of this picture. Third-billed Gene Hackman as Wyatt's dad has a necessarily small role. Not one of Kevin Costner's better acting efforts. I've seen this one a few times and always come away from it with a feeling that something's missing. It's doubtful that elusive element would've been present had this been a six-hour TV miniseries, as originally planned.

622147,5,6303269826,"I used to love western movies in my earlier days, and they were so much more abundant. I guess they must have been the action movies of old times. In any case, I picked up a ""Wyatt Earp"" DVD from a Ross bargain rack and watched it last night. The movie was exceptionally well done but I wouldn't exactly think of it as an action movie. In fact, it seemed extremely long and drawn out with a fairly slow pace. Interesting and well done as it was, I began to fatigue a bit. Then the movie stopped and a little note appeared to go to Disc 2. Groan. What can I say? This is an interesting movie, without question, but it just exceeds my ability to concentrate, especially late at night when I'm watching it.

The movie is centered about the legendary Sheriff Wyatt Earp, together with Batt Masterson and Doc Holiday, and the exploits in Dodge City Kansas and Tombstone, Arizona. I expect that the depictions are much more realistic than most of the westerns I've watched, but I really have no way of knowing. The acting was quite good but seemed a bit stiff and formalized as in a lot of British depictions of more ancient times. There was a certain amount of blood and gore, but it was done in good taste, if that designation might be applied, and fit the context of a western movie. There was a certain amount of foul language, but it was fitting and appropriate to the scene, not like an overwhelming amount of F-speak found in a lot of modern movies. The sets, scenery and filming of such was excellent. The sound was quite good, much better than most modern surround-sound movies. The movie was an extremely interesting historical depiction. All in all, it was a very worth-while movie but if you attempt to watch it, leave a lot of time. I'm thinking of it as a 4 1/2-star movie, becaus of the excessive length, but I can easily upgrade it to a five.

622151,2,6303269826,"After reading the wonderful book ""Doc"" for book club, my husband and I watched ""Tombstone"" a few days ago, and ""Wyatt Earp"" last night, in preparation for next week's book club meeting. To all those who say there is some controversy about which movie is better, I can put the controversy to rest: ""Tombstone"" is better.

Watching ""Wyatt Earp"" felt like watching creaky community theater (no offense to community theater) from the opening scenes with Wyatt (Kevin Costner, with his trademark anachronistic shag/mullet hairdo) drinking a cup of coffee that is steaming like a witch's cauldron, as if the stagehands just put a lump of dry ice in the cup. With the exception of the fine Gene Hackman as the Earp father, the male leads' acting is either goofy cartoonish, or melodramatic, or wooden, or amazingly, all three at the same time. Having just watched Kurt Russell's tightly controlled and uber-masculine portrayal of Wyatt Earp in ""Tombstone,"" Kevin Costner's take on the same character reminded me a little of Forrest Gump, no offense to Forrest Gump, crossed with Costner's character from ""Dances With Wolves"" (same hairdo).

I love Dennis Quaid, but having watched Val Kilmer's definitive portrayal of Doc Holliday in ""Tombstone"" just a few days before seeing Quaid's version in ""Wyatt Earp"" was probably completely unfair to Dennis Quaid and his cool little sunglasses, who just didn't even come close for me.

I LOVE Westerns, but this cliche ridden movie--tight shot of bottle right before a bullet explodes it, anyone?--made me roll my eyes. To sweeten the deal, it is over three hours long!

Recommendation: Watch ""Tombstone"" instead.",1330214400,8,1648,5.115241635687732
622152,5,6303269826,"Achtung: zweiseitige DVD 9 - nicht zu empfehlen, aber, dafr eben auch ...

 ... die - eindeutig !? - ""bessere"" Darstellung der realen (Film) ""Geschichte"".

Dabei, allerdings mit einigen (wenigen) Einschrnkungen, was aber nicht den Film selbst bzw. die eigentliche Haupthandlung betrifft, sondern diese seltsame DVD - Spezifikation.

Wer hatte den hier unter den Lizenz - Inhabern die grandiose Idee, ausgerechnet dieses Meisterwerk auf eine DVD 9, oder anders gesagt, - zweiseitige Dual Layer Rohling (wenn schon aufstehen und wechseln mitten im Film, dann doch wenigstens mit mehreren, seperaten Scheiben wie z. B. bei der Extended Version von ""Herr der Ringe"" usw. usf.) zu pressen !?

Womit Fingerabdrcke oder (im Fall von ausleihen / verborgen) gleich noch ""vorzeitig fehlerhaft abspielbare"" Beschdigungen unweigerlich auftreten knnen, oder ist das etwa bereits so (ein)kalkuliert worden !?

Ansonsten ist diese ""Version"" hier mit Produzent/Darsteller Kevin Costner - verglichen jedenfalls zu der ""Tobstone - Fassung"" mit Kurt Russell - 100 x besser.

Allerdings vorwiegend, weil hier bedeutend ausfhrlicher auf die historischen Gegebenheiten (Earp's Werdegang, das zeigen seiner ganzen Familie usw., inclusive der aufgezeichneten, bekannten Fakten) eingegangen wird.

Und auch, weil Dennis Quaid als John ""Doc"" Holliday - Darsteller auch ""realistischer"" sowie glaubhafter ""ankommt"" als ein - damals - noch jngerer (und somit auch im Film dann bertrieben jugendlich wirkender) Val Kilmer.

Solche historischen (oder auch nur komplett rein fiktive) Personen darzustellen, ist ja sowieso immer extrem schwierig fr jeden Schauspieler und bisher auch nur ganz wenigen - extrem glaubhaft wie berzeugend - gelungen (John Wayne bei ""the Shootist - der letzte Scharfschtze"" oder Steve McQueen bei ""ich, Tom Horn"" zum Beispiel).

Oft standen die Akteure sogar in diesen - dh. ihren letzten - Rollen selbst bereits ""mit einem Bein in Grab"". Und konnten daher meitens auch nicht Annerkennung(en) fr ihre abgelieferten Leistungen erfahren.

Somit groes Lob an den Schauspieler Dennis Quaid fr seine gezeigte Leistung. Obwohl der ""echte"" Holliday auch mit gerade einmal 36 Jahren verstarb.

Wie auch immer, - zur jedem (ja doch) dann auch noch wenigstens in groben Zgen bekannten ""Story"" bzw. der geschichtlichen Vorlage braucht bestimmt nicht viel gesagt werden.

Kann aber dennoch mal versuchen, etwas zu dieser filmischen Umsetzung hier zu schildern und hinzufgendes zu kommentieren.

Zur Handlung: Costner's ""Version"" beginnt zunchst mit der Kindheit und Darstellungen der frhen Jugendjahren von Wyatt Earp ...

 ... und lsst sich dabei auch erstmal - fast - geschlagene 1, 5 Stunden Zeit damit, bis er zu den Szenen kommt, die verglichen dazu, bei ""Tombstone"" den Anfang bildeten.

Inzwischen ""ist"" das Jahr 1881, Ort, - im Mittelwesten der USA, der frhere Glcksritter, Kopfgeldjger und Gesetzeshter Marschall Wyatt Earp kommt zunchst mit 2 Brdern und ihren beiden Frauen in die zu dieser Zeit aufblhende Stadt Tombstone (Arizona), - um sich dort endlich niederzulassen und (wie so viele andere) seinen ""amerikanischen Traum (Freiheit, Wohlstand und das Streben nach Glck) wahrzunehmen.

Und sonst auch - dh. von ihm geplant - nur noch in Ruhe abgeschieden von den aufregenden, lebensgefhrlichen Jahren davor zu leben.

- SCHNITT - hier (bzw. etwas weiter davor) mu diese DVD - Auflage dann umgedreht werden.

Edit: Nachtrag, - der Film ist auf DVD nur als zweiseitige DVD - 9 in Deutschland zu bekommen.

Etwa gleichzeitig zieht es auch seinen guten alten Bekannten, - den Spieler ,Revolverhelden und ehemaligen Zahnarzt John ""Doc"" Holliday ebenfalls in diese Gegend. In der Hoffnung (und vermutl. auf rztl. Rat ), das trockene Klima dort wrde seine ""Schwindsucht"" (Tuberkulose) etwas ertrglich fr ihn machen. Eventuell auch, mit dem baldigen Tod bereits vor Augen, um zuvor etwas schneller durch ein grandioses Duell ""berhmter"" zu sterben !?

, - Er ist jedenfalls der einzige im Film, der z. B. ganz ruhig dasitzt, wenn ""Blei fliegt"". Was dem Film zuweilen auch eine entsprechend komdiantische Note gibt. Sonst aber wirken alle Darsteller und ebenfalls die ganze Inszenierung hier bedeutend authentischer, ""ernsthafter"" und durchgehend ""bei der Sache"". Und spielen - dh. jeder fr sich - ihre Rollen auch gewohnt gut bzw. berzeugend , -

Alles weitere darauf vollzieht sich allerdings trotzdem eher nachteilig fr beide.

Und natrlich auch nur allzu vorhersehbar wie erwartungsgem, - so das sie auf Grund unglcklicher Umstnde, ihrem ""Ruf"", sowie Miverstndnissen bald mit Banden von ""Cowboys"" (dh. einer lose hirarchisch aufgebaute Organisation bzw. eine Art frhe Form des organisierten Verbrechens), - die sich untereinander mit roten Bauchschrpen kennzeichnen, spter immer weiter aneinander geraten.

Bis es dann zur bekannten Schieerei zwischen den Earp's und Holliday auf der einen und den Clanton's und Mc Laury's auf der anderen Seite kommt (das bekannte Duell am Ok Corral).

Mehr braucht wschl. - bzw. soll bis hier nicht verraten werden. Auch um jenen, die den Film noch nicht gesehen haben, nicht jeden ""Anreiz"" gleich zu schmlern. Bleibt also nur noch die Frage offen, wie dann alles filmisch umgesetzt und (verglichen zu ""schwarz - wei"" Klischee's anderer Filme dieser Art) auch ""neu"" abgedreht wurde !?

Auf jedem Fall beraus ""zutreffend"" ! Mit den blichen, opulenten Bildern und Landschaftsaufnahmen und einem dazu - nicht negativ - drhnenden Soundtrack. Auch die (dh. was den Ton betrifft) ""Effekte"" sind gelungen.

Man hrt mit der entsprechenden Dolby - Surround Anlage auch viele bis dahin ""bersehene"" Nebengerusche.

Und auch optisch - Bild - ist ebenfalls alles leicht staubig oder etwas schmuddelig (Requisiten, Hintergrnde usw.) gehalten worden.

So das es dabei nun auch fr die reinen Gelegenheitszuschauer hier wirklich mal weniger im groen und ganzen zu kritisieren gibt.

Allerdings, - werden auch hier gegen Ende (nach dem berhmt - berchtigten Duell am Ok Corrall und der darauf folgenden ""Rache des Gesetzes"" bzw. dem feigen Mord an Earp's Bruder Morgan, wodurch alles erst weiter eskaliert) der Rest, das weitere Leben der dargestellten Figuren leider ebenso nur reichlich lapidar ...

 ... wie eben z. B. ""Doc"" Holliday's Tod usw. dann lediglich mit ""Schautafeln"" bzw. in einer schnell scrollender Laufschrift abgehandelt.

Was auch die wenigen, - als Bonusmaterial beigefgten entfallenen Szenen nicht weiter ergnzen.

So das auch hier der Eindruck entsteht, das Budget wurde vorwiegend fr die horrenden Gagen der ""namenhafteren"" Darsteller verwendet, - anstatt nun wirklich auch die ""ganze"" Geschichte zu zeigen !?

Die ""Tombstone - Version"" hingegen befasst sich hier wiederum etwas nher mit diesen Details ...

 ... bleibt also nur fr die meiten Western - Fans brig, um die vollstndige Geschichte gesehen zu haben: preisgnstig beide (!) Filme seperat kaufen oder auch wenigstens auszuleihen und anzuschauen.

Bebilderten Schnittbericht bitte anschauen, interessant fr jeden, der Fan dieses Western ist und dann auch mal gerne sehen mchte, was ihm bisher alles vorenthalten wurde ...

Diese Verfilmung des ereignisreichen Lebens der Westernlegende Wyatt Earp war seinerzeit ein Wunschprojekt von Kevin Costner selbst.

Mit einem von Dan Gordon geschriebenem Script, welches fr eine sechsstndige TV - Miniserie ausgelegt war, wurde er beim spteren Regisseur Lawrence Kasdan vorstellig, mit dem er schon bei dem Western ""Silverado"" zusammengearbeitet hatte.

Der sagte unter der Bedingung zu, das Drehbuch fr einen ca. dreistndigen Kinofilm umschreiben und dabei einiges von dem Material von Gordon verwenden zu drfen. Die erste fertige Schnittfassung war rund 3 Stunden 50 Minuten lang.

Weil es aber in den 90er Jahren schwer genug war, ein geduldiges Kinopublikum fr einen Western zu finden - und, erst recht noch fr einen, in dem der ""Held"" der Geschichte nur schwer als Identifikationsfigur angesehen werden konnte - schnitt Kasdan selbst zunchst 20 Minuten an Szenenmaterial, welches in keinster Weise der Fortfhrung der Geschichte diente oder schlicht nicht gut genug war, aus dieser Fassung heraus.

Die dabei entstandene, 3, 5 stndige Version ist jene, die in der Special Expanded Edition - Laserdisc Box enthalten und Lawrence Kasdans' persnliche Wunschfassung ist.

Fr das entsprechende Kinorelease entfernte Kasdan allerdings sicherheitshalber noch ein gutes Dutzend weitere Szenen aus dieser Fassung, die er zwar gerne mit im Streifen gesehen htte, aber ebenfalls nicht zwingend fr das Verstndnis der Geschichte notwendig waren, um die Lauflnge noch ""kinotauglicher"" zu gestalten.

Diese wurde dann ihrerseits zu der heute allseits bekannten Kinofassung.",1329091200,,9324,5.511938202247191

Not only is the film rather long but you get the same acting from Kevin Costner as you got with other films that came out in the 90's with costner in them (EX. Dances with Wolves).  I did like some of Costers films but this one kinda made me mad with the poor acting and long drawn out story.

622201,4,6303269826,"In the summer of 1994, actor Kevin Costner's Western mega-epic ""Wyatt Earp"" crashed and burned at the cinema effectively halting his lengthy streak of critically-acclaimed hits dating back to ""The Untouchables"" in 1987.  At the time, the modestly-profitable rival ""Tombstone"" had effectively stolen Costner's thunder by beating him to the box office punch six months earlier and leaving his far more expensive saga as a tired retread.  Still, in its expanded version, ""Wyatt Earp"" deserves re-discovery for factors extending beyond Costner's presence alone.

I will first address director Lawrence Kasdan and producer Costner's intentions since Costner basically is the movie.  This duo evidently wanted to capture a somber Louis L'Amour-esque look on-screen (the costuming is a dead giveaway), as their tragic interpretation of Earp's life story often resembles an Old West version of ""The Godfather,"" replacing mobsters with frontier cops.  Unfortunately, with so many individuals introduced or merely name-dropped in the span of three hours, similar characters (especially rustler Curly Bill and friends) blend together far too easily making it hard to tell them apart.  If you are not already familiar with whom all these historical figures are, then good luck to those who can't recognize who's who.  The same problem extends to the desert backdrop.  As the movie was filmed on location in New Mexico, this would explain why Wichita, Dodge City, and Tombstone largely all look like the same locale.  ""Tombstone,"" on the other hand, had the advantage of one primary location, which certainly simplifies the necessary story-telling.

With a timeline spanning nearly forty years, ""Wyatt Earp"" should be commended for ambitiously giving viewers as much story as possible, but this inevitably causes obvious pacing issues.  Costner may have assumed that lightning would strike twice following the majestic 1990 ""Dances With Wolves,"" but this plodding film's ambiance (including James Newton Howard's melancholic score) is unable to successfully carry 180+ minutes without any comic relief or an exhilarating romance (although Costner and co-star Joanna Going are believable as Wyatt and the third Mrs. Earp).  The script's sometimes clunky dialogue also disguises speeches (i.e. Gene Hackman as Earp's father repeatedly spellling out the Earp family credo) and explanations of off-screen incidents as everyday dialogue, which only further muddles the slow narrative.

The film's all-star ensemble (also including Dennis Quaid, Mark Harmon, Annabeth Gish, Michael Madsen, JoBeth Williams, Tom Sizemore, Bill Pullman, among many others) is top-notch, as it should be considering the production's estimated $75 million price tag.  Specifically, I give kudos to Dennis Quaid as the film's acting MVP.  Rather than copying Val Kilmer's high-profile, flamboyantly roguish take on John ""Doc"" Holliday, Quaid's coarsely authentic approach was certainly overlooked for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nod (if not the trophy itself).  To Quaid's credit, he  not only looked the part, but he made the tubercular, decaying Holliday as unlikeable as most of his contemporaries thought he was.  Mare Winningham as Wyatt's second wife, Mattie, also merits acclaim.  Others, such as Hackman, Gish, James Gammon, and Joanna Going, in supporting roles, deserve some honorable mention as well.

As for Costner's performance, with some reservations, it is generally a positive.  Based upon the various accounts of Wyatt Earp's life that I have read, his stone-faced portrayal of Earp is virtually dead-on.  Further, I would conclude that, although Kurt Russell physically resembled the real Wyatt Earp (and, yes, was more entertaining), Costner's depth drew closer to Wyatt's cold fish personality.  Make no mistake, though: Costner's ego tends to overplay his hand, including twice where he makes short announcements to the stunned saloon crowd upon prevailing in battle.  Somehow, I don't imagine that rowdy drunkards would have been awed into silent fear by Earp's mere presence.  Also, by having other characters tell Wyatt how much better a stage driver, buffalo hunter, shooter, etc. he is than they are, it doesn't really help build a myth; rather, it becomes a bore.

The bleak, gritty realism of ""Wyatt Earp"" will appeal far more to movie-goers who enjoy historical documentaries as entertainment vs. those who prefer straight-up Hollywood historical fantasy (and, yes, ""Tombstone"" is largely a Western fantasy).  Speaking of which, it is known that Costner was originally linked to ""Tombstone,"" until he had a falling out with late writer-director Kevin Jarre over the proposed film's scope.  It helps explain the supposed bad blood between the rival productions, as Costner's ego dictated that he must pursue his own epic vision of Earp's life.  He was definitely right in providing the characters far more depth and creating a realistically somber balance.  Case in point: Costner and Kasdan accurately depict an aloof Wyatt as being despised by his sister-in-laws, as his brothers too often deferred to Wyatt's needs over their own wives.  Further, Mare Winningham's performance as Wyatt's neglected second wife, Mattie, is heartbreaking to watch as it removes even more luster from Earp's status as an Old West icon.  Except for conveniently ignoring the real Wyatt's alleged antics as a card shark and opportunistic con artist, Costner's film is and will likely remain the closest Hollywood will come to exploring Earp's legendary life story.  To its credit, the film's classy finale acknowledges that separating fact from fiction is often next to impossible, so Earp's life will always (to some degree) remain a mystery.  Still, real history alone doesn't sell movie tickets.  Despite offering a mostly outstanding Western epic for adult viewers, Costner and Kasdan underestimated the necessity of popcorn entertainment that ""Tombstone"" captured so well with mainstream audiences.

As a random thought, this epic movie still has extraordinary potential if it were cleverly re-edited, i.e. trimming much of its first third into quick-snippet flashbacks, such as Urilla's (or Irilla's) death, for a more haunting effect on Wyatt's psyche during the Tombstone years.

Rating: 8/10 (In most categories, it's a historically superior and better-acted film that ages better than ""Tombstone,"" but it sorely lacks the other film's charismatic flavor.  It really depends upon what you are looking for in a big-screen Western: gritty realism or Hollywood fantasy).

P.S.  The DVD special features are not necessarily spectacular, but they are certainly some nice, well-produced additions to check out when you have the time.  Included in the special edition are some additional scenes that pad the film's running time past 190 minutes.",1310515200,4,6818,5.504798464491363

So it does not come as a surprise that him and director Kasdan tried to tackle the story of one of the great legends of that era. Some of the (beautifully filmed) shots seem to come right out of Costner's own movie. But this film starts out with Earp's youth and takes its time getting to Dodge City, a sheriff star and Doc Holiday. The cast is excellent and full of great names, but Dennis Quaid (who hungered himself down for the Doc role) steals every scene he is in. Sadly, the film is overly long, it would have been a great 2.5 hours movie. As it is, there is still an interesting characterization of a man who became a legend without being a shiny, perfect hero. He is flawed and sometimes even unlikable, much like most of the other characters. But that gives the film a much more realistic feel than most others from the genre.

This movie came to the theaters the same time as Kurt Russell's Tombstone, and I saw both on the big screen. Russell, I felt was much better and Tombstone was clearly superior, but there was something about Costner's character development that kept me glued. It's a wonderful version of a longtime yarn and he carries off the job of recreating Wyatt Earp marvelously. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wishes to see beyond just the OK Corral gunfight, and into Earp's younger and more formative years. How Wyatt came to be Wyatt.

Maybe it's the other three hours.

Too bad Gene Hackman's role was limited, perhaps by editing. Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday really suffered for his art. He starved off 30+ lbs. to play the tubercular gunslinger. Those who like Kevin Costner (I do!) will enjoy him here. (Look close in some scenes, for that's Wyatt's actual revolver Kevin is holding. It was loaned by the Earp Museum for this film.)

622248,3,6303269826,"Yes, there are times during this marathon 3-hour biopic you the viewer are actually engaged in the story of one of the Old West's most famous lawmen, WYATT EARP; unfortunately, those times are few and far between, lodged solidly inside what can only be construed as a rambling, often incoherent, celluloid mess.  And it's a shame, because WYATT EARP offers lots of star power and Mr. Earp himself lived one most interesting life (as did his many brothers); yet again, unfortunately, the positives don't translate consistently, making this film perpetually flirt with becoming a yawn fest.

Kevin Costner is stoic in the lead role.  Nothing wrong with that; from all accounts Earp himself was one and the same.  And (by and large) I have no problems with David Andrews, Michael Madsen, and Linden Ashby as Earp brothers James, Virgil, and Morgan.  What does bug me is Gene Hackman getting top tier billing for barely being in the movie, Mark Harmon in a howler role as impotent sheriff Johnny Behan, and an emaciated Dennis Quaid belching out an uber Southern accent as pistol-wielding Doc Holliday.  The Earp wives serve nothing more than to whine and complain when Wyatt talks his brothers into a new change of scenery, and you need a scorecard to keep up with all the various Tombstone villains, who aren't vetted and run in and out of the Arizona sequences in a most confusing manner.

Despite all the flaws WYATT EARP is finely crafted, has an authentic look and feel, and you can't go totally wrong with a stunning Joanna Going (she's got me going) as Wyatt's eventual soulmate, Josephine Marcus.

622249,5,6303269826,"In 1994, ""Wyatt Earp"" was released; eventually becoming a DVD movie that tells a possibility about key parts involving a family of brothers who stood in the face of angry evil.  Kevin Costner fans will enjoy seeing him in the role of Wyatt, as Dennis Quaid portrays Doc Holliday, who joins forces with Gene Hackman as the patriarch Nicholas Earp, David Andrews as James Earp, Linden Ashby as Morgan Earp, and Michael Madsen as Virgil Earp - a combined force to be reckoned with.  Jeff Fahey portrays Ike Clanton, joined by Adam Baldwin as Tom McLaury; who merge their band of outlaws and can't seem to be slowed down - let alone stopped, until they clash with the Earp brothers in Tombstone AZ.
This story has heart, and gives a realistic sense of strong willed women (like they would have to be to be associated with the Earp brothers), who resist the stone-willed Wyatt's leadership of the Earp brothers.  Catherine O'Hara as Allie Earp (you will recognize her as the mom in the first two ""Home Alone"" films, the loopy designer mom in ""Beetle Juice,"" and several other past roles); JoBeth Williams as Bessie Earp (better known from the first two ""Poltergeist"" films in her role as Diane Freeling, also appearing in Frasier as the attractive woman named Madeline Marshall who goes with Frasier to Bora Bora for a hot time in a suite unknowingly next to his ex, several Hallmark TV movies, and several TV series); Betty Buckley as Virginia Earp (also an accomplished actress with many TV series to her credit, and a movie or two); and then there's Mare Winningham who portrays Mattie Blaylock a saloon vamp lover of Wyatt's who is hoping to become his wife, but is replaced by a younger woman love interest - Joanna Going in the role of Josie Marcus (you'll recognize Mare Winningham from the 2009 film ""Brothers"" as Elsie Cahill, and Grey's Anatomy as Susan Grey, along with many other TV series roles; and Joanna Going from the 1991 remake of ""Dark Shadows"" as Victoria Winters and other TV series roles).
Isabella Rossellini plays the role of Big Nose Kate, the consort of Doc Holliday; and Annabeth Gish as Unilla Sutherland, the poignant element of Wyatt's early life - his wife who dies of a respiratory disease after which Wyatt goes off the deep end for a while.
Have I made my point yet?  Okay let's keep going.
Tom Sizemore is in the role of Bat Masterson, Mark Harmon portrays Sheriff Johnny Behan, and Bill Pullman portrays Ed Masterson.
This is a stellar cast including Gabriel Folse as Billy Clanton and Kris Kamm as Billy Claiborne, with great scenery, easily believable costumes, and every actor / actress giving their respective role a pristine performance to make this movie unforgettable.  Of all the portrayals, perhaps the clear stand out is Dennis Quaid who somehow even looks emaciated enough (as a tuberculosis victim) to convince any theater goer that the role was custom made for him (he lost 30 lbs for his role in this film).  Most reviewers like Dennis Quaid's portrayal of Doc Holliday in ""Wyatt Earp"" better than Val Kilmer's in ""Tombstone.""  It helps if you like Kevin Costner, who is the headliner for ""Wyatt Earp"" (go figure), and he delivers his typical performance with aplomb.
Primarily focusing upon Dodge City and Tombstone, this film gives us a feeling of law and order not being all that easy to come by; except for stalwart men who were willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of justice.  In case you can't tell yet, I enjoyed this DVD movie, and am quite happy I bought it.

622283,2,6303269826,"Wyatt Earp is Kevin Costner's bio-pic answer to the film he was originally supposed to star in, Tombstone. It is said that Wyatt Earp is more documentary-like than Hollywood movie. However, at the end of the day, Wyatt Earp fails to entertain or keep the interest of its audience for it ridiculous 3-hour running time.

First off, I have to commend the film for its use of Michael Madsen, Linden Ashby & Mark Harmon in particular. All three actor, while playing smaller roles, all to very well with what they have, putting up some solid performances. The cast is littered with recognizable names, and for the most part, everybody does the best with what they got. Actors like Jeff Fahey are underused, but they're usually still solid. The same can not be said for the main characters, however. Kevin Costner is for better and for worse Kevin Costner, not really doing anything with the character apart from what's on the page, often giving a distractingly tonal difference between the two sides of Wyatt Earp. Gene Hackman phones in a performance that asks little of him than to be wise. And even though he's in the movie a grand total of five minutes, he gets 2nd or 3rd billing. As for Dennis Quaid, he gives one of the most overwrought accents in recent memory with his portrayal of Doc Holiday. Sounding like a cross between the Rooster from the Looney Tunes & Colonel Sanders, Doc Holiday is a black hole of personality thats defining characteristic seems to be his only friendship with Wyatt Earp because he has TB. On his own, Quaid's Doc Holiday isn't that interesting, but compared to Val Kilmer's classic portrayal of Holiday, there isn't even a contest. Kilmer wins by sheer default.

Then there's how to film views women. Every one of the various wives in this film is portrayed as little more than a winy shrew that will steal a gun and fire it at their man if they're the least bit angry. And they happen to be angry a lot. They get mad when Wyatt moves the family asking why 'the brothers need to stick together.' They get mad when Wyatt does what Wyatt does with the ""Cowboy"" gang. One gets mad when her husband is cheating on her even though they're not technically married. Not to mention the sheer lack of any personality found in Wyatt's other two girlfriends/lovers/wives to begin with.

Then there's the long, drawn-out story. Covering most of the highlights in Earp's life up until Tombstone, the movie has a certain fondness for dropping you in the middle of a situation where nobody seems very happy. They literally jump in time where things are supposed to be better, only to show you that things are not going better. For example, when Earp announces he's moving the family to Tombstone, literally the next scene is the wives complaining that they were moved to Tombstone and thing are the same as they always were, to which one of the brother's respond, ""It's not for lack of trying!"" Wait, how did you get here again? The movie has a fondness for doing this, leaving very little connection from scene to scene. You're left extremely confused about Earp before & after the Tombstone incident. Why is everybody mad at the guy? Why did he ""pick"" the fight anyways? In fact, general lack of cohesion makes this movie an overall frustrating watch.

Overall, with shoddy stunts, writing, story, motive, main characters, and other problems with most everything else, Wyatt Earp is a forgettable mess that's not the epic the movie is advertised as, unless they meant epically bad and uninteresting. As a stand-alone film, it doesn't work. When compared to Tombstone, it's wiped off the floor in almost every respect.",1280016000,5,3637,4.73186119873817
622284,5,6303269826,"Lawrence Kasdan's ""Wyatt Earp"" got a raw deal in 1994 when it was released; the movie ""Tombstone"" -- essentially the same story -- came out six months earlier and stole its thunder. The difference in these two films can be observed in their names: ""Tombstone"" focuses on Earp's conflict with the 'Cowboys' gang in the Arizona town, whereas ""Wyatt Earp"" is an epic Western detailing Earp's life from youth to old age, although the Tombstone events are certainly the center piece. ""Wyatt Earp"" runs 3 hours 11 minutes and ""Tombstone"" is an hour shorter. Both are top-of-the-line modern Westerns and whether you'll like one or the other depends on what you're in the mood for. If you want kinetic mythmaking ""Tombstone fills the bill, but if you want realistic storytelling with the details and mundaneness thereof then ""Wyatt Earp"" is the way to go. Regardless, both are vastly superior to the dull 1957 version with Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.""

I originally saw ""Tombstone"" sometime in the 90s, but by the time I got around to seeing ""Wyatt Earp"" I had forgotten the former film; as such, ""Tombstone"" wasn't able to 'steal the thunder' from my viewing of Costner's version. I was engrossed throughout. It may not be as great as his ""Dances with Wolves"" (1990), but it's not far off and, besides, few Westerns stand equal with that one.

I recently saw both films back-to-back and it is fun comparing the two. Val Kilmer from ""Tombstone"" wins out over Dennis Quaid as Doc Holiday, but not by much and not because Quaid is bad but rather because Holiday's role is more prominent in ""Tombstone"" with better lines. Actually Kilmer is nothing less than fascinating in the role, although Quaid is more believable. Kurt Russell and Costner are about even as Earp, but ""Tombstone"" wins out overall in cast with Sam Elliott, Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Billy Zane and the shining Dana Delany as Josie, although Joanna Going in the same role in ""Wyatt"" shines just as much. But there are several exceptions; for instance, Isabella Rossellini in ""Wyatt"" edges out Joanna Pacula as Big Nose Kate, Doc's babe.

As for the dramatic walk to the O.K. Corral and the gunfight itself I favor ""Wyatt Earp,"" but ""Tombstone"" has a better dramatic build-up to the confrontation. However, ""Tombstone"" loses too much steam after the gunfight with redundant shootouts between Wyatt & his men and the Cowboys; ""Wyatt Earp"" maintains better momentum in the final act where the train sequence is much more impressive than the quick rendition shown in ""Tombstone.""

Unlike ""Tombstone,"" which was shot in Arizona, ""Wyatt"" was shot in New Mexico, with additional scenes shot in South Dakota, Port Angeles, WA, and Burbank Studios, CA.

FINAL WORD: Don't listen to the moron critics who undeservedly bashed ""Wyatt Earp"" upon release in '94. They're wrong, pure and simple. ""Tombstone"" was evidently too fresh in their minds and ruined the story for them. ""Wyatt Earp"" easily stands with the all-time best Westerns. Just make sure you're in the mood for a 3-hour-plus epic before viewing. And, by all means, catch ""Tombstone"" too -- they're both great.

Most critics seem to think the last is the best, but I have a sneaking preference for this Kevin Costner version (he co-produced it, and buddy Lawrence Kasdan co-wrote and directed), perhaps because it's essentially a biopic: instead of concentrating, as the other three do, on the one defining incident of Earp's career, it attempts to trace the incidents that brought him there.  Much of the story is told in flashback while Wyatt prepares for his famous gunfight.  We begin in Iowa, where 15-year-old Wyatt (Ian Bohen) and his kid brothers Morgan (Scott Paul) and Warren (Oliver Hendrickson) are running the farm owned by their father, lawyer Nicholas (Gene Hackman), while their two older brothers, James (David Andrews) and Virgil (Michael Madsen) are off serving the Union in the Civil War.  (No mention is ever made of a half-brother, Newton, by Nicholas's first marriage, who also wore the blue, and a fictional sister, Lou (Alison Elliott) is added to the family, while real-life sister Adelia, born when Wyatt was 13, is renamed Martha (Mary Jo Niedzielski).)  Wyatt longs to do the same, but his father won't allow it.  After the older boys return home, Nicholas decides it's time to move on, to California; en route Wyatt sees his first shootout--and is literally sick.  Seven years later he's freighting supplies for the railroad and refereeing prizefights, in which latter capacity he is challenged to a gunfight--and wins by hurling a pool ball at his opponent.  Returning to Missouri to study law under his grandfather (Giorgio E. Tripoli), a judge, he revives a Dante-esque romance with Urilla Sutherland (Annabeth Gish), marries her, loses her to typhoid within a year, and goes on a nine-month drunk that ends when he steals a horse and is bailed out by his father.  Knowing he'll hang if he stays in the East, he goes on to buffalo hunting and meets the Masterson brothers, Bat (Tom Sizemore) and Ed (Bill Pullman), then accidentally finds his calling when, in Wichita, he's roused from his sleep by a drunk's hoorawing of the town, overcomes him when the local marshal won't, and is made a deputy.  From there he's recruited to a similar office in the booming cowtown of Dodge City, which he ""tames"" with his anti-firearm ordinance and the help of brothers Virgil and Morgan (Linden Ashby), and while on a mission to Texas meets the tubercular Georgian dentist/gambler ""Doc"" Holliday (Dennis Quaid), who for reasons of his own takes to him deeply--and Wyatt to him, despite his father's maxim that only family counts (""Everyone else is just strangers"").  At last, convinced that he'll never get rich working for other people, Wyatt--by now acknowledged as the leader of the family despite his position as literal middle brother--takes his brothers, their wives (Catherine O'Hara, JoBeth Williams, Betty Buckley), and his own common-law wife Mattie (Mare Winningham) to Tombstone, with Doc and his paramour Big Nose Kate (Isabella Rossellini) tagging along for the ride.  Here he crosses swords with Sheriff John Behan (Mark Harmon) and the Clanton-McLaury ""cowboys"" and meets Behan's woman, Josie Marcus (Joanna Going), who leaves the sheriff for him shortly before the fight.

Though the exact cause of the enmity between the Earps and the Behan/Clanton/McLaury axis is never clearly explained (it's suggested that the Clanton and McLaury families were stagecoach robbers and rustlers of Mexican cattle, and that Behan preferred not to try to confront them, while the Earps found their conduct intolerable), the gunfight itself is recreated with close fidelity, and the whole look of the film is very gritty and dusty, as the West probably really was.  The friendship between Wyatt and the Mastersons, and later Wyatt and Holliday, is very well done (Quaid does a particularly good job of bringing his character to life).  And unlike most cinematic versions of the Earp legend, this one goes on to show what happened after the gunfight--the Earps holing up together for fear of mob action, their hearing and the dismissal of charges, the ambush of Virgil and Morgan by the survivors of the cowboys, and the pursuit of the latter by Wyatt, Doc, Warren (James Cavaziel), and several deputies.  (A closing crawl tells us that members of the cowboy faction continued to die ""mysterious deaths"" for years after the battle, as well as giving some information on the later lives of the Earps.)  The soundtrack by James Newton Howard&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wyatt-Earp/dp/B000008MWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wyatt Earp</a>&nbsp;is suitably epic and majestic.

Now, is this movie anywhere as good as Tombstone... I say no way...  Yes it does go way more indepth into who Wyatt Earp is and where he came from but Kevin Costner is just not good enough to overpower the great supporting cast in ""Tombstone""
I think Costner is a way better actor, therefore, he gets the nod over Kurt Russell in Tombstone, but Val Kilmer is what puts Tombstone over the top... His role in Tombstone is classic and leagues better than Dennis Quad in the Wyatt Earp film.

Corral"" (the title of an earlier movie starring Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, directed by the legendary John Ford). Kevin Costner, recently an Oscar winner for ""Dances With Wolves,"" stars as the lawman, Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday and two time Academy Award winner Gene Hackman as Wyatt's father. Hackman's top billing is somewhat misleading, as he's onscreen for less than 20 minutes. However, this film is a mostly accurate portrayal of Wyatt Earp (inaccuracies listed at the Wikipedia and Internet Movie Database pages for this movie).

The only minor negative was Isabella Rossellini, who is nowhere as pretty or as good an actress as her famous mother Ingrid Bergman (who will be best remembered for

It shows Wyatt as taking over leadership of the Earp brothers and as a frustrated businessman along with the many things Wyatt did to end up a lawman-gunfighter.  The defining event in his life in the movie is the loss of his wife, which colors all of his subsequent actions from mugging a man to stealing a horse to hunting buffalo, etc.  Dennis Quaid is outstanding as Doc Holliday as is Kevin Costner as Wyatt Earp.

622366,4,6303269826,"Wyatt Earp came out around the same time as Tomb Stone.  It seemed that Tomb Stone over shadowed Wyatt Earp for some reason but I much preferred Wyatt Earp.  Dennis Quad is a much better Doc Holiday than Val Kilmer.  In fact, as much as I like Kilmer him being Doc Holiday was one of the things that kept Tomb Stone from appealing to me.  On the other hand, Quad's Doc Holiday is one of Wyatt Earp's strong points.  Kostner is excellent in this role.  He is able to show Wyatt's personality changes throughout the movie as events effect his life.  This is a long movie but it has a good pace that makes the three plus hours go by quickly.  Not as well as Pearl Harbor did but not bad.  Even though the movie is long, and they cover a lot of territory, I couldn't help feeling that there were some holes left unfilled here and there.  Like, how did we get from point A to point D, what happened to B and C.  Overall, I really like Wyatt Earp and that's why it's in my collection.  One other thing worth mentioning about this movie is the fact that the famous shoot out at the O K Corale, is just that, a shoot out.  In older movie versions based on Wyatt Earp or the famous shoot out had it being a long drawn out battle with people taking cover etc.  I don't know which is more historically accurate but the difference stood out to me.

Now this is not a new movie but it is new to Blu-ray.  It carries a budget price which makes this movie an excellent value.  The Blu-ray video quality is very good on this movie.  Just notice the detail in the early scene where Wyatt as a boy is running through the corn field.  The audio is on par with modern movies as well.  You aren't going to get a lot of effects like a Star Wars movie but the sound is good.  Not tinny or thin sounding like some older movies that get transferred to a new format.  I'm interested in hearing how Disney deals with this issue on their remasters of very old movies being released again on Blu-ray.

If some how Wyatt Earp missed your VCR when first released and you like Westerns, this is a must see movie.

WYATT EARP, with its epic scale, vast landscapes, gorgeous cinematography that captures a past era not with special effects, but natural period beauty, is truly an example of filmmaking at its finest, but at a scale no longer appreciated by today's ever-sinking standards.

And what a shame that is. Lawrence Kasdan and Kevin Costner are both obviously in love with the epic westerns of the 40's and 50's, the works of legends like John Ford and Anthony Mann, and it was that combined love they put together to create the life story of Wyatt Earp to the big screen in 1994.

It bombed theatrically, but garnered a devout cult following when it hit video and cable, and still remains one of today's most popular contemporary westerns.

Warner Brothers, if you're reading this, excellent work on the Blu-ray release and very much thankful that the featurette gem ""Walk With A Legend"" is included! BUT..........

When are we going to see the Expanded Edition you released on VHS years ago on Blu-ray??? I've held onto my VCR for the sole reason of having a source to watch the only version of WYATT EARP's Expanded Edition on the market - it's the only VHS tape set I still own!

For those of you not familiar with the Expanded Edition, it includes expanded scenes between Wyatt and Doc Holliday that strengthen the bond between the two legends, added footage of Wyatt's childhood, additional scenes better-explaining the reasons behind the fued between the Earp's and Clanton's, a crucial element unfortunately glossed over in the theatrical version, and several other key elements.

It's about 20 minutes longer than the theatrical version.

WARNER BROTHERS - please, please, please release the Expanded Edition on Blu-ray soon!! Maybe even include a new retrospective documentary or at least a commentary by Costner and Kasdan - I can't tell you how many times I've heard Costner asked about his love of westerns, and he always talks about this film.

Dances.... had Native Americans and the U.S. Cavalry, but it was soooo esoterically lost that it would be hard to call it western.  So, I felt a need, a desire, a calling to make a western, so I jumped when Wyatt Earp was conceived.""  Surely, he knew that Tombstone was in the making.  Or was he so OUT of touch that he just didn't see it coming.  Was it the pressure of making a tv movie that caused him so much stress?  Heck, he didn't even look that convincing when he portrayed Lt. Dunbar, even though we know he was actually Kevin Costner.

Dennis Quaid hands in an admirable job as Doc Holliday, but nowhere near Val Kilmer's status as a Doc Holliday.  Nonetheless, he was incredible, and easily a highlight of the show.  Gotta go.  My eyelids are heavy, and I need to see about getting some",1214179200,2,1497,4.21830985915493
622413,5,6303269826,"Although this production goes somewhat flat after the sequence showing Wyatt as a buffalo hunter, the fault lies with the Director for trying too hard to show Earp as suddenly devoid of emotional response and empathy. In this, the movie tries a little too hard to ""explain"" him. The production is, however, pretty historically accurate and the revisionists don't take over the film completely.
However,the person responsible for deciding to ""slick down"" Costner's hair, (even when no portraits of Earp show him wearing his hair like that, and Costner's hair is too thin to look right greased down anyway)should be shot - it bugged me for the rest of the movie. The action is realistic, with out being gratuitous, and Dennis Quaid is SUPERB as Doc Holliday, the acting is generally fine, with excellent film work.
Earp was a freind of my Grandfather, who never represented him as anything but a common man, reacting to uncommon circumstances, with the honor, honesty and determination required by the times; this production remains true to the man.

622454,4,6303269826,"Having won the battle of the Robin Hoods, Costner wasn't so lucky with Wyatt Earp: forget Waterworld, this is still the biggest box-office disaster of Costner's career, a $63m epic Western that struggled to make $25m at the US box-office yet somehow managed to avoid being nicknamed 'Kevin's Gate' (although it did earn Michael Madsen's unending animosity when the lengthy shoot prevented him from playing Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction). Originally intended as a mini-series and tracing the famed lawman's life from farm boy, freight driver, law student, drunk, horse thief, buffalo hunter to the aftermath of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, it's an ambitious attempt at an American epic with an increasingly unlikeable main character, but it's more of an occasionally ambitious failure than a genuine success.

Not nearly as much fun as the rival Tombstone, it's often at its best in the early scenes detailing the side of Earp that the movies previously overlooked as he goes from idealism to bitterness and misogyny following the death of his first wife. Taking its lead from Nicholas Earp's credo that family comes first and ""Blood counts the most,"" Costner's determination not to play likable is admirable, but it casts a dour shadow over a film with increasingly little lightness or humour to break up its bleak view of an embittered man whose only real talent is for violence and make it more palatable. America tends to like its heroes cut and dried, but Costner's Earp is not so much flawed as downright unsympathetic at times - more of a 70s anti-hero than one who would find favour in the 90s, leaving a cruelly overlooked at Oscar time Dennis Quaid (stunningly good) as Doc Holliday to carry the audience sympathy.

Once the film enters more familiar territory with Earp's years as a lawman, the flaws start to become more significant. Even in the extended laser disc directors cut many of the huge supporting cast tend to get lost and forgotten and at times it feels like its treading water, never really going into much detail about the reasons for the feud between the Earps and the Clantons and the McLaurys, while the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral itself is badly staged - even the 'walk thing' makes Wyatt, Doc and the brothers just look like a bunch of angry Mennonites - and the film loses momentum afterwards, which is surprising considering the aftermath is in many ways far more interesting than the gunfight itself. On a visual level, Kasdan's direction is somewhat disappointing: despite having huge resources at his disposal, there's a striking lack of long shots to take advantage of them that becomes much more noticeable on the small screen than the big, while despite the length there are increasingly few memorable or significant scenes en route to the contentious epilogue. One of the most misconceived endings of the 90s (at least until Costner's The Postman came along), a clumsy flashback-led variation on 'Print the legend' that seems to be arguing that the legend is indeed true, it does the film no favours and probably did much to leave audiences unimpressed.

It's a shame, because for all its faults there's much in the film to admire, from some fine supporting performances among the huge cast - the aforementioned Quaid, horribly gaunt and convincingly tubercular, Gene Hackman, Bill Pullman, Michael Madsen, Tom Sizemore, Annabeth Gish - and a superb score from James Newton Howard. Perhaps for once a little less ambition and a little more light rather than constant shade would have yielded a more successful result.

The film is annoyingly spread over two sides of a single disc, although boasts a good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer. Along with the full theatrical trailer (but not the teaser, which included somedeleted scenes) it also includes the deleted scenes from the Director's Cut as well as two featurettes on the making of the film culled from interviews shot at the time.",1194912000,,3924,4.958966565349544

622456,4,6303269826,"A long movie that takes awhile to pick up steam, particularly since it serves as a virtual biography of Wyatt from his youth to the aftermath of Tombstone. Costner plays a very pensive and hard character sharply in contrast to Kurt Russell's version, which may be why Costner needed to show Earp's loss of his young wife. But once the film evolves after showing Wyatt's difficulties and steps up into the mature portion of his life, the film becomes very interesting particularly when he meets the Masterson brothers. The movie is pretty accurate in historic detail such as the death of Ed Masterson with Wyatt moving on to other towns with emphasis of course on Tombstone. The heavy part of this Wyatt version is his domination over his brothers, which seems less likely as his older brother Virgil was already in the southwest New Mexico or Arizona area before and they were all interested in the mining boom town potential of Tombstone. Costner's character is pretty sublime and not too dimensional; however, historians describe the real Earp as a true quiet, strong, no nonsense type that was action oriented with a unique ability to talk people out of causing trouble in a direct style or he would use the buffalo technique with his pistol rather than shooting at first opportunity. The cast is very good, the action not as dynamic as the movie Tombstone but realistic. Dennis Quaid does a fantastic job as Doc Holiday, not as memorable as Val Kilmer's in Tombstone, but very well done. Between the two films, Tombstone and Costner's, Costner's Earp is very believable as a driven man who without much emotion stands up at the end in his revenge drive to kill the responsible cowboys that murdered his brother Morgan and crippled his brother Virgil in an ambush. The strongest part of the film of course occurs at the end of the Tombstone saga when the Earps confront their enemies directly near the back lot of the OK corral and when Wyatt goes on his revenge raid after the cowardly shooting of his brothers. This is where Costner's Earp is very believable as he methodical goes after the killers. I recommend seeing both, Tombstone first than Wyatt Earp, they are both worth seeing and an interesting contrast. Just prepare yourself for the three hour plus time of Costner's. Editting wouldhave enhanced the film but after seeing it through, it will go down as being a superior film. I have recently visited Tombstone and it is truly a wonderful place to visit with many historic buildings and a well preserved section of the town. Best to go in the third week of October during Helldarado  days when western re-enactors invest the town in authentic period regalia.",1194480000,,2673,4.7982646420824295

622458,4,6303269826,"First off, I'm a nut for movies about Wyatt Earp.

It's interesting to see how each film tackles the western legend of honor and vengence. It's also interesting to note that no matter how closer to depicting the actual events the later films, including this one, has gotten, one thing never changes. The Earps are always shown as the good guys and the Clanton/McLaury ""gang"" as the outlaws. In truth, the events in Tombstone Arizona in the early 1880's was mostly a turf war. Both sides wanted control of Tombstone for the purpose of making money and both sides were unwilling to compromise. Both groups had the ""law"" on their side with the Earps as town Marshalls and Cochise County Sheriff John Behan joining the Clanton/McLaury side.

What makes Costner's ""Wyatt Earp"" unique to all the other films is for the first time we see the early life of Wyatt. We see him as a happy-go-lucky young man in awe of all that is around him. We get to see the tragedy of the death of his first wife and how it effected him. And we see him turn into the cold, stubborn person he became. Costner does a good job in his portrayal of Earp and the filming of the movie is outstanding. And for one of the first times that I know of, we see the character of Jame Earp portrayed. In most, if not all, other films it's mostly Wyatt, Virgil & Morgan, although ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral"" did have a small part of a younger Earp (Warren?) who ends up getting killed early on.

On the character of Doc Holiday, it's my opinion that Dennis Quaid here has done the best job at portaying and sick, surly, and almost suicidal drunkard & killer that Holiday is know to have been. His one redeeming quality is his loyalty to Wyatt. A close second is Victor Mature in the mostly fictional ""My Darling Clementine.""

Some of the downsides to this movie: It's long, too long. I understand it's an epic but there are times when certain scenes have a filler feel to them, just not necessary. The music is pretty forgettable. And the character of Josie, played by Joanna Going, is not very compelling. The actress does a decent job but in comparing her to, say, Dana Delany in Tombstone, she's just not the force that you can imagine grabbing Wyatt's affection after all the years of hiding behind his sorrow.

All-in-All, a decent film, worth watching. I would recommend it to any western fan and any Costner fan. Maybe not as good as his western&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Open-Range/dp/B0000TANUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Open Range</a>&nbsp;but believe me, much better that most of his other offerings.",1189555200,,3333,5.880165289256198
622459,5,6303269826,"After reading previous reviews on Costner's ""Wyatt Earp"" I have to say that most people miss the point of this movie. Rather than trying to be an entertaining ""Indiana Jones cliff-hanger"" I feel the film's producers and director wanted more of a biography of the Earp family that is more historically accurate, as opposed to a ""rock 'em sock 'em"" adventure. This is why the film runs so long, it needs to tell a long story. The Earp's time in Tombstone and the famous OK Corral gunfight was only a fraction of the Earp's existence. It has been made into, via Hollywood and endless story-telling throughout the years, much more than it really was -- a feud between rival factions that was common in America's move West during the 19th century.

In my opinion, if the makers of the film made any blunders in the story-line and plot in regards to making an interesting big-budget western epic, they dwell too much on the old Hollywood formula of making the famous gunfight the ""excitement fulcrum,"" thus forcing the early part of the film to spend lots of time leading up to it. This forces the rest of the film's story of the ""vengeance ride"" -- a part of Wyatt Earp's and Doc Holliday's lives that was by itself exciting, with enough material for its own separate film -- seem anti-climatic. In other words, the film tries to tell too much.

That being said, I highly recommend watching this film, not for its lack of being exciting (it does has its moments however), but as a wonderful western bio-epic that captures the spirit of the old West. Dennis Quaid puts on a stellar performance as Doc Holliday (much better than Val Kilmer's more-or-less comedic approach in ""Tombstone""), and it is beautifully shot, with scenes constantly augmented with a soaring soundtrack. Kevin Costner in the lead Wyatt Earp role doesn't try to make something out of nothing by over-acting. He allows the story of the Earps tell itself -- something you don't see much from actors. The strength and appeal of this movie lies in its sum and essence, not its ""excitement factor.""

In this age, two thumbs down.
 There are some fine actors here.  Unfortunately, they have been written to be and directed to be characters less than the capability of their talent.  This movie is not simply a gritty western, nor is it a great romance, nor is it an ambitious biography, but it tries to be all of these without finally defining itself.  I want to assume that most of the ""facts"" of the movie are fairly true, or ""Hollywood true,"" which compelled me to watch it to the end, but the dialogue is patterned and scripted (well, duh!) and predictable.  I'm not talking about everyday speech, but the plethora of those one liners that we just know that they must have said.
 Foreshadowing is one thing, but orchestrated, TV-level plot revelations are not just an insult to an intelligent viewer, but, alas, boring.  To even compare this (as some previous reviewers have) to The Unforgiven is an affront to the Western as a genre.

This scene and the one following where Virgil and James Earp return from the War are two of the most compelling in the film.

The remainder of the two-disk film closes with Wyatt much older having survived the Western frontier and moving on to Alaska.  It's a hopeful ending and a beautifully filmed one, too.

622496,4,6303269826,"This film has received mixed reviews, mostly focused upon differing opinions on Costner's portrayal of Wyatt Earp. Some say that Costner is too stoic and unemotional, while others comments that, well, that's the way Earp really was. Both miss the point.

The crux of Costner's performance is that he anchors the film. As a producer, he helped give this motion picture artistic direction, and as an actor, he is the keystone of the production. Granted, Dennis Quaid is tremendous as Doc Holliday. Still, Costner's stage presense in the film give it a great deal of its depth. This is one of Costner's best performances, due largely to his success in portraying Wyatt Earp as a man who was motivated and governed by his own internal code, rather than the hardships that continually confronted him.

(Beware: Plot Spoilers ahead!) We follow Wyatt Earp from his boyhood days learning life's lessons from his lawyer father, here protrayed by Gene Hackman. We see Earp enduring the death of his first wife Verilla from Typhoid (watch for the mom from ""Little House on the Prairie"" portraying Verilla's mother). Earp falls into despair, attempting to drown his sorrows in alcohol. He descends into a criminal existence, only to be incarcerated as a horse thief. He is rescued by his father and journeys west, where he, almost by accident, is drawn into the life of a lawman in Dodge City.

What is most compeling about Costner's portrayal of Wyatt Earp is how his character evolves through his confrontations with outlaws. He begins the film as an idealistic, adventurous young man who is at heart a romantic. The tragedy of his first wife's death, coupled with his continual confrontations with ruthless outlaws, causes a profound shift from youthful exuberance to cold, tough survivalism. Earp depends on the enforcement of the law, because in the old west that's all there was to depend upon. Costner successfully portrays Earp's abandonment of his youthful ideals as his reputation as a lawman grows.

It is not until Earp finds love again that his inner self appears to be reawakened; this is portrayed in a believeable, if not overly emotional fashion.

As aforementioned, it is Costner's stage presense that gives this film its anchor. He presents Earp as a man whose sense of identity was stronger than the wickedness and lawlessness of his countrymen, and it was this quality that gave Earp what he needed to survive and triumph over the criminals that hounded him continually. To the film's credit, this facet of Earp's character is not presently overtly, but rather very successfully inferred by Costner's intense portrayal of one of the Old West's most controversial and misunderstood figures.

I strongly recommend this film, particularly to Costner fans. Just about anyone with an interest in the Old West might find merit in this film, so give it a shot (no pun intended). You'll be glad you did.

Note: Watch for Tea Leoni's ""cameo"" as a prostitute attempting to seduce Wyatt during his formative years in the west. Remember her from ""The Family Man"" with Nick Cage? She's almost unrecognizeable here.",1183939200,3,3110,4.992277992277992

622498,3,6303269826,"Released a year after another Wyatt Earp bio-pic, 1993's Tombstone (which featured Kurt Russell in the role), Lawrence Kasdan's Wyatt Earp is a would-be western epic that is supremely disappointing.  Kevin Costner (who also served as producer) is in the title role as the legendary lawman in this incredibly overlong look at the life and times of Wyatt Earp, and his droll performance is what really hurts Kasdan's overall vision.  Despite that though, it's hard not to admire the effort that Kasdan and co. had put into making this film.  Many slow moments aside, Kasdan manages to present a more personal tale of Earp's life than that of what we saw in Tombstone, and that in itself sets Wyatt Earp apart from the modern western pack.  The rest of the cast, which includes Gene Hackman as Earp's father, Dennis Quaid in a fine performance as Doc Holiday (I still prefer Val Kilmer though), as well as Michael Madsen, Linden Ashby, David Andrews, Jeff Fahey, Joanna Going, Mark Harmon, Bill Pullman, Isabella Rossellini, Tom Sizemore, JoBeth Williams, Adam Baldwin, James Caviezel, and Tea Leoni, don't always fare as well as one would hope, but the overall atmosphere that Kasdan weaves manages to make up for most of the casting shortcomings.  This Two-Disc Special Edition doesn't really pack it in on the special features department (no commentary at all), but the film is presented here in all it's widescreen glory, and it looks fantastic and better than ever thanks to the outstanding picture quality.  You may prefer Tombstone over Wyatt Earp or vise versa, but either way you look at it, Wyatt Earp is an overly ambitious project that isn't without it's disappointments.",1182556800,,1680,4.960854092526691

Costner and Kasdan set out to make an epic hollywood movie about a historical figure... to tell his life story in as interesting (but factual) manner as possible. Yes there were some inaccuracies, such as Virgil being shot on the same night Morgan was murdered, but they were minor compared to the TRUTH that went into this adventure...

622553,4,6303269826,"This movie came out a few months after the other ""Wyatt Earp"" biopic and while everybody loved Kurt Russell's Tombstone / Wyatt Earp, this film got slammed.

Personally, I love westerns and I really enjoyed Tombstone. But I think this was a more ambitious effort and notwithstanding the criticism that it ran too long, I think it's a better film then Tombstone.

Tombstone was enjoyable and light and a very entertaining diversion for a couple of hours - especially the scene's which included Val Kilmer's Doc  Holliday.

But Wyatt Earp presented a much more accurate and in-depth depiction of one of the west's most enduring characters. And unlike other Wyatt Earp / gunfight at the OK Corral pics, this film devoted quite a bit of time to the earlier years of Wyatt Earp and the events that shaped his life leading up to the infamous Gunfight.

It presented a more in-depth portrayal of the other people in his life - Josie Marcus / his in-laws (who couldn't stand him for the ""cold"" character that he was) / Doc Holliday / Bat Masterson and many others.

Personally, I would love to see a sequel to this film that picks up the lives of Wyatt and Josie after the dust had settled in Tombstone. They spent close to 50 years together and took in the goldfields of the north / horse racing and boxing in California and prospecting in Arizona.

This novie had a fine supporting cast however, my biggest complaint would be that the actors I most enjoyed didn't have especially prominent supporting roles. Gene Hackman as Wyatt's father was great (as always) however, he didn't have alot of time on the screen. It was his father who installed in Wyatt at a young age the importance of family and justice.

Michael Madsen, one of my favorites, played Wyatt's brother Virgil, however, he too didn't have alot of lines.

And kudos to Dennis Quaid for his protrayal of Doc Holliday. He may not have gotten the press of Val Kilmer, but you have to respect the fact that he lost 38 lbs of weight in order to capture the appearence of a man who was been eaten up with consumption / tuberculosis.

I think the primary reason I enjoyed this film is that it portrayed Wyatt Earp in a much more realistic light - it portrayed him as a great, but ""flawed"" man which, from everything I've read about the man (and that's alot of books), he was flawed. I think the death of his wife at a young age had a profound impact on Wyatt's relationships in later years. And I think this folm brought that out.

I don't think this is a great film / western - I'll reserve that word for many of Sergio Leone's and John Ford's films, but I think it's alot better than the reviews it got at the time.

But I'll take my hat off to Kevin Costner for making a film about Wyatt Earp that doesn't just focus on THE GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL.

And as a fan of westerns and an avid reader of western history, I'm grateful to him for making this movie. And in view of the fact that so few westerns are made these days, I'm certainly not complaining about the 3 hours plus of this film.",1170374400,20,3045,4.425760286225403

622557,2,6303269826,"I had two major types of exposure to the legend of the Okay Corral.  The first was seeing the Star Trek episode ""The Scepter of the Gun,"" where the Enterprise crew find themselves in Tombstone being taken for being the Clantons.  The other was a series in the Mandrake the Magician comic strip, where the Clantons were the villains.  (I also did visit Tombstone once.)  I desired to learn more about the shootout.

The first scene starts with Wyatt Earp's brothers telling him that the Clantons were out by the Okay Corral, and they left.  Then, the movie goes to Earp's childhood.  At the end of the first of the two VHS tapes, Wyatt and his brothers were on their way to Tombstone.  This movie reminds me a little of Ben Hur.  Ben Hur's chariot race was not the climax of that movie, just as the showdown at the corral was not the climax of this movie, though the chariot race was much more exciting.

Another movie I thought of when seeing this movie was ""The Untouchables,"" which also starred Costner.  I see a common ground between Earp and Eliot Ness.  However, I found Ness a more sympathetic character than Earp.  Earp was a stubborn adulterer who didn't have any real concern for his wife.

Not only did Costner fail to win me over in his role as Earp, but the Clantons were not effectively dealt with.  They never came across as the villains who needed to die.  The shootout almost resembles an example of police brutality.

The two redeeming things in this movie were the performances of Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday (a major change from his role in ""The Rookie"") and Mare Winningham as Mattie Blaylock, Wyatt's wronged wife.  These two performances were both worthy of supporting role Oscars.

This was not the first time that director Lawrence Kasdan worked with Kevin Costner in a Western.  Silverado was definitely a better movie.",1167177600,5,1845,4.635802469135802
622558,4,6303269826,"""Law and Order"" (1932), a film starring Walter Huston and Harry Carey, had blazed the Earp screen trail with a brave version of the 0. K. Corral happenings, although the true-life characters were never named... ""Frontier Marshal"" (1939) starring Randolph Scott and ""Wichita"" (1955) with Joel McCrea also told the story...

To most modern cinema-goers, however, the Corral incident and the confused events and motivations which led to it have been best served by four films, John Ford's ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946), John Sturges' ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral,"" (1957), Sturges' ""Hour of the Gun"" (1967), and George P. Cosmatos' ""Tombstone"" (1993). But the question has yet to be solved: should the American West be depicted on the screen as it actually was, or should it continue to be a form of mythology?

Hollywood's version of history is considerably at variance with the facts, and life on the frontier in the 19th century would appear to have been more dull and monotonous than exciting and colorful... Certainly, life in Tombstone, Arizona, in its time of greatest prosperity as a mining town must have been anything but healthy, with its vast number of rough working men relieving their boredom with drinking and brawling, and occasionally shooting each other...

In Kasdan's epic Western, Earp is the upright defender of the law, and Doc, a dissolute gambler... Nevertheless, the men are compassionate and respectful, and both have a kind of dignity... Holliday is much more credible as the black sheep of an aristocratic Virginia family and a jaded idealist... Dennis Quaid allowed himself to lose 30 pounds of his weight only to accurately portray the gun-notorious Doc Holliday, now, alas devoted to the bottle and in the latter stages of tuberculosis...

In this instance we have Quaid breathing fire and fury at the slightest hint of an insult before breathing more heavily into his handkerchief... He's a multi-dimensional human being who provides most of the film's best moments... His character has his own form of ability... Quaid does a far better work of portraying the effects of Holliday's tuberculosis... Kilmer, in ""Tombstone,"" never seems to have anything worse than a bad flu, except when it's dramatically necessary for him to look bad in greater degree...

Earp (Kevin Costner) finds Doc sincere but nevertheless strikes up an understanding which one feels will blossom into grudging joint gun-action should the need arise... The need is obviously there in villainous Clantons and McLaurys... The path is well and truly pointed to that rendezvous at the Corral...

Kasdan's motion picture covers areas of Earp's life that George P. Cosmatos' film ""Tombstone"" does not even touch... While ""Tombstone"" was an action picture, centering on the events leading up to and including the famous gunfight, Lawrence Kasdan's ""Wyatt Earp"" focused on the man himself and his life from childhood to the confrontation and beyond...The film starts with the teenage Earp and progresses through old age...

The action in Kasdan's film is firm and fresh, nicely photographed and the story well told... But we always remember Ford's ""My Darling Clementine"" for its other qualities--for the unhurried lulls and the 'time off' taken on the way... This is Ford indulging himself, as was his habit, but on this occasion the indulgences all come off and are imparted with magic...

""My Daring Clementine"" was a film of touches--Fonda, seated, adjusting his boots and his balance while the world, such as it is, goes by; Fonda, the peacemaker, right-and-properly in church; Fonda, with an old-world frontier concept of courtesy leading his lady in the out of doors dance...

Earp in Kasdan's biopic is an ordinary man who met and married a beautiful young woman who died of typhoid a short time after the marriage... Profoundly bitter about her death, he goes from a drunken fellow to horse thief to buffalo hunter to stagecoach driver to Dodge City, Kansas where he became one of the most famous ""Westerners"" of all time...",1162684800,,4028,5.1187214611872145

622597,5,6303269826,"This is one of the best, and underrated, westerns ever made. It was a very intense, interesting character study of a famous lawman, showing flaws and all. In fact, this is the only version, I believe, that really shows the sadistic side of Wyatt Earp, and what made him a bitter man. To be fair, it also shows his good traits.

It also has a terrific, deep cast and features a good mix of drama, romance and action. Even the music grows on you after several viewings. There is no humor in here: this is a serious story. Unlike the more popular ""Tombstone,"" this Earp story has a lot less profanity and almost no usage of the Lord's name in vain....but there is rough language and some crude sexual remarks, so don't watch it with the kiddies.

At rate, the movie is a lot better than the critics would have you believe. (All nationally-known critics but one panned this, as far as I know.) Kevin Costner performed one of his better acting jobs. It was nice to see Michael Madsen and Tom Sizemore as good guys. That's not seen in too many films! They were low-key characters, too. Dennis Quaid did a nice job as the fascinating ""Doc Holliday."" It's generally conceded that Val Kilmer's ""Doc"" in ""Tombstone"" was the best-ever, but Quaid version is just fine, thank you, and gets better and better with each viewing.

This is a long movie, but it's never dull and it never overdoes the action, either. The cast is deep so you see a lot of familiar actors. As mentioned, this film is extremely underrated.

The first hour of Wyatt Earp is insufferably Kevin.  Almost every false Costner quirk that we know and loathe from almost endless repitition is on display.  Then magic starts to happen.  The dirty gritty magnificent grandeur of the West pulls even the constricted star of this movie into an approximation of greatness.  For perhaps the first time in his life, and certainly for the first time in my experience, Costner fills a role without making it ridiculous.  Before it's over, Costner's Wyatt Earp is the West, at least the longed for West of my imagination.  Coster stares out a backlit window into the night, rain coming down, and says ""Kill 'em all.""  It's yesterday -- 1881 -- once more.

Most reviewers resent the amorphous sprawl of this movie, but life's like that, amorphous and sprawling and without tidy transitions.  The movie gets the rampant manic energy of creative destruction that filled those years (at least in my imagination) after the war and before the Gilded Age and during the second or third of America's great depressions.  And it gets the ""accepted"" record right, too, the things and places that (we believe) filled the days of the brothers, their wives and laudanum whores, their rowdy consumptive friends.

It also gets & gives magic moments I've seen in no other film and probably can't describe.  It's after the war; lawyer Earp & his family head west.  There's a western town square, seen from above, the camera looking down perhaps from a two-story false front at a tough stringy old man who looks up at the camera as if he sees the strange glint of something from another century.  It's as if we've wormholed back to 1867 and have caught a piece of time.

Later, a fistfighter walks past the camera and out of the frame as if the camera was an unseen intruder transported from another time and place.

But the production was scaled down when news that a rival Earp project, TOMBSTONE, was also in production.

(Bob ""Boze"" Bell, the editor of True West magazine, has several excellent books on Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday worth checking out).

The big question when TOMBSTONE came out first, then WYATT EARP was: Which one do you like better?

Well, I love the story enough to like them both.

TOMBSTONE is more of the crowd-pleasing Western where the Good Guys vs. the Bad Guys.

But WYATT EARP tries to dig a little deeper, aim closer to the human side of the history and legend (and how they intersect).  Wyatt didn't show up in Tombstone wearing a white cowboy hat and a shiny badge--and he certainly didn't leave that way.  Of all the movies of the gunfight at the OK Corral, WYATT EARP comes the closest to depicting the 38-second gunfight than all the others (just go to the Cochise County courthouse in Tombstone and check out the second-by-second depictions on the walls).

And Dennis Quaid was ROBBED at award time that year.  His Doc Holliday was amazing.  He looked, as Holliday was described, ""dead from the eyes down.""  Since I've always heard that the cameras add five pounds to everyone, Quaid must have looked like a ghostly apparition during the shoot.  And I've heard that a doctor was on the set every day for him.

As far as I'm concerned, he's right up there with DeNiro in RAGING BULL as far as how far an actor will go to play a part.

I've also read in these reviews complaints about Costner's performance--something I didn't have a problem with.

After reading several Earp biographies and other books about the West and Tombstone, Costner plays him with the type of stoic remoteness that most of those accounts record.  Testimony about the OK Corral gunfight cite that Wyatt was ""cool as cucumber"" as he drew his gun and took careful aim before firing.

I also really loved the music in this film.

And I'm not the only one: for years I've heard it used in trailers for other films (along with the BRAVEHEART soundtrack), and I bought the soundtrack on CD.  Good stuff.

I would've loved to have seen what they really wanted to do with this film.

The movie version is protracted and bloody (not to say that the real fight wasn't) and quite removed from real history. Historians who know of what they speak inform us that the gun fight lasted only a couple minutes and took place at a range of about 7 yards with all the combatants facing each other. In WYATT EARP that has been reasonably faithfully recreated.

My personal preference, obviously, is this film. I loved the epic feel of it. ""Tombstone"" for me, was more Hollywood with thinly drawn characters, who played second fiddle to the climactic battle, and lots of gunfighting. ""Wyatt Earp"" took its time. Some say that that is its biggest drawback. I never once felt the movie was getting long in the tooth. Following Earp around, watching him grow into the legend he'd become, was fascinating. There was more drama to it, more emotion. I absolutely adored this film and recommend it to any fan of Westerns and of Wyatt Earp in particular.

As side note I'd like to say that anyone who believes Kilmer edged Quaid as Doc Holiday must not have been watching the same movie. Kilmer with his pale make-up and hollywood jezibelle accent just doesn't hold a candle Quaid. Qauid dropped 40 pounds for the role. His skin looked loose and sickly. His voice was a booming, phlegm-filled southern drawl accented with frequent bouts of severe coughing. Dennis Quaid became Doc Holiday, whereas Kilmer merely starred as the character.

But ""Wyatt Erp"" is not an action movie. It is an epic, concentrating on a character study of what made this man the legend he became.  Costner does a superb job. (better, and with more depth than Kurt Russell, although Russell was also good, so this is a compliment to Costner, not a complaint about Russell) Dennis Quiad is as good as Val Kilmar in his portrayal of Doc Holiday but he is not featured as much as Kilmar was and does not have all the good lines Kilmar had, such as ""I have two guns, one for each of you.""

622652,5,6303269826,"I have heard much said in comparison between WYATT EARP, starring Kevin Costner, and TOMBSTONE, starring Kurt Russell.  Invariably most critics seem to gravitate to the shorter, bloodier TOMBSTONE.  But I'd have to say that I like both for different reasons.

WYATT EARP is classic Costner.  Long, meticulously accurate and comprehensive.  I like this movie for the insight that it provides into Earp's storied life.  Earp's adolescence and early adulthood are usually left out leading Earp aficionados to believe that he was born full grown and living in Tombstone instead of in Missouri.  The story of the loss of his wife and the short-lived life of crime were fascinating.  Earp's work as a buffalo skinner and freighter also added to the ultimate lore.

WYATT EARP is very likely one of Costner's best performances, more believable than his role as John Dunbar in DANCES WITH WOLVES and a precursor to his recent triumph in OPEN RANGE.

As with TOMBSTONE, it's interesting that the scene stealer is Doc Holliday, played in WYATT EARP by Dennis Quaid.  Whereas TOMBSTONE'S Doc, Val Kilmer, emerges as more of a dandy, Quaid, with the emaciated personna that he assumed for the role (he lost over forty pounds!), his steely-eyed scowl and his rampant sarcasm, is much more believable as Holliday, reputed to be one of the coldest killers in the history of the West, than is Kilmer.  Granted, Kilmer is wonderful, but Dennis Quaid emerges as the frightening, psychotic killer that Holliday was.

WYATT EARP also showcases the talents of many of Hollywood's brightest stars.  Gene Hackman, though in no more than a cameo, is wonderful as Nicholas Earp, the patriarch of a large family who instills within the minds of his family that nothing matters more than blood and kin.  Catherine O'Hara and JoBeth Williams star as the feisty wives of Morgan and James Earp. Mare Winningham is perfect as the ill-fated Mattie Blaylock, the woman who assumed that she was Wyatt Earp's common-law wife and, in the end, fades into a cloud drug-induced stupor.  Bill Pullman is wonderful as Ed Masterson, the ""affable,"" unheralded brother of the famous Bat Masterson, played by Tom Sizemore. And Ma Ingles, Karen Grassle, is trotted out in the cameo of Wyatt's mother-in-law, Mrs. Sutherland.

Yes, WYATT EARP is long and drawn out. But the story, the James Newton Howard soundtrack and the wonderful panoramic cinematography are well worth it.

622654,3,6303269826,"OVERVIEW: Good story. Outstanding cast. Some good dialogue. A few good gun shooting and fight scenes. But, plain and simple - director Lawrence Kasdan's ""Wyatt Earp"" is just WAY TOO LONG (3+ hours). You shave 60-70 minutes off this movie to bring it down to the 2 hour mark and perhaps it's a better ride on your sofa.
THE CAST: Main stars are Kevin Costner as Wyatt Earp, and Dennis Quaid as Doc Holiday. The rest of the entire cast is secondary. Tho secondary - the rest of the cast is superb - featuring Gene Hackman, Mark Harmon, Isabella Rossellini, Catherine O'Hara, Tom Sizemore, Jobeth Williams, Tea Leoni, Michael Madsen, and James Caviezel. I thought it was an added bonus to see some of these actors trying their hand at a true western picture - like Rossellini (mostly drama or romantic type movies), Sizemore (mostly war pictures), O'Hara (mostly comedies), Williams (""Big Chill"" & ""Poltergeist"" and that's about all I remember for her)... and not even remembering Caviezel in this picture until seeing him in ""The Passion Of The Christ"" and then having to go back to watch ""Wyatt Earp"" again.
DVD EXTRAS: This is a 2-disc set... where did the bonus features disappear to? I figure with most movies that Kevin Costner has something to do with, they're usually long, somewhat tedious, and lots of attention to detail... despite if the picture might make some critic's worst-ever movie list (i.e. ""Waterworld"", ""The Postman"", ""The Bodyguard""). ""Wyatt Earp"" has 2 short 15-minute documentaries, some deleted (""lifted"") scenes, and a trailer. No lie, that's it.
I wanted to like this movie more... as much say, as I thoroughly enjoyed it's sister flick from the year before, ""Tombstone"". Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer (in the role of his life) were awesome together in ""Tombstone""; not to mention a nicely cast group of nasty boys featuring Powers Booth and Michael Biehn. ""Wyatt Earp"" succeeded with Costner and the supporting cast, but Quaid's ""Doc"" was missing some flare. Not that this was soley Quaid's fault. But, because Kilmer's redention was so good in ""Tombstone"" that anyone else portraying ""Doc"" in any movie afterward was destined to be somewhat of a let down. Another bonus in ""Wyatt Earp"" is the sweeping views of the land - some truly wonderful cinematography. ""Wyatt Earp"" is much more detailed than any of it's predecessors in following Wyatt's early days... from Wichita, to Dodge City, to the OK Corral in Tombstone, AZ. This was a good movie - just not the best on the subject of the Earps.",1088726400,6,2518,4.871794871794871
622655,3,6303269826,"There's a lot to like in Lawrence Kasdan's deconstruction of desperate western heroes in the epic WYATT EARP Two-Disc Special Edition (Warner).
This admirable, sometimes pretentious attempt to capture the complex, multi-faceted character of lawman and criminal Wyatt Earp (an uneven Kevin Costner) from Wichita to Dodge to the showdown at Tombstone's O.K. Corral does not always work but it sure looks great. Dennis Quaid is memorable as Earp's lethal pal Doc Holliday.
This is the 190 minute version.  The twenty two additional minutes that are in the extended VHS version are presented separately here as ""lifted scenes.""",1088035200,4,623,5.357142857142857
622656,3,6303269826,"Wyatt Earp was ok, but it just doesn't measure up to Tombstone, the movie about the same subject which was released one year earlier.
Pros:  This movie covers all of Earp's life and allows us to see him develop more as a character, especially in regard to his wife and the woman he lived with for most of his life before the city of Tombstone.
Cons:  The musical score seemed very repetitive and less-than-impressive.  Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid simply do not compare to the Tombstone performances of Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer (Even though I do not think that Kilmer is that great of an actor, his role as Doc Holiday is one of the best characters I have seen on screen).
In comparison, I'd give this movie 2 or less stars, but judging it on its own, I have to give it at least 3, if for no other reason, for its grand scale.",1087344000,,831,4.314102564102564

It's nice to be able to see Warner Bros. release a film in the Western genre that, for once, doesn't have anything to do with Clint Eastwood. Val Kilmer's portrayal of the same character in ""Tombstone"" wasn't nearly as good as the one in this edition. I don't own the Digital Video Disc yet, so I'm not sure if I read something correctly which said that the actual three-hour feature is split onto two discs. I really hope it isn't.

This is most fitting given the fact that this is one of the very best Westerns that I have ever seen.  The performances are excellent as are the direction and script.  Best of all, unlike most movies about western legends like Wyatt Earp, this movie was made with a strict reliance on historical fact as it really is  and not some tall tale.  This is important because the likes of Wyatt Earp did all they can to create a mythology about how brave and noble they were to cover up for the fact that the real life Earp and friends were not all that much different from the bad guys that they fought against.",1086220800,3,700,4.2330827067669174
622709,4,6303269826,"Larger than life and with twice as many brothers, ""Wyatt Earp"" struts onto the DVD scene in a ""Special Edition"" that looks stunning but is less filling than one might have expected. This sprawling episodic tale begins with Wyatt as a child preparing to run away from home and join the Union army like his brothers Virgil and James. His father (Gene Hackman in a brief but powerful performance)catches him as he leaves and returns him back home. While Wyatt clearly yearns from the adventure he feels his brothers are experiencing, his father knows the truth about war and sets him straight.

Later, James and Virgil return home both exhausted and beat up from serving in the army. Their father has put on his traveling shoes and announces that the family will be moving West where there's opportunity for a lawyer and rich land is ready to be farmed.

Wyatt after many trials and tribulations ends up out west as a lawman. He manages to interest his brothers in coming out to help clean up Dodge City as well. We also get the thunderous conflict at the OK Corral as part of the conclusion of the film and witness a wonderful performance by Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday. While the narrative is a bit too episodic and flawed, the film manages to retain one's interest throughout it's 190 minute running time due to Costner's unassuming portrayal as Wyatt. The real highlight, though, is Quaid as Doc capturing the fragile gunfighter as he fights the consumption that eats him alive.

With the long wait for ""Wyatt Earp"" to appear on DVD, one would have hoped to have a special edition with a commentary from director Lawrence Kasdan, star Costner and a look back at the film's reception when it was first released a decade ago. Unfortunately, the Warner Special Edition sticks to the basics for the most part: we get the original 190 minute theatrical cut of the film (sans the extended scenes that were added to the video version); two documentaries one ""new"" one that includes vintage interviews and the other a 1994 TV special; ""lifted scenes"", i.e., the footage included in the special video edition and the theatrical trailer.

Let's start with the good stuff first. The stunning anamorphic widescreen transfer finely does justice to Kasdan's epic vision for this larger than life western biography. The remastered 5.1 sound captures just about every nuance from the original theatrical exhibition 10 years ago. Honestly, ""Wyatt Earp"" hasn't sounded this good since it was first released in 1994.

The negatives are few but worth noting. The documentaries are pretty good although a bit too brief. Perhaps Kasdan preferred his original theatrical cut to the extended version. That could explain why these sequences show up on the second disc and aren't integrated into the film. The lack of a commentary track is a big minus for the disc, though, as 1)Knowing how the film compared to the life of Earp would have been fascintating and 2) Kasdan's plans while shooting the film and comments would have been welcome.

With the recent deluxe release of ""Open Range"", I would have hoped for better from this release. On the other hand, great care was used in transferring this for DVD and the extras are roughly what ""Unforgiven"" received when it was re-released. Kudos to Warner for such a marvelous looking DVD although, again, more extras should have been included.",1085270400,89,3367,4.846956521739131
622710,4,6303269826,"If the film Tombstone was a cheeseburger and fries, then Wyatt Earp is a nice thick ribeye.  After an inexplicably long wait however, Wyatt Earp arrives on DVD in only a decent package at best.  The picture's new digital transfer and the remastered 5.1 soundtrack are terrific.  Two nice documentaries (albeit brief) are added as well as the trailer and the extra scenes from the expanded edition.
What are disappointments are the fact that the extra scenes were not incorporated in the film here (only accessable as an extra feature), no commentary from ANYONE, no animated menus, no biogrophies or filmogrophies.  You can't really call this a special edition, especially after you compare this with Tombstone's double disc pack.
The cast (especially Dennis Quaid) is what makes this film great.  Costner, who traditionally doesn't hold up strong playing legends certainly made one tough gunslinger and a VERY believable Wyatt Earp.  With that moustache, hat, and cold stare, he sure was intimidating!  While Tomstone's cast looked like actors playing cowboys, Wyatt Earp aims for realism and hits its mark dead on.
If you're a fan of this film, then this DVD is definitely worth getting.  However, if you only collect DVDs with a lot of extra glitz, this will be a bit of a letdown.",1085011200,4,1284,4.9672897196261685
622711,3,6303269826,"Saddle up, Costner fans -- ""Wyatt Earp"" has finally made it to DVD.
This epic Western biography bombed in theaters, and on video it's obvious why. The movie is long, long, long. It's best to watch this gigantic movie over a two-day period, stopping at the halfway point and picking up where you left off. ""Wyatt Earp's"" length is its biggest flaw.
I hated the movie the first time I saw it, on a pan-and-scan videotape, but DVD has restored the film's visual glory. Physically, this is a beautiful movie. Some of the shots are so lavishly stunning that we are reminded of the landscapes in ""Dances With Wolves."" This is the ultimate usefulness of the DVD format -- giving old(er) movies back their original beauty.
Costner is better than I remembered in the title role. He does a pretty good job of playing Wyatt from his early 20s to his 60s. He's especially good in the Dodge City sequences, dressed in black, teaching the Mastersons a thing or two about law enforcement. Is he as good as Henry Fonda in ""My Darling Clementine?"" Not quite, but this is not a bad performance by any stretch of the imagination.
The other actors are pretty good, too. Dennis Quaid is strong as Doc Holliday, though Doc really doesn't have that much to do and he has little onscreen chemistry with Costner (I didn't quite buy that these two men were great friends, mostly because Costner's Wyatt is so stand-offish.) Tom Sizemore, Michael Madsen and Bill Pullman also lend strong support. This being very much a guy movie, the female characters don't come off as well and are given scant notice, though Catherine O'Hara earns some praise as Allie Earp.
The movie's extreme length, though, almost kills it. ""Wyatt Earp"" could have used tighter editing and a stronger, more focused story. It does have some good action scenes, and the gunfight at the OK Corral is well handled. Unfortunately, the movie seems to be building toward nothing. I'm surprised it didn't carry us all the way to Wyatt's deathbed scene.
Still, I respect the movie; it's an impressive Western, and I'm glad to have it on DVD at last. And it's far from being the worst of Kevin Costner's movies.",1085011200,,2147,4.682539682539683

One review mentioned that there was longer version of this movie on VHS.  That version is on this DVD BUT it is under the 'lifted scenes' so you get the same movie but split as what is essentially deleted scenes.  A great movie(it's hard to mess up a western) but the DVD was a slight letdown.

622713,5,6303269826,"Clearly there is plenty of debate over which is better--Wyatt Earp or Tombstone.  Those of you who enjoy splashy hollywood fluff and don't care to think, stick to the latter.  The former, on the other hand, is one of the greatest modern westerns available--no doubt in a league including Open Range and Unforgiven--showing the heroic mythical figure along with the ""warts and all"" realistic character that was more likely.
Although it is certainly longer than Tombstone, I don't think this takes away from Wyatt Earp.  Rather the subtle character touches, the incredible cinematography, and overwhelmingly stunning soundtrack by James Newton Howard make this film something of a wonder to watch and listen to.  Kevin Costner is magnetic as a heroic character who has the ultimate flaw of being a man of his times--a scoundrel and womanizer who puts himself and his family first.  Dennis Quaid is equally convincing and intense as Doc Holliday, Earp's skeletal side-kick.

622714,5,6303269826,"Despite much harsh criticism this film endured upon its June 1994 theatrical release, it's a pleasure to see WYATT EARP garnering the attenion it has always deserved. Those who voted it a lost cause a decade ago due to disappointing box office results surely did not expect the popularity this film later earned on the home video and cable television markets, thus exposing it to a much broader audience. Originally developed by Kevin Costner and his producing partner Jim Wilson to be a large-scale cable television mini-series for HBO or Showtime, Costner's longtime friend Lawrence Kasdan stepped in and revamped it as a full-scale motion picture epic, compressing the project in mind a little bit for better interpretation on a wider canvas. With vast landscapes, a stellar cast, lush cinematography and produced with a passion not only for the genre, but for old school epic filmmaking, WYATT EARP is a superb film that deserves its still-growing attention and accolades. Unlike the so-so comic book-esque TOMBSTONE, WYATT EARP tells the real story and takes its time doing so. The result is an unforgettable motion picture experience that you will surely watch again and again. I am very happy that Warner Brothers decided to include on the 2-disc set not only a brand new feature-length documentary, but a little gem of a documentary called ""Wyatt Earp: Walk With A Legend"" that originally aired on CBS in 1994 the night before the film was released theatrically. I was hoping they would include that featurette so I could retire my aging video copy recorded ten years ago.

Not only that, but the cover art (which was the movie poster) is one of the most beautiful pieces of wild west art I have ever seen. I own the poster for that reason.
Many did not like this movie, as it came out 6 months after the more flambouyant Tombstone.  But this one is the real deal.  It is painstakingly historically accurate and has a keen attention to detail.
I loved this movie from the first time I saw it, and own the directors cut VHS (let's hope this release is that cut as well).
It is an acquired taste for sure, but do give it a chance.  Some fine acting all around for an amazing cast that includes: Tom Sizemore, Bill Pullman, Mark Harmon, Gene Hackman, (a young pre-Jesus) Jim Caviesel and Tia Leon -- many in early roles before bigger careers. Hackman as Earp father is as always amazing.  And Dennis Quad's Doc Holliday shines. Costner gives a wholly unlovable portrayl as Wyatt (which may have turned some off -- not liking the main character is not always good for films), but he gives us a deeply layered man with a haunting past and a lot of guilt.
Kasdan as director gives his best here, and you can tell he loves the genre.
The real pity here is that this isn't the directors cut like the VHS I have.  I would rather have that on DVD rather than the extra scenes taken out of the context of the movie.  If only there was a way to play the movie with or without those scenes like the choice of the ABYSS DVD of the theatrical release and the fuller directors release.

I have read almost every book about Wyatt Earp and have visted the town of Tombstone 9 times in as many years. This movie is a pretty accurate portrayl of that man and to now have it finally come out on DVD is a long overdue achievement. Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid (Doc Holliday) do a superb job, although the supporting cast has a lot to be desired. This movie differs from the movie ""Tombstone"", in that it portrays a lot of Wyatt's life from being a teenager during the Civil War to his and Josie's adventure to the Alaskan gold fields near the turn of the century. ""Tombstone"" deals primarily with the happenings in Wyatt's life in that one town, which ironically dealt with less than 2 years of his long adventurous life. I liked this film because it dealt with an approximate 35 year time span of Wyatt's life, and the movie is long enough to dipict this. There are a lot of historical accuracies in the movie which include proper representations of people, places and dialogue such as what is said on the way to and during the gunfight. The inaccuracies are easily overlooked such as Virgil being shot in the wrong arm and the reference to ""Johnny behind the Duece"" as ""Tommy."" All in all though, an excellent film about the life of a great man, Wyatt Earp.  This will be remembered as a classic.",1079481600,4,1434,4.428030303030303

Costner gives an understated performance much in the vein of Henry Fonda.  His Wyatt is a cold and hardened individual especially after the death of his brother Morgan.  Most of the violence is presented in a very matter of fact kind of way.  Although there are plenty of romanticized aspects to this film, a large part of Wyatt Earp rings true.

622738,5,6303269826,"Have to say I thoroughly enjoyed Laurence Kasden's film, which goes further than any other in it's dramatisation of the life and times of Wyatt Earp.
Kevin Costner, in the title role, is perfectly cast, aging from Earp's younger days into old age.  The performance is notable in it's gradual changing and mood from a care free, wild individual to a middle aged and hardened man - and ultimately into a serious, but thoughtful Wyatt Earp at the conclusion.  It must be said that Denis Quaid's incredible Doc Holiday outdoes all the rest.  The viewer has to look twice to recognise that it is indeed Denis Quaid playing the role.  The Actor had lost so much weight for the part, that he looks like the dying gunfighter and gambler one would expect, suffering from TB, in a portrayal which no other actor, including Victor Mature, Kirk Douglas and more recently Val Kilmer, can compete with.  His Southern accent is also flawless.  He also paints Holiday in a more caring light then before, less self centred, but no less capable of violence.
The movie itself, with a running time of over three and a half hours, is a relatively factual chronicle of the life of the mythical Lawman, and of his complicated relationships with his brothers and their wives, and of the hardships that shaped and moulded him.  He comes across as a very deliberate person, but also very cold and ultimately inconsiderate, as well as being heroic and the paragon of justice.  One thinks of Burt Lancaster as Earp in ""Gunfight at the OK Corral"", but it is rather Lancaster's role in Michael Winner's ""Lawman"", that Costner evokes in his role.  The notion of ""when the legend becomes fact, print the legend"" from 'The Man Who shot Libery Valance', is also brought to mind at the conclusion with the re-telling of the Tommy O' Rourke legend. The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent with Gene Hackman perfect as the Paternalistic mentor of the Earp familly. The whole conflict between the Clanton and McLowery clans is more clearly examined, although they don't dominate proceedings in the way that Walter Brennan  as Ike Clanton did in ""My Darling Clemintine""  It's also nice to see Karen Grassle in a small part, along with Bill Pullman, Tim Sizemore and Jobeth Williams. Mare Winningham is also notable in her role as the tragic prostitute who assumes Earp's name in the vain hope that some day he would love her and marry her, and Issabella Rossalini plays Doc Holiday's Kate, tempestuous and attractive, but violent and hard. This edition is presented in it's full widescreen aspect, and is best viewed as such, taking in the wide prarie vistas, and detailed railroad scenes.

For example one scene where he confronts a group of bad
men on the street...he pulls his gun and points it at the
head of the leader and makes a threat to blow his head off
if they don't all back off!
..hogwash!!! Bat Masterson said Wyatt
never pulled his gun unless there was no other course of
action he could take..in this situation Wyatt would (and
often did) grab the bad guy's right hand with his left
hand (preventing him from drawing his gun) and then with
his other hand draw his pistol and use the barrel like a
night stick hitting the guy across the forehead.
Next he would grab the stunned man by the ear and drag
him off to jail. Anyway Hollywood likes to make things
look dramatic..however I would think it would take a lot of
courage to quickly disarm a man the way Wyatt often did.

The crux of Costner's performance is that he anchors the film.  As a producer, he helped give this motion picture artistic direction, and as an actor, he is the keystone of the production.  Granted, Dennis Quaid is tremendous as Doc Holliday.  Still, Costner's stage presense in the film give it a great deal of its depth.  This is one of Costner's best performances, due largely to his success in portraying Wyatt Earp as a man who was motivated and governed by his own internal code, rather than the hardships that continually confronted him.
(Beware:  Plot Spoilers ahead!)  We follow Wyatt Earp from his boyhood days learning life's lessons from his lawyer father, here protrayed by Gene Hackman.  We see Earp enduring the death of his first wife Verilla from Typhoid (watch for the mom from ""Little House on the Prairie"" portraying Verilla's mother).  Earp falls into despair, attempting to drown his sorrows in alcohol.  He descends into a criminal existence, only to be incarcerated as a horse thief.  He is rescued by his father and journeys west, where he, almost by accident, is drawn into the life of a lawman in Dodge City.
What is most compeling about Costner's portrayal of Wyatt Earp is how his character evolves through his confrontations with outlaws.  He begins the film as an idealistic, adventurous young man who is at heart a romantic.  The tragedy of his first wife's death, coupled with his continual confrontations with ruthless outlaws, causes a profound shift from youthful exuberance to cold, tough survivalism.  Earp depends on the enforcement of the law, because in the old west that's all there was to depend upon.  Costner successfully portrays Earp's abandonment of his youthful ideals as his reputation as a lawman grows.
It is not until Earp finds love again that his inner self appears to be reawakened; this is portrayed in a believeable, if not overly emotional fashion.
As aforementioned, it is Costner's stage presense that gives this film its anchor.  He presents Earp as a man whose sense of  identity was stronger than the wickedness and lawlessness of his countrymen, and it was this quality that gave Earp what he needed to survive and triumph over the criminals that hounded him continually.  To the film's credit, this facet of Earp's character is not presently overtly, but rather very successfully inferred by Costner's intense portrayal of one of the Old West's most controversial and misunderstood figures.
I strongly recommend this film, particularly to Costner fans.  Just about anyone with an interest in the Old West might find merit in this film, so give it a shot (no pun intended).  You'll be glad you did.
Note:  Watch for Tea Leoni's ""cameo"" as a prostitute attempting to seduce Wyatt during his formative years in the west.  Remember her from ""The Family Man"" with Nick Cage?  She's almost unrecognizeable here.",1055376000,4,3127,4.992277992277992
622765,4,6303269826,"""Wyatt Earp"" tries, in only three hours, to portray fully the broad sweep of the life of a complicated man living in tumultuous times.  In large part it succeeds.  Costner's Earp is well thought out, and beautifully acted. Costner takes us from the young, warm, wide-eyed western newcomer, filled with ambition, who, as personal trials and tragedy follow him, grows ever harder and colder, until he is a match for the hard and cold world in which he lives.  Then he meets Josie, who begins to thaw him out just as he must be harder and colder than ever.  ""Go home, Josie,"" he tells her at the critical moment, ""thinking about you could get me killed.""  He doesn't get killed, of course; despite the thaw, when he must, he rises to the challenge.  Thinking that such events are behind him, more tragedy befalls him, and he finds more demands fall on him--horrible and difficult demands--before he can again warm to Josie's love.  Costner captures all this perfectly.
Dennis Quade's performance as Doc Holliday nothing short of astounding.  Quade is transformed; he IS Doc.  This is surely the closest we'll ever come to seeing the actual man.  He perfectly captures the acerbic, resent-filled Holiday, condemend to an early death by disease, trying to cheat his comsumption through reckless, fatal confrontations.  His caustic wit and belligerent personality have driven away anyone who might be his friend--everyone but Wyatt.  This is surely one of the oddest friendships, and difficult to understand.  In the scene where they meet, Doc laments that he will never see his native Georgia again.  ""I'm sorry"" says Wyatt.  Quade's Doc's eyes flash as they jerk up to study Earp; he's clearly ready to fly into a homicidal rage if he detects the least falseness.  But his glare is met by Costner's steady, unflinching, guileless stare.  Doc seems surprised, then pleased, in a roundabout way he proposes they be friends and extends his hand to Earp.  Nothing more is needed to explain the odd friendship between the two men.  It's a richly textured scene with many layers of understanding, perfectly acted by Quade and Costner--who both obviously understand their characters.
Historically accurate?  No.  His brothers never worked as lawmen in Dodge; Doc was merely grazed on the hip at the famous gunfight and never left his feet; only Morgan, among the Earp party, was down when the shooting stopped; Wyatt never stole a horse--at least in the way portrayed in the film; and much more.  But ""Wyatt Earp"" is certainly much more true to history than any other movie about Earp.  We can forgive the dramatic digressions because there is so much that goes far in telling the history.
It's long, but it needs to be.  I found no part of it dull--though some scenes could have had better pacing.  It is one of my favorite movies.  I watch it over and over, and I enjoy it each time.  I join the chorus asking for it to appear on DVD.",1039910400,9,2925,4.798

Kevin Costner, Dennis Quaid and all the others made such a big effort to the filmgoers to show us how it was in those days and when you watched it it was really like we were back in the cowboy time.

Kevin Costner was even colder than usual (as in ""For the Love of the Game""), an expressionless look on his face for much of the movie, but anything else would not have done justice to the character.  The supporting cast was unremarkable, but Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday was incredible...in my opinion, he stole the show and deserved much more screen time.  While many of the Earp brothers (excluding Wyatt, of course) were faceless and often difficult if not impossible to tell apart, Quaid captured Doc Holliday's character in every action--speaking, riding, making one of those cynical and hilarious one-liners (Like when Wyatt confides in Doc that he is his closest friend, and Holliday replies, after a long silence, ""Shut up,"" or when he comments that Wyatt wants to be a lawman and an outlaw, getting ""the best of both worlds."").  It took me a considerable amount of time, at least an hour, to finally believe the video case and conclude that Doc Holliday was in fact played by Dennis Quaid.  How did that large, handsome, all-american actor from ""Frequency"" manage to pull off a skinny, dying man?  And that voice...I loved the voice of Doc Holliday, and would rewind the tape sometimes to listen again.  Rich and deep, it was the only thing that ultimatly conviced me that Holliday was played by Quaid.

The historical aspects of Wyatt Earp's life take a back-seat to an over-dramatized epic. Doc Holliday, who was played to perfection by Val Kilmer in ""Tombstone,"" is played rather stiffly and dull by Dennis Quaid, who has turned in better performances than this (think ""Frequency""). Costner's Earp is too drab, falling not only short of his acting potential (""Thirteen Days""), but he also cannot seem to go one-on-one with Kurt Russell's Earp from ""Tombstone"" (which told the same story without over-playing it). The biggest drab of the movie is the OK Corrall sequence, which takes up only thirty seconds of screen-time, and is not dramatic (Lawerence Kasdan fails to capture the essence of it the way George P. Costamos did for ""Tombstone""). Overall, a pretty good film. But if you want to see a good film about Wyatt Earp and the OK Corrall, think ""Tombstone."" Grade: B",1020211200,,1114,4.77720207253886

""Wyatt Earp"" is  unusually ambitious in this regard for a Hollywood film, and attention to  historical detail was wonderful.

I can even laud the make-up artists who made the 40  something Costner look believably youthful for his  scenes as Wyatt Earp in  his 20's.

Along the way he meets his calling as a lawman.  But  irrespective of the legend we are introduced to a man with many of the same  shortcomings as us all in addition to his many virtues.
I have been  drawn to this film again and again although it is at times slow moving and  at others seemingly pointless.  Of particular interest to me are the scenes  after he becomes a deputy until we see him as a retiree.  In those we see a  man of many different motivations and loyalties.
