2958943,3,B000W04RWK,"as a rabid hockey fan, i pretty much knew what to expect going in, history wise. however, i was disappointed with the lack of interaction the rocket had with his hall of fame brethren- very few even have speaking roles. elmer lach has, i think, three lines. but, the on ice re-creations are spectacular, particularly the climactic scene that spurred the infamous riot, and worth the price alone. ""the rocket"" focuses less on the on ice heroics and locker room life of the man, and instead focuses primarily on franco-anglo tensions of the era in quebec. overall, not bad, but not that great either.",1202428800,2,598,4.759615384615385
2958944,5,B000W04RWK,"There are only a handful of sports-related movies that rank among my favorite all-time movies of any genre. The Rocket is among them. It tells the story of ""The Rocket,"" Maurice Richard. There are a couple of levels that should interest virtually anyone, hockey fan or not.

First, the film is nicely directed. There are some angles of Richard's life that were left completely out of this film, but that is understandable since the movie clocks in at a little over two hours. Every scene in the movie has a purpose, which means the movie never drags. Also, the re-creation of some of the scenes are painstakingly faithful to what happened in reality. I have seen a good deal of actual footage from some of the games and events in the movie. It is incredible how accurate the movie version of the scenes parallel the actual footage. It also doesn't hurt that the actor who portrays Richard looks strikingly like the real deal.

Second, the story itself is just plain inspirational and uplifting. Richard transcended sport in becoming a hero to the people of Quebec that went beyond the ice. He helped instill a sense of pride at a time in which French-speaking people in Canada were not having an easy time. Persistence, toughness, patience, and courage are a few of the words that can best describe Maurice Richard. All of these characteristics are brought out well in the film.

The Rocket is the perfect movie to show a young hockey player or athlete to help them understand that a person should never give up on their dreams. It also demonstrates that people should not back down in the face of injustice. I give this movie my highest recommendation.",1200960000,8,1653,4.71280276816609
2958945,2,B000W04RWK,This movie could have been about 30 minutes shorter. The movie is beautifully filmed but the lead actor is never happy about anything. The French Canadien prejudice angle comes across pretty weak also. It's also hard to pull for the guy punching the ref and whacking another player with a stick (in reality there was a delayed penalty called on the play that took the Rocket out and it wasn't the 1st time the Rocket hit a player with his stick).Only for the hard core hockey fan.,1200873600,3,480,4.528735632183908
2958946,5,B000W04RWK,I bought this DVD for my husband for Christmas because he is a big fan of the Montreal Canadiens.  He and my 13-year old son loved the movie and said that they could watch it over and over again.,1200009600,,195,4.0
2958947,5,B000W04RWK,"Note: French and English with English subtitles.

The '05 film `The Rocket' is a long overdue cinematic biography of the greatest hockey player and icon in NHL history. More than just a sports film, the story of Maurice Richard is a story exposing the corruption and brutality of the sport as it was in the ""Golden Age"" of hockey and the overt bias throughout the league against the French speaking players in general and the Montreal Canadiens specifically. In the forties and fifties it was literally Montreal against the world and Maurice was the one player with the ability and fierce tenacity to take on all the inequities thrown his way and become a legend in his own time.

I found the film to be absolutely riveting. The production values and acting is excellent and the dialogue insightful and realistic. Roy Dupuis was perfect in the role of Maurice as was Lucille LeBreton as his adoring and supportive wife Lucille. Even if you're not a hockey fan the film has much to teach about the era and more than hints to the reasons as to why there is so much internal strife between French and English speaking Canada to this day.

My highest recommendation: -5 Stars-.",1198454400,28,1173,4.684466019417476
2958948,5,B000W04RWK,"It may be hard to imagine today but in 1937 the NHL consisted of 6 teams and was on the verge of folding. It desperately needed a hero. Working as a machinist in a factory was a young French-Canadian named Maurice Richard with dreams of playing in the NHL. When he finally earned a tryout with the Montreal Canadiens, he had already suffered one serious injury, and despite an impressive tryout, the owners did not want to take a chance. The coach took a hard line stance in favor of the young Maurice and got him on the team. He soon proved the owners right by getting injured again. It took some incredibly hard rehabilitation as well as enduring some brutal attacks by teammates who were testing him to convince the owners to give him another chance. So began the career of, arguably, the most loved and well known Montreal Canadien ever. He has been called the 'Babe Ruth of hockey'. In some ways, he was more like Jackie Robinson. French-Canadians had about the same status as African-Americans in the U.S. Although not the first F-C to play in the NHL, his success and popularity threatened the status quo. Despite scoring 50 goals in 50 games, he didn't win the scorng title because the teams conspired against him to the point of awarding assists to players not even on the ice to build up their point totals. As an aside, F-C fans even had to sit in a segregated section of the arena which was enclosed by a chain link fence. Not only is this an entertaining and inspiring hockey movie but it's a great education for someone not familiar with the history of Quebec and the fight for equality by the French Canadians.

2959005,4,B000W04RWK,"I saw this YouTube clip some time ago about an old, long retired hockey player named Maurice ""The Rocket"" Richard who received such an extended standing ovation at the Montreal Forum's final game played that it got me almighty curious about him. I'm at best a very casual hockey fan, and even though I'd heard of his name somewhen before, I was taken aback by the Rocket's accomplishments on ice. First player in the National Hockey League to score 50 goals in 50 games. First to score 500 goals in a career. Left the sport as the NHL's then all-time leading scorer. Won the Stanley Cup eight times with the Montreal Canadiens. All of that and more are touched on in THE ROCKET - The Legend of Rocket Richard, an absorbing biopic drama about one of professional hockey's most celebrated icons.

The Rocket's heyday was in the 1940s and '50s, during the raucous pre-helmet era, when multi-million dollar contracts were these fanciful castles in the air. Like every other blue-collar pro athlete, Maurice Richard had a day job. His was that of a factory machinist. There's an authenticity to the film's evocation of old Montreal, a backdrop that punctuates Richard's
common man roots and also the casual discrimination that flavored the behavior of them folks what thought they were better than those lowly French-Canadians, of which Richard was one. ""Pea Soup!"" he was called, this a derogatory slang derived from World War I when the French-Canadian troops were regularly fed pea soup. Thanks for that trivia, the Internet.

We see how tough it was for Richard, playing like a god, treated like a second-class citizen. He was the only star player whom the league didn't protect. The deeper into the film, the more caught up I got. The Rocket was such an underdog. He never started a fight but never backed down from one, either. He tried to enlist twice but was turned down both times as unfit for active duty on account of his being too fragile. When he was seriously injured early in his career, the voices on the radio were quick to dismiss him: ""We knew he was frail. It seems the Canadiens signed a lemon... a lemon that's easily crushed."" And then peep this sports headline: ""Les Canadiens cherchent des joueurs pour remplacer Richard et Charlie Sands."" Now I don't know what that all meant, but I figure it couldn't have been good for the Rocket. Or for Charlie Sands.

Roy Dupuis plays the legend with conviction, plays him with grit and endearing sincerity. Word has it that the Rocket was a stoic mother, not one to open up, and thus not giving Dupuis much to work with. So credit the actor for making his character relatable. I'm not as devoted a hockey fan as I wish I were, and I don't know how far-ranging of an impact Richard actually had as a symbol of the French-speaking underclass in Canada, them Habs, them Pea Soups. I don't know how much he contributed in breaking down the racial barriers in Quebec. He put his thoughts down in an ongoing newspaper column, disclosing the occasional hard-hitting opinion. And even a guy who keeps things close to the vest has a tipping point. Fed up with the rampant discrimination set against him, he acts out against a linesman, decks him proper, lays him out. He gets suspended for the remaining of the season. Cue the ensuing riot on the streets. Seeking more dramatic beats, maybe the film exagerrates Richard's role in the social reform front. Or maybe not. I'm no Habs historian. Certainly, if you go by that helluva extended ovation in that YouTube clip, you can't doubt how beloved of a figure the Rocket is.

The film recreates several of Richard's amazing exploits on ice, including his scoring a goal while Red Wings defenseman Earl Siebert piggybacked him, and also his brother-in-law's notorious bet against the Rocket's scoring a goal because he had spent most of that day moving to a new house. Richard ended up scoring five goals and three assists in that game. And, as in another crowd-pleasing biopic, STAND AND DELIVER, as the screen fades to black, we read what happens to our character past the movie's timeline. My jaw gaped and then I cheered. You do that when you learn something amazing.

Stephen McHattie nabs a scene-stealing role as the Montreal Canadiens' steely coach, the one guy who saw potential in an undersized, injury-prone, but very scrappy rookie. Julie Le Breton has the thankless role of playing Richard's wife. She's mostly relegated to wringing her hands and worrying about the persistent abuse her husband undergoes on ice. I do wish that we'd seen more of Richard's interacting with his teammates. Instead, the impression left is that while the Rocket was a well-respected teammate, he wasn't exactly well-loved. Most times, he's depicted as this isolated figure, even in a crowded locker room. But probably he was like that in real life, in which case props to the film for achieving another smidge of authenticity. Whatever. What I know is that this is a movie that compels the viewer's attention. The action on the ice is excitingly staged. Roy Dupuis is a whirling dervish. In fact, when the focus is on Richard as the relentless on-ice phenom, the movie is vastly entertaining. When he's presented as a crusader for the social underclass, well, I don't know that the story sells that so convincingly. But this is a must-see film, even for hockey non-enthusiasts.

The film can be viewed either in its original French language (with the option for English sub-titles) or in English dub. The DVD's bonus stuff:

- ""A Tribute to Maurice Richard, The Rocket"" (00:22:45 minutes, in French but with English sub-titles)
- 12 Deleted Scenes (totaling 00:06:15 minutes, French audio commentary with English sub-titles)
- U.S. Theatrical Trailer",1375315200,2,5741,4.822335025380711
2959006,2,B000W04RWK,"The Rocket is best when it tells the story of Maurice Richard on the ice. There are some fantastically realistic recreations of great Rocket moments, complete with period lighting and historic snap shots. You could not have picked a better actor for the Richard role; Roy Dupuis is simply perfection, both on the ice and off. Stephen McHattie, as the hard nosed coach Dick Irvin, is also a joy to watch act (and boy oh boy, did Irvin ride Richard!) Not so for Rmy Girard, the otherwise always memorable actor, who's barber character is nothing more than a platitudinous plot device.

You see, the problem with this movie is that its sort of half of a movie. Or half of an interesting one. Why? Well, like another famous and contemporary athlete, Joe Louis, off the ice Maurice Richard isn't all that interesting or compelling. There is simply no fudging this.

What the movie tries to do, and you can't blame the writers given the oft retold popular cultural history, is link Richard's life with the ""Quiet Revolution"" and nationalism (and separatism) in Qubec. This really doesn't wash, is explored in some pretty hammy vignettes, and is not true anyways. Actually, Qubcois historians have argued that Richard's role in this movement has been grossly exaggerated over time, and while certainly news worthy (and entertaining in the ""rear view mirror"" of history) it just ain't what happened.

Which means that about half of this movie is a dud. And you can't watch the other half without it.",1370736000,4,1491,4.8392156862745095

2959023,5,B000W04RWK,"The Rocket is an excellent movie that combines both the story of Maurice Richard and the Montreal Canadiens with the subtext of racial and cultural bias against French Canadians in the 1950's NHL. I really enjoyed the portrayal of Maurice Richard as both star player and firebrand against a system mired in blind injustice. The Rocket is set in a time before mine so I cannot verify it's period correctness, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The hockey sequences were action packed, the moral was not overbearing, and the characters really looked the part. The movie was neither sappy nor schlocky, but a great mix of sport and history. Richard's approach to standing up for his rights and demanding respect from the NHL is much like his powerful drives to the net: Down the right side and straight in your face.

2959024,5,B000W04RWK,"I rented this movie a couple of years ago and wanted to own my own copy because I find it inspiring.  Maurice Richard is the Gary Cooper of hockey, a man of few words, a man of action, and a man who keeps it simple.  He loves hockey, he loves his wife and family.  He works hard, practices long hours, suffers quietly through physical injuries and injustice, and yet the man of few words speaks out through a sportswriter, trying to protect his fellow French-Canadian players from unnecessary physical harm.  Like Jackie Robinson, he suffered much, and mostly in silence.  He is an inspiration to many, yet it took a physical and emotional toll on him and his family.  I like this movie because none of this seemed heavy-handed but was woven into a story about a young man and an adult who, through perseverance and unfailing hope, is able to play a game that he loves to play and wins because he loves to win.",1321747200,,910,4.451807228915663

Unless u r a hockey fan, and understand how the game was played years and years ago, along with minimal salaries, you really can't understand and appreciate what it was like during that hockey era.  I thought the movie depicted very accurate incidents of what really happened during that period.  Roy Dupuis played an awesome character of the late Maurice ""Rocket"" Richard and showed true grit and character in his battle to make it in the big leagues.  Having difficulty proving himself at times to coaches and peers ""Rocket Richard"" exploded into the Hall of Fame spotlight because of his true love and passion for the game.  An awesome film from beginning to end depicting his life story showing the rough times and glory days of his career.

I have heard people praise the action shots in Miracle, but you will agree that it was nowhere near as close to the action in this movie.

It brought back wonderful memories of the times my father would take me to the games at the Maple Leaf Gardens. A Toronto Maple Leafs fan for sure, but Montreal was a very close second. No other game at the Gardens matched the rivalry and intensity that was created when Montreal came to town. And to sit and be awed at watching the greatest of all hockey players. Very few, even by todays standards, could take a puck from his own end and burn his was up the ice with nobody touching him let alone stopping him. It was pure hockey poetry in motion.

A truly great movie that showed the frustration of his life both on and off the ice. A movie that I will never tire of watching over and over again. Because every time I watch it, I will be brought back to the Gardens when I had the thrill of watching him play. Maurice Richard...the greatest of hockey players. There will never be and has never been a player to match him as far as I'm concerned...even the great Gretsky. A 10 minute standing ovation is further proof of that when fans, particularily French Canadian fans, had an opportunity to give back to him for all what he gave to them.

2959038,4,B000W04RWK,"I am not one at all, and know very little about the history of the NHL. Maurice Richard was a name to me like other vaguely heard names, Bill Tilden or Bronco Nagurski or Babe Zaharias Didrikson. I know all these athletes have interesting and important stories, but I have never investigated them, so they remain basically unknown.

What prompted my wife to pick this film up, I cannot imagine. She has no interest in hockey, and nearly no interest in sports. But fortunately she did, as it is not a film about sport. It is a film about people, and the transformation of one man from suppressed bystander who allows injustice to go unremarked to vocal critic who stands up for right when wrong holds all the cards.

The Maurice Richard in this film is a quiet man, a loner, and a bit fearful. But he is possessed by a burning drive and a hunger that makes him nearly unstoppable as a competitor. We see him rebuffed when he seeks permission to marry, and then we cut to wedding photographs. So though he appears ineffectual, he gets things done.

When he decides to get things done off the rink, his world changes. I was riveted by the action and the story. The few complaints in here seem off target to me; I believed in this man and his life, his wife and his coach. Excellent acting, great photography, bad guys to hate. What more could you want? This is a beautifully made film, exciting and well filmed hockey action wonderfully blended with spot-on recreations of life in this time and place. I was constantly amazed at the detail and look. Athletes may have been loved, but they still lived something like normal lives.

Tough and taciturn, he endured discrimination because he was French-Canadian, and physical attacks from opposing players.  He became a hero to hockey fans and fellow French-Canadians during his long and illustrious career with the Montreal Canadiens.  I listened to many of his games on the radio when I was growing up, but had no idea of the social and racial hurdles he faced in his life.

3193441,5,B000W04RWK,"There are only a handful of sports-related movies that rank among my favorite all-time movies of any genre. The Rocket is among them. It tells the story of ""The Rocket,"" Maurice Richard. There are a couple of levels that should interest virtually anyone, hockey fan or not.

First, the film is nicely directed. There are some angles of Richard's life that were left completely out of this film, but that is understandable since the movie clocks in at a little over two hours. Every scene in the movie has a purpose, which means the movie never drags. Also, the re-creation of some of the scenes are painstakingly faithful to what happened in reality. I have seen a good deal of actual footage from some of the games and events in the movie. It is incredible how accurate the movie version of the scenes parallel the actual footage. It also doesn't hurt that the actor who portrays Richard looks strikingly like the real deal.

Second, the story itself is just plain inspirational and uplifting. Richard transcended sport in becoming a hero to the people of Quebec that went beyond the ice. He helped instill a sense of pride at a time in which French-speaking people in Canada were not having an easy time. Persistence, toughness, patience, and courage are a few of the words that can best describe Maurice Richard. All of these characteristics are brought out well in the film.

The Rocket is the perfect movie to show a young hockey player or athlete to help them understand that a person should never give up on their dreams. It also demonstrates that people should not back down in the face of injustice. I give this movie my highest recommendation.",1200960000,8,1653,4.71280276816609
3193442,2,B000W04RWK,This movie could have been about 30 minutes shorter. The movie is beautifully filmed but the lead actor is never happy about anything.

It's also hard to pull for the guy punching the ref and whacking another player with a stick (in reality there was a delayed penalty called on the play that took the Rocket out and it wasn't the 1st time the Rocket hit a player with his stick).Only for the hard core hockey fan.,1200873600,3,480,4.528735632183908

3193444,5,B000W04RWK,"Note: French and English with English subtitles.

The '05 film `The Rocket' is a long overdue cinematic biography of the greatest hockey player and icon in NHL history. More than just a sports film, the story of Maurice Richard is a story exposing the corruption and brutality of the sport as it was in the ""Golden Age"" of hockey and the overt bias throughout the league against the French speaking players in general and the Montreal Canadiens specifically. In the forties and fifties it was literally Montreal against the world and Maurice was the one player with the ability and fierce tenacity to take on all the inequities thrown his way and become a legend in his own time.

I found the film to be absolutely riveting. The production values and acting is excellent and the dialogue insightful and realistic. Roy Dupuis was perfect in the role of Maurice as was Lucille LeBreton as his adoring and supportive wife Lucille. Even if you're not a hockey fan the film has much to teach about the era and more than hints to the reasons as to why there is so much internal strife between French and English speaking Canada to this day.

My highest recommendation: -5 Stars-.",1198454400,28,1173,4.684466019417476
3193445,5,B000W04RWK,"It may be hard to imagine today but in 1937 the NHL consisted of 6 teams and was on the verge of folding. It desperately needed a hero. Working as a machinist in a factory was a young French-Canadian named Maurice Richard with dreams of playing in the NHL. When he finally earned a tryout with the Montreal Canadiens, he had already suffered one serious injury, and despite an impressive tryout, the owners did not want to take a chance. The coach took a hard line stance in favor of the young Maurice and got him on the team. He soon proved the owners right by getting injured again. It took some incredibly hard rehabilitation as well as enduring some brutal attacks by teammates who were testing him to convince the owners to give him another chance. So began the career of, arguably, the most loved and well known Montreal Canadien ever. He has been called the 'Babe Ruth of hockey'. In some ways, he was more like Jackie Robinson. French-Canadians had about the same status as African-Americans in the U.S. Although not the first F-C to play in the NHL, his success and popularity threatened the status quo. Despite scoring 50 goals in 50 games, he didn't win the scorng title because the teams conspired against him to the point of awarding assists to players not even on the ice to build up their point totals. As an aside, F-C fans even had to sit in a segregated section of the arena which was enclosed by a chain link fence. Not only is this an entertaining and inspiring hockey movie but it's a great education for someone not familiar with the history of Quebec and the fight for equality by the French Canadians.

3193502,4,B000W04RWK,"I saw this YouTube clip some time ago about an old, long retired hockey player named Maurice ""The Rocket"" Richard who received such an extended standing ovation at the Montreal Forum's final game played that it got me almighty curious about him. I'm at best a very casual hockey fan, and even though I'd heard of his name somewhen before, I was taken aback by the Rocket's accomplishments on ice. First player in the National Hockey League to score 50 goals in 50 games. First to score 500 goals in a career. Left the sport as the NHL's then all-time leading scorer. Won the Stanley Cup eight times with the Montreal Canadiens. All of that and more are touched on in THE ROCKET - The Legend of Rocket Richard, an absorbing biopic drama about one of professional hockey's most celebrated icons.

The Rocket's heyday was in the 1940s and '50s, during the raucous pre-helmet era, when multi-million dollar contracts were these fanciful castles in the air. Like every other blue-collar pro athlete, Maurice Richard had a day job. His was that of a factory machinist. There's an authenticity to the film's evocation of old Montreal, a backdrop that punctuates Richard's
common man roots and also the casual discrimination that flavored the behavior of them folks what thought they were better than those lowly French-Canadians, of which Richard was one. ""Pea Soup!"" he was called, this a derogatory slang derived from World War I when the French-Canadian troops were regularly fed pea soup. Thanks for that trivia, the Internet.

We see how tough it was for Richard, playing like a god, treated like a second-class citizen. He was the only star player whom the league didn't protect. The deeper into the film, the more caught up I got. The Rocket was such an underdog. He never started a fight but never backed down from one, either. He tried to enlist twice but was turned down both times as unfit for active duty on account of his being too fragile. When he was seriously injured early in his career, the voices on the radio were quick to dismiss him: ""We knew he was frail. It seems the Canadiens signed a lemon... a lemon that's easily crushed."" And then peep this sports headline: ""Les Canadiens cherchent des joueurs pour remplacer Richard et Charlie Sands."" Now I don't know what that all meant, but I figure it couldn't have been good for the Rocket. Or for Charlie Sands.

Roy Dupuis plays the legend with conviction, plays him with grit and endearing sincerity. Word has it that the Rocket was a stoic mother, not one to open up, and thus not giving Dupuis much to work with. So credit the actor for making his character relatable. I'm not as devoted a hockey fan as I wish I were, and I don't know how far-ranging of an impact Richard actually had as a symbol of the French-speaking underclass in Canada, them Habs, them Pea Soups. I don't know how much he contributed in breaking down the racial barriers in Quebec. He put his thoughts down in an ongoing newspaper column, disclosing the occasional hard-hitting opinion. And even a guy who keeps things close to the vest has a tipping point. Fed up with the rampant discrimination set against him, he acts out against a linesman, decks him proper, lays him out. He gets suspended for the remaining of the season. Cue the ensuing riot on the streets. Seeking more dramatic beats, maybe the film exagerrates Richard's role in the social reform front. Or maybe not. I'm no Habs historian. Certainly, if you go by that helluva extended ovation in that YouTube clip, you can't doubt how beloved of a figure the Rocket is.

The film recreates several of Richard's amazing exploits on ice, including his scoring a goal while Red Wings defenseman Earl Siebert piggybacked him, and also his brother-in-law's notorious bet against the Rocket's scoring a goal because he had spent most of that day moving to a new house. Richard ended up scoring five goals and three assists in that game. And, as in another crowd-pleasing biopic, STAND AND DELIVER, as the screen fades to black, we read what happens to our character past the movie's timeline. My jaw gaped and then I cheered. You do that when you learn something amazing.

Stephen McHattie nabs a scene-stealing role as the Montreal Canadiens' steely coach, the one guy who saw potential in an undersized, injury-prone, but very scrappy rookie. Julie Le Breton has the thankless role of playing Richard's wife. She's mostly relegated to wringing her hands and worrying about the persistent abuse her husband undergoes on ice. I do wish that we'd seen more of Richard's interacting with his teammates. Instead, the impression left is that while the Rocket was a well-respected teammate, he wasn't exactly well-loved. Most times, he's depicted as this isolated figure, even in a crowded locker room. But probably he was like that in real life, in which case props to the film for achieving another smidge of authenticity. Whatever. What I know is that this is a movie that compels the viewer's attention. The action on the ice is excitingly staged. Roy Dupuis is a whirling dervish. In fact, when the focus is on Richard as the relentless on-ice phenom, the movie is vastly entertaining. When he's presented as a crusader for the social underclass, well, I don't know that the story sells that so convincingly. But this is a must-see film, even for hockey non-enthusiasts.

There are some fantastically realistic recreations of great Rocket moments, complete with period lighting and historic snap shots. You could not have picked a better actor for the Richard role; Roy Dupuis is simply perfection, both on the ice and off. Stephen McHattie, as the hard nosed coach Dick Irvin, is also a joy to watch act (and boy oh boy, did Irvin ride Richard!) Not so for Rmy Girard, the otherwise always memorable actor, who's barber character is nothing more than a platitudinous plot device.

You see, the problem with this movie is that its sort of half of a movie. Or half of an interesting one. Why? Well, like another famous and contemporary athlete, Joe Louis, off the ice Maurice Richard isn't all that interesting or compelling. There is simply no fudging this.

What the movie tries to do, and you can't blame the writers given the oft retold popular cultural history, is link Richard's life with the ""Quiet Revolution"" and nationalism (and separatism) in Qubec. This really doesn't wash, is explored in some pretty hammy vignettes, and is not true anyways. Actually, Qubcois historians have argued that Richard's role in this movement has been grossly exaggerated over time, and while certainly news worthy (and entertaining in the ""rear view mirror"" of history) it just ain't what happened.

Which means that about half of this movie is a dud. And you can't watch the other half without it.",1370736000,4,1491,4.8392156862745095
3193504,4,B000W04RWK,"I liked this movie.  Roy Dupuis was terrific in it; he didn't overdo the acting bit -- it was realistic.  I believed the story as it unfolded, so I enjoyed it very much.  I would definitely recommended it to anyone who loves to see the ordinary guy achieve well deserved success.",1367798400,,279,4.431372549019608
3193505,5,B000W04RWK,Awesome! Love it! I recommend this to everyone because it is awesome! It is a very cool item to have!,1367712000,,101,4.1
3193506,5,B000W04RWK,Maurice Richard truly one of the top three greatest hockey players of all time. The movie to its credit does a splendid job of revealing the Rocket to the world.,1366675200,,161,4.4
3193507,5,B000W04RWK,"For Valentine's Day we decided to watch this exciting movie which has a good blend of romance, violence (who doesn't like to see a hockey fight?) and power struggles. We watched the English version but I would have preferred to have watched this in French with the English subtitles. Still it kept my attention to the end. I'm not much of a sport's fan but for some reason I love hockey. All the actors in this movie were top rate and fully embraced their roles. It was so great to find a movie that both my husband and I could enjoy together.

3193519,5,B000W04RWK,"One of my young son's favorite books is a biography of Maurice Richard.  When I came across this movie, it was a must see for us, especially because it was rated PG.  What a terrific movie!  The story captured most of the famous moments of Richard's career and really captured his tenacity.  The English dubbing was fine and after a few minutes it won't be much of a distraction.  My son loved it and so did I.",1331510400,,410,4.2727272727272725
3193520,5,B000W04RWK,"The Rocket is an excellent movie that combines both the story of Maurice Richard and the Montreal Canadiens with the subtext of racial and cultural bias against French Canadians in the 1950's NHL. I really enjoyed the portrayal of Maurice Richard as both star player and firebrand against a system mired in blind injustice. The Rocket is set in a time before mine so I cannot verify it's period correctness, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The hockey sequences were action packed, the moral was not overbearing, and the characters really looked the part. The movie was neither sappy nor schlocky, but a great mix of sport and history. Richard's approach to standing up for his rights and demanding respect from the NHL is much like his powerful drives to the net: Down the right side and straight in your face. He shoots, he scores!!!",1322956800,,832,4.784722222222222
3193521,5,B000W04RWK,"I rented this movie a couple of years ago and wanted to own my own copy because I find it inspiring.  Maurice Richard is the Gary Cooper of hockey, a man of few words, a man of action, and a man who keeps it simple.  He loves hockey, he loves his wife and family.  He works hard, practices long hours, suffers quietly through physical injuries and injustice, and yet the man of few words speaks out through a sportswriter, trying to protect his fellow French-Canadian players from unnecessary physical harm.  Like Jackie Robinson, he suffered much, and mostly in silence.  He is an inspiration to many, yet it took a physical and emotional toll on him and his family.  I like this movie because none of this seemed heavy-handed but was woven into a story about a young man and an adult who, through perseverance and unfailing hope, is able to play a game that he loves to play and wins because he loves to win.",1321747200,,910,4.451807228915663
3193522,5,B000W04RWK,If you love hockey you will love this movie. If you watch it in English keep in mind that it is dubbed as it is based on the story of a great French Canadian hockey player. I enjoyed it thoroughly.,1319760000,,197,3.95
3193523,5,B000W04RWK,"Overall I thought this movie was very well directed and acted out.  Unless u r a hockey fan, and understand how the game was played years and years ago, along with minimal salaries, you really can't understand and appreciate what it was like during that hockey era.  I thought the movie depicted very accurate incidents of what really happened during that period.  Roy Dupuis played an awesome character of the late Maurice ""Rocket"" Richard and showed true grit and character in his battle to make it in the big leagues.  Having difficulty proving himself at times to coaches and peers ""Rocket Richard"" exploded into the Hall of Fame spotlight because of his true love and passion for the game.  An awesome film from beginning to end depicting his life story showing the rough times and glory days of his career.  Any true hockey fan would definitely appreciate this film for representing one of the greatest of all time in the game of Hockey.  Definitely worth the purchase without even thinking about it.  Great job...well done.",1304208000,,1030,4.845714285714286

A very good story even for those like me who knows nosin about the game, Dupois is great in this film, they could have not picked a very actor for the movie.
You will learn about the history of the region of Canada and will be facinating by Roy Dupois, scenery will remind you of a Xmas Card, such a beautiful region.",1282608000,,454,5.791044776119403
3193526,4,B000W04RWK,"I'm not a hockey fan. But this movie has open a door in the history of the sport. Roy D is excellent. The story was one of power and dedication to corruption of organized sports in the 1950's, not just for Canada but the world. It's a must see movie.",1277769600,,250,4.02
3193527,4,B000W04RWK,"An unexpected nuance in this movie made it more of art than of hockey, but hockey fans will appreciate it for the story and movie fans will appreciate it for it's artful portrayal of what outsiders to the game view as a brutal, crass sport filled with toothless goons. It is a lovely and quiet film that is filled with brutality of body and soul.",1266105600,,346,4.338461538461538
3193528,4,B000W04RWK,"If you are a true hockey fan, this video is a must see.  It tells the story of the Montreal Canadiens Maurice ""The Rocket"" Richard and his struggle to play the game. It is an inside story.  If you think you know the story, you are probably mistaken and should watch and learn.  Acting is great, cinemaphotography goes between  between classic vintage B & W footage and new footage seemlessly. It is spellbinding.",1263686400,,412,4.602739726027397
3193529,5,B000W04RWK,"They didn't just tell the story about Richard's life, they recreated it.  Every detail, from the chain link fence in the old forum to the street scenes keep you enveloped in the 1940s and 50s.  Most importantly, the hockey action is the most realistic of any movie period.  I have heard people praise the action shots in Miracle, but you will agree that it was nowhere near as close to the action in this movie.  McHattie almost steals the show as the fiery coach Dick Irvin.  Dupuis' resemblance to Richard is almost scary.  To Fanatics like myself, Hockey is religion, and cast and crew of The Rocket showed great respect for the game with this detailed masterpiece.",1247356800,,668,4.666666666666667
3193530,4,B000W04RWK,This was a good movie whether you're a hockey fan or not.  It was a great story and the detail in making it seem like it was really in the 1950's was unparalleled.,1238457600,,163,3.9393939393939394

3193532,5,B000W04RWK,The Rocket was a great depiction of what it's like being a French Canadian and the discrimination that went with that. He was a great hockey player who had to overcome prejudice and jeering because his English wasn't very good. There are fine hockey moments depicted in this film and it's a must see for all hockey fans. Very well written and very well performed.,1220832000,,363,4.6
3193533,5,B000W04RWK,"As a young boy growing up in Toronto, watching this movie gave me goose bumps. It brought back wonderful memories of the times my father would take me to the games at the Maple Leaf Gardens. A Toronto Maple Leafs fan for sure, but Montreal was a very close second. No other game at the Gardens matched the rivalry and intensity that was created when Montreal came to town. And to sit and be awed at watching the greatest of all hockey players. Very few, even by todays standards, could take a puck from his own end and burn his was up the ice with nobody touching him let alone stopping him. It was pure hockey poetry in motion.

A truly great movie that showed the frustration of his life both on and off the ice. A movie that I will never tire of watching over and over again. Because every time I watch it, I will be brought back to the Gardens when I had the thrill of watching him play. Maurice Richard...the greatest of hockey players. There will never be and has never been a player to match him as far as I'm concerned...even the great Gretsky. A 10 minute standing ovation is further proof of that when fans, particularily French Canadian fans, had an opportunity to give back to him for all what he gave to them. A great hockey player and a great man.",1208995200,,1261,4.298319327731092
3193534,5,B000W04RWK,This was a great movie. This was an eye opener for me. It helped me understand more about the NHL in 1940s and 50s. A great movie for youngsters.,1208131200,,145,4.0344827586206895
3193535,4,B000W04RWK,"I am not one at all, and know very little about the history of the NHL. Maurice Richard was a name to me like other vaguely heard names, Bill Tilden or Bronco Nagurski or Babe Zaharias Didrikson. I know all these athletes have interesting and important stories, but I have never investigated them, so they remain basically unknown.

What prompted my wife to pick this film up, I cannot imagine. She has no interest in hockey, and nearly no interest in sports. But fortunately she did, as it is not a film about sport. It is a film about people, and the transformation of one man from suppressed bystander who allows injustice to go unremarked to vocal critic who stands up for right when wrong holds all the cards.

The Maurice Richard in this film is a quiet man, a loner, and a bit fearful. But he is possessed by a burning drive and a hunger that makes him nearly unstoppable as a competitor. We see him rebuffed when he seeks permission to marry, and then we cut to wedding photographs. So though he appears ineffectual, he gets things done.

When he decides to get things done off the rink, his world changes. I was riveted by the action and the story. The few complaints in here seem off target to me; I believed in this man and his life, his wife and his coach. Excellent acting, great photography, bad guys to hate. What more could you want? This is a beautifully made film, exciting and well filmed hockey action wonderfully blended with spot-on recreations of life in this time and place. I was constantly amazed at the detail and look. Athletes may have been loved, but they still lived something like normal lives.

I enjoyed my evening immensely. A story I knew nothing about presented well.",1206748800,2,1704,4.54071661237785

3193537,4,B000W04RWK,"Maurice ""Rocket"" Richard had one of the most successful and enduring careers of anyone in the history of the NHL.  He began as a factory worker, but eventually got his chance to play professional hockey and he made the most of it.  Tough and taciturn, he endured discrimination because he was French-Canadian, and physical attacks from opposing players.  He became a hero to hockey fans and fellow French-Canadians during his long and illustrious career with the Montreal Canadiens.  I listened to many of his games on the radio when I was growing up, but had no idea of the social and racial hurdles he faced in his life.
