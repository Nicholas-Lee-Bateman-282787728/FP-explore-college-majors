However, in the end we have a very interesting and engaging Fidelio.  I recommend this to those who are familiar with Fidelio and already have a good production on DVD (such as the one conducted by Bernstein featuring Gundula Janowitz).  In most cases the singers are dubbed in to actors. In the case of Leonore, there are three women: one to act, one to sing, and one to do the spoken parts. The thought parts are sung but the actors don't lip sync those parts to show they are thoughts.

The movie starts with the Fidelio overture and scenes in the countryside leading to an old castle/fort. After the overture is a scene without music where food it brought to the prisoners. This is followed by Marzeline's aria and there is not duet between Jaquino and Marzelline. This is followed by some spoken parts and then the quartet. A man then opens the window and shouts into the house that the governor is coming. Everyone jumps into action to get ready, and many of the people at the castle/fort go hide to avoid the governor. Pizarro reads his warning note and goes directly into the duet with Rocco to gain help in carrying out the murder. Then Pizarro ascends a tower and sings his aria with storm and flood scenes flashing by. After the prisoners are let out and then returned to their cells, the music for Act II begins as Rocco and Fidelio descend to the dungeon.

In Florestan's aria he sees a vision of Leonore in a dress on a grassy hill. She walks to him and touches his outstretched hands and his chains fall off. Then he falls back to the dungeon floor as Rocco and Fidelio enter. Act II seems to be pretty much intact and has a lot of good acting with emotion from Leonore. After Leonore and Florestan's duet, we enter into the finale. An interesting twist in the finale is that the last 5 minutes switches from the prison courtyard to evening in town, with Florestan and Leonore all cleaned up (Florestan shaved) and dressed up for the celebration, where they are paraded through town with the celebrants.

The glimpses of Leonore as a lady in a dress (one earlier in the film, one in Florestan's aria, and the last 5 minutes of the finale), reveal her vulnerability and give a deeper sense of awe at what this lady has done to free her husband.

While this has some quirks and some cheesy film effects (that were probably pretty cool at the time it was made), I really liked this production. Some voices were pretty good, Rocco and Pizarro in particular, and all the actors were good. I especially like Leonore in this. She played the part well, and her vocals are fine but for the high notes because the person singing for her has a squeaky voice on the high notes that seemed out of place for an otherwise solid Leonore.

The part where Leonore guesses that the man in the dungeon must be a great criminal and Rocco responds that or he may have great enemies is changed. In this movie, it is Marzelline who suggests he must have been a great criminal, and it is Leonore who suggests that he may have great enemies.",1442016000,,3165,4.463667820069205
8374710,5,B002N5KDWA,"Having bought every DVD available of ""Fidelio"" and viewed them, my initial reaction to this 1956 black and white movie was not good. However, I went back and viewed it again yesterday(12-28-2014), and to my huge surprise I really enjoyed it. Being a movie, it took liberty with the ""stage"" libretto, removing some parts and changing the order of some scenes. The overall effect yields quite a logical story line, and actually made me better understand the ""staged"" opera.
I recommend for you to view this film after viewing say the 1978 Otto Schenk version of ""Fidelio"".
BTW. You must click on the subtitle TWICE, in order for it to appear. Once in the first screen, a second time in the screen for starting the film. (Go pass it to the last choice for subtitles.)",1419811200,,764,4.666666666666667
