2470425,4,B000CR7J3M,"This is the best version of Heidi in my opinion, true to the story, wonderfully cast, and and with a very authentic-looking setting. Its only real flaw is that this DVD does not, as another reviewer stated, include the original German and Swiss German soundtrackonly dubbed English or French. This is why it does not rate a full five stars from me.",1507075200,,348,4.629032258064516
2470426,4,B000CR7J3M,"We first saw clips of this movie playing when we visited the Heidi Village in Maienfeld, Switzerland. It seemed so well cast, and authentically set in the Alps, that I had to have it. I've loved the book since I was a child, and this one seemed, as another reviewer put it, as close to the book as I've found. I was excited to be able to order the English version on Amazon.

I'm not a religious person, but I found the omission of Heidi's spiritual growth, and subsequently that of her grandfather's, to be the one big flaw in this film, and one that affects the story significantly. Without this growth, or growth of some kind, none of the characters grow, and growth is an essential part of the narrative arc of any fiction. Heidi is the victim of circumstance, as in the book--she leaves the Alm to go to Frankfort, and her sleepwalking causes her to be sent back again--but this is essentially a series of events, with Heidi capering and being charming throughout. Omitting the book's emphasis on Heidi's compassion for others, especially Peter's grandmother, and her evolving understanding of her place in a spiritual universe, just leaves a picturesque story, rather than the story that has affected generations of readers.

Fine for the whole family, and visually and cinematically gorgeous, but this version will not stay with you the way the book does. It may make you want to visit Switzerland.",1503705600,5,1405,4.7306122448979595

2470428,5,B000CR7J3M,"Yes, it does have German or English options as well as English subtitles.
The best Heidi I've seen; did it cover all Heidi story aspects - probably not, but what it did cover was more than sufficient to keep the viewer engaged. Acting - superb; filming, editing - superb; authenticity and beauty of scenes - superb.
Yes, it's hard to go wrong with this story and you already know how it turns out, but no matter it still felt suspenseful and warm and kindly and adventuresome.",1499731200,,476,4.546511627906977
2470429,4,B000CR7J3M,"Heidi,"" based on Johanna Spyris 1880 novel, has been adapted several times, most notably as a 1937 feature film starring Shirley Temple in the title role. There have also been a number of theatre productions, TV programs (including one by Walt Disney), a Japanese anime series, and a Hanna-Barbera feature. This newest version stars Bruno Ganz and marks the big screen debut of Anuk Steffen as the Swiss mountain girl.

Orphan girl Heidi spends the happiest days of her childhood with her grandfather (Ganz), cut off from the outside world in a simple cabin in the Swiss mountains. Together with her friend Peter, she tends to grandfathers goats and thoroughly enjoys her mountain life. But these happy times come to an end when Heidi is taken to Frankfurt by her Aunt Dete (Anna Schinz) to stay with the wealthy Sesemann family and be a playmate for his wheelchair-bound daughter Klara (Isabelle Ottmann), under the supervision of the strict nanny, Fraulein Rottenmeier (Katharina Schuttler). Although the two girls soon become close friends, young Heidi longs for her mountain home and her beloved grandfather.

This is easily the most beautiful looking Heidi ever. The location photography is breathtaking, and the period production design resembles an illustrated childrens book come to life. Ms. Steffen is a ball of energy when we first meet her and easily charms us as she embarks on an adventure not of her choosing. As Heidis eyes are opened to the wonders of a world shes never known, she is torn between wonderful  and sometimes not so great  new experiences, and her desire to go back to her life in the mountains with the grandfather she adores. Though the Shirley Temple version is excellent, we are clearly watching movie star Temple playing a role. In this version, the unfamiliar Ms. Steffen convinces as a socially awkward waif making her way in new surroundings.

The film is in German, with English subtitles. For kids who aren't fond of reading subtitles, theres also an English dubbed version. There are no bonus features on the unrated widescreen DVD release.",1491436800,,2082,4.988472622478386
2470430,5,B000CR7J3M,"I could NOT WAIT to get this DVD!  Being a huge fan of anything HEIDI I have several film versions in my collection.  I first heard of this movie early this year when it was first released in Europe with the actors speaking German.  Sadly, I don't speak German so I hoped it would come out in an English version.  This is it (along with the same film dubbed in French)!  Its one of the absolute best versions of HEIDI thats been made and really sticks close to the original tale by Johanna Spyri.  There are some subtle changes to the story but nothing I found annoying.  The little actress Anuk Steffen is absolutely perfect as the young heroine and Bruno Ganz is wonderful as Heidis beloved Grandfather.  One thing I loved was the addition of a small back story on Heidis friend Klara, played by Isabelle Ottmann.  The strict governess Fraulein Rottenmeier (Katharine Schuttler) was a delightfully comic character and I really enjoyed the performances of Peter Lohmeyer and Jella Haase as Sebastian the butler and Tinette the French maid! Young Quirin Agrippi rounds out the cast as Heidis best friend Peter.  I will be recommending this lovely film to my friends and family!  Enjoy!",1478822400,16,1185,4.703883495145631
2470431,5,B000CR7J3M,"I saw this movie on a flight and loved it!  It was a bit disconcerting to hear Bruno Ganz as Grandfather (I've only seen him in Downfall), but he and Anuk Steffen were perfect together.  As a matter of fact, the entire cast were wonderful.  The story is told beautifully and, of course, the scenery is gorgeous!  I highly recommend this to all Heidi fans, even Miyazaki fans.",1477180800,3,375,4.470588235294118

8100920,5,B000CR7J3M,"Wanting to get copies for relatives with young children, I was concerned about a complaint among these reviews that this version had been edited.  I compared this 2017 version side-by-side with a 2005 dvd and with a 1994 VHS tape.  As far as I can tell, the digital content of the 2005 and 2017 dvds are completely identical in every respect even though the copyright dates on the packaging are different (something for lawyers to discuss if a question ever comes up, I guess).  Editing is identical for the black-and-white and colorized versions on the dvds and for the (colorized only) VHS version.  All are the same length as reported for the 1937 studio release.  I conclude that there has been no editing, but perhaps someone remembers scenes from other productions of the popular story.

Colorization on the VHS version was significantly different, though -- and not just because of tape deterioration.  I prefer the generally more muted dvd colors.",1517875200,,955,4.93125
