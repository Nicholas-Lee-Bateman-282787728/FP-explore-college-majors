8126711,4,B000FUF71W,I gave this movie four stars because of the message and the majority of the acting skills were excellent. Ashley Walters has talent. I saw one other movie he was in and he did an excellent job. I didn't know he was a rapper but he has great acting skills.,1474416000,,255,4.12
8126712,1,B000FUF71W,I read the reviews and thought I should add to my collection. I did not like this movie at all. Would not recommend,1367539200,,115,4.043478260869565
8126713,5,B000FUF71W,"I was concerned in the begining because it started out so slow.  I actually didn't realize how good it was until the end.  During the movie I was just wondering what the point was, but when you think about it, why do these kids do any of the things they do? That was the point.  I loved the twist at the end. Certainly wasn't expecting it at all.  Great movie.",1292803200,,360,4.1
8126714,4,B000FUF71W,"I liked this movie a lot Ashley Walters is a famous british rapper apparentley who has apperently appeared in Get Rich or Die Tryin with 50 Cent and here he makes like Ice Cube and proves hes an incredible actor aswell. Ashley Walters preformance comes straight from the heart having served jail time for firearms offences which are taken extremely seriously in the uk. The story is almost simplistic enough to ruin the film the message is almost too much to take but the amazing preformances manage to keep it all verry fresh and gripping the one thing that struck me here was the overwhelming sense of dread and doom you know from the moment you see Ashley on screen for the first time your watching his last moments but at the same time theres a sense of hope and optomism that runs along side it. I was aslo struck by a sense of fragility an etheral light feeling and a feel for how delicate life is, something an american movie and even a lesser british movie wouldnt have had, thats not to say this isn't a violent film just a little more feeling to it it than the average ghetto people shooting each other to a rap soundtrack movie.

The message is clear from Ashley Walters preformance to the verry last few seconds of film, people who use guns on the street to look cool and secure their rep more often than not get shot at.

Word of warning though British ghetto accents are not verry well represented in america and you probablly will have difficulty understanding some of whats being said and may need to switch on subtitles.

Overall a good movie with solid acting even if it is all a tad cliched it stil manages to kep you hooked and never gets boring and is overall a more mature movie than the gnre average and you wil probablly want to watch this more than once. Great for genre fans who maybe want to expand their horizons.

8126715,4,B000FUF71W,"This movie is in line of British works (""Kidulthood"", for instance) by producers concerned with reality of contemporary England, into which importing the in-advance- biologically-under-caste of supposedly equal ""new Brits"" is just a part of usual neo-colonial politics discriminating on non-Anglo-Saxon/Celtic basis, while mentoring a rest of the world on British ""human rights achievements"".

Grey, bleak, opportunities-short reality of non-Britain-linked-biologically is being disclosed on example of Afro-migrants, where state-sponsored food and housing just boost a quest for a better life sponsored by drug-trafficking and illegal activities, murdering is among them, as other ways closed down for reasons mentioned above.

And this situation ought to be extended to Australia, Canada and surely New Zealand, British Commonwealth's copycats of the UK, to a great extent.",1205625600,,875,6.105691056910569
8126716,3,B000FUF71W,"Made by BBC Films, this has something of the feel of well made television drama.  The story is simple, and quite familiar, but still manages to raise questions as to how a person's decisions are not radically free - perhaps an obvious point, but one that seems to bear repeating, especially given the context, namely, a released convict from an underprivileged background.  For Ricky, starting afresh means rejecting not just his own past misdeeds, but also his friends - and rejecting his friends (whatever there unfixable faults) is not just difficult, it also comes close to being immoral, so Ricky is truly torn.

The influence of family is also well presented, and some of the gaps speak as loud as the presences, for instance the lack of a biological father in his life. The social realities are shown matter-of-factly and the film stops well short of being preachy.

Curtis, as the twelve year old brother, is a charismatic figure, as is his friend Rio, but some of the other actors struggle to bring their characters to life - at times it's a little bit too obvious that they are 'acting'.  The camerawork, editing, and music all have a suitably 'realistic' English TV aesthetic.

Perhaps not a classic, but worth a look.",1156032000,8,1229,4.800947867298579
