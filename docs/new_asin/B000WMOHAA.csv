8224249,5,B000WMOHAA,"Only a true auto enthusiast will appreciate this DVD.  Watching internal Ford dealer and executive presentations from archives would bore the hell out of most people.  But to someone with gasoline flowing in their veins, the archived films of these meetings show how out of touch this middle aged desk jockies that called themselves auto executives really were.  Further proof that depending on marketing research will NOT SELL CARS. For the most part, people buy cars based on emotion; they want an exciting vehicle.  The EDSEL was the product of men who had no passion whatsoever for cars, and that is why it failed in the marketplace.  That said, the irony is that half a century later the car is an icon.",1231286400,,708,4.770491803278689

  In this DVD, you will find no such scholarly dissertation on why the car failed.  The film starts out with a ""for your eyes only"" film that was sent to the future dealers.  It was watched in private and explained the What and Why of the Edsel. also you see the advertisements showing how they tried to sell the car.  There is even a rather long commercial that I asume was shown in theaters.  Then you get to see the restored cars today at different Edsel shows that are held around the country every year.
  This DVD does not give you critiques on the car or of it's styling, rather it just shows what they did and lets you ponder what happened.  I find that fascinating.
