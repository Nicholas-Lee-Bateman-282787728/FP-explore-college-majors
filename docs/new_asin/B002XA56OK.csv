8383531,5,B002XA56OK,"The poses are easy to perform in double senses that they are truly for beginners and they include a chair part most suitable for office workers. Yoga is definitely made less intimidating and highly accessible through the DVD. The only defect for me is it is boring to practice the same poses every day. Overall, the product is very soothing.",1382659200,,341,4.7
8383532,5,B002XA56OK,"Joanne has created a beautiful and easy to use instructional CD.

Even if you don't have much time, you can go right to what you need on the CD.  The chapters are outlined and will help you take full advantage of even just a few minutes!  If you've wanted to give yoga a try, this is it!  Jill Rapperport, Soaring Eagle Yoga founder,Experienced Registered Yoga Instructor",1269993600,,535,4.648936170212766
8383533,5,B002XA56OK,"I have been attempting to practice Yoga with the Wii Fit program and unfortunately have not had the strength or balance to do many of the poses. This DVD is a perfect place for a beginner like me to start while I work on gaining strength, balance, and flexibility. I also greatly appreciate the fact that the packaging was made from recycled materials. Way to be kind to our earth Joanne!!!",1264809600,3,390,4.507042253521127
8383534,5,B002XA56OK,"I bought this for my mother who has been having some health problems and hasn't been able to walk for a few months.  The chair practice was perfect for her, the instruction is clear and the teacher's voice is warm and gentle.  The rest of the DVD is also great.  A great introduction to yoga for beginners and a nice reminder of the basic poses for people with an established practice.  This truly is yoga for everyone!",1264723200,,419,4.402597402597403
8383535,5,B002XA56OK,"I have been practicing yoga, on and off, for the past 4 years.  The last 7 months, I have been ""off"".  This DVD has inspired me to start again on my journey!  The pace is wonderful to follow along with - and Joanne's calm demeanor is very relaxing.  It is simple enough for a real beginner and yet, a good practice for those with prior knowledge.  I really like her different segments which enable me to adjust the length of my practice.  Thanks for helping me stay healthy and happy!  I would recommend this for everyone!",1263427200,2,522,4.375
8383536,5,B002XA56OK,"Joanne states in one of the interviews that she wanted to create a yoga DVD that her mother could do.  Well, she did - at least she created one that my mother can do!  The DVD covers the true basics and does so without rushing, judging, or relegating the beginner poses to a small inset on the screen.  In the stretching and breathing exercises, Joanne reminds us that we are right where we are supposed to be, right this very minute.  There is no hurry to get into an upside-down pretzel pose.  Yoga finds us and heals us right where we are today.  The DVD gives choices for short sessions (10-30 minutes long) which makes it ideal for people who feel unmotivated to start a DVD because `it's going to take forever.'  Plus, what a great Australian accent!",1263081600,2,756,4.434782608695652
8383537,5,B002XA56OK,"Finally, there is a beginner's introduction to yoga DVD that is true to its title. It is indeed, for Absolute Beginners.  Joanne Spence has created a gentle, engaging series of sequences that the curious (but perhaps timid) new yoga student can undertake without fear of injury.  Joanne's presentation is pleasant, clear, and unhurried.  The new student  can choose from among a variety of session lengths--from about 10 minutes to 30--and so begin to add yoga to his or her day in small manageable increments.  Quite lovely.",1263081600,2,525,5.058139534883721
8383538,5,B002XA56OK,"Absolute beginner yoga is approachable and non-threatening. Real yoga for every body. Joanne offers four yoga segments, divided into doable sections, reminding the beginner, and experienced yoga practitioner, of the importance of linking the breath to movement in maintaining health and vitality. I also enjoyed the interviews with people, from all different levels of experience, sharing how Joanne's teaching and the yoga experience has been instrumental in transforming their lives. This is a great tool for self-care and self-awareness. Get ready to be relaxed, refreshed and rejuvenated!",1262995200,5,592,5.816091954022989
