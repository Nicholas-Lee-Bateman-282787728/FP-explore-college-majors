Really very good with plenty of action for those of you who enjoy the vampirisms and gay sex!!  Have viewed this series three times and get more out of the story line each time I do!  The cost of the collection is well worth the price! n NJMJr!!",1505606400,,411,4.355263157894737
8393390,5,B003B3B1XI,"If you are a die hard fan or collector, do not hesitate to buy this.  Remember, this is not US coded so you will need a region free dvd player, but this is the complete original uncut series from Here TV!  This is a campy cult gay themed vampire series from classic horror director/producer Fred Olin Ray.  Its a thrill a minute as the hero tries to find answers to both what is going on at the Lair club and how to deal with his attraction to the leader of the Lair's Vampires.  Horror, suspense, romance and camp are a recipe for total entertainment.",1452297600,,552,4.278846153846154
