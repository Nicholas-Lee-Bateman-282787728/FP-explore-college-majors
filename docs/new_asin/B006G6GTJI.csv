4985860,5,B006G6GTJI,"I saw this movie at Bad Grannies Bazar in Oklahoma City at a screening. The Director came in person with the producer and one of the actors. They were all quite nice and did a wonderfull Q&A after.  I thought it was really great that they came out all the way from california to talk to us even though it was a small showing.  I mention all this because I met the director and saw that he actually was only 18 years old.

Now to talk about the film. The gore was disgustingly shocking. I haven't seen something like this before. From the first kill to the last kill they are disgustingly shocking. The story was awesome and so was the killers mask. I really related to and cared for the character of adam.  I don't wanna give anything away but I will say this is not just an amazing movie for an 18 year old, but it's an amazing movie all together. WATCH THIS IF YOU CAN!",1327536000,5,871,4.166666666666667
4985861,5,B006G6GTJI,"I found out about this movie after a friend of mine (who is the closest thing I know to a walking horror movie encyclopedia) was raving about it and promised me I'd love it.  I'm glad I took his advice.  My Pure Joy is far from a standard slasher film. You've got the masked killer and graphic violence, but the neat storytelling and the rather deep view into the insane mind of a young serial killer makes me want to tell all about it.

On its surface, the movie is about a high schooler who is a horror film fanatic and starts bringing his horror fantasies to life, murdering the people who surround him.  What gives the movie depth is its good writing and innovative kill scenes that are as creepy as they are grisly.  There's decent character development, teen angst, and some seriously Freudian stuff in here, the kind of things that you don't see very often in your typical slasher. Plus there's the obligatory nudity and a lot of obscure references for horror lovers like me. Bottom line is the genre needs more movies like this.

Not only my Japanese hero Takashi Miike is mentioned in this film but also the extreme French wave with titles such as Inside and Martyrs are spoken of with a lot of respect. It doesn't stop there. I was starstruck when the film mentioned stuff like Dard Divorce and even an older Ittenbach film named ""Premutos."" Then there's a bunch of classic (cult) films lying around on the floor and filmposters throughout the house. The amount of knowledge, fun and respect for these films and the genre in general just warms my heart.

So, I highly recommend this unique movie and hope to see more from the director.",1326585600,33,1645,4.537162162162162

4985874,4,B006G6GTJI,"An interesting journey into the mind of a psychopath! This movie is great. Some intense violence and insane gore (vagina stabbing FTW) makes this indie film something special.  The acting is so/so from most of the cast but the lead actor is so mesmerizing you forgive the rest of the cast.  Great story, awesome twist at the end.",1384560000,,329,4.655172413793103
4985875,5,B006G6GTJI,"I'm not gonna sugar-coat this for ya'll... I LOVE this flick. James Bressack knocked it out of the park with this film. I'm not giving ANY spoilers. Don't listen to the negative reviews, this is a true indie classic! Filled with blood, nudity, and... Well, PURE JOY! Do yourself a solid and scoop this as well as his other flicks (To Jennifer, Hate Crime, 13/13/13, etc) GREAT TIMES ARE WAITING!",1384041600,,395,4.6571428571428575
4985876,5,B006G6GTJI,"On the outside Adam appears to be a normal teenager, but underneath...his mind has been so rotted by trauma from his past and the gory films he watches, that he has blurred the lines between reality and pretend! This prompts Adam to start killing people in similar ways to films he watches, making sure to put his own little spin on it.

MY PURE JOY in one word....demented, insane, twisted, cruel, brutal, and maddening.  Is there one word to describe all of those and then some?

This is the type of B movie I can watch multiple times because I know a lot was poured into the film and anyone's first feature film deserves extra appreciation.  I felt like I was watching a combination of SCREAM and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.  As Adam states in the movie, the murders were ITCHI THE KILLER style.  I was not familiar with ITCHI THE KILLER and had to Google it.  ITCHI THE KILLER is a Japanese film that has been banned in several countries due to its high impact violence and graphic depictions of cruelty.  It must have been a huge inspiration for MY PURE JOY, because it contained some disgustingly awesome scenes and the way it was done was a bit trippy.

The film has a lot of dialogue, but it was funny and easy to listen to.  There are flashbacks to Adam and his father watching slasher films while his father was sick in bed.  Adam's father told Adam that the only way you can get through people is by fear.  Something Adam took seriously.  Interesting enough is that James watched endless movies with his father years ago when his father was sick.  How much inspiration from James father went into MY PURE JOY?

As the movie moves along, the killings occur more often and are equally brutal.  Adam's relationship with his mom cracked me up.  He will go off on her and cuss at her and threaten her, but she's rather casual about it.  Personally I could never swear at my mother, so I think that's what made it funny to me.  Especially after Adam overflows the bathtub and is cleaning up the mess.  His mom sees a knife on him and after he tells her that he'll put the knife in her juggler, she just says he shouldn't talk to her that way and tells him to throw the towels into the dryer when he's done.

Near the end, we meet Adam's brother who disappeared for a decade.  (Somewhat Spoiler Alert) He discovers Adam is the serial killer and has a difficult time convincing the mother.  Eventually the mother is convinced and they confront Adam.  I wasn't sure how it would end.  Watch it!

MY PURE JOY is a film that you'll enjoy...purely....if you have a good sense of humor and enjoy trippy serial killer movies.",1377820800,,2614,4.439075630252101
4985877,1,B006G6GTJI,"let me say to the guys who made this movie good try,i know the director was only like 19 years old or something like that so good for him,hey he made a movie so i give him credit,now the low amount of money is not what really hurt this or the idea of what was happening its the 3 main characters they were so annoying,to much talk about real movies name dropping it got to feel trendy,most of the movies they talk about are great but i hated them sitting around trying to act natural did not work,also the way the whole time you see them hanging out, they smoke blunt after blunt 40oz after 40oz  i mean come on was that the worst weed in the world or something. I think the director has to many of friends in the movie bad acting,bad everything.",1376870400,2,746,4.144827586206897
4985878,1,B006G6GTJI,"If I gave my cats and dogs video cameras, they could make a better film than this.  I have been a DIE HARD horror fan for 32 of my 40 years alive (I thank my father for taking me to see Alien when I was 8 years old against my Mother's wishes!) and if this is the best of ""Indie"" horror than can be made, I have absolutely  NO HOPE for the genre!  Gone are the days of NOTLD, The Crazies, The Last House on the Left . . .A lot of quality slasher pics from the 80's, Pin, even horrifically acted, but extremely original stories like Absentia, Kolobos and Ice From The Sun in the more recent years that have nearly zero budget.  Those of us who LOVE horror . . . who respect it . . .cannot tolerate this type of bowel movement!  ANYONE with a true love of the genre could pay homage to it much more effectively, with less BS.  Strewing some obscure horror movies around in scenes and horror posters on the walls DOES NOT MAKE a good horror movie (anyone that truly LOVES horror movies WOULD NOT have The Driller Killer - probably one of the worst horror movies ever made!!)  Buckets of gore DOES NOT MAKE A GOOD HORROR MOVIE!  There are NO ORIGINAL KILL SCENES in this movie I haven't seen before (Watch Chaos from 2005 for even the most ""shocking"" in this movie!).  I want to vomit when I see ""GOOD"" reviews of trash like this on here and on IMDB that are CLEARLY from persons who either are family or friends of people (need proof - on IMDB, ""A cool urban nightmare that is classic Bressack"" . . .THE KID WAS 18 WHEN HE MADE THIS MOVIE  - HOW IS THIS ""CLASSIC BRESSACK""???????)

In this day and age oft he PG-13 horror movie or the remake massacre of a TRUE horror movie (Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre . . . I can go on and on!), it is time to embrace TRUE, classic horror movies dating back to the silent era (Haxan, Vampyr, Nosferatu) up into the 90's and even in this Century - House of The Devil, Inside, Session 9, The Blair With Project (which YES, was a good horror movie!).  If you want quality gore - try the ORIGINAL Friday the 13th, any Giallo from the 80's, The Sentinel, The Initiation, Curtains, Dead Waters, The Prowler . . . not all of them Oscar-worthy acted, but STILL great horror movies!

The horror genre has truly become a joke because of crap like this - which I have feeling was nothing more that a rich kid who begged Mommy and Daddy to give him $10,000 to make a movie with his friends (Proof - ""he youngest child of two show business veterans - his father, Gordon Bressack, is a three time Emmy Award-winning writer of such shows as Pinky & The Brain and Animaniacs, his mother, Ellen Gerstell, has given voice to dozens of cartoon characters"").

DO NOT waste your money or time with this and truly believe what other 1 star ratings are saying- that the GOOD ratings of this movie HAVE GOT TO BE either family/friends or those who had zero appreciation for the genre!",1375747200,5,2904,4.265938069216758
4985879,2,B006G6GTJI,"This movie was okay for something that should of went straight to a youtube channel or something, but it seemed so low budget that it was only worth, hearing the real classics listed by the character in the movie, just by saying classic slasher films does not make you a classic slasher film.",1358985600,,292,4.528301886792453
4985880,1,B006G6GTJI,"So I watched this piece of work with a few friends this evening, and was thoroughly embarrassed that I asked my friends to watch this movie with me. I wasted 9.95$ and about an hour and a half of my life. Acting was terrible, effects were garbage and majority of the movie I was extremely bored due to the long dragged out stoner conversations the main character and his friends were having. If you are looking for a movie that will disappoint, purchase this film.",1355875200,5,464,4.470588235294118
4985881,5,B006G6GTJI,"""Shocking"" would be an understatement for MY PURE JOY, the feature debut of indie filmmaker James Cullen Bressack. MY PURE JOY is a fun ride if you're a fan of the slasher/serial killer sub-genres of horror, and it truly delivers on its promises of original kills and chilling thrills.

Bressack places the viewer right in the room with the main cast, which consists of three very wonderful characters; they're your average, yet not-so-normal, pot-smoking teenagers with everyday problems and an interesting outlook on life... oh, and they love horror movies! Be on the lookout for some obscure horror movie references, as well. :) Sometimes, however, being a fan of horror films can start a devastating chain of events, as something just isn't right in the neighborhood. Dead bodies are showing up everywhere. Who is doing this? And why?

Death isn't the only problem here, however. Family issues create psychological trauma in ways that would drive anyone nuts! Following the insanity surrounding the story's central character, Adam - played by the very talented Alexei Ryan - begins to rub off on the viewer, as well, as it becomes quite easy to identify with the reasons behind his methods of madness, and, at times, you just may root for Adam.

MY PURE JOY is definitely a recommendable title if, again, you're into this type of film, filled to the brim with blood, guts, some nudity, and shocking violence. An admirable piece of work for the genre and a strong debut from Mr. Bressack.",1355356800,,1491,4.932270916334661
4985882,1,B006G6GTJI,"I am sure all the positive reviews are by people associated with this garbage.  I however am not, and will be very honest; it is a piece of trash!  Amateurish production, filmed with a hand held cam-cord; the special effects are Heinz Ketchup.
I turned it off after 15 minutes and went to Best Buy, since they will give you a $5.00 coupon on returned DVDs.  I only lost about 15 minutes of my life and around $3.00.",1349827200,7,415,4.294871794871795

4985885,4,B006G6GTJI,"This movie is definitely worth watching, although the acting did ruin some parts of the film. The main character was fantastic, but the rest looked like they were reading the lines from a book for the first time. Some of the dialogue was a bit too long, but I like the director's concepts and enjoyed watching it.",1336521600,,313,4.508771929824562

The plot is a good one if made right this could be a very good movie but the acting is extremly bad the effects are even worse! Way to much talking,,,the supposed badass & his girlfriend are more funny than badass! The sceen with the knife & female parts are the worst I've ever seen! U can tell the maker of this film was trying for shocking & failed! I read the reviews & I believe all the 5 stars & great reviews are friends of the guy that made this film!

4985887,3,B006G6GTJI,"My Pure Joy is a new horror film that is completely twisted. In the movie, there are eight gruesome deaths, some of which are hard to watch. When people aren't dying, we are mostly listening to serial killer Adam and his stoner buddies talk a lot about not much all. Those expecting a slasher movie with more action than talk will be disappointed. And I was somewhat disappointed to, because there are a lot of critics who really built My Pure Joy up to be a great film, and it isn't. It's not bad, and it's moments. But it is very rough around the edges, and more along the lines of Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer than a slasher movie in the traditional sense.",1334361600,6,665,4.328
4985888,5,B006G6GTJI,"My Pure Joy, from boy genius James Bressack, is an amazing film!

When I first sat down to watch the film(with a good friend, my lady, and a bottle of good bourbon) I kept a certain open mind, as I usually do when viewing low budget indie movies. You expect a certain degree of bad acting, bad special effects, and ridiculous one-liners.....I was, however, left stunned. The movie I viewed was equally horrifying, funny, and enchanting in a way I could not believe. The raw and pure talent oozing from the film, in the form of James's writing and directing, and the acting of Alexei Ryan, who portrayed the main character Adam, was an amazing surprise.

 The film introduces us to Adam, a SoCal teen, who was raised with a traumatizing upbringing, and an obsession with slasher films. Overwhelmed with his past, and armed with the creative knowledge of death at the end of a sharp knife, Adam goes to work dispacthing friends and neighbors in a very disturbing, and sometimes shockingly original, fashion. There is one method of attack that I was so surprised, and thrilled, by that I WISH I could mention, but I have promised Mr. Bressack that I will not. I will say that a bladed weapon goes somewhere that I have never seen it gone before in my years of watching horror and slasher flicks. The acting by Alexei Ryan is haunting, convincing, and pure genius. I was entranced by the character of Adam, and equally sympathetic and disturbed by him. The acting of the supporting cast ranged from adequate to very excellent. Mr. Bressack stayed true to slasher movie roots, and added a giant share of teen drinking, drug use, sex, and pleasant to view nudity.

James Cullen Bressack has certainly made himself a force to be reckoned with after this debut feature. My group, once the movie was over, could not stop talking about just what the young auteur could produce with a higher budget and more distribution. The sky would certainly be the limit. To view this movie, I would say filmmakers like Eli Roth certainly have a serious force to be reckoned with. His ability to combine terror and comedy, along with teenage angst and behavior, is both refreshing and satisfying. I will also expect to see great things from Alexei Ryan, as his ability to have the audience completely convinced of his honesty is unparalleled in any indie movie I have seen in a long time.

 When the time comes, and I hope it comes soon for all you deranged souls, please view this movie. You will not regret it!!!",1334188800,,2491,4.65
4985889,5,B006G6GTJI,"This is great!  If you're looking for a truly original slasher flick from a truly twisted mind, this is it!  I can't reveal some of the gorier details in this movie, but trust me, you have never seen anything like some of the moments in this film.  This guy is a really talented writer/director, who sets his bizarre slasher antics against the backdrop of an F'd-up family life and a group of loser friends like all of us have known.  I'm grinning, but I'm having trouble sleeping after seeing this.",1334102400,2,499,4.511111111111111
4985890,4,B006G6GTJI,"While a lot of the other reviews mention this is a low-budget film, it does one thing a bunch of low-budget films lack, and that's use every penny to it's potential.

If you're debating on watching this movie, I'd say go in watching it with an open mind. Special fx aren't grade A but with that, they aren't over done either.

A lot of horror flicks are to be psychologically disturbing and if you watch this film as a true horror/gore fan, you'll get what you wanted :).",1334102400,3,471,4.340909090909091
4985891,4,B006G6GTJI,"After reading all the postive reviews on line from critics links on IMDB I decided to check this out. I then came to the amazon page and spent a few days debating. I saw alot of positive reviews and negative reviews. It seems like everyone either loved this one or hated it. I get why now that I have seen it. I want to shed some light on that. I myself am a big fan of horror movies and think indie horror is alot of fun. I'm not sure if the people who negatively reviewed this movie realized it was a low budget film. This is not a hollywood horror film. It was made on a 7k budget, that's right a 7k budget. So you have to anticipate some lower grade special fx and some bad acting.  that is what is fun about low budget films. I mean that's what I loved about all my favorite hollywood made 80's slasher films. This being said, the film is well made for a low budget film. The director shows alot of promise, and the character development of the main character Adam is very interesting to watch and Alexei Ryan is actually quite good as that character. The kills are alot of fun, although some are rough around the edges they are pretty awesome. This film is not scary, but after watching it I don't think it was suppose to be. It felt more like an homage to horror in general. I don't know how someone can call them selves a true fan of horror and hate this movie. There are so many references in this film it's unbelievable. Some of the dialogue scenes where the killer and his buddies are smoking weed are long winded, but that's to be expected of all indie films. Sometimes people don't know how to cut things from their films or just choose not to. I think if you watch this with a level head and realize what you are going to watch, you are going to enjoy yourself. It is alot more well made then most lowbudget indie horror, (stuff in the same budget range.) I mean it's better quality and more fun then alot of the Troma releases in recent history and anything on the Brain Damage label. If you don't know what lowbudget horror is like, give this a try. If you like lowbudget horror, get this one immediately! If you are expecting to watch something that you would see released in theatre's on any given weekend. stay away. Watch this one with an open mind and love for horror and you will have some fun. a 7/10",1334102400,2,2323,4.231981981981982
4985892,1,B006G6GTJI,"The most heinous and cruel part of this film was the sticker price I paid for it.  I frankly could not believe my eyes and I found myself fast forwarding through this elementary piece of bore.  The acting was third tier, the storyline was cardboard, the acting extra mediocre and the gore, well, the silicone nether regions tell you all you need to know.  This was tantamount to some middle school aspiring director, grabbing his camera and having his family participate in this debacle.  Do yourself a favor as the previous rating suggested and pay attention to those that actually have a fondness for this genre and decry this films inadequacies.  A two dollar bin at (the now almost defunct) Blockbuster would be steep in terms of price.",1334016000,10,740,4.75
4985893,1,B006G6GTJI,"So I fell into the trap with all the great reviews and high star ratings of this film. let me say pay attention to the lesser positive reviews for this, rather than the overly posative ones. My one star rating goes only to Alexi Ryan for his role as Adam, he was believable as a person with issues, however the rest of the film was blah and boring,way too much time talking and just doing nothing interesting, even the altercation scene at the party was lame and left me rolling my eyes, the so called ""gore"" effects were cheezy and not believabe, there were some reviews that said the opening scene was so brutal....really?..I've seen better in a PG13 movie.....(WARNING: scene spoiler alert). The close up of a girls vagina being stabbed was so bad, it was just a silicone sex toy that was used....so poorly done.

4985894,5,B006G6GTJI,"James Cullen Bressack has made a very effective first film - at the age of 18 no less!  'My Pure Joy' is fresh, funny, and scary!  Considering the film was made on a very tight budget, the acting is top-notch, the writing is fresh, the directing is creative, and the production values hold their own.  Alexei Ryan as the 'man-child' who gets 'pure joy' from killing is great, and Cory Jacob as his recovering heroin addict brother is excellent.  The death scenes are gory to the max, and bordering on dark comedy --- I look forward to this directors next and future films, and would highly suggest you invest $10 to add this to your horror collection.

4985896,1,B006G6GTJI,"First off I consider myself to be a big fan of horror.  I have watched pretty much all the movies they discuss or name drop in this film.  I enjoy foreign horror just as much if not more than american horror.  I have also watched and enjoyed a number of independent horror films.  So with that out of the way, let me just say this movie was terrible.  Even for a low budget independent movie. Pretty much all aspects of this were all over the place. This includes the acting, the script, the gore effects, the audio and even the camera work. There were actors reciting lines of script like they were reading them from a book.  There were audio problems where two people in the same room would have noticeably different audio levels.  They seemed to use camera effects and transitions too much.  Not sure if they just wanted to see how many ""cool"" things they could fit in the movie.  I could go into more examples, but you get the idea. Now saying all of this, I still believe this director has promise for possible future movies. He shows that he is a fan of Horror and really enjoys it.  I do believe that if more tweaks were made to the script and editing, this would have been much better movie.  So while I cannot recommend this movie to anyone, I have high hopes that this young director will bring better and scarier movie next time.",1332892800,10,1340,4.362903225806452

4985899,5,B006G6GTJI,"Ok so a couple months back one of my friends suggested the facebook fan page for this film. I checked it out and liked the page. a few weeks later they were doing a giveaway of one of the early copies of the film. I ended up winning the copy. It was really easy all I had to do was answer a trivia question. I wasn't expecting much from the film at all really. I knew it was low budget and I figured it would be poorly made, but I watched it anyway because who can say no to a free movie right?

Anyways I pop the film in and was surprised, it looked alot slicker then most lowbudget films. I mean it was still lowbudget but it looked good, like really good. I figured i was going to turn it off after a few minutes but I kept watching it, cus I really got into it. Anyways I AM REALLY GLAD I DID. This was one of the most twisted and sick films I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. It felt like a teen comedy at times but played out mostly like a serial killer drama. I ended up loving this film. At around the half way point my jaw dropped to the floor. I saw a kill in this movie that I cant even type here because I think amazon would probably delete my review for how filthy it is. All I have to say is I think this killscene might go into the horror hall of fame for most disgustingly shocking thing ever, it really is one for the history books. I am hoping the DVD release all of you get to see is UNCUT, because this one kill scene seemed way too messed up for the mainstream stores. Knife+genitalia=fun

After I finished the film, I was awestruck. It made me want to check out more indie horror films. I wasn't expecting much at all but this puppy delivered. I'm hoping I can find more stuff like this on the indie scene. I went online and searched for reviews of this film and it seems like every reviewer loved this one. It really isn't one to miss! Check this bad boy out!",1328486400,6,1887,4.002652519893899

Make sure you have someone with you while watching this, and double check that all the doors are locked. This movie will take everything you thought you knew about someone, and twist it. DO NOT WATCH ALONE.",1328486400,3,338,4.844827586206897
4985901,5,B006G6GTJI,"I was lucky enough to be able to attend a screening of My Pure Joy a few months ago. I'm not a huge gore fanatic---I can take the Romero & Argento films alright, even Peter Jackson's Dead Alive. This film however, is an absolutely trippy experience, in a great way, though. I literally could not take my eyes off it. There ended up being some mayhem in the theatre, but I just kept staring at the screen. The gore is there alright---lots of it, outrageous scenes you could not imagine---but there's also a story, fleshed (no pun intended) out characters, and humor. A really great film if gores your thing---great writing, direction & acting.

I predict you'll hear, and see, a lot more from director James Bressack, in the future. Definitely has a macabre & wild focus and vision. And by the way, this was his 1st feature! Solid entry in the gore genre.",1328140800,16,854,4.545454545454546
4985902,5,B006G6GTJI,"When I got to see this movie at the American Film Market I couldn't believe what I was watching. The quality is amazing for an indie project, and more taking into consideration that the director was 18 at the time. If you like gore, crude horror movies, don't think twice, it'll surprise you...

8497427,3,B006G6GTJI,Well this isn't a bad movie don't get me wrong i love underground horror from german asain and Italian films not mention the scenes in the movie with the 3 friends smoking n drinking and all thr movies they mentioned i seen and enjoy but those parts seem to just drag on and one with how hots ur mom and who's rolling what this time just feels like filler i will admit the first half i enjoyed the murder of the little boy was errie with the killer peeking from the bathrooms with the ring around the roses playing but the second half from the time adam fights with his mom about over running the tub and when the older brother comes for dinner the acting just drags and gos really south it's almost as if the actor's and director just said. fxxk it before i seen this i watched reviews on youtube saying it was the best movie in 20yrs i also herd rumours it was reviews by friends of the director to pump up hype all in all i like it for $8 but the director should of fired the mom and older brother actor's they were what killed last 20 min.of the movie,1433980800,,1055,4.12621359223301
8497428,4,B006G6GTJI,"James Cullen Bressacks My Pure Joy a psychological horror film that shows the steady breakdown of one teenagers sanity. His unguided and frustrated life collapses into a downward spiral of dark psychosis which manifest in fits of homicidal reaction to the world around him. It is a low budget blend between the artistic interpretation of extreme psychosis, and the raw grittiness of torture-porn/slasher mashup which comes off as a very intense mix of grindcore and a coming-of-age thriller.

My Pure Joy is a raw and gritty nightmare that pulls at your psyche the way fears torment the mental. It has an almost home movie feel that plays with the snuff exploitation atmosphere in a very in-your-face bluntness. Dark, edgy and intense. Yet there is a very passionate artistic approach to the tragic tale that shows a sense of compassion for the short coming in a young persons life that could lead them down a sinister path such as the one Bressack exposes in this film. It is graphic and raw so it may not appeal to everyone.",1431734400,,1026,4.796610169491525
