8174440,4,B000JET8NW,"this music brings me much joy. the concert is from 2005. demis' voice is still good. some songs look like they were pre-recorded. if you are a fan,get this. some artists never cross-overed to the usa. his heyday was from 1967to1977 in europe.i wish this dvd was more high-tech.if you want to be uplifted by the joyness of people having a good time, this dvd will be fun. fans of this artist will understand, all others are in for a great discovery. p.s. buy a greatest hits cd and give it to someone who loves romantic music, they will love it.",1194566400,,544,4.396039603960396
