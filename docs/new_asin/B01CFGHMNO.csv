7682783,5,B01CFGHMNO,"In my opinion the waltz is the most melodious of all musical art forms which is why it is my favorite. There is certainly something magical about the waltz since it never fails to please ever since it was first introduced over 200 years ago.
 On this DVD Andre Rieu gives us an assortment of waltz styles by the following composers: Carl Michael Ziehrer (Viennese Citizens); Franz Lehar (Gold and Silver); Nina Rota (The Godfather Waltz); Emmerich Kalman (The Gypsy Princess); Robert Stolz (The White Horse Inn); and, of course, the greatest of them all, Johann Strauss II (Morning Papers; Roses from the South, and the greatest waltz ever written, The Beautiful Blue Danube).
 For good measure he throws in Seventy-six trombones by Meredith Wilson, a traditional clog dance, Carnival of Venice, and a facherpolonaise by Carl Michael Zierher.
 The interior scenes of girls wearing beautiful gowns waltzing in luxurious castles
was matched by the outdoor scenes from Roses from the South where they performed outdoors dancing in the incomparable flower gardens of Mainau Island in the Lake of Constance.
 This DVD is an Andre Rieu treat for the eye and ear.",1465776000,6,1156,5.005208333333333

7682792,2,B01CFGHMNO,"Absolutely terrible video version, I have most of his videos and this one is just bad.  It is alright to listen to but the video is so poor that if you watch then you can easily be distracted by it.  Think of someone filming their tv screen with a camera and you have the quality.  I fell into the trap of watching and looking at each bow which made it a game as they look so bad it is funny.

I don't like making negative reviews on someone whose work I love so much but this was editing was lacking effort, or I and a number of people all got a bad version.",1481932800,2,559,3.920353982300885

7682796,2,B01CFGHMNO,"Bought Magic of the Waltz but it didn't have music that is on the CD.  Also, I own most of Andre Rieu's DVDs and the quality of this DVD is blurry compared to the previous videos.  You'd think it would be better, not worse!",1466294400,2,223,4.045454545454546

8752931,3,B01CFGHMNO,I like this music -- but this collection basically repeats the antics of the orchestra at different locations and becomes tiresome. I would have preferred just the musical numbers be played one after another.,1498694400,,208,5.147058823529412
