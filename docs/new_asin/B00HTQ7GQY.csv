The split screen makes it easy to follow along as it takes you step by step.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes to have fun!!  If you've ever wanted to line dance but didn't want to make a fool of yourself in public, you can learn the line dances at home.  Then you will be the life of the party when you go out!",1394150400,5,475,3.845360824742268

She goes through the steps in parts, and then puts them all together, facing once direction only at first so that you can get it. Then she does all four corners slowly and then to music. By the time she puts it to music you know the dance. I can't wait to go out and try it!",1521417600,,366,3.8933333333333335
