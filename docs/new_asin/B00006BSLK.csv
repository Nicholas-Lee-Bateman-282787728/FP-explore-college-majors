7966840,1,B00006BSLK,"This is the only feature film credited to its director, Scott Farrell, who also serves here as writer and producer, in addition to being a member of the cast.  It is not surprising that this is his only effort, although its rather discordant narrative is not aided by some inexperienced players and a very small budget.  A largely incomprehensible plotline is injected with fantasy elements that lack establishment of any distinct mood or tone, resulting in a melodrama composed of questionable events that are not developed to a viewer's satisfaction.  A young novelist, Rane Kendo (J.C. Whiteshirt) by some unexplained means becomes ensnared within his own published tales that are concerned with Mexican-American street gangs.  His alternative personality that exists inside his written works is one ""Carlos"" (Bradley Gregg), a sensitive poet, while also a gang banger, who does not appear to be terribly similar to Kendo in any respect.  Although the majority of the film's action is of the thick-ear variety, we are exposed to Kendo's self-repugnance as he relates of his having sold out to achieve fame and fortune by way of a shabby television series, ""King of the Streets"", that is based upon his novels.  A news reporter played by Susan Brigham accosts Kendo, accusing him of actually provoking gang activity through his romanticized TV scripts, and after Kendo's sister is slain by what seems to be one of his fictional characters, he decides to in some fashion enter the imaginary world that he has created.  If all of this appears to be rather less than rational, it is, in fact, indeed so.  Unfortunately, the film wants for even one foot that makes much sense at all, since Farrell has not managed to craft a narrative having even the slightest characteristics of anything tenable or artistically engaging.  Gregg gains the acting honours by his game attempt to create his role.  The film was shot in Phoenix, Arizona, and its environs.",1297987200,,1950,5.0092879256965945
7966841,1,B00006BSLK,"This is another film with a deceptive movie cover.  You would think this was a cool New Jack/Nuevo Joaquin film, but it's not.  At its best, it's supposed to be an esoteric, non-linear tale of what happens when authors and artists ""sell out.""  Instead, this is a low-budget stinker to the tenth degree.  This film has a weak plot and a terrible script.  Much illogical stuff happens here.  For example, the main character's editor all of a sudden is a gubernatorial candidate for some unexplained reason.  The editor's office is filled with large Egyptian statues, yet he is not an archaeologist or something else explainable.  This movie has a blondelesbian-fights-blondebisexual scene reminiscent of ""Basic Instinct"" and serving no purpose whatsoever.  Further, every woman in this film is thin and blonde.  I understand that the film takes place in Southern California, but believe me SoCal has lots of women of color, women with dark hair, and women who are heavyset.  What kind of elitism was the director promoting?!  This movie also had few actors of color and that's shocking given that York Entertainment is supposed to be a film company targeted toward ""inner-city youth.""  This is one of the most terrible films I've ever seen in my life!",1038268800,,1249,4.975845410628019
