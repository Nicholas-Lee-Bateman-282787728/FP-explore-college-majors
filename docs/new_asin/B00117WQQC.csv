8240903,5,B00117WQQC,"This vid shows foundational techniques for Club Swinging. It show's how effective lightweight clubs are at developing your shoulders before moving to heavier clubs. Great for beginners. Richard Maguire is very knowledgable on the subject. But this is more for instruction rather than a follow along workout. But you still follow along to get your form down, its just not a warm up, work out, cool down type of DVD. I believe Maguire's other DVD does that.

 Im glad I still had my lightweight clubs for this DVD! Its to hard to work on your form with heavier clubs.",1401667200,,565,4.696969696969697
