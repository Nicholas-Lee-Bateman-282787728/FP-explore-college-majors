2066698,4,B000286RSO,"This is a Maciste picture, actually.  The original title in Italian was ""Maciste alla Corte del Gran Khan"" (Machiste at the Court of the Great Khan).

What makes it interesting is its mediaeval Chinese setting, with Han Chinese versus evil Mongol invaders.  If you're even looking at this review, you've likely seen this done a hundred times before in martial arts films.  Here we have a far more naive presentation of the same setting by Italians.  Instead of martial artistry, you get a muscleman hero who knocks down trees and wrestles tigers.  A pleasant and amusing sensation of cognitive dissonance will be induced by watching this picture, because you've seen it all before, and yet this version is strangely different.  The plot itself is the same one you have seen a hundred times before in Maciste/Samson/Goliath/Hercules pictures, but this time it has been removed from its usual locus in classical antiquity.

Gordon Scott, former Tarzan, provides Maciste/Samson beefcake.  The Chinese setting makes for some weirdly cool soundtrack music, and allows slightly interesting variations on the mandatory hooch dancing scenes.  The mighty Mongol warlord is as usual the cat's-paw for his much more interesting beautiful and evil queen.  The adventure is reasonably well paced, and the special effects slightly less amateurish than usual.  Both sword and sandal fans, and kung fu fans, might get a kick out of this.",1097798400,20,1421,5.184210526315789

2066730,4,B000286RSO,Not bad sword-and-sandal film.  Samson finds himself in China righting wrongs and fighting evildoers.  The Alpha version is strangely enough better than the Retromedia release.  The length is longer and the picture quality is slightly better.  Recommended.,1395532800,2,256,5.837837837837838
2066731,2,B000286RSO,Picture quality very poor.  I didn't get through the whole movie as it was too hard to watch.  The story line was standard italian muscle fare.  The picture was so fuzzy I got a head ache watching it.  Avoid this one,1382400000,,216,4.195121951219512
2066732,2,B000286RSO,This is a very old movie that was very hard to view in streaming. The picture was not sharp; and there was freezing. The acting was  average at best. I stopped the movie after 25 minutes.,1373760000,,187,4.194444444444445
2066733,4,B000286RSO,"It's a shame really. They no longer produce the musclemen movies. Back in the day movie theatres were packed watching Samson,Hercules. Eursus,Atlas,Goliath and the Son of Hurcules. And if there is a better movie than the original Jason and the Argonauts starring Todd Armstrong write me. And you know the best part? You can let your children watch them without fear. Or your grandkids. Nothing objectionable. Just entertainment.",1351987200,2,428,5.3088235294117645
2066734,1,B000286RSO,"The quality of the DVD from Alpha Video is so bad it was barely viewable.  I could shrink it to 1/4 size to view but was still poor quality.  Save your money, buy a frisbee",1221436800,,172,3.8857142857142857

2066736,5,B000286RSO,"When I was young I would watch these types of films. Movies

like this was a way to just let yourself go. Let yourself escape

from your everyday life.

 Then being a kid I would go out to play, stick my chest out and

try to be as strong as I could be. Great fun and memories.

Buy it and feel like a kid again.",1142985600,9,312,3.723076923076923
2066737,5,B000286RSO,"I viewed this film at my local theater when I was just a youngster. At that time I was inthralled by all things ""sword and sandle"". Steve Reeves (Who was a good friend and work out partner of Gordan Scott.) had captured my imagination and inspired me to begin a life long love of body building/weight lifting with his portryal of, Hercules.

""Sampson and the Seven Miracles of the World"" was one of the countless such films that I watched each and every Sat. afternoon. Gordon Scott has always been one of my favorite body builder turned actor. He can actually act !! He also had a build that was on a par with the late great Steeve Reeves and knew how to make the best use of those massiive lats in the scenes where he up roots trees or moves huge boulders. He knew how to make us kids think he was actually lifting something in humanly heavy. As a kid I ate it up.

As an adult, I enjoyed watching this gem because I rememberd all the ""Muscle"" scenes. That was why I watched it after all to begin with. However, with dubed voices, white actors playing Mongols with little or no Mongol make up a (Sampson himself hardly looks like a native.) obviously rubber boulders, a story line that even as a kid I had trouble taking seriously, stunts that were so poor the union would have walked off the set, sets that were obviously left over from another sword and sandle saga set in a completey different culture,,,

It was better in my mind or rather in a child's mind. Still, I give it five stars because as a kid I thought it was great, Gordon Scott was great in it and the ""muscle scenes are still fun to watch as I fast forward through the rest of the film to watch those.

If you can suspend critical observation and slip back into the mind of a child, you ought to buy this movie. If you can't, buy it any way and fast forward away !

8023465,5,B000286RSO,"SAMSON & THE SEVEN MIRACLES OF THE WORLD (1961) stars Gordon Scott as Maciste / Samson, the titular bipedal pile-driver. In this epic, set in China, it's those awful mongols, up to no good again! After a rather bizarre dance routine, where a woman in a tiger-costume is surrounded by ""the huge-head dance troupe"", we witness treachery, as the prince, the rightful heir to the throne, is abducted by ne'er do wells. Enter Samson, knocking over a handy tree, and tossing bad guys like dolls, before teaching a well-sedated and / or stuffed tiger a serious lesson! With the prince safely deposited at a Buddhist temple, Samson plods off to right the wrongs of Asia. Along the way, he finds ample opportunity to stand around shirtless, in his red mini-skirt. Thankfully, his body-oil leads him to the princess Lei-Ling (Yoko Tani), so he can rescue her too. Needless to say, this involves Samson's swinging large objects and throwing grown men around like packing-pellets. Uh-oh! The princess is captured by the odious mongol leader, Garak (Leonardo Severini, who looks like Benny Hill w/ a beard), who seeks to marry her! Can samson save Lei-Ling, before Garak assumes all power? Arriving on the scene, shining as though he were slathered in bear-grease, Big S grabs Lei-Ling and skedaddles. Everything seems rose-y, until Garak finds out where the princess is hiding. Can Samson and his men defeat the mongol hordes? Of course, there's very little hope, unless Samson can move some massive boulders. When the prince is mortally wounded, Samson is sent on a quest by a hermitic wise-man, to ring the ""great bell of freedom"". An uprising begins, but can it possibly succeed? Samson has been killed, and sealed in a tomb! It will take a miracle to save China now! One miracle, coming up! Soon, mongols are flying around like dandelion seeds! An epic ending of biblical proportions explodes! This. Is. Why. God. Invented. Movies!...",1501718400,,1926,4.947530864197531
8023466,1,B000286RSO,Terrible quality. All of the Synergy transfers are unwatchable. A company the size of Amazon should either arrange to acquire quality widescreen prints or just take this junk down.,1497916800,,180,5.241379310344827

8023474,5,B000286RSO,"The Peplum age of movies was a distinct subset. They were a celebration of the world's release from World War II and the foundation of the baby boomers fascination with the 80's fitness craze. Whether it was Steve Reeves, Gordon Scott or Reg Park, there is no way you can be critical of these. They are what they are. You either find them fun or not. Yoko Tani is the comely maiden, very cool. A great trip down memory lane.",1461024000,2,424,4.3125
