8321359,3,B001MJ4UZY,The movie wasent what i had expected. I have viewed other of Yann Arthus-Bertrands films and enjoyed them very much. I will look for more from him.,1370649600,,147,4.481481481481482
8321360,5,B001MJ4UZY,"This video is not like other documentaries - it's a unique experience.  It contains lots of beautiful footage.  It is not only educational, but a pleasure to watch.",1351555200,,164,4.821428571428571
8321361,2,B001MJ4UZY,"To begin with, I'm a huge fan of photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand. I've seen his work in Chicago, and his messages (imagery & captions) are extraordinary. I have many of his books.

This DVD is simply a screen saver. Not a documentary unlike I originally thought. I would highly recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Home-Blu-ray/dp/B0026OE2O8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Home [Blu-ray</a>] by the same director / photographer.

Also, part of the low rating is that I watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Home-Blu-ray/dp/B0026OE2O8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Home [Blu-ray</a>] in blu-ray. Looking at the images of ""Earth From The Air"" in standard definition doesn't do the pictures justice. If this DVD is published in blu-ray, I would consider it.",1248048000,4,842,7.165048543689321
8321362,4,B001MJ4UZY,"This is an amazing video that really makes you think about the human impact on our planet as well as the beauty of nature.

I have a Listmania list on my profile (which may be listed below) on other quality documentary films on the environment.",1244505600,4,431,6.543859649122807
