Gerard Depardieu has an uncredited role as the mayor of a town where the people are killing all strangers in fear of the plague.  Juliette Binoche plays a noblewoman trying to reach her husband's estate when she is rescued by the Italian, when the townspeople go hunting for her.

844949,4,6304343418,"I really enjoyed this film for many years.  And was reminded of this film when watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Plague-History-Channel/dp/B000CSTK7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Plague (History Channel)</a>&nbsp;yesterday although this takes place three hundred years later and is about cholera not bubonic plague - the widespread devastation is the same.

Angelo is running from pursuing ruthless Austrians who are hunting him for having the temerity to resent the Austrian invasion of Italy.  It would be 48 years later, that the German Savoys would succeed in actually overthrowing the Pope and take the Papacy beginning the long period when the Roman loyalists became known as the Black Nobility.  It sucks to be the Roman Empire with a neighbor who for generations constantly eats around the edges, infiltrates to overthrow and inspires the word for destroying public property i.e. ""vandalism"" because they can't stand the beauty of Roman architecture and development.

We never viewed this film as a romance but as an exemplary young man taking care of an older respected woman.

n.b. echoing anti-semitic events that occurred during The Black Death, Angelo is accused of poisoning well water and bringing The Blue Death to the locals as an outsider - In FRANCE - not Germany or Switzerland.

p.s.  The Count of Savoy was responsible for authorizing the anti-semitism that forced a Jewish merchant to ""confess"" that he was the cause of The Black Death by poisoning well water:

[...]

500 years after this, The Horseman on the Roof takes place, then another 100 years later, the Germans invade Poland and start killing Jews and it is all connected to The House of Savoy.  Frightening.

After WW2, the Italian constitution made it illegal for male descendants of the House of Savoy aka King of Italy to enter Italy.",1374364800,,1877,5.43448275862069
844950,4,6304343418,"Juliette Binoche and Olivier Martinez do not fail to charm us in this movie set in dangerous times of plague and war in Southern France.  Olivier is the son of a noble family and Juliette is the wife of a wealthy nobleman when their paths cross throwing them together in a race for survival against the inexorable creep of the black plague as it ravages the country.  Like Tristan and Isolde, these two lovers are torn asunder and reunited as circumstances plot to keep them apart.  Olivier does a nice job playing the loyal and noble young aristocrat dedicated to protecting the vulnerable and proud damsel in distress played by Juliette Binoche.  It is Juliette however who steals our hearts with her vulnerability, pride, strength and simmering passion for her young knight.

845008,4,6304343418,"I really liked this movie. The horseman on the roof, follows the story of a brave and honorable horseman (Angelo), who is trying to get to Italy, and is instead stuck in France where cholera is ravaging the people. Then he meets a countess who is looking for her husband, and he swears to protect her and get her to safety. I really enjoyed the chemistry between the two leads, and I really liked Angelo, he is so honorable and protective. But I just found the ending to be a bit disappointing, and the movie was a little too detailed in its depictions of the cholera.

Its one of the few ""romances"" which I actually enjoyed the parts before the h/H met more then once they had. The pursuit of  Angelo was the most exciting part of the movie, unfortunatly the people chasing him are dead before the first half of the movie is over, and we,re left watching Angelo escort a woman across France who loves another man. Ultimatly this was the source of all the problems I had with the movie. I was never able to get beyond the fact that the heroine was in love with one man while she was supposedly falling in love with Angelo? I never really saw where she stopped loving her husband and started loving him. This just doesn't work as a romance.",1272326400,,796,4.306666666666667

Well, things change. I don't think the main female character could leave the main male character for more than five minutes without becoming completely lost/in danger/helpless. It was quite funny, yet pathetic. To add insult to injury I think they were going for a ""strong"" and ""independent"" young woman-type in her character. So if this is how they construct a ""strong"" and ""independent"" woman...well I'm sure you get my drift.",1256860800,,604,4.761904761904762
845087,5,6304343418,"The words, ""I am breathing heavy, not because of the extreme danger we face, but because of you, my Love,"" seems to define this couche chevaleresque and demand audience involvement with immediate, audacieux consequences. Rugged passion con fuoco, as presented in this historical romance (setting: Aix-de-Provence, France, in 1832), is upon us (from Prologue to Epilogue) in Jean-Paul Rappeneou's epic film Le Hussard sur le Toit (The Horseman on the Roof). Within seconds, the screen is filled brilliant horsemanship, sudden danger from assassins, and two charismatic actors (in flight for their lives).

Unable to resist direct empathy, we can easily leap out of bed, unto a powerful stallion, evade attack at night by swordsmen, before Act I slips her silken covering upon our shoulders. We are never slow to react and defend our heroine (Madame de Theus, played with uncanny resolve by Juliette Binoche; her beauty alone elevates the film). Again, dramatic empathy of a high order prevails because the director's intent is achieved, to maintain sustained tension and danger without any diminuendo (needed); to ascend with the powerful crescendo to the denouement, into the major climax; which can be a true bodyguard experience for a woman viewer when her man does not experience fatigue (no matter what). In order to accomplish this tour de force, the motion picture must be filled to the brim with the unsavory liquor of adventure; in fact, it is consumed with a man's extreme loyalty to his Lady. Chivalry placed at her feet.

Even the reaction of our hero (Angelo Pardi, played with passion by Olivier Martinez) to the point of a sword is sensuously precarious, because he risks everything. Death may corner him, but a knight's chivalry is so within his grasp, he can outride, outfight secret police; leap past assassins (reminiscent of Errol Flynn in his best roles); and as her knight-guardian protect her throughout the day and night. We end the film with unspoken passion. Dramatic intensity remained high-pitched, uncompromising, unto the final words of our heroine. We are, I believe, less inhibited for a time after viewing this film. Our just reward: We are willing to ride a stallion in our dreams, now so affected by this film, its unrelenting action, and its stirring soundtrack.",1245110400,4,2297,5.1226666666666665
845088,4,6304343418,"This was a very good romantic period piece.  The chemistry between Binoche and Martinez leaped from the screen. I found myself rooting for them to kiss, which they  never did, even though she was married and he an honorable gentleman. But if romance is the major theme of the movie, it hurts the movie when their is no psychical contact between the two lovers. The narration at the end told us what might happen in the future, from Binoche's character's husband's perspective, but temptation on her part should have been expressed with more than just a look. The antagonist of the movie was the disease that ravaged Italy and France. The story kept me interested, which is no small accomplishment, considering I never buy or keep movies that I have to read the dialogue. I will keep this one. Adventure was a secondary character as we were taken to many locals through chases, hiding and despertion.

To surmise. I  like this movie. Martinez was good as the romantic lead, with his stubborn resolve and sense of duty. Binoche was great as the determined wife who has resolved not to give in to her feelings for Martinez , while she searches for her missing husband. Not a  new story , but the right actors and good writing can always make this story seem fresh. These are the right actors in a good movie.",1244851200,2,1305,4.607758620689655
845089,4,6304343418,"The time is 1832, certain Italians are fomenting a revolution against the Austrian Empire for control of the northern part of their country.  Some of the revolutionaries have gone into exile in France, where they are pursued by Austrian agents.  What starts out as a an an action filled escape from the Austrian agents quickly becomes an effort to escape the cholera pandemic sweeping France.  Further complicating matters are angry mobs ready to chase down and lynch strangers whom they suspect of poisoning their water, and avoiding French soldiers who have orders to round up everyone and put them in quarantine.  (Quarantine being something you want to avoid at all costs.  To be thrown in with the sick and dying is a nearly guaranteed death sentence.)

This is a gorgeous movie with spectacular cinematography of the French countryside, including a breathtaking fairy tale castle near the Alps.

The equally gorgeous cast includes  Olivier Martinez as Angelo Pardi, a young Italian colonel, and Juliette Binoche as Pauline de Thus, a French noblewoman.  Pardi is a gallant gentleman who would not dream of pressing his affections on the lady whom he is escorting and protecting.  The distance he maintains only serves to heighten the romantic aspect of the film.  (This is for people who find ""Jane Eyre"" a far more exciting love story than something like ""Pretty Woman"".)  There is also plenty of action and several exciting chase sequences to keep things lively.

The DVD special features include scene selection, sneak peeks, English subtitles and captioning for the hearing impaired.

845146,3,6304343418,"Jean-Paul Rappeneau's grand romantic adventure starts off with Italian exile Olivier Martinez on the run from Austrian assassins until an outbreak of cholera outruns them both, turning the beautiful countryside into a treacherous series of army roadblocks, deadly quarantine areas and a feeding ground for flocks of crows. It's an episodic affair - leading lady Juliette Binoche isn't even introduced until a third into the film - but its shot through with such lavish old-fashioned romanticism that that's not really a problem. Indeed, not even the lack of a proper ending can do much damage.

As with Cyrano De Bergerac, Rappeneau shows a real understanding of movement and color, with a wonderful use of both the landscape of a semi-mythical Provence and the full width of the Scope screen. En route there are a slew of nice little cameos (Gerard Depardieu, Jean Yanne, Isabelle Carre) and memorable moments, adding up to a satisfyingly old fashioned epic that stands up well to repeated viewings.

BUT, and it's a big one, in their infinite wisdom Miramax decided to cut the film by 16 minutes for the US market - including all of Isabelle Carre's very appealing Cesar-nominated supporting role - and this is the version on the Region 1 DVD. However, if you have a multi-region player, the UK DVD isuncut, subtitled and in 2.35:1 widescreen and also comes with a particularly good 28-minute interview with Rappeneau.",1197763200,5,1420,5.038297872340426

845150,1,6304343418,"In 1829 the second pandemic of Asiatic Cholera began spreading through Europe. As our story opens in July 1833,not only is the epidemic spreading,but Austria has invaded Italy and Italian patriots have flown to France. This is the backdrop of the story of fleeing Italian Colonel Angelo (Olivier Martinez) and his chance meeting with the Marquess de Theus (Juliette Binoche).This meeting, though,does not occur until the second hour of this Jean-Paul Rappeneau directed period piece. We watch Angelo fight his way through cholera,hysterical townspeople,French police,Austrian soldiers and Italian stoolpidgeons, and each time he escapes miraculously unscathed looking better each time,no worse for the wear. By the time Angelo meets the Marquss,who is held up in her Aunt's manorhouse, the viewer has already been challenged to just keep up with Angelo,whom nothing sticks to him, havingmore narrow escapes than Indiana Jones in all three RAIDERS flicks. I have wanted to like this film over the years,but it is so mind-numbingly ridiculous that one has got to call a spade a spade and just say,""This film stinks like the plague!"".

Apart from some of the finest cinematography that a film could offer, watching eye candy actors Binoche and Martinez in an extremely dull script that has possibly the most truncated ending ever remembered by this reviewer,is simply not enough to save this film from being consumed by the crows that peck at the dead bodies of cholera victims. In fact, the crows and the cat are far more interesting than Binoche and Martinez! How many times did Rappeneau direct Martinez to toss his brunette locks???

This film is truly one of the most inane pieces of dribble that I have ever seen. The continuity errors alone are staggering as Martinez and Binoche are continually made even more pretty despite all that they endure. In one seen early on,Martinez is kicked and beaten and bloodied by townspeople,only to be dragged away blood-free! The next scene he is totally cleaned up (though no one has helped him) with only a forehead scar that is gone within hours-no swelling or bruising. You can almost hear,""CUT!!...MAKE-UP!!"" Naturally,Binoche gets cholera near the fim's conclusion, and Martinez strips her naked and rubs her down. She survives,though every man Martinez tries to save dies. He never has to strip the men further than the waist!!! Rappeneau seemed more intent on keeping his principle stars beautiful,sensual and pouty-lipped,then tell a story of any real substance. Only the most hopeless romantic would dare not see through this farce! Martinez and Binoche NEVER become their characters and the viewer is always aware that two gorgeous actors are attempting to play their roles.

The ending is unforgiveable and completely unsatisfying and unsubstantiated after 120 minutes of enduring Rappeneau's rant. Did the editor lose part of the film and Rappeneau just say LET'S GO WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT in French? MON DIEU!!!

A dashing young Italian colonel, driven by patriotism (like my Italian grandfather, who emigrated from Trieste to England so as not to have to join the Austrian army - though the movie's time is before that great phrase ""Italia irredenta""). A lovely young French noblewoman, caught up in the chaos of a cholera epidemic and who does not know if her aged husband is alive or dead. Chivalry, adventures, escapes at full gallop, pistol-shots, fights, betrayals, devotion. And above all, the heart-achingly beautiful landscapes of southern France, often with the snowy Savoy Alps in the background.

The colonel in his sacred, if somewhat rigid, honor, so bravely resisting all temptations, and the beautiful lady forgiving him for doing so...Finally, that versatile reviewer ""Anonymous"" has a great saying: ""The ending is like a drop of honey on the tip of the tongue.""

All the wonderful scenes of the early 19c towns and people and life...the splendid horses...and the cat! I want to know what happened to the cat!

845203,5,6304343418,"I'm sure it wasn't easy for Jean Paul Rappeneau to undertake a new film project after the onscreen poem that became his 1990 ""Cyrano de Bergerac"", a movie I personally consider a timeless masterpiece of unsurpassable proportions, even for its own creator. Yet in 1995 with the screen adaptation of Jean Giono's novel ""Le Hussard sur le Toit"", Rappeneau simply couldn't have chosen better. Rappeneau ended up not only delivering but fully complying to legions of fans. ""Hussard"" is a tremendous movie. Suffocating, for the thick scenes of widespread death depicting a tremendous cholera epidemic sweeping Europe at the time of the events (circa 1830). Magical, for setting up a captivating story within the impressive historical background of multiple political and social turmoils erupting all accross a convulsed continent in times of change. Mesmerizing, for how a moving and almost impossible love story unfolds within such tragic scenarios,  just as the most delicate embroidery can only be viewed when you hold the genre against the light. Juliette Binoche's magnificent rendition of Pauline de Thus was expected, as the truly great actress she is. However, Olivier Martinez came as a pleasant surprise in his portray of Angelo Pardi, the utterly handsome Italian revolutionary endlessly escaping fate and destiny. The breathtaking scenery of the French countryside is the third leading character of this movie... and a curious fact not widely reported: the uncredited and brief appearance of, the one and only, Grard Depardieu as the unexpected Commissaire de Police at Manosque!.

(Already there are many, many insightful reviews, but the following is my take.)

These are the basics on the acting levels and production values for this film:

-In our main character, Olivier gives us someone who is young and brash and beautiful.....and that's all he had to do; he gives us someone who is swashbuckling.....and that's all he had to do; he gives us someone who, above all else, is protective of the one he single-mindedly loves.....and that's all he had to do.

-In the character of our Lady in Distress, Juliette gives us someone who is lovely, who is true and who, in all things, keeps heart.....and that's all she had to do.

-In Directing and Cinematography, Rappeneau and Arbogast have given us a picture which is sweeping and stunningly beautiful.....and that's all they had to do.

I was afraid that I would find them distracting, but the movie was so well done that it didn't register really that I had to ""read"" the movie.  The cinematography was superbly accomplished and the story line was engaging.  The only reason why I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that I would have liked to know more about the 2 characters at the end of the story.

Set in a beautiful summer in the mid-19th century, it follows Olivier Martinez's Italian in exile as he is chased across France by Austrian agents intent on killing as many Italian rebels as they can only for his pursuers to be outrun by a cholera epidemic that picks off friends and foes. Along the way his path crosses with various victims and survivors - a doctor who teaches him a neat disinfecting trick of setting your hands on fire, a cute governess, Jean Yanne's duplicitous peddler, Gerard Depardieu's paranoid mayor, and most importantly Juliette Binoche, who is determined to find her husband. Naturally they become travelling companions as they try to get through roadblocks and avoid being put into quarantine by the soldiers cordoning off the roads - a virtual death sentence - and eventually nearly become more. The film looks so good in cinemascope and so much of it is terrific than you can just about forgive the fact that the ending is a bit of a washout after everything that's gone before.

A really enjoyable old-fashioned epic, I'd definitely pick this up if it ever turned up on DVD uncut with English subtitles (the Miramax disc is typically cut by 17 minutes thanks to Harvey Scissorhands).",1120262400,21,1454,4.765873015873016

The scenery, the light, what a beautiful country the south of France is. It is a love story that takes place in the mind. No bed scene. But I swear, you won't be bored for a second! If you haven't read the novel (which you should do) you might think this to be some kind of Musketeer-Disney stuff. It isn't - not only because it takes place in another century. There is enough adventure, fighting and horseback riding to make this one a movie for both of you to enjoy, you and your girl. But it also gets so much deeper. The actors show you love can stand the test of time. It can even grow through pain. This one gives you strength and hope that things might get better.",1105228800,60,729,4.207142857142857

The acting is superb. I've always loved Juliette Binoche (Chocolat, The English Patient American movies) and I met Oliver Martnez through this movie. Both portray their roles amazingly and delicately, adding something great to a slightly dull script.
The scenery is absolutely stunning, enough said. This is well worth seeing, if you don't mind subtitles. (I don't at all ^^)",1077580800,,540,5.011111111111111
845210,4,6304343418,"Olivier Martinez has been called the French Brad Pitt. How about Juliette Binoche as the French Julia Roberts.  Or is that not saying enough in either case?
Well, whatever your opinions of the actors in general, they are perfectly cast in this corker of a romantic adventure. Perfect chemistry between the two stars adds to what already a good, old fashioned high spirited adventure film.  They don't make 'em like this anymore--either in this country or in France.
In fact, when you think of current French cinema, you tend to come up with charming, but self-consciously post-modern works like AMELIE or L'AUBERGE ESPAGNOLE.  That kind of nod-and-a-wink filmmaking has its place, and I have nothing but affection for those films, but there's something about good old school stroytelling that can be utterly enthralling.  You're actually allowed to get caught up in the tale and to forget that you're in a cinema (or your living room) watching images on film (or videotape or DVD or whatever).  What a concept!
I am unfamiliar with most of director Rappeneau's work--although I have heard good things about his version of CYRANO and the celebrated ZAZIE DANS LE METRO.  He certainly has a flair for historical romance, so I am now eager to see his treatment of the Edmond de Rostand classic.  Or almost anything else he's done for that matter.  He appears to have a great visual sense (or knows enough to seek out cinematographers who do).  It's hard to think of a more beautifully shot film.
Like most films, HORSEMAN ON THE ROOF is not for everyone.  But for lovers of foreign films in general--and of real romantic adventure in particular--this film delivers the goods.",1074902400,11,1672,4.897163120567376

Rather then get into the specifics of the plot which can be seen in the myriad of other reviews, I want to stress how this movie was only made possible due to the supreme casting by Director Jean-Paul Rappeneau and Producer Rene Cleitman.  The choice of Mr. Martinez brought this movie to life.  Befroe his death in 1970 Giono said that in the belief of Neo-Realism that the actor be a commoner.  While not at that level, Martinez portrays an air that other well known actors are unable to feign.
In addition, Julliette Binoche is able to work with him to the point where we are able to actually see Martinez grow throughout the film.  All in all a fantastic watch and the upcoming release on DVD will hopefully bring a few more fans of Rappeneau into the mix.",1051920000,45,972,4.5
845275,5,6304343418,"""The Horseman on the Roof"" opens in Aix-en-Provence in July, 1832, as Austrian secret police hunt down two Italian revolutionaries operating from exile in France.  At that time, a huge chunk of northern Italy was under the control of the Austrian Empire, and Metternich's spies regularly scoured Europe sniffing out and assassinating opponents of Austrian rule there.  This movie revolves around Angelo Pardi (played by Olivier Martinez), one of the two revolutionaries.
Fleeing from the Austrian agents in Aix, Angelo goes out into rural Provence, where he quickly finds an even worse enemy: a massive cholera epidemic, ""the worst in a century"", says one village doctor.  As the epidemic spreads, mass hysteria follows in its wake.  Rural Provencals start to hunt down perceived ""empoisonneurs"" (poisoners), innocent people accused of contaminating the water (a scene common in French history).  Angelo himself is attacked as he drinks water from a fountain while coming into one town.  Here Gerard Depardieu makes a nominal appearance as the town's police chief on the run, who says rightly, ""The cholera's a bitch, but this is worse.""  Angelo ends up hiding from the mob in the house of the beautiful Madame de Theus (played by Juliette Binoche).
The main story takes off when the army comes in and moves the entire town out into the countryside to sit in quarantine.  There, Angelo runs into some of his exiled Italian friends, who have a dangerous mission for him: break through the quarantine lines (he could be shot for doing it), brave the epidemic, and ride to Milan with two bags of money to help finance a rebellion against the Austrians.
This task would be dangerous enough, but Angelo's chivalry snags him into taking Madame de Theus alongside him on a wild ride in search of her husband, who vanished when the cholera broke out.  Does she find him?  Does Angelo make it to Italy?  Do the Austrian spies come back into play?  I'll leave that for you to find out.
Jean-Paul Rappeneau did an outstanding job with this film.  The cinematography is superb and includes some stunning shots of the gorgeous landscape of Provence, ranging from the luscious Rhone valley to the majestic Hautes-Alpes.  (Yet it also leaves a melancholy aftertaste behind and proves that Provence can be just as miserable a place as anywhere else in Europe.)  The acting is convincing, and so is the plot.

845276,5,6304343418,"I wrote a review of this film in August of 2000 several years
after seeing it on the big screen. Recently, I rented the
video and over the course of a month, watched it six more
times. Each time I viewed Horseman, I discovered more and
more, the minute details that I just didn't see the first
time through.
Many reviewers have critisized the film for the horror, not
enough action, not enough dialouge, or that Angelo(Olivier
Martinez) was two dimensional. The first thing that I noticed
about Martinez was his gorgeous looks, but as I came to know
the character better, and watched how others interacted with
him, I became more and more engaged with the fun of this
character. I have also read the books that deal with Angelo,
and believe that Martinez captures this character perfectly.
Angelo is a young noble who has been raised to be honorable
and fearless by his Italian duchess mother. His honor is,
above all, the most driving force of his life. His mother
has also taught him, from childhood, to defend Italy from
all invaders. These two components, when confronted by
events and people (particularly Pauline), create some very
amusing scenes in the film. But a one time viewing doesn't
allow the spectator to catch all of the subtle undercurrents
of this beautiful film.
Some viewers are put off by all the dead bodies, but it
is an important part of French history, that really existed.
To be sure, the film is very mild compared to what the
French actually faced during those dreadful times.
Finally, some viewers have been annoyed by the lack of love
scenes between the two main characters. The viewer needs
to remember that the events are depicted in 1825, and
people weren't as quick to express sexual and/or romantic
feelings as is done today.
The ending is appropriate because Angelo is in Italy
fighting for its freedom. Any contact between distances
takes months and sometimes years, considering the circumstances,
to actualize. But you do know that Pauline and Angelo yearn
to be together, and that is simply a part of life during
that era.

past.",1006905600,12,2130,4.743935309973046

Olivier Martinez is Angelo, a young Italian Captain/horserider of the army (sorry don't know the grade in American English, he is a 'hussard'). He has to escape to France because he is chased by Austrian assassins and conspirators. Once there,in the South of France, he discovers that there is a serious epidemic of cholera. He has to deal with crazy local people but he also tries to help them. One day, he takes refuge in the house of Pauline De Theus (beautiful Juliette Binoche)...

This is the beginning of their story which is very moving and very intense..... You can feel their attraction and their feelings in the looks between the actors, in their interactions and some of their arguments.
