Sabu VS Abyss: A good match. Love Sabu matches, even though some aren't that great. Abyss is well, just anther hardcore wrestler to me.

Matt Bentley & Austin Aries VS Alex Shelley & Roderick Strong: Something TNA is lacking these days. The X-Division was so rich in talent and it is all but gone. I think it disappeared after they said wrestlers couldn't go back and fourth to Ring of Honor. Actully, someone check that story out. It does seem like the downfall of the X-division after that.

Raven VS Chris K: I love how TNA signs stars and then proceeds to misuse there talents. Raven like many other TNA stars like Rhino, Chris Harris, AJ Styles are some examples. They give them titles for a brief time and after that, throw them away. Sad really but it doesnt seem to register to TNA fans.

Team Canada VS 3Live Kru: I hate both teams.

Basebrawl: Sonjay Dutt, Chris Sabin, Dale Torborg w/White Sox member AJ Pierzynski VS Diamonds In The Rough: Bobby Heenan does commentary on this match. I have no idea why. It was an alright match but it won't stand out as a classic.

Christian Cage VS Monty Brown: Cage's first TNA ppv match. It was for the #1 contendership. Cage wins of course. I think once of this incentives in his contract was to win the world title.

AMW VS Team 3-D: A pretty good match.

AJ Styles VS Samoa Joe: Before these men were lost in the TNA shuffle, they were awesome wrestlers. This is one of the best matches of 2005. Its what made fans watch TNA. Just an awesome, awesome match.

Triple H- whoops I meant Jeff Jarrett VS Rhino: Who really cares? I dont.

Overall, a good PPV. A few matches I couldn't care for. The TNA main events are usually always bad and have too much outside interference. Highly recommended PPV.",1200355200,,1768,4.462732919254658

1. Sabu vs. Abyss in s Barbed Wire Massacre Match- I will have to say this was not the best one on one wrestling match but you have got to give it up for these two guys for putting there bodies on the line. This was a hard match to watch to imagin the pain that these two went through was amazing. There were some average spots to start the match with there bodies going into the barbwire and there was a sweet spot were Sabu hit a suicide dive over the top rope barbwire. They brought in some barbwire boards and Sabu drove Abyss into them and than sandwiched him into them and hit a Arabian face buster for the win sick stuff here. Winner Sabu. Match Rating 8/10.

2. Matt Bentley and Austin Aries vs. Alex Shelly and Roderick Strong- This was a awesome match to fallow the last one up. A total opposite and it turned out to be great. This was just a high flying match and a fast pace match the way the X-Division was supposed to be. Not a whole lot to say about this match other than it had a lot of near falls and just a bunch of fun to watch. Winners Matt Bentley and Austin Aries. Match Rating 8/10.

3. Raven vs. Chris K- This was just a filler match. I liked the whole idea of how the were making a big war between raven and Larry because Raven never got a rematch for the title that he was screwed out of. That is all good but the match was just not to good because of how old both these guys are. I will say they tried hard and it was not to bad. Almost a brawl sort of and there was a nice moment were Raven hit a power bomb on the chair. Winner Raven. Match Rating 5/10.

4. The 4Live Crew vs. Team Canada- This match was an okay match this seemed like another filler. This also had a good storyline to it because of the 4Live crew history. This was just a solid wrestling match not to long which was good kept short. The nice part of the match was when Konan hit Kip James in the head with a chair and turned on the team great stuff and a big surprise. Winners Team Canada. Match Rating 6/10.\

5. The Diamonds in the rough vs. Sonjay Dutt, Chris Sabin, and Dale Torborg in a Baseball Brawl match- This was a match that I really enjoyed watching. Again this was almost a sort of X-Division type of match. A lot of people say that they don't like the baseball stars in TNA but I think they help them. Just a lot of fast pace high flying moves and some nice spots for A.J. Persiznski. Good stuff. Winners Sonjay Dutt, Chris Sabin, and Dale Torborg. Match Rating 7.5/10.

6. Monty Brown vs. Christian Cage a contenders match- This match had a great storyline and a lot of hype behind it was good but it could have been better. This was just a solid wrestling match with almost all of it controlled by brown. The one thing that I really did not like was brown controlled a lot of the match and than with basically with one move cage won the match. Still very solid and a fun start. Match Rating 7.5/10.

7. Americas Most Wanted vs. Team 3D in a tables match- This was just another solid match but It was more fun cause of the table aspect. There was some solid action including a lot of nice table spots and there were a few sick chair shots. There were a lot of spots were you thought that the team was going to put the other person through the table and they moved the table out of the way. Just a fun match to watch and some nice table spots as well. Winners Team 3D. Match Rating 7.5/10.

8. A.J. Styles vs. Samoa Joe for the X-Division title- This was easily the match of the night and a match of the year candidate. This was when Joe had just turned heel so there was a lot of bad blood going into this match and the crowd loved it. Also at this time Joe still had a undefeated streak on the line. The match started with A.J. controlling it but than Joe fought back. He nailed styles with tons of kicks to the face. There was just a lot of high flying moves and near falls including when Styles hit his finisher on Joe but Joe kicked out. Just a great match enjoyed by all. Winner and new X-Division champ Samoa Joe. Match Rating 9.5/10.

9. Jeff Jarret vs. Rhino for the NWA title- This was a decent main event. I would have rather seen Joe styles in the main event but this was still very good. They had a few matches before this but this was about the same. Not much to say just a average main event but nothing to bad tough to watch Jarret win again. Winner and still NWA champ Jeff Jarret. Match Rating 7/10.

Well that raps up another. I would give Turning Point 2005 a grade of 66/90 which means this is a awesome PPV. There was nothing awful on this card and a match of the year candidate. SO I think you should pick this up. If you can tell me if my review was helpful or not I would appreciate that. Thanks for your time.",1176595200,4,4817,4.1270010672358595
8158816,4,B000KRMSFS,"Turning Point 2005 was another good showing of PPV's from Total Non-Stop Action as this PPV had a mix of things for everyone's taste.

Barbed Wire Massacre: Sabu vs. Abyss - This match was just sick as you see moments like Sabu getting dropped on his neck into the barbed wire and Abyss squished inbetween two barbed wire boards. It's not as distubring as Sabu's last two barbed wire matches (Hardcore Homecoming & vs. Terry Funk) but it still leaves an impression.

Matt Bentley & Austin Aries vs. Alex Shelley & Roderick Strong - You can't go wrong with an X division tag team match & this is no exception as they're always right on the money.

Raven vs. Chris K. (Kanyon) - Again, just another wrestling match from Raven that really got dull at times with the inring storytelling from Raven & didn't do a good job of following up the previous matches.

4Life Kru vs. Team Canada - This match was just a backdrop to the big story of Konnan's heel turn & the breakup of the Kru which was being set up for months.

Basebrawl: Sonjay Dutt, Chris Sabin, Dale Torborg (a.k.a. The Demon from WCW) w/White Sox member AJ Pierzynski vs. Diamonds In The Rough - The match itself was good as you can't miss with Sabin & Dutt while the Diamonds are very underrated wrestlers.  Bobby Heenan returns to commentary & he didn't miss a step.

Christian Cage vs. Monty Brown - This was better than their rematch at Destination X months later as Christian was able to work with Monty (which is no secret that he's limited in what he can do in the ring) to bring forth a great match.

Tables Match: AMW vs. Team 3D - Eventhough the DVD case says this was a title match, it wasn't.  This was the best showing between these two teams as they brawled & wrestled while coming up with creative ways to set up & move the tables during the match.

X Division Champion AJ Styles vs. Samoa Joe - It's no secret that the series between these two & Christopher Daniels were the talk of professional wrestling for a year & this match was no exception.  AJ had a chunk of his lip busted open & still fought hard against Samoa Joe.  The match of the night no questions asked.

NWA Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Rhino - This match was the sterotypical formula of a Jarrett match.  Wrestling, a big brawl throughout the arena, and an overload of outside interference.  The match with the wrestling & brawling was actually very well but the match took a turn for the worst when ALL members of Team Canada kept interfearing in the end to cost Rhino the match.  However, the big suprize here at the end was the tease of Sting coming to TNA with his bat, coat, and boots left in the middle of the ring.

Bottom line is that again, there wasn't a bad match here & it had something for everyone so I highly recommend this PPV from TNA.",1169596800,11,2791,4.377906976744186
