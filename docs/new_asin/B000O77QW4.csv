2791758,4,B000O77QW4,"It's rare to see a scientist like Stanton Friedman make a rational argument in favor of the existence of UFOs. While I'm still not 100 percent convinced they exist, or that one crashed in July 1947 near Roswell, New Mexico, Friedman's arguments are logical and well-reasoned. Well worth watching, even for skeptics.",1365811200,5,315,5.076923076923077
2791759,1,B000O77QW4,An embarrassingly poor quality video that barely deserves to be posted to Youtube for free. Do not pay for this. I only clicked on it because it is included with my account for free. People ought to get paid to endure this garbage. Amazon.com should remove it.,1365379200,2,260,4.553191489361702
2791760,4,B000O77QW4,This is a lecture type video. Not the best quality visually but the information is good and concise. It is in a linear story-like format. Almost like an audio-book. I did not know much about the specifics or the wide picture of Roswell. This is good for starters.,1360368000,,263,4.5
2791761,1,B000O77QW4,"Some documentary. Basically an hour and a half of speculation, poor video quality, and non sequitur slides that don't accomplish anything. There is no real evidence here.",1357948800,2,170,5.333333333333333
2791762,5,B000O77QW4,"Great compilation of evidence that was gathered in a most professional manner.  This video is basically a lecture given in a college setting describing the uncovering of information around two UFO crashes (both with alien bodies) in New Mexico in '47.  Worth watching if you are interested in learning about the government cover-up or about alien existance.  I hope that the public begins to pay attention to the lack of freedom of information we truly have as shown in the blacked out documents that were released by various government agencies under the Freedom of Information Act (and many court battles) toward the end of the film.

If you are looking for ""entertainment,"" look elsewhere.  If for education, this is a great one to watch.",1355961600,7,741,4.943548387096774

2791784,1,B000O77QW4,"What a rip-off. Stands in front of an old VHS camera with really bad picture, sound and lighting while blabbing. This guy was raking in $20.00 bucks each, as it reads. He wanted that price printed right there, baby. This guy SHOULD believe flying saucers are zipping around him...",1424476800,,280,4.73469387755102
2791785,4,B000O77QW4,Very in formative and interesting in spite of the worn out topic of Roswell UFO encounter.  Stanton Friedman is probably one of the best authorities on UFOs or as many call then Flying Saucers.,1421452800,,193,4.676470588235294
2791786,4,B000O77QW4,"A classic example of catch 22.
Either this guy is right.
Or this guy is wrong.

Which one do you choose.
Our government being 100% truthful?
Or our government hiding 100% of the truth?

Choose wisely.",1415750400,,200,4.527777777777778
2791787,5,B000O77QW4,Excellent video.,1412121600,,16,7.5

2791790,4,B000O77QW4,"Good general overview of the UFO phenomenon, this video attempts to tell the truth concerning these unusual crafts and the U.S. governments involvement in keeping them a closely guarded secret.

To continue the USA has a anti-gravity technology program testing prototypes for many decades. Most of what is seen in the sky's are those crafts. However The evidence is over whelming that this planet is visited by alien space craft for a so very long time.
Most people won't believe but if you have been a person  to see such a craft you will know the truth!
Most people are too busy to just look up at the sky. If you do now and then you might see something amazing.",1405382400,,664,4.525
2791791,2,B000O77QW4,it is all junk  not worth my time. please do not watch this movie it is all hooked up real junk,1404086400,,95,3.5238095238095237
2791792,3,B000O77QW4,"Good in-depth detail if you want to hear more about Roswell and the series of events that occurred in 1947, personally I've heard enough about it.  Stanton Friedman is speaking to an audience in a small conf. room w/a slide projector that seems to have some control or operator issues but he makes it very clear that the American people have been totally misled and actually lied to by our government on the subject of unidentified flying craft.  I was hoping for something ""new"" not the same old 1947 hot air balloon nonsense that we have been fed before - Very good detail but it's an old story and the delivery was sub par to me, that's why I gave it 3 stars.",1403222400,,662,4.373983739837398
2791813,3,B000O77QW4,"On the whole I find Stanton Friedman to be a fairly diligent researcher and he speaks with conviction but this entire movie looks like a High School one-camera shoot of him giving a presentation of material on mostly the Roswell Incident in 1947 at some New-Age gathering 'sometime', 'somewhere' and not much in the way of any new revelatory information but there are a couple of tidbits that are interesting for the uninitiated or those who may have only casually followed the modern UFO phenomenon.",1399248000,,500,4.894117647058824
2791814,4,B000O77QW4,"This is a lecture by Stanton Friedmab who is one of the worlds most respect authorities on this subject. Although the filming leaves a lot to be desired, the content is excellent and reflects a long history of research into the topic.",1397952000,,234,4.595238095238095
2791815,5,B000O77QW4,"Most of my questions about alien life on earth were answered. I recommend this video. I was a skeptic, but no longer.",1394582400,,117,4.363636363636363
2791816,4,B000O77QW4,"Incredible.  For years watching and waiting and yet the government lied and lied. Miraculous that the events and thousands of
videos and every fiber of our being cried out for truth.  The evidence speaks for itself. Knowing personally that people witnessed
events however, hidden from the population through fear tactics.  Atlas, the truth is unfolding whether the powers that be ,admit
the incredible truth or not, the truth will be visible.  So much to learn, it would take multiple lifetimes but peace to the soul to know.",1394064000,,525,5.0
2791817,1,B000O77QW4,"This is nothing but a poorly filmed lecture. Quality is subzero and the sound is awful.  Slides on screen that you
can't often see. Content aside this highly overrated due to presentation.",1391558400,,188,4.875
2791818,5,B000O77QW4,"This video is a must for anyone interested in the truth about the Roswell incident in 1947.  Stanton Friedman is one of the best researchers of UFO material, and his presentation is excellent!",1390176000,,192,4.818181818181818
2791819,3,B000O77QW4,"I'm not sure exactly what to call this. I viewed this as a freebee under Amazon Prime. It is obviously a lecture, not a video program. Sort of like what you would see on a cable TV local access community channel. Old school slides are used that need focusing so don't expect fancy computer graphics or 1080P HD resolution. In this program I learned more about the education and background of Stanton Friedman who has embraced the study of UFO's as a major part of his life. The program is really about him and his UFO beliefs.

UFOlogy has been lacking in hard definitive evidence. It relies excessively on 2nd and 3rd generation versions of reported events. Example the Barney and Betty Hill abduction story is well known in UFO lore. Under regression hypnosis Betty Hill ""produced"" a ""star map"" that is the home system of the alien abductors. Stanton goes into a lot of detail on the astronomy of this star map. Explaining the distances and physics involved.

I wish more research had gone into the details of the regression hypnosis of Betty and Barney Hill. A period of three years had passed from the date of the ""abduction"" and the first of several clinical sessions. Dr Simon who performed the sessions stated that Betty and Barney had very different accounts of the ""ufo experience"". The doctor believed the abduction to be too improbable and much of the material was similar to dream material. These important detail has not been shared by the UFO community. Is this the cosmic conspiracy?

I'm interested in the motivation and reasoning behind people beliefs on this subject. I'm okay with this video recording of a ""real lecture"" as it has a historical time line quality to it. If it were in black and white, subtitles, and a softer focus it would be even better.

I suggest you watch an early  'X-Files"" episode or two then follow it up with this presentation. Then you might appreciate it better.

Look to the skies.",1381968000,8,1929,4.6923076923076925
2791820,5,B000O77QW4,It really gets me angry that only a few educated and powerful people get to run this US of A. The rest of us are labeled terrorists if we know the truth.,1379548800,2,153,3.8125
2791821,5,B000O77QW4,"Provocative lecture on the topic of unidentified flying objects, UFOS.  Wow, and it is an eye opener, as the very knowledgeable lecturer reveals unequivocal evidence to the existence of UFOS.  The lecturer is only one of the foremost ufologists of our time, a true expert in his field of study.  This is a must see for everyone.  I suggest taking notes during the lecture as the topic is quite in depth.",1377734400,2,403,4.633802816901408

8183520,4,B000O77QW4,"It is so amazing to see the released document by the government on the matter of UFOs or UAPs that were all black out.  If these phenomena are of no important to the government, how come they do not let the public know of their investigations and what they been collecting for over 5 decades? The more they hide the truth, the more they make people wonder about the secrecy!",1458000000,,374,4.3428571428571425

I found his methods for trying to ferret out the truths from witnesses very interesting.  It helps to have read his book, ""Crash At Corona' in order to be able to follow the information given here.",1436572800,,368,4.630769230769231

8183526,5,B000O77QW4,"Poor production values but definitely worth watching if you haven't heard Stanton drone on before on this particular subject. If you can get over his sometimes condescending, ""George Constanza"" meets your 5th grade teacher shtick (""I'm not a UFOlogist Apologist"" or ""Absence of Evidence does not mean Evidence of Absence"")...you do have a reasonably brilliant man making a tremendous case for the truth - and we do all owe Constanza here a debt of enormous magnitude and gratitude - for without him, we would know a hell of a lot less than we do about the subject of UFOs/Aliens - and Roswell in partiulcar. In fact, we might just know absolutely nothing.

In addition - he's not a New Ager, and doesn't take anything on faith. He investigates and does apply rationality to his investigations. I read his MJ 12 reports and I was shocked by the level of detail and consideration.",1431302400,,878,4.776315789473684
8183527,1,B000O77QW4,"There is no way to describe this ""lecture"". Boring, poorly shot, and if you're into all things UFO, well then he's not saying anything that hasn't been heard before.",1428796800,,165,4.724137931034483
