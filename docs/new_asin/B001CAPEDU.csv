3506940,5,B001CAPEDU,"I loved the comfortable, yet challenging, flow of this yoga sequence.  Surya's calming presence and easy to understand instruction really helped me to focus more on using the breath to move more easily and comfortably into any posture.  Beautiful location too, creating a very relaxing environment free of distractions. Definitely going to be giving this one as a gift!",1216166400,10,369,5.237288135593221
8286332,5,B001CAPEDU,"Very nice. I was looking for something that was a little more challenging than a beginners dvd. This wasn't too challenging, but much better than others I've bought.",1445558400,,165,4.928571428571429
8286333,5,B001CAPEDU,Good but be sure you are familiar with Yoga. I've taken a lot of Yoga and some of these poses are not for the beginning practioner. Easily hurt if you aren't familiar.,1438387200,,167,4.25
8286334,4,B001CAPEDU,EXCELLENT CHOICE! ONE OF THE BEST AMONG MANY I HAVE BOUGHT,1426636800,,58,4.363636363636363
8286335,5,B001CAPEDU,"I normally do power yoga and ashtanga. This has been a delightful change of pace for me.  The relaxing atmosphere, coupled with the perfect background music and an almost ideal instructor's voice makes this a great dvd.

In my opinion, this is not a beginner's dvd.  There are some poses that should only be done if you're in good health, and you have good balance.  At the very least you should have some class room instruction covering the basic poses.

All in all, I am quite happy with my purchase and look forward to revisiting this dvd when I need a relaxing routine.",1388361600,,573,4.524271844660194
8286336,3,B001CAPEDU,"I was hoping for more, the DVD is shot in alot of shade making it hard to see what he is actually doing.  The audio is also hard to understand at times.",1377907200,,152,3.75
8286337,5,B001CAPEDU,"Surya really helped me develop my practice, and take it home.  I hope someday soon he will put together a second more advanced DVD.  But i will still come back to this one, for a terrific hour long practice.",1373500800,,207,4.282051282051282
8286338,5,B001CAPEDU,I love this. Great instruction - clear and easy to understand. Excellent overall practice with a nice mix of poses. The breathing exercises are a great bonus. Nice pace --  neither too slow or too fast.,1357776000,,202,4.611111111111111
8286339,5,B001CAPEDU,"Dynamic Hatha Yoga with Surya Surya Kolpakov provides, as I mentioned, relaxing, very easy to follow instructions, with a good workout.  When you're done, you're feeling good, and ready for the day.",1303430400,,198,5.1875
8286340,5,B001CAPEDU,I have been using this DVD for about 3 months now and must say that I am very pleased with it.  The instructor provides a thorough workout but never rushes.  He gives clear explanations as to how one should move into and hold a posture and I feel like I've had an invigorating workout each time I work through it.  There is nice background music which appropriate and relaxing.  I own half a dozen yoga DVDs but this one is by far my favorite.,1239926400,12,443,4.238095238095238
8286341,5,B001CAPEDU,"This yoga video is a great way to start the day.  The class is gentle and warming, leaving you alert and refreshed!  The breathing exercises are a great bonus. Surya's voice is gentle and his instructions are clear and concise.  What I really like is that you will find that you won't need to watch and you can just concentrate on your practice!  To me there is nothing more distracting than poor instruction that makes me need to look up at my television in the middle of a pose:)  I think this DVD is a must for new and practiced Yogis alike!",1219622400,17,544,4.294117647058823
