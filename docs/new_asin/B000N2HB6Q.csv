2752676,5,B000N2HB6Q,"Review of ""Lock On: Joint Locking Essentials: The Comprehensive Guide To Joint Locks - Volume I Wrist Locks"" with Alain Burrese.

I have known of Alain Burrese as a Hapkido practitioner for years but have never had the honor of watching him train.  He is one of the core members of modern warriors active in martial arts who are consistently training and teaching (akin to Shawn Kovacich).  His consistency, in my opinion, is the benchmark of credibility.  During the near decade when I was a defensive/control tactics instructor for a municipal police department the fundamentals of wrist locks were foundational principles necessary to controlling a subject during the contact of actual physical arrest.  These principles were more difficult to teach to individuals in medium and large groups because of the small movement techniques involved.  In short, the student needed to be up close and personal if not being actively used as a uke.  Alain's instructional does exactly that.  It focuses on the movement at both within personal space and from a distance outside of that.  Using standard half speed and half power movements the student is taught the basics of wrist locks.  This video instructs on the core basics.  However, it is the core basics that all law enforcement officers need to master.  Anything beyond that is useful, but not necessary toward effecting an arrest.  I cannot stress this statement enough: This IS the instructional video to start with to give anyone, particularly LEO's, the confidence necessary to gain control of a resisting or potentially violent subject.  Volume I chapters consist of: 1. Introduction; 2. Explanation of the wrist; 3. Outer wrist lock; 4. Inner wrist lock; 5. Overhand outer wrist lock; 6. Reverse handshake; 7. Standing center lock; 8. ""S"" locks; 9. Faucet lock; and 10. Conclusion.  I wish I had this DVD when I was a police officer.  I am glad that I own it now and recommend this important video to all law enforcement officers desiring to improve their skills and by default their own personal safety on the job.  Absolute five star rating.  Well done.

2752677,5,B000N2HB6Q,"I'm a real fan of joint locks. I used them on the street as a cop for 25 years and I have taught them for over 45 years as a martial arts instructor. To those who say that joint locks don't work on the street, I say: Apparently yours don't, but mine have and I know that Alan Burrese's do, too.

Alan teaches and demonstrates each of his techniques in a clear and understandable way. There is no wasted verbiage and no wasted time as he carefully outlines not only how to do the techniques but explains why they hurt. In some, he shows how easy it would be to break the joint.

I knew many of the techniques Alan shows. With those I did know, I learned new nuances that made the familiar technique hurt even more. The ones I didn't know, Alan explained the steps so well that I was able to stand up and apply the move perfectly the first time. That's how well-taught these techniques are.

I highly recommend this DVD to add some new twists to techniques that might be familiar to you and to learn new ones that will have a street attacker kissing the concrete.

2752678,5,B000N2HB6Q,"Lock On with Alain Burrese, Wrist locks volume one

 Alain Burrese and Aiki Productions have done it again  with their first volume in ""Joint Locking  Essentials, Wrist Locks""  I was impressed by the production and audio quality of this DVD and it is shot without all the pretentious and useless additions that most instructional DVD's are riddled with. That in itself is a big plus in my eyes.

 What I really like about this first volume and the other ones I have watched from Aiki Productions is the total lack of BS. No jumping around screaming , no chest beating this is the ultimate martial arts style and you don't need anything else. Alain's teaching and down to earth instructions lay out the simple fundamentals and the basics of applying wrist locks. I have spent the better part of twenty-two years working as a bouncer in some of the roughest clubs in Texas and other states , and I can verify that these applications work in a real world situation. Since the advent of so-called RBSD and Ultimate Fighting MMA styles most people have moved to a less technique oriented style and  drifted away from simple drills and skills in learning  how to apply the right technique at the right time. They have listened to the ""gurus and masters"" tell them that most fights go to the ground. If you go to the ground intentionally more than likely one of your opponents friends is goinig to kick you in the head or slip a knife into your back. In this and the other videos I have watched from Alain Burrese you begin to understand the simple fundamentals of a stand up game.

 I would strongly recommend this entire series to anyone that works in a high risk or potentially dangerous job. Bouncer, prison guard, police officer, or anyone wanting to sharpen their self defense skills and safety. That being said unless you practice what is taught in this DVD it will absolutely do nothing for you when the time comes to use it. Find a partner, watch and train each section until it become second nature, slow down and learn how to do it correctly. Then as you develop the skill speed up but be safe and don't hurt each other.

2752679,5,B000N2HB6Q,"Lock on:  Joint Locking Essentials with Alain Burrese Volume 1 contains a lot of information and good information too.  Having watched Taiji Chin Na In Depth by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming just a day or two prior to seeing Lock On with Mr. Burrese was a fascinating contrast. Classic Chinese applications from Dr. Yang and Mr. Burrese's Former security professional and Hapkido black belt take on the techniques is a great contrast, but more about Lock On.  Lock on Vol. 1 is dedicated to wrist locks, the way they are applied and the way they work. The production of the DVD is nice, not too much, not too little, easy to navigate and clear.  Reverse angles and slow motion are used well.  When I look at an instructional DVD, I am always asking myself, ""How long will it take for me to get to the floor?"" The answer is not long with the way Mr. Burrese is teaching.  Of course competency in the technique is a different story, however with Lock on:  Joint Locking Essentials with Alain Burrese Volume 1 and some diligence, you are well on your way to knowing more about the complications and subtleties of wrist locks.",1272844800,,1113,4.562814070351759

2752681,5,B000N2HB6Q,"who wishes to know about the joint locks properly and may not have a Hapkido school in their city,these joint locks dvds of Mr. Alain Burrese are like finding a treasure.
The instructions are simple, to the point. Joint locks are explained with the help of slow motion actions, close ups etc. Esecially the usage of same lock in different situations like, clothing grab, wrist grab, offensive techniques helps to understand the lock perectly.",1245628800,2,442,4.986486486486487
2752682,5,B000N2HB6Q,"OK, all of us have done it!  We've purchased DVDs that seem to offer clear insight and instruction regarding specific techniques used in our forms of martial arts.  Yet, how many of us have been disappointed to find that the not-so-clear presentations have been poorly illustrated and sequenced?

Alain Burrese brings to this DVD an entirely different style of presentation that allows the viewer to see (almost feel) the techniques being illustrated.  Burrese presents his selection of joint locks within the framework of grounded martial arts practices, so the techniques are never simply isolated movements.  Yet, his presentation also allows one to see the details of hand placement, footwork, body positioning, etc. that provide the real power for the execution of these techniques.

Burrese has a strong sense of presence in front of the camera, and this dramatically improves the quality of his instruction.  Not only are the wrist locks clearly explained and illustrated, but they are also reinforced by Burrese's teaching style, which always includes a summary of what he presents.  The camera moves in for close details of each technique after showing the viewer an overall view.  Consequently, Burrese never forgets to emphasize that the techniques are rooted firmed in martial arts practices.  Yet, Burrese goes further by showing the extreme power of each technique, something that many instructors in dojos are not willing to demonstrate.

These techniques are, indeed, powerful tools and should be practiced carefully with a partner.  They are intended for close, confrontational situations, which are usually the real-life situations where defense is needed.  Nothing fancy here.  Just straightforward techniques that work.  I've used some of them before to stop more escalated fight situations, so I know they work.  Alain Burrese presents them with the clarity that most instructors cannot.

As I understand it, the ""Lock On"" series will be comprised of five DVDs, maybe six.  If the rest of the series is anything like this one, they will constitute a classic collection for martial artists practicing any form.  Furthermore, one should know that Burrese shows these defense practices  because they work for anyone, who can maintain the fundamental concepts of martial arts while executing these techniques.  I first encountered Alain Buresse's presentations in a DVD entitled ""Streetfighting Essentials.""  I found this to be an invaluable resource, because Burrese was able to bridge the distance between dojo instruction of martial arts and real-life street situations that require quick, spontaneous execution of defense strategies that allow one to survive.  With this in mind, I purchased volume I of the ""Lock On"" series and was pleased to find that Burrese still emphasizes that martial arts practice needs to keep the fighting intent foremost, even after we develop a more philosophical approach to the forms we study.

""Lock On: Joint Locking Essentials Volume 1"" is an invaluable instructional DVD for any martial artist.  I expect to see many more DVDs by this Hapkido practitioner, simply because he knows what he is doing and knows how to present this knowledge to others clearly through his combination of words and images.  This is a professionally produced DVD that I will use for many years.  Thank you, Alain, for sharing your skills.",1180137600,9,3371,5.299435028248587
2752683,5,B000N2HB6Q,"One of the first things that jumped out at me from the onset when I started watching Alain's ""Lock On"" series of DVD's was the simple yet effective approach that he took in the production and presentation of this series of DVD's. My initial impression was one of being in an actual seminar environment while Alain was teaching instead of merely watching an instructional DVD. You won't find any pointless or ineffective ""bells and whistles"" with this series; instead what you will find is good quality instruction covering a wide array of joint locking techniques. This particular DVD focuses on wrist locking techniques.

Alain's ability to instruct you on these simple, yet effective wrist locking techniques is the hallmark of a good instructor and it certainly shows in this series. Alain's approach is straightforward and easy to follow as he takes you through each wrist lock numerous times in order to teach you how to execute each technique correctly. Alain takes great care in his teachings to explain to you how some of these techniques although they may appear to be ineffective, can actually be quite effective if applied under the right set of circumstances.

I'm going to take a brief moment here to jump ahead to the end of this DVD where Alain explains the three (3) key elements that need to be present in order for these techniques to be effective. Although each one of these key elements is vitally important in their own right, none of them is exclusive in importance to the others when it comes to applying these wrist locks effectively in a combat or self-defense situation. What you have to remember is that these three (3) key elements have to be combined in order to form a symbiotic entity that is only effective when utilized together in an efficient manner.

These three (3) key elements are as follows:

1. Surprise: If your opponent doesn't know what to expect, he is going to have a more difficult time defending against it. However, if your opponent knows what is coming, he is going to be more readily able to counter it, or avoid it all together.

2. Speed: Executing the techniques shown on this DVD has to be done as fast as possible while still retaining the third key element, which is proper technique. If the technique is executed too slowly, then your opponent will have the opportunity to figure out what you are doing and, as in the case of surprise, be able to counter it or avoid the technique all together.

3. Proper Technique: This should literally be a ""no-brainer,"" but unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case. I don't know how many times I have personally seen or heard of someone trying to apply a particular technique in a given self-defense type situation when they weren't even executing the technique correctly to begin with. Alain goes to extreme lengths in this series to implore you to practice, practice, and practice, until the techniques he demonstrates become second nature to you where you can execute them correctly without thought or hesitation.

Alain follows the same instructional format for each one of the various wrist locks shown in this DVD. He starts out by explaining some of the finer points of executing each technique followed by various follow up techniques that can be used on your opponent, if it is needed, after the wrist lock has been applied. He then shows several variations of each wrist lock that all are based on the primary wrist lock that was first shown.

Alain takes a very realistic approach to the use of wrist locks and attempts to cover several influencing factors that may or may not come into play while attempting to apply them in a real life situation. I myself watched this DVD on three separate occasions and found something that I had previously missed each time. I have no doubt that were I to watch this DVD again after writing this review that I would find something else that I had previously missed.

One of the many great things that I really enjoy about Alain's teaching style is his, what I like to refer to as, ""nuggets of wisdom"" that he injects throughout his instruction process. I too use this in my own personal style of teaching and have found that it is very effective teaching technique.

I have a rather large collection of instructional videos that I have accumulate over the years and I can say without reservation that Alain's ""Lock On"" series is one of the best I have seen so far on the subject of joint techniques. If I were to have only one comment to make on this series, it would be this, ""Hurry up and make the rest of them!""",1176854400,6,4565,4.687890137328339
2752684,5,B000N2HB6Q,"One thing I've personally enjoyed about all of Burrese's body of work is his no-nonsense way of presentation. From Hard Won Wisdom to Hapkido Hoshinsul, From Street Fighting Essentials to the new Lock On Series, Burrese simply knows self defense.

I was excited to receive the evaluation copy of Master Burrese's new Lock On series of Hapkido Instructional DVDs. As usual, there was no let down.

Throughout, Burrese keeps safety in mind. He reminds the viewer that respect for one's training partner is key. Many instructors forget this point, which could cause problems during practice.

Another bonus of Burrese's work is that he packs as much information as possible into one DVD. Unlike other production companies which use fillers like promos for their other products, Burrese and Aiki Productions cram as much knowledge into each DVD as possible. As always, you get the biggest bang for your buck.

The Lock On Series isn't simply for the novice practitioner. Even the seasoned Hapkidoin will find great material here as well as a good reference source. The novice will find clear, precision instruction on basics, controlling and finishing techniques. The expert will find an invaluable reference on fundamental and advanced techniques and tweaks.

When watching Burrese in action, you'll notice his flow and control. Flowing, making a technique fluid and not choppy or hopping around trying to make it work, is essential in Hapkido. Burrese embodies that concept. He emphasizes proper footwork, an oft forgotten key, and whole body technique. He takes time to explain mechanics, a must for Hapkido.

This isn't a simple run-down of locking techniques. This IS a Master Instructor taking the time to show you step-by-step guidance towards mastery.

Kudos to Aiki Productions on clear video and audio quality. Audio quality is often lacking with many manufacturers. Aiki does an excellent job here with that as well as the graphical interface of the DVD.

2752685,5,B000N2HB6Q,"With so many martial arts videos and resources out there, the bar has been set pretty high for new material. Alain Burrese sets the standard even higher. This first ""Lock On"" DVD is a good example of providing a lot of material in a quality manner at a fair price. The DVD runs 87 minutes of solid content.

The ""Lock On"" project is a very ambitious one. It seems to be designed to focus on Hapkido joint locks without having to get too deep into the striking aspect, the footwork aspect, falls, breathing, finishes and so on. Granted, there has to be some of this to make the locks work out of ""isolation"" but the 1st video sets a good model.

The DVD is arranged clearly into several chapters, making it very easy to reference and skip around. It starts with a nice exploration of the wrist and some great insight on why wrist locks work the way they do. From there are sections on various locks, including the outer wrist lock, inner wrist lock, overhand outer wrist lock, reverse handshake, standing center lock, s-lock, and the faucet lock.

In each section the lock is explored in a general static sense, with attention paid to the mechanics, then it's shown more dynamically in a variety of situations (like lapel grab, same side wrist grab, etc) with several variations depending on footwork and attacker's intent. Key elements such as footwork, posture, and even finishes are explored to a degree necessary for the technique but not to distraction.

Most of the variations are the old tried and true ones but there were some original ones I really liked as well. There are a few variations I didn't personally care for, such as the jumping locks and the deep crouches, but the mechanics were interesting to see even then. Also, I had never learned the ""faucet lock"" before but seeing the application of it in the clinch makes me curious about it and I'll try it out on someone soon.

Overall, the production values are very good, with clear photography, good angles and very good verbal descriptions. Attention is paid to more than just the lock, getting into how to shift weight, use the whole body and proper mechanics without getting too abstract and while trying to keep the focus on the locks. The video doesn't pretend to be an ""end-all be-all"" representation of Hapkido and it sticks closely to its clearly stated goals of exploring wrist locks. There seems to be elements from different Hapkido traditions represented in the variations and this makes it very educational for students of the art.

On a similar note, I like how the material is presented with a stark lack of propaganda that sometimes can be seen in Hapkido videos. He doesn't go overboard in extolling the virtues of the art or in specific lineages and/or purity. The material is presented as its own justification for learning it. I look forward to the second volume and would be interested to see other elements of Hapkido explored in similar ways (e.g. breakfalls, strikes, footwork, etc).

At first glance, people might assume this is ""just"" a reference for new Hapkido practitioners. This isn't true. The way this DVD is presented makes it a great resource for all levels. For a new HKD student (or even for a student who learns joint locks as part of a Taekwondo Hoshinsool program) this is a nice supplement to classroom instruction on how a lock works and how to do it. For a ""new"" instructor this provides an excellent resource on how to teach locks and focus on how to ""get everything right"". For a senior or master instructor, aside from the solid instructional reference, there are enough little variations and ideas to make it worthwhile as well. Best of all, by not being ""kwan-specific"" it can serve as a great tool for all Hapkido kwans and Hapkido-based arts as well as for those school who use Hapkido or Hapkido elements in their self defense programs (like many TKD schools do).

Overall, I highly recommend this volume for students and instructors alike. The price is fairly average for martial arts videos but it packs a lot more material in than most others do. There is a lot of general reference that is usable by all levels and enough ""extra"" that will interest seasoned instructors as well.",1173052800,6,4200,4.712534059945504

The physical techniques are shown both slowly while explaining all the details that make it effective, and at real speed to show how it should look when done for real.
It is obvious that Alain is an expert in joint locking techniques, and no wonder when you consider his background: 4th degree black belt in Hapkido and experience working security as a security officer!
""Never grab a Hapkido person"", (mentioned in volume two) I love that phrase and Alain's excellent instruction and techniques motivate me to start training in Hapkido again!

He goes into detail about executing wrist locks in a variety of situations and I appreciated his clear presentation.  On one point I have to disagree.  He demonstrates wrist locks on someone trying to punch you. The idea of catching a punch is just not realistic.

8174030,5,B000N2HB6Q,"Lock On, Joint Locking Essentials, The Comprehensive guide to Joint Locks Volume 1; Wrist locks.

This excellent DVD is produced by self-defence and Hapkido Expert Alain Burrese is the first volume in a series of DVD's about joint locks.

The DVD starts off with an intro with Alain explaining the scope and focus of this DVD namely wrist locks.  He explains that whilst it's not possible to show every existing wristlock in the DVD he wil show a large enough variety to enable the viewer to learn the principles and an understanding of how these locks work.  With this the viewer can go away and create his own variations and applications.

Before learning how to screw something up we have to know how it's supposed t work so next Alain moves into how the wrist works from a mechanical point of view and what causes the pain when a lock is applied.

With this understanding Alain moves into the techniques, starting with a technique called outer wristlock.  The techniques is first explained from a simple attack like a wrist grab where Alain shows an overview of the body mechanics and the footwork for the technique.  Then after the general gross motor skills of the technique are shown the camera zooms in and Alain goes into a more detailed explanation about what the hands are doing with proper hand positioning and other details.  After the explanations the techniques are shown again but in a more dynamic way which is a beauty to the eye and makes you want to go straight out and practice.

After the basic technique is shown and the principles explained variations are shown as well as how to apply the technique against other attacks.  A bonus to me is that Alain also shows how to use these techniques in an offensive way as we all know that action beats reaction.

Now we know how Alain explains his techniques the DVD picks up speed and we move into other techniques.  All other techniques have the same clear build up explaining the principles in a easy to understand way.

What I like is that the DVD is for every martial artist who wants to learn about wristlocks as the terminology is in English and the execution is in a universal way rather than an aikido way, a hapkido, a Chin Na way etc...

After showing eight different locks and their variations the DVD ends with a conclusion wherein Alain gives some final comments and explains the three important key elements to make a lock work.  He also expresses his thanks to the people who made this DVD possible and wishes the viewer a nice and safe practise.

As an aikidoka I enjoyed this DVD very much as I saw things from another angle and also saw some new moves.  As said I liked the universal approach wherein the technique isn't wrong as long as the principles are applied correct.  Another thing I liked is that some locks are shown in a  less traditional situation like a sparring situation and the clinch.

As Alain explained in the intro, wristlocks are one aspect of martial arts, it's still important to know how to punch, kick and grapple.  To learn about wrist locks this is the DVD.

To conclude this DVD is a must see for any martial artist who wants to be a more complete fighter.",1366848000,,3168,4.568141592920354
8174031,5,B000N2HB6Q,"I have all of  Alain Burrese's DVDs, I cannot speak more highly of an instructor.
I have had training in Aikido, Kosho Ryu Kempo and finger locks, and  Pressure Points.  Alain's detail explanations are the best.  I've had some problems in the past with hand placement his slow detailed explanations have helped my understanding.

Everytime I watch a DVD I pickup some little adjustment that I might have missed.

I am patiently waiting for his next DVD ...

I am not a student of  Alain Burrese, sure wish I could have been.",1335398400,,524,4.619565217391305
8174032,5,B000N2HB6Q,"Alain Burrese is the man. I've been doing the elevated wrist lock, or what Alain calls the standing center lock (Mochi Mowari or Sankyo for you Japanese stylists) for years, including many variations from both Hapkido and Jujitsu. But Burrese, defending against a straight punch, shows an entry to the lock that is so fast and smooth, that when I saw it I whistled out loud. It's not a complex transition, but Burrese applies it with a rapid, smooth entry that goes from punch to lock to throw in about a second. He also shows entries for this lock that do not require going under the arm and turning your back to your opponent as is traditionally done. He shows a nice little ""dance drill"" for practicing the lock. And much more, really.

In this first volume of his must-have ""Lock On"" series, Burrese first offers a detailed explanation of how the wrist works and how its limitations can be used to lock it up. He then covers wrist locks including the outer wrist lock, inner wrist lock, overhand wrist lock, reverse handshake, standing center lock, s-lock and its variations, and the faucet lock.

The DVD is an hour and 26 minutes long, so it's not mega-long, but it's highly specialized, so you get a good amount of material within the subject range.

Every lock is demonstrated in several variations. Burrese explains how each lock works, then demonstrates it slowly, zooming in on the hands when necessary so the viewer can see exactly what is going on, then he demonstrates it at full speed, sometimes from various angles. He shows offensive and defensive variations, and sometimes throws in little partner drills to improve your form or build muscle memory. He demonstrates versions of the lock that can be used to control or pin, or versions that can be employed in a more destructive fashion, according to the situation. He also teaches a variety of finishes once the attacker is on the ground, some of which are strikes and some control pins. However, the finishes are not really the focus of the DVD and are demonstrated in perfunctory fashion.

There are some joint locking variations that Burrese does not like, because they are more risky, or harder to apply, or less effective. Nevertheless, he demonstrates these variations, explaining why he does not like them. I really appreciate this. What doesn't work for Burrese may work better for someone else. Further, a student may learn one of those less effective variations somewhere else, and will benefit from having Burrese's insight into them. In fact this is one of the hallmarks of a true and trustworthy scholar, that he teaches theories that he does not agree with along with those he favors.

Burrese's partner in the DVD is a red belt who is obviously experienced and knows how to take a fall. I enjoyed seeing him take some fairly hard air falls off the locks. I also appreciate that he is bigger than Alain. So many martial artists seem to perform demos with partners who are smaller than themselves. Is that an ego thing, not wanting to look short? I don't know, but working with someone larger as Alain does increases credibility in the effectiveness of the techniques.

Burrese's careful and detailed approach makes it possible to learn from this DVD even if you've never done martial arts. Just get a practice partner and go through the locks one at at time, slowly, doing them in a relaxed way, until you learn the motion. Then increase your speed gradually, always being careful not to injure your partner.

If you are an experienced martial artist I guarantee that you will find plenty of material in this DVD that is interesting, exciting and probably new to you. Whether you are a practitioner of Hapkido, Jujitsu, Chin-na, or some other joint locking and grappling style, or whether you come from a striking background, or even if you are just interested in joint locks and want to increase your repertoire, you really can't go wrong with this set.

I do recommend that you purchase the entire Lock On set, and work them in order. Learning the wrist locks first is ideal, because when you get to volume 2, which covers arm bars, you will find that many arm bars are made more effective by applying a wrist lock at the same time. The same is true for shoulder locks, which are covered in volume three. Many are done with simultaneous wrist locks. So it's best to learn the wrist locks first so that you will have that skill set and can move on to the larger joints.

This review is essentially over at this point. Feel free to stop reading if you have heard enough. But if you're interested, here are a few specific techniques in this DVD that I found especially exciting:

* Outer Wrist Lock: I like the style of pin that Burrese demonstrates at 16:25, where he folds the arm underneath itself and uses one knee to pin. Against a less flexible person it's highly painful and leaves both hands free to strike or deal with other attackers. I also love the jumping outer wrist lock that he does at 23:45. It's very cool.

* Inner Wrist Lock: I love the smooth transition from punch to lock and pin, all taking about two seconds; shown at 30:20.

* Overhand Outer Wrist Lock: This is a type of gooseneck lock. I've practiced this lock extensively, but had never seen the version with the sit-out fall at 43:15. Basically, Burrese uses a side fall to put the lock on at a speed that would be devastating if the opponent didn't do an air roll. Very interesting. (I would have liked to see the finishing position here, but Burrese had his back to me).

* Reverse Handshake: I've done this lock as an entry to a full twisting arm lock where you go under the arm (as Burrese demonstrates), but I've never seen the abbreviated version before. I think it's very handy in case the opponent bends his arm so you can't go under.

* Standing Center Lock: I had never seen the highly destructive variation against a bear hug from behind, in which you break the attacker's grip, grab the cross hand and go under, then keep it horizontal as you whip it beneath his arm.

* S Locks: I like the variation against a double wrist grab, using the elbow, shown at 1:15:00. I've done this against a single grab, but I like this version better as the attack is more realistic.
Faucet Lock: I like the application of the faucet lock from the clinch, shown at 1:22.00 or so.

Those are a few of my favorite moments from the DVD, but it's full of great techniques. I'm on my third viewing and I'm sure I'll consult the DVD often in the future. I recommend it wholeheartedly.",1305763200,4,6533,4.6092943201376935
