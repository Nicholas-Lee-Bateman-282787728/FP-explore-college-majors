Not only does it show the warped tour but it shows behind the sceens things that teach you alot about the musicians.  It's obvious that activism and punk rock are both integral to each other, and it's good to see that musicians are showing kids ways to get involved and change a world that is so screwed up.  I'm glad someone decided to give punk rock more depth. Finally.",1167782400,,482,4.217391304347826
8135372,4,B000GYI3AY,Love it! I have seen a lot of the Warped Tour DVDs and this is now my favorite. The sound and graphics were amazingly cool. and I just have to say that I LOVE Story of the Year so much! Adam is awesome. Is nice to see a new kind of warped movie.,1161561600,2,245,3.641509433962264
8135373,1,B000GYI3AY,"Definately not a Warped Tour Documentry! This is 95% PETA propaganda! Very misleading as a warped tour documentary. If your looking to find a tour DVD with a lot concert footage, this isn't for you. It's pretty much some guy going around trying to get people not to eat meat and stuff with the help of some of the bands featured.

The video is well put together for Peta's sake, but the live footage sound quality is poor. If I had the oppertunity to get my money back, I would ask for twice as much for just having to watch it. Save yourself the trouble and spend your money on a hamburger.",1161302400,12,591,4.276785714285714
8135374,5,B000GYI3AY,"I never write reviews, but I think this DVD is pretty sweet and is def worth cking out. The quality was better than some of the other warped films I have seen. I was glad to see that they included Strike Anywhere--who NEVER ever goes out on warped. Was also awesome to see Bert from the Used play with Bobby Alt.",1160870400,2,312,4.131147540983607
8135375,2,B000GYI3AY,"Well when i got this in the mail i was expecting the usual warped dvd of band interviews and awsome performances. Although, this wasn't what i expected. Instead it was mostly a PETA protest video and nothing about warped tour. They do have some performances but the sound is horrible and its from small bands and really bad bands. If your a PETA follower, but this. If your looking for a good warped dvd with interviews and performances, go somewhere else",1160697600,8,455,4.62962962962963
