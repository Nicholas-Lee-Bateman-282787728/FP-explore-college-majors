1208781,5,B00000F5N1,"This is a great movie. Bette is Queen Elizabeth'

The clothes are just beautiful And it is a wonderful story. Errol Flynn makes a perfect Essex. If you love this period & love Bette this movie is a must.",1115251200,,203,4.205128205128205
1208782,5,B00000F5N1,"Great cast, color and costuming plus brilliant dialogue from playwright Maxwell Anderson.  At least, this is one of the top 100!",1114560000,4,128,5.095238095238095
1208783,5,B00000F5N1,"IF you are an Errol Flynn fan, this is a not-to-miss flick. Everyone raves over Bette Davis' Queen Elizabeth--and don't get me wrong, I like Bette--but it is Flynn's Essex who carries this film for me. And he looks MAAHAVELLLOUS! Bette worked REALLY hard on her performance, and it REALLY shows. Flynn's performance is more natural, like a fresh breeze in the film, especially compared to Davis'. Call me crazy (because it IS hard to imagine), but I actually BELIEVE it when Essex/Errol says he loves Elizabeth--and, THAT is acting. Errol Flynn deserves some credit for more than just looking great in tights--call it charm or call it presence if you don't want to call it ""acting"" but Flynn rescues this film from being laughable. (Olivia deHavilland adds to, but is wasted in, this film. She was forced to work this role into her schedule WHILE she was playing Melanie in GONE WITH THE WIND--no wonder she sued Warner Bros.) Both Flynn and Davis are great fun to watch, but for me, this is Flynn's picture. Certainly no one thought so in 1939, but 65 years later, his performance seems natural and as authentic as possible with this script. I really can't think of any actor who could have done it better--certainly NOT Laurence Olivier, the world's greatest over-actor (in my opinion) whom Davis wanted in the role and would have made this film a joke instead of the great fun that it is. I give the film 5 stars for the joy of watching Errol Flynn in this movie. Let's face it, NOBODY does Flynn better than Flynn (not even Jude Law). He was unique and most definitely at the top of his game in 1939.",1110240000,19,1604,4.592334494773519
1208784,5,B00000F5N1,"In my opinion, this is Bette Davis' best performance, with ""The Little Foxes"" running a close second.  She put a lot of work into this role and it shows; her performance is detailed and well thought-out.  She is in complete command of her instrument here and is not just playing herself, as in ""All About Eve"" and so many of her later roles.  Moreover, the writing in this film is excellent and literate.  The screenplay was adapted from Maxwell Anderson's stage play, which was quite successful on Broadway with Lynn Fontanne playing the Queen.  So many of Bette Davis' films had inferior writing.  Not this one.

Davis runs the gamut of emotions as Elizabeth, from tough-as-nails to quite vulnerable and fragile.  In many scenes, she shakes with emotion.  She completely embodies the love that Elizabeth has for Essex and the pain she feels when that love is thwarted.  There was a lot of tension between Flynn and Davis on the set and this translates well in the film, bringing an electric air between the Queen and Essex.

This role took a lot of guts to play.  Bette was only 30 years old, playing a 60 year old.  She shaved her hairline and eyebrows for the role (& whitened her eyelashes) and dared to look hideous.  However, it's the inner life and emotional colors that make this a great performance.  The make-up does not do the work for her, as it did in ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"".  Her face & body (& voice) are quite expressive and convey a plethora of subtle and complex feelings.  Surely, being the Queen of Warner Bros. helped Davis understand Elizabeth's feeling of being a ""queen"" first and a ""woman"" second.

As mentioned, the dialogue is one of the film's assets.  It is delicious to the ear and can be savored through countless viewings of the film.  The musical score by Erich Korngold is superb, accentuating the dramatic conflict & also underlining the tender, romantic love scenes.  The color photography looks great, especially for 1939.  Also, Errol Flynn is perfectly cast as Essex and is quite natural, sensitive & appealing.  He's never looked better than in this film.  The supporting cast is quite good as well, including Olivia DeHavilland & a young Vincent Price.

Overall, this is a great love story (tragic and doomed).  Do not watch it to get a history lesson.  But if you like good drama, dialogue and tour-de-force acting, watch it and enjoy.

(For some reason, this film was not available on VHS for many years, while many of Bette Davis' lesser films were released...)",1109376000,10,2516,4.735023041474655
1208785,5,B00000F5N1,"'Elizabeth and Essex' is a magnificent,sweeping epic film. The screenplay, based in Maxwell Anderson's  award-winning play of tragic love is beautiful prose. The art direction and cinematogaphy are near perfect. The music and sound direction are flawless. Bette Davis give bravura performance as the legendary queen; she shines brilliantly. The supporting cast is just right. Highly recommended for an evening's enjoyment.",1106438400,4,422,5.918032786885246
1208786,3,B00000F5N1,"Flynn shows little interest in de Havilland as this is ""The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex"", which, personally, looks better to me when I turn the color off!

 De Havilland, who always looks great in what ever shes in, does her best in the short role Warners gave her. Her scene with Flynn is the best in the film, in my opinion. Flynn made up a title for the film ""The Knight and the Lady"", when Davis objected, the writers made up the present title. The finale scene between Davis and Flynn is the only pointless scene.

I think this is a pretty good film, Flynn does an excellent job. Davis only milidly boring. I'm sorry, that's MY oppinion. Her proformance is perfect but she is constently moving.

Of course the script is only flaued only by deHavilland's sickly role, she needed to have a more drawn role than the ten scenes she has. I like Davis's speech on how a Queen must give up everything for her people. Flynn, who does an excellent job at being not intimidated by Davis, seems a little uncomfortable.

I thing that the only real flaw in this film is deHavillands lack of partisipation, they really could have used her to bring up ticket sales back in 1939 and with that it might have beat many of the films from that great year in film history.

 All in all not a bad film, Davis is a bit anti-Flynn but the script is great and the cast is really a dream cast! I wished they would make films like this nowadays.
Really its worthy 4 1/2 out of 5.",1104451200,3,1466,4.3090909090909095
1208787,5,B00000F5N1,"Bette Davis perhaps did better work, many would argue. But I find that her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth I in this 1939 film was a strong performance. She was such a good actress, she truly focused her energy into becoming the historic queen. She looks the part- white rouge, red hair, dominant and unbreakable spirit and strength. She must have studied the actual Queen Elizabeth pretty good to portray her on film. Bette Davis was doing some good stuff in the movies at this time, even if she had not yet risen to stardom. She had appeared in Jezebel at this time, after being rejected as Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With The Wind. Jezebel is another great performance as she potrays a strong and passionate Southern belle in the Civil War Era. But this film takes place in London during the last years of Queen Elizabeth's reign (1690's). Robert Devereux, Queen Elizabeth's love, is played by Errol Flynn. Errol Flynn, a notorious playboy and ladies's man at the time, reminded people of Douglas Fairbanks. Both actors specialized in playing handsome and heroic romantic leads, swashbucklers who wielded swords to fight the enemy and win the heart of a fair maiden. Errol Flynn as Roberto Devereux is the perfect choice. This film is well made, looks good and is very 30's. If you're a film buff for movies of the World War II Era or a Bette Davis fan, this movie is a real treat.
This drama is fictional. Historic reality was sacrificed to make for a sensational drama. This film was adapted from a play. There has also been an opera about this, written by Donizetti- Roberto Devereux. In reality, Queen Elizabeth never engaged in a romantic affair with the naval captain, Robert Devereux. Devereux, a war hero (he had defeated the Spanish Armada) was a favorite of Queen Elizabeth, but she never openly declared her love for him, nor did Devereux for her. In truth, Devereux was married. But legend has it that she loved Robert Devereux. He, on the other hand, plotted against her and attempted to remove her from the throne in a rebellion in London. He had seen her in a state of undress and one thing lead to another and he was executed. Queen Elizabeth died about a year after his execution, which she had hoped to prevent. It was possible she loved him as a friend or if she did love him, she could never hope for anything other than friendship, as she had with others, most notably with Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, who most scholars believe was the man she was truly in love with. Queen Elizabeth guarded her virginity to remain Englad's greatest queen. She knew that if she married and had children, she would lose her powers. ""No one has loved England more than I"" she would say and she has gone down in history as the greatest of England's rulers. During her reign, Shakespeare produced his plays.
This film is great to watch and I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in this historic period and who are fans of both Erroly Flynn and Bette Davis with those unforgettable eyes.",1076457600,3,3006,4.631086142322097

Filmed in early technicolor with great authenticity of sets and costumes and a fabulous supporting cast this is a rare treat and a memorable classic. Errol. Flynn more than holds his own opposite.

1208924,5,B00000F5N1,"Errol Flynn was quite possibly at his peek, as far as looks & physicality  during the filming of this movie, its ashamed there isn't more action fencing with blades that is.  There is plenty of fencing with word's between these star crossed lovers!  Much is made of Bette Davis's performance in this film and while her acting is terrific I feel they went a little overboard trying to exaggerate the age difference between the two star's!  She almost appears frightening, making the romance almost unbelievable!!!  I always thought this would have been better with Flora Robson playing Queen Elizabeth.  The chemistry in ""The Sea Hawk"" between Errol Flynn & Flora Robson worked incredibly well !!  I think Flora Robson definitely had the acting ability to pull this movie off!  And had she been cast opposite of Errol Flynn in this it would have been Flora's third appearance in motion pictures as Queen Elizabeth!!!  But no one can deny Bette Davis does' a great job in this film but for me she looks more creepy than older.  Errol Flynn is acting his butt off, but I think the public being so used to his physical feats of swashbuckling were constantly waiting for some flashy duel's and missed his fiery performance!!!  This is one of those film's that the more you watch it the more you pick up from it.  There is action galore just not the kind your used to seeing in a period piece with Errol Flynn.  While it says on the disc cover that this film is preserved in its theatrical ratio it fills the entire screen this can only mean that it is in anamorphic widescreen or it has been panned & scanned.  The costumes are beautifully opulent for this time period & accurate.  Even the armor is very artistically made with stunning inlays & pattern welding!  This has all the gorgeous vivid color one expects to see in a big budget epic from the 50's & 60's era of movie making as well as some great cinematography a incredible feat considering how much of this film takes place inside.  This is a must have for fan's of both Davis & Flynn as they both deliver great performances!!!  I am a huge fan of period piece's and this movie is visually stunning & with its star studded cast it has Oscar written all over it!!!  While this may not be a historically accurate story it is certainly historically accurate as far as weapons, armor & costume's, it is like peaking back through time!!!",1432684800,2,2387,4.574117647058824

1209013,3,B00000F5N1,"A couple of reviewers have commented on the fact that Davis was incredibly hammy in this picture.  Errol Flynn was pasted by the critics for his performance while Davis was celebrated.  This may have had more to do with the fact that 1939 was her best year in movies with four hit films to her credit.  It must have been this that influenced the critics.

In retrospect it is my opinion that Davis squirms and wiggles all over the place, incessantly twitching and tapping her fingers.  It is a performance that is practically laughable and almost too difficult to watch because her mannerisms are so distracting.  If ever she needed William Wyler as a director she needed him in this movie.  He would have had her tone it down.  Its ridiculous....all she does is wiggle...wiggle...wiggle.  Flynn got it right when he told her she looked like she defecated in her panties.

As for Flynn, also in retrospect, I think he gives an outstanding performance.  It is flawless.  He manages to hold his own against Davis' actressy portrayal and even Davis, in her later years told Robert Osborne, ""I've got to stop putting Flynn down.  Watching this film again after so many years I think he was just wonderful.  Just wonderful!""  Well said, Miss Davis.  And so true.

The story is riveting and the production values are excellent as is the supporting cast.  The DVD transfer is beautiful except for a short sequence toward the end in a Flynn close-up.  I don't know what happened there but the film is terribly out-of-focus marring Flynn's beauty. (Flynn was at the peak of his beauty here).

Unfortunately, as I have stated the one performance which throws everything off kilter is Davis'.  And it wasn't that she did research either as one reviewer commented that perhaps Elizabeth had some sort of palsy.  If that is the truth then most of her characters have palsy as this type of mannerism is present in nearly all of her films (except perhaps those directed by William Wyler).  In ""Dark Victory"" she does the same thing with her fingers.  Also in ""Now Voyager"", ""In THis Our Life"", ""The Old Maid"", ""Marked Woman"", ""All This and Heaven Too""....though not to the extent that she does here.  Yet they call this good acting.  Well, to each his own.

This is an entertaining film nonetheless but I don't give it more than 3 stars because of Davis.",1348963200,2,2339,4.697044334975369
1209014,2,B00000F5N1,"Maxwell Anderson never let established historical fact stand in the way of a good melodrama or an opportunity for the actors to chew lots of scenery. This film is a showcase for Bette Davis and Erroll Flynn and really has very little to do with Elizabeth I and the Earl of Essex. In the light of Hollywood's traditional contempt for actual history, I can't judge the film too harshly on those grounds. But it does gall me that they chose to whitewash a maniac (Essex) while making good men like Cecil etc. into conspiring villains.",1314835200,3,531,4.6
1209015,3,B00000F5N1,"For a subject as gritty and raw as that of Queen Elizabeth, this film sadly comes off as a stagy soap opera.  Thankfully, Bette Davis is there is hone in her skills as an actress and salvage what she can from the film, but the tone of the film accompanied by Errol Flynn's performance kind of tank it for me.

Looking at Flynn all I could see was Robin Hood.

Technically, the film is very dated, especially in the effects department, but those things are forgiven (even though this film came out the same year as the technical marvel `Gone with the Wind') due to its age, but some of the decisions made tend to make the film rather hokey, which is not something I expected from a dramatic film such as this.  Small details (like having Essex snap his own sword in two against his knee) drag down this films credibility.  I also found that the film verged on boring in certain scenes, especially the campy way in which the war with Ireland was handled.  In fact, Earl of Tyrone's speech about how ""if she had only given you the support you deserved"" made me roll my eyes.

It is dialog like that that ruins films like this, stripping them of any credibility.

The first half of this film, for me, was actually rather good.  I was engaged and intrigued, but once Essex returns from Ireland, the film takes a major nosedive into frothy soap opera antics, especially with the preposterous conversations between the Queen and Essex over `power' and `the throne'.  None of it seems even moderately realistic.  The film tries too hard to build a romantic chemistry (that isn't there) that these scenes wind up coming across uneven and disjointed.

Flynn's performance is rather disconnected in itself.  He doesn't really know how to carry the weight of this character, and placed next to Bette Davis, he is out of his league.  Davis chews up this character effortlessly.  She had a banner year in 1939, with this, `The Old Maid' and her Oscar vehicle `Dark Victory'.  Personally, this was her finest performance (I find `Dark Victory' to be uneven in all areas).  This is a very complex and layered roll, and when you factor in the films own uneven tone, Davis handled it nearly flawlessly.  She really understood how to attack every nook and cranny of Elizabeth's persona.  You believe that she is in love, but you never question her decisions, no matter how harsh.

I wish that this film had kept up the good work it was producing in the outset.  In the end, it verges on camp and becomes a missed opportunity.  I applaud Davis for `going there', delivering a performance worthy of her name.  I only wish that the rest of the film had rose to her level.",1276646400,4,2649,4.553911205073995
1209016,4,B00000F5N1,"""Elizabeth and Essex""(1939)  is really Bette and Errol. Bette Davis was Warners #1 female star and she wanted Laurence Olivier to play Essex. But she got Errol Flynn and complained ""He wasn't an experienced enough actor to cope with the complicated blank verse..."" Their off screen antagonism apparently can be seen on screen as well, and the scene in which she slaps Flynn has a bit too much muscle behind it - watch Flynn's face immediately after he gets hit. In his autobiography Flynn said ""Joe Lewis himself couldn't give a right hook better than Bette"".

Bette Davis is a film icon. She appeared in nearly 100 films, was nominated for an Oscar 11 times and won twice (""Dangerous"" in 1935 and ""Jezebel""  in 1939), nominated for an Emmy 4 times and won once (""Strangers"" in 1979), 3 Golden Globe Nominations, and for ""All About Eve"" (1950) she won awards at Cannes, in Italy,  and the New York Film Critics. According to AFI she is the #2 female screen legend. Flynn himself said ""She was the greatest thing in movies"".

1939 was a busy year for Bette. She appeared in 4 films that year - ""Dark Victory"", ""the Old Maid"", and ""Juarez"". Flynn too was busy. ""Dodge City"" appeared this same year, and he had 4 films in 1938 and would complete 3 more in 1940. But even busier was director Michael Curtiz who completed 5 films in 1938, 6 in 1939, and 3 in 1940.

Flynn got his break out role as ""Captain Blood"" (1935) because Robert Donat turned down the part following his success in ""The 39 Steps"" and his refusal to play a one dimensional swash buckler. Flynn had no such compunctions, and since the studio was all set to start filming, and Flynn was available for a mere $125 per week, the deed was done. The rest is history, and by 1939 Flynn was a top star with such films as ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" (1936) and ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938).

In fact, during Elizabeth nand Essex, Flynn made $6000 per week compared to Davis who only made $5000 per week, which was a continuing source of irritation to Davis.

Michael Curtiz directed. Curtiz and Flynn did a dozen films together including ""Captain Blood"" (1935), ""Charge of the Light Brigade"" (1936),""Robin Hood"" (1938), ""Dodge City"" (1939), ""Virginia City"" (1940), ""The Sea Hawk"" (1940), and ""Santa fe Trail"" (1940). While they had an extremely successful on screen collaboration, off screen they were bitter enemies, complicated by the fact that Flynn's first wife had earlier been married to Curtiz. In his autobiography Flynn lamented ""I was to spend 5 miserable years with him"" and called him a ""ruthless perfectionist.""

While Curtiz did a lot of work with Flynn,  and was nominated for their first collaboration ""Captain Blood"" (1935), Curtiz went on for 2 more nominations for films with Jimmy Cagney (""Angels with Dirty Faces"" in 1938 and ""Yankee Doddle Dandy"" in 1941) and one win for a film with Bogart (""Casablanca"" in 1942), one of eight they made together. Curtiz had a sense of humor about himself - he once declared ""The next time I want an idiot to do this, I'll do it myself."" But he could be hell to work with, and Bette Davis refused to work with him following  this film after he called her a ""no good sexless son of a bitch.""

The film features Olivia de Haviland, Donald Crisp, Alan Hale, and Vincent Price.

Although Olivia de Haviland made 9 films with Errol Flynn between 1938 and 1943, it's her work without Flynn for which she received the most accolades. We remember her best in ""GWTW"" (1939) for which she was nominated for an Oscar. She was nominated again in 1941 for ""Hold Back the Dream"" and won for ""To Each Her Own"" (1947) and ""The Heiress"" (1949). She won Best Actress by the National Board of Review, the New York Film Criticis, and the Venice Film festival for her role as a mental patient in ""The Snake Pit"" (1949).

Flynn confessed to falling in love with her and in his autobiography called her ""a young woman of extraordinary charm.""

Donald Crisp plays Sir Francis Bacon. He appeared in more than 150 films from 1908 through 1963. He won Best Supporting Actor for ""How Green was My Valley"" (1941) and gave memorable performances in films such as ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1935), ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" (1936), ""Jezebel"" (1938), ""National Velvet"" (1944), and ""The Long Gray Line"" (1955).

Alan Hale Sr. was a frequent sidekick to Flynn in films such as ""Robin Hood"" (1938), ""Dodge City"" (1939), ""Virginia City"" (1940), ""The Sea Hawk"" (1940), ""Santa fe Trail"" (1940), and ""Gentleman Jim"" (1942). He has the distinction of appearing as Little John in the 1922 version with Douglas Fairbanks, again in 1938 with Flynn, and finally in 1950 in ""Rogues of Sherwood Forest"" with John Derek. In this film Hale plays an opponent of Flynn, the first and only time they battled each other.

Flynn and Hale were close friends. Privately he called him ""Sarge"" and Hale referred to Flynn as ""The Baron"" Flynn said Hale was ""the most feared character actor in Hollywood.""

Vincent Price plays Sir Walter Raleigh. We tend to think of Price for all the B horror movies he made in the 50s and 60s, especially the first 3D film ""House of Wax"" (1953) and the marvelous ""The Fly"" (1958). But Price was extremely versatile, and did comedies (e.g., ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein"" in 1948, ""Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine"" in 1965, Egghead on the TV series ""Batman""), period pieces (e.g., ""The Ten Commandments"" in 1956, ""The Three Musketeers"" in 1948 and again in 1960), and film noir  (""Laura"" in 1944, ""The Long Night"" in 1947, ""His Kind of Woman"" in 1951).

Bette Davis would play Elizabeth I again nearly 20 years later in ""The Virgin Queen"" (1955). Other portrayals of the great queen include Cate Blanchett in 1998 (""Elizabeth"") and again in 2007 (""Elizabeth"" The Golden Age""), Helen Mirren in 2005 (""Elizabeth I"" on HBO), Glenda Jackson in 1971 (""Elizabeth R""), Judith Anderson in 1968 (""Elizabeth I"" for Hallmark Hall of Fame), and Jean Simmons in 1953 (""Young Bess""). My personal preferences are Glenda Jackson and Judith Anderson.

E&E was a big success as befits the pairing of two of the biggest stars, but Flynn got poor reviews. The film received 5 Oscar nominations (Best Sound, Music, Special Effects, Color, and Art Direction) but no wins.

Davis is terrific and commands every scene. Flynn is weak, especially when compared to his other performances, but it was hard for a male co-star to shine with Davis on the set. Olivia de Haviland is off on the periphery, and the chemistry that she and Flynn demonstrated elsewhere is not here. The story is reasonably accurate and the costumes and sets are marvelous.

There are  a host of Tudor/Elizabethian period films that emerged around this time - ""The Sea Hawk"" (1940) with Errol Flynn, ""The Prince and the Pauper"" (1937) with Errol Flynn, ""The Private Life of Henry VIII"" (1933) with Charles Laughton - and few of them stand up today. ""Elizabeth and Essex"" is probably the best of the lot.",1274572800,3,6971,4.709120788824979
1209017,5,B00000F5N1,"When I was a little girl I saw this movie many times when it was shown on TV. Recently I have been enjoying all of Bette Davis movies one by one.  Modern movies and TV do not hold my interest so I decided to go back in time and review all of her movies.  This one is one of my favorites.

There cannot be any question about the quality and effectiveness of Bette Davis as an actress.  She is so believable in what ever costume or attitude you view her.  In my opinion she deserves the title of the best actress that Hollywood has ever produced for all time.  The movie is based on fact and I like history and autobiography. History is more interesting than make believe even with the wonderful embelleshments of costume and elaborate sets that only the Golden Age of Hollywood produced.

The costumes of this movie are so incredible, they alone inspire creativity and wonder.  Created by the wonderful Ory Kelly, who dressed Bette Davis in a some of her best films, they captured my attention as a child and they have not lost their power to mesmerize.  Some artistry is dead in Hollywood now and great costume design is one art that is gone forever.  If you want to see a good movie with a great story, acted by the best actress of all time and dressed by the best costume designer, this movie is for you.",1266364800,5,1306,4.337448559670782
1209018,5,B00000F5N1,"The acting in this film, especially by Bette Davis playing the again Queen Elizabeth, is first rate.  She has the bearing, the mannerisms, the demeanor of a queen growing old -- a performance that is almost chilling at times!

Also Davis' costar in ""The Virgin Queen"", Richard Todd, is more appropriate because his level of skill as an actor surpasses that of Errol Flynn in this disaster. Whereas Flynn portrays the Earl of Essex, Todd portrays Sir Walter Raleigh. Not being very much aware of British history, I presume these are different characters with whom Elizabeth was involved at different times in her love life. In any case, Davis' dialogue in ""Virgin"" is so sharp and witty that it approaches Shakespeare and Davis' spot on delivery of her lines will have you marveling at her and clinging to every word.",1204416000,3,1037,5.740259740259741
1209051,5,B00000F5N1,"By 1939, director Michael Curtiz had collaborated with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland three times over the past three years. In THE PRIVATE LIVES OF ELIZABETH AND ESSEX, Curtiz paired Flynn and de Havilland with most of the top stars at Warners to create a period piece that celebrates a tumultuous decade in English history, a time when Queen Elizabeth (Bette Davis) was trying mightily to hold her throne against a variety of external threats (Spain, France, Ireland) and some internal threats, not the least of whom was Robert Deveraux, Lord Essex (Flynn), whose personal tragedy was that he coveted Elizabeth's throne more than he loved her for herself. Historically, it is not at all clear whether their love affair was anything near the torrid level generated by Flynn and Davis, but their constant wrangling over whether their love trumps power or the reverse provides the film's basic dramatic thrust.

Queen Elizabeth was historically much older than Essex, and Miss Davis creditably admits this several times though Hollywood makeup does not depict the redhaired rouged queen as a wrinkled ruler merely playing with her favorite toyboy.  The charm of much of this film lies in the interaction among the entire cast.  Present is Alan Hale, Leo G Carrol, Vincent Price, Henry Stephenson, Donald Crisp, and Nanette Fabray.  With the execption of Crisp and de Havilland, all the central players are warped to varying degrees in their lust for power.  Surprising enough not even Flynn himself is immune.  This film is one of his very few examples in which his character is flawed.

The audience traces the contentious relationship between Elizabeth and Essex from start to finish in a manner that does not drag in the least.  Indeed, though we can see the need for Essex to place himself as First Among Equals, we can also note his genuine affection for her.  Given his earlier screen romances with de Havilland, it is startling to see him brush off her clumsy attempts at lovemaking.  THE PRIVATE LIVES OF ELIZABETH AND ESSEX is a movie that peels away the layers of affection and love to reveal the often gritty and realpolitik coldness that characterizes the monarchy of 16th century England.  The film's eye catching costumes and court schemes emphasize rather than detract from this very fundamental aspect of life at the very highest levels of royal society.",1200700800,,2374,4.984810126582278
1209052,5,B00000F5N1,"The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex may have been the set from hell - Bette Davis despised Errol Flynn, who hated director Michael Curtiz while Olivia De Havilland was given a thankless supporting role as Jack Warner's way of keeping her in her place after the success of Gone With the Wind -  but it turned out rather splendidly. Offering Hollywood rather than history, and with all the glories that only the studio system at its peak could offer, it's grand entertainment. Glorious Technicolor cinematography from Sol Polito, lavish production design from Anton Grot that would be reused in Flynn's version of The Sea Hawk and Erich Wolfgang Korngold's triumphant score are all just the icing on the cake.

With just a few bleak depictions of Essex's disastrous Irish campaign, there's not much in the way of swashbuckling: the emphasis here is on doomed romance between two people drawn to each other by the very things that keep them apart. Flynn's charismatic but egotistical and fatally overambitious Essex, whose popularity is never matched by the reality of his (under)achievements, is one of many thwarted suitors who attempted to wear the crown by wooing the woman while she was equally determined not to be ruled by weaker men. It's her power that appeals to him and his carefree short-sighted irresponsibility that attracts her, but though Davis' bitter Elizabeth may try to grab a few moments of happiness with him, she's all too aware that for her to surrender to a husband would be to abdicate all power and doom England to disastrous rule. The tragedy comes from the fact that he's all too aware of his own weaknesses, but too proud to conquer them or even to save himself when offered the chance - something of a change from the usual Errol Flynn hero. But then this is not exactly a typical Flynn film: for all his charm and bravado, Elizabeth is the real focus of the film. And while many of the Flynn film regulars are present and correct, most are playing very different roles. De Havilland is less-than-sympathetic for once as the lady-in-waiting taunting the queen over her lost youth, Alan Hale appears as Flynn's enemy rather than his sidekick for a change, while even Donald Crisp's usual onscreen integrity is discreetly tucked away lest it interfere with his own ambitions at court when the wind starts to change. Only Henry Daniell, in a virtual dress rehearsal for his role in The Sea Hawk, plays true to form as one of the plotters alongside Vincent Price's Walter Raleigh.

As history it's bunk, but as a doomed romance, complete with a memorably tragic final encounter, it's absolutely engrossing. Good extras on the DVD too, though it's a shame they could only find a black and white trailer for such a magnificent Technicolor film.",1197763200,24,2771,4.841772151898734
1209053,5,B00000F5N1,"As before, There is no one like Bette Davis, and this movie proves it. No other women in Hollywood at the time of the making of this picture would have gone out on  the limb that Miss Davis did - That is why this picture is so good. Errol Flynn, always a feast to look at, is extremely up to the task of going toe to toe with Bette Davis as Queen Elizabeth I, Mr. Flynn, possibly was better than even he thought he could be - and this movie proves it -",1188777600,8,452,3.860215053763441
1209054,4,B00000F5N1,"This historical epic is definitely Hollywood-ized, but Hollywood-ized in the best sense: there are lavish sets, rich technicolor costumes, big dramatic situations, and biting dialogue.  And it's definitely intelligent Hollywood-ization, too, as I'm betting there's enough truth here about the real-life situation between Elizabeth I and Lord Essex to give one at least a rudimentary grounding in that situation.  And a painless grounding it is: just sit back and enjoy the verbal jousting and inflamed passions between Bette Davis and Errol Flynn.  History was never so entertaining.

An overall wonderful print (only occasionally marred by a blurry, misaligned technicolor shot) is accompanied by some interesting special features.  The oddest one is a short subject about a little kid who runs a kingdom about to be overthrown, until a Wild West show comes to town to save the day.  There's also a rare serious-in-tone Warner Brothers cartoon from 1938 or so, depicting Porky Pig learning to appreciate our nation's history and what the words behind the ""Pledge of Allegiance"" mean.  Interestingly, the words ""under God"" don't appear in Porky's (or Warner Brothers') version of the circa-1938 pledge.  So, the belief in a separation between church and state DIDN'T start with modern-day ""lefties""?

1209055,4,B00000F5N1,"THE PRIVATE LIVES OF ELIZABETH AND ESSEX (1939) features a stunner of a performance from Bette Davis, brilliant Technicolor photography and a sweeping score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold.  What more could a classic movie fan want?

Based upon ""Elizabeth the Queen"" by Maxwell Anderson, THE PRIVATE LIVES OF ELIZABETH AND ESSEX recounts, with some liberties, the stormy relationship of Queen Elizabeth 1st (Bette Davis) and the Earl of Essex, Robert Devereux (Errol Flynn).  Robert wants desperately to rule England, something Elizabeth would never sacrifice...not even for love.

The pain and the passion of this story is simply breathtaking.  Despite the fact that Davis hated working with Errol Flynn (they were paired in ""The Sisters"" the previous year); their onscreen chemistry fairly crackles.  Davis shaved off her eyebrows plus two inches from her hairline in order to resemble the aged Queen Elizabeth.  It's one of her most subtle and affecting performances.

Olivia de Havilland (the frequent love interest in Errol Flynn's swashbucklers), is relegated to supporting status here, but still manages to command attention with her finely-drawn performance as Lady Penelope Gray.  There's also an early appearance from Broadway star Nanette Fabray---billed as Nanette Fabares--as a lovesick handmaiden.

THE PRIVATE LIVES OF ELIZABETH AND ESSEX features a sweeping and majestic score from Wolfgang Erich Korngold,  with memorable motifs for the two main characters.  The Technicolor photography is warm and lush, especially during the palace scenes; the lighting is superb.

In another twist, most of the sets and costumes later found their way into Errol Flynn's next big vehicle,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sea-Hawk/dp/B00005JMR6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sea Hawk</a>&nbsp;(1940). Bette Davis would go on to reprise her role as Queen Elizabeth 1st in ""The Virgin Queen"" (1956).

The new DVD from Warner Brothers include several worthwhile bonuses.  There's a new Making-Of featurette (""Battle Royale"") which delves into the history of the production.  The 'Warner Night at the Movies' feature gives you the option to screen the film with newsreel, Merry Melodies cartoon (""Old Glory""), and musical short (""The Royal Rodeo"").

Davis is forced to stretch more in her part, and bravely foregoes any vanity in playing the spinster queen, while Flynn's Essex fits the actor's breezy, effortless charisma like a glove.

1209057,4,B00000F5N1,"""The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex"" was the final of four great film released in 1939 for Bette Davis. From the modern dress tragedienne in ""Dark Victory"" to the pinched austere ""Old Maid"" and the hysterical Carlotta in ""Juarez"", Davis could do no wrong. The ultimate sign of prestige was to play royalty and so she took on Elizabeth the first.

The film was based on a verbose Maxwell Anderson play. It opens the play up with an unconvincing section on the warfields of Ireland but the bulk of the film is set in Elizabeth's court which Davis dominates impressively. Davis had hoped to have Laurence Olivier with her but Warner Brothers had Errol Flynn under contract and he was big box office and so got the role of the Earl of Essex. Against Davis's glamour skimping, overwrought queen, he looks great but sounds wrong. Essex may have been an opportunist which Flynn easily suggests but his delivery of the lines is often woeful and one can't help feeling that Davis tries to compensate for his inadequacies. Her Queen may seem mannered but she claws at the air with her left hand and brilliantly conveys the problems of being a monarch first and woman second. Surely her performance became the blueprint for others like Glenda Jackson who later played the role. Even if you do not like Davis, she does convey the authority of a monarch. Every other aspect of the film is on a grand scale - the technicolour photography, spectacular sets, a Korngold score which has an epic quality and, above all, the costumes. Davis held out for the correct costumes and they are magnificent. The supporting cast is excellent too, including the beautiful Olivia de Havilland, who plays with Davis very well. Donald Crisp, in particular, is very good.

The DVD print is excellent and there is a worthwhile short documentary on the film with Nannette Fabray appearing. She played a lady in waiting in the film and has a good scene with Davis which she recalls vividly. There is a cartoon and newsreel which are OK but the technicolour short film, which mixes English royalty in the vein of the film with singing cowboys and rodeos is pretty hard to stomach. A young and handsome John Payne stars.

The DVD is very good value if purchased as part of the Errol Flynn Signature Collection, an odd inclusion really because Davis's art exposes Flynn's immaturity.",1171756800,6,2351,4.743276283618582

The Movie

Bette Davis, Errol Flynn, Vincent Price, and Olivia De Havillan these names alone make you simply wish to see this movie. It is a powerful movie showing a deep chemistry between Davis and Flynn. IT shows the love between Elizabeth and Essex. It shows the struggle between politics and human nature. It asks the question should a Queen share her throne with a man who may or may not be in it for power. Is love really the cure all. It is a movie that pulls you in, with such great actors that u must watch

The Video:

 This movie was made in 1939 it does undoubtedly show its age. It has some light flicker on the picture. It is of course full screen since at that time that was the shape of the theaters screens. It is very watchable it has the standard color and look of the 1930's films. It has a very Wizard of Oz look and feel to it as do most of the 1930's films.

 No 5.1 here just 2.1 but you don't notice it anyhow it's not a movie made to make the walls shake.

1209091,4,B00000F5N1,"THE PRIVATE LIFES OF ELIZABETH AND ESSEX is a lavish, colorful, lop-sided costumer directed by Academy Award winning director Michael Curtiz (won it for Casablanca, by the way) and starring the two heavyweights of the Warner Brothers lot in 1939 - Bette Davis and Errol Flynn.  Adapted from playwright Maxwell Anderson's `Elizabeth the Queen,' it's the story of the tempestuous love affair between the Virgin Queen and the Earl of Essex.

 Fans of Bette Davis and/or Errol Flynn (I like both of them) will get a kick out of this one.  Davis is uglied up quite a bit to play Elizabeth - her eyebrows and a couple of inches of forehead hair have been shaved off, a coat of white kabuki makeup covers her face, and every line, pouch, and bag on her face is caught on camera.  For an industry that depends so much on physical beauty Davis's transformation is breathtakingly audacious.

 This should be about Elizabeth I, with Essex hidden in a conniving corner somewhere.  But when you've got the studio's leading male star sharing over-the-title credits with Davis, I guess, you make compromises, and TPloE&E is riff with them, starting with the title.  The short feature `Elizabeth and Essex: Battle Royale' presents some of the juicier highlights of the backstage bad blood.  When Flynn was cast (Davis wanted Laurence Olivier to play Essex) he wanted to change the title to `The Knight and the Lady.'  While the movie doesn't ignore Essex/Flynn's ambitious or popular appeal, I think it fudges some with his love for the older, unattractive, Elizabeth.  And, because it's Flynn, Essex's noble nature survives intact.  Heck, for all I know that's historically accurate, but it deflects attention and a degree of tragedy from Davis's Elizabeth.

 As usual Warners has included the welcome `Warner Night at the Movies' on the dvd.  I got the biggest kick out of `The Royal Rodeo,' a 15-minute short from 1939 starring John Payne and Cliff Edwards.  This is one of Payne's first screen appearances, he's probably best remembered as Maureen O'Hara's boyfriend in ""Miracle on 34th Street,"" while Cliff Edwards was the voice of Walt Disney's Jiminy Cricket.  `The Royal Rodeo' is silly fluff about a ten-year-old monarch, bored with kinging and the object of a secret, nefarious plot.  Payne plays a singing cowboy, Edwards his singing sidekick.  Songs are sung, plots are foiled and the cowboys are triumphant in glorious Technicolor.",1146355200,7,2428,4.992537313432836

Errol Flynn is just as he should be: vigorous, virulent, gorgeous and at the top of his acting form. Poor Olivia DeHavilland gets short shrift as a romantic interest for Essex, but that is all explained away in the very excellent extra features included with the DVD.

Bette Davis and Errol Flynn made The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex fascinatingly public, striking sparks in this lavish Techincolor tale of the ill-fated love between the aging Elizabeth I and the dashing Earl of Essex. Thoroughly unglamorous here - eyes and hairline shaved, pace fainted chalky white - double Academy Award winner* Davis exudes such intelligence, energy and ardor that her romance with the decades-younger Essex (Flynn at the peak of his remarkable good looks and athletic verve) is completely believable.

1209094,5,B00000F5N1,"One thing this movie makes perfectly clear is that Flynn was a natural, whereas Elizabeth Davis was only an actress. By this I mean that Flynn convinces, but Bette doesn't --- all the time you KNOW she is acting, whereas Flynn IS the character; although she gets better as the story unfolds. It's rather a laboured script, but it has its moments, once you get into the reality of what it meant for this insecure lady, with her appalling childhood and her doubts and uncertainties, to cling on to the throne and finally come through to become one of England's most revered monarchs. Yes, it's stagy, but it's better and more fascinating than I thought it would be. Flynn shows again that he was a great actor, subtle and nuanced in his performance.

The colour is very poor, unfortunately. The special features include a couple of highly cringe-making shorts: a bunch of singing cowboys in Ruritania, showing those old pesky Europeans what a wunnerful land of the free America is (just so long as the Native Americans know their places), coupled with an even more in-your-face piece of cartoon propaganda. Still, I suppose it was all part of the build-up to American intervention in WWII, although it looks decidedly odd today. Somehow I can't help feeling that those early American ideals got badly lost along the way.",1129248000,6,1318,4.8061674008810575
1209095,5,B00000F5N1,"It's my understanding that this film takes liberties with history concerning the nature of Elizabeth and Essex' relationship but since I wasn't attuned to that specific history I'll accept this film as first class entertainment and if I so desire explore the truth later.  It's also my understanding that there was disdain between the film's stars, Bette Davis and Errol Flynn.  It's not noticable on the screen or rather this animous must have fueled their creative juices because they are both first-rate.  Davis for a 30 year old woman is stupendous as Elizabeth, a woman in the autumn of her years who must make the heartbreaking choice between her desires and the demands that her status in life brought her.  Flynn, breaking from his swashbuckler roles, seized the dramatic demands of Essex, an impulsive man torn between his love for the Queen and his own ambitions.  The beauty of this film is that it's themes are timeless and it's a tale well told.  A bonus here is the gorgeous Technicolor that accentuates the sumptuous costumes and art direction.  Thank you Warner Brothers for including this in the Errol Flynn box set or otherwise I never would have discovered it.",1123804800,4,1179,4.894472361809045
1209096,3,B00000F5N1,"Flynn scores with a relaxed, cheeky performance that nicely counterpoints Davis's nervous, hand-wringing histrionics. According to the underfed documentary included on this DVD, the two stars couldn't stand being in the same room with each other. However, the tension serves their characterisations superbly. The moment when Essex slams Elizabeth's backside in pure good fellowship after one of their many heated arguments is priceless. The two performances are the main reason why this film is worth seeing. Davis convincingly conveys the conflict between Elizabeth's emotional needs and her public duty, while Flynn's portrait of a cavalier, shallow, ambitious soldier who, nevertheless, has genuine feeling for this difficult and complex woman is not without subtlety (although one feels it's hardly a stretch, either). The other performance of note is Donald Crisp's ambivelent Francis Bacon: at once Essex's friend, but one who is astute enough to bend with the political wind to save his own neck. The atmosphere within the castle walls is well-developed by Michael Curtiz, who puts his trademark use of shadows to good effect; but the script obviously frustrates him. The film cries out for some epic sword-play. The best we get is swords occasionally drawn in anger, and a few minutes of action on Essex's ill-fated Irish venture. Essentially, this is a drawing-room drama flawed by unconvincing character motivations, notably Essex's ""I love you, but as I live and breathe I'll always try to steal your crown. I don't know why. It's just the way I am, so you'd better execute me."" [I paraphrase] Flynn and Davis make it palatable, though.

The DVD follows the pattern of recent Warner releases. Leonard Maltin presents the DVD extras from 1939: a moderately amusing musical short, THE ROYAL RODEO, with John Payne as a singing cowboy foiling a coup in a small European Kingdom (a metaphoric precursor of things to come, I suppose); a beautifully animated patriotic cartoon, OLD GLORY, which has Uncle Sam explaining to Porky Pig what the Pledge of Allegiance means; a Newsreel and a trailer for Dark Victory. The DVD transfer of an excellent Technicolor print seems fine to me, but I note the concerns of other reviewers.",1121212800,8,2230,5.194444444444445

A solid supporting cast includes Donald Crisp, Leo J. Carroll, Alan Hale, Vincent Price and a very young Nanette Fabray (here ""Fabares,"" her real family name), but sadly Olivia de Haviland, who played so well against Flynn in so many films including the prior year's ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, is underused.  Colorful, and the on-screen chemistry between Davis and Flynn is undeniable (although they really detested each other, we're told), but I've no wish to see this one again anytime soon.",1509148800,,669,5.128440366972477

7907897,5,B00000F5N1,"THE PRIVATE LIVES OF ELIZABETH AND ESSEX is a magnificent film from the glory days of Hollywood when the story and the spectacular mattered. Special effects were simple and the cast and story ruled the day. There is a lot to praise about PRIVATE LIVES featuring some of the biggest stars and character actors of 1939. If you are a fan of Bette Davis or Errol Flynn or classic movies in general, you can't miss this outstanding trip to old Hollywood.

Davis was born to play Queen Elizabeth I of England. In fact, she played Elizabeth again in 1955. Here is youthful Errol Flynn at his sexiest. Although Davis is close to Flynn's age she portrays an older Elizabeth obsessed with losing her youth and looks and ability to bewitch male admirers. Look for a young Vincent Price as Sir Walter Raleigh along with young Olivia de Havilland and Nanette Fabray. As I write these words, de Havilland and Fabray are the last living stars from this 1939 film.

I've read a lot about Elizabeth I and I know Hollywood has always tinkered with the facts. PRIVATES LIVES follows history to a broad extent. Elizabeth and the Earl of Essex (Flynn) did seem to have some sort of attraction fueled by each one's wild ambition. Elizabeth and Essex clash on all levels. Did he love her as she loved him? Only history knows.

Here is all the glory and splendor of a 1939 Hollywood extravaganza. Obviously, it was mostly filmed in sound stages with some local California filling in (not very realistically) for England. Acting is top notch and Flynn and Davis have a wild chemistry despite their alleged mutual distaste for each other. As another reviewer wrote, ""they don't make them like this anymore."" PRIVATE LIVES is a delightful spectacle to watch and enjoy. The acting is beyond compare and the lush and gorgeous period costumes are enchanting. It's a step back into time when the story and the actors ruled the celluloid world.",1492473600,2,1912,4.701492537313433
