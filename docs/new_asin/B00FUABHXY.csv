8618618,4,B00FUABHXY,"This doesn't start off too promisingly.  Killjoy opens with a murder, then there's a love triangle between two doctors and a flighty but rich young woman played by a hasn't quite figured out the acting thing yet Kim Basinger.  Initially, this looks like one of those soapy thrillers that the Lifetime Channel used to churn out with numbing regularity.  Then the plot twists start to kick in.

Dr. Paul Trenton (John Rubinstein) is the spurned suitor and sets up his playboy rival who gets engaged to apparent object of desire Laury Medford (Kim Basinger) by making it appear to Laury that a woman named Joy Morgan is still sleeping with the now engaged Dr. Max Heller (Steven Macht).  Trenton insists to his domineering mother (Nancy Marchand) that Joy Morgan never existed and that he made her up--but a mysterious stranger played by Robert Culp turns up looking for Joy Morgan and seems to think that she is indeed very real.  And the supposedly non-existent Joy Morgan turns up in the flesh at a party given by the Trenton's--or does she?

Before long this starts to strongly resemble the TV mystery movies that Columbo creators Richard Levinson and William Link used to write occasionally in the 1970's like One of My Wives Is Missing; Rehearsal For Murder or Guilty Conscience.  The twists pile on top of each other so deep that by the time the movie is nearly over all of the main characters is a murder suspect and you still don't know for certain what's actually going on.  It's all pretty silly but also quite fun if you enjoy mysteries that keep you guessing right up until the last possible moment.

Killjoy has a lame video cover that doesn't begin to do it justice but it's a fun little mystery that's more than worth an hour and a half of your time.",1497830400,,1763,4.621794871794871
