2076678,4,B0002CX17A,"Tae Bo: Strength/ Power is more of a water-downed version of the original, but I'm not saying that it is a bad workout. Here you get two workouts for a low price. The routines can be a little slow in Strength, but the pace picks up in Power. If you are already in great shape, then this DVD isn't for you. The DVD is more for beginners, or just someone who wants to throw in a new workout during the week.",1338940800,4,405,4.012345679012346
2076679,4,B0002CX17A,"This video was my second Tai Bo experience. It is designed to be slower and more flowing than some others (more in the yoga and palates worlds than boxing). We break a good sweat doing it and have enjoyed it so far.

NOTE: There is a set of ball-weights that does not come with the video that is recommended. We have done the vide several times without the weights and have still ""felt the burn"", but they will be a welcomed addition soon.",1258070400,,439,4.289156626506024
2076680,3,B0002CX17A,"I'm a big fan of Tae Bo and found this workout not as hard as the bootcamp series or the original Tae Bo Advanced workouts.  However, if you want an easier workout or are new to Tae Bo, I'd recommend this.  You can use small, weighted balls with the workouts, which increases toning.",1172880000,4,283,4.320754716981132
2076681,5,B0002CX17A,"I think that this is a great workout. I was using the older videos and needed to take it to the next level so I decided to buy this one and the the Foundation/Energy video. If you have even the least bit of coordination and balance you should be able to complete this workout. He goes through the moves slowly at first then you add the energy. I actually haven't bought the flexible balls that he uses I just make a fist and pretend that I have the balls and it works fine. I do plan to buy them though. So overall this video is very effective, a great sweat producer and believe me you will be feeling the effects the next day. Especially when you first start.",1118793600,7,661,4.171875
2076682,3,B0002CX17A,"I rented this DVD to try it out before I bought it, and I'm glad I did.  I first tried Tae Bo about 3 years ago.  I really liked the Basic and Advanced workouts, they got my heart rate up to where I knew I was really working out, and my muscles hurt for days afterword.  When I tried this DVD, the pace was quite a bit slower, my heart rate didn't remain elevated like I would have wished, and quite frankly I felt bored.  Not to mention the Tae Bo tools (which are 2 small 1/2 lb. flexible balls) which of coarse I don't own, or have any intention of buying.  If you're looking for a good cardio Tae Bo video, stick with the original, you'll use just as much STRENGTH/POWER, and get a better cardio workout to boot.",1105488000,14,716,4.085714285714285

2076695,1,B0002CX17A,Not a fan. Tried to get into this but I can't. Not a long enough warm up and there is not cool down stretching.,1414627200,,111,3.6666666666666665

2076697,3,B0002CX17A,"I like the idea of 10 minute workouts for our busy lives, but I don't understand why there is no menu so that the exerciser can select what workout he/she wants to do.",1392422400,,167,4.090909090909091

2076700,5,B0002CX17A,I am a very busy Mom and teacher. My husband is also very busy Dad and a teacher. There are times that we need to work out on the fly. We are workout partners and have been doing Tae Bo for years. I would say we have about 10 DVD's of Billy. This DVD lets you customize your workout and gives you a lot of choices that give good results in a short 10min. time period. You can pick as many 10min. workouts as you want and make your workout fit your time schedule! Great idea! Just what we needed!...and they aren't easy if you give it your all.,1390003200,4,543,3.9908256880733943
2076701,5,B0002CX17A,This is a great video if you want to get fit. I couldn't even make it all the way through this video. Of course I haven't exercised for 20 years. Billy really knows his stuff. I now have his complete library and love each time I exercise. I would recommend this tape and all of Billy Balnks workouts.,1359763200,,300,4.189655172413793
2076702,5,B0002CX17A,"Have always been a Tae Bo fan for years and I had purchased this...yet again...because I had the nerve to toss the original ones I bought.  My husby somehow convinced me as we were moving...that I had too many workout DVDs.  So of course I missed these and had to buy another one but this one is even better because there's 2 workouts in 1 dvd as opposed to the originals I had, it was 1 dvd for each workout.  Also, I love this series because it's slower paced so it helps me by preventing my asthma getting outta whack.  Not for advanced folks.",1359504000,,546,4.221153846153846
8026218,5,B0002CX17A,This is great if you don't have much time. In 10 minutes you are sore and you felt like you worked out. (The workouts are only 10 minutes long and there are 12 different ones for different target areas.),1501977600,,203,4.230769230769231
8026219,5,B0002CX17A,I love Billy Blanks' workouts. They are always lots of cardio. My teenagers will do them with me also. It's hard not to laugh at us all punching towards the tv. The moves aren't complicated. You can do just 10 minutes or keep adding the next 10 minute sections on and so forth. I found this helpful as I have breathing issues and conked out after the first 10 and yet my kids could keep gooding. It's a great toning and cardio workout at the same time. If you feel like it's not much of a work out like my son did after ten minutes then just wait. It won't be long before you are huffing and puffing by the next one. ;),1498953600,,619,4.040650406504065
8026220,5,B0002CX17A,Love all his DVDs.. if you want results all you have to do is stop being lazy and work it out I have great results ....been doing his DVDs for years,1483747200,,148,3.806451612903226
8026221,4,B0002CX17A,This was a wonderful workout and not too difficult. My ten years old likes to do it with me sometimes. The seller got it to me faster than expected and it was in great condition.,1480032000,,178,4.114285714285714
8026222,5,B0002CX17A,"One of Billy Banks' better DVDs. While all are good, the ones focusing on strength and / or power development are for me the better ones.",1477180800,,137,4.3076923076923075
8026223,2,B0002CX17A,Buying this as a download doesn't seem to give me any ability to just go to one of the 8 workouts.  It should at least give you timestamps for each one.,1471824000,4,152,3.903225806451613
8026224,5,B0002CX17A,"I have always gotten great results from Billy Blank's work outs. The 10-minute workouts give me a quick alternative to my busy life. Sometimes I will do 1, 2 or even 3 in a row or spread out as my schedule permits.",1468627200,4,214,4.119047619047619

8026227,5,B0002CX17A,I used to to these videos with my mom as a child. I remembered how fun they were and decided to retry as an adult. This movie is definitely a good workout and made me sore. I love doing these 10 minute videos in the morning after my husband leaves for work. Lots of fun for being exercise!,1451347200,4,289,4.0
