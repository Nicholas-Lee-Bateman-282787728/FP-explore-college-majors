There was some humor along the way making it a little on the light hearted vein of criminal drama.

""Wildcat"" describes the central character, an oil prospector who, to this point, has yet to bring in a well. Johnny Maverick (Arlen) and his new sidekick, Harold Nevins (Elisha Cook, Jr.), a kid from Massachusetts that Johnny calls ""Chicopee,"" stumble upon a remotely located pool of water that tastes like gasoline, a sure sign that somewhere underground there's oil.

The two raise enough cash to buy half-ownership of that piece of land, but another wildcatter named Mike Rawlins (Buster Crabbe) knows what they're up to, so he plans to sink his own well nearby and beat Johnny to the prize. Rawlins is your typical movie bad guy; his underhanded tricks cause Johnny all sorts of trouble. Another problem is a couple of con artists (Arline Judge and Bill Frawley) who hope to get rich quick by slyly attaching themselves to Johnny.

Finally, our hero only has 30 days to make his well pay off. After that it becomes the property of a rig parts dealer who has a lien on Johnny's dream. With all of these obstacles to overcome, can Johnny Maverick find happiness, true love and a million barrels of crude? We'll never tell!

7935504,2,B00005ALR8,"""Wildcat"" is a 1942 black and white B-movie action flick about oil exploration. It stars Richard Arlen as Johnny Maverick and Buster Crabbe as Mike Rawlins. The movie is standard fodder for the era, and the acting is decent for the most part. Parts of the film are slow, and parts of the script are laughable. There are subplots galore and lots of betrayal, fistfights, yelling, and general machismo surrounding the shenanigans that lead to no end of trouble, including the premature death of Chicopee Nevins (Elisha Cook, Jr.) in the most preposterous industrial accident in recent memory. I realize that special effects were in their infancy in 1942, but the ""accident"" scene is difficult to take seriously, particularly given how the chain of events began. Speaking of characters, this is a film that emphasizes the legitimacy of the oil men's names by giving them monikers like ""Watch Fob"" and ""Grits,"" so hold on to your hatband!

The action is intermittently plodding, and the story isn't particularly compelling, but there are certainly worse and more boring B-movies from the era. There is ample comic relief and peculiar character traits throughout the film, and the confidence scheme subplot is well executed. Also featured are weird asides about things like the world's most inelastic apple pie and mixing pancakes in a cement mixer, adding odd charm at unpredictable moments.

""Wildcat"" is a decent example of wartime B-movies. It's fairly run of the mill and certainly inoffensive, making for a pleasant but not especially memorable diversion. A running time of 120 minutes is claimed, but in reality it is closer to 68, which is perfectly adequate.",1340236800,,1662,5.084249084249084

The film begins on a highway where a man thumbs a ride. He wants to go where oil was discovered in hope of a better life. Johnny Maverick meets his old friends in a restaurant. Johnny collects for a charity from the customers! Johnny and Chicopee test the waters. Apple pie? Johnny knows how to raise money! The towers are built to drill for oil. Does Chicopee talk too much? A stranger comes to town. A truck rolls down the hill to cause an accident. Watch how swindlers work the suckers. ""Watchfob"" tells his stories. Miss Ann Evans drops by, and is accepted as Chicopee's sister.

But ownership of the well will pass to a rival if they don't strike oil by midnight. They try a desperate trick, and it works to bring in oil. Their fortune is assured. But somebody slugged the night watchman and set fire to the oil well! The film shows how they put out the roaring fire with explosives. When that fails they drop a cap on the well. More oil wells follow for a happy ending.

This drama has an interesting story and uses oil exploration as the background. It warns against being taken in by swindlers. In those days small businesses could be enriched by striking oil. Is that still possible today? If not, that tells something about today's politics. Big corporations passed laws to put small owners out of business.",1267401600,,1337,4.539419087136929
