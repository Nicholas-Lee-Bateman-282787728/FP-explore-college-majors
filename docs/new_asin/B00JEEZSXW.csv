8650175,3,B00JEEZSXW,"I have to praise this documentary because it exposes a country for its harsh laws against gay citizens that is vastly underreported. We hear about Uganda and Russia all the time but, according to this documentary, it would seem Jamaica is just as bad.

I also have to dock a few stars because the focus is so extraordinarily narrow that it's hard to get a true mental image of what it's like to be gay in Jamaica. We follow the lives of two individuals who have had hate crimes committed against them. One finds love in Canada, but returns occasionally to Jamaica to fight for gay rights. The other seeks asylum in the Netherlands. While their stories are horrific, they could easily be taken out of context to give the documentary an unrealistically tragic spin. You could probably make San Francisco look like Uganda if you only follow the lives of one or two people who have been harassed.

Anyway, I'm NOT saying that Jamaica is anything like San Francisco, but I do critique the documentary for not having a wider scope. It doesn't come across as well-researched enough to truly convince me of the direness of the country. It's certainly possible that it is just as bleak as presented, but ultimately I would have to do my own research to reach that conclusion.

I give it 3 stars because, like I say, no one is talking about Jamaica and this is an important film because it exposes how horrible the country treats its gay citizens. Minus 2 stars for the missed opportunities that could have made this truly great.",1404950400,,1519,4.618518518518519
8650176,5,B00JEEZSXW,I love this documentary so much and I have to keep watching it over and over. I'm from Jamaica and I can relate to this movie. I recommend that those living outside of Jamaica will have an opportunity to see what it's like living in Jamaica as a homosexual.,1403481600,,257,4.26530612244898
