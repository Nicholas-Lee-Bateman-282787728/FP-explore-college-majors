7873741,5,6304534299,"This drama shows that the more popular action
movies of Chow are a waste of his talent.  (This review
is based on the Cantonese version.)  Chow plays
""Ship-head"", an ex-sailer who have settled in NY as a
waiter who is among a group of immigrants with low
social status.  His love for
Chung (""Tea-pot"") pressures him
to improve himself.  Chow turns such a common and
physically unattractive role
into one of best loved figure in my culture.  The
emotions of ""Ship-head"" was very well captured and
developed without exaggeration (e.g. the
3 laws and 5 goals in the mirror written on the mirror).
The above should be universal to all culture.
As a cantonese native living in the US,
the Cantonese puns and sayings are trademarks of Chow,
and the scenes on life as foreigners are wonderfully gems.",1007251200,,793,4.717391304347826
7873742,5,6304534299,"A friend commented once that he wondered if the theme of unrequited love is a recurring one in Asian films, to which I replied, but of course.  As far as I can remember, the allure of romanticism is not so much in the happy ending of the couple who live happily ever after but in the thought of what could've been that stays forever.  It is a romance that will never fade as it lives only in your mind.
So what has that got to do with this movie?  This is a perfect example of that.  This is a tale about a woman (Chung) who comes to New York to meet her lover.  Instead of a ring, she gets snubbed for a richer, more sophisticated new girlfriend.  The only person she knows in the entire country is a distant cousin (Chow), a rough ruffian who knows love as much as Tarantino does romantic movies.  Slowly, a bond develops between the two bumbling losers and as fast as the love blossoms, the flame is extinguished when Chung moves on to take another job in other part of New York.
In the tradition of 'A Roman Holiday', the setting in a foreign land accentuates the romance.  They are the perfect strangers who are pushed together by the force of circumstance.  The chemistry between Chow and Chung work out great on screen and the acting, albeit low key, is very convincing.  Chow is a master of turning an ordinary character into one that instantly engages you and strikes you as interesting.
I first watched this film when it was released.  Years passed and I even forgot its title.  I never forgot the movie though (although I did the ending).  One day I decided that I wanted to see it again and looking at Chow's career history, I finally found the English title and managed to get my hands on a copy.  Talk about something that lives in my mind forever.",1005696000,2,1762,4.348623853211009

7873744,5,6304534299,"This film is one of the best showcases for chow's talents as an actor. A great story about romance, very touching. It was a very lowbudget production from hong kong shot in NY with the help of NYU. I found the  chemistry between Chow and Cherie very touching, and the lowbudget  production make it seem all the more realistic. Great NY backdrop.",932688000,6,345,4.548387096774194
