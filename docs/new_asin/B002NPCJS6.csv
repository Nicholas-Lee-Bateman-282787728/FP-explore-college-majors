8375275,4,B002NPCJS6,An excellent example of the krimi thriller of the 1960s. Part Horror and part comedy and all thrills. The killer runs around with a skeleton outfit with a mad laugh. The print is a bit worn but serviceable from Sinister Cinema.,1473292800,,227,4.560975609756097
8375276,5,B002NPCJS6,I love German Krimi movies no  matter how bad they actually are.,1463875200,,64,4.333333333333333
8375277,3,B002NPCJS6,"Hand of Power aka the Zombie Walks is about a person who kills people via a poisonous sharp object that springs out from a ring. This person is wearing this cool skeleton face & there is a great photo of it in Video Watchdog.
This is semi atmospheric. It is basically a revenge story - a person is assuming a new name & identity ( and that cool skull mask) to get revenge..for reasons that I will not reveal (aka no spoilers)
I will say the hero detective was also in The College Girl Murders and Curse of the Yellow Snake.
I personally found this to be a good solid effort, not quite as good ( only to me ) as College Girl Murders or some of the older black & white ones like Fellowship of the Frog ,etc.
Still its a fun flick and any fan of the Wallace series should check this one out.
The print from Sinister Cinema is decent. The only other way to get this movie is in this huge boxset from Germany where the transfers are stupendous, but it is in its original German language with no subtitles (some do & some don't from what I read)
This DVD from Sinister is suitable to me and fits with the other Wallace titles in my collection. English dubbed is perfectly fine for me",1284249600,5,1177,4.166666666666667
