5460610,3,B00ANRQBMQ,"The acting, singing, and music were fantastic. But, the costumes were not only out of period, but strange! Why can;t they make a Greek opera look like ancient Greece. You have trench coats and ninja military getup, and Iphigenia wears what appears to be a Islamic terrorist detonation belt. Is it the Netherlands or someone's university education that led to such strange production?",1364601600,20,383,5.095238095238095
5460611,5,B00ANRQBMQ,"You don't see productions of Iphignie en Aulide coming along very often, or indeed much of C.W. Gluck's works these days which, considering the importance of the composer to the world of opera, is something of a mystery.  Even more rarely do you see it paired the way it is here at the De Nederlandse Opera with its sister work Iphignie en Tauride, but the two works are perfectly complementary.  Composed at different times with a different approach to Gluck's reformist agenda, they were perhaps never intended to be performed together, but the pairing of the two works side-by-side like this at least allows those differences in approach - so important to the progress and development of the traditional form of the modern opera - to be better appreciated.

The subjects may be classical ones from Euripides, but by getting right back to basics of dramatic situation and expression, Gluck was able to find deeply human characteristics - love, anger, betrayal, vengeance - in mythological situations that elevated those feelings and emotions by placing them in the grander picture of questions of war, honour, duty, fate, destiny if you like, or the will of the Gods.  They are stories of great simplicity and utmost gravity, and they require little more - as Pierre Audi recognises here - than a few strong images and symbols to help define their essential characteristics and at the same time serve to link them together.  Played largely in the round, compressing the drama into a small area at the front of the stage and putting the orchestra at the back, with the chorus section arranged oratorio-style behind them, it's a stripped-down staging that works well in as far as it draws the full dramatic power out of the works.  Which is what Gluck is all about really.

It's hard then to fault the presentation and the careful equilibrium that is maintained by Marc Minkowski Les Musiciens du Louvre Grenoble in conjunction with the stage direction and the singing.  I've heard Iphignie en Tauride performed with more beauty and lyricism by William Christie and Les Arts Florissantes (in a Claus Guth production on DVD), but never quite so forcefully in a way that integrates it so well with the musical drama.  It's a spirited orchestral performance, wonderfully expressive, delivered with controlled ferocity in places even, but Minkowski also directs Iphignie en Aulide with consideration for how the individual works contrast with and complement the other.  Both works are performed moreover on period instruments tuned to the original pitch.

The singing is also strong in the performances of both works, with only Salom Haller's Diana common to both.  Iphigenia in Iphignie en Aulide is sung and performed marvellously by Veronique Gens with her customary attention to detail and the requirements of Baroque opera singing.  There are no mannerisms and no exaggeration by any of the performers, who treat the work with the necessary dramatic gravity and sincerity.  Surprisingly, as she is such a wonderful singer of Gluck, and has even recorded the role of Clytemnestra in this opera before, only Anne Sofie von Otter seemed underpowered and unable to match the intensity of the performances.

In Iphignie en Tauride, Iphegenia is sung by Mireille Delunsch, a soprano in a role that is more often sung by a mezzo-soprano.  More than just capably sung, Delunsch has a nice tone and timbre that suits arrangement here and proves to be strong enough to make the necessary impression.  The casting for this work however favours and puts more emphasis on the fate and the friendship of Orestes and Plyade.  Orestes is sung wonderfully by Jean-Franois Lapointe, who makes more of an impression as a true baritone than Plcido Domingo did at the Metropolitan Opera's production a few seasons ago.  He also works wonderfully off Yann Beuron's excellent Pylade, the two combined bringing another dimension to the work.

The presentation on Blu-ray is strong with a clear, bright and detailed image.  The audio mixes, on account of the acoustics, are a little bright and echoing, losing focus in the surround DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 mix.  The PCM track through headphones however reveals the qualities of the sound and the performances very well.  As well as two full-length operas on this release, there are also two 20-minute Behind the Scenes Introductions on the BD, one for each opera, and Cast Galleries.  The booklet contains an essay and two full synopses.  The BD is All-region compatible, with subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch and Korean.",1363564800,20,4558,5.029255319148936
8554813,5,B00ANRQBMQ,"The music is ravishing. However, like some others, I was put off by the stark, ugly steel poles of the set. My irritation wore off as the operas proceeded, but it is still a shame.",1501977600,,180,4.171428571428572
8554814,3,B00ANRQBMQ,"Opera News hit the nail on the head when it posted, in its review of this double bill: ""There is, deliberately, no beauty, no sense of place, atmosphere or period, and no dancing.""  In other words, no spectacle.  One might add the lack of staging (metal beachers do not count) or costumes (everyone in a variation of army fatigues).  Vocally and orchestrally sumptuous-- one might as well listen to it, since there is nothing much to see, and what there is, it is not worth it.  Frankly, I am becoming more  than bored with Nederlandse's Opera Audi/Minkowski productions.  I sarcastically thought to myself the show should have included Strauss' ""Electra"".  After all, it's one additional act only . . . . .  However, for the money, get this set, particularly since it has the only Iphigenie in Auliide on DVD.",1458950400,2,810,4.735714285714286
8554815,3,B00ANRQBMQ,"My comments concern the first opera in this set.

A great opera and performance undermined by the producer, director and costume designer.  I am not against a minimalist setting for Baroque operas especially when they concern ancient literature, history and myths.  Indeed, the ancients did not have the production capacity of the Met and people had to use their imaginations.  The music, lyrics, acting and singing in this production was well up to the task to bring forward the full force of the opera.  Five stars here.

It really bothers me that such a fine performance has to be undermined by the set, director, costume designer etc.  First the aluminum stands that were supposed to be the steps of the temple and palace were tacky.  The costumes, military fatigues, were just foolish, especially on the women.

But the great interpretive flaw is when Iphigenie comes to her sacrifice wearing a vest of explosives.  What in the world were they thinking?  Here Iphignie chooses self-sacrifice to propitiate the gods with her own blood.  An explosive vest is designed to kill others.  Iphignie's act was to sacrifice herself for the Greeks, her father and Achilles as they prepare to go to war with Troy.  Dianna, the goddess, sings as much in the final aria as Iphignie is spared for her nobility.

A terrorist wearing a belt of explosives designed to kill others is the antithesis of nobility and has nothing whatsoever to do with the story much less the message.  Whoever thought up and whoever sanctioned such an interpretation gets a ""F"" and should count his/herself fortunate there is no real Dianna that would require their life!

Producers:  Please grow up and get over this post-modern drivel.  Enough!",1419552000,4,1714,4.93006993006993
8554816,4,B00ANRQBMQ,"Now, how to rate these Iphigeniae?  Normally I detest modernized productions, but these seem to work ... in a way.  Perhaps because they are mostly talky operas, with not much action, an alternate setting seems a little more palatable.  And ""alternate"" is probably the key word here--it is far more an alternate setting than a modernized one.  In fact, it's almost Dali-esque.  And I will go ahead and say it.  The alternate setting lets one focus on the psychological drama, rather than on the togas and columns etc.  (That all said, I still would not want to be without the traditional 2002 video from Muti/La Scala.)

The worst thing here is not the non-traditional stage setting, it's the poorly-engineered subtitles.  Like so many blu-rays, the subtitles are tiny and hard to read.  Especially, being white subtitles, when they're shown against a white background.  Why does not someone think of these things when they're planning their professional designs?

Musically and vocally, the production is beyond reproach.  However, we have to include the video element in the review.  Otherwise, what's the point of having a video?  Four stars is generous considering everything.  I suppose I am in a generous mood on Gluck's birthday.  Now if only every day could be Gluck's birthday :)

To enjoy these operas, be sure you do your homework in advance.  You must know the entire story from beginning to end before starting the opera.  Even if the subtitles were legible, they wouldn't give you the arc of the story in these particular operas--and that would hold true regardless of production or era of setting.  Know the story in advance and then the viewing and listening experience will be most rewarding.",1404259200,,1709,4.968197879858657
8554817,5,B00ANRQBMQ,"I approached this recording of my beloved Gluck opera classics with a little trepidation. The Netherlands Opera I knew from other productions (Mara Stuarda) as being extreme modern in treatment of the operatic setting; not the wholesale boorishness of the German ""Regie Eurotrash"" afflicted on their productions of Handel' beautiful melodic scores but what ""modern"" would they do to the intense delicate beauty of Glucks fragile singular lines. About twenty minutes into the music I saw that with Marc Minkowsky and Les Musiciens du Louvre doing percision, masterly playing there was nothing to worry about. Yes the sets are steel rods and factory staircases and there is no artful ediface in sight but I could see that this approach focused the force of the dialogue just as it would have with the Euripides play in the Greek arena theatre.
Even as the soldiers rushed around in modern day Duck Dynasty fatigues, rifles, bazookas etc. it made the point that modern uncivil militarist behavior was the same in 5th century mythic time and a god or gods was always claimed as the author of the carnage. Even that horrible detonation belt so popular among muslim suicide bombers was appropriate for the Aulide Iphigenie because a god told her to do it. Yes this production is of searing dramatic intensity.
The Aulide opera was written in 1774 and is concentrated on the young innocent girl tricked by her father with promise of marriage into coming to this northern island where the Greek navy is stymied by the becalmed winds. Neither she nor her mother Clytemnestra, nor her fiancee' Achilles  knew that she was really going to be sacrificed to a god to make the winds blow again and procede with the Trojan war. When she realizes that she is to be a victim her young mind turns this silly tragedy around and makes it a noble cause. Her rationalizing is the subject of the long recitative to her mother and then to her fiancee'. It is the high point of the opera and a thing of great beauty especially as given by Veronique Gens. She is exquisite. Her singing was almost painfully beautiful. Tears did flow. It was a stunning  performance and the best I've seen of this role. Strangely Gluck gave this opera a happy (unsatisfactory) ending. She is relieved of her sacrifice and is to marry Achilles. Other endings have been given and Gluck was never happy with the ""happy"" one.
Iphagenie en Tauride came some five years later in 1779. It is more personal and dramatically intense and less inherently beautiful the ""Aulide"". Here she is 15 years older and wiser and somewhat hardened of heart. She was banashed here with a few other Greek women  to a place of barbarian Scythians (present day Russia). She is a priestess of Diana and bowing to the local custom must sacrifice any stranger  who happens to land on the shore (a barbarian act) carried out with a Greek double-headed hand axe. How she got there is never explained but we know that her Achilles was killed in the Trojan War.
The Iphigenie in this cast is Mirelle Delunsch and she also is magnificent.  She is cool-headed, rational, almost filled with futility and is devoid of happiness or ""romance"". That is until she recognizes that the stranger whom she is about to kill is her own brother Orestes. Then happines and joy again flood her heart. Ms. Delunsch intense delivery is fantastic. She goes through the entire gamut of womanly emotions and conveys all truely and seriously. She is a phenomenon to experience. In the end Orestes and his friend Pylades and she are to return to Mycenae.
This is a superb disc with all singers, actors and chorus doing top notch work. It is so full of detail and the music is so intense it will take several listenings to truly compehend the stark beauty of these great works.",1388016000,4,3776,4.732522796352583
8554818,1,B00ANRQBMQ,This was just weird. The modern setting did not match the opera. The voices were excellent but the setting ruined it.,1374710400,12,117,4.619047619047619
8554819,5,B00ANRQBMQ,"While I can't really add to the outstanding reviews submitted by Nine and Bruno (except to reiterate how outstanding Vronique Gens and Anne Sofie von Otter are in their performances), I can give a little more information about the setting.  Both operas on this release are set in a stylized, militarized modern-day setting.  While I would normally prefer a more traditional setting (especially when viewing operas for the first time), I really enjoyed this interpretation.  The orchestra is set on the stage, behind the performers, and the chorus is set behind the orchestra.

Les Musiciens du Louvre play beautifully, and Marc Minkowski does an expert job conducting these performances.  The Blu-ray picture is crisp and clear, and the sound production can't be bettered, despite the slight echo at De Nederlandse Opera Het Muziektheater.  Extras include behind-the-scenes documentaries for each opera, and a set of trailers for other Opus Arte releases.  I would love to have seen a documentary on Gluck as an extra, but I won't take any stars away from my review.",1369699200,7,1066,5.127167630057803
8554820,4,B00ANRQBMQ,"By the early 1770s Christoph Willibald von Gluck (1714-1787) was dissatisfied with the reception of his latest operas in Vienna. He selected Paris as a city in which to try his luck with a comparatively new and still-evolving operatic idea - that of imbuing the characters with emotions such as love, fear, anger, rage, and jealousy. Henry Purcell (1659-1695) introduced such feeliings into his opera ""Dido and Aeneas"" (1688), but the concept caught on relatively slowly. For both his 1774 opera ""Iphigenie en Aulide"" and its 1779 sequel ""Iphigenie en Tauride,"" Gluck drew upon classical stories from Euripides and composed some of his most adventurous music. He included an unusually high number of ensembles and a wide variety of musical structures and devices. He blended Italianate forms, such as the extended solo aria, with more French devices, such as the short, declamatory ariette, to produce truly masterful operas.
Time and the ever-changing tastes of concert-goers have a disconcerting habit of shouldering aside once-popular composers. Thus performances of Gluck's operas are rare nowadays. Some devotees of them may therefore welcome this DVD double album, but I am not entirely happy with it. ""Iphigenie en Aulide"" has a superb cast and is highly recommended. I wish that I could be as enthusiastic about ""Iphigenie en Tauride."" To describe the cast as ""satisfactory but not optimal"" seems dismissive, but that is my reaction to this production. Some Gluck-lovers might be happier with other performances of ""Tauride.""

8554821,5,B00ANRQBMQ,"The standard narrative of musicology has always been that Christoph Willibald Gluck (1714-1787) was the key reformer of opera history, who swept away the conventions of ""opera seria"" as they had congealed in the libretti of Metastasio, who purged operatic music of ""recitativo secco"" and the monumental repetitiveness of the da capo aria, who put those flashy ornamentalizing singers in their proper place of subordination to the composer, and who set the table for the symphonic operas of Wagner. However, as is often true, the accepted wisdom leaves a lot out of account. It's a long century from Gluck to Wagner, during which da capo and bel canto continued to thrive and the libretti of Metastasio were set to music as eagerly as Gluck himself had done both before and after his ""reforms"" in Vienna in the 1760s. Gluck's best pupil turned out to be Antonio Salieri, that backward-looking composer of opera buffa. Haydn's and Paisiello's operas show little response to Gluck's concerns. Mozart composed one patently Gluckian opera -- Idomeneo in 1780/81 -- using an Italian adaptation of a French libretto from 1712. It's an atypically static drama (with lovely music of course) that has never competed for stage time with Mozart's comic and tragicomic masterpieces. Over the next several generations of composers, only the Medea of Cherubini mimics the intensity of Gluck's Iphigenie en Tauride.

Meanwhile, with the successful revival of operas of Lully and Rameau, by conductors and singers of HIPP persuasion, we mere listeners have a perspective on Gluck that the academic musicologists never had. We can hear how obviously Gluck found his musical idiom in the French Baroque tradition. Not just the language of the two Iphigenies is French; the style of recitation, the fluidity of sequencing from recitation to aria (including da capo), and indeed the whole affect of the opera is best heard as the culmination of that French tradition. Gluck himself knew as much when he hastened from Vienna to Paris in the 1770s.

The libretto for Iphigenie en Aulide (1774) is closer to the drama by Racine than to Homer, while the libretto for Iphigenie en Tauride (1779) is based on a French text derived from Euripedes. The conclusion of the former is not entirely consistent with the premise of the latter; nonetheless, staging the two works together is a brilliant idea. ""Aulide"" ends poorly and unconvincingly as a dramatic statement but the psycho-mythic intensity of ""Tauride"" redeems it. Likewise, the music of Tauride is so monumental and memorable that Aulide sounds like a preface, just as the first act of Berlioz's ""Les Troyens,"" in Troy, becomes a warm-up for the latter action in Carthage. Berlioz is far more aptly recognized than Wagner as the great-grandchild of Gluck.

This tandem production was first staged in Amsterdam by De Nederlandse OPera in September 2011, using the same set and many of the same costumes for both. It's a brutally 'modern' set composed of steel scaffolding and stairs on either side of a stage that stands behind the always-visible orchestra. Was the audience distributed fore and aft? And the chorus? As in ancient Greek theater, the chorus takes the secondary role of an audience of commenters. The costumes are brutal also. Ugly! Military drab, camouflage colors, beribboned uniforms for officers, lots of machine guns and even a suicide vest! Calchas, in the first opera, is patently a ""commissar"" of a police state. Thoas, the king of the Scythians in Tauride, is a blood-lusting sadist with a sexually charged dominance his priestess Iphigenie. I can hear the wails of outrage from opera fans committed to ""traditional"" stagings. But what tradition is there? Baroque operas based on Greek and Roman sources were NOT staged in togas or with classical nudity! Would a staging of Tauride in powdered wigs and 18th C greatcoats seem less anachronistic? How else could a stage director - in this case the redoubtable Pierre Audi - achieve the emotional impact of Opera Seria except by shrouding it with the context of tyranny and warfare? Hey, the Trojan War was nasty business! And this is Gluck with guts!

The musical values of these performances are equally gutsy. Conductor Marc Minkowski coaxes every bit of energy and pathos from the orchestral scores. His Tauride is musically far more ferocious than the older Zurich performance on DVD conducted by Bill Christie, though that also was exquisite.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christoph-Williabald-Gluck-Iphigenie-en-Tauride-Galstian-Gilfry-van-der-Walt-Christie-Guth-Opernhaus-Zurich/dp/B000FII2DE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christoph Williabald Gluck - Iphigenie en Tauride / Galstian, Gilfry, van der Walt, Christie, Guth (Opernhaus Zurich)</a>&nbsp;Minkowski's Tauride could really be heard as a harbinger of Wagner. But the glory of both operas is the singing. In Aulide, it's the musical tension of Nicolas Test as Agamemnon, the heroic tenor of Frederic Antoun as Achille, the the smooth virtuosity of Veronique Gens as Iphigenie. Tauride belongs to the guys: Jean-Franois Lapointe as Oreste and Yann Beiron as Pylade. Their dialogue recitatives and their duets are emotionally captivating as well as superbly sung. (It's worth recalling that self-sacrificing friendship had been the theme of the many settings of the libretto L'Olimpiade by Metastasio, which Gluck must have known well.) The only weakness in this performance - visually and musically - is the Diane, sung by Salom Haller. It's a small role vocally, one that could be sung by many, so I have to wonder why a more majestic Diana could not have been selected, or why some trappings of majesty could not have been lent to poor Haller, who looks more like a grouchy housewife than an almighty Goddess.

I've never before been as entranced by Gluck - on stage, on CD, on DVD - as by this double whammy of a production. Makes me want to say ""Ahh! Now I get it! What matters wasn't his role as a reformer but rather the genius of his music.""",1368144000,8,6050,5.226570545829042
8554822,4,B00ANRQBMQ,"These performances are a mixed bag. Orchestra under Minkowski is superb. The staging is not to my liking, and it is almost a concert in costume. However, the Aulide is a an excellent performance by the singers, especially Veronique Gens. but all the cast is very, very good  As the only Aulide on DVD it is a must for all Gluck devotees, as it is very well sung and acted..
The Tauride is not in the same class, as Delunsch is not right for the role,the rest do not impress either and there are many alternative versions around.",1366416000,3,528,4.387755102040816
