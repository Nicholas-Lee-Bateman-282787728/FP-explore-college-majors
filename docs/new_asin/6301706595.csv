bought this product had no way of knowing that it was not finished so there for it could not play.  Once the 2 ends were spliced & taped together by me it was able to play",1433116800,,337,3.7857142857142856

7815880,1,6301706595,"While watching this generally foolish film, one is apt to recognize that every element of the storyline has been done before, and done better, since it is not merely weakly produced by its writer/director, but its gauzy plot and cardboard characters offer no redeeming qualities in return, certainly not laughter from an alleged comedy.  Action begins as wealthy poolside lounging Edward Harris (Adam West) addresses the camera (often a sign of lack of originality to come), describing to viewers his spoiled daughter Cassandra, or ""Casey"" (Claudia Christian) upon whom he dotes, and her lack of commitment to a career of his choosing, and shortly thereafter we are shown the young woman at the wheel of her vintage convertible, flirting and otherwise appearing quite vapid.  However, we are told that this can not be an accurate judgement of Casey, her father informing us that she is so brilliant that he is trying to manipulate her into taking over his corporation's public relations office, this prompted by her occasional acts of clever maneuvering displayed at the firm's board meetings, a corner of her sire's world in which she plainly has no interest at all.  Instead of focussing upon the corporate world, Casey has an obvious desire to find a lover, and in a tedious series of silly sequences she is courted by three widely disparate types -- a rock musician-cum-waiter, a professional football player, and (her father's selection) an ambitious yuppie, while her best friend Renee (Shari Shattuck) is available and highly willing to accept those whom Casey discards.  To the average non-comatose viewer, it could not matter less which of the trio Casey chooses, since all of the film's characters lack appeal, and a majority of scenes are so trite as to be utterly forgettable, with Shattuck, an able actress, working herself into an overwrought state with her silly part as a temptress on the prowl.  One will have no trouble in scrubbing off the memory of this trivial nougat with its artless attempts at humour that are simply vulgarity, and puerile exuberance by the players, Christian sheepishly grinning through much of it and probably marvelling as to why she took on the assignment for this poorly scripted, directed, acted and edited film.",1143763200,3,2259,5.061827956989247
