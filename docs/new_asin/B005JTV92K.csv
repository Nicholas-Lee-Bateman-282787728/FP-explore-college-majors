8476026,3,B005JTV92K,"I enjoyed this movie as historical re-creation, and I liked the characters and storytelling. Be advised, without my spoiling anything, that the plot does not withstand scrutiny.",1389139200,,177,5.592592592592593
8476027,5,B005JTV92K,"You name it and this movie has it, as well as a few surprises.  Holland is also the place Anne Frank wrote her diary if that gives you any insight of what you are about to see.  It's obvious why this movie won so many of the film festival awards.  The acting, the story and the emotions all bundled into the movie are truly five star.",1380672000,2,334,4.03030303030303
8476028,5,B005JTV92K,Great movie for history buffs and the like.  I won't give away the plot but the history itself is worth your time.,1361664000,,114,4.181818181818182
8476029,4,B005JTV92K,"This was a very good story and the actors where refreshing because unlike some American actors they are not in every other film you see.... I don't into the plot and all the college words and turn my review into a figging novel... It was well acted, intense, all about the German's taking over Holland. It kept my attention from beginning to end one of those films that you really do not think of your life or problems the entire time. Please rent ir ot buy it, its an eye opener... fresh never done before which is such a relief cause every War 2 German take over is the same old, same old... this steps above what u may have seen.... like the boy in the stripped pajamas.... only that was NOT a true story, though neither was this one... enjoy it... its worth watching.",1341532800,,771,4.324137931034483
