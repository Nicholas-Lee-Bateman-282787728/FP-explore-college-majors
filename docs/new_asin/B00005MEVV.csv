1625364,4,B00005MEVV,"I withheld one star due to not being in WideScreen (plus would it be asking too much for subtitles on the behind-the-scenes stuff?).  But for the rest, I love the tragic story, the music, and the fight scenes (yes, I am a chic that loves a good fight scene).  Plus as a chic I also like the fact that Asian movies like most British movies have realistic women, unlike American Hollywood that think only pretty women have inflated breasts (come on when they defy grafity and sit on the shoulder not the ribcage - you're not fooling anyone) and lipo suctioned bodies.  Plus this movie also demonstrate a truly strong female character, just like the male characters.  So I say more power to film makers who can make a movie like this that is a good balance of story and action.",1012694400,,774,4.468085106382978
1625365,5,B00005MEVV,"I watched this movie in amazement--it was spectacularly beautiful in some scenes--there is no other way to describe it except that it's like an anime movie come to life (solo scenes of the wind blowing through the main character's hair, etc.). The movie also seemed to blend together Korean, Chinese, and Japanese influences, which also made it interesting. It is full of intense and fantasy-like martial arts fighting scenes, but the love story is what truly holds the plot together.",1012521600,,484,5.0625
1625366,2,B00005MEVV,the only reason i watch this movie is because i need to see Kim HeeSun in traditional Korean costume..coz she's mad FOINE! storywise...this's not more then a hero saving damsel in distress kind...very dissappointing since i heard so much good reviews about it. the action scenes are not that bad though...since they hired HongKong martial artists/stuntmen to cheograph & body double all the fights. i know this coz i happened to watch some clips of the making....and trust me Crouching Tiger is wayyy worth watching.,1005350400,,516,5.08235294117647

1625368,5,B00005MEVV,"Ok Martial Arts Action Fans,
This is THE ONE to pounce on!! This movie makes 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' look like a Saturday Matinee. I've had this movie on VHS format for almost a year, and let me tell you, I STILL CAN'T GET ENOUGH. Even though it's in its original Korean Dialog without any subtitles...I DON'T CARE. The Visual and Sound F/X Are Unique and Brilliant. When have you ever heard gun shot ricochets used as sound effects for someone getting slashed with a sword. This was meant for DVD. Trust me, if you have one or know a friend who does, go and watch this movie on a DIGITAL FLAT SCREEN TV or at least a 32""-52"" TV.
IN SHORT, this movie is beyond fantastic; only being shadowed by 1999's 'THE STORM RIDERS' (which is THE BEST yet[Sorry Bruce, but Enter The Dragon is now just the legend that paved the way]).
Take my advice GET THIS DVD & 'THE STORM RIDERS' while you're at it. RIGHT NOW!...
Look out Ang Lee, the Korean Invasion has begun...IN A BIG WAY!!
So says,
KAN WOO",998524800,5,996,4.360215053763441
1625369,5,B00005MEVV,"I highly recommend this DVD.  The story-line is so bittersweet.  The music is haunting and the direction and cinematography is very good.  The fighting sequences are well orchestrated and are cool to watch.  There is something for everyone in this movie.
Synopsis (taken from the back): At the end ot the Yuan Dynasty, when Mongolia was ruling all of the Chinese continent, the Mongolians, the Hans, and the Koryo (ancient Korean) migrant were going through racial conflicts whle experiencing the strife of local baron rivalry.
Jinha, son of a Koryo migrant fall for Sullie, illegitimate daughter of a Mongolian commander.  After some time, Jinha founds out the secret of his parents' death and the legacy of the Bichun Secret Arts left to him.  Sullie's father, Taruga wants to kill Jinha for these secrets...the lovers find themselves separated with Sullie forced to marry the local baron's son and Jinha falling off a cliff...ten years pass and Jinha is reborn as Jahalang, a hired assasin, and is back for revenge.  This martial-arts love story depicts the conflicts that the lovers face, as they struggle with their starcrossed fate...",997920000,5,1140,5.096774193548387
1625370,4,B00005MEVV,"I thought this movie was pretty cool and the fighting reminded me of the legendery swordsman movie. The storyline wasn't all that but that didn't affect the movie much. Overall I think this is the best movie to come out of korea yet,well at least it better than that dumb movie ""nowhere to hide"". Take my word for if you want a movie  with romance and fighting together this is a keeper, i should know i saw it at my friends' house , he had the tape version.",997747200,,458,4.204545454545454
1625419,1,B00005MEVV,"I just finished watching this movie, and I have to say that it  was the most incomprehensible movie I have ever seen, and no, I didn't forget to put the English subtitles on.  In fact, I speak Korean, so the confusion wasn't due to sloppy translating.  I can't help but wonder if the other reviewers who spoke of it as the greatest movie ever speak either language.

I guessed I should have known that it stunk, when the highest accolade it received was biggest budget in Korean history.  They sure didn't spend any of that money for high quality writing.  Not only did characters pop in and out at seemingly random intervals, without explanation of who they are or where they came from (or why?), but the love story itself doesn't make any sense.  First they love each other, then they hate each other for no apparent reason, iterate indefinitely.  It almost felt like it was some movie I would flip to during commercials of a TV show. I mean, only from reading the back of the package, did I learn that the main character became an assassin for hire.  They sure don't tell you in the movie.

Furthermore, the main character himself is a self-indulgent, loathsome creature whom you are expected to cheer for, but only wish his ""rival in love"" had prevailed in the end.  It would have been much better for everyone, including the audience.

This film is dark blemish on the conscience of South Korea, an otherwise wonderful country.",1106352000,17,1432,4.616600790513834
1625420,5,B00005MEVV,"This Korean martial arts film is one of the best Martial Arts films I have seen as of yet! It relies as much on the romantic/revenge plot as the cinematography and the fight scenes. It is lyrical, majestic and utterly captivating. I too wanted to ""dance with the sword"" after watching this. Great movie!!! It is the essential Romeo and Juliet plot and yet it is so much more. It is stunning and a dizzying swirl of beauty. A great period piece in Korean cinema. The only detracting quality of this movie is the soundtrack and its descrepancy with scene. There is this rock sounding song pulsating out of a scene that really doesn't fit in the time period or the tone. But overall great movie!",1105660800,11,692,4.5
1625421,2,B00005MEVV,"The claim to be the highest budget film in Korean history did nothing to help this movie.  The fight scenes were unimpressive, the story is basic revenge deal and lots characters are underdeveloped so you don't really miss them when they are killed.",1103500800,6,249,4.790697674418604
1625422,4,B00005MEVV,"In short there are a number of flix worth seeing; but some are worth buying and others, you'd be better off renting and calling it a day. The top of my list are ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", and ""Hero"". The quality of the films are vastly superior than anyhting I've seen so far over the past couple of years. But then you still have a number that are still quality films worth being in your dvd list ... like ""House of Flying Daggers"" (beautifully shot by the way... but still in shadow of the forementioned movies), and ""Duel"", then to lesser extents the ""Legend""'s (great fights), ""Butterfly, Comet, and Sword"" and ""Twin Warriors"". When all is said and done, Bichunmoo was a pretty satisfying movie...lots of action and swordplay, tons of ""wire-fu"" (gotta love it) and a decent plot and story line (love story as most revolve around). The quality / cinematography could have been better... but the sheer number of fight scenes; if nothing else, keep you waiting to see if they can top the last fight. Not the top of the line but a decent flick, worth a couple of dollars to have in your collection.",1102982400,6,1105,4.585858585858586
1625423,4,B00005MEVV,"Another reviewer mentioned that Jinha and Sullie, the main characters of Bichunmoo, are ""Star-Crossed Lovers,"" and he is exactly right...they are THE star-crossed lovers: Romeo and Juliet.  Bichunmoo is a superb re-imagining of Shakespeare's classically beautiful tragedy, told through the lens of ancient China.  The story, having a fully imagined story on which to draw, is superbly told.

One of the only problems with the story is that the background between Sullie and Jinha is established in one long flashback, rather than being remembered a little bit at a time, and the visual effects here are sometimes slightly amateurish, but the effects throughout the rest of the film are wonderfully created.

You will not see anything on par with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, as far as effects go, but this is as close as any Korean movie has ever come.  As a retelling of Romeo and Juliet, Bichunmoo is an excellent film, and it would be equally excellent if there were no element of the Shakespearean tragedy present.  I highly recommend it, and the only problem I can find with it is the sometimes amateurish special effects.",1100649600,3,1130,5.016042780748663
1625424,5,B00005MEVV,"Bichunmoo is a story of love between a Korean boy and Chinese girl spanning their lives.  The Korean is a great martial artist and the keeper of a secret technique called the Bichun Secret.  There is friendship, love, betrayal, revenge, and forgiveness in this tale.

Beautifully shot and acted with wonderful action and story, this movie is only held back by the fact that they try to do too much.  The pacing is off, almost as if there where scenes that were completely left out.  Beacuse of this problem the story can become confusing.  Watch it a couple times and things will fall into place and you will see the beauty of the story they are telling.",1099267200,4,654,4.547008547008547
1625425,2,B00005MEVV,"I wonder if the movie I saw is the same that many of the others here have reviewed?  The fight scenes are fun and imaginative, but the story is very poorly constructed.  The best word I can use to describe the plot is `choppy'.  It's almost as if the movie is an adaptation of a famous novel or legend everyone should know and that the director decided it was sufficient to touch upon the major points in the story and ignore the details.

The entire movie is filled with scenes that don't logically follow the last, again, as if it is assumed the viewer should already be intimately familiar with the work; or that half of the movie was poorly edited out at the last minute.  Major new characters are introduced with no warning, and significant events unfold with no exposition or apparently take place off-screen entirely.  It's not that you can't follow what's going on, exactly, but Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon this movie is not.

It's strictly Okay, but nothing special.  I'm not going to throw it into the trash can or anything, but I'm glad I bought it used.",1094256000,4,1068,4.554973821989528
1625426,5,B00005MEVV,"An epic love story set during the Yuan dynasty in China.  Our protagonist is a young Koryu named Jinha who, after narrowly escaping death, returns as an assassin bent on revenge against those responsible for destroying his life with an aristocratic woman named Sullie.  Constantly pursued by those who desire the Buchun Secrets (an incredibly powerful martial art), Jinha and Sullie's lives become wrapped in bloodshed and tragedy.  The ending of this movie has to be the saddest thing I've ever seen on film so be forwarned.
As a side note, the version available in the US is the Chinese version.  When you watch this, it will automatically play the Chinese dubbed track.  I HIGHLY suggest you switch it over to its original Korean track.  I realize that most people will not be able to understand either of the languages, however, bad dubbing is bad dubbing no matter what language it's in.",1087948800,5,892,4.8355263157894735

1625428,5,B00005MEVV,"This movie was very good.  At first I was very hesitant in watchig it; but as the movie began, I didn't stop it at all.  If you like martial arts movies, amazing sword fights, a bitter love story, then this movie is for you!
The most impressive thing about this movie was it's creativity in story and fighting cheoreography.  Very suprised that Koreans could make a movie equivalent to that of Hong Kong action films.

This had a lot going for it, but was just dragging along with cheesey old fashioned action sequences.  Yuch!!
The love story took forever, and after awhile, I could care less!  If you like slow-paced, slogging thru mud storylines, along with chincy action sequences - then this one's for you!
Me?  I'll stick with the better made movies, such as AZUMI and the 7 Samurai, just to name a couple more...",1079136000,,580,4.611650485436893
1625440,2,B00005MEVV,"I am a big, long-time martial arts movie fan AND a recent intro to Korean films. I had just seen Joint Security Area and Musa:The Warrior so I was really excited to when I saw this at my video store.
My first disapointment came- it was dubbed, and dubbed in just as corny a fashion as the old HK movies used to be. Then there was the production values, which again were throwbacks to the HK 70's. Not 80's or early 90's- yes the 70's. I can be forgiving of the old classics due to technology, but not a modern film. The same goes for Korean films, there are several that are better.
Then came the story- it was leaden and wooden. The movie moved at a SLLLOOOWWW pretentious pace, a mistake that the Hong Kong directors NEVER made. If a Hong Kong fu movie wasn't too good, so what it's quick and fast moving. Not this one. It was torture.
I nearly turned it off, but my wife told us to push through.
It never really got better. The movie does have some good fight scenes, but overall it's a big disapointment. If you want to see a top-notch korean martial arts film- gets Musa:The Warrior. Pass this turkey bye.",1077494400,4,1110,4.265402843601896
1625441,3,B00005MEVV,"It's a good martial art movie, but I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed.  The fighting scenes were pretty jerky, ala Chinese soap opera of yester-years.  While there were good cinematography and post editting, they just weren't enough to make the movie beyond par.  I was completely unbias when watching this movie, hence the lackadaisical review.  Now, once I start to think that this is a Korean martial art film, then I didn't feel too bad.  Although it's not on the same level as their Chinese counter part, it does show that the Korean crews are getting a lot better.
Get it if you want to add a decent Korean martial movie to your collection.  If you don't give a hoot where the movie comes from, then get Crouching Tiger.  Of course, since you already have that one already, get the better version -- Hero (w/ Jet Li) :)  Don't know if they are selling it on Amazon yet, but look around, they are available on various sites.  Now, there's a FIVE STAR!",1058745600,2,967,4.448863636363637
1625442,5,B00005MEVV,"The comparisons to Crouching Tiger, Storm Riders and The Duel-type films and the Korean Bichunmoo are certainly justified: it IS a kung fu, sword flick, flavored with a love story. But Bichunmoo is a masterpiece in itself that can stand up to these comparisons; you can even argue that this, the most well-rounded of these type of films to date, should be the standard to which the others, even the cinematographically superior Crouching Tiger, should be compared to.
At the heart of the story are Jinha Yu and Sullie, whose tragic, star-crossed relationship is the thread that holds the movie together. She is rich and Mongol royalty; he is an orphaned Koryo commoner (or so we are made to believe), and fate refuses to let the relationship take place. The pair elopes and are hunted down by Sullie's family and Jungkwang, a young lord her family favors. Despite Jinha's expertise in the legendary Bichin Secrets, rumored to be the most powerful of all martial arts, passed on to him by a dying uncle, he succumbs to the pursuers and falls from a cliff. Sullie reluctantly marries Jungkwang.
The years go by and while Jungkwang is away on business, his castle falls quite easily to another faction, thanks to a group of highly skilled assassins headed by a bitter, darker, cold-blooded Jinha. Trouble follows as both struggle to reconcile who they once were with what they have become.
Bichunmoo trumps Crouching Tiger in that the story is self-contained, not a mere snapshot. We see Jinha and Sullie develop not only relationship-wise, but as children meeting for the first time and growing to adulthood. In contrast Li Mubai and Shulien (of Crouching Tiger) are captured in mid-life, with plenty of history between them the we never get to know. The cinematic feel isn't as grand, and is more like the Once Upon A Time In China series--basically shot like early Jet Li and Jackie Chan films.
But there is grandeur to it--the beautiful shots of Sullie mourning and waiting for Jinha, or her deceiving dance in front of the emperor, or the flashbacks to their childhood--all utilize the soft, slow-motion, leaves floating, silk flying atmosphere. The swordfights are somewhere between Crouching Tiger and The Duel--more CG special effects than Crouching Tiger and more choreography and martial arts skill than The Duel.
Bichunmoo has no real weak spots. The back story is extensive enough to make you feel like you know the characters, but not so overwhelming that it creates questions. The battles and love scenes all have a purpose, with no chance encounters or accidental street brawls. The lack of star power is in name only; Shin Hyun-Jun's brooding, tormented Jinha is convincingly depressing, revengeful and regretful, as Kim Hae-Sun's Sullie is beautiful, determined and vulnerable. Your girl can shed tears and use up the Kleenex, while you watch with dropped jaw at the spectacular metalwork, slicing and dicing with superhuman effects.
Be sure to turn the DVD language setting to Korean; it usually defaults to the Chinese voice, which will create an unsettling voice-not-matching-mouth viewing. Don't worry, the Korean cast is extremely talented. No martial arts or Asian film collection would be complete without it; other film collectors won't just be diversifying but upgrading their DVD shelves. A well-deserved five stars for the biggest budget film in Korean history.",1053993600,50,3386,5.06989247311828
1625443,5,B00005MEVV,"Right off, I'll admit my bias.  This film fills a niche in my collection of martial arts movies I've been wanting to work on, since I'm most interested in Korean martial arts.  The strengths of this movie include some absolutely stunning sets and solid (if somewhat exaggerated) fight choreography.  The plot, while twisting and somewhat strange, is well above average for the martial arts genre, though it lacks the subtlety of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  The special effects accompanying the secret ""bichun"" arts on which the film centers are more than passingly reminiscent of certain videogames, and so seemed more funny than dramatic to me.  These effects, along with the superhuman abilities of the main characters, may turn off those who strongly prefer realism, but if you don't mind fantasy in your martial arts, this shouldn't be a problem.  Overall, I recommend this movie to anyone who follows the martial arts genre.  It is one of the best such films from a production standpoint I've seen.  Thus, while not on the level of the very best in the genre (examples; Seven Samurai, Crouching Tiger), it is still up there, and is a sign that Korean filmmakers may make some valuable contributions to the genre in the future.",1032652800,4,1236,4.93719806763285
1625444,5,B00005MEVV,"great movie.  if you watch it alone, you have a better chance of really understanding it (since people like me hide emotions in the presence of others).  the action is not easily comparable to crouching tiger.  crouching tiger is more westernized, where the camera angle is far back enough so you can see the whole fighting scene.  bichunmoo keeps w/ typical asian martial art flicks:  fast camera action, things going on all over the screen.  that's why it's hard to see the maneuvers that the actors pull off.  sul-lie is so fine.  so is the woman who ironically poisons jin-ha (ironic because...you know how it ends).  so is the sister of the guy who saved jin-ha (i forget her name).  i heard a person say jin-ha made a mistake by leaving it all behind in the end.  but to me, this is honor.  sul-lie was married, though her man met tragic fate.  jin-ha and sul-lie had travelled different paths.  it was fate that they would always love eachother.  but it was also fate that forbid them from being with eachother (until they died, together).  it just wasn't meant to be.  and jin-ha did the right thing by leaving it all behind.
  LOYALTY.  you don't find such loyalty in american movies.  esp. the head of the 10 swordsmen.  when he was told that jin-ha was dead, and he therefore had an opportunity for a higher rank, he instead murdered the messenger.  that is the love that a man can have for another man.
but lemme get tech for a second.  the dvd has a skip in transition from scene 7 to scene 8 (watch the dvd digital panel if you don't believe me), just after an hour into the movie.  it is this long pause.  i ordered another copy, but it skipped at the same spot.  so i figured it was my dvd player.  but the same thing happened on another dvd player.  so i will just have to live with that skip now.  it's only one skip, but as a consumer, i shouldn't have to expect ANY skips.",1025308800,4,1892,4.353448275862069
1625445,4,B00005MEVV,"Many compared this movie to Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon (CTHD). While there are many similarities, the more apt analogy is Pontiac GTO vs. refined BMW. Bichunmoo has a number of rough edges. It just blasts through many well-choreographed sword fights with rock music, but can't turn corners as smoothly as CTHD. It shamelessly exploits tears from the opening scene as if warning us to bring tissue papers before it's too late and you end up embarrassing yourself.
Moreover, it tries too hard to make the love stoty sentimental and tragic. Let me ask you a question. Near the end, Jin-Ha seems to have everything. Sullie is alive and still loves him passionately. The kid (also played younger Jin-Ha) accepts him and wants to apprentice under him. His mercenary assassins are still loyal, willing to die for him. He killed all of his enemies except one. Sullie's brother supports their love. And guess what he wants to do? He wants to find a place to die! Why? Maybe his brain was too damaged from poison to think rationally.
Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed this movie tremendously and the love story moved me. The last scene was haunting and unforgettable with very little dialogue. However, it was as if the director decided to end the movie tragically no matter what and forgot to provide a compelling reason that could've made the movie more enjoyable. Sometimes, the less, the better. The more subtle, the more meaningful and moving. (The ending of Monster's Ball, for example)
If you prefer driving GTO to modern BMW, this movie will provide great entertainment for 2 hours. Enjoy.",1024358400,3,1600,4.843065693430657
1625446,5,B00005MEVV,"As an avid fan of traditional fantasy martial arts films, Bichunmoo is among the top movies within its category, ranking right next to Swordsman II, and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  Beautiful directing, coupled with the highest budget film in Korean movie-making history makes this a MUST see!  Unlike movies with much bang but mediocre plot (such as Storm Riders, The Duel, Legend of Zu), Bichunmoo explores a captivating love story between a poor swordsman, and the daughter of a powerful general.  The director is bold in his telling of this tragic love story, leaving the audience touched, and wishing for a happier alternative ending (as is the case of all good tragedies).

7945402,4,B00005MEVV,"It's funny, the first thought I had after the movie was over wasn't how good or bad it was, or how much I liked it or what my favorite part was. No, my initial impression was just how ""watchable"" it was. Bichunmoo is a film I feel like I could watch no matter what kind of mood I was in. Some films, regardless of how great they are, require a certain mood to be viewed. Not this one, though.

For its part, ""Bichunmoo"" is an excellent movie. It comes to us courtesy of the director of ""Shadowless Sword"". Personally, I liked SS, but this film is far superior to it. Let's dig into it.

Okay, quick premise. Guy loves girl. Girl forced to marry another. Guy gets his undies in a bunch and goes postal with his sword. Yeah, there's far more nuance to it, but you get the idea. The story really does play out nicely. The dialogue is kept to a minimum and the story is told through reactions and expressions and the sweeping score that really is a nice addition. The acting is solid from a very familiar cast (if you watch enough Korean action). The only thing that threw me is that the film pulls a Beowulf in the middle and jumps ahead a decade or so with very little warning. But once your brain catches up, you'll get it.

That leaves us with the action. First off, this movie isn't short on action. There are plenty of sword and fist fights to please any action junkie. What I found interesting is that the action is shot in a very Hong Kong style. It uses the dynamic handheld technique that Tsui Hark has spent a lifetime perfecting, and it does it well. I would say the action in this film most resembles Hark's ""The Blade"". Not much is slown down. It comes fast and furious with some wire and acrobatics to accent, but never dominate, the action.

The hand held isn't the ""shaky"" US style that obscures the action so that we don't see how poor our stunt men here our. It's steady and tends to rock left and right or up and down to catch the movement. It adds a certain intensity and brutality that no steadicam or dolly or jib arm can match. Being a huge Hark fan it's one of my all-time favorite ways to capture a fight scene and it's done here masterfully.

That's all I have to say on that. More than passable story. Capable and solid acting. All topped off with a generous quantity and top-notch quality fight scenes and visual style that are world class. A definite must-see.",1221350400,3,2386,4.305122494432071
7945403,3,B00005MEVV,A good (Korean) martial arts movie.  I recommend it - if you can get it at a good price.  Four stars!,1170547200,,101,3.761904761904762
7945404,2,B00005MEVV,"This sucked in everyway possible the storyline is horrible and its incredibly CONFUSING characters pop in and out, and this movie looks like a low budget film from the early 90s a few guys carry plastic swords and if you pay close attention you can notice the wires on two or three occasions so much for claiming to be the highest budget korean film.

i bought this movie thinking that it was a smart, stylish love story but don't let the nice dvd cover fool you this movie is mostly bad fighting the bodies explode after getting sliced, so ridiculous. This movie is perfect for teenagers or if you just want a mindless action film, if you want a good korean movie then buy ""musa:the warrior"" instead.",1159833600,,701,4.519685039370079
7945405,2,B00005MEVV,"""Just skip foward to the fightin scenes"" - you might be telling yourself this when you try to watch this movie again and again. Only the fighting scenes makes this movie come alive- the main character has a style of slicing multiple enemies from a distance(and the enemies don't really get sliced, they just have smoke & dust exploding from their torsos). You may like this film if you enjoyed the movie, DEADFUL MELODY, because it has a simple plot,poor dialog, poorly-executed story, yet dazzling fighting scenes. But DEADFUL MELODY makes this film look like a amateur/student film.

And if you like CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON, HERO, and HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS, don't get this movie! BICHUNMOO has a decent romance story in it but it is not well executed as these movies.",1126224000,8,777,4.842105263157895
