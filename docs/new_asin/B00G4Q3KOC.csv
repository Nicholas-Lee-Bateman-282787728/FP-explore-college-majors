6056938,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"Solomon Northrup ( Chiwetel Ejiofor) a free black man living in Saratoga, NY is conned into coming to Washington DC where he is taken captive and forced into slavery as part of a slave ring. The film, based on the book, shows the humiliating life Solomon had to endure as ""nothing but prized life stock."" In spite of his skills and education he could not secure himself a position away from hard labor.

The film depicts graphic beatings, plantation owners infidelity with the slaves, and or course white racist slave owners in a bad light. In a minor role, Paul Giamatti plays a slave trader and Brad Pitt a Canadian abolitionist living in the south.

There is some singing in the film, the roots of spiritual gospel and the blues. It is clear that singing was done to maintain sanity and purpose in a hopeless situation.

The acting was superb. The film is emotional. The only fault is that the title gives away the whole plot and ending which unfortunately was slightly anti-climatic ...funny how real life sometimes does that.

Well worth seeing.

6056939,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"Let's get this out of the way first: Chiwetel Ejiofor is pronounced ""Chew-eh-tell Edge-ee-oh-for."" You will hear it many times during the awards season.

Based on his book written in 1854, this best seller told how Solomon Northup, born a free (educated) black man in New York, was abducted in Washington DC, sold into slavery and his travails that followed. For one thing, he had to conceal his literacy or be killed. The screenplay is by John Ridley (""Red Tails""), with the much-acclaimed Steve McQueen (""Shame"") as director.

We have always heard that power corrupts. I would argue that it's the ABUSE of power that is so corrosive, not the power itself. In my opinion, that is what is illustrated here.

Look at the cast:
  * Chiwetel Ejiofor (""Salt"") is brilliant as Solomon Northup, the fellow whose misfortunes we must watch. This actor, born in England to Nigerian parents, is a terrific chameleon, a master of dialects, and a clever fellow who sang ""These Boots are Made for Walkin' "" as a fetching drag queen in ""Kinky Boots."" I'm a big fan.
  * Lupita Nyong'o (some TV) is Patsey, a fellow slave, subjected to every demeaning scheme her cruel owners can devise.
  * Quvenzhan Wallis (""Beasts of the Southern Wild"") is Northup's daughter Margaret. Her name is pronounced ""Qua-ven-zhah-nay.""
  * Michael Fassbender (""Prometheus"") is excellent as Edwin Epps, a slave owner. He illustrates the dehumanizing effects that slavery has on both slaves and their owners. This German-born actor has worked non stop in America in both movies and television since he first appeared in 2001.
  * Sarah Paulson (Lots of TV) is his wife, who is every bit as cruel in her own sweet genteel way as her loathsome husband.

This has a huge cast, and we see an interesting series of cameos which feature Brad Pitt, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Giamatti, Alfre Woodard, and Paul Dano, to name a few.

This is 134 loooong R-rated minutes, with only two teeny scraps of humor, some nudity and far too many bloody whippings. I reached horror overload about halfway in: I saw enough lashings, beatings, hangings, rapes and humiliations to last me a lifetime.

This movie is very capably done, both Fassbender and Ejiofor should be short-listed for Academy nominations, but the script itself was a bit of overkill. Sometimes too much brutality is just too much, the audience gets numb. Be warned.... Amazon will advise me when the DVD is available for my JayFlix.net folks.",1383782400,5,2455,4.893719806763285
6056940,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"Sometimes movies need to be made to awaken people's sense of justice.  12 Years a Slave has a similar role in doing that to Schindler's List, other than that Schindler's List also was about the power of one individual to make a difference.  12 Years a Slave is very, very realistic in presenting the life of slaves, but is equally conscientious about not being overindulgent in it.  The director, Steve McQueen (no relation to the 1960s actor), was discreet (tried to neither underdo nor overdo) with depicting the naked humiliation and floggings, didn't explicitly show the sexual molestation by a cruel master of a young slave woman, and often chose to show disturbing things from some distance and without total clarity.  Close-ups of brutality were done with the minimum of gore necessary to depict the reality.  Sadly, many people today believe slavery was only a side issue in the Civil War, and I hope and pray this film will wake people up to the historical reality.  If we wish to avoid future catastrophes like the Civil War and World War II, we need to be very careful to not allow our societies to get used to cruelty like was done to slaves and to Jews.  The three moral flaws of both the southern slaveholding system and the Nazi Third Reich were their racism, their overemphasis on submission to authority without regarding themselves as accountable to God for how they treated those under them, and their hierarchical system which had no accountability.  The slaveholder was accountable to no one, nor was Hitler.  I hope that this film helps more people realize that any government without an accountability system is a recipe for disaster, and that they will be more active in grassroots activism for that reason.

Just before seeing 12 Years a Slave, I saw the new movie All Is Lost that has Robert Redford trying to survive alone at sea.  I mention All Is Lost to make the point that 12 Years a Slave gets its strong sense of justice from its acknowledgment that there is a God of justice.  In both movies, the character is trapped and without any reasonable hope, though he keeps trying to escape his predicament.  I think this one's a lot better.  All Is Lost was about self-reliance against the forces of nature, and really nothing more.  God was either distant or nonexistent, and the movie ended without any acknowledgment that the last-minute rescue was God's intervention.  12 Years a Slave insists that there is a God of justice and that He will ultimately not allow this system of brutal slavery to continue.  It serves as a reminder of a horrible past, but is made even more timeless because it places the focus of the moral struggle on who God is.  The slaveowner believes God is all about subservience.  The slave believes God is about kindness and supporting the cause of those who are cruelly persecuted.  There is some good discussion toward the end about God's justice in Brad Pitt's small but memorable role.  The movie could have used a bit more, but what it has is sufficient.  Pitt's character helps our hero, Solomon Northup, regain his freedom.  Brad Pitt was a producer for the film.

The acting is excellent in the movie.  The script has dialogue that I can believe would have really been used, and usually comes off sounding like it's authentic instead of like a theatrical performance, which is good.  The movie does very well stylistically at presenting the atmosphere in a realistic but also beautiful way.  It was filmed in Louisiana and has carefully conceived outdoor shots, realistically lit interior shots that still feel artistic, and a stunning reminder of the disgusting contrast between the plantation mansion and the outdoor hard work of the slave.  It made me realize, even more than I already did, how much simpler it would be if the slaveholders just treated their slaves with respect, paid them well, let them work for whomever they chose, and let them climb the ladder through hard work.  Instead, it's a daily power play, an internal struggle within the overseer and master as to how much torture the slave should get, and a constant fear that the slave will rebel.

If anyone thinks he/she could handle watching two pretty brutal flogging scenes, three scenes of discreetly presented naked humiliation, and human relationships between slave and master that are harshly realistic, I recommend this.  It's not something you ""must"" see if you don't have the stomach for it.  But it's a monumental movie and probably will become the best movie showing the reality of slave life.  It goes neither too light nor too heavy in depicting the reality, in my estimation, and will hopefully make many people more attuned to justice and willing to fight against injustice.",1383609600,14,4724,4.8213399503722085
6056941,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"McQueen was an art student before he became a filmmaker and while watching this film you can detect the influence of Brueghel and Goya (esp in the hanging sequence which is the most visually arresting of the entire film). And you can also detect the art school influence in the way he films groups of slaves standing still and looking straight into camera as if standing for a portrait. These moments are arresting and draw attention to the film as art object but also foreground the way faces in paintings seem to be looking at us, asking for compassion, asking not to be forgotten. But those art film flourishes aside this is not an art film, but in many ways an Old Hollywood drama with loads of Oscar appeal for three reasons. 1) McQueen is known for long takes and in this film the camera lingers on what it shows far longer than any other filmmaker has lingered on images of slavery especially of prolonged scenes of torture including lashings and rape. 2) McQueen digs much deeper into the psychologies of both the slaves and slavemasters than any previous filmmaker. Fassbender's performance is especially memorable. The role illustrates the depths of depravity (and soul-twisting rationalizations) required to participate in such a vile practice. His Edwin Epps is a man who cannot feel like a man unless he dominates others but the more he dominates (or tries to) the less of a man he becomes. Its a fascinating role and performance. Chiwetel Ejiofor's performance is equally memorable but in a completely different way. Fassbender's performance is manic and over the top and Ejiofor's is subdued, understated because that is the only way his Solomon Northup can survive his 12 year long ordeal. 3)  McQueen provides us with glimpes of a wide array of strategies employed by both slaves to endure and slave masters to justify this practice, this inhumane chapter in history. The most moving moment of the film is the moment the slaves all join together to sing ""Roll Jordan Roll"" while standing in a graveyard. In this moment they are no longer individuals (no individual can bear the burden they have been forced to bear alone) but a collective all leaning on each other and on God to see them through and to temporarily transform their pain and suffering into something beautiful, something life-affirming and soul-sustaining. But we also see other kinds of slaves who endured in other ways. One of the most memorable of these is played by Alfre Woodard who portrays a slave who uses her feminine wiles to become the wife of a slavemaster. Its a small role, just a few minutes of screen time, but its a few moments that remain etched in memory----this women has survived and will continue to survive only so long as she can veil her true self. And this performance is juxtaposed with Lupito Nyongo's even more memorable and movong performance as ""Patsey,"" a slave who cannot and will not veil her true self for anyone. Equally important (although less emotionally impactful) McQueen shows us that not all of the slaveowners were vile creatures like Epps but how even otherwise decent men owned slaves and justified this practice to themselves (at least one of the actors is quoted as saying he found these types to be even more vile than Epps because they knew better). Benedict Cumberbatch's ""Ford"" is one of these otherwise decent men who knew better but nonetheless did nothing to stop this horrific practice. And he is balanced by a decent man played by Brad Pitt who did do something about it.",1383609600,8,3510,4.801652892561983
6056942,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.

It is unlikely anyone who goes to see this film won't have some idea about what it's about.  There have been many fine films about slavery.  And while 2012's ""Django Unchained"" certainly has violent elements associated with American slavery, that film and others often remind you that it's only a movie.  This movie will draw you in and does so with the unique history of Solomon Northup, an actual freeman who lived a good life in Saratoga, New York.  In 1841, he had a beautiful wife and 2 children (one played by Oscar nominee Quvenshane Wallis).  He was a classical violinist and highly respected in the community.

Approached by a pair of ""gentlemen"" (including a couldn't-believe-my-eyes Taran Killam from ""Saturday Night Live"") Solomon (an amazing Chiwetel Ejiofor) is enticed by a financial offer to play a gig in Washington, D. C.  Once there, he is kidnapped, shackled and sent by steamer to New Orleans.  Upon his arrival he is sold as an escaped slave.  During this first act, Solomon must quickly learn how to behave, how to act.  Just to stay alive.  Even talking is frowned upon, so Ejiofor must speak to the audience with his eyes and his expressions to project the torment he is experiencing.  Director Steve McQueen often focuses the camera on faces to bring out the pain of the oppressed as well as the viciousness of the oppressors.  McQueen doesn't shy away from anything so be prepared.

Slaves, both men and women, are herded together like cattle.  They are stripped, hosed down and sold naked.  It is hard to watch.  Even harder, mothers and children are separated.  This is gut-wrenching story telling.  Solomon, now called Platt, must hold it together, keeping his wits so that he can eventually reunite with his family.  Solomon is first sold to Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), a man of some benevolence as slave owners go.  He gives Solomon a violin.  He is relatively kind.  He is portrayed as a man who is uncomfortable with his position but must accept his role as master.  When Ford's cotton crop is infested with disease, he must transfer ownership of some of his slaves and does so to Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender in another great performance).

Epps is a polar opposite to the meek-mannered Ford.  He is vicious and violently sadistic.  As noted above, McQueen and his photographer bring out the evil in Fassbender's performance.  Epps is not only focused on teaching Solomon a lesson, he always has eyes for a slave known as Patsey (newcomer Lupita Nyong'o).  She is but a wisp of a woman but always picks more cotton than any of the men.  She is regularly raped by Epps, to the point he doesn't even hide it from his wife (Sarah Paulson).  This means that Patsey not only receives harsh treatment from Edwin but from his wife in equal measure.  Solomon does his best to comfort Patsey, but has his own agenda.

In one sequence Solomon trusts a white slave (who knew?), under Edwin's control to work off a debt, with the promise to mail a letter back to his family.  The man is paid what few coins Solomon had and upon his release promises to mail the yet to be written letter.  Instead, he rats out Solomon to Epps.  When confronted, a tired Solomon must quickly formulate a lie.  Looking Epps directly in the eye, Solomon without a quiver, delivers a believable story without hesitation.  Remarkable stuff.

Remember what I said about ""it's only a movie?""  There is one shattering scene where Solomon is forced by Epps to whip the stripped Patsey as punishment for her wandering off to a nearby plantation.  And for a while, as uncomfortable as it is to watch, we only see the pain in Solomon's face as he lashes Patsey.  OK, enough already right?  Instead, McQueen swivels his camera around the tree to see the peeled and scarred back of the woman as the whip tears off her skin.  This is tear-inducing filmmaking on many levels, but this scene induced many gasps from the audience and a couple walk-outs.

But McQueen and screenwriter John Ridley want audiences to see the evil and feel the pain in the film.  And boy do they succeed.  I would be remiss if I didn't talk about some of the technical elements of the film.  During some of the difficult scenes rather than averting my eyes, I was able to focus briefly on some of the great photography in the film.  As unusual and contradictory as it may seem, ""12 Years"" is technically masterful.  The soft glow of the cotton fields, the hazy setting of the sun, the insect spreading its wings, somehow add a respite of civility to this great film of a disgraceful American past.  Look for Oscar nomination for actors Ejiofor, Fassbender and Nyong'o, director McQueen and more.",1383523200,188,4708,4.712883435582822
6056943,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"""12 Years A Slave"" (2013 release; 134 min.) brings to the big screen the book written by Solomon Northup in 1853, to tell the world of his ordeal as a slave in the deep South after having been abducted. As the movie opens, we go back-and-forth between scene of Northup with his family in Saratoga, New York and Northup on a plantation camp. We are not even 15 min. into the movie when Northup, having been deceived by a couple of artists into coming to Washington DC with them, is abducted and eventually sold into slavery. Another slave gives him a piece of advice on how to survive (:keep your head low""), to which Northup responds ""I don't want to survive, I want to LIVE!"". To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this movie is directed by Steve McQueen, who previously brought us the equally excellent ""Hunger"" (from 2008) and ""Shame"" (from 2011). The latter was the at times shocking sex-addiction drama starring Michael Fassbender, and Fassbender is of course also one of the main actors in ""12 Years"" (more on that later). Second, this movie will likely shock you, as it certainly did me. There are many unsettling scenes, with extensive violence including multiple beatings, hangings, and whip-lashings. If it is done to make the movie as authentic as possible, then there is no argument against including these scenes. But it also makes clear that this movie is rated R for a reason. (I would not recommend that anyone younger than 14 or 15 watch this movie.) Third, the acting performances are stellar throughout the movie, none more so than Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup. Surely he will get a Best Actor Oscar nomination for this masterful performance. There are tons of other choice roles, including the already mention Fassbender as the cruel plantation owner, but also Adepero Oduye as fellow slave Eliza. At one point Eliza gets separated from her 2 children and just falls apart, to which the plantation wife responds ""your children will soon be forgotten"" (there was a huge groan from the theatre audience then) Keep your eyes open for a cameo from Brad Pitt (less than 5 min. of screen time), Pitt's production company Plan B played a significant role in bringing this movie to the big screen. At the very end of the movie, we are informed what became of Northup after the publication of the 1853 book, as well as what became of his abductors.

This movie has been playing in a few select cities the last 2-3 weeks and finally was rolled out to more cities this week. It opened in Cincinnati and I went to see it right away. The late matinee screening I saw this at was very well attended, which is great news as this movie deserves to be seen both for its historical context as well as for the top quality movie that it is. If it wasn't clear by now, and assuming you can deal with the multiple violent scenes, ""12 Years A Slave"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1383436800,11,2990,4.618421052631579

Since it's October release, this film quickly left it's bloody scare on the topic, and whether or not you connect with director Steve McQueens aesthetic, one cannot simply ignore ""12 Years A Slave"" due to its sheer menace and despair. While Steven Spielbergs Amistad (1997) was a graphic depiction of slavery as well, it still bears his auteur penmanship of guiding the audience to ultimately partake in the triumph of the human spirit. 12 Years A Slave, even in its finale, refuses simplistic bliss and steadfastly remains solemn.",1514419200,,864,5.048951048951049

While some of the scenes of punishment seemed graphic, the acting lacked the true intensity of the scourge of slavery but also the desperation and injustice felt by the main character.  Many details in the book were left out or were condensed to the point of making it seem like the movie just touched on the high points instead of telling the rich, full and tragic story of Solomon Northup's life.  The movie should have been narrated which could have filled in a lot of detail and explained all of the internal struggles Platt was agonizing over and the directing and editing may have been a detriment to the movie. Why didn't they ask Mel Gibson to direct? My recommendation is to rent or purchase the audiobook narrated by Lou Gossett which is a hundred times more captivating.",1506643200,2,881,4.670967741935484

Please, please read the wonderful masterpiece that is the book and watch this movie only to get some idea of what the South looks like, the cotton plantations and sugar cane fields. Where the book is full of excitement, suspence, life stories, the movie falls flat and is empty, silent, slow...boring. The movie is not even true to life when it portrays how slaves worked in the fields (and there's no excuse for it since the author took time to explain it in detail).

I couldn't help wishing many a times that a superhero would pop up and wipeout the execrable slave owners but of course nothing like that ever happened in reality or in the movie. Doesn't whitewash (pun fully intended) the reality of what the situation truly might have been and portrays the slave owners for what they were - vicious, soul-less and godless inhuman profiteers; the contrast from the holiness they purport to embrace in their lives while sermonizing and the reality of what they are inflicting on the slaves is truly ghastly.

6057154,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"12 Years a Slave tells the true story of Solomon Northup, an educated and free black man living in New York during the 1840's who gets abducted, shipped to the south, and sold into slavery. It is a film that stimulates at both an emotional level and an intellectual one.

Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Solomon Northup. He's been a ""that guy"" actor for sometime  film-goers may know his face but not his name. After this film his name will be known. He gives, quite simply, the best performance from a leading actor since Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood. Because of his character's position as a slave he is usually unable to speak his mind unless he is prepared to be beaten. As a result Ejiofor is forced to utilize body language and his eyes, which become enormous pools of emotion to express himself to the audience. He's forced to endure terrible things, but he always maintains a certain dignity and nobility that makes his plight even more affecting. It's a performance of incredible subtlety that may leave you speechless and in complete awe.

Micheal Fassbender gives the best performance of his already extremely impressive career, even besting his previous high marks from the films Shame and Hunger (both directed by Steve McQueen, who also directed 12 Years a Slave). He plays Edwynn Epps, a vicious and demonic slaver and perhaps the most loathsome and disgusting character ever put on screen. If alive today, he'd likely be a drunk with severe anger management issues. By turns pathetic and terrifying, he embodies the ultimate nightmare of a deeply flawed man given absolute power over other human beings, and through that absolute power finds only madness, which drives him to deeper cruelty. He's always a menacing and malignant presence even when not on screen, as his slaves must always be aware and prepared for his seemingly random bouts of sadism.

Other actors give excellent performances as well. Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano, Benedict Cumberbatch, Sarah Paulson, Alfre Woodard are all great in relatively small roles. But in this film of titans it's the one you've probably never heard of who perhaps stands above them all. In her first role in a feature film, Lupita Nyong'o, playing the pretty young slave Patsey - the object of Edwynn Epps demented and horrifying affections and the emotional epicenter of the entire picture, gives one of the most devastating performances I have ever seen. A portrait of unbearable sadness, her character is a mirror image of Solomon. While Solomon is a man who refuses to break and give up the dignity which he's known since birth, she is one who has long since been broken, and who never knew dignity in the first place. Her life is a living hell, forced to endure the ""love"" of Edwyn Epps and the brutal jealousy of his wife, she's trapped in a terrible triangle that she can't escape. Despite that, she retains a level of innocence that only heightens the tragedy of her character. It actually gets to the point where simply looking at this character might be enough to bring you to tears. It's a shattering performance.

Starting his career as a video artist before making full length films, Steve McQueen has an uncanny eye for imagery and contrast. He's also a very patient film maker, utilizing long, steady single shots to emphasize various things. In his prior films this has felt like a purely stylistic choice, here, it's a choice aimed directly at our heart. When the events on screen become their most horrifying and ugly is when his camera becomes the most unflinching. At times feeling perhaps like we're seeing out of the solemn eyes of the ghost of some murdered slave, watching in sorrow and rage. This is both McQueen's most accessible and artistically searing film yet.

There are also moments of stunning natural beauty that would make Terrence Malick proud. Alone, these shots would inspire wonder, but in the context of this film they make us feel more forlorn, as if the ugliness of man is encroaching on the natural beauty of the world.

Perhaps the most noteworthy thing about 12 Years a Slave is the way that it portrays slavery itself. Instead of taking the easy way out and limiting his exploration of the topic solely to the slaves, Steve McQueen increases the scope and we see how it affects those who profited by it. Take Benedict Cumberbatch's character. A seemingly decent and caring man who treats his slaves with some semblance of respect and kindness. He comes off as a relatively good man who is trapped within the powerful confines of the institution of slavery. In 12 Years a Slave, slavery is shown as a horrifying and destructive social construct that drains the humanity from everyone it touches, turning good men into moral quandaries, turning flawed men into monsters, and turning an entire race of people into livestock and tools.

To watch 12 Years a Slave is to be confronted with the grim reality of slavery in a way that's never been done before. To say this is the best film ever made about slavery feels trivial, as slavery is a subject in film that has been shown with naive romanticism from films like Gone With the Wind or silly exploitation from something like Django Unchained. Both of which serve to make the topic digestible. To watch 12 Years a Slave is to experience a level of despair and misery that can become overwhelming. It's a film of such ugliness, such blunt emotional trauma, that it may haunt you for hours if not days after seeing it. So why should you watch a film that could leave you reeling and devastated? Because, it's also one of the greatest cinematic achievements of our time.",1475020800,,5618,4.778578784757982

6057168,1,B00G4Q3KOC,"What a great premise for a story. 12 Years a Slave, along with The Travels of Dean Mahomet, Equianos Travels and other slave memoirs of the late eighteenth and nineteenth century reached a high degree of popularity.  Today they are relegated to university reading lists in history colloquiums on slavery, colonialism, or in some aspect of minority studies where you would need to read self-portraits like this.

Because of their popularity, publishers of the time sought out these stories. Consequently there are a number of them out there but their authenticity remains suspect. Not so with 12 Years a Slave. A true story, corroborated by two PhD candidates in the 1960s concluded that the memoir was genuine.  Even now stories like these still hold emotional and political meaning for us here in the 21st century. The reasons for this are the following.

Black people have always had it rough in this country as they so often like to remind all the rest of us. Their story is unique in that most did not come here out of a desire or need for a better life.  Since they were forced under unusually arduous circumstances to serve as slaves for hundreds of years, there is a feeling in the black community that they have not received their rightful slice of the American dream.

Of course, how you came to be American is not really relevant on what you do once you are hereas long as you are free.

For over 150 years since the end of American slavery they have had the opportunity to rectify that situation, and have failed to do so. In the 20th century, other immigrant groups have continued to pass them by increasing their resentment, blaming racism, and not looking within their own community for answers. While others have found their places in American society, Asians, Indians, Jews and others who have done much better than the African Americans, these groups have become targets of black activists along with the white community who many in the black community blame for their failure. Is historical slavery the problem? Do they have a point? I don't know, you decide. This review is not the place for that discussion.

But, as emotionally stirring as a real American drama 12 years a Slave is, it unfortunately does not carry over to the film. There are major problems with it.

The story about a free black man living in Saratoga Springs, New York, is high jacked and taken surreptitiously back down south for sale on the slave market. 12 years original narrative written by Soloman Northrop, the subject of the story, was brought to the screen in 2013 by a number of producers who included Brad Pitt and Steve McQueen, (the black guy, not the white guy who played Bullitt. He died back in the 80s of cancer.) McQueen also directed which might explain the films failure to translate from the memoir to the screen.

The movie stars Chiwetel Ejiofor supported by Michael Fassbender, Lupita Nyongo, and Brad Pitt. Currently it cant be seen on the small screen for free, but you can rent it from Amazon or buy it on DVD.

Ejiofor is an excellent actor but was only mediocre in this film. You would expect someone with his talent to be able to run away with a role like that. But, it didn't happen. He seemed to walk through his scenes, say his lines and go home.

Lupita Nyongos over the top performance at McQueens direction was simply embarrassing. Every time she screamed and cried it was like running your fingernails on a blackboard. Another ten minutes of that I would have puked right there in my living room. Fassbenders portrayal of Edwin Epps the slave owner made me laugh rather than anger at his cruelty. He should have been an ugly figure radiating hate from the audience instead he came off like a comic book caricature of something evil, like a super hero villain. It was hard to watch.

Nevertheless, the film was recognized by the industry as being the best movie of that year. Being that the Academy is filled with bleeding hearts one has to believe that their motives for giving the film its most coveted awards, best picture, best director, best actor, and best supporting performance from an actress for Nyongo had to have been based on the memoir itself and not the film.

Maybe those cowards in Hollywood were afraid of the bullying and intimidation by American black activists if they did not recognize the achievement. One only has to look at Will and Jada Pinket Smiths campaign this past year to condemn the awards for not nominating any black artists for 2015, to understand the pressure and coercion from the black community and the academys reaction to their allegations.  Perhaps in the future we will be giving Academy Awards based on affirmative action rather than merit.

Ejiofor has done a half dozen roles where he could have competed for best actor and won. I have always enjoyed his work until this film. Njongo has since done TV and some other work where her acting reached an excellence expected of professional actors.  And, Fassbender has a long list of credits much more worthy than his work in this film. So I have to believe that 12 years failure was mostly due to McQueens direction.

An American drama about one of the more disgraceful parts of our history, McQueen did more than just give us a bad film. He had a chance to really set a high mark for films in Hollywood with this work and just failed on every level.

In addition he did not maintain the integrity and grant the reverence for the memoir that provided the world with this history.  Rather, he tended to veer off of the actual narrative and built a fictitious story around it for effect. like the opening scene where Northrop is having sex with a woman who is not his wife. The real Northrop probably would have been outraged that his image was used in such a manner to be unfaithful to his wife. I would submit there is no need to embellish a true story about the brutality of American slavery. Northrops memoir was quite clear on the viciousness and cruelty of his time in captivity.

Its too bad that McQueens work on this film was so poor. I would like to say that this film should be remembered by America the way Germany should remember Schindlers List, but unfortunately the movie so badly damaged the real story that it is just not possible. I would suggest reading the actual memoir for that reason. You just cant trust Hollywood to get it right.",1473552000,8,6373,4.647111111111111

6057176,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"When five stars on Amazon is supposed to mean ""I love it"" my first tendency is to give it something less, simply because much of this film is very painful to watch, and watching something so painful is not something I love.  Movies about slavery, war, and any kind of grave injustice, especially when presented in a very realistic light can be emotionally overwhelming, to the point where the impact on the audience detracts from the message.  My partner said he had to leave the room during the scenes of brutality (and he didn't come back).  I remember watching The Battle of Algiers in college and thinking the saving grace during one of the more horrific scenes of military torture was that it was presented without sound - that is, instead of hearing the torture we heard religious music (Bach?) acting as a kind of spiritual supplication for our humanity, a contrast of light against a background of cruel darkness.  At times director Steve McQueen does something similar in this film, with long shots of serene nature interspersed between the horrors we witness.  The problem in depicting such horrors without making people leave the theater (or living room) is to offer simultaneously a sense of humanity and possible salvation.  There were times during the more brutal scenes in this film when I think more could have been done in that regard simply as a way to keep some viewers from covering their eyes.  Fortunately, in the case of Solomon Northup, there was a happy ending to the horrors he endured, although McQueen makes us realize his case  was an exception and those left behind continued to suffer.  Reading the original autobiographical account (available free online at various internet archives), I discovered another thing that might have made the ending more powerful, which in the film is highly condensed to Northup being rescued and reunited with his family.  In his book, Northup himself relates an incredible series of good fortune, accidents, and near misses that were involved when those charged with rescuing him had to go into a wild area of immense size with many plantations and with few clues to help them.  That part of his story was truly amazing, and would have made for a really suspenseful ending to the film.",1472515200,,2249,4.861256544502618

6057184,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"While most movies about slaves in the Antebellum south focus on people who were either born into slavery or were abducted from Africa and brought to the New World against their will, the present film has a different story.  Solomon was a freeman living in New York who was kidnapped and taken to the deep south (Louisiana) to work on a plantation.  Living in a time where southerners tended not to care about where black people came from, he had no legal recourse to challenge the white men who illegally snatched him away from his family & his life.

Unlike movies with a happy-go-lucky image of slavery such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gone-with-the-Wind-Two-Disc-70th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B002M2Z3BA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gone with the Wind (Two Disc 70th Anniversary Edition)</a>, the present film offers an unvarnished, disturbing and (sadly) accurate depiction of the horrors of the south until the end of the civil war.  It is a story of how little regard people had for the lives of African Americans.

Sadly, > 150 years after the end of the civil war, the issues presented in this story still haunt us.  Unfortunately, Donald Trump has tapped into the hatred of far right wing groups such as the Neo Nazis and we are in danger of taking a rather large step backwards in race relations.  The present film is a reminder of just how ugly the world was that we left back in 1865......we cannot afford to go back there.",1471219200,,1481,5.197478991596639

6057187,2,B00G4Q3KOC,"Yes. Slavery was, still is, just debasement. What I am tired of is Hollywood rehashing what we already know. Europeans, realising the evils, worked hard to abolish slavery. I'd love to see more films along this line. Instead we have a small l liberal version of what we know and acknowledged so long ago. It would be great to see a film on modern day chocolate slavery, the stealing of children, by cultures other than Western which got its house in order. Lawrence of Arabia tells of slavery in Arabia in the early 20th century. Can we have a film on that? And in other present day cultures. I am tired of ""whites"" today being beaten up for crimes they abolished by law, long ago. Yes, this man's story is awful.  Let's get over it and address contemporary issues.

6057253,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"A true story based on a book written by Solomon Northup on his harrowing personal experience. Northup (convincingly portrayed by Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a black freeman living in New York who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. After he accepted  a job as a fiddler in a business venture of two men, he was kidnapped and sold as a slave in the mid-19th century South. His fortitude and will to survive helped him endure years in bondage despite of the extreme cruelty and unimaginable hardships that he and the other slaves suffered in the hands of their master. Ejiofor, together with supporting actors Michael Fassbender and Lupita Nyong'o are true gems in this period drama. While watching the blu-ray, I can't help but admire the production design; the props and set pieces used were constructed after a meticulous research to help the actors and director make the story come alive and recreate the feel and look of pre-Civil War America (incidentally, Adam Stockhausen, the man behind the design won an Oscar for 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' and earned a similar nomination for 'Bridge of Spies').

6057264,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"Based on a true story about Solomon Northup that began in 1841. Solomon was an accomplished violinist from Saratoga, New York, who went on a two-week tour with a circus to Washington, leaving behind his wife and young daughter and son. In Washington, he was kidnapped and forced into slavery for 12 years, working along side other slaves on a plantation picking cotton. When quotas that each slave pick a minimum of 200-pounds per day are not met, the punishment was a brutal whip lashing. The redeeming quality of the film was when a white carpenter named Bass (Brad Pitt) was hired by the plantation owner, Edwin Epps. Bass worked with slave Solomon to construct a shed or building on the property. Bass confronted Master Epps in a heated exchange about the horrid working conditions the slaves had to endure. Solomon, feeling a comradery with Bass, privately told him his true identity and about his abduction. Bass, astounded, proved to be a towering figure of uncompromising integrity when he informed authorities. The sheriff accompanied by a lawyer arrived on the plantation and requested that Master Epps release Solomon under court order. What was wrenching was that Solomon couldn't take Patsey (Lupita Wyong'o), his closest confidant, with him. The role put Lupita on the map when she won Best Supporting Actress Oscar.",1462233600,4,1330,5.02262443438914

6057277,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"Great movie in pre-civil war days.  This is based on a true story of a free black man who lived in the north,  He was abducted and sold into slavery. During the many years he spent in bondage in the south, he never gave up on returning to his wife and children in the north, and his freedom. The movie gives insight to the abuse the black people received at the hands of the southern plantation owners.  It is very graphic and some scenes are not appropriate for all audiences.  Watching the movie was part of a class assignment, but I have to say that I'm glad I purchased it so I can watch it again. The cast is phenomenal. I would recommend watching this movie.  It helps keep America real, the stuff you don't get In your typical history class.",1461196800,2,748,4.276595744680851

6057283,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"Imagine going through a normal day in life with no problems. Having an almost picture perfect week, advancing in your career and even spending quality time with your family. Now imagine being seized by people who say you are unequal as them and are now enslaved for the remainder of your lifetime. This was the reality for many including a man named Solomon Northup. This man was captured and enslaved for 12 years. Unlike the others who were enslaved for generations, even centuries, Solomon Northup was able to escape the horrific and brutal enslavement after 12 years.
 The name of this movie is 12 Years a Slave. It was directed by a man named Steve McQueen in 2013. The screenplay was by John Ridley. Interestingly enough, the producer was Brad Pitt who played a crucial role in the film by helping Solomon Northup break free from captivity. The IMDb rating for this movie was 8.1/10. In my opinion the movie deserves a 10/10. It was phenomenal, in other words it was well developed. This movie does not hold back on explicit images. The main characters are Solomon Northup played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, Patsey played by Lupita Nyongo, Ford played by Benedict Cumberbatch, Epps played by Michael Fassbender, and finally Bass played by Brad Pitt. These actors played major roles in the movie. Their characters impacted the movie in  powerful ways. They demonstrated all types of people present in that time: the extremists, the enslaved, the radical, and all sorts of people were depicted in the movie. They represented individuals that were present during that period and even ones that exist today. In the movie, characters like Solomon Northup and Patsey played roles of bought slaves. They were either born into enslavement or kidnapped and sold as Solomon was. After being sold, they were treated as animals. They worked day to night until death or being beaten to it. What is distinctive about this story as opposed to the others is that Solomon was rescued. He did not escape, he was freed with legitimate documents stating he had always been a free man.
 Solomon Northup was a respectable man from New York. He was born in 1808 and grew up as a free man. He later had his own family and worked as a violinist. One day after going on a business trip in the South, he became ill. After some time, he woke up, however he wasn't the same after that day. He was no longer a free man but a slave. He became a slave for 12 years unlike the lifetimes other slaves go though. He endured two owners; one kind and one cruel. Solomon saw things he was never even aware of as a free man. He experienced inequality to its full capacity, whippings and even saw lynchings. As an enslaved being, he experienced racism to its full potential. At times Solomon was beaten and whipped brutally as well as the other slaves were. Despite the constant maltreatment, Solomons first owner was kind and did not abuse his power or authority. He did meet a few good people who were kind and not full of malice.
 In the movie, Solomon meets a woman named Patsey. She is also a slave to their cruel owner. Patsey is unique because she is the best worker in the field, better than any man. She is favored by their owner, Epps. In result of this, Epps wife, Mary is jealous and hateful towards Patsey. She becomes angry and violent towards Patsey. She even knows to a certain extent that her husband has even had sexual relations with Patsey which in fact was rape. On one occasion, Epps wakes up the slaves for a midnight singing. As the slaves forcibly sang and danced, Patsey was not as cheerful after being raped. Mary Epps decides to throw a glass decanter at her face to lighten up her mood. The abuse did not stop with man but also continued with woman. Mary Epps was not a kind woman. She was hateful, bitter and negative just as her husband. She was also jealous of Patsey for the affection Epps displayed towards her. The reality of it was that Patsey did not want to live. She did not want to live as a slave. She did not want to live as a human being trapped. Mary Epps was jealous of her and physically hurt her just as her husband did and she did not ask or want any of it. She did not want Epps raping her or Mary hurting her further more because of it. She in fact just wanted to be dead which is what she asked Solomon to do. Her misery led her to ask Solomon to kill her as a favor. She pleaded and begged. However, Solomon would not dare to do so. He understood the consequences and the pain he would suffer in doing so. Killing Patsey could have had many possible outcomes and aside that Solomon did not have the audacity or courage to do so. Instead Solomon asked how dare one say or even think those things. Solomon of course declined the idea of such a thing especially to be committed by him, no matter how much she pleaded. Their friendship was deep and trusting however Solomon was not ever willing to commit such an act. Solomon may not have been willing to put her out of her misery however he did protect and care for her in ways that others may never had the effort to do. He even took whippings for this woman. Their friendship was emotional and loving considering their circumstances.
 This movie in my opinion was powerful. It went into history and touched on topics and terms we do not discuss often enough. To have a visual of it is important. To actually see what were the kinds of things that occurred during that time was necessary. The people of 2016 do not see the extent of abuse of the 1800s where slavery was still present in the South which is where the movie takes place. This movie displays extremely graphic content that in fact happened at one point in time. For this reason I recommend this movie to adults or mature audiences. Things like lynchings which was common to do to slaves was shown in the movie. I absolutely loved the movie for not holding back scenes like this but displaying true history. It is important to understand ones history in order to know where one is going. I believe this to be completely true in this movie. The hate experienced in earlier times helps one understand where the hate from these present times stem from.",1460592000,,6170,4.500446030330062

It's one thing to know that people owned slaves in the US in the last 200 years, but it's another to see how slaves were actually treated.  Cartoon pictures of slaves in kids history books don't do much justice to the people who endured slavery.  I think this movie (and some similar movies) may give more meaning to the words 'slave' and 'slavery' to those whom may otherwise not think of this time in our nations past as as significant as it was.",1456963200,,617,4.37719298245614

I'm a sucker for true crime and true stories in general and this one didn't disappoint. This movie shows the truth and the harsh labors attached to being a slave and what could happen even if you weren't a slave to begin with.

This movie follows a father and husband who's a black freeman from birth and has made a living and is kidnapped and sold into slavery. For the next 12 years he is captive and dealing with the many harsh realities that come with slavery. Luckily, in the end things change for him but not everyone is as lucky as he ended up being. It's a shame to know that this very well probably happened to many black people around this time. Free people who get kidnapped and sold into slavery It makes me sad to know that if I was born a few decades back It could have been me.

This is a movie that makes you think and feel and really appreciate what you have and where we are. Racism is still a big issue today but back then things where much worse in many ways. This is a movie I highly recommend to everyone to at least watch once in their life.",1453852800,,1234,4.05327868852459

6057404,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"A notion once persisted in this country that slavery was benign and that slave owners were often kind to human beings they held in bondage.

Steve McQueen does the same by bringing Solomon Northups recounting (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/12-Years-a-Slave/dp/1508483175/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">12 Years a Slave</a>) of his firsthand experience to the screen. Youll find the movie brutal because slavery was brutal.

McQueens cinematic choices, from the terrifying beginning when Solomon wakes to find himself ripped from his life as a musician and as a family man in upstate New York in a slave pen in Washington, D.C. to the slave auction showing the destruction of any semblance of family life among slaves, to his punishment at the hands of Edwin Epps by hanging in a stunning scene thats unforgettable because it portrays so forcefully the acceptance of brutality, and to the hard-to-watch whipping by Epps of his favorite slave Patsey, whom he also rapes regularly, a barely teenage girl at his mercy and caprice. Its a film filled with brutality because, as said, slavery was brutal.

Often forgotten, though, and vividly brought to life by McQueen is that slavery and the dehumanization of an entire race also forced slave holders into hypocritical rationalizations of their practices and into dehumanized beasts themselves. William Ford exemplifies the former and Epps and his wife Mary illustrate the latter, both of whom exhibit the most base emotions run unchecked and rampant beyond cruelty.

While many will find it a hard film to watch, its the very reason every American will benefit from watching it. Slavery is more than a stain on American history, the exact opposite of the ideals we strive for, and to which many of us, unfortunately, only pay lip service; it also goes a long way to explaining the economic and social plight of African Americans and the thinly submerged racism in the nation. The effects of such a peculiar institution don't vanish in a generation, or two or three, not even in what many like to call, either in misbelief or mockery, a post-racial America.",1452729600,,2827,6.1313131313131315

6057414,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"Chiwetel Ejiofor stars in this movie entitled,""12 Years A Slave"" as Solomon Northup, a New York State citizen who was kidnapped and made to work on a plantation as a slave in New Orleans in the 1800's. It was based on his memoir that has the same title of the movie and apparently it was stated that he worked for 12 years as a slave before he was released. This movie has been honored with numerous Oscar nominations that includes the screenplay written by John Ridley and its director Steve McQueen aside from that of Best Actor for Ejiofor and winning the Best Picture during the year it was released.

Solomon Northup is a free African-American man working as a violinist, who lives with his wife, Anne Hampton, and two children in Saratoga Springs, New York. But in 1841,he was two men, Brown and Hamilton, offer him a two-week job as a musician if he will travel to Washington, D.C., with them. Once there, they drugged him and sold him as a slave to New Orleans along with others who have been captured. A slave trader named Freeman gives Northup the identity of ""Platt"", a runaway slave from Georgia and sells him to plantation owner William Ford. The movie presents the evils of slavery and the experiences Northup had in the next 12 years until he was released and regained his freedom.

The film won the Best Picture as stated earlier in the review. It greatly deserves this honor as it marvelously and excellently provides a brutal look at the evils of slavery during its existence in American history. Also,it was unsentimental and it clearly portrays bluntly how slavery could affect an individual. This is a powerful and compelling that one would definitely appreciate as the viewer gets to see the horrific experiences of Northup and the other slaves during the 1800's. In summary,it provides credence and great cinema translation of Northup's memoir. It is a film that viewers of great movies that would surely enjoy.",1451088000,,1934,4.752976190476191

I cannot believe Mcqueen was able to remain elegant and honest telling it. it shows you the real side of slavery, and without gratuitous scenes, which I believe is its brightest achievement. How I could never imagine to put together. but they did it. Just beautiful.

I shared this with my history class:

I'm not sure what you want me to say: Slavery and Solomon Northups story

The truth is, what transpired for many years in America was wrong. Going over all of these stories changes nothing for me personally, because I was raised, not to be prejudice. Moreover, I was raised in such a way, that I had no idea the color of a man made him different. Later in my life I learned much of this, though I will agree, the truth has been a slow tell. I cannot grasp the idea of prejudice in my mind because I was raised this way.

When I look stories like this one, or Toni Morrison's ""Beloved,"" I get mad. Mostly, I get mad because the true culprits never pay. It is not white people who are guilty. And more often than not, innocent white people our victimized for this mistake.
It is the people in power, who do nothing, who are guilty of every death,  rape and horror done to the weak, and de-voiced. (My word,deal).
The powerful elite are to blame. Money and greed field most of this disgusting behavior, just as it was at the root of the trail of tears.
The day the common man sits in legislature, or government, and money no longer has any connection to the laws of the land. when limousines are unheard of with public servants.
This will be a day the black man, and woman can really stand up and breath free. Smile, and thank God.
The same powers that not only allowed, but created slavery, and murdered natives to take their land, are still in power today. They still cause death, and walk on the graves of slaves. They rape our land and extort the poor, while filling accounts overseas.
We must change this. You, our future, must listen to the warnings  go even further  until greed has no place in laws of the land.
People still suffer because they do not have the money to speak. Our criminal justice system is the new slave trade, and it is not only for the black man, but the poor man. More and more Americans are sent to prison each year, not because of guilt but because of lack of resources. Money is the dividing line between slave and master now, and with open eyes we can stop all of it if we work together.

Nothing has changed, only the packaging looks different. The same slave owners are in control. We need to dethrone them, and let the common man rule. This is our only chance to guarantee these slides are never again a reality.",1446336000,,3033,4.4078711985688726

The movie fails to capture and convey what Northup's writer wanted to convey about the conditions of that time. The movie's producer, it appears, decided to take a few snippets from the book and patch them together, being mindful that no glaring omission or mistake is made, but at the same time not going the extra mile in being sensitively depicting the hate and love between master and slave except for an explicit scene or two,  relationships between slaves, and among the white class itself in the South. In short, the movie is a gloss over of the real story, made perhaps for the drama and theatre effect that its producer and director imagined the viewing public would be sufficiently excited with  and so they will meet their goals, whatever they were. Had they attempted a more serious and deep effort it would have made an even better drama than it turned out to be.",1444348800,,1027,4.657458563535911

6057544,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"After reading an article about Texas's social studies textbook curriculum and how the text glossed over the horrors of slavery with rationalizations and under lying themes like "" Slavery wasn't ALL bad""...i found this movie especially meaningful. From the heart wrenching story of a successful American wrenched from his happy  life with his family to the pathetic unhappiness exuded from the white slaveowners ,there was no good in slavery except from the people who actively participated in abolishing it. I got more of a sense of how families were ripped apart, people dealt with guilt, anger festered ,and struggle for power was present within all society's hierarchy. For example, one poor white man ( recovering alcohalic) seemed to form a trusting bond with Soloman after he nursed Soloman's woinds and revealed his past and future goals to "" return to his home). Soloman gave him his savings of money as an offering to help him leave the Plantation cotton field work alongside the slaves in return for simply mailing a letter for Soloman to his family. Well, clearly the poor alcohalic white man working with slaves still considered himself above them because he took Soloman's money and told his owner about the letter. In other words, White Men, no matter how poor,unvirtuous or immoral ,still had more freedom than an educated skilled , family oriented man who just happened to be black.
The acting was incredible: Fassbender was convincing, Lupita is an artist in physique and in character, The actor playing Soloman let me into his character's soul. Instead of a Disneyfied social studies book a student would get a lot more out of watching this movie. It made me sad that such a powerful country founded on Great Ideas and Values would have ever been as uncivilized as to have encouraged this way of life. I am grateful it has ended legally,but we are still smarting from the after effects. We are paying for it even now in so many ways. I am thankful to have been able to watch this movie. Thank you, Mr. McQueen, for your impact.

6057549,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"Slavery.  This distinctly human invention has built empires, maintained economies and has allowed the destruction of empires and society.  Slavery has made it's appearance in every corner of the Earth in one form or another.  For some it has been brief while others it has lasted longer and some have changed a society; even affecting social and economic growth.  Throughout history, slavery has occurred in order to expand territories and governments, harvest natural resources and provide soldiers.  In some cases, slavery was so prevalent that there were more slaves than citizens referred to as masters.  This was the case with Ancient Rome and eventually led to their downfall.

 The North American continent was founded as a means to find freedom from persecution, religion and other parts of life that were not being fulfilled within an already established government.  Once a foothold was established in the beginning colonies it become apparent that in order to tame the land, provide a boost to the fledgling economy and defend themselves from the new dangers that the continent held; the ""Americans"" would need to establish a slave trade in the New World.

 This decision had the expected impact as there was an entire continent of available slaves that could be sent to America as part of an economic trade.  This would eventually make an entire half of a new nation completely dependent upon a property-based labor system.

 It is during this time period that the film, 12 Years a Slave takes place.  The events follow a free African American man who is abducted and sold into slavery and must find a way to persevere until his freedom is regained.  The American film industry has a history of producing movies that focus on the American Civil War, and other films that investigate the themes that are created in a situation such as the one described above.  The previously produced themes have focused on freed African Americans serving in the army without recognition, or brother fighting brother in the war and the brutality of the life of a slave.  Never has a film captured the raw cruelty, barbarism and natural crimes that had taken place during this period.

 In this film,  there is no salvation for these slaves.  Only moving from one slave owner to another do their terms of life change.  The cruelty and punishments that they endure simply as a consequence of living can be difficult to watch.  The shame and sorrow that the audience may feel during this film is undeniable.  The most important thing to take away from that can be taken away from the journey that one has to face during the course of this film is how the enduring legacy of America continues to this day and it is a legacy that has changed the world and continues to ruin people's lives no matter the culture.",1440374400,,2801,4.834033613445378

6057554,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"12 YEARS A SLAVE is a biographical film about an African man, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, who is a free man living in New York State, but is kidnapped and sold as a slave.  As a free man, he had a wife and children, and had learned to read and play the fiddle.  After being kidnapped and sold as a slave, the man is forced to work on plantations, harvesting sugar cane and cotton.  He is wise enough to learn that he must conceal the fact that he knows how to read.  As a slave, he is beaten and whipped, in view of the fact that the legal system in the Deep South characterized slaves as ""property."" The slavemaster who occupies most of the time on screen is played by Michael Fassbender.  Another slave, played by Lupita Nyong'o, has extensive time on screen, and most viewers will likely cringe at the many scenes in this film where she is beaten, whipped, or raped. Eventually, Chewetel Ejiofor meets a traveling Canadian, played by Brad Pitt, and . . .  [don't worry, I do not disclose the ending].

PART THAT IS DIFFICULT TO PLAY.  I do not envy Michael Fassbender for his part in the film.  Mr. Fassbender is a slave owner, who is also an irrational and paranoid bully and a vicious racist.  This racist aspect of this character is the same as that played by John Lithgow in the film, TUSKEGEE AIRMAN (starring Cuba Gooding and Laurence Fishburne), and also the same as the part played by Alan Tudyk (playing Ben Chapman, manager of the Philadelphia Phillies) in the film called, ""42.""

DIFFICULT TO WATCH.  This film will be difficult to watch for most viewers.  The ""n word"" is used freely and frequently.  Also frequently shown, are slave whippings and a lynching or two.  Chiwetel Ejiofor as well as the other slaves, are forced to be devoid of self and devoid of ego, as was likely the case for many plantations in the United States.  The typical viewer will not enjoy watching the slaves being verbally abused.  On the other hand, as the physical beatings continue during the course of this film, the viewer will also notice the continuing verbal and psychological abuse against the slaves.  As the verbal and psychological abuse continues, the typical adult viewer will likely begin to identify with the characters, and recognize the similarity with the psychological nuances that might be encountered, from time to time, in the employment context.  By psychological abuse, I am referring to paranoia, deception, theft, and rumor-mongering.  In my experience, abuses such as deception, rumor mongering, theft, paranoia, and sometimes assault, are conventional features of corporate culture in about half of all employment situations, e.g., in pharmaceutical companies, universities, and law firms.  As Kurt Vonnegut once wrote, ""So it goes.""

THE ACTORS.  Chiewetel Eijiofor has acted in 25 movies, as of the year 2015.  Lupita Nyong'o, who plays a young slave, is probably best known for her part in STAR WARS VII THE FORCE AWAKENS.  Paul Giamatti plays only a small role in 12 YEARS AS A SLAVE, but my face always lights up when I see him on screen, because of his lovable role as the limo driver in the movie, SAVING MR. BANKS.  Brad Pitt needs no introduction.  Although he does not appear until the last 20 or so minutes of this movie, Brad Pitt's character provides a turning point to the story.  12 YEARS AS A SLAVE earned three Academy Awards.

CONCLUSION.  First, this film is a valuable one, is it provides a realistic-seeming account of slavery in America.  The movie also provides, at least to a small part, the role of the slaves in providing technical guidance and know-how for agricultural practices.  The best source of information for this aspect of slavery is the wonderful book, RICE AND SLAVES by Daniel C. Littlefield.  Second, this film provides a historical precedent for continuing racist practices in the American south.  For example, in South Carolina, it is still the case that African Americans are kept out of dance clubs, restaurants, and taverns.  African-Americans are kept out because of the fact that these establishments have ""membership"" requirements, where all customers are required to fill out a form and to be admitted as a member, before they can order a beer or a meal.  Third, the film provides a forum for great acting, where exemplary scenes depict jealousy, paranoia, deception, rumor-mongering, intimidation, and so on.  Fourth, the film provides an inspiring account of meeting and overcoming challenges.  Thus, although I would not recommend this film as a ""first date"" movie, because of the fact that so many parts are difficult to watch, I do recommend this film for its exemplary accounts of various nuances that are sometimes encountered in the employment context, such as deception, rumor-mongering ,and theft.  Also, I recommend the film because of its apparently accurate accounts of slave auctions, and the whippings and lynchings of slaves.  As Santayana (historian) once said, ""those who do not know history are condemned to repeat it.""",1439510400,2,5009,4.881656804733728

6057594,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"A TRUE STORY ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL WRITTEN BY 'SOLOMON NORTHUP'
In 1841 'Solomon' lives a free man with his wife and two Children, he is tricked and abducted,
then sold into slavery.
He is sold to plantation owner 'Edwin Epps' a man of few principles and a hard task-master.
He is stripped of both his identity and dignity, he is even given a slave-name, 'Platt'
'Solomon' is determined not to forget his past even though there seems to be no hope of
freedom.
As a free man he'd made his own decisions, and had a mind of his own, his ability's are
recognised by an associate of 'Epps' - 'Ford' who actually listens to the views of 'Platt'
and is rewarded with a 'fiddle' an instrument he was skilled in playing.
However the realities of his station soon rears it's ugly head over and over again.
There is little hope for the slaves on the plantation to realize anything but how things
are, however a chance meeting with 'Canadian' abolitionist 'Bass' finally gives 'Platt'
(Solomon) hope for the first time in 12 years.
The film is filled with some extraordinary performances.
Few holds barred in this depiction of the brutal regime slaves often endured in their
world of physical and verbal abuse a constant.
'Solomon' despite all that is thrown at him never gives up hope of returning to his now,
long lost family.
This is an intense and often graphically brutal story.....the horror being is that it's true.

I discussed the movie with friends who have watched it before, and they said they felt emotionally invested in the topic long after they finished the movie.

Just a note: at first I was considering to watch this film with my family. I later decided against it, because the nudity and rape, and especially the violence, was too brutal to watch together with a variety of ages.

6057707,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"Movie Review by Andy McKinney
Twelve Years a Slave
 No movie of 2013 blasted us with such compelling and emotionally engaging images as Twelve Years a Slave, not be a long shot.  I can readily understand the reason that the Academy gave it the Oscar for Best Picture.  It does have some flaws as a picture.  The bulk of the action happens in the deep deep South but none of the actors speak with the slow cadences and inflections of that time and place.  Further, very nearly every Black character speaks with the vocabulary and sensibilities of an educated middle class or higher person.  This includes characters who are illiterate and who have never traveled further than 10 miles from their birth place.  Even lower class white people speak in the language of the upper crust.  It is somewhat off putting to have slaves and their cruel overseers speak like academics at a seminar, but I do not claim this as a fatal flaw.  The brutal truth of the story bulldozes through all conventional methods of evaluating movies.  I have an idea that the language comes from the original 19th century book, written by a well educated and erudite free Black northerner.
 High quality acting embellishes any film, including this one.  The acting and the outstanding cast reminded me of Lincoln in that many people came to work on the film because it was of such historical importance.  And because they knew that the film would be widely scrutinized, every one of the actors brought his best game.  That always pleases an audience.
 Only in America can a Mexican born actress of Kenyan parentage win the Academy Award for best supporting actress in portraying a quintessential American character.  Lupita Nyongo did just that.  The terribly thin young actress did just that beating out other actresses  whose names are household words.  Hers is not the only worthy effort but it is the only one rewarded with the tinsel trinket.
 In the title role as the title character British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor carries the film.  We could not reasonably invent his character, he had to be a real man in 1841 caught in a genuine tragedy.  Audiances might remember Ejiofor from his smaller-and less important historicly-roles in Children of Men, American Gangster and 2012.  He hasn't always been a big star but he surely is now.
 All the other roles are much smaller, including the small role of child actress Quvenzhane Wallis.  She plays the younger version of the title characters daughter.  She became the youngest actress ever nominated for Best Actress for her performance in Beasts of the Southern Wild.  She is off to a tremendous professional career.

 Michael K. Williams, one of my favorite actors from one of my favorite HBO TV series The Wire plays another kidnap victim.  He is brave and refuses to accept his fate.  He is murdered quickly by the kidnap ring before he can even be brought to market.  He also plays a continuing character on Boardwalk Empire as a bootleg era gangster.
 Michael Fassbender turns in a bravo effort as the drunken half mad plantation owner where the kidnapped freeman spends most of his captivity.  Fassbender very nearly makes the slave owner a sympathetic character.  He plays the plantation owner in a way that opened my eyes a little.  He made me see that the institution of slavery was so horrid that even those who benefited by the institution could only cope with the horror with alcohol and insanity.  Only the most subtle actor could pull that off.  It is a clich in sophomore philosophy class that slavery diminishes both the slave and the slave holder but Fassbender shows us the cost-to everyone.
 Garret Dillahunt is known for his comic role on the TV show Raising Hope but he commands such respect as a dramatic actor that the producers of Deadwood brought him in to serve as two utterly different characters.  He shows his dramatic side here as a broken drunk who folly has driven to work alongside the slaves in the cotton fields.
 Other nicely drawn characters are given to us by Paul Giamatti as a callus slave broker.  Giamatti played the other side of that equation once as John Adams, a man who defended slaves.  He maintained that they were men, not property.  Paul Dano plays a weak man who preys on the even weaker slaves.  Finally in this long recitation of truly excellent acting we have Brad Pitt, almost un-recognizably ordinary in long hair and beard as the ultimate instrument of Solomon Northups salvation.  Pitt on only on screen for a few minutes but each one of them are worthwhile.
 The film is based on the autobiographical book by Solomon Northup, a resident of  upstate New York who suffered betrayal, kidnapping and enslavement from 1841 to 1853.  John Ridley took that original work and turned it into a screenplay.  He penned the script for Three Kings, a film of the first Gulf War.  Of note to Arizonans, he also wrote the novel Stray Dogs and the later movie based on it U Turn.  The film stared Jennifer Lopez, Sean Penn, Billy Bob Thornton, Powers Booth and Jon Voight.  It is a film about bad people doing bad things that did not appeal to many ticket buyers but it was filmed in and set in our very own Superior Arizona, just down the highway from Payson.  You would not know it from his work but Ridley is a Black guy.
 Both British and a Black guy is director Steve McQueen (no relation to the actor who was American).  McQueen is known for his plethora of short films rather than his full length films which include Shame and Hunger neither of which became popular hits.
 Fox Searchlight films brought this four saw blade two hour 14 minute film to the theaters.  The producers allowed a modest $20 million for the budget of the movie which has brought in almost $160 million in worldwide box office.  This relentless, horrifying drama is very properly rated with a hard R rating for nudity and vast brutality.
 In a shocking and disgusting bit of historical trivia, there is a short scene in the film where two runaway slaves are hanged for their trouble.  The tree used in the film is the site of an actual event where actual people, runaway slaves as it happens, were murdered.  This is a very serious film.",1426809600,,6185,4.696744186046511

To experience such an ordeal would consume many, yet somehow Northup found the determination to manage under such horrible circumstances. The narrative exposes the sheer cruelty but miraculously sincere rays of humanity shine upon the saddest of despair. An unforgettable cast delivers this story of pain and remarkable resolve.

6057714,3,B00G4Q3KOC,"12 Years A Slave, 2013 film

This is based on the true story about Solomon Northrup, a free Negro from New York, who was kidnapped while visiting Washington and sold into slavery in 1841. An overseer shows the slaves how to cut plants for harvesting. Then they eat a meager dinner. One writes a letter by candlelight. At night he finds a friend to comfort him. A man fiddles for dancers. The location in Saratoga, a resort area (for its waters). Two men want to hire Solomon for a circus in Washington DC , they promise good pay. [Too good to be true?] He awakes shackled and imprisoned! Does he have papers? Or is he a runaway from Georgia? A keeper beats him into submission. [Slavery was legal in Washington DC then.] The slaves are taken by wagon to a paddle wheel steamer. To survive do and say as little as possible is the advice. Is all lost? To protest is to be killed.

One owner shows up to reclaim his property. Solomon recalls his past, shopping with his wife. The slaves are inspected and washed to present them for sale. Children are taken from their mother! Your children will soon be forgotten. [Thats easy for her to say.] The men chop down trees, then attend a religious service on Sunday. Solomon offers advice to his master on transporting logs by using a creek. Master Ford gives him a fiddle. A woman mourns her lost children. A woman tells how she was tricked. Solomon resists an attack. Later three men attack Solomon but are stopped by the overseer from hanging him! Who will help him? Master Ford sells him to settle a debt. Scripture is quoted to command obedience to a master. Now its cotton planting. Their picked cotton is weighed as a measure of productivity.

Mistress Epps doesnt like one woman, but she too must obey. She doesnt like Platt, but sends him on an errand to buy goods. A tag identifies him. No trouble but we see what happened. Platt retrieves Patsy, but there is conflict. Master Epps sees Patsy at night in secret. Platt is sent on another errand to the store. Mistress complains about Patsy again and her husband. Patsy wants to die, and asks Platt to help her. Cotton worms plague the plantation! Master Epps rents his slaves to another plantation (sugar cane?) Platt will be sent to play his fiddle, what he earns he can keep. Master Epps says the plague is gone, there is much work to do now. Those who do not pick enough are whipped. Platt asks an overseer for help in secretly sending out a letter. Will he be betrayed? Platt is clever in his denial.

There is a funeral service for a dead man. Overseer Bass questions the institution of slavery. Master Epps seeks Patsy, she is the best producer. But she will be shipped at her masters whim! Patsy is his property. Later Platt destroys his fiddle. Bass is from Canada, he asks Platts story. Will he write to get freedom for Platt? Then one day a Sheriff arrives to rescue Solomon Northrup, he has proof of his freedom. Solomon returns home and finds changes. [He was one of the few victims of kidnapping to regain freedom.] Legal proceedings failed against his abductors. In 1853 Solomon published his book about this case. He became active in the abolitionist movement and aided fugitive slaves on the Underground Railroad.

This movie provides an example of the horrors of slavery, but is of a depressing nature. Consider it education not entertainment (like some movies about WW II). A book educates best.",1426464000,,3414,4.590163934426229

6057729,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"Facing up to the historical horrors of subjects such as African American slavery in the United States, or the Holocaust, does not automatically make a film great or even worthwhile. However, the film 12 Years a Slave does not simply recount the story of betrayal and vicious inhumanity of one particular slaves rise, fall and potential rise again.  Its mastery lies in its ability to simply linger in moments both horrifying and glorious.  Director Steve McQueen immerses us in the gruesome moments and lets us stew there for full dramatic effect, much as he successfully did in previous works Hunger and Shame.  This is not a mere popcorn night at the movies, but an immersive education that while troubling, needs to be confronted.  @kmptop10",1426032000,2,744,4.975806451612903

Clearly it's central theme is slavery, and the depravity human nature can so easily reach; but it has many other small moments that trigger thoughts about wider issues - the role of religion being one for example. It is violent, and in some respects awful to watch, but this is the story of Solomon Northup told truthfully. There is nothing saccharine about the way Steve McQueen presents this and that is what makes it so astonishing. You cry because what you witness is truly terrible, not because the violins are out and the director's tugging on your heart strings. All the acting is first rate, as is the score by Hans Zimmer.

6057740,1,B00G4Q3KOC,"Probably the book was good, but this exercise in Hollywood liberal self-loathing is flatter than a flap-jack. The main character is so passive the hostility he receives from most of his masters is not credible and undermines the story. No matter what horrors he witnesses (and there are plenty) he does little but stare into space or avert his gaze. His first thought is always to save his own skin, even when the price is whipping a naked female character for the amusement of his psycho alcoholic master. This master happens to be played by Christian Bale, who tries, with increasing panic, to breath some life into this turkey, but to no avail. And the girl character Patsi, the subject of the whipping, apparently won an Academy award for her histrionic performance.

Even Brad Pitt shows up, looking like an Amish hippy and talking like a Hollywood liberal. If he was on the shoot more than two days I'd be surprised.  It seems the premise of the film is that Solomon / Platt (the slave) is educated, but we know that after the first two minutes yet the film keeps beating us over the head with it. And if Solomon / Platt is so smart, how come he falls for the dumbest trap which turns him into a slave in the first place?

The structure of the film is essentially taken from Franz Kafka's short story ""The Metamorphosis"", in which the protagonist wakes up one morning as a giant cockroach. The metaphor is appropriate. This sounds promising, but is not worked out with any kind of rigor.

The other strange thing is that there is no context provided of the larger political picture, they don't say what year the picture is set in until it's over, there is little foreshadowing of change or war. Also annoying, is all the characters' southern accents seem to have come from out of nowhere, they are a mish-mash and give no sense of the musicality or richness of southern language.

I kept imagining Denzel in this role, slitting the overseer's throat with a home made knife and organizing a slave rebellion, but no such luck. Save your money.

It's not completely true to the book, but the added events do heighten the drama and sharpen the themes. My one criticism of the film is the representation of women, which in general, I think, serves to heighten the heroism of the male characters but diminishes or completely erases the fortitude, leadership, and strength of enslaved women of that time. The film gives the viewers many different angles on the brutality and inhumanity of American slavery, the legacies of which are still very much with the U.S. today.",1423958400,,656,5.083333333333333

The acting was superb and the characters were full of strength and the ability to make it through those horrible times. I would recommend this movie to those wanting a true glimpse into this particular era in American History.  jhill,1422403200,,404,4.611111111111111

6057829,2,B00G4Q3KOC,"This ""black exploitation film"" lacks any real sense of narrative, instead it showcases a near-sardonic attempt at complete savagery. The film is highly racist against white people, as it attempts to capitalize on the ""brutal"" scenes and endear the white audience as somehow responsible for slavery, which we of the present, are in no way culpable.

It is ineffective as both a polemic and drama. Brad Pitt (one of the film's producers) appearing as a ridiculous, self righteous cartoon, lowers it even more into the territory of baseless sentimentalism.

The director is working simply on hyperbolic elements, which make this film highly ""unreal"".  No doubt he is merely using it as visual propaganda, for what cause, remains to be seen.

I would not take such a film to be serious at all.",1421452800,,789,4.954545454545454

It's unfortunate that a large majority of African Americans can't see that racism has declined to such an incremental percentage.

I wish Paul Dano hadn't been type cast (again) as the crazy, out-of-control ""mean"" guy.  Although, he is so good at that.  Chiwetel Ejiofor was excellent.  Brad Pitt's small role saved the day.

Slavery was of course wrong anyways, but I had no prior idea that American citizens were drugging and capturing their own--without any social concious.

I took away the two stars because Solomon is too naive even for being a free man. He is so eager to make money that he met up with strange people who were promising him easy money. This is where our story took a turn for the worse--and he was sold off into slavery. Hindsight is 20/20 and we live in a much more jaded era--where the background of anybody can easily be checked prior to a meeting.

He becomes the property of numerous traders and the hope of returning home, to normality becomes more unlikely. Rather than full character development the movie is a series of snippets that progress you through Northrup's free-man, kidnapping, slave trade, abuse, servitude, struggle for freedom, relationships, liberation, and return to his family.

The director did not tell us what to think about the people, or the events unfolding. he gave us the freedom to think for ourselves. This was major for me. He allowed me to think for myself. He presented the situation, stood back, and allowed me to go into my own thoughts. I saw human beings caught in a terrible distortion of what it means to be fully human.

Both slave and master were being deprived of true humanity. It is impossible to cage another human being without also being en-caged yourself. Even the men who hung those two slaves were themselves in a mental and physical world of hate; of darkness.",1417478400,,785,4.5928571428571425

It would have been a much better story if handled as a story of something bad that happened to a good person. Every nationality and race of people have suffered, I watch most of them, because something bad can happen to good people and does everyday. My heart goes out to them, and I hope I don't become one of them.  But the ""poor me see what happen to my people"" attitude is not what I like.  My people were prosecuted and unfair treatment was experienced by them. I believe everyone can say this about their people's history.  You don't see everyone else with a poor me attitude, the world owes me a living, type of chip on their shoulder.",1416700800,,805,4.269736842105263

6057994,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"I rented this movie from my local public library. I thought the film was great. how much was doctored up for TV and how much was true I couldn't even began to tell you.
In this film the our man is kidnapped, well more like abducted. In prisoned and then sent to the south and sold as a salve. He was beaten.  He was an educated man, working in I think New York before he was ripped from his family.
Sold to a couple of different masters, he worked hard and try to keep out of the radar.
At the end of the movie he meets a man doing labor on the plantations and befriends him. He asks him to take a message to a friend in the north. He agrees and great peril to himself.
His friend arrives to retrieve him with his free papers.  And is returned home to his family after 12 years to a happy home coming.
From what I understand this story is based on a book written by the man that lived the ordeal. He must have been of strong character to survive so long under such conditions.
I always find it disgraceful on how badly we treated fellow humans in the 1800s to the mid 1900s even today.
This movie is a real eye opener, and I truly believe it is worth watching.",1416441600,,1160,4.039130434782609

6058001,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"One of those few movies you can't over hype, this one is special. You can count me as one of those people that resisted seeing this because I thought ""I've seen enough media on slavery to know it's an abomination and was a horrible fact of our country's history, this movie will simply be a retelling of whats been done in Amistad, Glory, Amazing Grace, Roots, etc"" This move hits at something different. In most slave movies there are clear lines, oppressive slave holders versus their slaves and those who wish them free. This movie is about the failures of our human character which allow systems like slavery to exist and persist. The blame touches everyone in this film, slave, abolitionist and slave master. A brutally honest film.",1416182400,,737,4.765625

I would have rated it 5 stars but for the mediocre to poor picture quality.  I bought the alleged HD version and the picture quality varied between good and very poor.  Most of the time it was more or less watchable, but frequently peoples faces were undicernable blobs.  I can't believe I paid $13. for this low of picture quality.  I stream things from Netflix often and have never seen this problem.  The Amazon videos take way too long to load before you can begin the movie also.  I will try to watch this video again and see if the quality improves the next time.  If it is no different, I will contact Amazon to file a complaint.

6058008,1,B00G4Q3KOC,"As a former northerner I knew something was amiss at the get go in this
film. Have you ever been to Philadelphia, recently? The Saratoga News
clips mentioned in other reviews cite such a dramatically different
account of this main characters plight as to almost be seen as
terrorism. The incite to riot appears to be the main goal of this film
and I found it appalling. With every scene, a white southerner, and
don't forget to include those evil women as well this time around, was
grimacing with delight to defile, defeat, and attempt to kill their
chattel. Does that make any sense when you want productivity?

I thought ""Gone With the Wind"" was racist and after watching this
horror film, I redefined the term. It is completely irresponsible for
the Producers to have funded this effort. The ""Passion of Christ"" I
could only watch using the option for the blind captions. But I found I
did not have the stomach to complete this even worse aberration of
film. The music of dread, scary drumbeats, and overall cruelty were
incessant undertones to further complete the torture saga.

I pray the truth about this man's account comes to bear and that those
so affected to further indemnify the South will balance their views
with more accuracy. I am horrified this film was an award winning,
highly acclaimed manipulation of history to exploit for profit.

Slavery is alive and well today and is a serious threatening global
issue. Perhaps this debate will highlight a topic for the next award
winning effort.

6058069,3,B00G4Q3KOC,"The huge problem with an uncompromisingly, relentessly, unpleasant film like this, is that it's so worthy, and so acclaimed, that to criticise it almost seems like sacrilege. But two and a half hours of numbingly dull, graphic awfulness doesn't necessarily make great drama, or a great film. And despite the breathless approval that it's received, in my opinion, it isn't a great film. So I hesitate to say what I feel, but I must. Considering that it's doing everything it can to impress and confront us with this shameful period in American history, I thought it was one dimensional, and some of the characters - especially Michael Fassbinder's - offensively close to comic book caricatures. There were more than few moments when I was reminded of a terrible exploitation film on a similar subject, many years ago called 'Mandingo'.

6058098,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"I wasn't able to see in theaters so I am happy to have a copy. The impact of film is still with me days after viewing.  I once read a quote from a Holocaust death camp survivor: ""the best among us did not survive."" This film shows that dilemma better than any cultural product I've witnessed. How do we survive with dignity in a world gone mad? Slavery is a blight on our nation's history and character. Coming to terms with it is necessary if we ever want to grow up as a nation. The wealth of America was built, in a great part, on the black labor forced by whip, chains and rape. Our continued racial divide needs the conversation this film stimulates. It is not an easy film to watch or an easy conversation to have. It is, however, important, nonetheless.

It must always be kept in mind that Northup's story is amplified in scope and depth by the multitude of lifelong slaves who suffered for hundreds of years.",1412899200,,917,4.356725146198831

6058100,4,B00G4Q3KOC,This movie actually follows the real life account written by Solomon Northup in the 1850's.  The book can be purchased at Amazon and I would recommend reading it.  Solomon was an exceptional individual that was highly intelligent and educated who describes his 12 years as a slave.  The movie accurately describes that ordeal and the inhumanity of slavery.  The acting  and directing was excellent doing the story great justice.,1412812800,2,428,5.144927536231884

6058104,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"There are no words to describe this moving and all too true story.  I can tell you it's part of the reason a free trial to Ancestry.com can't possibly work for everyone, and why as the product of an interracial marriage I've felt the sting of racism from simple box checking (black, white, Hispanic, non-Hispanic) to seeing how easily my mother's family can map out the origins of their family tree, to watching the inter-workings of institutionalized racism that exists today. I'm sure I'll have some who disagree with me, but I only ask that until you've walked even 1/4 of a mile in my shoes or read statistics from a neutral source,  and watch this movie with an open mind then maybe you'll understand why people of color harbor resentment and fear. We've been a slave state longer than we've had freedom, and we're barely free to walk to walk/drive/shop without being reminded , that,  like Salomon (or Oprah)  we can't be trusted.

6058111,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"I had to give myself a moment to finish sobbing and reflect quietly before giving ""12 Years a Slave"" a well-deserved 10/10. Few movies move me to so much emotion and provoke so much thought and gratefulness for living in a times, while still imperfect, not at all like the one Solomon and countless others had to endure. It's so unfortunate that, after everything he went through, human justice failed- though I am certain, without a shadow of a doubt, divine justice stepped in one way or another. No one escapes the righteous fury of the God who mourns the suffering of His children.
 I was well aware since grade school that slavery is one among the many horrid evils humans are capable of, but watching a documentary like this makes me feel evermore aware- it's like how you know Jesus was Crucified and Passion movies tell the story in a way that helps you better understand that reality. That's what this movie does for those who think they already know slavery happened and find themselves surprised by the power of enlightenment that hits their brain and yanks violently at their heartstrings.
 I'm glad he was able to return to his family finally- if only all could've had such a happy ending (or as happy as it could get back then, anyway)",1412467200,5,1249,4.621621621621622

This movie delivers the horrible treatment in a way that I haven't seen before and I am so grateful that I saw it and shared this man's journey. Survival as a slave, as so well depicted here, takes more self control and deep human will than any other challenge faced by mankind that I can think of. Watch this film and wonder whether you could survive this terrible ordeal. Those who did survive slavery are thus among America's greatest heroes. In the end, this is an uplifting story about a horror in this nation's legacy and I'm sure that's why it was so well received.",1411516800,,708,4.453846153846154

6058151,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"At the rate reviews are posting for this film, I realize this review will disappear off the first page in days; but that's a good thing, because any film that can elicit all the reaction 12 YEARS A SLAVE is garnering, the story is moving countless people to respond.  Based on the true story of Solomon Northup, a free man living in New York who is kidnapped and sold into slavery in Louisiana, 12 YEARS A SLAVE examines the ugliness, inhumanity, and absolute brutality that was America's most glaring national shame.  Director Steve McQueen (gotta love that name for cinema) doesn't sugarcoat the ugliness that was slavery; the viewer is privy to everything, from the beatings to the degradation to the outright humiliation human beings were forced to endure--all at the hands of other human beings.  Accordingly 12 YEARS A SLAVE is a difficult film to watch, but it's also a compelling viewing, as Solomon refuses to succumb to hopelessness and despair, but instead perseveres, and ultimately is rewarded.

The cast is exemplary, beginning with Chiwetel Ejiofor in the lead role.  This versatile actor is the anchor of the entire film, and he has his audience pulling for him from the beginning.  Several well-known actors appear in powerful, yet smaller roles, including Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano (in a most disturbing role), Sarah Paulson, Alfre Woodard, Garret Dillahunt, and Brad Pitt.  Michael Fassbender is fascinating as an evil, calculating slave owner; Lupita Nyong'o equally mesmerizing as Patsey, a young woman who draws the ire of Fassbender's character.  Again, it's difficult to watch, yet it's totally believable, culminating in a highly emotional payoff.  More than worthy of all its accolades and awards, 12 YEARS A SLAVE is an extraordinary epic not to be missed.

Its inspired by a real person and a real event, so that makes it have even more of an impact. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays a free African American black man, Solomon Northup, who gets  sold to slavery, by a couple of scheming opportunist. Its about how he survives. He often has to compromise his ethics and morals and do some pretty crazy and brave things to get through it all. Some of the scenes are just heart breaking. Some people walked out on it when we saw it at the theater. I don't think they thought it was a bad movie per-say. I think they just couldn't take it anymore. I mean, I don't think Im giving anything away, since its about slavery, but there are whipping scenes in it  that are disturbing. The acting by everyone from Brad Putt to Lupita Nyong'o  and especially Michael Fassbender are just superb. Steve McQueen, as I said has an interesting style to get a point across. Theres one scene that is an uncomfortably extended single camera shot for, what would be to long if any other director tackled it, but he plays it off perfectly and it really hits home.

6058210,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"This has to be the best and most realistic film about slavery in America. It would take Steve McQueen, a black man from the UK, to produce and direct it. That says a lot about Hollywood, where for numerous years they either had blacks played by whites with blackface or they portrayed blacks as bumbling idiots. Sorry, Congresswoman Bachmann, slavery in America was not ended by Americas founding fathers as you so stupidly assert. This film deserves every award that it has received.

6058224,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"12 Years a Slave, as a movie, is fantastic.  As a period piece, it's great.  As fact, it's not quite so.  This is a movie BASED on a book.  Should you actually read the book and learn a little something about Solomon you'd see the fact from the fiction. By no means am I lessening the horror of either his kidnapping or slavery as a whole.

I was pleased to see very realistic scenery of Louisiana.  It is a beautiful place and there are still many Southern mansions.  Again, I abhor the thought of slavery.  I just an pleased that this movie was shot in an area of which the movie and story are actually set.

One thing I would like to bring up, the number of slaves who were well spoken is far greater on the movie than truthfully so.  It is highly doubtful a slave would ever say they had taken a walk to ""commune with God"".",1410048000,,827,4.144654088050315

6058229,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"12 Years a Slave is a REALLY tough film to watch.  It's an emotional rollercoaster ride as the character of Chiwetel Ejiofor gets tortured time and time again all because he was promised a shot at a circus only to wake up and find out he'd been drugged, chained and locked in a dingy dark room since the supposed circus entertainers are nothing more than slave traders.  He's soon shipped to a Louisiana plantation.  He has to persevere some extremely harsh predicaments such as whippings, endless farming with other slaves, constant yelling and threats, forced to entertain white folks with his violin talents, getting acquainted with fellow slaves who have their own hardships, etc.

This is a tough movie to watch simply because the acting is so phenomenal and believable you'd swear these events are actually happening right now.  Some of the most shocking and gruesome slave torturing I've ever seen in a slave film.  You really feel for the one black girl in particular named Lupita Nyong'o who's so small and helpless and yet when she disobeys the white family who owns her in one segment, she gets the beating of her life.  You really feel anger that the man beating her shows no sympathy whatsoever and instead keeps screaming over and over about how she was wrong for what she did and needed punished as a result.  Anyone with a brain should understand human beings shouldn't be treated this way and yet, slavery's been going on for hundreds of years.  Unbelievable.  Man the blood flying from the intensity of the whippings with each swing... this is VERY shocking.

Anyway Chiwetel Ejiofor's character begs and pleads that he has a family and he's a free man, but of course the slave owners give him their own name, make him a slave and tell him to forget about his past since it doesn't matter anymore.  I knew the character played by Paul Dano would end up being a no good son of a gun based on his jealous attitude towards Chiwetel whenever he'd display his house building talents and other contributions, and sure enough Paul starts making trouble.  However how great was it when Chitwetel kicked Paul Dano's rear-end hard and whipped him silly!  Talk about letting out necessary aggression!  For a few minutes you really feel satisfaction that Chiwetel would have this one golden moment of bliss.  Of course we all knew Chiwetel would have to pay a horrible price for disobeying his white owner (that results in quite the shocking moment involving a hanging that extends for several agonizing minutes- VERY uncomfortable watching this part) but yeah, that one moment with Paul Dano getting beat sure was great!

There's rape scenes, suicidal requests, torture the likes of which I've never seen previously in other slave movies and this movie is not for the weak-minded at all.  Whether this kind of torture and mistreatment happened as violently as portrayed in 12 Years a Slave remains questionable for some, but I believe it's mostly true.  Hey the story's based off the real-life story of slave Solomon Northup that he experienced in the 1850's, so we really have no choice but to believe this incredibly depressing display of slavery is in fact realistic.  What a shame.  Hard giving such a movie 5 stars when you despise what the story's about and presented with realistic portrayals, but I was focused watching the movie the entire way through so it succeeds in strongly keeping my interest.",1409961600,,3415,4.823327615780446

6058239,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"The eponymous book has just been adapted into a film. In fact it is the second time.

The first time was in 1984 under the title Twelve Years a Slave Solomon Northup's Odyssey. The more recent adaptation, 12 Years A Slave, kept the title of the book and is based or connected to this present edition of the book.

This fact brings a question to mind that is more and more asked among people: is that interest for the past of African Americans in the recent period the sign of a deep change in the cultural and mental approach of the Blacks and slavery in the United States, or is it only a fad reflecting the fact that the President of the United States has been black since 2008 and will be till 2016? I do not have an answer to that question and I lean towards a twofold approach: the fact that the President of the United States is a black man has some influence on the United States as a whole and every American in particular, and on the other hand Americans have always cultivated their historical dimension probably because they are all of them, except American Indians, uprooted immigrants who were transplanted into a new continent, by force or by choice. All Americans have thus to face this important period in their past: slavery that started for the English colonists in 1619 and ended for the Americans in 1865, though it continued in some form of apartheid or other till the end of the 20thcentury if not till today.

There could be a third side to the question reflecting a change among the Blacks themselves. Since the beginning of this century the Blacks influenced by the mostly Christian NAACP and those influenced by the Nation of Islam have developed an approach of their heritage as Post Traumatic Stress. They have two names for this. The First group calls it Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome and they are essentially centered on the concept of reparations, hence a collective approach, neglecting the psychological individual problem and hence admitting more or less, like Booker T. Washington, that they have no knowledge of their ancestry. The second group calls it Post Traumatic Slavery Disorder and they are centering their approach on an individual procedure within group processing to help each individual and his group to understand and step out of the problem by re-assessing and revalorizing their past generations and their heritage going as far as possible within slavery itself.

The recent adaptation of the book (first published in 1853) is outstanding in spite of the fact that it cuts a lot of stuff from it. It shortens the legal battle at the end for example but it gives a clear vision of what the Trauma of slavery was and how the Blacks managed to go through it. Never did they really drop their belief that surviving was not worth suffering for. The film gives some fundamental elements that enabled the Black to survive under the worst possible duress and violence. First of all the very planters and slave owners for reasons that have not yet been explained on the Anglo-Saxon side of slavery actually preached their slaves the Bible and Christianity. In the film one planter uses it to elevate their morals and ethical vision, and another uses it to justify his violence against them. But in a way or another they transmitted to them, more nilly than willy, willy-nilly anyway a religious vision that claimed hope and that eternal life was won by suffering in this world. The slaves turned this belief around into a clandestine and underground call for rebellion (openly stated in the next world) in the name of freedom doubled with a tremendous patience in front of the real situation that was a sign of some complicity with God himself. One song, in front of the grave of an old slave, is just that double message. Booker T. Washington explains in his autobiography Up From Slavery:

Most of the verses of the plantation songs had some reference to freedom. True, they had sung those same verses before [emancipation and the end of the Civil War], but they had been careful to explain that the freedom in these songs referred to the next world, and had no connection with this life in the world. Now [after the full emancipation after the Civil War] they gradually threw off the mask, and were not afraid to let it be known that the freedom in their songs meant freedom of the body in this world. (p. 21-22)

The other elements that enabled the slaves to keep their sanity for one and their dignity in their survival for two is the direct negation of what Willie Lynch had said: deprive them of their language, deprive them of their culture, deprive them of their religion. He thought that by doing that he would be able to negate their humanity. The Slaves just had to learn another language (the interest of their own masters), English, French or Spanish, and then this new language enabled them to retain and develop their mental power and intelligence. They replaced their old religions with Christianity though they often invested in this Christianity some old beliefs and myths producing Voodoo, for example and other local Africanized version of Christianity. They retained their rhythmic culture and nature and they transformed any task performed on the plantation under duress and violent overseeing into a singing class, a rhythmic experience, a unique cultural survival (enabling them to keep the rhythm of the work, hence satisfying the interest of the planter and escaping whipping in the evening). Actually it is this cultural survival that has produced the music of the Blacks in America and that music has become the polyrhythmic music of the world today. It is a shame the film does not five a full experience of a Christmas vacation all planters provided their slaves with. That was one of these moments (present in the book) when the Black slaves were mostly reviving and re-energizing their own African heritage, even five or ten generations after the Middle Passage.

The film shows that mental survival, at the cost of psychological trauma, and we can thus understand that even when a slave wanted to die in order to escape his or her suffering, the survival instinct, multiplied by their own survival experience, will be stronger and will take over and enable him or her to go on one more step or two. The main character, Solomon Northup, is the acme of that survival attitude in how he manages to never forget who he was and still is, in spite of his having to hide his real nature and identity behind the imposed name and identity of Platt.

After the lethal selection of the Middle Passage, the Africans who had survived crossing theAtlantic had managed to develop this survival stance that will enable them to enrich our world today with one of the greatest African heritage we all share in music.

But that has not erased the Post Traumatic Slave/Slavery Syndrome/Disorder because this PTSS/D is individual and has to be treated individually. Their survival stance is collective but the consequences of slavery are essentially psychological and individual. This will explain why Black education advocated by Booker T. Washington and some others did not solve the PTSS/D problem: it did not even address the question. Neither did Marcus Garvey succeed because he only considered the collective level of the problem. In fact NAACP is not the best approach for the problem and it is among the Muslims of the Nation of Islam that today we find the most realistic and effective cure for that PTSS/D. Strangely enough this film, more than the book, does not really cover the Post Traumatic Stress of Slavery, even for Solomon Northup who yet manages to ask for forgiveness from his wife and children, though he did not do anything wrong: his twelve years as a slave have transformed him into a humble fault-carrying individual instead of standing like a liberated and hence regenerated victim.

6058315,3,B00G4Q3KOC,"I had read the original book away back in college, so I looked forward to this screen adaptation.  The results were both rewarding and disappointing.

The main criticism is the screenwriters and producers could not avoid laying it on thick, drawing on every emotion-wrenching clich of  the heaviest abolitionist stereotypes.  From the wench-turned-mistress (Alfre Woodard) prophesying the destruction of the plantation class, to lynchings of runaways, to the overseer Tibeats (Paul Dano) tauntingly singing the old runaway folk tune in Solomon's face, the film overdoes its points.  In doing so, it misses the nuance and matter-of-fact naturalness of the original narrative. Northup's avoidance of sensationalism is exactly what made his account so compelling.  This production has sacrificed that, and harmed itself.

But even in over-dramatizing, the film captures the essential injustice of both slavery as a system and that done to one man.  The real message of the film, Northup's narrative, and its universal truth is summarized in the dialogue between Epps (Fassbender) and Bass (Brad Pitt):  ""A man has a right to do as he wants with his property"" vs. ""what's right is right for all,"" or there are no rights at all. That scene also subtly raises the issue of how easily freedom can be taken from the free: a warning for those enjoying the lavish period recreation of frontier Louisiana.

It's still a great story, and it could have made a great film.  Unfortunately it didn't quite measure up, but it did capture the essence of Northup's ordeal and the root evils of slavery.  On a technical point, the summary notes detailing the fate of Northup and other characters is not readable except on the largest screens.  Perhaps future editions will adapt the ratios accordingly.",1408320000,2,1782,5.145833333333333

6058328,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"Jack Mord, the popular archivist and collector of 19th century post-mortem and medical photography said that he believes the people in that era were a bit 'off'.  I definitely agree.

CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT

As you've likely read elsewhere, I have to agree that character development is lacking in this movie, but it also greatly contributes to the story.  I also think it ironic that others focus so greatly on that criticism, especially as slavery is simply not a story that most US Americans wish to reflect on at length.  Given some other serious diversions from the actual account depicted in this movie, I think greater character development of the black slaves would have in turn required greater character development of the white slave holders and owners.

ESSENCE

The director did an excellent job of telling a story that clearly was difficult and yet developed characters that were all human, lovable and worthy of dignity and respect.  All of them.  When such can be said about all characters in a gruesome slave flick, I think it's phenomenal.",1408060800,2,1056,4.988571428571428

As a side note, it's sad to say there are more slaves world wide now then ever in history.

I do find the civil rights movement, which I support is very hypocritical in one extent,
ignoring the African's role in capturing other Africans for slaves.  That is how they
got caught and sold.

Fortunately, this one is well done and just tells the reality and story, sort of just the facts but you are invested in some characters.  It is sometimes tough to watch if you are sensitive to violence and cruelty.  It is not a ground breaking film or remarkable in any cinematic way but is very good and, well, I agree with Hollywood, we should watch. We do not learn much in our schools about our uncomfortable history. Be aware that there is violence, sadness, remorse, horror at what humans are capable of, but it is accurate. We have to look at ourselves dead on sometimes and hope that we can adjust our future paths based on our past mistakes.",1406851200,,838,4.506578947368421

6058453,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"This film was highly intense, a little too violent, but kept my attention throughout always waiting to see what would come in the next scene.  The full brutality of slavery constantly hit you in the face and the way the characters were dehumanized made me a bit angry.  I understand there were slave whippings and brutality in how slaves were treated, but the director could have made his point without so many repeated scenes of violence. There was a bit of overkill with the scenes of slave hangings  and whippings.  The rape scene was tame by comparison.  That being said, I think all the lead characters deserve academy awards.  The acting was fantastic throughout and the actors were totally immersed into their characters.  The scene of the mother being separated from her children was particularly emotional to me.  Still, throughout the movie, you kept pulling for Chiwetel Ejofor's character to survive and make his way back to freedom.  Especially liked the positive ending but sad to see the other slaves left behind to their fate at the hands of a highly brutal and sadistic slave owner.  Ironic to see the owner reading from the Bible to slaves in one scene and then whipping a slave in another.  This movie is a must see, but you lose your taste for popcorn after the first brutality.",1406073600,,1298,4.75

6058460,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"12 Years a Slave may have a clear title, but this film is anything but what youd expect. It is not the saccharine-sweet pat on the back like Spielbergs Lincoln or anything warm-fuzzy like Roots. Steve McQueen has hit his third home run in a row with this gritty, haunting story of American cruelty.

In some ways, it almost reminded me of Pasolinis Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom in how it showed the cruelty humanity can put up with, or even commit, in order to survive. It is just as painful to watch the enslaved Solomon Northup be whipped and beaten as it is to watch him do nothing as the same happens to victims around him.

On a broader level, its fascinating how these characters create a sense of order for themselves, in a world so full of cruelty and chaos. Almost everyone speaks in beautiful, nearly-Shakespearean language, heightening the sheer intelligence and thought everyone has put into how they face their often desperate circumstances. Whether Michael Fassbender as Edwin Epps practicing horrific cruelty believing such is Gods will, or Chiwetel Ejiofor defending his master William Ford as a good one under the circumstances, its illuminating to see how these characters warp their realities in order to live through them.

McQueen takes no emotional cheap shots, or force any sentimentality or remorse out of it. Your guttural response is from merely the actions, as the camera is forcing you to witness them for yourself. No artistic work Ive yet seen shows the condition of slavery as horrifyingly as 12 Years a Slave.

Its not easy to watch but Id consider it almost essential viewing. This film is a landmark not only for how neorealistically it approaches its subject matter, but also for its broader and, frankly, disturbing message about humanity.",1405987200,20,1777,4.854785478547854

Unbelievably sad and truly horrifying. It really did make you feel the terror of slavery of the time. I do feel like it could've been made better though. The actors were great but the scenes were so unneccesarily long. The dialogue sometimes did not feel true to the time period using words Im pretty sure weren't even used at that time. Don't mean to be a snob and I am by no means an expert so if I picked up on it, it must be pretty obvious to others as well. It just really didn't come together for me like I feel like it should. Some scenes were so unnecessary to the story and were even confusing in my opinion. SPOILER ALERT: It wasn't lost on me though that Brad Pitt casts himself in such a heroic role.

6058554,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"It comes to no surprise for me that I liked the film. I knew I would enjoy it even before it was released it just seemed like that uplifting true take on slavery. The film, unlike many, did justice to the topic of slavery, not skipping on the dirty details that has been polished before in many, many film adaptions of the same topic of slavery. And then the film took 9 nominations at the Academy Award. Of course it only won two of those awards, it got what it deserved. While I still feel 'Gravity' was the better film, '12 Years a Slave' was a close second and here is why. My review of '12 Years a Slave'.

 '12 Years a Slave' follows Solomon Northup, a free man, kidnapped and forced into slavery under the name 'Platt' for 12 years, facing the hardships of being a slave, under the hands of a few different slave owners.

The story of Solomon Northup is based on his biography written by himself and titled '12 years a Slave'. The film ended up being scripted brilliantly by 'John Ridley'. Ridley wrote all the details of slavery into his lengthy screenplay, and left nothing out. He faithfully adapted Northup's biography into a film script having taken all it had and putting it onto another piece of paper, adding little attachments. His script work was beautiful, yet sometimes flawed. By flawed, I mean that it isn't always clear as to the events occurring, sometimes ending up avoiding realistic situations in favor of instead moving onto another problem, never fully coming to light on a problem. For example, the fact that Northup, a slave, got away with beating a white man, with his own wipe, and not getting punished is beyond shocking to me, and then next thing you know he is being traded to Epps. His script was smart, but flawed. It never holds back, it is raw and compelling.

The cast portrays the historical characters with realistic expressions and motions and, whatever. British man, 'Chiwetel Ejiofor' powerfully leads the cast as Solomon Northup. He pulls you into the story, he shows you pain; he shows you kindness, and hardships. He gave us the impact that we need. He emotionally connected with us; his character did, because of Ejiofor. Not to mention that Ejiofor perfectly masks his British voice, in a convincing American one. Another delight was the heartbreaking and tear jerking performance from newcomer, (and Academy Award Winner) 'Lupita Nyong'o'. Her situation and pain is felt, just as much a Northup's. And during the films most controversial and cringworthy scene at the end of the film, she holds her own, making you shoat for mercy the whole time. She fits the slave Patsey perfectly, and I couldn't imagine anybody better to play the role. 'Michael Fassbender' plays the worthless slave owner during most of the film's second and third acts. He makes every sound stop. Whenever he yells, your heart stops beating, because you know there's trouble. He plays the villain perfectly. The rest of the cast does well in their roles as well. There's just one guy I don't believe fit, and that was 'Paul Dano' as the second hand to the nice slave owner William Ford. He just seemed too young for the role, even if he acted solidly; it just wasn't convincing enough for me.

The musical score is strange, it doesn't play often, but when it does it hits you. It sets you in the mind frame of what's happening, it undertones the lines. If there is violence, the music is heard playing to the beat of the cry of whoever is getting hurt. It's emotional, it's driving, and it's original. And of course it was done by 'Hans Zimmer'. It's gripping, powerful, and works with the scenes to hit you harder then you thought you'd be hit.

Direction from 'Steve McQueen' was extraordinary. He knows how to helm a feature. He shocks you with affective camerawork. He gives you many shots of Ejiofor's face to express his emotions and expressions in reenactment to what is placed on him, and what he is thinking. And he uses his techniques to convey the suffering of the slaves. He never went and skimped, when he promised he would make an excellent retelling of Solomon Northup's tale. He knew what he wanted and went for it, directing an excellent feature.

The editing was creative and effective. What you see is shots that are cut where you just linger in a particular area for a much longer period of time, letting you absorb what is occurring or what has occurred, or what will occur. It helps keep you invested in Northup's tale, and wanting more.

All and all, '12 Years a Slave' is a powerful, raw, emotional, film that never goes limp on all the gory details of Northup's tale of survival. It succeeds in impacting you emotionally with the powerful performances, solid scriptwriting and creative camerawork, and will leave you thinking for moments after the films end.

Unfortunately this was not what was promised as an Academy award winning film. Make sure you check the reviews around the web about this film. DO NOT expect to see a fine, well written, expansive film with new and astonishing information about slavery. DO be prepared for brutal graphic gratuitous  violence that is done this way only in cheap _movies_ for stunning effect. Many scenes with this element do nothing to advance the plot, Hitchcock is spinning in his grave. Further, about those scenes, I found myself predicting the next word, line, plot sequence, or full chapter - nothing was subtle until the screen was dark and the words describing what would have been interesting about the life of this tortured individual rolled - this was high drama - too bad it was not in the film.",1404345600,8,896,4.780645161290322

6058615,3,B00G4Q3KOC,"I read a synopsis online of the details of what happened to Solomon and I found it to be even more amazing than the film.  This film has wonderful performances, but it's basically only about Solomon's treatment as a slave and ends there. It doesn't go into the whole story. It doesn't go into how Soloman was born free (his father was a slave in the north, but his 'master' granted him his freedom in his will. His father did well as a free man and he became a land owner himself) His mother was 3/4ths white and 1/4 black.  It doesn't go into how he caught smallpox during the ship voyage or how he got a Sailor on that ship to send word to his father's old 'master's' family (Northup is the name they took from the family that owned his father before he was freed).  It was Northup's son Henry who received the letter from the sailor and told his wife Ann what had happened. (So his wife knew what had happened to him during all those years)  Because Henry Northup was a lawyer he knew how to use the law to get him back home, but because he didn't know where Solomon was going to end up he couldn't do anything.  In order to take action he had to know where he was, but when he did eventually find out where he was, Henry Northup was instrumental in rescuing Solomon.  And then of coarse there were the legal trials against his kidnappers... which were a hole other drama that caused enough stir for the New York Times to publish on it.  First the trial against his first 'owner' in washington where blacks were not allowed to testify in trial so the owner got off scott free.  Then the trial against his kidnappers, whom no one could find because they used false names... but after Solomon published his book a Judge in New York recalled seeing two white men whom he knew well accompanied by a black man traveling to Washington and he recalled that when they returned they were without the black man.  They also asked him to please call them by different names while in the company of the black man.  This judge wondered if it was possible that these were the two involved in the kidnapping.  Sure enough they were!  What are the chances of that?  The kidnappers were arrested, but after lengthy trial and appeals they never paid for their crime even though both Solomon and the county judge testified against them.  NONE of this is in the movie!  I liked the movie, but they left some of the most interesting things out.  This is probably the only time I'll be able to say that the real life story was more interesting than the film.",1404086400,7,2538,4.356687898089172

Don't watch this with the kids, I have seen many films with many scenes, but one scene in this will anger and hurt you to the point that you will look away.  It is an almost involuntary reaction to protect yourself.

6058633,3,B00G4Q3KOC,"I gave this movie three stars out of five because it was well done. But while it may be an accurate film version of the book (I haven't read it), it is unfortunate that the director chose this story above all others. Yes, it is brutal enough. Yes, it does show some of what slaves had to endure. Yes, it does show how the fugitive slave law made it possible for white slavers to capture free black men. But it also leaves its audience with the impression that good white men from Canada (in fact, good-looking white men from Canada) were the ones that freed the slaves, and they did it using the legal system. AND it worked no matter if the plantation were in the deep south (I got the impression the plantation Mr. Fassbender's character ran was in Mississippi).

I want someone to show the story of Frederick Douglas - the full story, including his brave work as an abolitionist, and including William Lloyd Garrison's helpful (but prejudiced) work on his behalf. I want people to see how the church - mostly the English church - helped American abolitionists.

While the film was good - and it probably was chosen for its acceptability to whites - it was too polite. Let's see a more typical story.",1403654400,,1201,4.504587155963303

My only quibble is the depiction of his life prior/post slavery: I found it hard to imagine the seemingly color-neutral respect he was accorded in the North.  Even today, a black person's interaction with whites is hardly color-blind, yet the director portrayed a ""free"" black man in the North as treated as a totally equal, and respected member of society.  Seems a bit far fetched.

6058673,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"12 Years a Slave is a good film but in no wise was it the best picture of the year. I would have liked it more had it not been so heavy-handed in so many ways. Based on a true story, it needed to have been told no matter how painful the message. Movie goers need a counterpoint to sanitized versions of slavery presented in films like Gone With the Wind. Slavery was evil and a blot on our nation's history. So many people suffered horrible indignities along with physical and psychological brutality in a supposed ""land of the free"" and most of that was wrought by Caucasians. It is a shame upon my race and rightly so. With that said, I feel the film lost some validity in telling it's powerful and painful story by painting almost every white person with negative strokes. You had to get to the end of the film before you encountered a white person with integrity, decency, and compassion. Even ones that seemed humane could not be trusted or believed. After a while it was like listening to a guard dog that barks at anything and everything. When you do need to heed the message you have become so numbed by the steady stream that you tune it out. I fear that 12 Years a Slave may have had that same affect to some and that is lamentable.",1402704000,,1242,4.311965811965812

6058678,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"This movie was great, for all of the reasons everyone else has mentioned. However, I have a few complaints which contain spoilers, so do not read on if you don't want the movie to be ""spoiled.""

Obviously the book is always better than the movie, but this is one movie I felt could be longer (yes, even though it is already 2hrs15mins) and should have been, so that it could include other scenes from the book. For example, Soloman Northup and the others plan to overthrow the slavers on the boat to New Orleans- not in the movie. Soloman also sends a letter while on the boat which DOES make it to his friends- not in the movie. Soloman tries to escape MULTIPLE times. He never stops trying. Also not in the movie. Ford (Cumberpatch) is portrayed as worse than he really was, and a large chunk of the Soloman-Ford-Tibbets/Tibault relationship is left out, which I feel would have significantly added to the story.

My biggest complaint is a lack of showing the time that has passed. Had I not researched myself and had the title not been ""12 Years A Slave,"" I would not know that he was enslaved for 12 years. I would guess 5-7 as he only aging to Soloman was a slight fraying of the hair. In fact, he was enslaved with Epps for 10 years (being under Ford for about 1 year and Tibault for about 1 year). Something as simple as flashing the date on the screen would have been very helpful.",1402617600,,1389,4.37984496124031

6058686,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"In general senses, slavery still exists.  Oppression of the powerful over the weak is despicable.  Metaphorically, people have inappropriately complained of being a slave to a corporation or the government, but this is presently only a loose comparison.  The sex trafficking around the world is a real example of modern slavery, but so few believe this to be a compelling problem that we mostly think slavery a thing of the past.

But imagine yourself as the main character Solomon.  He goes on a business trip and gets kidnapped.  Does this happen today?  He then finds his formerly civilized world is 10 million miles behind him and he is in very real bondage.  Would we be crushed immediately by the shock and trauma, or would we choose to survive?  What morals would our survival require us to compromise?  How much suffering could we endure?

I was most uncomfortable by this movie, because I kept asking myself what would I do in that exact circumstance?  In so asking, I looked at slavery from an entirely different perspective.  It seems presently impossible, but our democratic government could turn on another subset of civilians for arbitrary incarceration or indentured servitude.  There was a time that U.S. held Japanese Americans in concentrations camps and stole their property, out of the excuse of military security.  We believe that we have a constitution that protects us from such tyranny, but this constitution that guards our rights to real freedom is so vulnerable these days.  Perhaps we would all be required to join a military effort to defend our shores from invasion.  There so many ways that our entire universe could change almost over night, and we could find ourselves in very different circumstances.

If we watch this film and imagine ourselves in the main character's predicament, we very much heighten our appreciation of the freedoms that we presently enjoy.  Remember Freedom isn't free.",1402531200,,1926,5.037974683544304

6058700,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"Having learned of Solomon Northrup's story and others during Black History month in February each year of elementary school, I found it amazing the director Steve McQueen and most of those involved in the making of the movie had not. Although most would ignore the brutal stain on American History that slavery represents, Solomon Northrup's story was/is unique in that he was a free born educated and cultured Black man born and living in the American North at the time and yet he still wasn't safe from those who saw black people as a means to line their pockets, beds...etc. Although briefly, Director McQueen's movie is realistic in that it also touches on the issue of black people that were in semi positions of power over the enslaved as well. The whipping of a woman scene helped me to gain a new respect for the constant state of terror those living under American slavery had to endure each day. Although most are accustomed to thinking of the enslaved as victims, McQueen's movie and well as Northrup's original story shows that the owners, their families, those who worked for them, and others who perpetuated the system were as well. In the movie as in Northrup's original account in his own words, the owners, their family members, employees, and other system perpetrators seemed more the brutes they claimed their enslaved workers to be. Knowing that this was/is indeed a true story, the bittersweet nature of the final scene between Patsy and Solomon both broke my heart and haunted(s) my thoughts.",1402272000,,1514,4.872093023255814
6058701,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"This past week, I've been watching movies that were nominated for Best Picture. 12 Years a Slave was an intriguing true story about Solomon Northup who is a free African-American man in 1841 who is suddenly sold into slavery. He's stripped of his name and forced to work in the cotton fields and beaten on a daily basis. If you want a powerful story about slavery, you might enjoy 12 YEARS A SLAVE!!!",1402185600,,400,4.493150684931507
6058702,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"Not one to pay much attention to the Oscars, I often find a lot of the winners to be less than award worthy. 12 Years a Slave is a harsh film that doesn't waste any time getting to the meat of the story. It's frightening and brutal,  so depressing to think how barbaric our ways of society were and in some cases still are.

The story of how this free man's world is turned inside out is disturbing and mesmerizing, To think that our society thought like this not all that long ago is appalling and sadly we haven't learned or changed all that much in the passing 170 years. The Holocaust being an even closer reminder, but considering the barbaric things going on in the Middle East,  Al-Qaeda etc., it is obvious we have a long way to go (grow).

If you enjoy films like Schindler's List, The Pianist, The Color Purple, then 12 Years a Slave will not disappoint. It's a completely engrossing film that hits you in the gut. The Blu Ray looks great.",1402185600,,949,4.344632768361582

This story tells how mankind can and still is evil and oppressive when one class is in power and has overwhelming numbers. This true story tells of the dark age and dismal period when people believed that they could use bondage as a way of life in this country.

I am nit done with it yet I am still at the part where he is a slave picking cotton and going to the store for the master's wife, she has figured out that this is no ordinary man he can read and write, I get the feeling that in some way she will help him I the end.

6058773,1,B00G4Q3KOC,"I wanted to love this movie. Chiwetel Ejiofor has been one of my favorite actors since I first saw him in Amistad, and later, Dirty, Pretty Things, and of course, Kinky Boots. I admired his acting in this movie as well. There was much I admired in this movie. It was wonderfully crafted. It had an aura of total authenticity about it.
Then why only one star? A big part of my rating is that very authenticity. It was like watching a documentary. Except it wasn't documentary. It was a dramatization of one mans memoir published over 150 years ago. I personally believe that it was actually authentic, but I can just as easily see someone of the ilk of a Holocaust-denier or a climate-change denier claiming that its a hoax, that it was all made up. Conversely, I can see white-supremacist organizations using this film as a training reel for this is how THEY should be treated. I hated Django Unchained, and couldn't understand why notable actors appeared in that film, but I would rather watch Django Unchained six times in a row, than to have sit through 12 Years a Slave even once.
Since it is not a documentary, what is the point of this film? A film, especially, a Best Picture winner, should in some way illuminate and enhance the human condition. Is my condition enhanced because I would rather walk into a gas chamber in Auschwitz than live under the conditions these slaves were living under? I think not.
It is ironic to me that Chiwetel Ejiofor first came to my attention in the film, Amistad, a film that I believe SHOULD have won best picture, and remains one of the truly great American films. Amistad had its central section depicting the suffering of the slaves during their transatlantic voyage. I cant remember exactly how many minutes it went on, but it was enough. It conveyed the degradation, the suffering, the horror completely. We got it. We didn't need anymore. The rest of the film could deal with the struggle for decency and rightness.
Yes, 12 Years a Slave was authentic. It went on for two hours and 15 minutes. It would have been more authentic if it went on for 12 years. Should the film have been that long? Would it have added anything if it was? The filmmakers of 12 Years a Slave have made the well-meaning, but tragic error of making authenticity so important, they forgot that there has to be more to a story than unremitting suffering.",1401148800,4,2374,4.588235294117647

You come away from this movie wondering how these slaves withstood the beatings that they received (sometimes for no reason at all). Many of them never disagreed with their ""Master"", for they knew if they did, the beatings would only be more fierce and more severe!

As a story concerning racism...a travesty that reflects man's stupidity and hatred towards anything that is different than himself and his kind.

A travesty of our enlightenment of all of GOD's creations.

6058867,1,B00G4Q3KOC,"I cannot say how this could have come away with the coveted award of Best Picture at the Academy Awards and Best Supporting Actress as well as a nod for Best Writing of an Adapted Screenplay plus the many, many nominations it received but I can say why I think this film deserves an absolute thumbs down on all counts.  I did not find the film at all believable. I wonder if the adaptation at all resembled the book and also wonder if the director took liberties with the story line, for whatever reasons. There are so many questions and holes in the tale that I am loath to accept it as absolute truth.  The memoir, being written by Solomon Northrup himself, and published in 1853 was one I had never heard of or even heard mentioned before this film appeared. Northrup is our protagonist in the film. I should have thought this memoir would have been dynamite in its day, and even if that was too much to hope for given the year of publication, I would have thought that sometime after the bravos over ""Roots"" faded, this would have been made into a film, especially considering the issues of truth and authenticity that were being spoken of concerning Alex Hailey's saga. If this really was the real thing, it should have blown the roof from every complacent home in the land as well as give the vultures in Hollywood a wonderful opportunity to hear sounds of Cha-ching in their heads! I can but wonder why that didn't happen until now! The story goes something like this; Without noticeable protest from anyone, including his wife and children, a free, learned, musically talented and well respected black man from upstate New York is somehow kidnapped from Washington D.C. and sold into slavery after accepting a two week stint as a musician there.  We never witness how or are privy to why this occurred and we never see the reaction of his wife, family or of the community who seemed to know him so well.  What we do witness is the total humiliation, degradation and the foul, graphic and grave bodily mutilation meted out by the second of two of the new slave's masters.  This man seems to believe it his divine right to remove the flesh from a person's body for any perceived infraction. If his first owner could be considered somewhat of a Christian like man, this second and last owner is one from the absolute depths of hell who has never seen the inside of a church, let alone owned or read a Bible!  I have come away from this film having many more questions than answers and not especially empathetic to any of the people depicted here. I expected to come away feeling some degree of disgust and anger toward this country and my fellow white man but that hasn't happened.  If I feel any animosity toward my fellow man it is disgust of the highest order for those people involved in the film who subjected anyone to this degree of mindless and endless torture without reason and without the slightest character development or discernible story line.  I have no idea why or how this picture was made.  It didn't educate or enlighten in the least and it certainly didn't entertain or make me feel as though I had just seen a film of import. I bought this film not knowing anyone who had seen it nor did I know anything about it other than the images the title conjured up in my mind and the awards it had received. I had seen every important film or series dedicated to the issues of slavery and the plight of the African, colored, negro and black person in America. I have long felt that people have returned to classic film because there really are not very many important films made anymore.  Nor are there actors one is champing at the bit to see in a role. When I was younger it didn't matter what the film was...if a certain star was in it or a gifted director was a part of that project you'd see it without prior recommendation...and it was always good and, at times, even great! People talked about the films they had seen...not any more.  In any given year there were always movies that were wonderful and you couldn't wait for Oscar time so you could be a part of it all. I can remember very, very tight races for the top honors in several years during those fruitful years of film. Today, people tune into the Oscars to see who is wearing what on the red carpet!  Young people are turning to classic film by the thousands and there is are several reasons for it. You used to be able to go and see or purchase a film based on who wrote, directed or acted in it and be happy you did.  Even if you were bedridden for a year and couldn't get out to see a film the Academy Awards was the indicator of what was worthwhile...but, not anymore!  If this was the best 2013 offered then I'd hate to see the rest of the nominees. The acting was well done especially by the primary players but I believe John Ridley, who adapted and wrote the screenplay, and Steve McQueen, the director of this film, missed the point entirely. Where is the other part of this story that must have been equally as heartbreaking for this man's family and the community in which they lived and worked? As an aside, I'm still wondering how Alfre Woodard got to be rather the ""Grand Duchess"" in this film who sat on a porch one sunny afternoon or early evening, seemingly holding court with several slaves in attendance as she crooked her pinky while drinking a cup of tea and spouting some sort of strange wisdom concerning life! Where did she come from suddenly?  Yes...acting can be very good and even great...but if one has no idea of why the character exists or how they do...then it is all for nothing.  Film for sale!

6058869,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"Enjoyed the richness of this film in the locations, the way the feeling and visuals of the South were so beautifully shot. The story was interesting, bringing to light some of the challenges of the free people of color and existing slavery in South during this period of transition. The film was fairly well balanced in its characterizations and portrayal of situations that existed - as it explored the power dynamic and implications of this time. I read the book so the film is fairly true to form, however, I was confused at the opening of the film with some sort of ""love scenes"" transposed and then jerked somewhere into his story. This happened a few times and the transitions were not clear. Nor was it highlighted how hard this family had worked to achieve their success as ""free people"" and the agony they went through along with his friends trying to find and help him over the 12 years while Northrup was ""missing"".The film failed to really illustrate how the years were going by with some markers or indicators. Certainly he should have been more haggard and aging and his fortitude and despair could have been explored and apparent. Some of the supporting actors did not give great performances and weakened the film. But as has been said many times Chiwetel Ejiofor and Lupita Nyong'o were quite believable and remarkable. I thought the ending was weak... the family reunion should have been much stronger and emotional for the audience and Ejiofor carried the burden of forcing the emotion in this scene that should have been a tear jerker like ""The Color Purple"". I also thought that omitting the court case after Solomon Northup was recovered, was a big missing (Amistad did this much better), because it does illustrate that the U.S. was struggling with bringing laws and enforcing them at this time (both Black and White folks) and those have laid the foundation for civil right's issues that tie into the present day.",1400025600,2,1937,4.802395209580839

It gave me a much better understanding of white America's response to a ""black"" man as President. I wonder if the racists - of whatever colour learnt anything from this film? Is it not yet clear that a man is a man - all the parts are the same, blood is red. Colour does not define the man but hate and bigotry sure do. I am a Christian and I was horrified at the way the Bible was used to keep the blacks in subjection - and it is still happening in 2014.  This is one film where I became really emotional - the deception, the brutal treatment for no reason, the fact that a white man could not accept that a black man could have an opinion or that he could be more learned, intelligent or better educated.  Looking at America today - the more things change the more they remain the same.

My issue is not regarding the point he seems to make quite clearly: That selling humans is sub-human.  My issue is that he does damage to ""hope"" by portraying a world where sadism reigns and there is nothing that we can do either as the character of Prat or us as movie-goers observering Prat.

6058904,2,B00G4Q3KOC,"I had looked forward to renting this movie for quite some time. Chiwetel Ejiofor (Dirty Pretty Things)  is one of my favorite actors and the buzz surrounding 12 Years has been consistently stellar.

Unfortunately, for me the reality did not match the buzz. The movie is very formulaic, the characters are wooden, the dialogue is stilted and often seems intentionally obtuse. The end result is a movie that, in spite of its heartbreaking topic, comes off as aloof. In addition, the film's focus on extreme violence seems to come at the expense of character and plot development.

Finally, I found the movie's underlying message about race to be simplistic. Here there are white saviors and white devils, and blacks who generally have little to no ability to change their own lives. These are stock characters in the narrative of slavery in the US, but it would have been much more interesting to see the story of people who challenge -- in any way -- these stereotypes. In real life, Solomon Northrup lived on to reclaim not only his family and freedom, but also to work publicly against slavery in the years before the Civil War --  a fact that 12 Years a Slave discloses only in the movie's footnotes.

6058929,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"I recently read the book and knew the plot, but somehow the gruesome intensity of the experience of Solomon Northrup was unexpected. Though there have been other arresting films on the travesties of slavery, somehow this one achieved a unique emotional response. Perhaps it was due to the fact that Solomon was an educated, prosperous musician in the north until he was tricked into a situation that resulted in him being sold into slavery. His name was changed to Platt, and in order to survive he had to pretend to be uneducated. Mostly, he kept his head down and said ""yassah"" and ""nosuh"" in order to avoid the censure of his volatile masters.

The scenes in which he is lashed and humiliated are almost too much to bear. Every justification for slavery is trotted out and espoused by the white slave-holders, and each rings hollow and stupid. The slaves are made to strip naked, work in intolerable situations, be separated from their families, and dance at the beck and call of their masters. There's nothing new here in terms of exposing the inhumanities of slavery, but somehow the actors and settings provide a lasting impression that is unique.

The DVD extras reveal that the film was shot in a mere 35 days, which is astonishing considering the variety of scenes. The settings in the deep south are sumptuous and sensuous, providing a surreal backdrop to the insensitivities to the treatment of the slaves.  The screen play does not fully embody the complete story of Solomon Northrup but is nevertheless a memorable story.",1399593600,,1534,4.847328244274809

There always seems to be some new generation who think nothing of others but only of material gain and/or comfort.
The southerners could not imagine an economy without slavery.  Gradually the south had indentured servants replaced by slaves. This allowed better more efficient exploitation.  I related this movie to today's issues with sweat shops and sex slaves.
Another gut wrenching story  is the YouTube video on Rheba McIntire where she finds in a deceased  relatives ledger the notation of the profit made by selling a 2 year old black slave girl at auction.  That video also hit my heart and Rheba's with a vengeance. This movie will leave a lasting imprint on my heart and soul.

6058939,3,B00G4Q3KOC,"Alert: If you have not seen the movie there might be some spoilers

I must confess I did not read the book but was told the movie was great and worthy of the Oscars. I disagree on both counts. Was the movie good, yes, there is no doubt about it but so much history was left out that should have been delved into. The fact that free black men lived, thrived, were respected and even owned business without repercussion should have at least been given more than a few minutes on screen. And unless you pay attention or know history, it will leave you confused. As confusing as when he was taken and sold. It should have at least explained the reason this was happening and with frequency during a part of American history when Congress had abolished slave trading so that no new slaves could be brought in from around the world. The only way to refresh the slave population was to kidnap the free black men from the North because they would not be known in the South and once in the hands of slavers your previous life is pretty much over and were given a new name and forged papers. Our country was divided and while slavery was a brutal trade it was not well received in many places, some of them even in the south.

 Solomon Northup is  a freeman living in New York and highly respected violinist, has a loving wife and 2 beautiful daughter he adores.  Unfortunately he is tricked into a possible venture, drugged and sold. That too was downplayed and should have been given more attention since any family torn apart would have been devastated. Nor was there any mention of people and friends even trying to look for him which I am sure there were many.

After being stripped, hosed down and powdered(for lice) he is given clean, clothes and sent to a house where he and the other slaves are paraded like prize cattle for the shoppers to view. No amount of music(there is an all black orchestra playing soft classical music in the room) lace, wine or plates of hor d'oeuvres can mask the fact this is a slave market. It is a sad tragedy that many families were torn apart in the slave markets and this one is no different as a woman is bought but her two small children are taken away sold to others. If that scene does not grip you heart then nothing from there on will.  Solomon endured 12 hellish years as he tries to conform or be severely beaten, traded from one abusive Plantation owner to another. Even his name has been changed and if hints of knowing how to read could find him at the end of a rope. It is sad when one whom he trusted turns against him and is left to hang and children are in the background playing, hardened to the reality of their life and what could happen to them.

He does try to get messages out but finds that anyone that he might trust is in fear of being caught aiding a slave so he continues in his existence but he never forgets who he is or where he came from. During his last years as a slave, he meets Patsy, a beautiful young woman who is the object of affection of the plantation master. Of course this does not sit well with his wife since he does little to cover the lust he has for her. She becomes a target not only for the master and his sexual whims but the wife who transfers all her hate, humiliation and obvious lack of love from her husband to Patsy. Patsy suffers tremendously and her story should have been given almost as much time as Solomon's because her plight was just as devastating as was the plight of most black women during these horrible times. She was severely whipped just to show that she was not that favored to appease the wife. Was Lupita Nyong'o deserved of an Oscar... my opinion is no... while her performance was excellent it was not stellar and she received almost as screen time as the plantation owners wife whose performance was equally good.

Brad Pitt enters late in the movie as a carpenter who is building a gazebo and he makes no attempt to hide the disgust he feels for the owning of slaves. But he is also a lone white man that must keep most of his opinon to himself for it is a very dangerous place he can find himself in. It is while constructing the structure he learns that Solomon is quite the learned man. And eventually he learns just who Solomon is and decides to help.

Of course we know that Solomon is rescued after 12 years of enslavement, and the man that comes to his aid is a white man who dares to stand up to the Plantation owner and promises legal reprisal for his treatment, kidnapping and abuse of Solomon. And here in my opinion is the saddest part of the movie as Solomon is led away, once again a freeman and the other slaves, Patsy included watch him leave knowing that for them there is no escape, no one is coming to free them, no one is going to rescue them.

He is reunited with his family and even that I bittersweet for him. The telling of his story in the movie(I did not read the book) should be made required reading or viewing to school children of all ethnic groups. It is a part of our history that needs to be retold, never forgotten without political correctness ever entering into it. It should be a discussion that should be held in the classrooms and in the homes partly because slavery, buying and selling of humans, particularly young women of all ethnic backgrounds, is still very much alive in other parts of the world with no one doing much of anything to stop it or turn a blind eye.

Was it a good movie, yes.. a sad, tragic and unrelenting part of our country's history that should never be forgotten or ignored... but a movie that could have been so much greater.",1399507200,9,5602,4.334923664122138

6058986,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"Great movie that has stirred up much needed awareness about slavery in the US. We have to confront the fact that white people of the times were unmoved by these horrors, although many did fight very passionately to end it.  Maybe like today, it's mainly black people who go into the streets to protest the green light in the murder of Trayvon Martin.

The relevance has been emphasized the past couple of weeks -- with the US Supreme court denying the need for Affirmative Action, in spite of the extreme disparities in college enrollment that continue; with the repeated claims by ignorant white activists (like the ""folk hero"" Clive Bundy ranting how black people were better off as slaves); and then the public ""outing"" of Donald Sterling's plantation master's views of ""his"" black basketball players....

These on top of the two highly publicized cases of black youth murdered in cold blood by white men, who were not found guilty of murder... And outrageous incarceration statistics that show there has been mass incarceration of black men (and increasingly black women and Latino men) in the US for several decades.

SLAVERY IS NOT BEHIND US... Race based slavery is a defining part of the United States, where a lot of the foundation of its wealth came from,  and race based discrimination continues to be essential to keeping people divided and accepting a broken economic system that only benefits a handful. Very few benefit from this situation, but too many people accept it.",1399248000,,1486,4.928

The only reservation I had was in the scene where the Fassbinder character goes haywire on the female slave--but when I saw this film for the second time, it's about this character's guilt.

This is to sort of complexity that comes out in a film director who is gifted.

6058996,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"The film does not spare the audience's  feelings when it comes to the cruel and inhumane treatment accorded to slaves in 19th century America.  The dilemma of a man, once free,  duped, kidnapped and sold into slavery in the South is a sad expression of the insecurity of life even in the northern states.  Only at the end of the film, the titles point out that kidnapping and selling of free persons into slavery was a common occurrence.  Perhaps this was a consequence of the pressure put on the importation of slaves from Africa (mainly by the British), making it worthwhile for unscrupulous slavers to  go to the trouble and expense of  kidnapping  and selling  free people.  There is something of a moral dilemma in the film's stress on the injustice of a free man becoming a slave.  What about the men and women who were born into slavery or captured in Africa rather than New York?  The pathos of that situation gets only a brief nod in the hero's tearful farewell from those remaining on the plantation.  The acting in this film is outstanding, especially the leads, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and the lovely Lupita Nyong'o.  The direction and editing of this film, notwithstanding Oscar are not outstanding.  The transitions between acts are not well handled and many scenes seem static, lacking ""flow.""

6059020,3,B00G4Q3KOC,"This movie is based on a (allegedly) true story, and it moves me. There is in my family history that my family owned two slaves. They were part of journal entries, diaries, and in written records of the time. However, the stories of my family's slave owning experience were quite opposite of what was portrayed in this movie. I do not, my family does not - even back to those generations - feel that slavery was an appropriate institution. In the case of our family, slavery was an institution that was enforced for everyone, white and black. When General Ewing issued General Order #10 requiring the emancipation of every slave, our folks divided the farm in half to share with their emancipated slaves; but, GO #10 also forbade blacks to remain in the State - they were forced to move on. So like many others, the folks provided the best wagons and equipment available and all the supplies on hand to facilitate their travel. It is described as a very emotional and difficult time by both families. What I'm trying to express is that no one was in control. In the movie, slaves were portrayed in the harshest imprisonment, treatment, and torture on an on-going basis. I'm sure all these things happened to some slaves at some times, but it is difficult to see how it could endure on a constant and on-going basis. Slavery for the white masters portrayed in the movie was a business and the slaves portrayed were livestock. It seems inconceivable that any business owner would torture, injure, starve and disable any beast they intended to profit from it's sale or labor. The story may be true, I wasn't there, but this story, as portrayed, strains credibility. My family folks back then, agonized over the many issues and actions of the time; slavery being but one atrocity among a hell-scape of atrocities during the time. Movies like this, have so little space to compress such overbearing subjects that everything in such a movie loses the context of the times - and locations - and people. I can say that my family may have once owned slaves; but I can say that according to their journals, diaries, passed-down stories from generation to generation, I've never read or heard of anything even approaching what was portrayed in this movie. But that doesn't mean it didn't happen, just that those kinds of things didn't happen in the world that my family folks lived in.  Slavery as an institution, aside from the tortures, the starvation, the isolation, the violations - slavery of one person owning another is a moral and ethical wrong. The treatment of any creature, human or animal, as shown in this movie is as abhorrent and intolerable as anything man has done to man at anytime in the history of the world. That is the real lesson of this movie.",1398816000,2,2756,4.7060041407867494

 It starts off with a freeman named Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who lives peacefully and happily in Saratoga, New York with his wife and two children during 1841, 20 years before the Civil War, away from most of the violence and suffering of the South. Due to his skills as a violinist, now even his job seems to be getting an upgrade, as two young gentlemen approach him and make him an offer for his talents that he can't refuse. If he'll come and perform for them in Washington at a show of sorts, they would pay him a large amount of money (during the time).
Intrigued, he accepts, and they head off to the Capitol. Things seem bright and wonderful for Solomon, yet we as the viewers know this poor soul is not going to get the payment or anything else. During dinner (a lavish one at that) he ends up getting ill, and the two men help him upstairs to his room where they put him to bed...
When he wakes, he finds himself in a cell, bound in shackles and in the presence of slavers... he's been kidnapped.

Immediately, we see the brutality of the slavers in the South... from the moment he wakes (literally). And from that moment on, Solomon not only experiences the horrors of slavery for himself, but acts as eyes through which we see these things happen. The moment he steps off the ferry which transports him and many other slaves to the South, he is sold... and almost immediately afterwards, he ends up on the bad list of those slavers around him.... all seems hopeless for him.

The acting was absolutely superb from just about all the cast members... with special highlights for Lupita Nyong'o (who plays a slave girl named Patsey) and Michael Fassbender (playing a vicious plantation owner with grit and vigor). Both played their characters with such enthusiasm and determination, (or tragedy and insanity respectively) to the point that they became just as compelling - if not more so - than Solomon. That's no criticism of Ejiofor... he was fantastic. But it's just a testament as to the acting of these two supporting actors. Maybe it's because these characters are so much more charismatic than Solomon, who is always rather quiet and brooding throughout the movie.
As for the story... man it is sad. What makes it even sadder is the fact that this all really happened. Even IF the story Solomon didn't exist, slaves during that time really did have to endure this hardship... and what's worse is that many slave masters were like Epps... brutal and sadistic. There are so many things that happen in this film that I haven't even listed... and I shouldn't list it for the sake of NOT spoiling it for potential viewers. You really need to see it for yourself... and experience it as movie instead of a school project...
Yes, it has an R rating for a reason... there IS nudity, violence, and racial language. Should you watch this with the kids? I'd say no. Unless they're mature enough to view something like this.
But for those who ARE mature enough to stomach the reality of it all, like me and my bro, then I'd say this is a must-see (especially if you are in the middle of the Civil War history period like me). And it really does kinda play out like a deeper and more graphic History Channel episode... looking back it doesn't exactly follow a storyline that is able to be narrated effectively without giving to much detail... or too little. I'll stick with the latter so I don't spoil anything...

Are there any criticisms...? Hardly anything. Honestly. It is exactly what I expected it to be... and just as sad and tragic as I knew it would be. But it is history, and it isn't watered down for the sake of younger or softer audiences. And I like that. Even the typical Hollywood route of slavery stories in making the slave-master's wife kind and compassionate is avoided completely, as Epps wife (played by Sarah Paulson) though not as physically abusive, is just as cruel to her slaves as her husband - especially against Patsey for reasons that will be revealed in the film.
The ONLY irritation (yes, irritation not criticism)... and it's not even about the movie itself... is the predictable role that Brad Pitt chose for himself in the film. Not even really a ROLE (more like a cameo), as he plays a hired hand that doesn't have much screen-time and only comes at the near-end of the film, but is, of course, extremely righteous and stands up for the right thing and believes in the right thing. You'll see what I mean when you watch it. Let me just say this...typical Brad. I, personally, would've liked to see him play the evil slave-master and be just as menacing and insane as Michael Fassbender.

Ultimately, this is undoubtedly a five star movie. Was it enjoyable? Well, define ""enjoy""... I wasn't laughing that's for sure. Nor should I. It's not a comedy nor is it lighthearted. Was I touched by it? Yes. And I'm sure you will be too...",1398816000,,5354,4.566077003121748

The book provides you with  the insight necessary to understand the horrible nightmare that Northup found himself in. The movie did not have this effect on me and was very disappointing. There was little character development and when there was. such as in the case of Edwin Eppes,  the character came off as unrealistic and exaggerated.

I postponed seeing this movie because of the assumed violence that was supposed to take place on unprotected slaves.

How could you show the atrocities in a cinematic way to get the full impact of the event across without being so repulsive that your audience would turn away?

I know that seems an odd thing to say, but Hollywood's past is littered with well-intentioned dramas that, driven by the need to appeal to the widest possible audience, have filtered their racially- charged stories through the eyes of sympathetic white characters, who are there not merely to right moral wrongs and to alleviate the sufferings of the afflicted, but to make the audience feel better about themselves, secure in the knowledge that THEY would surely never have participated in anything so vile or unjust had they been there at the time. Not that that aren't a few ""decent"" slave owners around - ""decent"" being but a relative term here - but those who made ""12 Years a Slave"" have no intention of letting the audience off the hook so easily. As Eliza - a woman who has had her two children cruelly ripped away from her and sold to someone else - points out to a fellow slave when he begins to describe the plantation master as a decent man, no person who buys and sells other human beings as property can ever be described as decent or good.

""12 Years a Slave"" is based on the experiences of Solomon Northrup, a freeman living in New York who literally woke up one day in 1841 to find himself kidnapped, shackled and sold into slavery in the South. Northrup was an educated man, a farmer, a violinist, a husband and a father of two, but none of that was enough to protect him from the scourge of slavery that had imprisoned so many of his fellow black men and women in the country. Upon his eventual release, Northrup wrote a memoir entitled ""12 Years a Slave,"" chronicling his years in captivity, which has now been adapted into an Oscar-winning screenplay by John Ridley.

Among other things, ""12 Years a Slave"" is probably the most honest and unflinching portrayal of the realities of slavery ever captured on film, a reality that regularly included rapes, lashings, lynchings, the rending of families, and the non-stop degradation and de-humanization - all sanctioned by society and codified into law - of a whole race of people.

On a broader scale, the movie also conveys what it was like having to live in a constant state of fear that a mere look, word or gesture - or even the slightest hint of self-defense or standing up for oneself or others - could result in a beating, a flogging or perhaps even death. It also shows what it was like being constantly at the mercy of some racist overseer's mood or whim, with no legal recourse or hope for justice - and the despairing belief that it would forever be thus. That is the world McQueen brings so vividly to life in ""12 Years a Slave.""

The movie also portrays how slaves were often forced to turn on each other to alleviate their own suffering or perhaps improve their own chances of survival.

In a highly risky but ultimately effective move, Ridley has chosen to provide dialogue whose elevated diction and syntactic complexity sounds vaguely strange to the modern ear. Even the uneducated slaves talk in this manner. It's a bit unsettling at first, but it underlines just how dedicated these filmmakers are to exploring the truth. Also unsettling is the harsh discordant horn that blares at various moments of intense suffering or high drama throughout the film.

As Solomon, Chiwetel Ejiofor has the difficult task of bringing depth and wisdom to a character who is forced by circumstances to be reticent and passive. Yet, Ejiofor, in many small and subtle ways, allows us to see the man of strength and determination lurking behind the servile exterior. In a relatively small role, Lupita Nyong'o made enough of an impression on the Academy to walk off with the Best Supporting Actress Oscar portraying a young slave named Patsey, who may have found ""favor"" with the plantation master but who's life has become a living hell as a result. There are excellent performances as well by Michael Fassbender, Sarah Paulson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Adepero Oduye, Alfre Woodard and Brad Pitt.

Because the movie IS so faithful to the brutal realities of slavery, it has earned the rather unfair reputation of being ""too difficult to watch,"" a fact that may have limited the size of its potential audience both in theaters and at home. Let me just say that, for all its harshness, ""12 Years a Slave"" is no more violent or ""unmatchable"" than any number of movies or TV shows from now or the recent past. Not by a long shot. In fact, I can think of at least a half a dozen shows currently running on cable TV that are far more violent than ""12 Years a Slave"" is. So if this is the reason why you may have been avoiding checking out one of the finest films of recent years, you might want to rethink that decision and at least give it a try.

6059135,1,B00G4Q3KOC,"No I haven't seen this movie on Amazon and am not likely to. Amazon streaming has degenerated such that it is no longer a good way to watch movies in my Home Theater. I have twice now paid for a movie in High Definition but the movie was delivered in something substantially less.  Right now I'm considering renting it in a Blu-ray from from Netflix.

But even more importantly this film is about a trivial subject that has been hyped outrageously by political partisans. This movie is about a free black man being kidnapped into servitude. This was never a problem in America. If this particular case was legitimate it seems to be the only one. At this same time thousands of white men were routinely kidnapped and put into brutal servitude.

First let's consider if this one individual case is credible. At the time it happened - before 1853 - it was legal to import black slaves from Africa. But in this sensational case two white men concoct an illegal scheme to capture a northern free man of color and sell him as a field hand. One of the men involved in this case had formerly committed a popular fraud of the day that was  depicted  in the James Garner movie 'Skin Game'. White con men would sell a black confederate in the South and then later free him so as to do it all over again. The black man in this kind of con game was in danger of not being freed. And this is what some think happened to Solomon Northup.

We will never know the truth of it. Was it a real kidnapping or a con game that went sour? In a way it doesn't matter. If it was legitimate it was very unusual. If it happened the way it was portrayed in the best seller of 1853 it was a very rare crime. The two alleged kidnappers were caught but were not prosecuted. Some think it was because Northup and the whites were found to be partners.

But white kidnappings and enslavement were very, very common. In fact we went to war twice over white enslavement.

The British needed men to man their fleet. They adopted the policy of impressment. Press gangs routinely kidnapped able bodied white men from pubs and rooming houses near the sea. An impressed seaman had it worse than a black agricultural slave in almost everyway. They were treated worse. They were whipped more, ate worse food and worked harder, under much more dangerous conditions. They had shorter life spans. They were locked below decks when in port. They were not free.

Unlike black slaves impressed white men were often killed. Like soldiers in the Napoleonic British Army they were beaten to death as a lesson for the others. British soldiers and sailors could be sentenced to a thousand lashes. No man can survive that sentence . Typically the soldier would pass out and be revived day after day until they finally died. Field slaves were never treated that way. Black slaves were too expensive and hard to replace.

Impressed seamen ate salt beef, wormy dried biscuits and had little fresh water, Black slaves on farms ate much better and had far better housing. They also usually had wives and families. The average life span of an impressed sailor was only a few years. Sailing ships were very dangerous places.

The British only abandoned floggings in the late 19th century - decades after the all the black slaves had been freed.

I'm sure black slavery in the America South was unpleasant but it was nowhere near as unpleasant as the treatment that others of that day experienced.",1398124800,7,3433,4.555194805194805

It was new to learn about our internal slave trafficking between the north and south during that time -- appalling, actually...as much of our history is to me!  All in all, it was a great reminder of the horrible things humans did/do to other humans.

6059167,3,B00G4Q3KOC,As an African American this movie was extremely hard to watch. It's a reminder of the pain and suffering that the African slaves had to endure and why African Americans are still viewed as less than in this great country called America today.,1397952000,,242,4.651162790697675

6059173,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"Very important movie to watch. This movie was just a glimpse of what African Americans had to go through in the hands of White Americans. The government should provide some type of a reimbursement for torturing this race of people for so long. I really hate white people now.

6059177,5,B00G4Q3KOC,I could only watch this movie once. I know it's a true story but it's hard to look at and try to understand why slavery ever happened in the first place and why it went on for so long!,1397865600,,184,3.7435897435897436
6059178,4,B00G4Q3KOC,True to the book with minor exceptions. I'm glad there wasn't a music track. The quiet moments added more to the intensity of the events than music would have. What might have made the film slightly better would have been to give more sense of the timeline. Without the title you would not have had any idea how long he had to endure his plight.,1397865600,,345,4.323076923076923

6059184,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"This movie was done without all the 'hollywood' drama and extra graphics that might ruin a good film.  This film was done in good taste and kept decent and captivating.  I don't remember some of the scenes in the book I read and the movie would have to be much longer to include other narratives from the book.
Although my internet service is okay (AT&T), the picture quality was fine and satisfying.  I thought I should have ordered the HD version at one time but after a few minutes into the movie, I didn't notice any poor picture quality.  I like that Amazon picked up on more technical viewing problems; espcially  near the end, than I did, and sent me a refund for that.  They didn't have to do that for me.  Besides, I probably had too many tears in my eyes to even notice!  Great movie! Thanks Amazon!",1397779200,,809,4.382550335570469

6059194,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"well acted movie. i think the black people of the unitedstates were treated much worse than this movie shows,  i think the atrocities of the slavery occurredin this era should portrayed as it happened and not thru rose colored glasses.",1397692800,,235,4.875
6059195,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"Many of us never stop to think when confronted with the history of slavery, about what it would be like for someone like ourselves to be pressed into slavery. That is the premise of this movie about the kidnapping of an educated black man from the North who is abducted to a southern plantation where he must live the life of a slave. Once one places themselves in the situation that this man finds himself in, you begin to realize the inhumanity of the situation. This is challenging material and sometimes difficult to watch. In spite of this, I found the movie compelling.",1397692800,,575,4.592233009708738
6059196,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"I feel funny about saying loved it due to some of the disturbing and weighty scenes, however..
The big draw of it for me was in how it depicted the conflict from different perspectives. This movie did a great job of showing history and the different perspectives surrounding slavery.
Told through the eye of a free black man, you're watching this thing unfold... because we have always been told from a different eye... and it just makes you more aware.",1397692800,,453,4.675
6059197,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"Most of can't imagine what it would feel like to be enslaved. This movie which shows the experience of free man being forced into servitude shows even the strongest of people can be beaten down. The movie grabs you at the start and never lets you go.

6059201,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"I'm such a bleeding heart that at the end I was sobbing so hard it was ridiculous. The story was great and very interesting and apparently it was a real thing. It's definitely worth the watch. I mainly watched it for Benedict Cumberbatch who plays a kind master but just cannot keep Solomon. My only issue with it is there are a few camera shots where you're left wondering what the heck the director was thinking. In my opinion he was trying to be to artistic or something but I feel it just wastes time that could have been put to better use telling more of the story, or left out to make the movie a little shorter.",1397692800,,618,4.245762711864407

6059205,3,B00G4Q3KOC,THought this was a pretty good movie and story.  Harrowing tale and a good reflection of the realities of the slave trade but not as groundbreaking or historically encompassing as the original Roots series.  Michael Fassbender was by far the best actor in the movie - Brad Pitt's role was stunted and almost a guest appearance thing.  Worth watching but not as good as the oscars hype,1397692800,,384,4.701492537313433

6059212,4,B00G4Q3KOC,Worth watching when you are in a serious mood. Not sure how true it is but it is hard not to hate white people for being so evil. Then I think that this kind of evil goes on now in this world at the hands of all races. Love is great but love without justice is not real love.,1397606400,,275,3.6779661016949152

He had a sister also free, married to a mulatto man, they had six children.  One day a group of men came to the farm they owned and took the sister ( husband was not there) and the children and sold them into slavery.
Many years later one of the boys was recovered but the rest of the family was never found.
I had my DNA tested through a popular company and every once in a while a 4th or 6th cousin pops up who is black...and I wonder.

6059225,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"This movie was what Americans who are not of African descent needed as a precursor to the ""REAL HISTORY THAT NEEDS TO BE TOLD"". That long overdue untold history fact is ""THE BLACK HOLOCAUST"".  Many people on Earth either are not aware, or choose to turn a blind eye to this fact. Unlike the so called Jews of Europe who were murdered by Hitlers regime, over 1 Billion Africans were murdered by White Europeans during the beginning to the end of the Slave Trade. Write a book or make a movie about that!!!!

I suspect that the White Europeans ""would never"" admit of their evil deeds towards our African slave ancestors, let alone co-sign to make such a book or movie. Both Holocaust were unspeakably inhumane, but Hitler's extermination of the so called European Jews is in ""my opinion"", ""NO COMPARISON"" to the barbaric hideous atrocities committed against Africans during the Slave Trade, and long afterwards by White Americans.

The Jewish holocaust lasted the duration of WWII. The Black Holocaust continues to this day in the American legal justice system towards us so called Blacks/African Americans. Mind you no so called Black/African American person in America is 100% African/Black. We're all a mixture of African, Native American & European. A more appropriate definition of who we are reminds me of a Spanish word called; Mulatto. Which is what President Barack Obama and many other of us so called Blacks/African Americans really should be defined as, if we have to be labeled. Then label us right!!!!

But I personally rather be referred to as a human being. Which we all are on this planet and labeling us only keeps us divided and more easy to manipulate and control. WAKE UP HUMANS!!!",1397520000,3,1700,4.8517241379310345

6059227,3,B00G4Q3KOC,It seemed to concentrate on the horrors of slavery rather than telling the story. I would have preferred to see a film that had better continuity in the story line.,1397520000,,164,4.5

6059232,3,B00G4Q3KOC,This was a good movie but not Oscar worthy. In fact I ordered and started watching this before the Oscars and turned it off before getting 1/4 of the way into it. After Lupita was given an Oscar I decided to see what I'd missed. Nothing. I am so ashamed of the nudity. Offer some people money and they'll do anything.,1397520000,,317,4.213114754098361
6059233,5,B00G4Q3KOC,What an amazing story.  Painful and courageous and joyful while telling a story of the reality of slavery in our country.  Chiwetel Ejiofor did a powerful protrayal of a man who lost everything and when finally free was a stranger to his family who thouht him dead or permanently gone.  The ending had hope but it tore my heart apart to see how twelve years can change everything in a persons life. Slavery is horrible in every way and this honest portrayal brought back what we should never forget.,1397520000,,499,4.584269662921348

6059235,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"Excellent movie, excellent portrayal of the possibilities of the damages done to humans in the institution of slavery.  This particular story was somewhat unique but still portrayed extreme cruelty which existed.  Makes you wonder who ever thought up such a use of human beings.  Tremendous acting from all cast.",1397520000,,312,5.326530612244898
6059236,2,B00G4Q3KOC,"The acting was good I suppose but not to the degree that the actors deserved awards.
The story was sad and was too long.  It was nothing like I anticipated.  I thought more would have been achieved by the end of there lives.
I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",1397520000,,268,4.235294117647059
6059237,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"Few films -- if any -- offer viewers the powerful experience of what it meant to be enslaved, separated from family, in constant fear for one's life and helpless to do anything about it. This film does. It also depicts the occasional pangs of conscience that (minimally) discomfort the slaveholders. Hardest to watch were the scenes of Solomon strung up and teetering on his toes for hours in the hope of remaining alive, and of slaves' backs flayed open by the whip. The savagery of slavery needed to be depicted on film for the many who choose not to understand the heartlessness of such a system or the multigenerational legacy of slavery that America may never put to rest. I get that. But I can't watch this film again.",1397433600,2,724,4.62015503875969
6059238,1,B00G4Q3KOC,Watch the trailer and it'll save you the suffering you'll endure from watching the movie. They show you 2 minutes in the beginning of the man with his family and then the next 2 and a half hours are filled with torture scenes. Although he is freed in the end (as you probably already know from the movie title) it's not a feel good movie... it's a feel miserable movie that is really pointless. I'd rather read the history than watch this film.,1397433600,7,444,4.36144578313253
6059239,4,B00G4Q3KOC,It is rare to have a film that is true and interesting at the same time. Brad Pitt did a great job as producer of this true story staying true to the times and not gooping over the politically or not pollitically correct terms. After all this is all American's history.....no matter what color.  It also makes me more that ever convinced that everyone living here is an American and we only cause rifts if we describe ourselves by our blood heritage or skin color. If you were born here or took the oath to become a citizen you are American and therefore free. It is sad that that was not always true. Many in this country of all colors were slaves somewhere. This story brings home how blessed we all are to be born in a place described as one nation under God...Freedom for all.

From an artistic point of view, the scenes are incredible. All actors were on point.

From a historical & drama point of view, it's engaging, sometimes disturbing, but overall leaves you thinking about America's past.

6059248,3,B00G4Q3KOC,"Just in case you hadn't got the memo, this movie brings home the point as elegantly sledgehammer: white folk are bad. Very, very bad.

Prepare yourself for 2 hours of cartoonishly diabolical white people being cruel to black folk. Once Ejiofor crosses the border into the South, you will encounter one - just one - white person who is a decent person (played by producer Brad Pitt), and one other who is not downright evil. The movie is so unsparing on the whip that there isn't even a Steven type black character (the Uncle Tom character in Django) to minimally counterbalance this hateful representation of those danged white folk.

If you can put the white bashing aside, this is a good movie. Cwhiwetel Ejiofor puts in a very sympathetic performance fully deserving of an Oscar, the white slavers are played with relish by the appointed actors, and the film paints a moody and textured image of life on Southern plantations during the era of slavery.

Hopefully this gets the trendy white-bashing out of Hollywood's system and we can look forward to a more nuanced examination of history and inter-racial interactions in the future (Terrence Malick's The New World was a step in that direction) - I'm not holding my breath though.",1397433600,,1234,4.838862559241706
6059249,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"12 Years a Slave is a film that is tough to sit through, not just because of its subject matter, but because of the way it is presented. Based on 1853 memoir Twelve Years a Slave by Solomon Northup, and directed by Steve McQueen of Shame fame, the film is a historical epic with the directors overtly artistic style. Despite some unconventional methods that I think are unnecessary here, 12 Years a Slave is a success as a drama thanks to the superb performances from the players.

The film covers the harrowing twelve years where Solomon Northup, happily married father of two children living in New York, is abducted and shipped to New Orleans, where he is re-named Platt and sold as a slave.

That the film is episodic is understandable, considering the nature of the source material, but the overuse of cinematic techniques including flashbacks, close-ups, jump cuts and long takes sometimes undermines the impact of the story. The film is most effective when these techniques are least conspicuous.

What makes the film so intense is the excellent performances from Chiwetel Ejiofor as the protagonist Solomon Northup and Lupita Nyong'o as the female slave Patsey. I prefer a more conventional linear narrative, but the strength of the story still remains intact for the most part.",1397433600,2,1286,4.944444444444445

I wouldn't allow children 12 years and under to watch this because I don't believe they could truly understand how horrific the buying and selling of human flesh really is and it's still happening today. Also there is a lot of blood and pain involved w/whipping, etc.

Solomon probably did have sex with women during his twelve years as a slave.  I felt opening the movie with that scene, with no set up, was an attention grabber.  I also think the director should have done a better job of setting up the life Solomon lived before he was a slave.  As horrible as slavery was depicted in the movie, the original narrative did a much better job of conveying the desperate life a slave lived.  The narrative really made me think of accounts of concentration camps.  Physical and sexual abuse, starvation, families split apart, and never knowing when you would die. Being owned, treated like and animal and having another person having absolute power over you.  If I hadn't read the narrative by Northup I don't think I would have gotten as much out of the movie as I did.  As they say, many a movie has ruined a good book.

It's not for the light of heart, or those wanting pleasant afternoon entertainment.  This movie is not entertainment; it will wrench your heart and leave you with hard questions about mankind.  How could Americans treat people with such hatred? How could hearts be so callous? Where does such inhumane evil come from?

And then, the realization dawns that this evil is not gone from the world.  It still exists in various forms around the world.  And I, as much as any other person, could be the one who is suffering, as Solomon Northup suffered.  There's only one thing to do.  Take up the cause of the Solomons around the world, and fight evil with the pure, selfless love of Jesus Christ.  By loving the people in front of us, and seeking out the broken to bring hope, we can overcome even the most unworldly evil.

Was she drawing fresh breath into her religious beliefs by repeatedly participating in a bloody reenactment?  Did it make her come to love Jesus more when she heard the never ending cracks of the whip upon raw meat?  Or, did she enjoy feeling her arm hairs bristle while in the company of revisited villainous evil?

There is so much wrong with the structure of this movie, such unbalanced acting and characterization and finally, such thin and unconnected plotting, that I found myself drifting off at times. This should have been called ""Staring: The Motion Picture."" This is two hours of people STARING meaningfully, dramatically and tearfully, though rarely crying. It all feels hugely cold, technical and motivated by off-camera direction rather than heart -felt drama rising organically from the actors and writing. And the writing itself, while not bad, flows illogically at times, as though whole scenes were cut to leave us a dispirited hodgepodge of demo-reel moments. If that wasn't enough to undermine this effort, then stand by for dreadful ponderous scoring and some of the worst photographical decisions since The Color Purple. 12 Years a Slave breaks far too many rules for good story-telling to succeed. It's rarely engaging and floats on a laden log of assured racial respect, but little of it is earned. Perhaps it's a little less self conscious than The Help, but not enough for me to call it a good movie. Lupita Nyong'o won an Oscar for making boo-boo faces during rape and whipping scenes and staying mostly dry-eyed throughout. Somehow that's good acting.

Cinema is not meaningless entertainment. There are others who have called this film `a torture porn'. Such degenerates have to know what a good book or a good cinema is compared with the junk that they see on the torture porn sites and sado-masochistic websites.
Hats off to Brad Pitt for going ahead and producing this film out of the book written by Solomon Northup and how cruel fate was to him in the 1841 Saratoga New York life. He was a free man who was abducted with deceit to be sold in the slave market. He survived for twelve years and this account truly deserves the best picture Oscar. Chiwetel Ejiofor also deserves the best actor. If I were in the jury, I would have given my nod to him than Matthew McConaughey for the Dallas Buyers Club. Hans Zimmer's musical score is riveting and haunting. I would not give much marks to Steve McQueen as a director but Chiwetel added intensity in the film along with Michael Fassbender.

But the lack of mainstream heroism and resolution in this movie disturbed me. I wonder if the film had to be directed and narrated the way it did... I'm utterly haunted by Eliza's character, and I'm left wondering whether or not Steve McQueen did her tale justice...",1397001600,,528,4.75
6059332,2,B00G4Q3KOC,"If all you know about slavery (and Jim Crow) is what you learned in public school, it's safe to say you don't know anything about either, really.  This movie isn't going to fill in the blanks (the book, on the other hand, is a different matter entirely).  The more I learn about both, the more I have to wonder if anything I was told about America, growing up, was true.  Slavery isn't merely a ""regrettable chapter"" in American history; it's a primary and integral aspect of our history and national character, and as such, a deformity every bit as unappealing to the eye as missing or deformed limbs, or a severely scarred face.  This movie doesn't tell you about slavery, it distills the brutality, and the cruelty, and the misery from the book, leaving all the history, information, and especially the subtle distinctions of the book aside, like some sort of chaff.  What you end up with is a beautiful cinematic ordeal, 2 hours or so of almost unending and near-pornographic violence.  A white viewer might allow that he needs to endure it to ""understand"".  If that's your view, read the book.  Pretty much every white actor in the slave section of the film seems to have been cast because of the sharpness of his features, beady eyes, and his ability to hold a sneer.  Everyone, even the slaves, are little more than stick figures given one task, either to be brutally cruel, or to evince suffering.  You'd never know that Solomon Northrup said (if slavery were the only option, presumably) that if he had his family with him, he'd gladly have spent the rest of his life on Mr. Ford's plantation.  You'd never dream that Northrup's view of Slavery sounds today like that of a Berkeley liberal, when talking about slavery as an institution so utterly corrupting and deforming that the slave owners couldn't really be blamed for their cruelty, as the system itself made them cruel.  To illustrate this he gives the reader some incidents of white-on-white violence, including knife fights so nasty the combatants seem like animals.

But not in this movie.

This movie is almost 2 hours of inhuman cruelty and brutality, paired with suffering and misery.  The difference between Ford and the more dastardly slave owners is portrayed as slight at best.  The wives and kids are merely background props, and we get nothing of the background of the slaves---Northrup wasn't the only freeman kidnapped and sold into slavery, when he was taken in D.C.  You learn nothing of cotton cultivation and harvest, let alone cane cultivation and harvest.

And nothing of course on the larger issues;  That Slavery existed as it did, and Jim Crow was as intense as it was, not because of some moral defect in the Southern makeup, but because the Southerner tends to express in public what most of us in the rest of the country would only mention cautiously, and then in the most private of circumstances, if then.  We may never use a racial epithet to describe black people as a group---""such a southern trash tendency"" but in fact most northern whites saw the division of labor and wealth along race lines as perfectly natural, and never thought to question it, until forced to do so.  So what does it matter what words we use, or avoid?

If you saw this movie, you really should read the book.  It won't be the ordeal you might expect, and you'll learn so much more even if your dismay about the nation's shortcomings is not abated by having done so.  If you haven't seen this ridiculous work, I suggest you skip it and read the book.  Other good works on the subject of slavery includes ""Black Cargoes"" by Mannix/Crowley, and an interesting parallel to ""12 Years A Slave"" is ""Skeletons On the Zahara"" about a Yankee ship looking for slaves that runs aground on the west coast of Africa, and it's mostly white crew is captured by bedouin tribesmen, stripped naked (clothes are valuable) and enslaved----if you think you've had a sunburn, you have no idea how bad it gets!  In other words, there are a lot of books out there that will bring you up to date on this horrible period in American history, without wasting your time on a film that puts all its eggs on a very violent cart that goes nowhere.",1397001600,10,4188,4.6716621253406

All slavery of any kind is unjust but the way the story is told, I saw that some people had somehow aclimated their lives to the point of accepting everything somehow.  This movie let me see the strength, tenacity, honor and endurance that can be developed in one person's life.  This is a worthy that is definitely worth seeing...it is emotional and sad but is the story of slavery from a different view of a slave.

Directed by Steve McQueen and crew, this is definitely one of the very best films to come out in recent years. 12 YEARS A SLAVE is expertly filmed and gives an immediate recreation of the antebellum South. The acting by just about everyone is similarly outstanding, with special kudos going to Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northrup, Sara Paulson as Mistress Ebs, Lupita Nyong'o as Patsey, and Paul Dano as Tibeats. This film truly captures the barbarity of slavery in America and slavery in general: The empathy with its victims is disturbingly keen. Scenes such as that of the mother being separated from her young children at the auction are realistically heartrending. This film is also revealing of the Biblical justifications that slaveholders often used and the frequency with which female slaves were raped by plantation owners and overseers. At the same time, however, all of the characters are well-rounded. Without sugarcoating anything, 12 YEARS A SLAVE portrays even the cruelest of its subjects as eminently human and shows the varying degrees of humanity and inhumanity among slaveholders. Plenty happens, with a number of reversals and surprises, but, as in many intelligent dramas, there isn't any one defining climactic moment. There are one or two vague spots, and the sheer number of characters can be confusing.  There are also many of the  oversimplifications that we inevitably get in a two-hour film about a very complicated subject, e.g., it seems to suggest that the northern states, unlike the backwards slaveholding south, were completely non-racist and progressive in their thinking and practices, which was, of course, hardly the case. Regardless, while this story has been told before in a number of earlier films, it's still told very well here.

As important as its subject may be, however, 12 YEARS A SLAVE is not just a film about slavery in America during the 1800s. It's about the will to power and the will to survive, human greed, human dignity, human guile and deception, and many other complications that occur between members of the human race. While it never stops to preach, the psychology of it all is powerful stuff, and there are characters in whom any modern person will find her/himself. As odd as this may sound, anyone who's ever worked at a job where they were treated disparagingly or been pressured to downplay their level of education and intelligence in order to avoid offending their ""superiors"" should immediately identify with the plights of Solomon Northrup and the other slave characters.

Still, if you want to just watch it for the story and don't feel like analyzing its many themes, you may easily do so. 12 YEARS A SLAVE is just a very fine, perhaps even great, drama, the sort that can be watched again and again. If you enjoy this film, I might also recommend 1997's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amistad/dp/0783231202/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amistad</a>.",1396915200,,2982,5.2301255230125525

Whoopi Goldberg didn't even get an award for the Color Purple and in this film the beautiful star did little more than show suffering and sadness.  Just didn't see the performance that deserved that award here.  The story was well written and I believe the acting was above average but over all this was a sleeper for me.  The cruelty displayed was just so hard to view and shows just how sicking people can be when they feel they are the boss.

This movie is at times very cruel to the unfortunate slaves. I will not provide spoilers but the ending is quite touching.

Almost all the blacks that live in the US are white-blacks.  Heck, for all I know I'm white-black.  Get over it!

I'm getting very tired of reverse racism in this country.  So, Jay Z, take your 'Five Percent Nation' medallion and get out of the country if you think whites are wicked and weak.  Are you white-black Jay Z; then you too have a wicked and weak side?  So go beat up an old white woman like the rest of your racist brood.",1396828800,5,743,4.444444444444445

Adapted from an autobiography that I have not read, a ""real book"" rather than a comic strip or graphic novel,12 Years a Slave is an outstanding film covering a subject of import. Not just for America, but for any nation that permitted slavery to exist within its borders. The acting, direction and cinematography are among the very best. And in another year, this film would stand head and shoulders above its competition. The bluray I purchased is well authored, the extras are interesting if not all that illuminating. (For illumination see the extras of Gravity, Rush, or Nebraska.)

But for me, this was a movie whose time had come ....... and past. Intentionally, I didn't see it in the theater. Had it not won the Academy's Oscar, I might not own it. It isn't Schindler's List.

It really did not touch on the emotions I was expecting the subject matter to touch on. It lacked something and I can not put my finger on it. I think first and foremost the costumes lacked for the times, the casting wasn't done write because the actors seemed to be holding back or just didn't have what it took to be as ruthless as the southern slave owners were in those days.

What I got was a film with unbelievable, stilted Elizabethan dialogue, sensationalized, stereotyped brutality and a wretched, disappointing  plot line. These characters don't talk to one another, they recite in Shakespearean prose. Who talks like this, black or white, then or now?
All this movie accomplished was to aggravate racial divide.
Of course there was brutality and abuse, but if it was as blatant and overdone as was shown here, the slave population would have been simply wiped out by the owners who needed them to function in that agrarian society.

6059454,1,B00G4Q3KOC,"This is one of the most hyped up movies I've ever come across. I thought this would be a great film and I was so interested in seeing it. Unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations. So many people said this movie was powerful, emotional, and touching. Well I've seen tons of slavery movies and this one was one of the most ineffective I've ever seen. If anyone has seen Roots then they most likely will agree that 12 Years a Slave is nothing new. Roots and countless other slave films before this were ten times better in my opinion. I think one was just too Hollywood for my taste. Most slavery movies have been independent or TV films so maybe that was part of the charm. I saw this as a big blockbuster slave movie and it just didn't do it for me. The acting was okay but there were many weird and extremely boring scenes in the movie. Some scenes should've been cut because they slowed down the film instead of moving it along. Also the film spent more time on supporting characters than it did on the main character. I love slavery movies and I think it's important for people to watch them to get a sense of history but I did not see why people claimed this was so great and certainly don't see why it won an Oscar. Then again, other movies have won Oscars I couldn't see why as well.

And before someone comes along and tries to say I'm racist or just don't understand the experience, I'm BLACK and I still did not like this movie. Sorry but if someone wants to see a slave movie they need not look any further than Roots which is by far the best ever made in my opinion.",1396656000,28,1587,4.220394736842105
6059455,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"I generally avoid movies that deal with slavery, because I usually want to inflict the same torture upon the slave owners that they inflicted on the slaves, which makes for a non-enjoyable film experience. But, I wanted to give this film a chance, and see what all the hype was about.

I did extensive research into the violence I would be witnessing, and it was fairly typical for the time period, which equals strong brutality. For those with weak stomachs or strong dislike of any kind of violence, I recommend you find another movie. I was surprised at the low amount of violence I watched (having seen much worse in other movies I had to watch in high school), until that scene involving the female slave, which disturbed me. I also do not recommend the film if you are averse to the use of the N-word (as I am, but I tried to put aside my feelings for the sake of trying to enjoy the movie).

Having read Solomon Northups autobiography, as I watched the film 12 Years a Slave, it was evident much of the dialog and setting for the films reenactment remained faithful to Mr. Northups brutal account of his captivity.

6059464,1,B00G4Q3KOC,"This film was horrible. The acting was terrible. People were either over acting or just plane bad. This film attempted to be moving but was anything but. The history of slavery in the United States deserved far better than this farce.

This film is not history. This film is propaganda. It is not history if history is rewritten to suit some preconceived notion the way some wish things had been. This film in itself was a farce. Hollywood only makes such films to fuel modern hatred which very sadly is profitable.

This book was dedicated to Harriet Beecher Stowe author of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Uncle Tom's Cabin also being a complete work of fiction. Being of course that Harriet Beecher Stowe had never set foot south of the Mason Dixon line in her life. It cannot be verified that 12 years a Slave's author had ever actually been a slave. Being of course that most abolitionists like Harriet Beecher Stowe had never been to the South and had never actually viewed slavery in person. This book more than likely was written to stir up anti-slavery sentiments in the North just prior to the Civil War. It was nothing short of propaganda then and it is the same now.

The truth is that what is known about the daily lives of slaves has only recently started to be researched. This is in large part due to the difficulty of archeology is the Southeastern United States and the lack of written records from anyone other than slave owners. Sadly this means that there is a less than accurate picture of what slave life truly was like. Up until the last thirty to forty years what was known about slavery was either of happy well treated slaves to something like this film. Both which would have been inaccurate.

What is known is that most slaves lived on small farms rather than large plantations. Generally 4-6 slaves with a single white family owning them. The white family would be working in the fields next to their slaves. This being done for the purpose of increasing their farms out put. Slaves were there for the purpose of augmenting labor. The idea that this labor force would be beaten regularly would be hard to believe. This is due to the fact that the  purpose of owning slaves was to make money. If a slave was injured or killed it would mean that the slave master would loose income.

Films like this do nothing to perpetuate what actually tragically occurred on a daily basis for these people. To portray this film as being history rather than fiction does not do justice to history or more importantly the slaves themselves. I know films have to be sensational to make money. Sensationalism is not fact.",1396569600,6,2619,4.609442060085837

6059506,1,B00G4Q3KOC,"First, let me say that the book this movie is based on is amazing.  If you have not read that, then I highly recommend it.  I believe this movie dishonors the author by distorting his story so drastically that it is barely recognizable.

Solomon Northup set out to give an accurate picture of what slavery was like from his experience having been kidnapped and held as a slave for twelve years.  Northup was actually contrasted with Frederick Douglas in that he did not speak of slaves running around naked.  Obviously, the writers of the screenplay did not share that approach.  Patsey was not the main character in the book and yet this almost appears to be her story.

My impression of this movie is that they took the story line from the book and tried to make another movie showing how terrible slavery is.  And make no mistake, the book accomplishes that goal as well.  Unfortunately, the movie dwells on some minor events at the expense of some of the most exciting moments in the book.  In fact, the events surrounding his rescue are so vaguely covered that they fail in immense fashion to express the magnitude of the excitement involved in the book.",1396483200,25,1159,4.637254901960785

I had to change my regional DVD zone to 1 (it was 2 before) and I can only do this a limited number of times.

This movie could be used to torture someone. The movie itself had potential because the story sounded interesting. For a non stop load of time its just about people suffering. THAT IS IT. There is no character development whats so ever, even the main character is a dull. This movie puts one into a steep depression, the movie is nothing but misery. The ending wasn't even satisfying, because the movie just dragged out. History is great, and without it the world would just be one big bubble of ignorance. But the 12 Years A Slave is no history lesson. Its just cliche, and unnecessary. Have the craving to watch a good movie about slavery or even series? Watch Roots.

Strangely enough, Brad Pitt who produced it , also had a very brief part...and it was the best part in the movie.  It didn't give me any less sense of grief than Roots did in its day..they both had deeply defective evil men and women portrayed with seeming conviction! I suppose it deserved best picture. It was no better or worse than American Hustle which was much more imaginative. But the major thing I got from it was the difference between 2 black directors. Lee Daniels ---who is full of himself and did the Butler and Steve McQueen who valued the story.. huge difference!! Like comparing Martin Scorcese and Tyler Perry!!",1396396800,,763,4.528985507246377

It seems to me that the real story here is the arbitrary difference between slaves and freed black people, which is a story that is completely glossed over.

I was left wondering why this movie won an award.  I think it was the story behind the movie that caused it to win an award.  In my opinion, ""Roots"" miniseries is still the best at telling the story of slavery.  I DO understand that this movie in particular is about a man who was born free, kidnapped, and then forced into slavery.  However, I just did not think that this movie really did the actual story itself justice.  I felt like the story could have been told in a different fashion.  But, I will say, if you are hearing about this movie (like I did), and you are curious, go ahead and rent it to cure the curiosity:)",1396310400,,782,4.272108843537415

This amazing story reminded me a lot of ""Roots"" movie in the early 80's. And like that movie it had a great story to tell and an amazing cast and supporting cast in it.

Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Giamatti and Brad Pitt among others make appearances as characters that you will remember.

To me Lupita Nyong'o (Patsey) steals the show with her dramatic performance along with Fassbender (Epps) who does the role so well that you truly hate the character.

Not to shortchange Chiwetel Ejiofor whose strong performance throughout the whole film carries the story with the horrors he sees through his eyes.

In so many ways like the Roots movie, which told the story of the generations of slaves, and became a classic, this movie is sure to become a classic as well.",1396310400,,923,4.569696969696969

Although there is salvation and a happy ending for the hero of this flick,  this outcome distorts the reality of that era just as much as the brutality and injustices relentlessly depicted in the movie.

Lord, even though I was not of that generation, I am ashamed that my race did horrible acts of violence against such innocent and sweet people. We can't take back history as much as most white Americans of today would like to, but we can and should ask God everyday to forgive us our sins and deliver us from the evil of bigotry.

What really happened was far more interesting and even more brutal than the movie.  I cared so much more for the people in real life than in the movie.  I was looking forward to watching this with my (older) kids as a teaching moment.  However, because of the rape scene and the ""scene"" at the beginning, I won't.  These event weren't mentioned in the book, why add them to the movie?  The brutality in the book is enough to give us an idea how bad the slave owners were without having to add rape scenes.

I really believe Solomon Northup deserved a much better movie than this.  He was so much more kind hearted and intelligent than the movie depicted.",1396224000,3,803,4.3

He is tricked into traveling to Washington DC where he is sold to a slave trader and moved to a plantation in Louisiana. The movie is violent and gruesome in its depiction of the life of a slave and the cruelty is overwhelming.

I liked the movie and it is well worth watching. That being said I did not think that the young actress that won the academy award was not in my opinion the best actress of 2013. Chiwetel Ejiofor who played Solomon certainly should have been a leading candidate for an academy award.

The movie is well done but many of the topics presented have been shown in other excellent films that expose and depict slavery. The key thing in this one for me is that a free black man was kidnapped in the north and taken into slavery for 12 years and he barely was able to gain is freedom was a new twist for me.

There are vague attempts to place the story in a historical context which has none of the details to support it -- everyone is dressed far too cleanly and nicely, for example. The manner of speech among the slaves is also not true to life - although some did have education and were kidnapped into slavery, most had no education at all and their speech was a gemisch of western African and English. There is very little authenticity to the backdrop, many of the characters are poorly developed and there is far too much lapsing into extremes, robbing the movie of a truly authentic voice. I am not talking about the torture scenes, either, those are probably the most authentic scenes in the movie. The problem is everything else. Slave owners were in some cases sadists, but many were far more complex, like Thomas Jefferson. I hope someone like the Coen brothers takes on this challenging topic and does it justice.",1396137600,,1154,4.579710144927536

The fact that it is based on actual events does not save this movie.  I have no idea what the Academy Awards were thinking, other than wanting to reward a movie that took on a tough subject.  They certainly were not rewarding a good movie with good acting.  It felt more like a cartoon than a docudrama.  If you rent/buy it anyway, bring a pillow.",1396137600,9,493,4.362637362637362

Although many may have been like that was it a fair depiction of the slave age as a whole? I am not excusing slavery which was an abomination but I guess we are making a movie and there are points to make.
My main disappointment was the picture quality: I felt the colour was over dark and blue and the resolution seemed soft with the focus not as sharp as I would have liked. Despite these comments this is a very powerful film well cast and acted.

Saddening to be reminded how barbaric human beings can be and that even to this day there is racism and cruelty in all parts of the world.  I disagree with people that have left comments saying that we should forget and move on because slavery happened along time ago.

Not to see if, is to  rob yourself of some of the most amazing acting and writing i have seen in a long time.  This movie is not just about slavery, it is about freedom in the midst of the horror.  It is one black man's quest to return to his family and the freedom he so fully enjoyed before money hungry, inhumane individuals kidnapped him and tried to make him nothing more than a piece of property...a thing.  !2 Years....was not predictable.

6059609,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"if you know what Spielberg's epic brought to the Jewish Holocaust and Nazi atrocities of WW2, then you understand what McQueen's done with this movie.  I also to refer back to another fave movie of mine to see if McQueen had directed it since it had very similar camera work.  nope, that director's name is Paul Thomas Anderson and the movie is There Will Be Blood (ironic reference I know), but oddly it also stars Paul Dano, who was perfectly cast in both of these films.

i must add, I also found this film hard to watch.  not because of the content so much (I am familiar with slavery), but because it wasn't what I was expecting.  I hadn't read a review or anything.  I don't think I ever saw the commercial for it but twice tops.  the only thing i was really aware of was all the pre/post Oscar buzz and that it starred some of my favourite actors, Ejifor (American Gangster, Inside Man), Fassbender (300, Inglorious Basterds), Pitt (Inglorious Basterds, Benjamin Button), Giamatti (Private Parts, Saving Private Ryan), and that's about it.  i guess maybe i was expecting it to be sugar-coated...?  well it's no Amistad, Color Purple, or Django Unchained that's for sure.

an interesting anecdote.  back from when Schindler's List had first been release to home video (1994), i remember a friend's mother who happened to be German, wasn't able to watch that movie 'cause of what it represented.  i didn't fully understand it at the time.  not that she had anything to do with those atrocities, she had actually fled Germany during WW2 and married an American serviceman.  now i see more clearly.",1396051200,,1601,4.712230215827338
6059610,3,B00G4Q3KOC,"for the most part this film was very good, but i don't think it deserved best picture. The story focuses on ""Solomon Northrup"" (chiwetel ejiofor)a free black man from upstate New York who is abducted and sold into slavery for 12 years.  The entire cast's acting was excellent, how they Portrayed the slaves' life's on the plantation farms in pre-civil war America and revealing The punishment and injustices they suffered every day at the hands of the plantation owners and confederate society as a whole was riveting and realistic.
The stand out performances in this film is are by Michael Fassbender who plays one of the mean tempered plantation owners who forces his will on the slaves and even his own wife! One of the most memorable scenes is where he stands before the newly arrived slaves for the first time and imposes his bigoted attitude on them while quoting scipture from the bible about how african slaves should be treated by their white superiors and how they will undoubtedly suffer if they don't conform and obey!
The second most memorable portrayal in the film is by ""Paul Giamatti"" who plays the slaver ""theophilus Freeman"" that brings the slaves to market for the plantation masters to purchase. He totally captures the role with nauseating realism, and definetley one of the best performances of the film!
 But what is disappointing is how the director has left out Solomon's family from the story line for the most part.  There were no parts of the film to show how they were affected by his abduction.  What lengths they must have went to to find him or what their lives were like in his absence.
all in all, those who sit through a movie and watch it from an entertainment point of view will probably enjoy it.  However those who listen to the script of the actors and intently watch the film from an objective point of view will most likely give it no more than three stars as i have done.",1395964800,3,1914,4.650887573964497

This movie is soooo moving, and makes you cringe and feel sorry for blacks back then, and now. There was no reason to abuse a human being, regardless of race, such as people like EPPS did, as long as everyone would do their work/job.  I hated the southern mentality of playing GOD, that they believe whites were superior, and white owners could do what they want with a human anyway they wanted, including whipping, which made me feel sorry and cringe at watching. I recently also purchased the book, as the book goes more in depth. I HATED SOUTHERN WHITES AFTER WATCHING ""ROOTS"" ONLY 5 YEARS AGO, AND NOW WITH THIS MOVIE, I REALLY HATE southern WHITEY!  I WISH I COULD GO BACK IN TIME AND ERADICATE SOUTHERN RIGHTWING ABUSIVE WHITES!  Even in today's world, prejudice reins down in the Southern states, particularly Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Tennessee, Georgia, etc.  I know, as I know a black girl who lives in Mississippi and says the towns there are segregated.  And the South still has that stupid Confederate flag, as they cannot get over that they lost!  So we should start a second CIVIL WAR!  I am there!  Eradicate all prejudiced whitey once and for all!

The camera angles really captured the emotions and pain of the characters in the movie.  The movie itself was about 2.5 hours long and seemed almost filled with scenes that should have been left on cutting room floor.  Overall, there was nothing new in this slave story  that hasn't been seen in countless other movies and documentaries of this savage chapter in American History.  The evil slave masters, the sometimes compassionate slave owners, sexual assualt of slaves and dissoultion of families has all been done before.  This particular story, based on one man's experience as a free man than captured back into slavery was unique to main character but not to overall history.  Preffered to see an expansion of the plot of before and after capture and freedom.  Overall, nothing new here that hasn't been done before.

6059649,5,B00G4Q3KOC,I wondered why it got so many awards. So worth the depressing parts to learn just how inhuman people can be under and for the bible. Make ya sort of sick I hope.,1395878400,,161,3.909090909090909
6059650,4,B00G4Q3KOC,A bit gruesome but realistic portrayal of the dark side of slavery in early America -- and it was mostly a dark period in our country's history.  A well written and well acted movie.  I always enjoy an excellent performance by new actor discoveries and performances by them -- this movie does not disappoint!,1395878400,,308,4.685185185185185

6059653,5,B00G4Q3KOC,Masterful directing and acting propels this pretty simple tale into something pretty phenomenal. Painful to watch at times but it does not fall into the trappings of over dramatizing (if thats even possible with such insanely grisly subject matter).

6059656,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"Great movie.  Got me thinking about the whole slave thing and how little things have progressed between the races.  Well, that was helped by the George Zimmerman and Michael Dunn not guilty verdicts.  One kid shot for wearing a hoodie, the other for playing loud music.  *sigh*",1395878400,,277,4.829787234042553
6059657,5,B00G4Q3KOC,A excellent capture of man's inhumanity to man. A good visual of what occurred during the slave trades. Needs to be taught in the schools so people have the history of the slave trades and what really went on.,1395878400,,209,4.384615384615385
6059658,5,B00G4Q3KOC,Our human capacity to cause pain and denigrate others is difficult to comprehend.  This movie is tough to watch but the story sheds much light on America in the 1800s.  Well worth watching.,1395878400,,189,4.696969696969697

There is a scene that will be forever imprinted on my mind. Solomon has been hung by his neck with his feet just barely scrapping the ground. Hour after hour he hangs there. struggling to touch the ground with his toes so he does not choke to death from the rope. You can hear him gasping for air as the rope digs into his throat. The sun sets, and night moves... the hours tick by, as Solomon continues to hang from this rope. He hangs there in view of everyone who lives on the plantation. Everyone is going about their day; working, doing laundry, cooking, as Solomon is slowly dying in agony, all in plain view. I cannot imagine these people and some our ancestors, could have ever participated in the torture and slavery of people.  This scene depicts the total devastation, dehumanized, and desensitized mindset of these enslaved people. This is a disturbing and compelling film that I will not ever forget.",1395792000,2,1079,4.505102040816326

This was not one of those movies and I should have rented it. This movie isn't on the level of: Mandingo, Roots, Glory, Amastad,The Color Purple and Mississippi Burning just to name a few.  This is my view of the movie and many people may feel differently. We like what we like and if you feel strongly about it; then own it.

There's nothing new or outstanding here. Whips, slaves and masters with bad attitudes. It's been done a hundred times before, and it's been done much better. Ejiofor added nothing, not even a change in his facial expression. Brad Pitt didn't show up until the last 15 minutes of this torture fest. I had to turn on the captioning. Either something was wrong with my DVD or everybody mumbled their lines. The cracking of the whip, however, came through loud and clear, as did the screams. Goodness sakes, we can't have a massa's whip not crack menacingly while it turns a slave's back into hamburger, can we?

Movie of the year, my foot. Nothing in this flick warranted the praise and attention it got. Maybe I can resell this stink bomb on Ebay and get some of my money back.",1395792000,13,818,4.557823129251701

6059668,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"We were prepared not to like this movie, suspecting that it might turn out to be a propaganda piece put out by those seeking reparations for slavery of generations past, but, while this depicts the worst aspects of that period, it does it well, keeping the viewer intensely interested in the characters throughout. Seeing Brad Pitt enter the scene toward the end of the piece was a bit off-putting, as we're all used to seeing him in a more major part, but lest you wonder, he still plays ""the good guy."" Keeping in mind that some of the slave owners treated their people more humanely (if one can ever say that when slavery is involved), such putative owners are nearly completely absent from this work. One who seems to be such, has to sell his due to financial hardship. Nevertheless, the film does a good job of giving the viewer a sense of what it was like to live in that period.",1395792000,,885,4.469135802469136

So often the the movies seen in the US shy away from the type of emotional and physical closeups which make this movie so powerful.  The acting is great as is the portrayal of abuse and humiliation of a gifted people and social class who sustain and maintain through their sufferings and injustices a system which proclaims justice and freedom for all... unless you are brown, indian or black.  It is heavy, moving and awakening...  In the age of I First America, it is important to see the underside of the culture we seek to impose even today on the world and underpriviledged US brothers and sisters.",1395705600,,700,4.531746031746032

6059690,4,B00G4Q3KOC,This movie shows realistic difficulties that the slaves had to endure.  Slavery was never portrayed in this manner before and it will make a person understand that slavery was really evil.  Great acting and directing!,1395705600,,217,5.171428571428572

It is hard to believe our country went through such a dark time.  Seemed to me to very similar to the Holocaust.  I bet if there was a tally of how many were hung, killed, worked to death, etch, the numbers would be just as high as the Holocaust.

Even with the slanted viewpoint, the depth of inhumanity that some slave owners exhibited was presented.  For example, the sale of children and the resultant separation from the mothers and fathers was shown with all the misery that it caused.  Also, the beatings/lashings of the slaves for minor offenses or even no offenses at all was painfully viewed.",1395705600,2,518,4.988372093023256

6059702,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"An important film, dramatically as well as sociologically and historically.  Its honesty and sober subject are refreshing in an era of easy emotionalism, violence and gratuitous ""action"" in so many films.  The acting and directing are first rate.  The directing is sensitive.  There seems to be a problem in editing and perhaps the writing as well.  A common problem: the editor and director are so close to the story, they don't realize that some of the editing obscures clarity, causing confusion for the audience.  I suspect that some of this is because it's felt the audience doesn't need a lot of hand-holding; ""they can figure out some things on their own"".  That's appreciated to some extent, but attention to clarity ought to be scrupulously followed.  Nevertheless, the film was deeply moving and disturbing for the light shown on the malignancy of slavery and cruelty on an individual level as well as cultural.  I have an ancestor who was a slave holding, plantation owner.  Having seen this excellent film now, I am even more saddened by it all; the whole issue of the inhumanity is closer to home and the tragedy felt more personally.  Finally, it must be said the overall work was artistically superb and unique in its needed treatment of an evil scar in the history of mankind and our country.

I don't think the young lady portrayed in the movie--  dLupita Nyong'o, playing the pretty young slave Patsey deserved the Oscar for best supporting actress however.  Just because an ""acceptable black actor"" portrays a slave, hooker, thug or rogue cop well, does not an Oscar or Golden Globe worthy nomination make. Angela Bassett for Tina Turner, Denzel Washington for Malcolm X and others have been much more deserving of the honor of Best Actor nominations and wins in my opinion.....and more than once. However, they seemed to be overlooked for their performance because they represented strong or controversial characters. But what was important was getting the facts told which were presented well.  The vast majority of slaves were stolen from Africa and treated with unimmaginable and extreme cruelty.

The acting was great aside from Brad Pitt, what was he even doing there? I don't know.

As we are witnesses, we become part of the story; this is an inescapable truth. To bear witness, whether to the suffering of the Jews, or of Native Americans, or slaves in our past or present, deepens the chance of humanity to evolve beyond the savagery and heartlessness that have made slaves of us all. Perhaps art such as this is the best hope for our growth, and until some better medium is invented, the brave work of Chiwetel Ejiofor and the writer, director, producers and crew of ""12 Years a Slave"" will stand.",1395619200,,647,4.445378151260504

6059781,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"I cried during the whipping of Patsy, and more at the end of the movie when he was reunited with his family. This movie does one thing well: Pull at the heart strings. As for complexity of story there was very little. There seemed to me to be so much opportunity to feel the anxiety of the slaves, the fear they felt of the future when in troublesome situations, the hope and the bonds they felt, or the mourning of their numbed consciences and lost feelings due to witnessing and being the subjects of the dehumanizing effects of slavery. The actors were excellent all the way through, but they were all asked to play very simple one-dimensional roles, in my opinion, and I see that a very significant number of reviewers, even those who liked the movie like I did, shared this opinion that the actors were given very static roles to play. This movie is the kind of movie that I think is worth watching once and having a soul washing cry that makes you want to walk away thinking of love, and justice, and charity... but I don't think I need to revisit the scene over and over again. I think that the one time a year where we need to stare at such injustice of an innocent man being flogged and beaten, and pushed under the injustice of the world, we should do that on Good Friday when Jesus is hanging on the cross for the world's sins. That was something that the slaves all did more frequently than the rest of us, because they so much shared in his experience, and that is what that song they sang ""Roll, Jordan, Roll"" meant.",1395532800,11,1530,4.353146853146853

6059784,2,B00G4Q3KOC,"When you start with an absolutely compelling story, you figure you have a winner. Sadly, this doesn't live up to the hype. The writing is just boring. The actors aren't given much to do. It's all about talking and action. There is no window into their souls and little character development. A good story draws you in. It makes you feel something. The writer's left it up to the viewer to feel sorry for what they were seeing, not to feel for the characters as people, which is quite a different thing. There was so much lost opportunity here. Working in sugar was HORRENDOUS. (Read ""When I Was a Slave"" by Normal R. Yetman, which is a compilation of firsthand accounts of slavery for insight into the barbarity. It's available free on Kindle). This movie doesn't depict that at all. The star of the show was the scenery. When the background outshines the foreground, that can only lead to disappointment.

6059791,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"I became a fan of director Steve McQueen's work after seeing ""Shame"" starring Michael Fassbender. In ""12 Years a Slave""  McQueen was the first black person to ever win the Oscar for Best Picture. The story takes place in 1841 when Soloman Northrop is captured in Washington, D.C. (where slavery was abolished at the time) and taken to Louisiana to be a slave. The film follows Soloman's life for 12 years as he battles slave owners, watches in horror as he sees how his race is treated  and his determination to free himself.

 The film reminds one of ""Roots"", the TV mini-series that aired in 1977, and one cannot help but be reminded how blacks were treated and its effects on society even today.

 Michael Fassbender (currently my favorite actor) also stars in this movie as a dastardly slave owner who constantly rapes and beats his female salve (played to perfection by Lupita Nyong'o,who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar).

 A great film about a terrible and unforgettable time in American history, this film, like ""Roots"", will live on for eternity for others to be educated.",1395446400,,1087,4.806451612903226

12 Years A Slave is well worth watching and the best part? Steve McQueen (the director) made a beautiful movie and I don't remember him having his cast use foul language once to ""further the story line""!

6059799,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"I'm not sure what I was expecting when I eagerly started to watch 12 Years a Slave.  Quite frankly, it initially left me disappointed on several levels in spite of the fact that it is a good movie and well worth the watch.  My first gut reaction is that it bore an uncanny resemblance to The Passion of Christ, a movie that I thoroughly despised for it's ridiculous tediousness.  The problem I have is this:  simply watching people getting bludgeoned, whipped, kicked and lynched over and over and over in the most brutal ways imaginable does not a good movie make.  Like the details that were the basis of  ""The Passion of Christ"", most of us are fully aware of the brutality of slavery as well as the Biblical narrative of the scourging of Jesus.  Not only that, most of us have also watched this brutality over and over again throughout the years in many other movies; just not to the extreme degree as depicted in ""12 Years.."" and ""The Passion...""  Having said all of that, ""12 Years a Slave"" was a far, far better movie than ""The Passion.."" At least it touched upon the main plot points of the memoirs of Solomon Northrup.  I also have to say that the acting in ""12 Years""  was first rate as were the set designs, costuming, etc.

""12 Years"" is, in my opinion, a good movie but not a great movie.  I do think that it was highly over-rated.  It is not a movie I would want to watch again and again.  I have watched it twice through already, primarily because my first reaction was decidedly lukewarm at best, simply because of the previously described near-tediousness of it's brutality.  It was my second viewing of 12 Years, however, that I really learned to appreciate the masterful work of this film and therefore changed many of my first somewhat negative reactions.

12 Years a Slave is indeed a very gut-wrenching, emotional film and is well worth the watch.  I would recommend it to anyone except those who are squeamish about blood, gore, violence and the vicious side of human nature.  This is probably THE definitive film on the nature of slavery in spite of what I've said before about it having been done before.  12 Years a Slave probably captures the very essence of slavery better than any other film ever made about the subject, so it gets my recommendation in spite of my minor disappointments.",1395446400,2,2316,4.5641646489104115

For the first time, a major Hollywood film (mostly financed by Brad Pitt's production company Plan B) shows at length the treaments and the sufferings of the slaves at the plantations in the American south.  This is commendable and worth telling.  As a film, it is well-written, directed and acted.  The end result is not as powerful and devastating as I had wished and expected.  Could it be the presentations of the well-heeled black Americans in NYC which we are not familiar with that undermined our perceptions of its authenticity?

The composer even used the same, single instrument to play the four notes (oboe? not sure). I'm going to have to go check ImDB and am going to be stunned if it's the same composer....

The story: A man held against his will from the family he loves, forced to submit himself to men who are clearly of lesser material. Eljiofor's performance ought to be experienced rather than recounted in an Amazon review.

The shots: From the red paddle boat paddle churning water in intervals to the oppressive geometry of the holding cell to the minutes-long static shots on the posture of a hanging man to the eyes of Solomon, squared with the camera, looking for his captor in the audience.

6059837,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"I gave this movie 4 instead of 5 stars for a reason.  While the lead actor really drew you into the emotional aspects of the drama and very often enabled you to actually feel like it was you in the part, the story line was typical, for the most part,  and I didn't feel like 12 years went by, there wasn't enough content to fill that bill.  I felt like a couple years went by.  Unfortunately they can't make a movie long enough to accomodate the whole 12 years, but they hit on the key pivotal times that brought him to his eventual freedom.

It does a good job of making you realize some things that you didn't realize were happening at the time slavery existed.  It did a great job of making those of us that are white ashamed that our ancestors were such terrible people. Moreover, you realize clearly that no human has a right to judge nor control or own another human being. and that most human beings have value no matter their race or anything else.  I know I would have ended up in jail for being nice to the slaves if I had to be in a household that owned them.

all in all, it did keep my attention and it did a very good job of capturing my emotions and making me actually ""feel"" like I was there.

After his wife and two children leave for a short trip, Simon signs on with two men who say they want him to play his violin and accompany acts in their circus in Washington, D.C. Simon is happy and is paid $43 for his musical talents by the two men at a dinner table and he drinks far too much, ultimately waking up in chains and shackles! He is steam shipped off for sale into slavery in Louisiana!! This true story will shake you to your core because Simon is an educated black man and has worked as an engineer before being sold into slavery. His knowledge and experience and the way he has lived his life as a free American will cause much conflict from insecure masters and others who do not want to believe that he was a free man who was sold into slavery. 12 Years a Slave should be seen because slavery still exists on Planet Earth and because of the effects that slavery has on both the enslaved and the slaver, alike!!

6059841,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"It's easy to see why this film was awarded with 9 Oscar nominations and multiple Oscar wins (including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actress). ""12 Years a Slave"" is the true story of a free Black man residing in NY who was kidnapped and enslaved for 12 years in the Deep South during the pre-Civil War era. Be forewarned: the movie depicts the horrors and violence of slavery in graphic and unflinching honesty, so if you are watching this with age-appropriate youth you will want to spend some time discussing what they will they see first.

The story is gripping and the acting is superb. There are many scenes that moved me to tears -- including Solomon Northrup's (masterfully acted by Chiwetel Ejiofor) realization that he has been duped by two White men into a life of slavery, and a heartbreaking scene where plantation slave Patsey (in a tour-de-force performance played by Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong'o) begs to be spared from punishment for leaving the plantation simply to procure a sliver of soap so she can wash the dirt and sweat of the cotton fields off her exhausted body.

This movie showcases beautiful cinematography and is rich with complex characters who have both admirable and less-admirable qualities (the way I like it!), and it is unflinching in it's depiction of the horrors and violence of slavery (rightly so, in my opinion). But it rises above a simply historical review of events in its story-telling, which depicts human cruelty vividly but also conveys an ultimately uplifting story of faith, survival, family bonds, and what can happen when good people do the right thing.

Those changes are not unique as they are often reflected in action adventure movies, however using parallels in historical material helps ground the viewer. 12 Years a Slave reminds the viewer of just how far we've come as human beings and just how close we are to not behaving as such.

12 Years a Slave captured my attention and left me drained for several days.  After the first day, I was able to articulate how I felt as I watched it.

As many people pointed out, this is a violent film, but it has to be in order to be true to the story and the period in which it occurs.  And it is an uplifting feeling when Solomon is finally repatriated to his home.

6059872,3,B00G4Q3KOC,"This movie made a worthy attempt to be ""realistic"". It avoided stupid historical inaccuracy. Artistically, he acting, writing and directing were ok, and it attempted to get into not just the physical but also the psychological and spiritual suffering of the main characters. So why did I not like the movie? I think the idea that a commercial film can give an accurate picture of slavery is a measure of the hugely inflated egos of movie makers and actors, etc. Of course this movie got Oscar for best picture, so that must mean it's ""important"" right? But the Oscars are just part of the closed feedback loop in which Hollywood tells itself it is meaningful, profound and relevant. Yet all movies about unthinkable (because our minds are too small to grasp the vast and complex suffering of millions of people over centuries) historical nightmares are in the end just entertainment. 12 Years a Slave and Schindler's List manipulate audience emotions in the exact same way as Sleepless in Seattle or Toy Story. In the end, as I sit in my comfortable sofa eating popcorn and telling myself I am getting a history lesson, I am participating in a big self-congratulatory lie. Movie makers who deal with such painful topics might try being less pompous and self-deluded. In fact 12 Years helped me to appreciate Inglourious Bastards and Django Unchained more -- at least Tarantino knows he is nothing more than an entertainer trying to make a buck for the studios..",1395187200,,1461,4.848

6059888,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"Though not necessarily appropriate for children (at least younger than about 14), this is an amazing piece of cinematography.  It is not a happy, feel-good movie but it does an heart-wrenching but decidedly accurate job of showing a true life look at the conditions and situations of pre-Civil War deep south slavery, both the unconscionable as well as the community therein.  My middle school-aged and high school-aged children are both in US history courses this year and both of them were riveted from beginning to end.  There are numerous scenes of brutality and frequently repeated use of the racial slur that masters took to calling their slaves.  However, again, it is true-to-life as told by the free man-turned-kidnapped slave, Solomon Northrup, whose 1853 memoir this film was adapted from.  This film definitley deserved its Academy Award.  I have not seen Matthew McConaughey's perfomance in Dallas Buyers Club yet but after seeing 12 Years a Slave, I wish that the Best Actor Oscar had gone to Chiwetel Ejiofor - he was beyond incredible.",1395187200,,1051,5.0813953488372094

While we are minorities ourselves we are not black however you don't need to be black or any other minority to feel the pain felt by the characters that were played in this film.  This movie is based on the real life events of Solomon Northup, who was born a free black man and then out of trickery and deception was thrown into a life of slavery.  He described his life over the 12 years that he was thrown into this life in the book and the movie did justice to his story.  I have seen other movies regarding slavery and none have touched me like this one has.  Do yourself a favor, if you never watch another new movie this year make sure that this is the one that you do see.  The only way that this movie can't move you is if you have no heart, however I don't see how anyone can watch the graphic nature of this film and not be moved.  12 Years A Slave deserved the Oscar for best picture.",1395187200,,1063,4.009478672985782

I think movies give slave owners a pass too many times. Yes there is a big bad slave owner but a kindly one always to equal it at. The jealous wife or the the wife who fools around with the slaves because her husband is.  I would really like to see a movie about slavery that really depicts how horrible it was.

I don't know what I was expecting, but since it won the Academy Award for Best Picture, I was thinking it would be a movie I would want recommend to other and to watch over again. This is not the case.
I don't recall anything about the movie that I would want to watch again to see what I missed or learn more about.
The story itself is a good one, but I believe it would have been an even better movie if it had gone farther and explored the prosecution of the slave sellers and slave pen owner.  The movie ""Amistad"" is a good example of what I mean. Like the story of Solomon Northrop, The story of ""Cinqu"" was told not only with the depiction of his capture and the hardship that followed, but also the legal fight to free him.  It showed that in 1841 (the same time period of 12 years a slave) that there were good people in this land that believed that slavery was wrong and the lengths they would go to for Cinqu and the other men and women help prisoner.
It is important for all people to learn history and I learned a lot from Amistad but not much from 12 years a slave.",1395100800,,1117,4.072727272727272

I read ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" last year - it's just as harsh and realistic about slavery as ""12 Years a Slave"" (after all, Lincoln said Harriet Beecher Stowe started the Civil War), but it's great literature and, while painful, was a pleasure to read.

6059967,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"This is a really good movie however it can be painful to watch. Which frankly, I think is important.  General Patton wanted to film the German concentration camps because he felt at some point in the future there would be deniers. I've been to quite a few southern plantations and I find they mostly concentrate their message on the wonderful life of the tenants...minus the slaves that provided that life of luxury. There's lots of time spent on debutantes and finery but not much on beating the crap out of the un-hired help. This system can't quite be called deniers but it certainly likes to look the other way. I found one plantation that told the slave story in detail and oddly enough it also happens to be where I bought the book, 12 Years a Slave, many years ago.

This is a well acted, filmed, and directed movie. It's moving, and frustrating and yet it ends on a high note. But the language and brutality is realistic and unflinching. It's visceral. It's rated R so I watched it first before letting my 7 year old anywhere near it (he's not ready yet). There's nudity but not gratuitous...which a lot of people say about movies but here I felt it was presented in such a way as to show you the chattel-like way the slaves were processed by the slave industry. It's very brief and doesn't linger. Then there's the violence...brutal realistic whipping and beatings. That may turn your stomach but that's kind of the point isn't it? I want my son to understand that wartime and preservation of life are the only times when brutality can be acceptable, and even then, only enough to stop the attacker. It's never acceptable when used to support someones lifestyle.",1395100800,,1671,4.622895622895623

This story of mental and physical endurance was well written, casted and directed.  A little hard to watch at times, but the truth can be painful.  I would not suggest that it is suitable for anyone younger than 18, and some adults may find parts of it a bit too much.  The nudity is no more than what is required to get the point across, and the physical abuse was done in a manner that makes those short segments almost bearable to watch.

6059992,2,B00G4Q3KOC,"The two is only for acting and productions values. But, contrary to what popular columnists might say this film will NOT ""start the healing. My wife and I have watched all the best pictures in the history of the Oscars (and many hundreds more films), so we did watch this, also. I almost ended, two or three times in the film, my lifelong tradition of watching every moment of all the best pictures. I almost turned it off during the long partial hanging, during his early beating, and certainly during the absolute beyond-Peckinpah flogging. The point was beaten to death far, far, far before the cameras left the scenes. How much more value, how much more of a lesson, do I get from watching five minutes of the brutal whipping and seeing the back of that woman? Is it the third, fourth, fifth minute that teaches me, a 60-year-old guy, that lesson? Or did I know the whole truth at the first blow? But I watched and absorbed it all.

I completely understand the (apparent) point of the movie. The story of that poor man, that real person, is beyond horrific, and is a great illustration of the great horror and incredible inhumanity to which many Americans gave rise in the southern USAs early history. But as a lesson (as I see these movies), who is it that needs it? Those who need the lesson, 160 years later, instead of learning it, will enjoy seeing the nonstop violence inflicted on the black slaves, and they will enjoy hearing the repetition and use of the n-word in this worst of the worst contexts.

Those who don't need the lesson, who know the horror, and see related horrors in the world today, just feel the pain. It just creates greater sorrow and despair in my soul at the lack of, or slowness, or retrogradation, of social evolution during my lifetime. No healing here.

It was not a story with any opportunity for hope or redemption. Grapes of Wrath, yes; Shawshank, yes; Schindlers List (which I did not want to see at the time because, again, I knew the Nazi lesson, didn't need it, and knew the pain it would be to watch it), absolutely, yes, the redemption comes in those films  not necessarily to the evil ones, not at all to the evil ones in some cases. But 12 Years fails. There is no indication of hope anywhere in the film, except his personal hope. Instead of emerging with there is hope, I emerge fundamentally depressed and with a sense of futility and hopelessness. How fundamentally, searingly sad the human race was, is, and will be.

As beautiful a film as it is, well constructed, with wonderful cinematography and movement, I place it with things like The Fight Club, and others that give free rein to the violent, and in this case, horrific side of the odd American psyche. It had no possible good impact on me, and my abhorrence of slavery and slave owners, and I contend it has no possible good impact on those other good people who are horrified and mortified at that long chapter in American (and human) history. I contend that it adds to the hate, makes innocent people hate more. And, sadly, the ones who, I think, will enjoy it the most will be those racists who get to watch the long hanging and flogging and beating scenes, and hear lots of white powerful people call the black slaves the things that those racists wish they could still freely say.",1395014400,2,3297,4.543771043771044

As a white man that lives 30 minutes south of New Orleans with family dating back well before the Civil War, I was apprehensive about renting this movie because of how white people may be depicted. I am fully against slavery and although every slave owner was not like the evil men portrayed in movies, there was a 50/50 chance of ending up with one during exchanges downtown N.O. Unfortunately this man fell into the hands of some evil and despicable human beings. I recommend this movie to anyone who can handle the graphic details of this man's 12 years enslaved.

The focus was on portraying Christian white southern men as over-sexed, sadistic loons with no redeeming qualities.  And while no one can doubt that the black slaves were treated with cruelty at times, Hollywood went completely over the top with that concept in this movie.
As to the acting, there was a glimmer of greatness from time to time in Chiwetel Ejiofor but the majority of the acting by him and the others was lukewarm at best.  Really, I found that the best part of this movie was the occasional black spiritual.  I'm afraid that this one got the awards not because it was that good, but only because Hollywood was trying to make some kind of political or social statement.",1394928000,,808,4.629370629370629

Everything is overdone, overwrought, and milked to death.  Scenes drag on and on and on until I wanted to beg for mercy.  This should have been great, but it was awful.

Understanding the intention of the film was to display the true brutality of slavery in the 1800's... maybe we need more awareness of the past. But for an almost three hour film, I wanted to get to know Solomon more as a person, I would have loved to see the trials after he was freed again. I would've loved to seen more of his life and family before he was captured. But the brutality was all that was left. Hard to stomach violence and degradation only goes so far to create awareness. Maybe I'm out of touch, but this film wasn't anymore effective to me than Glory, Roots or even the ridiculous Django Unchained as far as purveying a message of deep inequality and on-going struggle.

6060018,3,B00G4Q3KOC,"African American here. First generation of my family raised in the north. I agree with other reviewers who say this is television movie of the week level drama and acting. Little better than good. Directing very poor. Screen play so very average. One day far in the future when none of it makes whites squirm we'll be allowed to tell our own story. To fail and succeed at trying to write screenplays, and cast the films we, my people, want to see made about this subject. Think of it like this. We needed many films about the Holocaust. One film could never capture the depth of horror, nor of human dignity and courage. We needed Schindler's List. We needed Sophie's Choice. We needed Anne Frank's book and the plays that have followed and the movies. One day, I can only pray for I am old now, one day there will be a wealth of film and books telling our stories, from every angle. 12/yrs a Slave was a mighty effort. The actors did their best with the material. But aside from our suffering, our slavish lives as beasts cruelly treated; aside from the fact that we had to turn our backs on one another to survive...there's nothing new here. Yet and still, I appreciate the effort. But I expected more. Roots showed our joy, our suffering, and our humanity. Beloved, as flawed as it was as a film, and it was God awful, in part, it still showed our insistent claim to our own dignity. Patsy does that in this film...but her story is clouded and unclear. So much so one reviewer, here on Amazon, thought she was merely the Master's play thing. The reviewer didn't seem to understand that she'd been nursed at the master's pap from a baby child to be his concubine and to accept every indignity and cruelty he cared to inflict. He's even shown with the new pet-colored-child slave he'll use next. Why this subject is always treated with subtlety I won't digress to discuss. We need more films, coming at this subject from wider, and narrower angles. Even more D'jango's, if need be, and all the yet unimagined rest. But most of all, African American people must be allowed to shape this story and tell it from our own experience...generations later, as imagined...because our ancestors were too ashamed, too eager to protect us, to tell us what truly happened. We are not degraded human beings. We are some of the greatest people on earth to have triumphed over the institution known as slavery. And yes, that institution has also robbed too many of us from our humanity...as it did the slave holders. I did appreciate seeing a white woman shown as perpetrator not victim. My people have known this for generations. This fact is made know without adornment in this film. Twice, on two plantations. One woman is shown as fueled by jealousy...while in fact she's as lustfully cruel as her husband. The other white woman doesn't want a grieving slave's grieving to disturb her lovely plantation life. Kudos for getting that on film. It cannot be said enough, that the institution of slavery would not have endured without the eager participation of white men AND women. And I also wish they'd shown the living conditions of poor whites. You all do realize that slave owners were essentially the 1%? Most whites were poor as Joe's turkey hen. Subsistence farming. Filthy living quarters down home int he dirty south. Whites in the pre and industrialized part of the country, also squalor and poverty. I couldn't give a film about slavery a two. My great grandfather was a slave. I asked his daughter, my great aunt, when she was one hundred years old, had her father ever said anything about slavery? He'd been a young child when slavery ended. But my aunt said, ""Nope he never said.""",1394928000,,3680,4.645705521472393

6060024,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"""12 Years a Slave"" is the third film by the 43-year-old British director Steve McQueen, whose last film was 2011's controversial ""Shame"", one of Roger Ebert's (and my own) best films of that year.

This tells a true story of a free New York black man abducted after the Civil War and taken south to be sold into slavery. The man's name was Solomon Northup, and he spent 12 years in horrendous conditions as a slave, and this film was drawn from Northup's own diaries. The film is incredibly unrelenting in its intensity and realism, but don't let the depressing subject keep you away because it's not only a rewarding film experience, it's virtually a must-see.  The most acute statement made about ""12 Years a Slave"" was by a podcast critic who said, ""The best thing about this film is its lack of nobility.""  I agree completely.  There is more dignity and respect in this film for not resorting to high-minded moral statements that almost always turn films centered on important subjects like this into banality or sentimentality.

""12 Years a Slave"" is an adult film that is above any simplistic message film; it makes the viewer live the experience and come away transformed.  Don't miss it.",1394928000,,1195,4.748792270531401

who are causing so much havoc and crime in the nation's urban centers. I am a 65-year-old black man
and a longtime college teacher. The biggest race problems in America stem from so many whites who
will not admit how brutal slavery was and how its legacy stills exists in the psyches of too many whites,
how too many still feel they have an an automatic and inherent right to be above all blacks in all of life's endeavors.
The other problem is the large numbers of mostly younger blacks who fail to appreciate all the sacrifices
that have been made for them and selfishly embraced a rough, violent culture in its all manifestations
that is causing Dr. King and Mary McLeod Bethune, among so many others, to turn over in their graces

I had expected it to be momentous but instead I watched a story unfold with the same old storyline already played over and over again in previous stories of abusive slave owners.

Before you judge my opinions, hear me out. Its not that I am a denier of the horrific happenings on southern plantations. I am just as appalled as the next guy by those recounts. I believe the writer/s and director Steven McQueen took the easy way out in this film only seeking sensationalism and not the direction they could have taken to bolster the positive aspects of the true life character of Solomon Northup. Over an hour of this movie is devoted to whippings, rapes, and other inhumane desecration.  Enough already! We get it! I got it in the first thirty minutes. Tell me something I don't already know. Maybe assign more than one sentence conversations to the characters. Perhaps more dialog than starry eyes, mean glares, and other dramatic looks would have helped the viewer to indulge in the story its self.

I was amazed at the end of of a very long and boring movie, there are about five paragraphs devoted to true facts about Northup. Huh! Why in heavens name wasn't a storyline created around his success, his abolitionist involvement, his life after captivity?

In my opinion, there is no way this movie was deserving of the Academy Award. It is a shameful money grab by Hollywood and ignored a story that really needed to be told.",1394841600,68,1572,4.726277372262774

6060105,3,B00G4Q3KOC,"Film could've been stronger. There were parts I liked and parts I didn't.

What I liked: the generally believable way slavery is presented here in that the story shows some of the costs of slavery to the slave. I give the film 3 and 1/2 stars for it's generally honest representation of slavery and for including the stories of the woman who lost her two young children, and the woman who was repeatedly raped and abused by her masters.

Acting was good.

Disliked:

(1) Overly formal sounding dialogue, almost as if the film is a play.

(2) Initially overly emotional score, before the story had even properly begun. After Solomon is kidnapped and beaten, the story caught up with the score and it worked well enough for me.

(3) Solomon and his family aren't well written and are too bland, and in the coda when he's reunited with them, little sense of who he or his family are as people.  They are a cardboard middle class african american family - no spark, nothing interesting. The guts of the story is Solomon's slavery experience and it is horrible, but I would've liked to know who he is as a person, not just who he is as a slave. The writer of Fruitvale Station did a much better job presenting a multifaceted character than the writer did here. Because Solomon is so poorly written, didn't believe that he spoke up against his master as his master brutally beat the slave woman who left the plantation to get soap - felt abit Hollywoody, which means it was not properly written, not set up well. Should've had Solomon say nothing and wretch and cry; that would've been more believable, though not as heroic. Better yet, should've gotten a better writer, someone who can write set-ups.

(4) Shopkeeper unbelievable - when Solomon and his family are shopping the shopkeeper treats him excessively well. To make that work, writer should've shown that Solomon is especially indulgent in presenting gifts to his wife/children, which he purchases from this particular shopkeeper and is therefore a very good customer for the shopkeeper. As the story doesn't show this, shopkeeper's behavior sticks out as an ""why is he behaving that way,"" especially given Solomon/family are african american, the shopkeeper is caucasian, this is well before the Emancipation Proclamation and african american men are hanged routinely, and not just in the south: blatant racism is rife. If such politeness is important to the filmmaker, he should've shown a reason for it.

I experience significant racism now though I am not at all racist myself, so it must've been beyond hell for people of color in the 19th century, even in ""free"" states. It should be noted that Solomon went missing again some years after his rescue. It's quite possible that he was murdered, considering the book he wrote, the fact that he attempted unsuccessfully to have the men who initially imprisoned him punished, and that post-freedom he worked trying to free other enslaved people - any one of those behaviors could've easily gotten him killed, though the facts surrounding his death are unknown.

About the masters's behavior, what can I say except many behavior by dominants haven't changed: humans, though capable of kindness, beauty and love, are the most brutal and cruel animals on the planet, and many insist we're not animals but God's chosen ones - yeah, right. a mindset very similar to that of the film's masters.  We have been extremely evolutionarily blessed, but many don't believe in evolution. So no, many haven't changed, some are more cunning, is all.  For proof,  look no further than how we treat our food animals. I fervently wish we were better creatures. Many of us strive to do the right thing, but many of us don't. This will bite us in my opinion.

(5) Alfre Woodard as a ""power"" slave doesn't work for me. This is the second major film I've seen relatively recently featuring American slavery where the writer went out of his way to show there were some slaves who made the best of their situation, to the point of thriving, and these relatively powerful slaves were portrayed by noted african american actors. (The other is Samuel L. Jackson in Django.) Historically, no doubt some slaves did the best they could with their situation, but it's interesting that Hollywood chooses to place noted, very strong, actors in these parts, and that the stories feature in some measure the power slave's story and more importantly, their power. Suggests (to me) that Hollywood is saying slaves who were cunning enough could outmaneuver their masters. Yeah, right.

I don't mind that power slaves are included in slave stories, but I question why their power positions are featured in these stories and cast with amongst the best african american actors. By featuring these powerful slave characters and casting them with top talent, the films, to me, gain a disingenuous, propaganda-ish, revisionist, feel - as if Hollywood is suggesting that a class of african americans benefited from American slavery, just as caucasians did.

A similar type of argument would be a Holocaust film where within all the evil, terror, and misery of the concentration camps, gas chambers and starvation, a pretty, female Jewish slave was featured living large in the private apartments of an SS concentration camp officer. She'd dress well and have Jewish slaves attending her. Yes, no doubt there were Jewish women who were kept as sex slaves, but how abhorrent if a film about the massacres at the camps featured a smug, well nourished Jewish woman, dining with a few of her friends and gossiping in the officer's apartments, while people are being lead to the gas chambers. And if such a characterization were included in this hypothetical, think of the difference in impact if a noted, accomplished young actress played the part (someone as good as say Abigail Breslin) rather than an unknown and not as accomplished actress. There is a huge difference in impact when an established and accomplished actress/actor plays a part, it means the director/producer(s) wants the audience to pay attention to that role.

Such a portrayal would be untrue because such a woman would be a sex slave and her ""power"" would be limited to that apartment. To suggest by the story that she benefits from the Holocaust would be a travesty, given that she is a slave, less than a slave: she is a woman staving off death by acquiescing to rape. Because she is allowed to bathe and dress nicely simply means the officer doesn't want a stinky woman in his bed. If a storyteller featured her ""power"" by showing her boss around the Jewish slaves ordered to assist her, or by gossiping and bragging with her friends (other sex slaves to other SS officers) that she has the SS officer wrapped around her little finger, it's reasonable to ask why a filmmaker is showing such a characterization. It works if the filmmaker shows that the character is mentally unstable, or base or ignorant, but if the character is not treated as such, there is a problem for me. No sane, emotionally stable person wants to be a slave. Which is why I dislike the smug, bragging, power slave as portrayed by Alfre Woodard (Ms. Woodard is a wonderful actress, no disrespect meant towards her). In my opinion, the filmmakers suggest that because she is relatively successful, that slavery benefits her; her dialogue clearly suggests that she's running with it. While, in my opinion, what she is actually doing, given that she is property, is making her life as bearable as she can.  I'm not sure why the filmmakers have her bragging, but it doesn't work for me. Power slaves, especially when acted by well known african american actors being featured in a story reveling in their power, are a problem for me because of what I intuit the filmmaker is saying with the character and with the casting.  Lastly, in my opinion, given that American racism has a large bias against darker skin and kinky hair texture, it would've been more believable had a light skinned, smooth haired actress played the power slave.

In conclusion, because Solomon's characterization is so poorly executed, story doesn't really work for me. The only story I can recall where an african american male character has been victimized but the writer is gifted enough to make him a believable, vibrant, flawed, multifaceted character (in addition to showing his victimization) is Fruitvale Station. Solomon should've been better written. The masters in this film are better, more clearly written than Solomon. For example, the slaveowner wife is jealous. Her jealousy makes her cruel, evil, spiteful, vindictive and cunning. Her behavior is deeply unattractive, but recognizable.

Who is Solomon? What is his character, his nature? Does he drink, cheat on his wife, is he incautious, stupid, in debt and therefore so quick to make a buck that he goes off with slavers masquerading as musicians in a time when it is well known that free african americans are kidnapped and sold into slavery in slave states?  Why doesn't the caucasian men's generosity throw off alarm bells? Is he naive? And if so, why? Is he jealous of his wife, competitive with her? He and his family dress well, does he like to showboat? In a time when african american men are routinely lynched, why is Solomon so unafraid of the caucasian strangers he meets? He hasn't been a slave, but his father had. Solomon is an african american man in a country where most african american men are slaves and yet his behavior doesn't reflect his reality. Why? Showing the audience why would've added a richness and depth to the story that is lacking. Solomon's kidnapping is not his fault, but why is he so ignorant of his world? As written, he's just an african american family man who is kidnapped, I know little more about him than that, which is not a strong enough characterization.

In my opinion, whatever the story, whatever happens to the character, they themselves should be interesting enough to carry their own weight, to justify their inclusion in the story. They needn't be perfect, just recognizable, and their situation, their predicament, needs to be recognizable. We judge them against their predicament, and against how we'd react in their situation. If the character and their situation isn't recognizable, the audience won't care what happens to them.

At the end of this film, the audience still doesn't know who Solomon is. That isn't the actor's fault, it's the writer's responsibility to know what the audience needs in order to emotionally attach us to the character. The more situations where the character's nature is revealed, the more surface area the audience has to attach to the character. The writer must create the revelatory situations as the story moves along: the revelatory situations are the story. If a writer doesn't know how to do it, study I Love Lucy episodes, look at Star Wars and see how George Lucas attaches us to Luke, to the droids, to Obiwan. View Fruitvale Station. How does that writer make a lying, cheating character appealing? Obviously not by making him blameless or bland. Look at well-loved characters and try and figure out how the writer makes us love them. In my opinion, this is an essential skill for a screenwriter. The screenwriter here didn't do as well as I would've liked. Hopefully he/she will improve.",1394841600,,11330,4.8890625

6060113,2,B00G4Q3KOC,"12 Years A Slave is a film for white people. More specifically, white liberals. When I say that, I also mean that I firmly believe that no black person has any business watching the film. For the very reason I don't watch films about slavery: it is traumatic. Of course many black folks have watched the film, and maybe they came out no worse for wear, or think they did, but I am more inclined to think that this sort of psychological trauma, rooted in the Diaspora's beleaguered history in the United States, doesn't always surface on the level of consciousness. Beyond that, the film doesn't tell us anything that we didn't already know. That the institution of slavery was brutal, inhuman, and one of few things in this world that can be considered unequivocally, objectively, and absolutely evil.

What does any black person stand to gain from sitting in a dark movie theatermore than likely surrounded by white peopleand being psychologically assaulted for two hours? Will we then turn to those white audience members, or get together in groups with them later, and discuss how horrible it all was, how many tears they shed, and eventually breathe a collective sigh of relief that all that was in the past, and thank God that we've come so far?

6060114,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"Must see for all generations.
Brutal but honest situations which reveal how everyone justified slavery.
Good cast. Well directed.
Granted a 4 star because it was slow by need to allow everyone to absorb the FEEL OF THE FILM.",1394755200,,224,4.769230769230769
6060115,5,B00G4Q3KOC,This movie really shows the horrors of slavery and the endurance of the human spirit. The cinematography is beautiful and the actors did an amazing job. Lupita Nyong'o deserves every bit of the hype and Chiwetel Ejiofor should have won the oscar for best actor.,1394755200,,261,4.822222222222222
6060116,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"Nuanced, great acting, a beautiful film that will make you appreciate your freedom. Unlike any other films I have seen on the subject.",1394755200,,134,4.869565217391305
6060117,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"This was so well done, the characters really acted, all of them.  The story line was quite believable, realistic and I felt like I was right in the movie.  This was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  Steve McQueen deserved the Oscar for this movie and Brad Pitt is a marvelous person for producing this.  Everyone needs to see what some people had to endure for survival.",1394755200,,388,4.273972602739726
6060124,1,B00G4Q3KOC,"I am sick and tired of ""oh, poor me""  whoever played the supporting actress no more deserved her award than me!!! Don't bother.",1394755200,5,127,4.521739130434782
6060125,4,B00G4Q3KOC,Was good but not as good as all the hype. Please don't always request a set amount of words on ur reviews.  Sometimes just don't need that many,1394755200,,143,4.107142857142857
6060126,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"It was not as good as I thought it would be especially since it won an award. There were too many scenes that were un-realistic but others that made me feel bad knowing how much heartbreak and how cruel the (some)plantation owners were back then to these slaves. I haven't read the book, so I am sure a lot of information was left out in the movie.",1394755200,,348,4.208955223880597
6060127,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"I was really moved by this story. The reality of it just made me feel blessed to have been born free. The movie held nothing back about how cruel slavery in America was.  Being called the N word,rapes, beatings, long UNPAID hours on the cotton fields! No way could I have went through all that h*ll!",1394755200,,299,4.339285714285714
6060128,2,B00G4Q3KOC,"I couldn't connect to the characters, or the story.

I did feel bad in the parts when they were being tortured.

Lupita did great. Other than that, very dissapointed with it.",1394755200,,174,4.580645161290323
6060129,5,B00G4Q3KOC,Well done.  Provides an impressive and realistic insight into a difficult time in American history.  Excellent character development and portrayals.,1394755200,,148,6.35
6060130,3,B00G4Q3KOC,"After all the good reviews I've heard I thought I would watch this movie even though I was reluctant because I already knew what it was about and how it might end. Everything was well done, everything. I can't imagine what it could have been like how people were treated as slaves or what was going through the minds of the slave masters.

Myself, I've seen and heard enough of what was done during the American slaving trade and believe we must concentrate on today's respect and treatment of each other, don't keep on rehashing over what was done, all races have at one time or another been forced through cruelty unimaginable.",1394755200,,629,4.616071428571429
6060131,3,B00G4Q3KOC,"This movie loosely followed Solomon Northup's book, which was inciteful and riveting,  The movie was poorly edited, acting was very good, however again not oscar worthy.  I do suggest this movie, you will be inspired by one mans will and hope to live and see his family again.",1394755200,,276,4.729166666666667

6060133,4,B00G4Q3KOC,Some of the parts were hard to watch because they were so brutal.  I like to watch true stories.  Very well done!,1394755200,2,113,4.090909090909091

6060135,5,B00G4Q3KOC,I almost stopped watching in the first 10 minutes. The film show the clash between the evils man can do toward other human beings and the love and respect that everyone deserves. The Cameo by Brad Pitt starts the redemptive process and the happy ending. How cruel we can be! May God Bless all who have African Slave ancestors. The shame our country still fights to overcome. We have been blessed by the African Americans and I am so happy they are part of our culture. Yes at one time I was a lily white bigot but Jesus changed all that.,1394755200,2,537,4.326732673267327

6060140,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"This is a true story of a free black man, a man that had all the equal freedom of a white man in the 1800's, all the luxuries, he was well taught, was an excellent violin player and knew how to read and write, lived in a nice house.. he was free, one day he was tricked to play for money by two white men who got him drunk and sold him into slavery. He was kidnapped, and the heart-dropping adventure begins there. This movie is unlike other slave movies, it's no BS, it's based on real events in this man's life.. this is a true story, based on a memoir written by Solomon Northup and the detail is truly eye opening. I say that every American should see this with an open mind, put yourself in Solomon's shoes, for a few hours, watch this movie, and see the torture and pain black men and women had to go through in those times. There are a lot of people here that say ""this movie is boring"", i say no, this movie is full of adventure, it keeps you intrigued with how the story will end, a lot of close calls for Solomon.. this is truly worthy for an oscar, and is truly worthy of you to watch.. it's extremely educational, eye opening, and jaw dropping.. but be warned, reality bites. If you're white, you might cringe, but WATCH IT! It is an excellent film for all types of men and women, I suggest that kids under the age of 13 shouldnt watch this film, as there is a lot of violence, blood, gorish scenes, rape scenes, and nudity, and course language. I can't recommend this film enough, you will appreciate freedom and what you have a lot more after watching this. As for people who might think this is bias against white caucasians, no, there are a lot of amazing and non-racist white people in this film, one of which saved Solomon's life. So please don't think this is an anti-white film, it's truly not. This is reality, unfortunately.",1394755200,,1846,4.292263610315186

I thought I would stream the movie from Amazon and use the English subtitles for the hearing impaired.  I knew that laws had been passed requiring this by the end of 2013.  My Amazon Prime is about to expire and I thought I would check out the video streaming to see if I would renew my Prime membership.  The answer, of course, is that I will not renew the Prime membership since I can not hear the dialogue in streaming movies and Amazon offers me, and millions of others, no help because no subtitles are provided.

6060146,1,B00G4Q3KOC,"I saw absolutely no redeeming value in this picture. The performances are poor and Lupita must have won her Oscar with one screaming scene and she spends most of the movie in silence and in a small part. The Oscar win for Best Picture is a joke and has to be political. I'm sorry, but ""American Hustle"" and ""Gravity"" and ""Philomena"" were much better pictures.

I browse through the Amazon New Releases and ""12 Years A Slave"" catches my eye, so I rent the HD version and lean back into my pillow for some cinematic pleasure. UNPREPARED is what I was. I spent more time crying and sobbing than I did when our 12 year old Rotweiler died last January. I'm either extremely sympathetic, premenstrual or this is just a dang good movie with some dang good acting. I know it's the latter. So if you want to release some of that self pity and rinse it with some ""my life ain't that bad after all,"" then watch this movie to reshift your perspective.

6060156,5,B00G4Q3KOC,Fantastic.  A very well done show.  It was extremely emotional.  Showed a side of the slave owners that was hard to understand. Do (did) we really have  to treat people that way?,1394668800,2,178,4.46875

This movie made me realize what i already knew which is humanity is really messed up and primitive.  if you say racism is dead your lying to yourself it has evolved into a different thing in the 21st century but it still exists.  I think this is a good watch to remind yourself how far we have come and how far we still have to go.  there is a deep routed ill mind in all of us so be brave and remind yourself where you stand on this subject.,1394668800,,548,3.8660714285714284

6060162,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"The story line and portrayal of slavery is crushingly heart-breaking. The acting is quite good, by a largely unknown cast. The story-telling is overall quite good, but leaves portions unclear. The horror of the injustice is amplified by the realization that this kind of story is often repeated, today, in human trafficking.

The downloaded version of this movie is smooth, and largely without artifacts. It is not as vibrantly detailed on our 60"" screen, but adequate. The audio signal is accurate, but not very strong. I had to turn the A/V receiver way above what is normal for our setup. Fortunately, the digital signal seemed pretty clean.",1394668800,2,644,5.018691588785047

6060164,5,B00G4Q3KOC,The movie was better than I expected.  It shows well the abuse and cruelty that slaves endured without the stridency of other movies that have also dealt with slavery.  This film presentation is more powerful because the movie shows all the horrors of slavery convincingly and in a credible environment. The performance of Ejiofor is outstanding.  He transforms himself in the course of the movie from a self-assured and trusting person in the beginning to a fearful and mistrusting slave who walks with sloped shoulders and bent head.  The movie reminds us of a chapter in the history of mankind that should never be forgotten.,1394668800,,628,4.9523809523809526

6060171,3,B00G4Q3KOC,"12 YEARS A SLAVE is one of the most uncomfortable viewing experiences I've had in recent memory. It wasn't because I felt guilty for something my ancestors may (or may not) have had responsibility for, but because occasionally I felt that the movie wallowed in its own misery. It also felt exploitative and emotionally manipulative at times. That said, if one does not come away from this absolutely detesting slavery as an institution, there is something truly wrong with you. Fortunately, this story has a happy(ish) ending. Otherwise, the oppressive atmosphere might have choked all the life out of the story. On a technical level, the movie is astounding. Steve McQueen is an auteur to watch, now having three critically praised films under his belt. I also loved the score by Hans Zimmer, which was stark when it needed to be, but also filled with tenderness and longing. There are also several Negro spirituals peppered throughout which were also uplifting. Overall, this is a must-see film, not just because it's won a lot of awards, but because it treats a touchy subject with the honesty it deserves. However, I wouldn't watch it more than once unless you're a glutton for punishment.",1394668800,,1193,4.940298507462686

We, as a nation, once felt the black community were a lesser community, and we treated them as such.  I remember as a young person, sitting in the front of the bus, with plenty of available seats, with black passengers standing in the back.  I knew then, it was wrong.  Thank God, we have corrected it; even though it costs so many lives in order to correct it.  May God grant that we never again fall into such error.",1394668800,2,524,4.3061224489795915

6060176,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"I will be reviewing Academy awarded and nominated films. The first in this series is 12 Years A Slave.

I watched it last night. An emotionally draining film. It was brutal and depressing. The acting was outstanding by the entire cast. I am not surprised that this film won 131 of the 137 nominations received. (Academy Awards, Golden Globes, BAFTA Awards, Screen Actors Guild, and so on )12yearsaslave

Award winning director, Steve McQueen, has directed many short, and one other feature films. 12 Years A Slave should allow for this talented director to finally explode in Hollywood.

Based on a true story, Solomon (portrayed by Chiwetel Ejiofor) tells about his need to Survive. As a FREE man once living in upstate New York, Solomon is kidnapped and sold into slavery. Although Solomon hid the fact he was educated, and could read and write  he oftentimes stood up for himself, (but rarely for others). The fear that filled him was powerful. His goal remained constant, and commendable  to stay alive and make it back home to his family. To Freedom.

While some of Solomons encounters reveal. . .kindness, most of the slave owners and hired hands treat the slaves with less respect than what is shown to pigs in a stable. This is not an easy movie to watch. The violent and abusive physical, mental, and sexual treatment of human beings was more than enough to make my stomach churn. I had a constant knot in my gut, and oftentimes had to wipe tears from my eyes. There are countless scenes where people are whipped, hung, beaten, berated and raped.

However, this was a movie I am glad I saw. It was powerful and provoking. It made me angry and very sad. I find it difficult and horrifying to believe slavery was prevalent in our country, and even more shocking that it lasted as long as it did.

12 Years A Slave is an R rated, 134 minute long film that will hold you captive. It is the compelling story and the constant disgust that kept me from rarely so much as blinking. There are far too many actors and actresses to name. All deserve credit for their roles in the film. All deserve awards. It is only March 2014, but I believe Ive just seen the best movie of the year.

6060177,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"I have to admit, Im honestly torn here.  Figuring out how to honestly address the concerns that I have with a film that many have lauded as one of the most important films of our time is difficult, but being honest is the most important thing that anyone can be when compiling their thoughts on a film.  Whats the point in writing a review if you're merely going to cower to what everyone else is saying in an attempt to be liked?  But, in the same way that I am torn at the idea of writing this review, Im also torn with regards to the film itself, a film that had all the right intentions and the right storyline and yet failed in so many areas due to the mishandling of key attributes by the films director, Steve McQueen.

That actually really hurt me to say.

Ive been intrigued by McQueens career since his first feature film in 2008, Hunger.  He had such a harsh and dominating style, one that drew you in to each solitary moment and held you there, sometimes for extended moments, to make you feel each and every fiber of the film.  Shame was a brilliant depiction of suffering, addiction and anguish and was filmed with such precision, necessary detachment and obvious passion.  When it was announced that McQueens next film was going to be 12 Years a Slave it was instantly one of my most anticipated of 2013.  Often, the complaint thrown at films of this nature is that they are too sentimental and because of that they lack the harsh realism needed to make these stories truth telling.  McQueen seemed like the perfect voice, because his sentimental values have always been subtle; instead offering us a coldness that felt more honest.

First, I want to express that 12 Years a Slave is not a bad film at all.  In fact, there is a lot to really admire about it.  The story is a powerful one.  Solomon Northrup, a free man living in New York, is betrayed by men appearing as friends, drugged and ultimately sold into slavery with no way of defending himself.  He becomes a hired hand in Louisiana, tossed around from slave owner to slave owner because of his obvious learned background and his pent up frustrations (and refusal to be a dog).  For 12 years he lived in slavery before his story was properly heard and passed along the proper channel and he was able to be reunited with his wife and children.  This is a story that needed to be told, and one that Im happy was told.  As far as his story goes, it is told relatively well thanks to a beautiful performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor, who anchors this movie with such complete awareness of character.

But Ill get back to that in a minute.

I say that his story is told relatively well because outside of Ejiofors performance, the story, I feel, is somewhat mishandled.  McQueens approach to this film is vastly different from the way he attacked his previous two features, and Im not sure if that was intentional, but there is something amiss here.  When it was first announced that this film was being made, I declared that there was no way this was going to be an Oscar player.  McQueen is too harsh a filmmaker, too honest.  There is no way that the Academy, a body made up largely of elderly white men, is going to embrace a film about the harsh realities of racism and slavery.  I was baffled when it started to pick up such steam in the race for Best Picture of the Year, but now that Ive seen the film, it all makes sense.

This is Steve McQueens Schindlers List.

I know that that doesnt sound like a particularly bad thing, and in all honesty I do feel that Schindlers List is a very good film (I even said earlier in this review that this was a good film as well), but I have always felt detached from Schindlers List for a very specific reason, and it is the same reason that I feel detached from McQueens film; its far too clinical.  12 Years a Slave tries too hard to be too perfect, too correct, but unlike Schindlers List, not everyone in this film is up to the task of conveying this correctness, and because of that the film starts to falter.

While the entire cast has been lauded by critic after critic, there were only two performances here that I felt were honest enough, or grounded enough, to survive McQueens direction; Ejiofor and Lupita Nyongo.  These two performances held such authenticity in their movements.  Ejiofor, as I mentioned above, is so aware of his character.  He understands every layer of the man, and this is scene in the way he soaks in his surroundings in those giants wells he calls eyes.  You can read every inner thought, and those thoughts are never how do I act this scene (unlike a few of his co-stars).  Instead, Ejiofor is living this performance.  Some have commented that he is merely a walking ghost, but Northup WAS a ghost, for 12 years, constantly living in the horrors of loss and carrying the fear of death on his shoulders.  What I found particularly alarming (in a good way) about Ejiofors performance was that you could sense his character not only taking in HIS surroundings, but also taking in the realities of a world he didn't give much thought to before.  He was a free black man.  He had a job and a family and a home and was respected and beloved by men and women, black and white.  While this was an atrocious situation for him to find himself, you can see that he is finally becoming aware of a world much larger than he was himself.

It is a true testament to the strength of this narrative that I am actually finding myself WANTING to like this movie more than I do as Im writing this review.

Being honest can be hard.

Anyways, Nyongo is the only other actor I felt reached Ejiofors depths (maybe not quite as deep, but close) of earthy realism.  While many have criticized her performance for the very thing Im criticizing this film for (trying too hard), I was truly moved by every hand gesture, every cringe, every single movement.  It may have all been calculated (and I won't deny that it was) but it felt so fluid and authentic, which is NOT the case with those around her.

Yes, Im talking about Michael Fassbender, Alfre Woodard, Sarah Paulson, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Adepero Oduye and especially Brad Pitt (what in the WORLD was he doing?) and pretty much everyone in this film aside from the aforementioned and Benedict Cumberbatch.  These performances felt too correct, too exact and because of that they feel forced, inauthentic and take me out of the film itself.  Fassbender in particular (an actor I LOVE and have declared THE actor of his generation) is so out of his depth here.  You can see him attempting to portray in every scene as opposed to just living this character.  It always feels like a performance.  The whipping scene in particular is so disengaging, which is highlighted even more because both Nyongo and Ejiofor are so IN that moment that when Fassbender comes over yelling and screaming and ACTING it almost made me cringe.

There are no words for what Brad Pitt did in this film.  It was honestly a disgrace and one of the worst scenes in any film Ive seen this year.  It wasn't even just his performance itself, which was awful, but the phrasing of the scene itself which felt so forced and abrupt.

That is another issue I have with 12 Years a Slave.  There is absolutely NO consciousness of time here.  12 years come and go and for all I know it was a really long weekend.  No one ages, no one truly grows, everything pretty much stays the same from scene one to scene whatever and it just all felt so singular.  Maybe this was intentional.  Maybe the idea was to make these 12 years feel like one elongated nightmare, but the passing of time is what would have made the trials heaped on Northup feel all the more harrowing, and so I think this element is a truly important one, and one that significantly hurt this film.

And then there is the actual harshness of the film.  Im not saying that I wanted Passion of the Christ style gore here (and, for the record, Ive never seen that film but know of its reputation) but I will say that I expected something more from McQueen in the depiction of the brutal realities of slavery.  Maybe this should be linked alongside my issues with the films correctness, but it felt as if McQueen was holding back so much for fear of alienating his core audience; white people.  I won't say that he white washed this or sugar coated anything, and then again maybe I am.  Outside of the fact that they were slaves (and the whipping scene and the scene where Paulsons character threw a bottle of alcohol at Nyongos face) this film never seemed to get into the gritty truth about the treatment of these people, and that is a shame.  Even the rape scene felt oddly reserved.

For all of these criticisms, Ive said and will continue to say that 12 Years a Slave is a good film.  Its Oscar win is actually understandable under the circumstances.  This was a way for Hollywood to say what was done was wrong on their own terms, and it does get the point across.  Hollywood loves a technically perfect film that allows them to detach and not really feel but still act like they do.",1394668800,,9092,4.459165154264973

With that said, I feel it could have been a much better movie, and even an epic, if it had the backing of a power-house movie studio, and the direction of Steven Spielberg,for example.  I think it made best picture because of the subject matter of the film, not because of the outstanding literary, artistic, and acting qualities that make a film great.
It's definitely a must see movie that will Segway into another great film by Steven Spielberg, Lincoln.  Watch both of these movies over the course of a weekend to understand the significance of Abraham Lincoln's personal and political perseverance concerning the abolishment of slavery, and 12 Years a Slave to drive home the cruelty of slavery in the south.",1394582400,2,854,4.673333333333333

I can't imagine them tolerating a black man that talked like a white northern man and he would have had to change his speech to fit in.  They would have thought him trying to be uppity.  Also they show the northern blacks in these nice little educated family groups who experience no prejudice or social problems fitting in, is that real? Really?  Even though the north didn't allow slavery I cannot imagine them being quite so tolerant in that time in history.  They weren't very tolerant of the Italians, Jews, or Irish either.

Other sources of confusion were: when the overseer saved the hero from being killed and told him not to leave; the next scene shows the other overseer, with whom the hero had had a disagreement, and two other men dragging the hero through the mud to be hanged on a low branch. The good overseer saves him from hanging but leaves him danging, his toes barely touching the ground. Huh?

Several times the scene was too long and you had to wonder why; there was no conversation, just staring into space. I'm pretty sure they could have trimmed :20-:30 minutes from the film.

But that's all this film is at it's core; it's a solid piece across the board but it lacks life.  I felt the writing lacked interesting dialogue that could really give the characters dimension and I wanted so badly to know who these people were!  Audiences are more compelled by someone's suffering if we know about them and know their personalities, what makes them happy, sad, what do they find funny etc.  These core things that can give a character life and dimension end up being glazed over which is a shame because that can make a much more resonating film than what we got.  When suffering is the prime element of what is a very important story, it needs to be balanced out by something a little lighter.  The performances were good but could have been stronger if the writing had allowed for more development.  Michael Fassbender's performance is by far the strongest because amid all the horrific things he does to these human beings, there are moments of self loathing, misery, and even tender feelings towards Patsy creating a fully fleshed out dimensional character.

6060263,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"I was utterly transfixed watching ""12 Years a Slave."" The movie was made in 35 days. Each performance was riveting and the scene where Platt (Solomon's slave name) has to whip Patsey for leaving the plantation to get soap from another plantation is heart-breaking. Michael Fassbender personifies evil as the slave master and lover of Patsey. His wife is equally chilling. The part that struck me the most was the utter quiet in the scenes (very little background noise other than insects chirping). The songs sung by the slaves while working in the fields are alarming and sad; yet, the viewer realizes that singing is probably one of the few ways they had to alleviate the endless toil of picking cotton or cutting sugar cane. The end of the movie is uplifting and sad at the same time. This movie should be shown to high-school students in this country and I highly recommend it.",1394582400,,881,4.7272727272727275

That being said, be forewarned.  This is not a ""feel good"" movie and it is not for the meek.  The depictions of the cruelties to which the characters in the movie were subjected made me feel as though I was right there with them.  It was an uneasy feeling at best and a sickening feeling at worst.  In my opinion, that is the hallmark of a great movie.  It makes you feel.  12 Years a Slave will make you feel something.

6060282,4,B00G4Q3KOC,Amazing in one word. Although difficult to watch at times with some graphic scenes. An incredible story of bravery and survival. Solomon is an inspiration to all to never give up hope and never lose your fight.,1394582400,,210,4.702702702702703

6060284,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"As good as the movie was, and it was good, it just wasn't as good as the book.  That's generally no surprise, because books are almost always better.  Unfortunately, in the movie there was some missing context that was obviously supplied in the book.  I suppose that if you never read the book, you'd give the movie 5 stars.  Read the book, and it automatically goes down to 4.  But, the acting was great, and they deserved their Oscar wins, in my opinion.  I highly recommend doing both, for learning about our American sordid past that should never be repeated.",1394582400,2,563,4.58

Important story, interesting group of characters and definitely makes you feel a range of emotions, but the story was pretty flat at the end and seemed rushed to be wrapped up. You can definitely tell that as a memoir, he quit writing at a certain point. Also felt like Lupita's winning role was much smaller than I expected.

6060294,3,B00G4Q3KOC,"Blame the hype caused by the Academy Award nomination, or maybe a lot of people just hoping this movie would run away with the most acclaims, but I saw it over this weekend, almost 2 weeks after the Oscar night, and I was so disappointed. Chiwetel Ejiofor is a good actor, but he is just good, not great and not amazing. I was really looking forward to watching this movie, more than any other nominated film this year. It just fell flat on its face for me. Where do I begin! I clearly don't think this was the year's best movie, by any stretch. Dallas Buyers Club..just blows this movie out of the water on so many different levels. Both movies had really incredibly moving personal narratives to share, but somehow only DBC came away really leaving a strong impression on me.

I would suggest that anyone interested in this movie also watch 'Amazing Grace (2006)', if they can. The injustice depicted in this movie does make you cringe, is depicted very openly, but I really wish they picked another actor to play Solomon Northup. That character is made to carry the film, but instead seems like a thread in a vast tapestry rather than the moving force behind this labor of love. As I think back, I can count only a few emotions on the actor's face. Sorrow, anger, surprise, anguish, happiness and love. I am just glad I did not go to the movie theater to watch this and instead rented it on Amazon Instant.",1394496000,,1409,4.482490272373541

I had to keep reminding myself that this is a true story from a time when all of the torture and abuse was considered normal and widely accepted. Being born into slavery is bad enough, but being kidnapped and sold into slavery after a life as a free man must have set the bar for a new level of hell.

6060309,3,B00G4Q3KOC,"I am fully aware that movies affect people in different ways, but ""12 Years a Slave"" just did not do it for me.  After months of hearing all the buzz and all the hype, finally having the opportunity to watch it, I just was not that thrilled or impressed.  Now don't get me wrong, it was beautifully shot, the cinematography had me floored, but after I got past that, I found that the acting was just average and the script paltry at best.  There were no standout scenes or performances in my opinion.  Chiwetel Ejiofor was good, but he wasn't great, which showed in his loss of the Academy Award.  Lupita Nyongo'o was okay, but those she was up against in her respected category of Best Supporting Actress from what I've read may have been slightly better.  As long as ""12 Years"" was, the movie was painstakingly slow.  Movies in this genre such as ""Roots"" and ""Amistad"" kept a steady pace and had several pivotal scenes throughout, but this movie almost made me lose interest several times due to its lack of ability to engage.

For me, this movie proves the power of the Hollywood machine at its best.  All it takes is the right people behind a film, namely Brad Pitt and his Plan B company, and a campaign like no other that I've frankly never seen before, and the average can become exceptional.  We've seen this movie before, Hollywood has made this movie before, so what are they telling us that we don't already know or get?  But a movie like ""Fruitvale Station"" that depicts these same ideas and misconceptions and shows that they are still happening today as opposed to 150-something years ago gets no recognition or put on a pedestal to ignite social change.  Definitely there is some work that needs to be done, but until then, I'll just say this movie was okay.",1394496000,,1773,4.540880503144654

I cried (hard) mostly for Patsy.  I cried the following day thinking of her.  I tried to find historical data on ""what became of Patsy"", but there is none.  There is no real record of her life, because she wasn't considered human.  WE weren't considered human.  I know my history quite well and I don't need to see a newer, more violent, more depressing depiction of slavery on screen every other year!

While some of these stories are educational and shed light on (still relevant) issues, I'm beyond exhausted by the narrative of the black woman that keeps replaying itself in popular culture. We are well aware of the injustices we face(d) and we fight silent battles daily, but by no means are we defined by oppression.

6060322,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"An amazing, essential film, probably the best depiction of slavery we have had or are likely to have on film. It is both riveting viewing and a learning experience to even the well read on the subject. The pace is admittedly slow, as if to imitate the motion and sounds of life on a 19th century Southern plantation, barely masking the sheer slo-mo brutality beneath. In a film that focuses on the ordeal of one man, Solomon Northup, sold into slavery and those around him, the film offers many, many insights into the vast institution that entrapped an entire population: from the differing shades of hypocritical and/or psychopathic slaveholder psychology, to the spirits of resistance or accommodation necessarily made by different slaves, to the seeming near impossibility of escape or rescue from a vast landscape of hostile surveillance (though if as fine a film could be made about the Underground Railroad, that would be a fitting accompaniment to this film). The cast is excellent, really bringing these characters to life. I was glad to see that Lupita Nyongo won a well deserved academy award for her portrayal of the slave Patsy, the kind of heartbreaking performance that will long remain with this viewer. Its interesting to note that it took some 73 years for America to travel from bestowing the best picture Oscar to Gone with the Wind (both a great and morally questionable film) to setting the record straight on the plantation experience with this new classic, 12 Years a Slave.",1394409600,2,1498,4.948412698412699

You may talk about the brutality afterwards but that's all. A scary thought since we live in a country where a conservative base is actually asking ""who's next?"". Maybe all of us.

I think the producers, director--whoever--did it a real disservice by making it so long.  My best guess is that they thought the long scenes, some where nothing changed nor was said, lent drama, but they instead just tended to make me lose interest and want to fast forward.  I don't need to be hammered with a concept--I get it--just move on.  Oh......and if I NEVER hear Paul Dano sing again, it'll be too soon!

It is a harrowing story but it has a very well written screen play, wonderful actors, a great director and really good production qualities to get you through it.  It is based on the true story of a free northern black man who is kidnapped and sold into slavery in the pre Civil War south.  While the film is recording his ordeal and that of his fellow slaves it is also reporting on the moral and ethical mores of the slave owners, their white employees and  other white citizens they have contact with.  It is sad to report that I feel there is much truth in all the drama.  It seems very likely that these were the real conditions that both slaves and owners were compelled to live under.  The film once and for all debunks the common canard that slaves were better off before the War and were often treated like ""Family"".  Not any family I'd want to be a part of.

I found myself laughing out loud at the stilted language and inability to muster up a decent deep South accent.  The historical inaccuracies were annoying and misleading.  For example, the plantation house itself wasn't the grand home portrayed in the movie.  It was a small farmhouse, more typical of the poor white farmer of the time trying to get a toehold in the burgeoning cotton industry.  Google ""Solomon Northup"" for a picture of the re-creation of the building itself.

As others have pointed out, this could have been a wonderful movie because Northrup's publication was rich in detail.  In fact, I feel sorry for Steve McQueen.  In terms of quality filmmaking, he was given a huge pass and will now presume he's masterful when in reality he has, imo, a long way to go.",1394409600,20,947,4.725609756097561

One night he meets two men who offer to take him out for a drink and talk about business. When he wakes up the next morning he finds himself chained to the floor. Before he realizes what is happening to him he is shipped to the south and sold into slavery. When his new owner Edwin Epps (Fassbender) starts to break him down Solomon does everything he can to stay strong and fight for his survival and hope for freedom again. I'll start by saying before I watched this movie all I heard was that it should win Best Picture at the Oscars. So I was looking forward to watching this even though I expected it to be brutal and hard to watch in some parts. About halfway through I was left wondering what all the hype was about. The movie, to me at least, seemed very slow and boring. To me this a perfect example of a movie that makes you feel guilty for not liking it. The movie deals with a very important and serious part of history but the movie was really nothing more then look how bad slavery was, over and over. On one hand watching what Solomon goes through is gut wrenching and knowing its a true story makes it that much more powerful. On the other hand when the movie is over and you find out about the rest of his life I couldn't help but thinking if they would have done those events it would have been a better movie. This is not a terrible movie but I thought it was very overrated. Overall, one of the most important movies of the year in terms of subject, but that is different from being the Best Picture of the year. I give it a B.",1394409600,,1673,4.150769230769231

excellent.  Knowing that this is based on a true story makes it more harrowing and knowing that incidents of kidnapping and unbelievable cruelty was a party of our history is truth that is hard to watch.",1394409600,,435,4.623376623376624
6060375,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"The film was beautifully photographed and told a poignant and horrifying story of Solomon Northup who was stolen as a free man and forced into slavery. There were a few places where the atrocities made me close my eyes, but the story needs to continue to be told so future generations don't forget the horrific truth behind it.  Knowing it was based on the book written by Solomon makes it all the more important.  The acting was superb and all those who earned the Oscar were well deserving.",1394409600,,492,4.579545454545454

6060386,1,B00G4Q3KOC,"this movie is nothing more than brad pitt trying to shame the south for its bad history.  The story is very inaccurate in many ways though it was designed to make money, not be historical accurate.  It is good story though allot of it cannot be confirmed but a general actual persons life was made into a movie, not the other way around, which is why this is NOT a documentary but loosly based on an event.  The academy award was a joke, considering to date 2 people voted for it (via the academy awards polling) that never saw the actual movie but liked brad pitt.  It is an ok movie and story, not worthy of an academy award, but very deserving to be in REDBOX.",1394409600,8,663,4.238095238095238

6060401,3,B00G4Q3KOC,"Obviously, this won the best picture of the year so I was expecting greatness. The story is true and of course tragic, as you can imagine. The acting is also impressive. The script is lacking depth however. There is not much done to develop the characters or tell back story to enable the viewer to understand various characters' perspectives. Could have been much better.",1394409600,,372,4.828125

6060404,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"Excellent movie, with stunning performances by every single character. We were left shell shocked after watching this, it was like stepping back in time and watching events unfold was heart breaking. The suffering of the slaves, the sheer arrogance and cruelty of some of the slave ""owners"" and the dignity of Solomon the main character to remain as civilized and as hopeful despite such torture and injustice was just amazing. In my mind, this movie does for slavery what Schindlers List did for the holocaust. Truly an incredible glimpse of history.",1394409600,,551,5.065934065934066

6060413,3,B00G4Q3KOC,This one does more to show the humane attitudes of the whites involved in the evil business.  Also the relationships that Solomon developed with other captives who were enslaved was not shown much in this movie.  The human nature of the enslaved captives was not really shown in this movie,1394323200,,289,4.76
6060414,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"The Motion Picture Academy deservedly honored this film.  Even though I was aware for the brutality of plantation life, I had some difficulty with seeing the brutality.  For that reason, I probably not watch this film again.",1394323200,,224,5.027027027027027

6060416,3,B00G4Q3KOC,"This film could have been much better if it were more accurate about the true relations between Blacks/Whites on the plantations.  Having lived in the Deep South during segregation, the slaves in this film were far too ""uppity.""  The system was designed to totally strip the Blacks of any identity, self-esteem, pride, or initiative.  Whites who opposed the system remained silent if they wanted to stay alive.  Brad Pitt in the film espouses his beliefs to the plantation owner in front of Solomon. This would never have occurred! The film presents a passionate, heartfelt, and sympathetic portrayal of slavery, but even with the vicious cruelty depicted, plantation life was much worse.  If a slave or freeman did not jump from the sidewalk into the muddy street, he could expect to be beaten; a Black man looking a White  directly in the face, was usually met with beatings and continued punishment. The most important error though [and it still exists today in much of the Deep South] Black skin was considered dangerous and there was almost no touching between the races, not even a pat on the shoulder. Steve McQueen and the entire crew deserve the gratitude from everyone who has ever been exposed to this horrendous system.",1394323200,2,1231,4.9227053140096615
6060417,1,B00G4Q3KOC,"There was basically no story here, just a lot of scenes of nasty white crackers being grotesquely sadistic to a lot of helpless black people. it was one violent, sadistic scene after another, over and over, to the point where it seemed beyond gratuitous. It was manipulative and overdone and never once felt believable to me. The acting was bad, with the exception of Brad Pitt's minor appearance and there was almost no character development. The directing and editing was ameteur and the pacing painfully slow. I hated it and my husband hated it and by the time it got to the end NEITHER OF US CARED.",1394323200,10,602,4.635514018691588

We were very happy that we did.  I called our teenage daughter out of her room to watch it with us and I'm very happy that I did because  the message was one that we often preach in our own home regarding racism.  The acting was phenomenal the actors played their parts with expertise and left nothing to be disappointed.  Thank you Amazon for making this movie a choice in your line up we highly recommend this movie to all families especially those with teenagers.

For me, at least, the gratuitous slave beatings were a little unbearable to watch, taking away from the rest of the movie. I'm not sure that I agree that this was the best picture from 2013.",1394323200,,274,4.612244897959184
6060429,3,B00G4Q3KOC,"Although I have some criticisms about the way this film was made, it is worth seeing.  First, the story:  It is about time a film was made that honestly showed the vicious cruelty that can occur when one group of humans owns another and there are no legal or moral constraints to stop them;  congratulations to the filmmakers for both making it and making this point so vividly about the vilest stain on America's history.  Second, the execution:  The actors perform their roles well, but the screenplay, editing and staging of the action fall short;  the screenplay is necessarily episodic, but it could have been constructed more tightly; the editing too is slower than it need be, too many narrative points are made longer than they need be; and finally, the director has very limited imagination or knowledge when it comes to staging action for the camera, framing shots, and choosing lenses to enhance the images in a scene; working with the actors is not enough; a really good director needs to have all these skills.  This is the film's weakness and why I give it only three stars.  Nevertheless, I urge you to see it.  It is haunting.",1394323200,,1142,4.698492462311558

The price is a little steep 5.99 for a rental. I have a big screen smart TV so it was super easy to buy the rental and watch t. You get it on Amazon before you can rent it anywhere else.

So many times the camera just held still on a scene until I thought there was something wrong with the film.  Too many long pauses.  How long did they expect you to look at a guy just staring off into space?  Then they had us looking at a gazebo with some fellow painting it.  Really, did we need to see that?  Wasted film footage for what?  The acting was OK but the actress that won was not even in the film story all that much.  She beat out better actresses for her Oscar.  That is a shame.  As for Brad Pitt being in the movie, I had forgot he was listed as a star.  He never showed up until the very end.  I kept waiting for this movie to really get moving and then it was over.

His family didn't TRY to find him in 12 years??......he didn't try to escape??....he was a wimp and it was hard to CARE about him.....and black people living in such luxury in NY........I DON'T THINK SO!!!  i WASTED MY $5.99
and Hollywood better learn another trade......as they can't make movies worth seeing and this should have been a worthy movie that should have left us drained in it enormity......sort of like ROOTS did!!!

No doubt the movie shows the cruel and horrid part of american history, but it also shows a free educated man with a family with talents. Even though they try to strip him of his diginity and his personality, he eventually (spoiler) finds solace again through a kindness.

But the inherent evil (read: mental instability) of the principal master is over the top dramatically and, some would argue, historically as well.  Some cinematic devises, e.g., added whip snaps, are poorly integrated, and some stares into space are both too prolonged and of no value to moving the story along.  Seeing this film makes one reflect on past efforts to portray the negative impact of slavery (e.g., Ben Hur manning the oars) to identify the most compelling effort.  And doing so makes clear to the non-expert at least that there haven't been many.  (Weren't the slaves in Gone With the Wind reasonably content?)",1394323200,,776,5.03125

The use of flashback was confusing, and his own family very underplayed, they should have been in it more. What did they do when they realized he was gone? How did they cope all those years? Realizing it was based on the book, I think the movie still could have gone a little more outside of the pages to deepen the storyline.

The greedy slave dealers & owners that abetted them many who treated blacks like cattle..or worse in that they were dealing with humans with emotions, families and feelings just like them.  It also underscores the vast difference between the north and south insofar as the issue of slavery was concerned at the time. The director does an incredible job of developing the characters, not rushing from scene to scene, shot to shot, but instead effectively using camera time to focus on faces, the isolation, the sense of hopelessness and degradation. There are parts that are exceedingly difficult to watch; the hangings, the whippings and verbal lashes that cut just as deep but none of it is fiction; it happened and it's worth witnessing if only as scenes in a movie

Now if someone could make equally powerful movie on the defacto slavery that is taking part in every region of today's America, from attempts to defranchise minorities ability/right to vote coupled with the inexplicable decision and reasoning of the Supreme Court to ovverturn the voting rights act, to blaming the victims of poverty and unemployment for their plight, and more.

It didn't tell me anything I didn't already know about how abhorrent the practice of slavery was.  It also didn't let me get to know Solomon.  Most of the characters were too underdeveloped for me to care about them as individuals.  I think this movie missed its mark.",1394236800,10,432,4.283950617283951
6060515,3,B00G4Q3KOC,"Though I like this movie and feels it is in line with the slavery actions within the confederate states before the Civil War, I honestly do not feel this is a movie that is historically worthy of ""BEST PICTURE"" of the year.  Nothing in the story is new, different, suspenseful, cleverly written, or intriguing but is in fact quite easy to predict and similar to a history channel program on slavery in the white south... very easy to predict what will happen next and though its actors were perhaps more worthy of their accolades, this is definitely not a ""Best Picture.""

Now, that said, in comparison, ""The Color Purple"" blows this picture out of the water in every single way possible, by script, by story, by its mere precedence it set and perhaps that is why I have a hard time seeing this as nothing more than a just a one time see, good movie. ""The Color Purple"" I have seen dozens of times and it still moves me to no end.  This picture, though OK, did not do that for me.

Again, worth watching once, but does not live up to a ""Best Picture"" quality.  Just being a slavery story does not and should not,  be automatically chosen as a best picture of the year.

BTW.  SPOILER ALERT:

The part of the movie that was impossible to deal with was at the end where one of the producers of the film 'Brad Pitt' himself appears, and takes on the distinguished role of being the ultimate honest white man and black slave hero of the story. Unnecessary, along with being way over the top (in my opinion.)  It was like Brad Pitt saying, its my movie and I want to be the freedom fighter to save the day!",1394236800,5,1601,4.342281879194631

6060527,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"This movie has great direction and seems more authentic than previous movies, I've seen, depicting slavery. I was really impacted by the scene with Patsy receiving the whipping ordered by the slave owner and the next scene showing the women trying to treat her wounds with no medical person present and no medicines to work with. I felt, emotionally, the pain they were receiving physically and I watched with horror  as the characters suffered grief, constant humiliation and degradation which they endured mentally with the most amazing grace. I was struck by the vacant stares and the incredible strength with which they allowed no emotion to appear on their faces when the masters were present.
If you purchase this movie, and you should, get set...you will be inside the truth of what happened to each person involved. I see why this movie won the academy award for ""Best Picture""",1394236800,,885,4.939597315436242

6060533,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"The true story of Solomon Northrup was brought to life in the mid 1980s with Avery Brooks as Northrup and John Saxon as Epps. The movie directed by Steve McQueen is a stronger portrayal of that mind-numbing episode of his life.

I thought that Michael Fassbender should have gotten an Oscar for his role. Seeing Patsy faint in despair as Solomon drove away solidified her award.

The true story ""12 Years a Slave"" tells is amazing, and like a character tells Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), ""not in a good way."" It's been a while since a movie has evoked such soulful outrage (maybe not since ""Fruitvale Station's"" final twenty minutes) and even though it's hard to watch, there's a distinct underlying worthiness to absorbing it all that's undeniable. What makes ""12 Years a Slave"" mandatory viewing is the equation it uses as its foundation: mindful direction + impactful performances = revelatory story. This is a challenging motion picture that will poke and prod the viewer into submission, but is entirely necessary viewing. When people tell you that in order to understand them you should try walking in their shoes, ""12 Years a Slave"" makes you walk barefoot and feel every stone.",1394236800,,853,5.014084507042254

It is easy as a child in school to see the prim and proper version written neatly in a Social Studies book, but to actually witness what the word means is a whole different experience. This movie takes you through the life of the main character, Solomon. One particular scene sticks out in my mind, when he wakes up and is chained in a cellar like room - you feel that feeling of being scared, abandoned and shocked. The film is excellent and it brings light to the awful things that were permitted and encouraged when slavery was allowed.

This movie is dark, a lot unnecessary nudity, disjointed story, poor casting, poor editing and very poor acting. Chiwetel did not seem connected with the role, there were scenes where we are just staring at the river for like 2 minutes. Lupita had about 5 minutes of acting and won best supporting actress?? there was nothing about Solomon's wife and friends looking for him, no character buildup on Solomon, who was he before he got captured, instead the movie starts with a sex scene in the plantation. Its more of an European movie than American, the irrelevant and boring scenes like watch a man hanging for like 5 minutes and excessive nudity is typical of European movies.

The acting was great, writing good, but the story just isn't one that is enjoying, trans-formative, or adds to anything.  You don't leave the film feeling changed, uplifted, enlightened, or challenged.  I feel like a good movie has to drive something within it's audience other than sadness.  Maybe I just am missing the point.  Also, Brad Pitt just is Brad Pitt. With such a recognizable face, it really pulled me right out of the movie.",1394236800,,613,4.577981651376147

The film was well done and keeps your attention all the way through (although I did have to take a 5 minute break because I was crying so hard during one scene), and the actors/actresses were simply outstanding!  I would say rent it, buy it, borrow it,  share it, but WATCH IT, as it is a story that everyone should see - unless you are a hateful racist in which case you need to just stay home and away from the rest of us with real compassion!

Some ppl may appreciate that sort of realism...it was too late at night for me & i was in the wrong mood to digest this sort of movie. It is one of those movies that you have to be in a receptive mood for, not that there is a ""good"" mood to watch slavery movies but movie buffs should understand what I mean.

I know (from books,classes,plays,film ,documentaries) how horrid slavery was and is (for those of you with stars in your eyes slavery is alive and thriving even here in the USA) but the whole movie was too clean.  Scenes of  people being torn from their loved ones,chained, beaten, whipped were filmed with  such antiseptic care  that one could  dismiss the brutality ad  not that bad.

The slaves were often cleaner than some of the hit henchmen who doled out punishment.

If I had not seem thousands of images of the celebrated actress who won the Oskar I would not have recognized her. Not being familiar with how she and Solomon connected  I thought that she must be the mother who had her two children taken.  I was delighted to see that the costumers did their best to keep the fashion show going with clothing that seemed to be the test partten for dresses she displayed . I .have no reason to think she deserved the award as her role was as wispy as the cotton she picked. We will wait to see how successful she becomes.

6060567,1,B00G4Q3KOC,"As a slavery movie, this movie is so horrible. The only people who do like it are white people who have zero idea what slavery really was and are hoping black people would forget about it as quickly as possible. Why make a mockery of a brutal experience faced by millions of people for 200 years? Why not show us an authentic depiction of it? Last year Django was released and I thought that was more of a depiction of slavery than this one.

In this movie, they lie to us that white people helped free blacks from slavery. As a matter of fact, that was the main point of this movie: whites freed blacks from slavery. The truth, however, is that blacks helped free themselves. Which is why I liked Django Unchained more. I have many friends, black friends who were born and raised here in the south and they all loved Django Unchained because it showed that black people saved themselves from slavery.

White people loved this movie so much because the whites are the heroes. However, I hated it for making a mockery of slavery and for making the white people the heroes. Black people saved themselves from slavery by killing white slavemasters. Don't gloss over that fact. When will a movie about Nat Turner be made?",1394150400,2,1217,4.527272727272727

How Lupita won for best supporting actress is beyond me; her part was nothing more than a ""bit part"" and certainly not worth an oscar.  I just can't get over how bad the acting really was and sometimes it was so bad, it was funny.  Many times I was ready to stop the movie but kept thinking it had to get better but boy was I wrong.

My only criticism of the film is that it does seem to run a little long.

The film gives many insights into the various nuances of the slave's plantation life in terms of things such as the kind master but the cruel overseer, as well as the dangers inherent in being literate.

Living as I do near the setting and filming site of this film, it appears to be very realistically and authentically done.  After seeing it, I once again visited one of the local plantations.  We had a very excellent African American tour guide who shed additional light on the film and the circumstances portrayed.  One interesting and surprising fact that she pointed out was that there were actually more men of color than whites who owned slaves in Louisiana. I subsequently did some more fact checking and that appears to have been true.",1394150400,4,926,4.615853658536586

I really wanted to watch this because with the media hype and the awards, I honestly thought it would be worth watching. But the story was so disjointed it was almost as hard for me to follow it as it was for my 88 year old mother, who watched it with me. It was a very long movie, by Hollywood standards, and yet with all that length, there was a surprising lack of character development. Such a serious lack that after watching it, I still don't really feel any connection with Solomon Northrop (the main character), still don't know anything about his family (except that the wife apparently sat around for 12 years assuming her husband was on an extended trip to the market or something), and don't have any clue how deep the connection ran between Solomon and the female slave, Patsy.

Here's what I know for certain. Hollywood wanted to earn brownie points doing a film about slavery, and denigrating the South and every white person (and a few black ones too) that lived in the South during the days of slavery. Yes, slavery was abhorrent, and yes, there were a lot of evil slave owners. And I'm sure that there were some black slaves who played the system and married their master so they could rise above their station in life (speaking of Alfre Woodard's character). But it's almost as if Hollywood legendary directors/producers (Steve McQueen and Brad Pitt) thought that if they used the ""n"" word often enough, they could call it good historical film making and draw in the box office numbers. And I suppose it worked, given the awards and accolades it has received. But what a farce. It came off feeling more like a political statement than a historical film, and I feel that Hollywood exploited, once again, the man named Solomon Northrop.",1394150400,12,1928,4.601744186046512

6060583,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"I was primarily interested in his story to see what happened in his adventure, a person familiar to me in
our family genealogy. Solomon worked for my great-granduncle on the Champlain/Barge Canal
back in those pre-civil war days and lived in a house quite familiar to me in Fort Edward, NY.
Several of my predecessors lived in the same neighborhood of that now-famed house and little did
I know as a kid, going through that section of town, the history that lurked in those old brick buildings.
The movie was 'cut' too tightly, but then again, to quote someone; ""if the whole story was filmed, it would
take over five hours..""
So I'm satisfied.
Also, I was smart enough to scramble close to the 40-inch flat screen to be able to read the post-story,
because the print might have been big enough for the theater, but not as a vision test for the
home-viewer.

The movie gives lessons about our collective history as a nation that we should not forget. The imagery is realistic and the performances convincing. The movie was difficult to watch in spots. It drug at times. There were long interludes of silence. Just what our fast-paced, thoughtless culture needs more of. It is good to be reflective.

This movie is not for every one, particularly children. It is graphic and honest in its violence and nudity. People suffered indignity in slavery and this movie portrays that in a realistic manner.",1394150400,3,754,4.792307692307692
6060589,2,B00G4Q3KOC,"This is a very strange film.
First of all, I agree with reviewers that despite everyone saying how groundbreaking this is, it isn't. If you combine Roots, Color Purple, and Django Unchained, even toss in Uncle Tom's Cabin, there is nothing new here at all. This has all been done on screen before. Especially Django Unchained. If you have seen that movie, this one suffers big time in comparison. Django was much better, and as far as I'm concerned, conveyed the horrors of white ownership much better. There is nothing new or original in THIS film.
Second of all, I found Chiwetel Ejiofor, who I love, grossly misued and wasted. I swear to God, all he had to do was look distressed in about a million scenes. To the point where I just felt this leaden sinking feeling whenever he got on screen. His character, or how he was portrayed, was very problematic.
Third, the way the director lingers on the sadistic violence. We know it happened. It's not like NO ONE'S ever shown or written about slave whippings before! So what was the intent with being so incredibly fascinated by it in this film? These sadism scenes have a lot in common with The Last Temptation of Christ. You feel like you are being drawn into some kind of porno violence scenario. Seems like that's the true intent here--enacting some fantasy scenario on the part of the director or writer. Who just happens to have set it in the world of slavery.
On top of everything, I agree with reviewers who say it is boring. Leaden paced. Disjointed. Not enough about Solomon Northtrup. Waaay too much focus on the Michael Fassbender character.

Nat Turner's rebellion, bleeding Kansas and the Civil War were more obviously violent aspects of this story but the institutionalized violence to millions held in bondage was a massive horror and this film shed some a ray of light on the centuries of terrible darkness.

Director McQueen has a fine eye for the beautiful shot - clearly a still photographic artist - and this is juxtaposed with the heart-rending narrative of a free man casually brutalized by the awful system.

Similar to Schindler's List in a way, in that it's important material that's well-acted and deeply moving, but also very tough to get through in places. That comparison isn't completely fair, of course. Though Chiwetel Ejiofor serves well in the leading role and Lupita Nyong'o is memorable (if one-note) in support, there is no Liam Neeson-level central performance in this picture and the cast very quickly falls into camps of good and evil with little middle ground. Michael Fassbender fares best as the deeply troubled alcoholic slave-owner Epps, but he's present largely to be despised and as such his character lacks a thorough inspection. The other name actors, shoehorned in as bit roles, only serve to distract. We can slap an Amish beard on Brad Pitt and throw him onto a plantation, but it's still Brad Pitt in those suspenders and there's no getting around that.

on some commentary which I read in the media, I was anticipating a lot more violence in the film. In comparison,
I have felt a lot more uncomfortable watching films involving Nazi atrocities against Jews during the Holocaust.
I feel that the amount of nudity among slaves was very good because it made me feel that the slaves were being
treated like cattle on a ranch. I consider this film to be similar to the Jewish Holocaust in importance, and in
remembering that this story reflects an undeniable  part of America's history. I also thought that the use of the

6060642,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"Based on the book by the same name penned by Solomon Northup whose biographical date is important to note: Born a free man in New York, Northup was drugged and kidnapped in Washington, D.C. in 1841 and sold into slavery there. He was soon taken with other slaves by ship to New Orleans and sold into further slavery. He eventually came into contact with a Canadian abolitionist, who was able to notify his family of his whereabouts. In 1853, after the intervention of an official agent of the state of New York, he was freed. He filed charges against his kidnappers but after a long trial, the charges were dropped on legal technicalities and Northup was never compensated for his years in slavery. He orally related his story to a New York legislator, David Wilson, who published it in a book titled `12 Years A Slave.' The book was published less than a year after Northup's freedom and it sold over 30,000 copies. He is believed to have died in 1863. The original book was transformed into a screenplay by Ridley Scott for the cinematic version directed by Steve McQueen.

The incredible true story of one man's fight for survival and freedom is disturbing to see and is a fine reminder of the horrors of man's inhumanity to man - slavery - that still exists today. In the pre-Civil War United States, Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free black man from upstate New York, is abducted and sold into slavery. Facing cruelty (personified by a malevolent slave owner, portrayed by Michael Fassbender), as well as unexpected kindnesses, Solomon struggles not only to stay alive, but to retain his dignity. In the twelfth year of his unforgettable odyssey, Solomon's chance meeting with a Canadian abolitionist (Brad Pitt) will forever alter his life. The significant polar roles between evil and good are well played by Benedict Cumberbatch, Liza j. Bennet, Sarah Paulson, Lupita Nyong'o, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Alfre Woodard, Garret Dillahunt among a cast of thousands.

The film is overly long, dwells on only the brutality to slaves, and fails to give us background on the most important characters - especially Solomon Northup. It is a very dark song, necessary to remand the world of the crime of slavery, but lacking in moments of light that allow the audience see the history clearly and to make the arc of the story more dramatic.

A movie about a free black man who is drugged and sold into slavery for the next twelve years of his life.  For the actress who played Patsy and the actor who played his Master the longest (I can't remember his name), they were the best of the bunch in this movie.  The lead actor was trememdous!  He gave pain throughout this movie, and total relief when he was finally freed from his bondage, with the help of an Austrialian, played by Brad Pitt.  After the movie ends, there are some written facts about Solomon that made me even madder.  All in all, this was a powerful flick and not to be forgotten.",1394064000,,680,4.307086614173229

The main character is especially dismayed that he was a free man in the north, as if that were different from being a free man in Africa when taken as a slave. It is amusing that exec producer Pitt casts himself as the kindly white man who mails a letter from the main character to family in the north, which leads to him being freed.

6060657,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"It was an extremely well made movie. From the wardrobes, settings and crispness of the picture quality to the performance of the cast and weaving of the story's time line. The best part of the movie is the story itself, classic, meaningful, emotionally painful, cerebral and redemptive.

The director took pity on his audience (me) by not graphically depicting every bit of violence yet ensured that we understood the overwhelming violent nature of slavery. Thus making the movie not difficult to watch unlike many movies about American Slavery. The extremely complex and difficult choices our protagonist faces from the beginning to the very end of the film are brilliantly depicted.  Oh, the consequences of decisions we make.  I think about the ending often.

To anyone interested in a couple of hours of cinematic pleasure, to anyone who wants their heart tugged, who wants to feel the presence of the human spirit, I recommend they watch 12 Years a Slave!!  You will not remember my review, but you will remember the movie!!  I think about it often, even now, several days since watching it.

6060661,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"I must honestly say that this was the best movie I've seen this year. Unfortunately it is being ""debunked"" by so-called experts who have no idea what they are talking about. William Seay's One-Star review comes to mind. He harps on ""honest depictions of slavery"" as if one's bondage was a vacation instead of atrocity; or that ""it wasn't as bad as they make it out be.""

I'm glad that movies are being made by Hollywood in this genre. This is not a movie that would have been made 30 years ago. Yet not only was it made it was made with an adroit aplomp. I highly recommend this movie to students of history and also those who have yet to learn about this terrible time in American history. The savagery of the American South just like that of Nazi Germany will always stain those places.

I won't go into too much detail on the plot. Others have done a better job of that than I could. I will say that the actors are fantastic. Fassbender put himself right up there with Ralph Fiennes (Schindler's List) as despicable villains. He truly deserved an Oscar for his portrayal. He made me believe he was a Southern slave owner. His brutal savagery belied a multilayered-character who ruled his fiefdom with an iron fist. He would not let any of his slaves be taken from him and this is depicted with absolute preciseness in the end of the movie. When I looked into his face on screen I saw the faces of Stacy Koon and Laurence Powell. Absolute pure evil. He sold it well in his portrayal. After only a moment of screen time I hated him. Ironically, his wife may have been even more evil than he was.

View this movie and you will see a side of America many (William Seay & K. Hemmerling) want to deny. See Seay's One-Star review and the accompanying posts to see what I mean.

My review is the 171st Five-Star review and the 286th overall.

6060662,2,B00G4Q3KOC,"I found this film offensively racist. Not black racist, WHITE racist. Every white person, male or female was shown as a sadistic monster. Only a Jesus figure, coincidentally portrayed by a producer of the film, one Brad Pitt, showed any kindness. There was far too much gloating lingering on the wounds of the whipped slaves.
The budget for this movie was considerably increased by a million dollars' worth of CATSUP.
The ending, where we needed to know what happened on the captured slave's return to a remarried wife, was abruptly cut off.
This film - intended to redress the balance between the so-called 'false' image of slaves in Gone With The Wind, including loveable Mammy, - went much too far in the opposite direction. What this film lacks is a sense that slavery (however wicked and misguided) was an accepted part of life in USA for 245 years. I felt the underlying motive of the film was to generate hate amongst black people for white. Unfortunately, the Academy always falls for a politically correct view, however entertaining or not the film is. Personally, I love to see black actors, directors, writers excelling at their art on a subject other than the cruelty and racism shown to them and their forbears. You know, just for a change...",1394064000,5,1255,4.814814814814815

It amazes me how the whites hated blacks, but we cooked for them, took care of their children and their men slept with the black women. Even today it still happens and more accepted by some more than others. This movie represents years of slavery, freedom and a call to what is right.....JUSTICE!",1393977600,,461,4.488095238095238
6060664,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"This is a starkly powerful film about an especially shameful era in our history. It is based on the true story of Solomon Northrup, a free black man from New York, who was kidnapped and sold into slavery, serving under two different masters in Louisiana for 12 years. The original autobiography by Northrup was independently researched and found to be essentially true. Director Steve McQueen has taken some liberties with Northrup's story for dramatic effect; but it is essentially faithful to the original. The biggest liberty taken is the harsh treatment of Christianity. Northrup was a devout Christian and his faith continued while he was a slave; even helping him to endure his often brutal treatment. While Biblical texts were used (wrongly) by slave owner to justify slavery, Christianity was also the basis for the abolition of slavery. Like other historical films that depict brutality - ""Schindler's List"", ""The Passion of the Christ"", etc - this film is difficult to watch - especially the brutal beatings that took place - but like ""Schindler's List"" and ""Passion"", it was a box office hit and has garnered numerous awards. While Lupita Nyong'o, in her feature film debut, won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, the strongest performances are by Chiwetal Ejiofor as Northrup; and Michael Fassbender as the sadistic slave owner, Edwin Epps. Also look for strong support performances by Benedict Cumberbatch, as Northrup's first relatively benevolent owner; Sarah Paulson as Mary Epps; Paul Giamatti as a slave dealer; and Paul Dano as a plantation toady who lords it over Northrup. If you are not well versed on slavery in America, this film would be a good place to start...it is exceptional cinema!",1393977600,3,1715,5.106761565836299

Actually ""Roots"" gave a better picture of the situation while leaving out the worst of cutting edge reality.  Why those who got Academy Awards got them is kind of puzzling.  They were very good performances; not great.
While I felt it drug a little; maybe the result was the feeling of being trapped and hopeless.  It would do many of us a lot of good to see and realize the brutality and mental anguish it actually was and that even as now, the perpetrators go unpunished.

6060672,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"This movie is so  heart retching, bittersweet, and sadly so true.  It gives visual image of the horrific stain in American history that some people would rather dismiss and/or put void emphasis on the demoralizing effect it had/has on people of color.  This movie gives visual image to the cruelty on black men, black women, and their children throughout the nineteenth century.  It tells the story of the struggle and courage of a free black man who is kidnapped and sold into slavery. His story unfolds telling how he tried to grasp the idea of how someone could be so cruel to not think of him as a man and sell him into slavery; his struggle in trying to understand the ""why's"" of slavery; his struggle in trying to regain his freedom in a society that would rather keep him enslaved and treated as chattel.  This question continued to ponder me as I watched this movie ""What right does a man have to make another man a slave?"".  After watching this excellent 'biography/documentary', I was compelled to read other narratives written by other slaves; Frederick Douglass, Harriett Jacobs.... Their stories also validates the same atrocities they experienced that is so dramatically illustrated in this movie.

6060676,2,B00G4Q3KOC,"I watched this movie and I saw ""Oscar bait"". Heavy emotional subject that appeals to the morality of it's audience, well-respected actors with BIG performances, tearful endings filled with redemption and forgiveness... it's ""Schindler's List"" all over again.  The fact is, ""Schindler's List"" was more than just better- it was more original.  I simply don't agree with these glowing reviews at all.

To be clear, I'm not talking about the subject of slavery here- the cruelty and injustice of this brutal stain on our American history.  Nor am I undermining the experience (whatever it was) of the real author of the story.  I'm only speaking about this as a film, and, in my opinion, to reward a film simply for tackling a challenging subject is wrong. It should be based on how well it's tackled.

It's arc is the experience of it's main character, and to this there's very little to the story.  12 years can be summed up in a short sentence.  Instead, it's padded out to over two hours, during which time we're fed with the all-star line up of Oscar-caliber performers cast unnecessarily in smaller roles (Michael Williams fans will be disappointed in his screen time here), lots of teary-eyed melodrama and raging racism, and cleanly-shaven actors playing slaves that get beaten for a bar of soap.

I know I'm in the minority here (I'm sure I'll give the film a second chance in the not-too-distant future) I just feel that if you're going to make another film about slavery, I need to see more than all that's preceded it.  In general, I saw this film as attempting to manipulate it's audience (including the Oscars judges) by using a proven cinematic template.",1393977600,6,1665,4.810526315789474
6060677,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"I have read through many reviews and opinions of this film, and I'm genuinely more disturbed by the reaction of those who find the graphic violence and morbidity of it too much to take more than the morbidity of the film itself.  Steve McQueen honored the story of Solomon Northup and slavery by being courageous enough to depict the range of depravity that we humans are capable of without sugar coating.  Some felt it was cold and distant, but I for one didn't need a feel good back story to get through the viewing.  What rang true to me and  what is the ultimate feel good story is how Blacks survived through all that hell and torment and are still here today. For those of you missing the point and stating that Blacks should just get over ""it"", you need to understand that as long as there are opportunities for  certain groups or segments of the human population to be exploited for greed and power, the horror stories of slavery will always be needed as a reminder of how not to treat each other.  I fear the untold real truth of what really happened to Black slaves in the South can never be told as those unconscionable acts were taken to the grave with many.  This film has the capacity to continue the dialogue about race, class and power in this country for those who are not afraid to go there.  Given that the effects of slavery are still present today, that dialogue is still much needed. I would offer that the documentary called ""Slavery by Another Name"" is also another important piece to watch as it tells the lesser known story of what really happened to so called freed Blacks after the Emancipation Proclamation and drives home the fact that slavery can exist and still exist under different guises.  We owe it to each other as human beings to be able to take an unflinching look at the darker side of our nature in order to rise above it and elevate human consciousness for years to come.",1393977600,4,1913,4.474137931034483
6060678,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"first of all, the critical vertex of the west african, caribbean, southern colonial slave trade was sustained by african vendors, not by european raiders.  at least we are spared that fallacy, but then, hollywood is NEVER to be trusted with historical themes (as; marcus aurelius and commodus were real emperors, but they had nothing whatever to do with one another, or a general ""maximus"").  as a novelty, naive solomon gets himself drugged stupid and chained in washington dc (still a common event), then shipped to georgia.  the usual played to death spectacles of cruelty ensue; and frankly, those can be found anyplace you care to look, although ordinarily in a less organized scheme.  cinema is good, and acting, and direction; music is not only not intrusive, but barely noticeable.  as for storyline, 12yrs is a broadly played melodrama, punctuated with heavily sketched villains and victims...and little else.  the fact that it lends itself to such a simplified treatment seems to have captivated mcqueen himself.  there are few of the nuances that mark the real cinema masterpiece.  i concede its points of excellence, but if it managed a best film, game must have been very thin on the ground this year.",1393977600,,1214,5.035

6060684,1,B00G4Q3KOC,"READ the NY Times ARTICLE - Do NOT waste your money on the movie!!!!!!!!
1st of all - the entire movie (the screen/picture) was soooo dark that it was difficult to watch.  The beginning was very confusing ie: if I had not read the NY times article from 1853 I would have had no idea what was going on when the female slave was beside Solomon during the night!?! Why was this shown in the beginning anyway?? According to the NY times narrative, the movie skipped a lot of the most important parts of the story.  It SHOULD have put much, much more emphasis at the end of the movie as Solomon strives for justice and what the end result/s were...instead of portraying this very important part, there were a few lines in small print telling about the ending of the story. VERY DISAPPOINTED. After watching the movie, my husband asked me if we could get our money back (I purchased the DVD). I do not understand how this could have been voted #1 movie for the academy awards??!!??  The only good acting I saw were the couple of scenes with closeups of Solomon's facial expressions without dialog. The movie ""Roots"" in my opinion was excellent and this one was a total let down.  I had high hopes of this movie because of all of the ""hype"" thinking that it would be a great educational tool for the children of today who do not REALLY seem to understand slavery. I believe every person on earth should have the opportunity to know, to understand the horrible injustice of slavery and how it REALLY was good, bad or indifferent.  This movie left too much to the viewer's imagination...sooooo many questions left unanswered...

HAD THIS MOVIE NOT BEEN BASED ON AN ACTUAL EVENT, I WOULD HAVE RATED IT EVEN LOWER THAN ONE STAR!!!

How in the world are the younger generations going to actually understand the whole horrible concept of slavery if movies of this caliber are what they see???????

I believe the movie ""Amazing Grace"" gave a more clear, actual visual aid as to what slavery REALLY was like. We need to know the nitty-gritty as in the movie, Amazing Grace touched on such as showing how the people/slaves were transported in those inhumane ships, all of the unspeakable types of chains, cuffs, leg irons, iron neck braces hooked onto chains, etc.

I would very much appreciate an actual documentary type film on the subject of slavery which shows EVERY ASPECT from inception, deception, misunderstanding and get to the ""roots"" of it.  Every person NEEDS a ""COMPLETE PICTURE"". Without such an education, NO-ONE can speak intelligently or answer their children's questions without 'ALL' of the facts!!!  Come on moviemakers...get it right!! We all NEED the aforementioned education otherwise how can we EVER understand what actually went on during that dark period in history...I personally as I said previously, want to KNOW the good, the bad, the indifferent, etc.  In other words, I want the WHOLE TRUTH!!!!

6060696,1,B00G4Q3KOC,"For all of the media hype and talk show discussions I fail to see how anyone can give this dreck anything more than a one star review.

Just by the title I knew that this movie was about slavery. However, I thought that this story would be more dynamic and reveal facets of slavery that have not been mentioned in previous films. I was sorely mistaken on both counts.

The only facet of slavery that this film revealed is how this man became a slave. I won't spoil this revelation, you'll have to watch the film or have someone else tell you.

Maybe I missed the scene or part of the scene, but I don't remember what explaination was given for why Northrup's family was leaving on a trip in one of the first scenes of this film.

Flash backs were used obsessively throughout the film but it seemed that the interpretation of the flash backs were left up to the viewer.

From the time that Northrup became a slave up until he was rescued from being a slave, the time that Northrup spent in slavery and the duration of his time spent at any given plantation was not mentioned. While the duration of Northrup's enslavement is the title of this film, how long he spent at any given location within the 12 years is indeterminable.

The relationships between Northrup and other characters are not well explained. One such instance is when the ""Master"" asked Northrup's advice. For example, how did the master come to know that Northrup was anything other than a field slave?

The majority of the characters were not well developed or well defined. In more than one instance Northrup had provoked the animus of a few of the characters. For the most part, there was no mention of what Northrup had done/said that led up to the animus.

Perhaps the message that these situations might be interpreted is that these white men simply hated Northrup because of his color. This explaination appears to be as good any since the majority of these situations were not explained, either through dialog or by Northrup's interactions with the character(s).

I wonder what an individual, who was not well versed in ""American"" slavery history, would think about this film.

The absolute best result of buying this DVD is that taking my wife to see this film would have been more expensive than simply buying it.

Bottom line, for me, watching this film was a struggle. The only reason that I watched the entire DVD was that I was hoping that the film would get better as it progressed. Unfortunately, I was wrong. That's 2+ hours of my life that I will never get back.",1393977600,16,2546,4.58590308370044

The South and its' idea of ownership of people of course came from Europe's ideals towards the freedom of laborers.  It is a fact that you can bring up a child thinking all that is wrong in human behaviors is natural unless of course you have a child who can and does think for himself.  The past and present years of how we see each other; black vs white, is still very evident in how we judge each other's values as persons.  The story showed a good slave owner who had to release his favorite slave to another slave owner who was a horrible man and made life meaningless for his slaves.

6060700,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"""12 Years A Slave"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: In the pre-Civil War United States, Solomon Northup, a free black man from upstate New York, is abducted and sold into slavery. Facing cruelty at the hands of a malevolent slave owner, as well as unexpected kindnesses, Solomon struggles not only to stay alive, but to retain his dignity. In the twelfth year of his unforgettable odyssey, Solomon's chance meeting with a Canadian abolitionist will forever alter his life.

The cast led by Chiwetel Ejiofor (in a brilliantly, superb Oscar-nominated performance as Solomon), Michael Fassbender (equally brilliant in an unnerving and jarring (as well as Oscar-nominated) performance as Epps) & Lupita Nyong'o (in an emotionally-charged and brilliantly-crafted Oscar-winning performance as Patsey), alongside Benedict Cumberbatch (as Ford), Paul Dano (as Tibeats), Paul Giamatti (as Freeman), Sarah Paulson (as Mistress Epps), Alfre Woodward (as Mistress Shaw) & Brad Pitt (who was a producer, as well) (as Bass) is brilliant. The directing by Steve McQueen (who also was a producer) is brilliant. The screenplay (Oscar-winning) (based on Solomon Northup's novel) by John Ridley (who also was an executive producer) is brilliant.

The music by Hans Zimmer is brilliant. The cinematography by Sean Bobbitt is brilliant. The (Oscar-nominated) film editing by Joe Walker is brilliant. The casting by Francine Maisler is brilliant. The (Oscar-nominated) production design by Adam Stockhausen is brilliant. The art direction by David Stein is brilliant. The (Oscar-nominated) set decoration by Alice Baker, set dressings by Kenneth Chauvin, Walter Dickerson, Zachary Dickerson, Greg Harney, Joie Todd Kerns, Michelle Lacayo, Kevin C. Lang, Erik Malkovich, Siobhan O'Brien, Alixandra Petrovich, Shelly Sanchez & Gordon Thomas, set designs by Matthew Gatlin, Walter Schneider, Carl Sprague & Jim Wallis is brilliant. The (Oscar-nominated) costume design by Patricia Norris is brilliant. The special effects coordinated by David Nash is brilliant. The visual effects coordinated by Elbert Irving IV & Katie McCall & supervised by Tim LeDoux & Dottie Starling is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Andy Dylan, Lex D. Geddings & Steven Ritzi is brilliant.

This is a brilliantly, well-made and well-crafted movie that is entertaining, at times, if unnerving and unflinching, considering the movie's subject matter. Steve McQueen, has to date, made one of his best pictures, if not, his best movie, of his career, thus far. Michael Fassbender also gives another well-crafted and unflinching performance in another one of Steve McQueen's films. Chiwetel Ejiofor gives a career-defining performance as Solomon & Lupita Nyong'o gives a career-making performance in her film debut as Patsey. This is one of the best movies of last year and last fall, as well. This was a well-deserved winner for the Best Picture Oscar, among the other many awards that the film had so deservedly had won during the awards season.",1393891200,,3006,5.4881209503239745

6060702,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"Based on the tragic true story, 12 YEARS A SLAVE follows freeman Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who gets kidnapped and taken south.  He first winds up in the service of a comparatively benevolent owner, before winding up with the cruel and troubled Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender).  The film chronicles Northup's resistance against his chains, this his acceptance, and subsequent struggle to reattain his freedom.

Director Steve McQueen has given us some brutally honest films in the past; both HUNGER and SHAME are extremely hard to watch at times.  So it's surprising that SLAVE isn't quite as brutal.  Oh, don't get me wrong: McQueen and company don't shy away.  And neither, at times, does the camera.  But over everything, there's a certain gloss that just screams ""Oscar!""  It isn't very loud (note the four stars), but it's there.

That aside...what holds this film together is the integrity of its script, the cinematography (as awful as it may sound, this is truly a beautiful film), and the caliber of its performances.  Elijiofor's performance will come as no shock to those who've followed his career; he anchors this two-hour character study, nailing every nuance.  What comes as a pleasant surprise is the caliber of acting from the supporting parts.  Fassbender gives his character genuine depth; the most appalling thing about Epps is his humanity.  Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano, Garret Dillahunt...even producer Brad Pitt gets in on the action for a couple scenes.  Yet, aside from Fassbender, it's newcomer Lupita Nyong'o who gets the spotlight (and Oscar) as the oft-abused slave Patsey.  Her role is small, but it does stand out from a superfluous cast of people wanting to get in on the action.

I can't go so far as to say we haven't seen a film like this before.  But what I can say is, 12 YEARS THE SLAVE is a relatively unflinching look at a dark part of American history (and also the world's present, though few people seem to be addressing that).  There's a good bit of pandering going on here, but at the heart is an honest film that aims to tell the unveiled truth.

6060718,3,B00G4Q3KOC,"Note : I did change this review after watching this film a second time.  I tried to review it as a historical interpretation, moreso than as popular entertainment.

This is a story well worth being told.  The writing hits it out of the park, particularly within the first 30 minutes or so.  It illustrates the sickness of slavery, from various angle and dimensions, powerfully and viscerally.  Fairly brilliant writing.

After that the movie settles down into Solomon Northop's story.  It's a period piece, not popular entertainment.  It ebbs and flows and has a strong ending.

The photography is beautiful, and the performances solid.  I'd cite Michael Fassbinder as giving the standout performance here.  He and Paul Dano's characters are the most interesting point of the movie to me; the way that the slaves' lives are so badly affected by their captors' desires and insecurities and foibles.  That level of sickness is presented here, full-on.  Chiwetel Ejiofor's performance carries the movie well.

Luipta Nyong'o's performance is not so good ... frankly I think that the Oscar voters got the character and the actress confused here. If she can act, I haven't seen evidence of it yet.

I don't think that Steve McQueen was a good director for this film.  His primary interest is in suffering - sado-masochism dressed up as art.  In his films, he generally tries (as do other sadists such as Lars von Trier and Michael Haneke) to inflict pain on his audience - to make them watch something horrific.  That approach makes sense for parts of this film; McQueen doesn't flinch from showing what's horrible in this story.  But he also, to my eyes, inflicts an S&M fetish this film, inappropriately.  A rape/choking scene that we didn't need to watch.  An extreme whipping scene.  Some fetishizing of darkness and captivity.  And worst (to my taste) the exaggerated standing-on-tiptoes-for-hours lynching scene here, that makes it impossible to take this film as seriously as it should be taken.  He was the wrong man for this job and IMO keeps this film from being as effective as it should have been.",1393891200,12,2104,4.945714285714286

While many viewers have lamented the vivid brutality of the film - and indeed there are numerous lingering close-ups of the vicious carnage inflicted upon these poor people - the film is still an important examination of the various ways slaves suffered. From the emotional devastation of being relentlessly subjugated without a family to the ferocious physical torture, the film does an excellent job of studying the wages of these horrors upon a human soul. The filmmakers and actors strive to capture every nuance to the slave trade that many might not have know ever existed - from the mouth chains and sales parlors, to the sleeping arrangements and competitiveness for a master's favor.

This is not a feel-good and joyful experience, but I think anybody who watches the film is only the better for it by a wiser understanding of this sad chapter in American history.",1393804800,4,1060,5.0227272727272725

6060749,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"So I saw both Dallas Buyers Club and 12 years.  Jared Leto won the Best Supporting for DBC, but Fassbender deserved it.  However I understand why he didn't win.  Because the decision makers for the Academy probably felt the same way I did.  That no human being with a conscience could play the Epps character so convincingly.  Seriously, if I were Fassbender, I would forbid any friends or family from watching this.  Its impossible not to see him as the character, and if I knew Fassbender personally, I would never be able to look him in the eye after seeing this.

Sarah Paulson as his wife is also despicable, but in a more feminine and passive aggressive way.

There are no truly redeeming white people in this movie.  Even the allies are guilty in some way or another.  The slaves are too at some points, but they at least have the redeeming quality that they are trying to save their own skins.  This is the only reason Id give it 4 instead of 5 stars.  It started to actually feel kind of racist to me to people of lighter and darker skin color.  I didn't feel like I was enlightened in any way; and there is no new material discussed in the movie.  The main character  did not stand out to me.  The supporting cast (especially the Patsy character) were so much more dynamic than Solomon himself - that is one woman's opinion folks, please don't start ranting at me.  Alfre Woodard's character (who plays a very small scene in this movie ) seemed as pertinent to me than the other players of the story.

As was the case with Hunger and Shame, there are some quiet parts and some gaps that viewers just need to fill in on their own.  McQueen never gives us all the information we need, because it often isn't necessary to the story.  However, unlike those movies, there is nothing subtle about what is going on in the background and foreground during the quieter moments.  Theres a particularly painful lynching scene, that I actually squinted and looked away from  just to assure myself that Im still a good person having continued watching it.

I would never hire John Ridley, based on what happened to the film. Steve McQueen is also very overrated. This movie will likely be forgotten in a few years.

What also bothers me, is that the story may not even have been true. The real guy was supposed to have been a con man, not a musician. So when a con man writes a book about how he was captured and enslaved, I start to raise questions. You know?

Lupita Nyong'o also was not that great. I can't even remember her performance. She just played the tortured black slave that didn't do much other than get harassed by Fassbender's character. Give me a break, you will not hear from her in a few years, guaranteed.",1393718400,11,944,4.514619883040936

6060758,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"People compare this movie to Roots.  While that might be a bit lazy, the comparison is not without merit, and it's no insult.  I was a teenager when I watched Roots in the '70's, and it was the first thing I had seen that put a humanizing face on slavery.  If there had to be only one thing that served as a generation's touchstone for understanding slavery, you could have done worse than Roots.  In that sense, I can see 12 Years a Slave being Roots for this generation.  In fact, I hope it is.  It would be hard to absorb this movie and not come away with a more visceral sense of the thorough evilness of American slavery.
Not that there aren't substantial differences.  This movie lacks the generational breadth of Roots.  It is the story of one man who did not come into slavery in the most common way, and in some ways it is more powerful for it, as you come to care deeply for this one man.  Some might argue that we care more for him because he had a good life before it was taken away, and we ought to accord as much humanity to people who were born into slavery.  We should, and if we don't, it says more about us than it does about this movie.
The second difference (and here I am comparing 12 Years a Slave to my distant memories of Roots) is that it is better.  Better written, filmed, and acted.  Quite beautiful, actually, when it isn't portraying ugliness.  My favorite thing about 12 Years a Slave is that it is artful as opposed to being heavy handed.  There are no soliloquies about yearning for freedom or the evils of slavery (though Brad Pitt's character comes close) because the story and the acting make those things abundantly clear, and any attempts to drive those points home through dialogue could have diminished them.  People eventually made fun of some of the dialogue in Roots.  I don't see that happening here.  (Family Guy might.)

6060760,1,B00G4Q3KOC,"The complex horrors of the movie, 12 Years A Slave directed by Steve McQueen, shamefully reflect an evisceration of African Americans that is encouraged and perpetuated by this heavy-handed, insensitive, amateurish production.
A typical response, current in a number of circles, is that the movie is true to the book.  And, it almost is, to an embellished (student-perception-of-Hollywood) extent.  The book, however, was not written by the enslaved freeman Northrup.  It was written by a fully enfranchised white American who restated Northrups experience.  A look at the environment of that time clearly shows that the book was written for a white audience and played into stereotypical expectations.  Blacks of that era were killed for being able to read!!
Shunning the chance to enlighten the movie audience regarding the literary customs surrounding slave narratives, and perhaps to enhance our understanding of the culture of the day, McQueen chooses insteadwith fabrications and stereotypesto further damage and defame the character of a people who were by nature, the very embodiment of love and trust, a people who he very obviously does not understand, notwithstanding the color of his own skin.
American cinema has presented sufficient whipping scenes for audiences to recognize and understand the horror of whipping.  How dull it is to have to be explicit about whipping a human to get the feeling across to an audience.  Such a choice shows the creative limitations of the director.  In the film Short Eyes a view of the acts of the pedophile is not needed to make the point; neither do we see the pretty head of Anne Boleyn rolling across the carpet to register the horror of her beheading.  One of the most poignant and emotional experiences captured in literature comes at the end of The Last of the Just, by Andre Schwarz-Bart where each sentence is simply the name of a concentration camp punctuated by a period.  It is powerful and emotional; there was no need to see the death process or to describe the effects.  The movie Its a Beautiful Day also makes an indelible impact without gore.  Adding insult to ignominious injury, McQueen whips a helpless, enslaved woman mercilessly, on camera!  I was outraged as a part of the audience, shamed as an African American and insulted as a 21st Century woman.
12 Years A Slave (12 YAS) is an abomination if it purports to be anything except more icing on the rotten, racist American cake of slavery.  I truly understand why a British filmmaker was chosen for this film:  no culture-conscious African American would have made it in its current format.
I had to fight the likes of Montel Williams (who extols the movie) throughout the civil rights battles for respect at lunch counters; they were people who had no concept of personal dignity in relation to human rights. Whatever they were told by the power holders was their guiding light.  In this instance, Hollywood power holders dictate that 12 YAS is a powerful movie and here comes the chorus foolishly tooting that it should be shown in schools.  I am appalled.
Children are not able to fill in the cultural blanks left by 12 YAS regarding the struggle of African American individuals to maintain their humanity in a dehumanizing environment, to resist the impulse to commit vengeful acts in the face of personal violation, to rely on God and maintain faith in a world that severely tests every aspect of ones being, to put ones life on the line to assist others who dare to make an effort to escape in search of a better way of life.  In contrast, such a careless presentation as 12 YAS merely shows children an enforcement of negativity and encouragement of disrespect, because such a presentation is inevitably taken at face value by the young, the ignorant and the thoughtless.
The basic premise of this movie, that Northrup was grossly mistreated, given no credit for being human and finally freed at the whim of his white benefactors through no effort of his own, adds a racist color of foolishness to Northrup and leaves its audience hanging.  There is no payoff.  The obvious perpetrators are glossed over as concerned associates.  Despite their despicable action, McQueen paints them in friendly colors and does not overtly identify them as villains, except that Northrup is sold for heightened value, then we see him playing music for his captors, who magically knew of his musical talent.  Either way, Northrup is the goat: for accepting a too-good-to-be-true invitation or for playing music for his captors.
Nothrups .homecoming is equally onerous: after the shock of his return, there is not even a hint of family suffering because of Northrups absence.  It is as if African American fathers don't really matter, they can drift in and out of the family like ornaments since it is the women who really run things, continued evisceration of the African American male, painted in harmless colors.
The book 12 Years A Slave was written in an environment of subservient fear of retribution that was harsh and far reaching.  For its day, it was ground breaking.  To present it today, as a movie, without an explanatory context of the efforts of so many African Americans and others in the struggle for freedom and justice, is demeaning and damaging.  Any black that stands up for 12 YAS is either blind to truth or convinced of the general all-inclusive inferiority ascribed to those kidnapped Africans who were enslaved.
12 Years A Slave is a student film with a high budget and credible actors.  In my opinion, it is:  heavy handed; unresolved, poorly paced, and lacking in the depth of understanding and perception, indicative of quality, professional American cinema.  The storyin the form it was presentedwould have been better served as a silent film, complete with subtitles and accompanied by an organ, in keeping with its claim of being true to the book, which was written for a 19th Century audience without the vantage point of 21st Century sophistication.",1393718400,33,5994,4.96003996003996

6060775,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"Director Steve McQueen (no relation to the actor) has made a name for his personal, bold themes (Shame) and has come of age with his latest, most affecting film, 12 Years a Slave, adapted by John Ridley from the novel by Solomon Northrop.  Perhaps no major studio film has portrayed slavery in America so honestly and directly.

Solomon Northrop (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a free man in New York in 1841 with a wife and two children.  He is educated and blessed with a talent for playing the violin.  A tempting offer of work leads him to Washington D.C. where two white men trick him into being mistaken for a slave.  Helpless and unable to communicate with his family or anyone who can help him, Solomon is pulled into the world of torture and servitude as a slave to be auctioned as a commodity in the South.  Northrop is witness to inhumanity by white slave owners as families are torn apart.  He is sold from one plantation to another and finds one owner, Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender, a standout), who is not only strong willed but cruel and immoral.  Time goes by, and he always maintains a sense of dignity and hope while exhibiting compassion for his brethren.  Northrops desperate attempts to escape or get a letter to his family need the sympathetic ear of a good Samaritan for his salvation.

Imagine being held against your will and performing menial, backbreaking work at the behest of cruel masters who strike out with deadly violence at the drop of a hat.  Now imagine that as an educated slave, he dares not reveal his intelligence lest he be executed.  Silence means survival.  Rebellion is met with severe punishment and death.  All this goes on year after year with little or no hope.

That it took this long in cinema history to depict this stain of human intolerance is sobering especially in the post-Roots generation.  McQueen depicts the horrors of oppression and outright sadism while getting the details such as the frightened reactions of slaves to mere sounds.  He also has a firm sense of time and place with striking visuals.  Cinematography is excellent, and the period recreation is authentically convincing with historic set design and costumes as well as the flavor of music.  The film is similar to the lean narrative of Clint Eastwoods recent films without the emotional pathos of Steven Spielberg.

Ejiofor (Salt) has the best role of his career, and aside from the always impressive Fassbender (Prometheus), the surprise performance has to be Lupita Nyongo as perhaps the most tragic of slaves.  Benedict Cumberbatch (perhaps the busiest actor currently) has an effective role of a sympathetic slave owner.  In an interesting bit role, Saturday Night Lives Taran Killam shows a brief glimpse of dramatic potential.  There are several name actors who take supporting or bit roles including Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano, and Alfre Woodard.  Brad Pitt has a brief but significant moment that is a turning point in the story.  He had a significant role as producer in bringing the book to the screen, and it shows just how shrewd he was to take a chance on a story that needed to be told.

Its a very sobering journey in American history that is harrowing and painful, and by the time the powerful ending arrives, you may find yourself not only thoroughly drained, but more appreciative of the life of one person (whose postscript is also noteworthy).  Its a difficult subject matter handled by McQueen with compassion and unflinching realism.  A moving chronicle of a family torn apart amid historical injustice, 12 Years a Slave is about the indomitable human spirit and its ultimate triumph amid intolerable adversity.",1393545600,,3649,4.86084142394822
6060776,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"I first heard of Solomon Northup about 17 years ago when I read excerpts from his memoir, 12 YEARS A SLAVE, in an American literature class in college. I vaguely remember being appalled by some of what Northup and his companions were forced to endure and I was even more upset by the realization that Northups trials and tribulations were typical and tame by some standards at the time. I don't like admitting it, but until the movie 12 YEARS A SLAVE was released, I hadnt thought anything about Solomon Northup since that college class.

Solomon Northup was a free-black who lived in Saratoga Springs, New York. He was a talented violinist who supported himself doing various labor jobs during the dry periods of music playing. In 1841 while his wife and children were away working for a wealthy family, Northup was tricked and kidnapped by two traveling con-men slave traders and sold into slavery in Washington, D.C. He was chained, beaten, and broken and given the new name of Platt. He was eventually sold to slaveholders in Louisiana and for 12 years lived as a slave until his true identity was eventually revealed and he was rescued from his plight.

12 YEARS A SLAVE is a magnificent piece of cinema. The acting is superb, particular the performances of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon and Lupita Nyongo as Patsey. The cinematography is beautiful and the direction of the film well executed. The vivid brutality and violence are contrasted with images of the lush and beautiful natural scenery of the South. The contrast is stark and augments the power of the story told on the screen.

The movie provides a real and raw look at the horrors of slavery in the United States. Living in the world we do, its easy to forget or not even realize how brutal and horrific slavery was. However, it was probably the darkest blight that ever existed upon the collective conscious of the countrys moral fiber. As Samuel Bass (Brad Pitt) says, Theres a sin, a fearful sin, resting on this nation, that will not go unpunished forever. There will be a reckoning yetyes, Epps, theres a day coming that will burn as an oven. It may be sooner or it may be later, but its a coming as sure as the Lord is just. That sin was slavery and 12 YEARS A SLAVE is a vivid example at just how horrible a sin it was.

12 YEARS A SLAVE is a powerful film. I am thankful for having seen it because it kindled forgotten memories from snippets of a story I read many years ago. After seeing the movie, I did some more research and am now more acquainted with Solomon Northup and his terrible journey. Besides being just a superb piece of filmmaking, 12 YEARS A SLAVE has the potential to cause many others to become acquainted with Northup and, perhaps more importantly, be reminded at just how horrible slavery really was.",1393545600,,2794,4.604417670682731

It is amazing in its ability to bring you into the era.  You are brought into this film in a visceral way.  12 Years a Slave isn't a ""curl up with the family flick"" but a film that every American should be aware of.

The main characters journey is amazing, the actor that played Solomon did a great job; the other actors as well.

6060791,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"I have to admit that I was a little disappointed after all the buzz.  I've seen a lot of powerful films about slavery (Amistad, Roots, Glory) and this movie fits into that group, but I don't think it's the best of the bunch.  Maybe it's a generational thing and this generation hasn't seen those earlier films. Too bad, b/c they're amazing, and a tough act to follow.  To me, 12 Years as a Slave had great acting, but it tended to drag, there were long closeups of faces but I wasn't sure why, and the dialog seemed ""quaint"" at times.  (Maybe it was trying to stay close to the original manuscript, but the language often seemed unnaturally formal.)  I'm happy that Nyong'o got the Best Supporting Actress award, and I guess it was time, after all, for a serious movie about slavery and the African-American experience to win Best Picture.

6060792,2,B00G4Q3KOC,The movie itself was okay being that it is based around actual events but in my opinion the acting could have been a little better.  The production needed more stars whose acting skills could have really conveyed the true emotion behind the story line.  The story went some what fast as well not allowing the viewers to understand who the main character was before the tragic  events took place. I would not recommend this movie to anyone and I feel that it was a waste of money.  This movie does not do the main character any justice being that it was sad what happened to him and his family.,1393459200,2,593,4.412844036697248

6060820,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"I am a big fan of Steve McQueen's movies,and 12 Years a Slave did not disappoint. It's a gritty and visceral tale of a free man who is kidnapped and then enslaved on Southern plantations. I won't bother summarizing, as others have done it already, but I thought the acting was excellent -- one of my favorite (and very Steve McQueen) moments was an extended shot of Solomon just staring around himself while thunder rumbled ominously in the background, and you couldn't help but ache for this man who lived in terror every day -- it was moments like that, thoughtful, unhurried moments, that made this movie so very moving. Chiwetel Ejiofor's transformation from an educated man to the quivering persona he had to maintain to survive was striking.
Steve McQueen has an amazing talent for hearing the space between the notes, so to speak. This is not a fast-paced film with clear-cut good guys and bad guys. We see Solomon, our protagonist, refuse to end one woman's misery as well as whip her; and we see a cruel slave owner treating a little slave girl like his own daughter. All the twisted, convoluted aspects of humanity are spread out on the screen, and the horror and obscenity of slavery casts a pall over every aspect of life.
I would have liked to have known more about Solomon's life before he was kidnapped - was he always free? Was he born to freed slaves? He seemed to have so much respect in the East - was it that way for all blacks? I wish we'd gotten a little more of his backstory; that's my only criticism of the film. All in all, an outstanding movie, and I hope it cleans up at the Oscars this year!",1393286400,,1620,4.476351351351352
6060821,3,B00G4Q3KOC,"I was somewhat disturbed by the concentration on the main character, the freedman who was captured. He had a horrible thing happen to him, but his virtual non-involvement with help other slaves seemed narcissitic to me. He didn't even care about those that had helped him when he was able to go home. The end of the movie struck many people I know as inconclusive. Was one of those women is wife....was she remarried. Or was the gentleman holding the baby the son-in -law?  the movie showed the intense passion and hatred of the southern slave owners quite well, but the story itself was not written in an intelligent, clearly spoken manner. Some very important things were not clear. Why would someone with his position go to Washington on a whim to play the guitar. I don't know,  It was an OK film. I am sorry that I spent fifteen dollars to see it. I learned nothing more about the historical time in this Nation's History, in which I am well studied. Much worse happened to slaves than was portrayed.  Poorly written based on the book.  Sharon W. Kidd, LMFT",1393286400,,1062,4.573684210526316

Beyond all the political backlash the movie has gotten ( sensitive topic in America) there is so much here to see.

I wasn't sure what to expect going into this film considering that films over the past 10 years have often not been what they once were. But this movie is not just great, it's a revelation. Director Steve McQueen has created a tense, spellbinding masterwork in the tradition of what makes cinema truly great. And to add to that it is not only a very important and beautifully told story about the evils that was once slavery in America, but it is also a very realistic testament to what African american's were forced to endure in a very dark time in this nation's history. The film is often very bleak and brutal, but also drives home in a very powerful way just how terrible the injustice of slavery truly was and is.

Rarely have I seen such a subject treated so realistically and so honestly. This is a must see, and easily not only the best movie of the year but probably the best film of the decade. It's unflinching, honest, heart breaking and powerful. I have no doubt what so ever that it will walk away with the best picture of the year Oscar. If it doesn't it would truly be a damned shame.

All of us in this country have been impacted by it: it underscores much that we do or do not do, much that we say or do no say, much that we feel or believe we ought to feel. It is the blight that infects us all, though it also, as the film shows, and as James Baldwin and other writers manifest, can be the tale of resilience, human ingenuity, and love. !2 Years a Slave begins the process of showing slavery's horrors--you see the beatings, the misanthropy,  the day in and day out psychological warfare against African American people. It is difficult to watch, but slavery,  like the Holocaust, was horrific. We who live in slavery's shadow must see our past for what it is, for if we don't, we will continue to be mired in our present stasis: whites wondering why blacks are so angry; blacks wondering why whites are so naive. !2 Years a Salve is a beginning, a first step towards confronting the horror of slavery.

Solomon Northup was one of very surviving victims of the fugitive slave laws. He was lucky, but he was also smart, as were many others who weren't fortunate enough to have achieved his level of education. But there's nothing obvious about these characters, black or white. The plantation owners were all playing their part as businessmen. Some had an easier time swallowing the inhumanity of slavery, made profitable use of it, and justified it for the sake of their Christian souls. Others settlled their consciousness by adapting a paternalistic attitude. They cared for their slaves and made life livable. Most harrowing is the story of Patsy, favored and even loved by her sociopathic owner. His absolute belief that slaves were inhuman pet-like objects of ownership, combined with his emasculating wife and her jealousy of Patsy put this beautiful, creative young girl on the chopping block.

It's one thing to hear about it as a school history lesson but it's quite another thing to see it layed out raw and bleeding in a film like this.

 There is not a drop of gloss to this story. It's brutal and in your face uncomfortable. It feels like the suffering will never end and I felt hopeless numerous times throughout the film. 12 years of brutality is a long time but the film doesn't just show Solomon's story. You feel acute pain for the slaves around him because they do not have the hope of rescue that Solomon carries in his heart. For them this life of sorrow was all they knew. It's unimaginable and yet the film makes it all so real. You entirely forget you are watching a film. You are watching pure evil for what was and is.

I feel different after watching 12 years a slave. Slavery will never look the same to me again. I will think of the mother's whose babies were ripped from their arms. I will never forget patsy with that sad small piece of soap in her strong trembling hands and so many other harrowing images from this important film. I did not want to see them but I needed to.

6060876,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"Last week I reviewed the book 12 Years A Slave. This weekend I saw the movie adaptation of the book, also titled 12 Years A Slave. Unless you live under a rock, Im sure youve heard of the movie and that its been nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Chiwetel Ejiofor for Best Actor, Michael Fassbender for Best Supporting Actor, Lupita Nyongo for Best Supporting Actress and Steve McQueen for Best Director.

I found the movie to be a great adaptation of the book. Some things were condensed or not explained in as much detail as they were in the book but the overall sense of the dreadful life of a slave was still there. The story is told in a non-linear fashion with flashbacks to Solomons life before he was kidnapped into slavery. The one thing that really bothered me was the opening scene in which Solomon is having sex with another slave. I don't think its a spoiler to say that in the book, Solomon is faithful to his wife during his entire time in slavery. Im not really sure what the purpose of the sex scene was supposed to be. If you have an idea of why it was included, please tell me!

The movie is produced by Brad Pitts production company, Plan B. I found it funny that Brad Pitt cast himself as the one truly good guy in the South, even though its a very small role. His character is originally from Canada but had a southern accent. Did Canadians speak with the accent they have now  aboot for about and the like  back in the 1800s? I would have liked him to speak that way. Ejiofor, who plays Solomon was phenomenal. At times, the camera would just stay on a silent close-up of his face for several seconds and his agony was palpable. Thats a testament to McQeens great directing as well.

Fassbender was really good, but theres no way hell beat Jared Leto of Dallas Buyers Club for Best Supporting Actor. Nyongo was fabulous and she had some of the hardest, most emotional scenes of the movie. I think she deserves to win Best Supporting Actress for sure.

This was a hard but wonderful movie. I think that if you read the book first, youll have a more in depth understanding of events but even without having read the book, I think youll find the movie fantastic.",1392595200,4,2209,4.428571428571429
6060877,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"I loved ""Shame"" and also his tremendously strong follow-up. I saw it twice in theaters. And while it is not easy fare to watch, it totally captivates from the opening scene of a free black person making a successful life for himself before falling for two slick con men to the grueling slave scenes with another winning performance by Michael Fassbender as a slave owner who falls in love with one of his slaves, Lopita Nucero, in another award winning performance. The acting is superb. The Adapted Screenplay is brought to a very believable life in a rare true story of a firsthand account of slavery by someone who experienced it.
The Art Direction is also great as the southern mansion owned by Michael Fassbender goes from its glory days to a crumbling edifice.
The acting casting is superb as both Alfre Woodward and Paul Dano along with Brad Pitt all give strong supporting performances.
Steve McQueen will hopefully be the first director, who happens to be black, should very well take home an Oscar. Already sitting with a Golden Globe, Mr. McQueen directs with as adept a hand as Steven Spielberg handled ""Schindler's List"".
I am a rare breed who has seen ""Schindler's List"" over 20xs and ""12 Years a Slave"" has the exact same possibilities.

Besides the mini-series ""Roots"", there really hasn't been a raw and accurate portrayal of the time-period. That was, of course, before ""12 Years a Slave"" came along.

The new gritty film from Steve McQueen chronicles the true story of Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free black man from upstate New York who was abducted and sold into slavery. We follow his struggle to stay alive, facing cruelty from multiple slave owners. His harrowing journey is difficult to watch, and certainly isn't for the faint of heart. Despite the raw nature of the movie, there is a touching true story to be seen.

Chiwetel Ejiofor has already nabbed a Best Actor nomination for The Oscars, and totally deserves it. There are also some fantastic supporting roles played by Brad Pitt, Michael Fassbender, Paul Giamatti, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Paul Dano.

Solomon Northup as portrayed by Chiwetel Ejiofor comes off a bit wooden and milquetoast. His angst ridden countenance stays the same for 90% of the film. The full spectrum of human emotion is largely absent from Chiwetel's mannerisms.

There are 2 actors that shine through: Michael Fassbender and Paul Dano. Both convey the prime evil of white bigot slave owners. The director Steve McQueen seems to love working with Fassbender as he is in all 3 of McQueen's movies.

The worst part of 12 Years a Slave is the under-utilization of Brad Pitt. The previews made it look like Pitt plays a starring role, yet his screen time doesn't break the 5-minute mark.

6060883,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"This is one of, if not the best, serious human drama movie of the year in my opinion- simply because the story is based upon the book by Solomon Northup, which was released in 1853-this gives the story it's personal value, and it was intense. I repeat: intense.

It is easy to identify with fictional characters when the story is true-to-life and well acted, but it is entirely another thing to view a movie like this and feel as though you have been transported in time, and are privileged to witness the bravery and courage  of both Blacks and Whites during a dangerous time in our own American history, especially when you know the actual person existed and the details of Solomon's experience were true. The power of the movie lies not only in the story and the acting,but is is also expertyl directed.

American history is part of what has made this nation what it is, and every flaw and blemish that once stood against us as a nation, has added to the strength of this country as a nation; but history is not just dry facts, recounted as though there was no impact upon human lives-history was created by humans and American history was not a peaceful thing-it flowed with the blood of many, and the lives of these individuals, as wells as  the decisions they made, impacted laws and legal rights today; all of which lead back to stories like Solomon Northup's Twelve Years a Slave.

There were many 'bad guys' and 'good guys' in this account-plenty of conflict and betrayal, just is in real life; but-

6060885,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"Take care when purchasing.

This is a re-make of the 1984 ""Twelve Years a Slave Solomon Northup's Odyssey"". The numerous 1* reviews are from viewers who mistakenly bought the original version, thereby distorting the ratings.

Though he claims to be essentially a happy person, Steve McQueen gravitates towards unsettling emotive subjects, directing with sensitivity and insight. He focuses on fallibility - both of the system and of humanity. Michael Fassbender has featured in all 3 of his full length movies to date - they make a great team.

Under McQueen's superb direction in ""Hunger"" (2008), Fassbender plays IRA activist Bobby Sands' highly publicized hunger strike in the Maze prison in 1981. His next project, ""Shame"" (2011) shows Fassbender as a 30-something sex addict whose life spirals out of control. ""12 Years a Slave"" is loosely based on the true story (written by Solomon Northup in 1853) of a free black man from New York abducted and sold into slavery in the South. Here, Fassbender is the unhinged cotton plantation owner, Epps. He has a meaty role, but this time it is Ejiofor's movie.

Given McQueen's choices of subject matter, it is little wonder that one feels completely wrung out after watching any of his movies. The McQueen/Fassbender combination is flawless and it is also no suprise that McQueen's movies have all won numerous awards, as have his lead actors.

There have been many books, movies and TV series on the subject of slavery in America. The 1977 TV series ""Roots"" and Spielberg's 1997 movie ""Amistad"" stand out together with ""12 Years a Slave"" in visually depicting different aspects of this brutal, misguided practice.

The imagery, cinematography, set design, musical score and acting in ""12 Years"" is faultless. Chiwetel Ejiofor truly owns the role of Solomon/Platt, as do Fassbender as Epps and newcomer Lupita Nyong'o as Patsey.

Fassbender (Irish/German), and Ejiofor (British) never let their accents slip. (McQueen is British too). With the exception of Bryan Batt as Judge Turner and Brad Pitt's wooden cameo as the pivotal Bass, fine performances all round. (Did Pitt, as co-producer just need to show his face, without putting some effort into it?)

But nothing is perfect, including this movie. There were a couple of scenes that just didn't gel. On the boat, a slaver stabs an abductee when he tries to intervene in the rape of a woman, a radical departure of Northup's account of the voyage. Much is made of the value of slaves as property, so this murder would not have been without serious consequences, or probably would not have happened at all.

In another scene, a fallen white overseer arrives at the plantation to join the pickers for paid labour. After a brief conversation with Solomon explaining his situation, Solomon decides to trust him with a matter that could have dire consequences if exposed (no spoilers). Solomon, an intelligent, educated man, would never have done that.

To really nit-pick, the frame of the half constructed gazebo is much larger than the finished product.

At times, the movie wallowed - editors please? There has been criticism that Northup's freedom and the post-slavery prosecution of his abductors/owners only featured in the closing credits.  However, the title ""12 Years a Slave"" defines the story as Northup's ordeal only, with a brief introduction and an even briefer conclusion. Even if the book had more, I am OK with screenwriter John Ridley's interpretation of this biopic.

I believe it can be forgiven for deviating somewhat from the book and for being slightly inaccurate or far-fetched at times.  It is a quality film, fully deserving of praise - but watch it with a Kleenex or two at hand.",1391644800,2,3702,5.037643207855973
6060886,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"My elders were slaves in Nazi Germany and Stalin's Russia and from them I heard how slaves were treated. While watching this movie, I was struck about how different was black slavery. The blacks in America had value as to the owners they were worth much. They were expected to be simple idiots.  It was interesting to see this.

Having said this the film is a rather fascinating picture of a free man enslaved. His struggle just to survive on a plantation. I particularly liked the scene were a slave, a mother loses her children and is expected to forget it after dinner.

What I did not like in the movie was the continually attack on religion in the movie. Religious people on the debate of slavery in the US existed on both sides.

The acting considering so many good actors were in the movie, I did not think was so good. Probably the best was Lupita Nyong'o as Patsey. Her story was fascinating.

6060887,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"Most young people as students in grade school learn about slavery in America through somewhat clinical means as students reading history books. As time goes on, young people, if their middle school or high school doesn't go into greater detail as they grow older, they tend to forget or push to the back of their minds possibly the most heinous crime against humanity that this country has ever perpetrated. And when something comes along that does detail that era, it's shocking to discover. I'm hoping that when school teachers look to teach their older students about slavery, that director Steve McQueen's 12 YEARS A SLAVE is the film that they go to in order to illustrate what it was like in that era.

The film follows the trials, hopes, defeats and victory of Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Eijofor, in a career-making performance), a free black man living happily and somewhat successfully with his wife and children in Saratoga, New York in the early 1840's. He is a man of great intelligence, kindness and talent, and it is this talent that two con artists exploit in order to kidnap Northup and send him south to Louisiana to be sold as a slave. Despite his protestations that he is indeed a free man, he learns quickly that the white people that have sold him into bondage care very little for that. He becomes the property of a decent-enough man named Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), who appreciates that Solomon (now referred to as Platt) is more educated than he leads on to be, but due to a life-threatening scuffle between Solomon and one of Ford's underlings (Paul Dano), he is sold off to the brutal slave-owner Epps (Michael Fassbender) and his equally vicious wife (Sarah Paulson) where he spends the rest of his days as a slave, and forms a bond with Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o), another slave who is favored over all others by Epps because of his continued sexual abuse of her. Also met is Bass (Brad Pitt), a Canadian handyman who believes that slavery is a sin on America that will be visited upon the country's landscape in the future.

This is a film unlike any other film I've seen about slavery because it doesn't shy away from the more brutal and terrifying moments that were prevalent in this time. Director McQueen does a marvelous job of showing the film almost entirely from Solomon's point of view. Since this film is indeed based on Northup's own memoirs, it would be deceitful to show alternating points of view. This is a world entirely seen through Northup's eyes, and writer John Ridley (THREE KINGS, U-TURN) adapts this as authentically as possible. There are many quiet moments where McQueen drops the excellent Hans Zimmer soundtrack to just ambient noise and lets the audience into moments that are reflective and horrific. As per usual with McQueen's films (like HUNGER and SHAME), his direction is artfully sparse. He avoids the traditional trappings to make an epic of this film and doesn't over-flourish the film with sweeping dramatic camera movements, but uses long single-takes to immerse you in this world, and in this man's life.

The acting by all is superb, particularly by Eijofor, who has slowly been making a name for himself as a great supporting actor in films like SERENITY, SALT, KINKY BOOTS, and CHILDREN OF MEN. But this film truly gives him the opportunity to shine brightly, and it's a performance that is difficult to be topped this year. Similarly, newcomer Nyong'o crafts a performance that is often harrowing to watch and shows no ounce of fear in her performance. Fassbender (the star of McQueen's two previous films) is almost a human personification of the devil with his piercing eyes, outwardly handsome appearance, but his performance, while very strong, doesn't lend much to his character other than an eternally threatening presence since the film is told from Solomon's perspective, which again was the wisest way to go. Other performers like Cumberbatch, Paulson, Alfre Woodard, Paul Giamatti, and Garret Dillahunt aren't much more than cameos in some cases, but still leave a lasting impression.

I know that other reviewers might be trying to downplay the importance of this film by stating that making a film about the evils of slavery is ""old hat"" or should be left in the past, because according to some of these people, a film like this only exists to make white people feel guilty. The irony of that attitude is not lost on my opening statement. I don't think that McQueen set out to make a film solely to make white people feel guilty about things that happened quite some time ago. I think that he made a film about an extraordinary man that overcame cruelty, degradation and despair to come out and make the country and indeed the world aware of what was happening and how it was . While I don't think that this film has the creative resonance of Alfonso Cuaron's GRAVITY or Spike Jonze's HER, 12 YEARS A SLAVE is an excellent and very important film that should be shown to successive generations so that this sin is not something that is repeated, and that, albeit in other countries or in other ways, this sin still exists to this day.",1391299200,3,5117,4.798185941043084

6060890,3,B00G4Q3KOC,"2013 British-American film adaptation of the 1853 memoir 12 Years a Slave, Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor, Dirty Pretty Things), a New York State-born free negro who was kidnapped in Washington, D.C. in 1841 and sold into slavery. He worked on plantations in Louisiana for twelve years before his release.

The movie seems to want to realistically depict the United States' greatest failing: the horrors of centuries of slavery as accurately as Alex Haley's ROOTS had in the 1970s. The movie starkly displayed the sights and sounds of enslavement - from slaves picking cotton as they sang in the fields, to the crack of the lash on a person's back.

But some liberties with the realism may have been taken. Shortly after Northup is kidnapped, when on a ship bound south, a sailor who has entered the hold is about to rape a slave woman when a male slave intervenes. The sailor stabs and kills him which is unlikely - slaves were valuable, and the sailor is not the owner. The scene is not in the book.

The ideology behind enslavement is clearly present. Masters such as William Ford (portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch) and Edwin Epps, both use an interpretation of Christianity to justify their ownership of slaves. They believed the Bible sanctioned slavery, and that it was their `Christian duty' to preach the scriptures to their slaves.

Of slave-master William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), who in the memoir Northup said, ""There never was a more kind, noble, candid, Christian man than William Ford,"" adding that Ford's circumstances ""blinded [Ford] to the inherent wrong at the bottom of the system of Slavery."" But even under the best conditions, the movie never loses sight of Northup's being property, which his well-being and life are at the whim of his owners.

The movie's power and flaws lies in the unsettling details and psychological contortions slavery inflicts on everyone involved, black and white. The film shows Ford as not wanting to have to be placed in a position of having to challenge the justness of slavery. Circumstances force his ownership to be transformed to a brutal master (Michael Fassbender). Each scene here shows how psychotic life in the pre-Civil War era would appear to the modern mind.

Any northerner who's visited the south knows that a southerner recognizes a northern accent. Why doesn't anyone ever recognize Solomon's? In fact, when he's first abducted, someone proclaims how southern he is. In slavery time: an educated, free Negro did not speak distinctly different from an uneducated slave? Wouldn't everyone always tell Solomon rather than him having to proclaim, you must know I'm different?

Although portraying an admirable character, Brad Pitt's line delivery is as wooden as the structure he builds. No one was in charge of continuity? How huge the wooden frame was [the size of a 2-story house] yet the finished gazebo is so small.

Sarah Paulson is so perfect as the jealous mistress of plantation that only contempt can be felt for her. Character actor Paul Giamatti is so at home portraying a slave-trader that it felt as though it was a repeat performance for him.

Alfre Woodard appeared to have fun portraying a slave who's gained a position of comfort as a mistress. Is it realistic to believe that Pasty (Lupita Nyong'o) and Solomon would not resent and loathe her haughty entitlement as her life appears stark contrast to their degradation?

Thomas Jefferson wrote that all negroes (being negro) smelled bad; would any people who were denied to bathe regularly be able to smell their own ""bad"" smell? Patsy is to be believable demanding the right not to ""gag"" at her own bad smell but not demand to be treated with common decency? She wouldn't have asked Alfre how she got her white man to treat her with some form of dignity? She wouldn't have stopped picking ""twice as much cotton as any man"" on the plantation every time the master or his wife abused her? She wouldn't have used her dolls to curse the master and his wife?

The movie spent so many scenes showing horrors of slavery that its rushed ending robbed it of a great ending. Rather than merely writing it on the screen, many scenes could have been shortened &/or deleted to actually show the courtroom scenes depicting Solomon challenging the humanity, intelligence and fundamental decency of slavery. How many films have (not) ever depicted court scenes of Blacks vs slavery?",1391040000,11,4409,4.936572199730095
6060891,2,B00G4Q3KOC,"The movie was beautifully shot and features good performances but suffers from a bad script. The book it is based on, Twelve Years a Slave by Solomon Northup, published in 1855, is a beautifully written, moving account of the horrors experienced by a free black man from New York who was imprisoned and made a slave to work on plantations in the deep South. The events in the book would have made a fine movie but they were not sufficiently brutal and were changed, with unfortunate results. For example, Solomon Northup said in his book that during the voyage from Norfolk to New Orleans, shortly after his kidnapping, he and his friend Robert planned to take over the ship, but their plan was ruined when Robert fell ill with small pox and died four days later. In the movie, Robert gave a white man a dirty look and was stabbed to death. That was a bad change from the book since, among other things, it was implausible. These slaves were valuable property, some fetching $1,000 at auction. That was a small fortune in those days and you would make every effort to keep a slave alive and well, not just kill one of them on a whim. There are many other ridiculous events in the movie reflecting the attempt to make an already horrific story into something even more monstrous, and backfiring in the attempt.

Hollywood took this masterpiece of a book and turned it into a ridiculous cartoon featuring live actors. The movie is depressing to begin with but how it screwed up an excellent story is just sad.",1390867200,33,1507,4.5814814814814815
6060892,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"12 YEARS A SLAVE doesn't pull its punches as far as the depiction of the sufferings of slavery is concerned.  There are several harrowing sequences showing the ways in which the white masters exert their authority, especially at Edwin Epps' (Michael Fassbender's) plantation, where slaves and whites look on as Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) is whipped for little or no reason.  In Steve McQueen's film, there is no such thing as a 'good' master: although Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) understands Solomon's (Chiwetel Ejofor's) suffering, he feels unable to intervene; as a slave, Solomon is part of a debt that Ford has had to pass on to Epps.  The one 'good' white, Bass (Brad Pitt) is not an American, but a Canadian immigrant and therefore 'untainted' by the whites' creed during the antebellum era.  The film is not without its questionable elements: one wonders whether a slave would be forced to whip a fellow-slave (most slave-owners had white overseers to undertake that task); and the issue of Solomon's release is perfunctorily handled (Bass delivers a letter which lleads to Solomon's release from servitude, despite Epps' justifiable objections.  Surely Epps, as the legal owner of Solomon/Platt, would have been able to challenge the decision in court.  Nonetheless, it is a vivid dramatization of Northup's 1853 autobiography, reminding us that, even in the post-civil rights era, there are still people doomed to a life of penury with little hope of redress.",1390694400,3,1465,5.186440677966102

6060899,1,B00G4Q3KOC,"When this movie came out in the theaters, my first thought was ""this is gonna win the best movie oscar"". Not because it's that good, but simply for political reasons.
Victimizing blacks is ""in"" today, because America is full of white racists (right, that explains why we have a black president twice in a row).
With constantly victimizing blacks we are not doing them a favor though. We are just putting another boot on their throats telling them they cannot achieve anything without us.

Sure enough 12 Years a slave is up for several academy awards (which in my opinion mean nothing anymore since the mid 90s), and I am sure it is going to walk away with most of them.

The story about a free black man who is enslaved is tragic, no doubt. But after Django unchained and The Butler, 12 Years a slave has a completely different purpose entirely: instigating a race war seems to be our current president's agenda and Hollywood obediently complies. These movies serve but one purpose: whites should feel guilty, blacks should seek ""revenge"" (although no black American living today was ever a slave and the slavers have been dead for a very long time now). The man who before his first election claimed he would unite America is indeed doing exactly the opposite.

Slavery was not an American problem, not a Southern problem. It was (and still IS in many moslem countries, where slavery still is LEGAL to this day) a world wide problem. So far every other country has gotten over it. Now it is time for America to do the same and not use slavery as an excuse for crimes committed by blacks.

The real losers in America still are the native Americans and we don't feel compelled to throw a pity party for them nowadays anymore (one could almost assume that slavery is so much worse than genocide).

The problem I have with 12 YEARS A SLAVE is not so much the theme itself, but rather the way it was staged and directed. The South consists of white racists only (when in fact only a MINORITY owned slaves), the white masters are not just villains, but monsters, and the only descent white person isn't American, but Canadian (Pitt's character), because God forbid, we cannot have any ""good"" white AMERICANS. This movie serves but one single goal, to incite hatred towards whites. The way it was directed, makes this very apparent. A better director would have made a difference here.

""NO LIVING PEOPLE, BLACK OR WHITE, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT OTHER BLACK AND WHITE PEOPLE DID GENERATIONS AGO.""

GET OVER IT!

As I stated before, this review takes a deeper look at the movie's intent and political background.
A (BLACK!) man, Booker T. Washington (1865-1915), a man born into slavery did not let slavery and black victimhood stand in the way of attaining respectable positions as an educator, author, orator and an advisor to presidents of the United States.

Booker T. Washington warned of certain people within the black in his 1911 book MY LARGER EDUCATION, describing them as ""problem profiteers"":

QUOTE

""There is another class of coloured people who make a business of keeping the troubles, the wrongs and the hardships of the (Black) race before the public. Having learned that they are able to make a living out of their troubles, they have grown into the settled habit of advertising their wrongs - partly because they want sympathy and partly because it pays. Some of these people do not want the (Black) to lose his grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs."" (p. 118)

UNQUOTE

 America still has a racist problem with many black racists coming out of the woodwork, claiming false victimhood - just as Washington said happened back is the early 1900s - supported by guilt-ridden white supporters. Any decent black man or woman contradicting them is accused as being an ""Uncle Tom"" while white people speaking out against them are being labeled ""racist"".

12 YEARS A SLAVE plays right into these peoples' hands. It serves a number of purposes, namely, inciting hatred against whites, victimizing blacks today (""post-slave-disorder""), serving as a justification to commit crimes and most importantly, serving as a justification why blacks are entitled to special treatment and handout (reparations). If 12 YEARS A SLAVE had just been for educational purposes, it would have had to been staged a different way.

America needs more blacks like Booker T. Washington. The black community is strong, it does not need to rely on black hardships of the past. There are a lot of black people who have accomplished a lot on their own, without constantly whining about slavery. But instead of honoring these people, blacks choose to continuously cripple themselves with the help of white liberals continously telling them that they are poor in incapable, while they keep them down in the ditch. THAT is TRUE racism.",1390176000,62,4828,4.833939393939394
6060900,3,B00G4Q3KOC,"Theres a poignant whipping scene near the end that involves a bar of white soap, but the best moments of this real-life Slave story come after the screen fades to black. Its a beautiful Hans Zimmer orchestral score based on the movies main character, Solomon Northup. That it sounds almost identical to Inceptions Time theme, also composed by Hans, is, artistically, a major blunder. But listening to it is more enjoyable than watching the movie. Thats not a moral criticism. Watching a dramatization of an essentially innocent man, or woman, endure the hardships of slavery generally doesnt bother me. Its just that, plot-wise, Solomons story, based on his 1853 memoir, doesnt necessarily make for an interesting movie.

The acting was very good and the protagonist played by Chiwetel Ejiofor is exceptional in all matters concerned. The film lapses around the time where a decent man is kidnapped and sent to be a slave. It seems most African-Americans in those days were treated as slave. It is shocking to watch how their owners considered them their property and it was a done deal by everyone involved. I don't quite understand how this originated and the film doesn't talk of that but it simply begins with a good man's life going going to the worse most pitiable circumstances.

A very intentional play by the director is that at no time he really blames race or even instigates such an institution of thought. He simply shows all sides to a possible story and asks not for justice but for the prevalence of common sense surrounding the very morals of freedom of a human being and the need for there to be equality in freedom.

There are many powerful scenes. I was quite moved but somewhere I felt this film could have had more scenes involving a general biographical outline of sorts towards the beginning. It just puts you into the shoes of the day. While for some people, this lack of any PRIOR DESCRIPTION was very effective.

Yet the strong point is that the film is entirely focussed on one individual's despair. Again, some great acting by Fassbender (not my ideal pick for the role but still) , Brad Pitt (small cameo) and Chiewetel along with Lupita N.

Overall a worthy watch but it may not haunt you like the director's other films have. Case in point, you ask? ""Shame"" (2011)",1389657600,12,1657,4.645051194539249

I'm not a big fan of watching or learning of slavery. The brutality suffered during these times of our American history makes me uneasy, and although everything in the film is essentially fake, it's uncomfortable to watch since it's not entirely fiction and things like this happened during the 1800's.

I decided to watch this film because I wanted to know the ending. The little background I did know about the movie is that a man was free, enslaved, and eventually free again. With the savagery that was going on in the south during the time period, I was intrigued that someone was able to get away from it. All too often you these kinds of stories have a predictable ending.

The main actor, Chiwetel Ejiofor, is extraordinary in this film and in my opinion he was robbed of the Golden Globe for best dramatic actor. Not to take anything away from Matthew McConaughey for his win for Dallas Buyers Club since I haven't see it personally, but this was one of the best acting performances in the past decade. Of course I will not watch Dallas Buyers Club to compare the actors' performances and decide which one is better. Everyone's opinion is subjective, so take that with a grain of salt.

I don't want to get into too much of the plot and possibly ruin the movie for anyone. If you have any interest in this movie at all please watch it.

The film's completely speculative opening is the beginning of what seems the film's almost total interest in jarring the viewer. The main character, as written, is a rather one-dimensional representation of a man whose ever-present thought was any occasion to see and touch his family again. The film's main character seems lethargic in his compliance with the institution by comparison. The film's story never really connect to this man, his family life or that of other characters. It feels detached from the source material, and more obsessed with shock, when both things could have co-existed in balance and made the film even more powerful. Time that could have been useful in conveying the truth depth of the real Solomon Northup is wasted on long laborious expositions of a given brutality.

As a descendent of American slaves, yes, I think it's important for people to see the true degradation and horrors of that institution.

Human history isn't pretty - and this movie makes no attempt to convey otherwise. In fact, there were a few extremely horrific and dramatic events that Solomon experienced that he recounts in his memoir that I'm surprised were left out of the movie, given that they would have made for some utterly intense scenes.

As some reviewers have mentioned, there were a few moments where one or two of the actors were slightly-less-than-believable, but in no way did I find it distracting from the story - especially when you couple your viewing experience with the book (also available on Amazon).

Whether you ever read Solomon's memoir of the same name or not, I feel that the creators absolutely did Solomon justice. This heart-wrenching story will make you cringe out of fear and anger as you witness what feels like pure evil, and weep from the bittersweet conclusion.

After having watched the film, I was glued to my seat in shock, with tears streaming down my face and a fierce gratitude burning in my chest the likes of which I have rarely--if ever--experienced.

I went home and quickly journaled:

I will not forget it. I am a free man, and I am overcome with how privileged I am to be alive in this point of time.""

6060907,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"12 years a slave is a true story about a man named Solomon Northup.  He was a free black man in the North who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the South.  This movie is based on the book he wrote back in 1853 under the same title.  The movie has caused a reemergence of sales for the book, which, until recently, had been forgotten.  The movie flows fairly well and is definitely a must watch film if you are interested in topics such as African American history and slavery in America.

Be warned that the film has some graphic scenes of violence.  These include whipping scenes where whipping someone causes the flesh to be severed from their back and there are scenes of lynchings as well.  Obviously, they are necessary scenes to show the brutality of slavery at that time in history.  They are sprinkled throughout the film and can easily be forwarded if you decide to buy the DVD.

The story moves by quickly after the first 15 minutes of the film.  It does not drag at all.  The film is about two hours and fifteen minutes long, but you will not know it.  The story is told in a very linear fashion and is easy to follow.  My only problem with the film was, during a lynching scene, a heavy metal guitar rift is the chosen music for the scene.  I thought for the period, it seemed out of place.  Obviously, it is no reason to take a star off for just that.

I think the film is very important to serve as a counterbalance to films such as Birth of a Nation and Gone with the Wind.  Those films show slaves being content as slaves, while films such as 12 Years a Slave show the brutality of slavery as well as the hardships faced by the slaves.  It is always good to have more than one side telling the story.

In terms of the graphic portrayals of slavery, I would have to rate this film as fairly tame compared to movies which discussed the topic of slavery back in the 70's.  Drum, Mandingo, Mandinga, and, of course, Goodbye Uncle Tom were way more graphic.  In fact, I would go as far as to say that they are very difficult films to watch.  What those films do not offer is the fact that 12 Years a Slave is told by an actual person who lived through the difficult ordeal.

6060908,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"12 Years a Slave is possibly the most brutal movie about slavery I've ever seen. It's unflinching in its portrayal of the inhumanity involved in selling slaves and the attitude of them being nothing more than just, basically, livestock. This is summed up no better than a line delivered by Mistress Ford to a female slave just separated from her children, ""You'll forget about your children soon enough,"" as if she was a dog being separated from her pups. Of course, Eliza did not forget about her children.

However, as brutal as the film is, it is very much detached from the emotion of the things that are happening in most circumstances. You see the horror, but you don't really feel it. In that, it's almost like watching a documentary. It's more clinical than visceral, a drawback for a movie like this, and I'm not sure what causes the disconnect. It's not a lack in the quality of the acting.

Chiwetel Ejiofor does a great job of bewilderment after he's kidnapped at the beginning of the movie. He make us believe in the unreality of his situation. At least, it's unreal from his perspective. Solomon Northup was, after all, born a free man and the idea that he's been taken into slavery is a bit beyond his conception. The problem, I think, with the movie overall is that Ejiofor never really seems to believe in the situation he's in. It's as if every moment he's waiting to wake up, and that may have been what made me feel removed from the action of the movie. I'm not sure that's all of it, but I know that's some of it.

Michael Fassbender, on the other hand, is completely ""within"" his character, Edwin Epps. Fassbender is not someone I've thought much of as an actor thus far. Not that I've thought he was bad, he's just been someone I've mostly shrugged off as, ""eh, what's the big deal?"" But he did a great job as Epps. He was completely believable as cruel and erratic. And Sarah Paulson, who played his wife, was wonderful(ly horrible) as his cold, bitter wife.

Many of the other actors were also quite good in their smaller roles. Giamatti, Cumberbatch, and Pitt were more than adequate, but their roles didn't require anything more of them than to be the kind of characters they frequently are. Pitt, in particular, seems to have chosen hos role specifically (he did produce it) to deliver the message he wanted to deliver, and he fit well in that part. Paul Dano was also quite good. Actually, Dano is good enough that I always have a hard time remembering who he is when I see him on screen. He seems to gravitate toward parts that are kind of slimy, but he fits so well into them, that he mostly disappears.

The most unsatisfactory part of the movie, though (and this is kind of spoilery, but, if you have any grasp of racial history in the United States, it shouldn't be anything unexpected or surprising), is the bad guys go unpunished. Of course, this is because the bad guys went unpunished, so it's more that it's an unsatisfactory part of history; no fault of the movie. It does, however, stir up feelings over the injustice of how Northup was treated. That's actually a positive aspect of the movie, because you should feel that Northup was treated unjustly. He was treated unjustly.

It was a good movie but not one that I felt was great. There's almost no way it won't get a best picture nomination, but I don't think it's going to win. I don't think it ought to win. From a movie standpoint, it was just missing... something. Something ineffable, I guess. That doesn't make it a movie you shouldn't see, though. Evidently, the message that all men should be treated equally is still a message that needs to be delivered.",1388361600,6,3658,4.560121765601218

6060910,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"Theres a moment towards the end of 12 Years a Slave where Solomon (Chiwetel Ejiofor) looks directly into the camera and seemingly at the audience.  He stares for an extended moment, as if to say, Can you believe that only 150 years ago  this happenedin the United States of America?  12 Years a Slave is the quintessential American slavery-era film; it is heartbreaking, disturbing, tender, raw, and also beautiful.

Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Solomon Northrup, a free, New York citizen who is a victim of a horrific kidnapping scheme where Southern slave traders abduct free Black citizens and transport them South forcing them back into slavery.  Northups life and family are ripped from him so suddenly that it is astonishing.  The title is pragmatically evocative of how long Northrup will endure his injustice, and director Steve McQueen makes sure the audience feels every bit of it as well.

The film is based on Northrups own memoir, a literary example preciously rare as so many slaves died before they could tell their stories or were never taught to read and write.  A pervasive struggle Northrup faces in the film is searching for tools or opportunities to write.  The film opens with Northrup covertly trying to make ink out of blackberry juice and fashion a pen out of stray twigs.  McQueen wisely emphasizes the oppressive silencing that occurred in order to, in some way, try to explain how such outrageousness was even possible for so long.

McQueen frames Northrups experience by casting recognizable faces as various archetypes of 19th Century Southern society.  Paul Giamatti plays a slave merchant in all of its absurdity, Benedict Cumberbatch plays the hypocritical plantation owner who seemingly appreciates humanity but wants to turn his eyes from the horror he knows is happening right under his nose, and Brad Pitt playsJesus; Im pretty sure hes playing Jesus.  However, one player, other than Ejiofor, gets to sink his teeth into a role that is far more substantial, Michael Fassbender.  Fassbender plays Edwin Epps, a slave owner who owns Northrup for nearly 10 of his 12 years in slavery.  Fassbender is terrifying; his character is reminiscent of Ralph Fiennes character in Schindlers List, yes  hes that chilling.  However, what sets him apart from being a typical embodiment of evil is that as the film goes on, it is clear that Epps is mentally ill.  This element does not garner sympathy for his actions, but it does reveal some of the helplessness inherent in a society that avoids the value of human life.  The end result is a decaying infrastructure that eats away at itself until it collapses.

Of course, this is a showcase for Chiwetel Ejiofor, an actor who has been on the brink of greatness for some time now.  Ejiofors performance is certainly in the running for the best of the year.  He harnesses strength as he portrays the effects of a dark and obtuse time in human history.  As Solomon Northrup, he leads the audience through a series of events that certainly require a bold and fearless guide.

12 Years a Slave is a moody masterpiece that Im sure offers more context in repeat viewings, but I don't know what kind of person would be able to sit through this film more than once.  McQueen contrasts the most abhorrent events of our young countrys history with some beautiful filmmaking, glorifying the Southern landscapes in rich, luscious irony.  His camera is up close and personal, using countless close-ups with the clear objective of putting slavery in your face.  The emotion is real and raw, not melodramatic.  Towards the end of the film, Northrup finally breaks down, which is inevitable.  He weeps for what he has missed.  It is a history lesson of the best and worst kind.

6060911,4,B00G4Q3KOC,"Black race/slavery movies are tricky business these days. Regarding 2013s entry in the genre, 12 Years a Slave, black author Orville Lloyd Douglas declared in the newspaper The Guardian he wouldnt go see it, explaining, ""Regardless of your race, these films are unlikely to teach you anything you don't already know As a black person, I can honestly say I am exhausted and bored with these kinds of dramatic race films."" Now, you can agree with him or not, but he makes a point  slave movies tend to tell the same kind of story over and over. And over.

British director Steve McQueen is pretty famous in his homeland for making movies about bleak subjects. Now he tries to bring a fresh perspective to that piece of American history that we all love to hate. 12 Years a Slave is based on the true story of Solomon Northrup, a well-educated, wealthy black free man living in New York with his wife and kids. He is kidnapped by slavers and sold to a plantation near New Orleans, and spends the next twelve years trying to make sense of what happened to him and hoping to make it back home.

McQueen really tries to make this more than just your typical slave movie. He spends some time exploring the fact that slavery wasn't really about racism  it was about money. It was (and still is) an economic system that exploits people for profit. In America, most of those people historically had dark skin. Solomon led a happy and comfortable life in New York  he was well-respected. He had money. This point is brought home later in the movie when Solomon meets a white slave picking cotton in the fields with him.

Brad Pitt has a minor role in the movie, and his whole purpose (Besides being the Great White Rescuer) seems to be to explain to Solomon that racism and cruelty don't cause slavery, but is the result of it. Racism developed as a way for people to justify the fact that they were treating people like property. Their consciences needed a way to hide from themselves the horror of what they were doing. So they covered it up with even more horror.

Artistically, this movie is a success. The cinematography is beautiful, it is well-written and well-acted.

Its also hard to sit through. It is long, and there are some very violent parts. Sometimes, for extended moments, all action stops, and you are forced to just sit there and absorb the sounds of whats going on in the scene  insects buzzing in the moss-covered trees, or a woman crying for her lost children, or a man being hung.

12 Years a Slave is artful, beautiful, and focused. It tries to clarify a few stereotypes and myths about this important era of American History. But make no mistake, it is still a slave movie. And if you aren't in the mood to watch two hours of torture and oppression, it will be hard to absorb any other lessons the movie offers.",1387324800,4,2825,4.532416502946955
6060912,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"There have been a number of films and mini-series over the years that deal with the lives of African-American slaves and the history of slavery in America. But what I think 12 Years A Slave brings to the table is how it shows in stark and unblinking terms the role of violence in supporting the institution of slavery.  Other films have of course shown violence in connection with slaves and slavery, but it is usually episodic - it happens and then it is done with.  None have made the connection so firmly as this one, showing that when one is a slave, violence and the threat of violence are ever present, always lurking beneath the surface, requiring only the slightest impulse or excuse to be unleashed on any slave whom the slave owner, overseer, dealer or in fact any member of the slave-owning class deems deserving of it. In this film, you can see why the institution endured as long as it did, why slaves so seldom rebelled and when they did were so quickly put down, and why, in the end, it had to be ended from outside the system with an even greater level of violence in the form of the Civil War.

The film begins in 1841, in Saratoga Springs, New York, where Solomon Northup (Chiwitel Ejiofor in a sure-to-be-Oscar-nominated performance) is a free African-American living with his wife and two children. Solomon works as both a carpenter and as a fiddle player. One day when his wife and children were away on his wife's business, he is introduced to a pair of men (Scoot McNairy and Taran Killam) who work as travelling entertainers and is persuaded to join them on a tour to Washington that they assure him will be quite lucrative.  But once in DC, when their tour is apparently concluded and it's time to settle up, Solomon is tricked into drinking something that soon leaves him insensate and unable to resist.  When he awakes, he finds himself chained to a floor in a strange room, where two strangers enter and inform him that his name is Platt, that he is an escaped slave from Georgia and that he is to be taken to a slave market to be sold.  When he tries to assert the truth of his identity and status as a free man, he is immediately beaten into submission, and beaten again any time he tries to say anything other than the fake identity being forced upon him.

Solomon, along with a few other kidnapped victims that include a mother and her two children, is shipped to New Orleans, where he is sold along with the mother, whose children are kept for separate sale, to Lousiana plantation owner William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch).  Ford turns out to be a relatively benevolent master, and in the hope of getting on his good side so that he might one day try to assert his real identity and status, Solomon assists him by suggesting and ultimately creating a waterway for transporting the plantation's logs swiftly and more efficiently downstream. In gratitude, Ford presents him with a violin, knowing that he can make use of it. However Solomon's efforts backfire on him in that he arouses the jealousy of a white carpenter in Ford's employ, John Tibeats (Paul Dano), who begins abusing him, first verbally and then physically, which pushes Solomon beyond the point of fear and results in his assaulting Tibeats and beating him with his own whip.  From there, things quickly go downhill and Ford, fearing for Solomon's safety, does what he thinks is the only way out and sells Solomon to another plantation owner named Epps (Michael Fassbender in a compelling chewing-the-scenery performance), warning Solomon that Epps is a harsh taskmaster but refusing to hear when Solomon desperately tries to tell him the truth of his identity, claiming that he has a debt to pay. From that point on Solomon's life goes straight to a hell that endures for eleven of the worst years one can imagine.

A hard film to watch in places, but nonetheless a highly recommended one for anyone interested in what it meant both to be a slave and to be black during the slavery era.",1387065600,10,3986,4.6331444759206795
6060913,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"There are a few great films that make all other movies, no matter how wonderful, seem frivolous by comparison. Steve McQueen's ""12 Years a Slave"" is one of those. The true story of Solomon Northup, a free black man in upstate New York in 1841 who was kidnapped and sold into slavery, the film shows the total horror and degradation of living as a slave, as well as the total corruption of slave traders and masters.

Chiwetel Ejiofor is quietly, burningly powerful as Northup, a man torn from his happy family life to face years of torture and brutalization. You could call his experience a Hitchcockian nightmare, except that the phrase trivializes the absolute horror of his situation. Yet as hideous as Northup's situation is, it is relatively comfortable compared with the fate of Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o), a woman enslaved by plantation owners Edwin and Martha Epps (Michael Fassbender, Sarah Paulson). The epitome of crazed corruption, Edwin likes to pretend that Patsy is his mistress by choice, and Martha likes to pretend that Patsey is her rival. Both are too twisted to recognize the truth: that Patsey is a helpless pawn driven to the brink of suicide by the unspeakable sadism of her master and mistress.

The very title gives away that Northup's servitude comes to an end. Yet even when it does, there is no feeling of closure; he lost 12 years of his life for no reason, and Patsey and the other slaves live on in agony. ""12 Years a Slave"" is a movie that lingers powerfully in the memory, and stands as a rebuke to films that made the plantation system look benign (""Gone with the Wind"") or turned it into an action-revenge-movie joke (""Django Unchained"").

I was so, so disappointed in 12 Years a Slave. I have always rooted for director Steve McQueen for taking on important issues, but every pitfall that possibly awaited him in making this film, he succeeded in stepping into. Self-important, self-righteous, steeped in modern-day race politics (a lot has happened between now and when slavery occurred, making the film a strange experience and giving it an untruthful ring); and, devolving in the end into a politically correct feel-good fest, it perhaps apes its projenitor in Schindler's List a little TOO closely. For a truer representation of the subject matter, see McQueen's own Hunger, which although avoiding the race-baiting and the American slavery history, succeeds in being a clarion for universal human rights.

Let's hope that Mcqueen runs and doesn't walk to the nearest exit away from Brad Pitt and his production company.",1386288000,23,1052,5.005714285714285
6060915,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"12 Years a Slave is by far the best movie Ive seen in a number of years. The movie is based on the autobiography of Solomon Northrup, a free man kidnapped and sold into slavery during the early 1800s. While the subject of slavery is a difficult one for Americans, this movie shines a spotlight on the effects of slavery on both the perpetrators and the victims. While much has been said about the physical violence depicted in the film (which by the way is definitely toned done from what happened in real life), I found the emotional and psychological impact having the greater effect on me personally.  Perhaps because I had read so much about the graphic depiction of the films violence, I was better prepared to watch it unfold on screen.  However, what I wasn't really prepared for was the emotional impact of the film. Chiwetel Ejiofor eloquently conveys the main characters emotional and psychological journey from free man to slave. His expressions and eyes make you feel the characters despair and emotional struggle with what is happening to him.

Its sad to see similarities between Solomon Northrups era and our own.  The notion that an individual must always be in possession of his free papers demonstrating that he is a free person of color is eerily similar to current show me your paper laws meant to prove citizenship.  It reminds me of the quote those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it. The messages and paradoxes presented in the film leave you thinking; for example, the use of religion by the slave masters to justify enslaving human beings and the slaves reliance upon religion to help them cope and get through their enslavement. The move is so thought provoking.  It makes you wonder about the hypocrisy of those who try to revise history and pretend the Civil War wasn't fought to end slavery.  It also makes you understand why African Americans are insulted when told to get over it and slavery ended a long time ago. While slavery officially ended in 1865 with the passage of the 13th Amendment; slavery by another name (Jim Crow, segregation) endured until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1965.

The acting, directing, cinematography and story-telling are excellent.  As others have stated, it is definitely a must see movie.  All of the actors give award winning performances and the film is just beautifully shot and visually pleasing. Dont be afraid of watching such a well told film on American history. I encourage everyone to see this move.

6060916,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"To be fair, the only reason I chose not to headline this as the best movie of 2013, is because I have not yet seen American Hustle, The Wolf Of Wall Street, Saving Mr. Banks, and I think even Out of The Furnace may get some attention. But today is a day I will remember for quite awhile. Here is my review for the movie 12 Years A Slave.

This movie introduces us to the historical figure Solomon Northup (played very memorably by Chiwetel Ejiofor). He is a well known player of the violin, and he is soon happened upon by two men who convince Solomon to join a circus to perform. Unfortunately, things go from bad to worse quickly and soon after, Solomon is a slave.

12 Years A Slave does so many things right that you almost forget that it is a movie. Michael Fassbender has really outdone himself with this movie. His character Edwin Epps, is the definition of sadistic evil. Michael Fassbender acted the role so well, I had to remind myself several times he's just acting. It is sad to see how his character tries to justify his harsh treatment of ""his property"" with the bible, but thankful for the characters like Benedict Cumberbatch's(yes he is in this movie) character Mr. Ford that sees that these people are humans just like the rest of them.

How great the story is would be a summary of how I feel about the movie which is one word: Miraculous. I can go on and on about how great the actors/actresses are in the movie, but the story and direction are just as great. And with that being said, I agree with every positive review that has been said on Amazon(and in general) about the movie 12 Years A slave. Because without a shadow of any doubt, 12 Years A Slave, be it that it is a heart breaking, depressing re-telling of slavery in America, succeeds as film of hardship and courage. The Oscar race has just gotten tougher and I would not be at all surprised to see this movie win multiple awards including Best Picture of the year. Yes, 12 Years A Slave is a great movie, and yes you should definitely see it.

6060917,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"First, thank you Steve McQueen, John Ridley and Brad Pitt for directing, producing and creating the screen play for the novel ""12 Years a Slave"".

Second, anyone who wants to know how utterly brutal most slavery was in the United States need only READ first-hand accounts of it which can be easily found in a local library, by doing a simple google search, or by viewing a thoughtful, accurate, and moving rendition of one of those `first-hand accounts'.  My opinion?  That perfect, brought to the big screen, first-hand account is ""12 Years a Slave"".

Hands down, this is the best piece of work I have ever seen on American Slavery and, in my humble opinion, it tops the mini-series ""Roots"" which for many years has been the quintessential media authority on slavery in this country.  Yes, ""Roots"" spanned several generations and was pretty epic, but between the acting and how the story was told in ""12 Years A Slave"" it tops any other artsy or dramatic film that I've seen about being a slave in the American South.

A note of caution:  this isn't ""Driving Miss Daisy"" or ""The Help"" - lol.  Though these last two movies mentioned discuss a period of America many decades after slavery ended, the point I'm trying to make by mentioning them is that ""12 Years a Slave"" isn't sugar-coated to be sweet, sappy or give you that warm, melodramatic, non-threatening feeling.  It is the truth and the truth can be a very hard and bitter pill to swallow.  I knew this movie would be difficult to watch, but I had no idea how difficult.  I wept throughout.

The acting was superb by the entire cast and I hope there will be some Oscars received by the film, because it is deserved.

There aren't enough stars in the sky to rate it.

P.S.  After writing my review of ""12 Years a Slave"" on Amazon.com, I went back and started reading others' reviews and noticed that an excellent summation of this movie by another mentioned the film ""Schindler's List"" in his title as did I.  That should convey just how deep, visceral and important ""12 Years a Slave"" is.  No more ""oh slavery wasn't that bad,"" please.  It really was that bad.

The crimes that occurred to the women slaves were a necessary part of the movie understanding why more so from the book.  I watched and learned how truly horrible slavery was and feel my American History schooling did me no justice. In the book Solomon told of not being able to empathize since not being a slave yourself which ultimately changed.  I cant imagine living free with a wife and kids being ripped away from them for 12 years of torture.  This book/movie should be required reading or seeing for high school upper classmen.

He is tricked into being kidnapped, and then is chained, beaten, broken down, re-named (now called ""Platt""), transported and sold into slavery in Louisiana. Northrup is one of the very few people to have escaped this terrible plight and, eventually, return to his home and family.

This story is primarily about those 12 years a slave from the book Northup later wrote detailing the transition from free man to slave, the shocking living conditions and treatment of slaves in the south, and his own ordeal in the hands of three slave owners within a system of institutionalized captivity and abuse. His account provides a rare and incredible historic insight. The film is gritty, raw, real and details exactly how slavery ""worked"" in this country, including the many lines of defense to prevent escape, the extreme measures to deny freedoms, the ways slaves survived and did not, and the ill effects on  the people committing or allowing such atrocities.

Torture and violence are set against an often beautiful scenic background, a physical example of the many contrasts presented in this film. The characters are complex and many insights into that time in history are revealed as well as eternal truths about human nature, cruelty and kindness, survival and courage. In this beautifully shot, masterfully crafted film, the main actor Chiwetel Ejiofor makes you desperately feel each and every emotion Solomon experiences from a carefree stroll with his wife and children in New York all the way through his horrific ordeal until his reunion with his family 12 years later.

6060921,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"I watched ""12 Years a Slave"" tonight, or should I say cried through most of it. A brutally painful, difficult film to watch, at the same time impossible to turn away from. As much as I have ever known about the atrocity of slavery in this country, nothing really prepared me for the intensity of this film. It is incomprehensible to me, hard to wrap my mind around, the fact that in this country, these things actually happened, that slavery festered like an abscess for so long as part of the history of this country, and that the vestiges of the ""peculiar institution"" continue to linger to this day, poisoning the hearts and souls of so many Americans who have the audacity to try to apologize and defend and minimize the profound impact it had on so many lives, and continues to have. To describe the film as emotionally powerful is to not do it justice. Steve McQueen is a brilliant director, unflinching as a storyteller, who has succeeded in eliciting from his actors some of the most powerful performances I've seen on film. McQueen makes frequent use of very long screen shots, holding the camera on the subject far longer than one would expect, often to purposely draw the viewer into the agonizing brutality of a scene, but just as often to focus on the raw emotion of a human face who has lived through unspeakable things no one should every have had to live through. The result is at once absorbing and intensely discomforting. McQueen spares us nothing in his portrayal of the barbarously cruel and complete affront to human dignity that was slavery, nor should he, nor should anyone....a film this raw and honest in its portrayal of one of the darkest volumes of our history as a nation, was a long time coming; far too long, I think.

By the beginning of the Civil War, four million men, women and children suffered in bondage. The word ""Suffered"" is used deliberately because white Americans, no matter how sensitive, do not have a full grasp on just how brutal, inhuman and sheer evil, slavery in America was.

""12 Years a Slave"", (Steve McQueen director) based on the true story of Solomon Northup, is a big step in redressing this omission as it shows the daily cruelties of life on a slave plantation in 1840's Louisiana. Northup lived as a free man with a family in Saratoga, NY when he was conned into a trip to Washington D.C. (where slavery was legal) and sold down into the Deep South. The story is essentially one of a proud man retaining his dignity and his sanity against inconceivable odds. The acting is impeccable with special notice going to Chiwetel Ejiofor as Northup, Michael Fassbender as his insanely complex master, Epps; and newcomer Lupita Nyong'o as Eppss mistress, Patsey, whose suffering is even more tragic than Northup's

""12 Years a Slave"" is no ""Roots"". Despite the poster image, there are no dramatic escape scenes with baying hounds and hideouts in the bayous. Solomon does not escape; he endures. And what makes his tale so horrific is how casual is the brutality; the floggings and rapes on one extreme, the ugly racist ditties sung by the overseers to serenade those working in the fields on the other. All proceed as normally as any daily routine.

Nowadays, it is difficult to conceive that once in our history, half the population of the United States justified slavery as a beneficial institution, defended by Scripture, good for the booming economy and a boon to the slaves themselves. Even today, if you visit some of the ""Plantation Museums"" below the Mason-Dixon Line, you will find postcards in the gift shop depicting well-dressed and smiling African-American slaves. What you won't see there but will find in this remarkable film are the viciously scarred backs of the whipped, the screaming agony of mothers being ripped from their children; the slumped shoulders of servile submission.

This is a hard movie to watch. It is also a necessity if only to understand why African-Americans might occasionally cast a jaundiced eye on their white neighbors. We've either forgotten, glossed over and denied their history. They haven't.",1384473600,18,2588,4.983796296296297

If there is one parallel between Director Steve McQueen's powerful adaptation of Solomon Northrup's 1853 memoir, '12 Years a Slave', and Spielberg's 'Schindler's List', it's that both are told from the perspective of survivors. Both are exceptions to the rule: in Schindler's list, the 1500 or so Jews who were saved by a German businessmen, of course do not represent the fate of their 6 million co-religionists who were exterminated by the Nazis; and similarly, Northrup was only a handful of kidnapped freedmen turned slaves, who was heard from again. In a sense, the survivor's tale mitigates the horrors somewhat. While the survivor does not represent what happened to the majority, at least the audience can identify with the exceptional rescue --in this way, we can all feel that there's at least some hope, despite all the surrounding darkness.

Having read some excerpts from the book the film is based on, it appears that this is a very thorough, truthful adaptation of Solomon Northurp's original account. Director Steve McQueen already established himself as a master of the visual medium in his disappointing, fictional effort, 'Shame', but here, dealing with a compelling true story, McQueen is finally able to shine.

The film begins with Northrup already in captivity and we soon flashback to his almost idyllic existence as family man/musician in 1841 Saratoga, New York. The inciting incident of course is his kidnapping after he's conned and drugged by men who misrepresent themselves as businessmen who are in need of a musician to play a limited engagement in Washington, D.C. The break into the Second Act, which constitutes the beginning of Northrup's nightmare, is when he's sold into slavery down in New Orleans. The scene is doubly horrifying as Northrup witnesses the separation of two children from their mother, who are all sold into slavery.

The first half of Act II features heightening tension as Northrup is sold to a relatively kind plantation owner, William Ford, who treats him decently and even gives him a violin as a present. Ford recognizes that Northrup is educated (without questioning where he got his education) and allows him to assist in engineering a waterway for transporting logs downstream. Nonetheless, the plantation overseer, the brutal racist Tibeats, resents his boss' special treatment of Northrup. Things come to a head when Northrup beats Tibeats up after the arch racist provokes him. Northrup is tied up and almost lynched but is prevented by the head overseer, who tells Tibeats he can't kill Northrup because Ford will lose his original $400 investment. The big revelation is that even though Ford 'owns' Northrup, he is unable to prevent Tibeats from taking revenge and settles on selling Northrup to another plantation owner, the even more brutal Edwin Epps.

Epps is a religious fundamentalist who reads Bible passages to his slaves but also beats them whenever he's in the mood. He's also a hypocrite, as he's sexually infatuated with a young slave, Patsey, who he rapes and will not stop, despite his wife's constant entreaties. The jealous wife takes out all her hatred on poor Patsey too; in one powerful scene, she offers treats to all the slaves, except Patsey, who she strikes in the head in front of her husband, and a horrified Northrup and his fellow slaves.

The dark moment of Act II occurs when Patsey obtains a bar of soap from a neighboring plantation at the time when Epps is looking for her. Epps has her stripped and orders Northrup to whip her. When Northrup doesn't whip Patsey full force, Epps takes over and delivers a horrendous beating.

Northrup's deliverance occurs in Act III when he meets Bass, a carpenter, who's doing a job for Epps and has abolitionist sentiments. Northrup is reluctant to tell Bass his story since earlier he was betrayed by a white worker on the plantation, after he attempts to convince the man to mail a letter for him, to alert his family and friends in New York. Northrup finally decides to trust Bass and things are set in motion, which leads to his freedom. Perhaps the only real weak spot in this gripping saga is the casting of Brad Pitt as Bass. Pitt is one of the producers of the films and obviously he wanted to get in on the action. But we're too familiar with him as Brad Pitt to believe that this is a 19th century benefactor. An unknown actor here, would have added much more to the film's verisimilitude.

Chiwetel Ejiofor is excellent in the role of Northrup as he echoes the original author's restrained dignity. Now with a great story to work with, Steve McQueen, has delivered one of the best depictions of the antebellum South to date. The film is a great antidote to those who still yearn for the phony story of the south as depicted in films such as 'Gone With the World'. I wouldn't be surprised if '12 days a Slave' won the Oscar for both Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Director at this year's upcoming Academy Awards.",1384473600,8,5005,4.873090481786134

8620652,5,B00G4Q3KOC,"An excellent movie. I always enjoy watching movies that have truth to them. Twelve Years A Slave is just such a movie. It is, hands down, one of the best book to movie translations. Solomon Northrop was a free African American living in upstate New York when he was kidnapped against his will into slavery. The movie follows his journey through bondage and later escape. He later wrote an autobiography about his experience but sadly faded into oblivion. Seeing this movie brings to light the different experiences of slavery. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in this period of American History.",1527379200,,605,4.9411764705882355

Great acting all around. You cant help but to wonder how comfortable some of the actors were in their roles, so I applaud them.",1527120000,,304,4.446428571428571
