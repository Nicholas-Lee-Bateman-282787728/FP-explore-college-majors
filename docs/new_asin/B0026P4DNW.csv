3856476,5,B0026P4DNW,"This film of a pair of bald eagles raising their young was both enjoyable and educational. Beautiful images of the birds in their lush rainforest habitat of SE Alaska were accompanied by actual sounds from the wild. One scene of the pair roosting side by side clearly shows the female is significantly larger. The director's commentary added interesting details about the birds and the filming.  A bonus is the footage of black bears, sea lions, and swans that also inhabit this wilderness.",1259452800,4,490,4.975609756097561

There is an abundance of widlife present, for along with the magnificent eagle feeding, courtship and nesting behavior there can be seen black bears, seagulls, seals and ravens, warblers and woodpeckers can be heard in the background.

8353377,2,B0026P4DNW,"I was expecting more i.e. some talking, some history. This is basically a bunch of film clips with a musical background. Not worth buying or watching.",1435017600,,150,4.8076923076923075

8353383,5,B0026P4DNW,"Fascinating footage of an eagle pair raising a young one in the wild.  Seeing the young bird fledge was a site I'd love to see in person, but I appreciate Peter's patience in capturing it on film for me.  Peter should do some work in HD video.",1260835200,,243,4.148936170212766
8353384,5,B0026P4DNW,Breathtaking photography especially close-ups of the eaglets in the nest. Just about every minute of this DVD could have been a framed still shot. Nicely paced and informative narrative. I can see an eagle's nest as I write and would give this DVD as a gift to my neighbors who share the interest in our local eagles.,1259798400,,317,4.578947368421052
