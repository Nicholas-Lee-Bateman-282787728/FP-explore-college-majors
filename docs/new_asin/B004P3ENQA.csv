8437427,5,B004P3ENQA,I got the movie because of her after I saw her act with Yul Brynner. Her comedic timing was great.,1441843200,,98,3.95
8437428,5,B004P3ENQA,"For me, Peter Finch performances always bring to mind ""The Nun's Story,"" where he was a surgeon mentoring Hollywood's most breathtakingly beautiful nun in the Belgian Congo, or the way, way, way ahead of its time ""Network.""  Though it's much lighter fare here, he's equally fine.  The reason I tracked this movie down, however, was Kay Kendall.  Mere months before her hideously premature death, she appeared opposite Yul Brynner in Stanley Donan's criminally under-appreciated ""Once More With Feeling.""  She died before that movie was even released. yet there's no hint of that in her performance, where she couldn't be more attractive or brimming with life.  If you haven't seen ""Once More With Feeling,"" buy that first.  And then, like me, you''ll probably want to have a copy of everything Kay Kendall ever did.",1430611200,3,815,5.090225563909774
8437429,4,B004P3ENQA,"Here's an absolutely delightful British comedy from the 1950s, their Golden Age for such films. Simon & Laura are actors, not terribly happy in their marriage to each other, who are offered what amounts to a proto-reality show on British television. Since they both desperately need both the money & the work, they agree to maintain the public faade of marital bliss the viewers crave -- but as time goes by, it becomes increasingly more difficult. Filled with satiric barbs at TV, commercialism, PR, and romance, it's a pleasure from beginning to end. The two leads are funny & charming, and the addition of a canny child actor wise beyond his years only adds to the story. Highly recommended!",1416096000,,694,4.840336134453781

The sets were amusingly eccentric.
The acting was delightful and the script witty.
A rather unique film in some respects.",1402704000,,167,4.793103448275862
8437431,4,B004P3ENQA,"Enjoyable little marital farce 'Simon and Laura' (UK, 1955) plays out against the backdrop of ubiquitous cultural lens/mirror television (both the industry and the medium) and its reality-warping interrelationship with life.  Nothing terribly prescient here script-wise, but it works just fine as an old-fashioned battle-of-the-sexes romp-- er, frolic-- with a pinch of office politics and 'modern' social commentary thrown in.  Tangentially presages lead Peter Finch's Oscar-winning foray 20 years later into no-holds-barred black satire as 'mad prophet of the airwaves' Howard Beale in the Paddy Chayefsky/Sidney Lumet masterpiece 'Network' (MGM/UA, 1976).  Wonderful performances all around by a roster of top-notch British players. VCI provides a very good quality widescreen print.  No extras.  3 1/2 stars.",1397952000,2,812,6.026086956521739
8437432,4,B004P3ENQA,"This book is typical English.  But if you love Kay Kendall and her unfortunately short career, it is a small gem to be valued.",1315094400,,126,4.25
8437433,5,B004P3ENQA,"Adapted from a stage play by Alan Melville, SIMON AND LAURA (1955) is a delightful British comedy about the Fosters, a renowned British acting couple (think Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh), who are hired by the BBC to do a daily show about their ""blissful"" married life.

The problem is that, in real life, this pair is constantly fighting, throwing vases and other crockery at each other, as they head for divorce court.

They, nevertheless, for financial reasons, agree to do the show and, before long the program is a huge success.  Now, if only the two can avoid ""killing"" each other.

Peter Finch and Kay Kendall are marvelous as the bickering couple, and Ian Carmichael is also hilarious as their somewhat naive producer.  The dialogue is witty and director Muriel Box keeps the action moving at a nice pace.

8437434,4,B004P3ENQA,"J. Arthur Rank Film Distributors and VCI Entertainment presents ""SIMON & LAURA"" (1955) (91 min/Color) -- Starring Peter Finch, Kay Kendall, Muriel Pavlow, Hubert Gregg, Maurice Denham, Ian Carmichael, Ian Carmichael, Richard Wattis, Thora Hird, Terence Longdon, Clive Parritt & Alan Wheatley

Directed by Muriel Box

The sort of unassuming film that makes you smile. Its cynicism is countered by a playful innocence in its construction.  Peter Finch and Kay Kendall great but look for an excellent performance from Muriel Pavlow-a wonderful actress who was much more than one of Mr. Rank's ""English Roses"".

This ""behind the scenes"" story plays off of the ego and self absorbing prevalent in show business. Finch as an actor whose ego constantly needs constant nourishment. Kendall as the jealous wife who must be the center of attention. Both characters are played over the top and the undercurrent of competition, relevant to today's dual career couples, is intense. Denham and Hird steal every scene they can as the success of the show begins to effect their egos.

Very funny and witty film brilliantly directed by the wonderful Muriel Box. Also, a very good historical look at early TV in Britain in the fifties.

A real effort to show how superior cinema was to the new medium?

8437435,4,B004P3ENQA,"The Rank Organization pulled out all the stops for it's 1955 production of SIMON & LAURA, which was filmed in blazing Technicolor and the VistaVision widescreen process.  Peter Finch and Kay Kendall star as a feuding married couple who take roles in a weekly television series.

When the BBC scouts for one of England's ""royal acting couples"" to star in a new daily TV series, the Olivier's prove impossible to hire, so the decision is made to instead cast Simon and Laura Foster (Finch and Kendall), those illustrious stars of stage and screen.  The only problem?  The Fosters' marriage--rocky from the outset--has finally begun to burst at the seams.  They manage to put on a happy united front for the camera (after all, there are untold millions to be made in endorsements and personal appearances), but just how long will Simon and Laura survive in the heated atmosphere of live television?  It all culminates in a special Christmas episode filmed live at the Foster home...

This delightful comedy perfectly satirizes the TV world, with charming performances throughout.  Kay Kendall shines as Laura; this would be one of her final roles in England before moving to Hollywood in the following year (where she made her mark in ""The Reluctant Debutante"" and ""Les Girls"").  Kendall would tragically die from cancer in 1959, on the very cusp of sealing her international fame as first-rate musical comedienne.  Peter Finch channels Lord Olivier with grayed temples and a pencil moustache as Simon, and has a palpable chemistry with Ms Kendall.

What an irony that one of the earliest TV satires would be filmed in colour AND widescreen, but this merely adds to the fun.  Muriel Pavlow, Hubert Gregg, Thora Hird, Maurice Denham, Ian Carmichael and Clive Parritt co-star.",1299024000,8,1771,5.006825938566553
