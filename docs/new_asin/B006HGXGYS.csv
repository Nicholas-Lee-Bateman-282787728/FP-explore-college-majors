8498396,4,B006HGXGYS,"This is a film by Crip leader Terrance Davis who calls himself ""King Greatness"" as those are perhaps the only two words he doesn't mispronounce as he narrates this documentary. Now South Carolina is not LA or Atlanta. In order to make them the most violent etc. it has to use per capita statistics. Davis points out SC is at a crossroads between various areas. He uses mostly existing public news items to explain the history of drugs in SC in relationship to legislation and historical events. He provides some minor insight with his own experiences at a bowling alley. The film also shows gang members doing gang signals for the camera. They don't wear backwards ball caps in SC. We don't have a team.

This is an interesting documentary for those of us who live in this state and I would think would hold some interest for those who don't. The film uses a hip-hop instrumental background repeating the same gansta riff over and over. I don't recall any swearing. 3 1/2 stars",1480723200,,977,4.614942528735632
