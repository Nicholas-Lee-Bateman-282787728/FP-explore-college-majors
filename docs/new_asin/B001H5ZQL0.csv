8307895,1,B001H5ZQL0,This video is flawed. It pixels out and you don't get to see at least 1/3 if not more of it. I have 3 of them and they are all like that. I wonder if the created of the video knows that.  I would have liked to have had at least one good one. So don't waste time or money ordering it.,1481241600,,283,3.564516129032258

8307897,4,B001H5ZQL0,"This a good introduction covering the basics, plus embeds and additives.  The projects are not for making very fancy artistic-looking soap, but for learning the basic techniques and are cute for gift-giving.",1358640000,,207,5.46875
8307898,5,B001H5ZQL0,"I am very pleased with the quality of Sharyn Pak's Soapmaking DVD. Sharyn's clear directions and demonstrations allow one to quick start melt and pour soapmaking and to go beyond a simple start. I was able to make genuine quality soaps that make welcomed hostess gifts, birthday gifts, and holiday gifts. Sharon takes you through a step by step process, and provides caveats, as well to prevent over -enthusiastic beginner mistakes.",1258675200,4,432,5.098591549295775
