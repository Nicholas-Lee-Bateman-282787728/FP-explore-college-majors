8396490,5,B003GNF22E,Great DVD!,1482883200,,10,4.5
8396491,1,B003GNF22E,"You know you are in for a disappointment when the DVD starts with a disclaimer that the music is not played by the Beatles and that ""the Beatles Group"" does not endorse this DVD.  It's a random mismash of presumably public-domain film clips of the Beatles and folks connected with the Beatles.  Much of it is overdubbed with some Beatles-like cover band(s) who sound more like The Ruttles or early Spinal Tap, but without the humor.  My favorite sequence was a minute or more of Paul McCartney being interviewed by a man with a tape recorder while on an airplane, but with no audible voices, just the overdubbed faux Beatles music.  Unless you are a lip reader, that was pretty worthless.",1293926400,4,688,4.661157024793388
8396492,1,B003GNF22E,"I gave it as a gift to my husband,who is a die hard Bettles' fan.  He was very disconcerted with it, and so do I.",1289174400,8,113,3.52
8396493,2,B003GNF22E,"I've seen many, many unauthorised Beatles docs and this is not the worst. I wish I could say more in it's favor but there is not a lot to recommend it.",1278806400,13,151,3.903225806451613
8396494,2,B003GNF22E,"This is probably the worst documentary I've ever seen.  To say that it wasn't worth the ten bucks is an understatement.  I actually fell asleep trying to watch this thing.  I've always been a huge Beatles fan, and I generally buy every video I can find, hoping for something I haven't yet seen, so I own several.  This is by far the worst.  Even the music in the video is not by the Beatles,and the info is just more of the same. Nothing new here.  Do yourself a favor...save your money!",1275955200,22,487,4.2967032967032965
