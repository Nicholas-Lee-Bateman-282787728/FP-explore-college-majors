2789315,5,B000O179H2,This is a great John Wayne movie combo.  Donovan's Reef is not often shown on tv so it was a great addition to the home video library. In Harm's Way is another classic.  Glad I purchased this gift.,1388361600,,197,4.157894736842105
2789316,5,B000O179H2,This is a great movie duo and certainly an asset to my vast collection. Arrived faster than a speeding bullit too!,1359331200,,114,4.476190476190476
2789317,4,B000O179H2,"Not a bad combo, price is right.  Can't remember much about In Harm's Way even having just watched it but Donovan's Reef is a guilty pleasure.  It's got all of John Ford's weird hangups; the woman needing to be cut down to size,  brawling drunken louts as caricatures, non-caucasions both revered as noble savages and branded as idiots...great stuff if one suspends political correctness to enjoy Ford style. Donovan's Reef is by no stretch a great movie but, perversely, it is amusing later day John Ford.

With great color, I'm a big fan of its chummy community where everyone knows each other and the weather is awesome.  The female lead Elizabetth Allen holds her own with John Wayne and an over-the-top Lee Marvin and she stands in well for the Maureen O'Hara role.  Some of the reparteee between the romantic leads is cringe inducing, some of it charming, but that's John Ford.  Really a 3 star movie at best, but a guilty pleasure for its hijinks, location, and likable cast. You'll want to live on that island and spending a couple of hours of movie time there is pure entertainment.",1355184000,,1091,4.7105263157894735
2789318,2,B000O179H2,"The Movies came in good time and I was happy about that. But, Dovovan's Reef was Flawed on the disc itself. About half way through the movie it would blank out and then jump to another scene. In Harm.s Way was really Great!",1332115200,,223,4.209302325581396
2789319,5,B000O179H2,Was finally glad to find this DVD at a price I could afford.  My husband and myself are building a collection of John Wayne DVD's.  We love his acting and how he has some of the same actors on every show - especially Maureen O'Hara! We have watched these so often that we know what they're going to say!,1327622400,,303,4.11864406779661
2789320,5,B000O179H2,"This was two of my favorite of his films. He made many good movies, but I really liked both of these and enjoy seeing them on a regular basis. All the actors are great!",1280707200,,168,3.9705882352941178
2789321,5,B000O179H2,This review is about the DVD. The quality of the DVD is excellent and well worth the money. It should be noted that the aspect ratio is different than what is listed here on Amazon at 1.33:1. In Harm's Way the aspect ratio is 2.35:1 and the aspect ratio for Donovan's Reef is 1.85:1,1230940800,5,282,4.2407407407407405
2789322,5,B000O179H2,"This was actually an anniversary gift for my husband as he had mentioned a few weeks before that he would like to be able to watch ""In Harms Way"" all the way through whenever he wanted to.  When I went to Amazon, they had the combination DVD of ""In Harms Way and Donovan's Reef"" together at a very reasonable price.  Since my husband likes both of these movies (actually anything John Wayne), I purchased the combination and it was the one that had the highest rating.

We've been very pleased with the DVD and my husband has watched it probably 4 or 5 times since it arrived (I might think about sending it back if it keeps up at this rate!).  For anyone who loves John Wayne movies and the story of Pearl Harbor (in a movie - black/white - version) they will enjoy it.  Also ""Donovan's Reef"" is a real kick as there is comedy in it with Lee Marvin and a number of other characters that are truly John Wayne consistent characters.",1220832000,4,931,4.327586206896552

8182602,5,B000O179H2,"""In Harm's Way""

This movie is enjoyable on many levels.

Right off you know it is a John Wayne movie. It is bound to have some John Wayne formula and actors that he works with in other movies. Add to this a cast not just of names, but actors that have a following in their won right. Now you have some great material to work with.

Throw in Director Otto Preminger, who directed ""Laura"" (1944) (see my review) and many other fine films.

Add an intriguing story. It almost seems like two films. The first film being before the war with the relationships surrounding navy life and the Eddingtons (Kirk Douglas, and Barbara Bouchet). The second is after the war gets going with too many subplots to name. However I appreciated the relationship as Captain Rockwell Torrey (John Wayne) rediscovers and builds a relationship with his son, Ensign Jeremiah 'Jere' Torrey (Brandon De Wilde).

You get the entire DVD goodie that make them work while. This includes (Original making-of In Harm's Way)

I do not want to leave you with some idea that this is some sort of artsy movie. It really is a war movie with fast ships going in harm's way.

""Donovan's Reef""

You say it's your birthday

Yes it is a John Wayne movie and has many of his standard cast. This is a Christmas movie and a birthday movie. And, And, And. John Wayne gets to say, ""Swing your legs...limbs over"" in his John Wane manner.

Cesar Romero (Marquis Andre de Lage) is always scheming to go to Hollywood and is the first to bring up the fact that the offspring of Jack Warden (Dr. William Dedham) are half-cast and may not meet Boston standards. This leads to situations that just keep snowballing. ""Oh, what tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.""

Everyone gets an appropriate present for Christmas. But I think the best one is the one that Lee Marvin (Thomas Aloysius 'Boats' Gilhooley) receives. And he gets to play King of America at the pageant.

There is not a slow moment in this film and you have to keep up with all the subplots. And the scenery is breathtaking.",1507507200,3,2160,4.821138211382114
