The DVD offered me the same AMAZING results as the class. When I started I could do the plank for a second, now I am stronger and leaner!",1273104000,2,277,3.711864406779661
8230120,5,B000XW835O,"This is a great workout for all the muscles of the core, from the ribcage down to just above the knees.  Although it's marketed as pre- and post-natal, it's good for women of any age.  I'm 49 years old, and already see and feel visible improvements in my body after only a few weeks of using this workout.",1233532800,3,305,4.241379310344827
