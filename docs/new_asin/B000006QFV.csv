7905007,5,B000006QFV,"This biography of Florenz Ziegfeld is up to A&E's usual high standard of entertaining biographies,and clips featuring footage of the real-life Ziegfeld may give you an awful jolt---he most certainly was not the  debonair,sophisticated figure portrayed by William Powell in ""The  Great Ziegfeld"" (1936) and ""Ziegfeld Follies ""(1946),or by  Walter Pidgeon in ""Funny Girl""(1968)--in fact,the Great Showman  comes across as a rather sleazy gangster-type figure -a more accurate  screen impersonator would have been Edward G.Robinson! This bio,lavishly  illustrated with stills and posters of the era,features a long unseen and  invaluable relic..SOUND FOOTAGE of three members of the 1927 ORIGINAL CAST  of Ziegfeld's greatest triumph-the first production ever of Kern and  Hammerstein's beloved ""Show Boat"",filmed at the time the original  Broadway production was still running. This screen footage,featuring Tess  Gardella,Helen Morgan,and Jules Bledsoe,could only have come from one  source,the once-presumed lost prologue to the 1929 part-talking film  version of ""Show Boat"",and is an invaluable chance to see some  priceless clips. The quality of the video image in these ""Show  Boat"" performance clips is quite bad-be warned-we can't make out  Bledsoe's facial features at all;he is photographed in medium shot,and the  picture looks almost like a badly developed photo. The sound quality for  this sequence is also quite bad,but at least it survives,and is perhaps the  only remaining visual record of any part of the actual original production  (not to be confused with the magnificent 1936 film version of ""Show  Boat"",a beautifully photographed,acted,and sung film,starring Irene  Dunne,Allan Jones,and several members of the Broadway cast of the show.)",933552000,3,1760,5.819607843137255
