8440532,5,B000FSME74,"This is  a great DVD, produced by the folks at the Masters Tournament, that shows all the ends and outs of the 2006 Masters.  There is Arnold Palmer, the Par Three  tournament, Green Jackets, Caddies and four rounds of golf nicely summarized in one hour or so.  Plus there is the Winner's interview and Green Jacket presentation.  To see Tiger Woods hang the Green Jacket on Mickelson is almost worth the price of the whole package.  The views of the Masters that the general viewers do not get on Master's TV coverage is great too.  The Golfers arriving in the dark is just great.",1170720000,3,581,4.528846153846154
