5581591,5,B00BDSJNLU,Have used this workout for a long while and it is awesome.  My old CD was pretty worn out (7 Years) and knew I needed to get another.  Waited awhile since calling the company and they said I had to buy the whole kit again.  Figured since I only needed a few things I checked on a few sites and found exactly what I wanted at Amazon.  The price was right and the CD's are perfect.  Arrived quickly and packaged perfectly.,1416355200,16,420,4.135802469135802
5581592,3,B00BDSJNLU,"The upper body DVD was good but the Advanced Breathing, not so great.  I have had Greer's DVDs before.  The Advanced Breathing just doesn't feel like its doing any real tightening of muscles.",1364256000,3,191,4.757575757575758

8566737,5,B00BDSJNLU,"Wow!  If you want a workout without jumping around doing aerobics then this is an alternative.  I am firming up my arms very quickly.  This type of exercise is not for everyone though.  I would ask my doctor if I was uncertain.  For me though, it is really firming up areas including my abdominal area.  I do all 3 CD's twice a day. I am not so much losing pounds, however, I am losing inches.  I have lost 5.6 pounds in 2 weeks.  It's a start.  Have been a fan of hers for years.  She uses the breathing on 2 of the 3 CD's.  It also comes with a tape measure.  This is a super bargain.",1487030400,5,586,3.956896551724138
8566738,5,B00BDSJNLU,"Yes, it works",1484006400,,13,3.6666666666666665
8566739,5,B00BDSJNLU,"Here's what's on each disk:
Diametric Basics 7 Minute Starter - isometric exercises with normal breathing (did not see Bodyflex breathing on this one)
Abdonda Basics 7 Minute Workout - she explains and demonstrates Bodyflex breathing, then does a 7 minute routine with Bodyflex breathing plus isometric exercises.
Advanced Abs - Bodyflex breathing plus isometric exercises while lying down in bed
It also comes with an Audio CD (Quick Success) and two booklets (one to chart progress and one with ""[diet] secrets to being thin and shapely"").

Like others, I did Bodyflex in the 90s. It did really help to get toned up. I would get compliments on how radiant I looked when I did it. It's a lot of work and I didn't keep it up. Now I think it's better to do two or three breathing moves a day than to not do any. I also believe it helps a lot with ""alkalizing"" or balancing pH. I'm starting it up again. I bought this kit to see if she had changed anything. There are new exercises in it. The breathing is the same as the original Bodyflex breathing. One change is that in the Abdonda Basics 7 minute workout, you do the Bodyflex breathing and then hold the position for another 15-20 seconds before you start the next round.

Hope that helps someone. I really wanted to know what was included in this kit and couldn't find a good description. I think it's very worth this low price.",1473897600,26,1381,4.52
8566740,5,B00BDSJNLU,I love these tapes.  Work great!  Will take a while to master all the exercises.,1472947200,,80,4.266666666666667
8566741,3,B00BDSJNLU,i was hoping it would be like her old vhs i have with just deep breathing etc.,1453680000,,78,3.6470588235294117

8566744,5,B00BDSJNLU,"Poor Greer. She gets persecuted by people who just do not ""get"" it. Laugh, if you will. Scoff and scorn, if you must. Accuse her of being a study  in plastic surgery. That will be because you have joined the group that doesn't ""get"" it.

Her programs have all worked for many, many people because they are based on sound science. Does spending hours in a gym per day sound more reasonable than using the principle that oxygen burns fat, or does doing hundreds of repetitions of belly crunches sound more logical? Where does nature teach us that that makes more scientific sense and is more in line with how the body is designed to function?

If you really want to understand it, then read her book. Or find other information that is readily available out there on the positive effects of aerobic breathing on weight loss and detoxification and on the body in general. Or - you can believe all the hype perpetuated by money-hungry vultures who ignore the science and want to sign us up for endless months of gym payments.

And let's not talk about the FDA and FTC and how they are looking out for our best interests. Are cigarettes and tobacco still legally sold in this country? Enough said.",1438128000,27,1191,4.5514018691588785
