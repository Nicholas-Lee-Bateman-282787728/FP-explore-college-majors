7947859,4,B00005NVWS,"""Families of Israel"" would make a great educational video for young children to see how children of other cultures live.  Narrated by a young American boy (maybe 8 years old), the video is simplistic, yet engaging for children.  It contains two case studies -- one of a family on a kibbutz (Kibbutz Lotan) and the other a family in Jerusalem.  It focuses on mainly on schooling and meals.  For example, how kibbutzniks have communal facilities and take turns in doing chores; the end of year celebration at primary school; and Shabbat (Sabbath) meals.

I would have liked to have seen more about Israeli life in general, and especially more religious aspects, but even so, it's still informative.

The only downside to this video is that the video is very short (27 minutes), but I guess it's long enough for young children to stay focused.",1095638400,,840,4.798611111111111
