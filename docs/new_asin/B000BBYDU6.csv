2411413,4,B000BBYDU6,This show was from my childhood so of course it's a little old fashioned but it's still fun to watch and educational. One of the best PBS style shows and kids nowadays should definitely know these books. I would recommend that everyone watches at least a few of these.,1360454400,,268,4.489795918367347

My favorite part of the show was probably the beginning song & animation, though for this collection it's been changed.  But the substance of the show is still pretty good quality.  Highly recommend.",1360195200,,276,4.829787234042553
2411415,4,B000BBYDU6,"I have just downloaded this Reading Rainbow video. This is now my second. I use to watch this as a child, and now that I have children, I want them to experience this show also. Everything was just as I remember, except the begining title song. I don't understand why they had to modernize this. I wanted the original title song with the original episode. Beside that, each episode is wonderful, and eventually I will collect all of them. Only because of the title song, did I give this 4 stars. If it had the original song, I would have given it 5 stars.",1357603200,,555,4.346153846153846

Sure it was way out of date, but it was still good to listen to the stories.  Nostalgic really, it reminded me of when I was a kid and we literally had 3 channels to watch.  Every Saturday morning I would get up really early and watch TV.  It was the only day they had cartoons on.  After school during the week till 4 they would have educational programming like this.  So sharing this experience with my daughter was really nice.  I love that you can always find what you are looking for on Amazon Prime.

The story was an excellent choice to prepare children (as much as you possibly can) to deal with the expected loss of a loved one.  Then going to the children and having them introduce their projects and tell others of their losses of people they loved lets you know that everyone experiences that kind of loss and that it's normal to think about our loved ones after they're gone.,1434412800,4,541,4.56701030927835

The parrot says, ""Who is it?""  The answer is with a very heavy New York accent, ""It's the plumber."" Unfortunately I don't remember the rest. I'll have to watch the episodes to see how it ends.
I am so happy I contributed to the Kickstarter campaign to keep the show going. Today I received notice that it was successful and there will be more to entertain and teach our children. Thank you, LaVar Burton.",1404259200,,631,4.258333333333334

2412072,5,B000BBYDU6,"This is by far one of the best children's programs to date in my opinion, because it not only teaches children about the world like many other children's shows, but it actively encourages the continued exploration of the topics presented. One of education's biggest life lessons is learning how to find information and then use it. Lemar Burton brings the joy of learning through a medium that seems to be placed in the passenger's seat in today's world.

My only  complaint is not about the show, its about the description written about the second episode on Dinosaurs. Paleontologist dig up Dinosaur bones, NOT archaeologists. Archaeologists deal strictly with artifacts which is anything manmade or in some cases human bones. Please fix your description Amazon. As an archaeologist, I constantly have to explain the difference. It would be helpful if things were described correctly. :)",1401580800,,600,5.112244897959184

Not only is it an excellent children's program that encourages a life-long love of reading with inspiring stories like that of a boy who started a library in his hometown and became a librarian at the age of 13, and fun as well as education field trips, but it's very progressive for its time.

2412178,5,B000BBYDU6,"I loved Reading Rainbow as a child and was thrilled to discover it for free on Amazon Prime Instant Videos. Although the music is a little dated at times, the educational content is sound and the format of field-trip and topic-related book really works. I think it's particularly helpful that the book is read onscreen to the children: it encourages reading and the actors chosen to do the voicework are professionals. My 4 year old likes it and asks for it! I am glad to have something to offer him that doesn't talk down to him, portrays interesting adults behaving themselves, and yet addresses him at his level. A lifesaver at the end of the day when I need 30 minutes to make dinner uninterrupted! Interested parents of my generation (30 something) should also check out the entire Fred Rogers ""Mr. Rogers Neighborhood"" on Amazon Prime.",1389139200,4,841,4.767123287671233

I'm guessing this is one of his first films ever made.  This reminds me that, TV used to be a GOOD thing, not just the propaganda machine it is today, or IDIOT box.  I really like it, Reading Rainbow, and it's message to kids about how reading a book can be fun.  The world without the INTERNET seems like man must have still been primordial back then, but we did have writing.  And this show demonstrates how we should exploit this ability.

When I was a toddler, I would curl up with my stuffed animals and my books and read along with Reading Rainbow. My favorite story was ""Nosey Mrs. Rat"". After watching the VHS a thousand times, I actually started learning how to read.

When I stumbled across this about 20 minutes ago, I immediately watched Nosey Mrs. Rat and I still remembered the entire story word for word after all of these years. This was an awesome learning tool for me and when I do eventually have kids, I will get them reading rainbow and a few of the accompanying books.

The show exposed kids to high quality books and broadened their view of the world. The books on the show were Caldecott winners, great authors, timeless stories. I love watching the show then going to the library and finding the books and sharing them with my kids. I guess in our day and time, I could bypass the library and buy the Kindle edition. With all the apps, games and devices, we expose our kids to, there is something to be said about good ole plain literacy. This show inspires you to pick up a book.",1361836800,,634,4.427350427350428

2412295,5,B000BBYDU6,We were so sad to learn we could not watch any episodes on our local cable network so finding it on Amazon instant streaming was a blessing.  My 9 yo loves the series and can't enough of all the fascinating facts he learns while watching. And Levar is a great host--keeps the kids (young and old) interested without sounding too cheesy. Thanks Amazon for showcasing this outstanding program.,1360454400,,391,4.75

8084803,3,B000BBYDU6,"I'll give it 3 stars because the show itself is worthy of 5, but due to the fact that Amazon has replaced the classic opening with the newer one I am deducting 2 stars. What, does Amazon think kids need a more modern looking opening in order for the show to hold their attention? If that's the case then those kids won't make it past the 2 minute mark. This show shows it's age, and for some kids I know that that is a big turn off, but changing the opening won't solve that problem, and will actually end up turning away viewers like me who watched this show as a kid, and remember it fondly enough to revisit it now. Most kids won't want to watch this because it looks too dated, and without the classic opening I won't be watching it either. It's a shame too. I know I can watch the classic opening on Youtube to get my nostalgia fix anytime I want, but I shouldn't have to. That opening should be attached to the beginning of these episodes. I shouldn't have to jump back and forth between two different sites just to be able to see the Reading Rainbow I know and love in it's entirety.",1516147200,,1090,4.195238095238095
