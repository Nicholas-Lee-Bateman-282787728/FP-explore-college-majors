1732177,5,B000069HXD,"I'm free!
I am so happy to see this hilarious series become available on DVD. My previous forays into BBC comedies on the digital format have been ""Fawlty Towers"" and ""As Time Goes By"". Both series looked absoutely wonderful. Crisp, clear, and with rich colors. I have no doubt that this new offering of Are You Being Served? will be the same.
Set in old-fashioned Grace Brothers Department Store, ""Are You Being Served?"" was a long running comedy series which followed the day to day antics of the Mens and Ladies Wear departments, both on the same floor. It was, in its own way, a microcosm of society (albeit a slightly off society). You've got a young man who is after the ladies (Mr. Lucas), a young lady who is looking for a man to treat her right (Ms. Brahms), an older woman who changes the color of her hair nearly every episode (Mrs. Slocombe), a gay man (Mr. Humphries), a snooty floorwalker who steps out on his wife occasionally (Captain Peacock), and a slighltly aloof department manager, mostly concerned with the health of the sales figures (Mr. Rumbold). And who can forget the doddering, but lovable, old man who is still in love with his wife after years and years of marriage (Mr. Grainger). The actors do an outstanding job with their roles, and there is plenty of chemistry present between them. It was obvious that they were having an enjoyable time together.
This collection of the first 5 series (or seasons) of the show are a great introduction to the first-time viewer, and an absolute treaure for those of us who have grown to love it over the years. Many of the highlights of the episodes revolve around crazy ideas the staff come up with in order to drum up business, including dressing up in outrageous costumes, adopting a German touristy look, and opening the store early (an idea which the staff puts an abrupt end to in one hilarious episode). Oh, and I still get a kick out of Mrs. Slocombe's references to her cat.
""Are You Being Served?"" ran for twelve years in Britain, and, coincidentally enough, it ran for twelve consecutive years on my local PBS station - a marker of its great humor, fabulous characters, and enduring charm. I can't wait to own it on DVD.",1027382400,32,2199,4.612244897959184

1732235,5,B000069HXD,"I have always loved quick and witty comedy and this is the epitome of that, not to mention the immature side of comedy with sexual innuendos. The best thing about this show is the more I viewed it, the better it got. The characters are so well written and the cast has such great chemistry that the jokes got funnier, the zany situations got more believable, and the whole atmosphere of Grace Brothers was an environment I accepted.

The thing that I liked best about this show was the hierarchy system with strict guidelines that the management liked to enforce on the staff. There is so much red-tape the whole staff has to deal with from how to wear your handkerchief, how you talk, what you say when selling, how you get lunch breaks, what you can do. Not to mention upper management is always coming up with new scheme to save money whether it be cutting off the gas, turning off the lifts for additional hours, and so and on so forth. Every episode is almost a rebellion against upper management to weasel something in whether it be a quick smoke or a sandwich from the canteen. That kind of childish, insignificant rebellion arises emotion in most anyone has we cheer on Mr. Lucas to find another way to avoid detection by his superiors.

Not to mention the staff that is just insane. Whether it is the flamboyant Mr. Humphries spending the weekend with his mother or Captain Peacock always being accused of an affair, there is always something funny going on between the staff.

I can't recommend this show enough for its wit and originality.",1212969600,2,1550,4.588447653429603

I will, very soon, be viewing the DVD's and giving my review on it, even though I know that it is going to be really hilarious.

1732237,5,B000069HXD,What can I say? Buy this set and you won't regret it. This is British humor at its best.,1168732800,2,88,3.6842105263157894
1732238,5,B000069HXD,"This set encompasses the first five seasons of the brilliant British sitcom ""Are You Being Served"" from the 1970s. The show is set in an upscale department store, Grace Brothers, and features the misadventures of the men's and women's departments, which are forced to share a small floor area. Grace Brothers has an aristocratic bent with an extremely well defined rank structure, which sets many of the comedic conflicts in motion. The show is extremely well conceived and written by BBC veterans David Croft and Jeremy Lloyd, but the magic of the show is due largely to the chemistry of the cast.

Most noteworthy in the cast are Mollie Sugden, John Inman, Frank Thornton, Wendy Richard, and Trevor Bannister. For pure laughs Mollie Sugden as Mrs. Slocombe is my favorite (her hair is a different color every week) and is perfect as the slightly pompous and matronly senior salesperson in the ladies department. Her junior, Wendy Richard (who is still on a British soap opera today) is excellent as the slightly crass Cockney lass, Miss Brahams. Unfortunately for Miss Brahams, all the men in the store (except John Inman) desire her, particularly the jocular Mr. Lucas, the junior salesman from menswear. Lucas is known for his wisecracks and disobedient antics which normally elicit a well written barb from one of the ladies (see my title for an example from Mrs. Slocombe.) Frank Thornton is perfect as the floor supervisor, Captain Peacock, and excels at portraying classic English stuffiness with a farcical edge. Second only to Sudgen (or perhaps tied with her) for pure comedic entertainment is John Inman as Mr. Humphries, the flamboyant mincing mama's boy who loves nothing more than measuring an ""inside leg"" (that's ""inseam"" to Americans.) His comic timing, diction, and costumes make Inman impossible to overlook.

This set is well packaged with trivia about the various episodes and several extras, most notably on disc seven which has biographies of Inman, Sugden, and Richard, all of whom have more interesting lives than you might suspect.

This show is essentially clean family fun: there is some innuendo, but no vulgarity of any sort. Virtually anyone can appreciated the at once understated, yet occasionally way over-the-top situations these performers so deftly made into one of the most eminently enjoyable shows ever to come from the UK. I highly recommend ""Are You Being Served,"" a near-perfect sitcom if ever there was one.",1166486400,8,2452,5.0945273631840795
1732239,5,B000069HXD,"Witty, intelligent, sarcastic, and populated with some of the most lovable characters, Are You Being Served is probably the funniest Britcom ever.  It has aged very well, and one can watch it over and over again without feeling sated.  Whether it's the nuanced or pointed jabs at the British society, the not so-subtle allusions to Mr. Humphries' afterwork life, or the language games, there are plenty of laughs to be had.",1119052800,7,423,4.943661971830986
1732240,5,B000069HXD,"It's a great series, I watch it over again and again.

  The sales people on a miserable salary are divided into 'seniors' and 'juniors' and it is unbelivable how desperately 'seniors' try to humilate 'juniors' just to prove to themselves they are better than their wage implies.

  Some of the jokes are easily predictable, like those on Mr. Hamphries's 'other way' or Ms. Sloucomb's she-cat, nevertheless they are a superb humor.
  A technical note: I cannot comprehend why the DVD should be close-captioned (a useless feature) instead of being sub-titled in English (an importand feature for a movie with many British idioms)",1090627200,3,628,5.088235294117647
1732241,5,B000069HXD,"At long last the entire series of this classic Britcom (ten series from 1973 through 1985) is available on two DVD boxed sets.  Commencing with the black-and-white pilot, set one covers the entire first five series (thirty-four 30-minute episodes from 1973-1977).  Incidentally, these are all the series to feature curmudgeonly Mr. Grainger, head of menswear; sadly, Arthur Brough died (aged 73) before series six got under way.  The BBC has done a fantastic job with these DVDs--the quality of the picture is awesome, the sets come complete with the Christmas specials (positioned chronologically in the order originally broadcast), with the icing on the cake being the DVD extras.
The series revolves around the staff of Grace Brothers' Department Store--particulary the staff of menswear and ladieswear.  The ladies' department is headed by the pompous, air-assuming Mrs. Slocombe (Mollie Sugden).  She's a bit of a man eater (or would be could she get her hands on one!) and is forever fretting about Tiddles, her um pussycat!  Her junior is sexy Miss Brahms (Wendy Richard), who is constantly fighting off the advances of Mr. Lucas, the menswear junior.  In between Mr. Lucas and Mr. Grainger is Mr. Humphreys (John Inman).  With his mincing gait, outrageous costumes, and familiar cry of ""I'm free,"" he's my personal favourite--though how can one really choose between this lot as they are ALL superb!  Of course one cannot forget the subtly lecherous floorwalker, Captain Peacock, a pompous ex-army officer (or so he claims).  One gets a sense that this is probably the only position of authority he's ever had, and he milks it for all its worth, barking orders at his underlings at every opportunity.  His favourite target is the rough, bawdy maintenance man, Mr. Mash (replaced by Mr. Harman in the fourth series), a militant trade unionist who loves to goad Cpt. Peacock (and who probably makes more money than he does too!).  And who could forget Mr. Rumbold, the bald-pated, jug-eared department head (like Mollie Sugden, Nicholas Smith was very good-natured in allowing his physical appearance to be the basis of so much humour!); or Young Mr. Grace, the elderly and extremely frail but hilariously lustful store owner (Harold Bennett was 74 when the series began!).
DVD extras consist of three 30-minute profiles (John Inman (1999), Mollie Sugden (1998), and Wendy Richard (2001)), each of which provides a brief bio, snippets from the various television productions in which the actor has been involved, remembrances from fellow actors (on the Inman and Richard profiles these include writers Jeremy Lloyd and David Croft plus all the surviving members of the original AYBS cast with the exception of Nicholas Smith).  John Inman's forte is pantomime, and his profile includes snippets from some of the pantos he's done.  Mollie Sugden's profile includes remembrances by actor William Moore (her late husband), and the focus, careerwise, is shared between AYBS and The Liver Birds (her two biggest series).  Wendy Richard's profile is the only one that is narrated, and it contains in a nutshell much of what one finds in her delightful autobiography ""Wendy Richard...no 's'"".  Careerwise, it focuses on AYBS and Eastenders (the two main series she's done).  It's the most personal of the three, and a special treat is hearing a snippet of Mike Sarne's 1962 song ""Come Outside"" which featured Richard and was responsible for launching her career.  The final feature is ""Are You Being Confused?"", a text-based dictionary of British slang.
With scripts liberally laced with double entendres, innuendos and puns, and a cast of characters made all the more memorable by some of the most capable actors in British comedy, this is character comedy at its best.  It's an outstanding collection of a true Britcom classic which I highly recommend.  I also highly recommend Richard Webber's excellent tribute book ""Are You Being Served? A Celebration of 25 Years"" (a 1998 UK publication).",1069027200,18,3993,5.1612403100775195
1732242,5,B000069HXD,"After years of trying to see every episode of this hilarious sitcom on PBS only to have endless time changes, schedule reshufflings, and telethons get in the way, I am so glad that the BBC has put all 69 episodes out on DVD so quickly.  This first set represents the best AYBS? material with original cast members Arthur Brough (Mr. Grainger), Harold Bennett (Young Mr. Grace), Larry Martyn (Mr. Mash), and Trevor Bannister (Mr. Lucas). From the black & white pilot through ""It Pays to Advertise"" from season 5, this set also includes my all-time favorite AYBS? episode ""Big Brother,"" when Mr. Rumbold installs a closed circuit television in the store to uncover a burglar but instead uses it to spy on the Grace Brother's staff.  The artistic details of both AYBS? sets are very nice.  After choosing an episode, the elevator conductor announces the title and the lift doors open to reveal the plot.
What I also enjoy about both DVD sets for this series are the extras in volume 7.  In this set, you get half hour bios on John Inman, Molly Sugden, and Wendy Richard.  Each bio includes pre-AYBS? clips (Sugden in ""The Liver Birds,"" ""Coronation Street;"" Richard in ""The Newcomers,"" ""Hugh and I,"" ""Up Pompeii!,"" ""Dad's Army,"" etc.).  In Richard's bio, there are many clips from the long-running soap opera EastEnders.  They also include interview clips with Inman, Bannister, Frank Thornton, Richard, and Sugden as well as others that look like they were recorded fairly recently.  Why was this series so successful?:  Because the characters were wonderful, the acting superb, and the writing irreverent and just plain funny!  This set (as well as series 6-10) has a very 1970s design and looks great on display.  Any fan will cherish both sets and, as Mrs. Slocombe says, ""I am unanimous in this.""",1067904000,23,1797,4.859016393442623
1732243,1,B000069HXD,I have never understood why people find this to be the pinnacle of British Comedy. Once you get past the numerous jokes about Mrs. Slocum's.... cat and a flaming Mr. Humphreys you have very little left to justify it's long run except that it was probably the right show in the right place at the right time. In retrospect it is lacking. Many will disagree with me but that's life.,1066176000,2,380,4.442857142857143

The 30 somewhat episodes on the 6 included discs are presented with crystal clear audio and beautiful video.  Chapter stops for each episode are included, and some little bits of trivia are included.  Disc 7 features special interview sessions with John Inman, Mollie Sugden, and Wendy Richard.
The episodes are present chronologically on each disc, which is better than the VHS releases, which seemed to throw 3 random episodes onto a tape.  Experience the series from start to 1977, from the black-and-white Pilot to ""It Pays to Advertise.""  All episodes presented include all that had Mr. Grainger (Arthur Brough).  This set ends before episodes with different a senior from the men's department.  Hopefully, since we were privileged to get these that it's a sign for future releases of the remaining 7 years of episodes.
My only complaint is that this set boasts that it has trailers as a bonus.  The trailers are for other TV series!  I know trailers probably don't exist for this series, but at least they could have been held off to one disc and listed as ""Previews of other TV series.""
While this set may be pricy,  believe me you won't regret spending the money if you're a true fan.  This show was really given the attention it deserved on these discs, and I highly recommend them to any fan of the show or of British television.",1054684800,24,1468,4.713725490196079

The DVDs are a further improvement, and you see that their production values were slightly higher than one might previously have thought.
The best part about this set is that it is COMPLETE for the first five seasons; I know of no PBS station that has run the two Christmas episodes or ""Top Hat and Tails"" that are available here.  I've also never known them to run ""A Bliss Girl"" or ""The Old Order Changes"" (where both Mr. Graces appear together), but I will have to wait for the second box set to be able to see those.
The episodes are in correct chronological order, which will probably make one problem stand out - their continuity stank.  The department looked the same as it forgetfully moved from floor to floor and Mr. Rumboldt's office gained and lost windows.
If you enjoy the series, and want to upgrade from a set of homemade VHS recordings, definitely skip to DVD over the VHS tapes.  If you've got some of the VHS tapes, at least get the two DVDs with the impossible-to-find episodes, if not the whole set.",1041465600,3,1197,4.5488372093023255

My husband and I finally bought it this month as a present to ourselves.  We started watching ""AYBS?"" about 10 years ago and in a space of 7 years or so managed to tape all episodes off PBS. The tapes were getting old and yes there are scenes on the DVDs that are not aired on PBS, not to mention the times I didn't get the beginning of the show on tape, or an announcer started speaking over the credits!
These episodes (the Mr. Grainger years) are the classics and my favorites. Once Mr. Spooner showed up (and Grainger was gone) the quality of the show went down hill.  Yes, there are some funny bits in the later years, but as a whole, this set is the epitome of ""Are You Being Served?""
The picture and sound are even better than watching it on PBS, nevermind an old VHS copy.  Plus the episodes are split up into scenes on the DVD- even easier to find specific ""spots"". Well worth the money spent.",1040947200,2,1011,4.22279792746114

As I watched the DVD edition, I kept thinking, ""I don't remember that scene."" I decided to compare my tapes to the DVD and found that I wasn't losing my mind, there were indeed cuts in the PBS version.

1732262,5,B000069HXD,This series is great.  The DVDs are spectacular.  Even today some of the jokes seem a bit racy.  And maybe there would be some who get offended.  But I find Are you Being Served? incredibly funny.  The DVD collection is great.  And I think the 7th DVD with a few interviews with the cast to be a great bonus.  It's not much but it's nice to see them talk about the show and their careers.  I am glad I decided to get the collection.,1036972800,2,432,4.059523809523809
1732263,5,B000069HXD,"If you're like me, you've probably been catching random episodes of this fantastic 1970s British comedy on your local PBS station for years.  If you're like me, you might have some on recorded on VHS with poor picture quality.  And if you're like me, the previous official VHS releases with only about three episodes per video were simply too darn expensive to purchase.  This DVD set is a dream come true!  Pristine video and audio better than the original PBS broadcasts I've watched, this has the show's first five seasons complete, including two Christmas specials and a ""lost"" episode never shown on American TV.  The seventh disc has three 30-minute documentaries on three of the main cast members, Mollie Sugden, John Inman, and Wendy Richard.  Sure, the price is high, but you're getting over 1,000 minutes of constantly re-watchable entertainment!  Oh, what I wouldn't have given for a few John Inman audio commentaries, though...  Still, I'm certainly looking forward to the second set, completing the best British comedy series ever.",1035417600,15,1044,5.1
1732264,5,B000069HXD,"This is why I am happy I have a job AND a DVD player. This purchase is well the price... I used to watch this series in high school and still remember the day Mr. Humphries came over to the local PBS Station (1000 people showed up at his hotel!). If you are a fan and are on the fence, trust me- the quality of the video alone as well as the nostalgia factor makes this worth the purchase.",1031097600,3,389,3.9367088607594938
1732265,5,B000069HXD,"I just received the 7-disc set & have watched much of it. In addition to all episodes (34 in all) from the 1st 5 seasons, there is a terrific bonus disc with several retrospectives/documentaries on different members of the cast. It's entertaining to see them today & hear them relate stories from the show.  The episodes themselves come through very well on DVD.  I was pleasantly surprised by the picture quality. The color is vivid, and the picture is very sharp.  You wouldn't know that you were watching a show from 25-30 years ago! Sound is also very good & clear.  There are nice extras on the discs also such as trivia & navigation menus are great, giving fast access to your favorite episodes.",1030752000,5,701,4.629032258064516

Every type of person from a long haired tattooed men to elderly grandmothers will appear. The humor found within this collection crosses all boundaries of humor, and attract a wide variety of fans. The other aspect of the show that, I belive, attracts people to it is the sense of family, and familiarity found within the cast. Every age group and economic class is represented very well in the series. You also get a real sense that the actors do get along well outside of the show, it creates a great atmosphere. This show is a total original!",1029974400,4,665,4.414634146341464
1732267,4,B000069HXD,"Although I wasn't around to see the original run of ""Are You Being Served?"", thanks to PBS I have come to appreciate this ususual, but often hilarious show. The double entendres are funny and sometimes surprising, especially since these shows aired on British TV (mention of Mrs. Slocombe's ""..."" is a standard in every episode). The early episodes are better than the later ones, especially when Mr. Lucas (my favorite character) was replaced by the decidedly un-funny Mr. Spooner. I'm glad these episodes have finally made the move to DVD, since the show is definitely a classic of the genre.",1029456000,4,594,4.95

I received the entire box set from my daughters and it was the BEST birthday present I ever got!!! I watch at least 3 episodes every night. The brilliantly written script, superb acting, and perfect comic timing are awe inspiring. Mr. Lucas and Mr. Humphries are a scream when they criticize the management and the customers! Hang in there and Google any British slang terms you don't understand and you will love it even more. My fave episodes are Cold Comfort, No Sale, Anything You Can Do, and Fire Practice. I love Mollie Sugden as Mrs. Slocombe, too, and Larry Martyn as Mr. Mash. Worth every penny and then some!!!",1492905600,,706,4.48062015503876
