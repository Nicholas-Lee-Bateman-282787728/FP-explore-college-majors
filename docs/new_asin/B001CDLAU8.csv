3511131,4,B001CDLAU8,"I had no intention of renting this movie when I went to the video store; the store happened to be having a two-for-one rental special and the plot sounded interesting to me (boy and mother forced to move to isolated village due to boy's rare skin condition and boy discovers ""something"" is in the woods).  I have seen MANY horror movies over the years, so I expected it to be another forgettable one.
I must compliment the director for managing to creep me out - not an easy task - with more than one scene.  The scene where Santi was walking through the woods will stick with me, but the scene where he falls asleep on the couch was even better.  It's hard to give more detail without spoiling the plot, but I liked how and why the town suspected the boy, though I would have liked to see the movie explore that a little more after the funeral scene (which was very well done).  While the explanation/ending wasn't the most original idea, I didn't have a problem with it and liked that I didn't find myself thinking ""are you kidding me?"" when it arrived.  The acting was well done, but the cinematography and the excellent use of sound really made this movie.  Once again, a foreign horror movie impressed me more than the usual American product.  Well worth a rental.",1239062400,,1269,4.467532467532467
3511132,4,B001CDLAU8,"I recommend this movie. It is the rare combination of skillful direction and cinematography with a plausible, scary plot. Too many horror movies rely on blood and gore to mask the lack of craftsmanship, originality, and talent involved in their production. In Shiver, the acting is excellent, the scenery is beautiful, the plot is more plausible and artfully presented than most, and (most importantly) it delivers some serious chills without relying on the cliched nonsense we have come to expect from movies of this genre. It is an interesting, exciting, original cinematic experience created by a skilled group of professionals.

The version I watched was offered in Spanish with English subtitles. While some may not enjoy this format, I assure you that after a few minutes, and once you become involved in the story, it will be a worthwhile, rewarding cinematic experience.",1231113600,7,878,5.183098591549296
3511133,5,B001CDLAU8,"n Shiver, Junio Valverde plays Santi (also plays Santi in Devil's Backbone) a kid who suffers from an allergy to sunlight that forces his mother to move to a small village in northern Spain. The village sits in the mountains and gets significantly less sunlight than the place they were living, so Santi is able to go out during the day and be a normal kid. When a classmate sees something in the woods, Santi and two other kids end up trekking into the woods to find it. One boy ends up dead and Santi is the suspect. DNA testing reveals that he was not the one to kill the boy, but then another man is killed and Santi happens to be nearby yet again. But this time Santi gets a good look at the killer and no one believes him.

A great horror flick! It's suspenseful and the acting is great. There's also a nice little twist at the end that could be considered somewhat predictable, but worked for me.",1227312000,11,903,4.280701754385965

3511135,2,B001CDLAU8,"What begins as a decent atmospheric, suspenseful thriller, dives deeply into After School Special territory, and (without giving away the ending) ends in the last frames with worst kind of cheap, C-horror twist.

The story was good and fairly believable. The acting, for most of the cast, was very good. The suspense quotient was decent. There were some incongruities with Santi's character, and this troubling inconsistency was maddening and really broke the suspense of disbelief.

Had the director stuck with one vision, preferably the closer-to-reality, non-supernatural story, this would have been a decent flick. Instead it seemed to bounce back and forth, and with that ending, he seemed to just throw in the towel.",1314489600,3,722,5.324561403508772
3511136,4,B001CDLAU8,"It's going to take more than a conveniently scheduled night school and a pair of sunglasses to assist Santi in coping with photophobia (not an actual fear of sunlight; just overly sensitive to it). A change in location might do the trick, but Santi's mother feels Lapland might be a bit on the extreme side. The consolation prize is moving to a remote village in northern Spain that is surrounded by mountains, thus limiting the country folk to daylight on a regular basis. Something else seems to surround said village... a fear, a superstition, if you will, of what walks through the woods... When legends begin to form into a possible reality, does the real evil reside amidst the wilderness, or from the new residents of the town? I mean xeroderma is a most understandable symptom from Santi's condition, but enlarged canine teeth? Yes, members of Spain's horror film gurus in the 21st Century (that Guillermo del Toro seemed to have started) have assembled again (producers Alvaro Augustin and Javier Ugarte; production designer Pilar Revuelta; Junio Valverde as Santi) to make another visually absorbing but, unlike the others, slightly disapointing. However, considering the pedigree of the filmmakers at hand, slightly disapointing still equates to an above average horror film, which includes some of the scariest deep woods scenes ever. Note: Audio and subtitles are available for both Spanish and English, but I would recommend to do without the English dub (which has that all too obvious soundstage aura and lacks a lot of enthusiasm in the dialogue) unless you absolutely abhor reading subtitles. 6.75/10",1293753600,2,1618,5.132575757575758

3511139,3,B001CDLAU8,"Eskalofrio (Isidro Ortiz, 2008)

I have seen it said in other reviews that Eskalofrio (in English, Shiver) avoids the trajectory of the American horror film. Here, of course, one should read the implicit ""bland"" and ""boring"" just in from of ""American"" in that phrase, and to be sure, the American horror industry, especially in the studio system, does smack of bland and boring on a regular basis. That does not mean, however, that every foreign horror film is better than every big-budget American horror film (I qualify this because even the meanest defender of all things foreign over all things American would not dispute, I hope, that there is much excitement, if not much talent, to be had in the indie, direct-to-video world where horror is thriving). Eskalofrio is a perfect example of this; in fact, it travels that exact American horror-industry trajectory, though it does so with slightly more grace than one would get from Hollywood.

Santi (The Devil's Backbone's Junio Valverde) is a teenager with a marked sensitivity to light and growing canines. His doctor advises his mother, Julia (Blame It on Fidel!'s Mar Sodupe, looking somewhat haggard here, but still, has the camera loved any woman's face more in recent years?), to move out to the country, where there are entire regions where the daylight is short. Thus, Julia and Santi pack up for one of those lovely, provincial villages in northern Spain, where Santi can live something akin to a normal life--except that the villagers are immediately convinced the kid's vampire. All except for Angela (Blanca Suarez, currently enjoying fame on TV in The Boarding School), the daughter of the local constable, who takes a shine to Santi. It doesn't help his case that a sheep showed up dead, throat torn out, soon after Julia and Santi arrived. Things get worse for him when a couple of kids, who had been bullying Santi, also turn up dead after the three of them are in the woods and Santi gets lost (they ditched him, naturally). Santi and Angela, along with Santi's city-slicker friend Leo (Jimmy Barnatan; American viewers can catch him on the novela Los Serranos) who's up for an unauthorized visit, discover a legend about a local feral child who may be responsible. Needless to say, the police are skeptical, and all the while local landowner Dimas (Alatriste's Francesc Orella) is screaming for Santi's head on a platter.

Is there anything about that synopsis that tells you this is a markedly different film than Hollywood would crank out? Of course not, because it's not. Though whether any American horror film made in the past decade would be informed by Herzog's The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser is questionable to say the least. Still, the unjustly-accused outsider who has to solve the mystery of the town's murders because he himself is a suspect? Come on, now. That's a plot as well-worn as mystery novels themselves.

Not to say there isn't a lot to like here. The acting is strong from all involved (and can you imagine an American beauty queen allowing herself to look as frowsy as Mar Sodupe does in this film? The last time I can remember that happening in American cinema was Cameron Diaz' turn in Being John Malkovich). The production design is downright sexy, which should be no surprise; production designer Pilar Revuelta last worked on El Laberinto del Fauno; she won an Oscar for it. Josep Civit did the cinematography, which is also gorgeous, and also not a surprise (Gaudi Afternoon was his work, as was Central Station back in the eighties). It's a very pretty thing, and worth watching for that reason, but don't expect to be wowed by the plot. ***",1264550400,3,3642,4.869354838709677
3511140,2,B001CDLAU8,"Guys, I really hate to be the party pooper in this group of glowing reviews, but...oh well.  I just didn't find this all that scary.  This movie is from the producer of The Orphanage and Pan's Labryinth, which were far superior movies than this one.  I won't go into detail about the premise of the movie, as the other reviews have already divulged all that, I will just say that as an avid watcher of scary horror movies, not just gory ones, that this was not all that scary.  If you liked Twilight, you'll like this movie because there are a lot of Twilight moments between the girl and the hero.  The girl even resembles Bella quite a bit.  If you liked Blair Witch Project, you'll like this movie too, because there are several scenes which mimic the ""shaky camera at night heavy breathing looking into the bushes"" scenes of Blair Witch.  The actual supposed scary entity of the film turns out to be neither ghost nor real monster, in other words, a let down.  And can someone please explain to me what the whole point of his sun-shunning disease was all about?  It didn't have any direct bearing to the plot of the film at all, and they would have still had their movie without this distraction.  Was it to prove that everyone could blame him for the murders, because of his canine teeth, which didn't make any sense either?  Whatever.  I'll probably be donating this one to the local library.",1262304000,3,1398,4.503968253968254
3511141,4,B001CDLAU8,"This film was not what I was expecting.  I like foreign horror films, especially Spanish (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Orphanage/dp/B0015ET3YO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Orphanage</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Nameless/dp/B0007XG16W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Nameless</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pan-s-Labyrinth/dp/B000O76ZQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pan's Labyrinth</a>(not horror, I know)), and it's probably because they have innovative storylines that do not lead to predictable endings.  Always visually stunning, with great moody scores, they just seem to have a great grasp on capturing an eerie mood and dragging the audience in.

Shiver is no exception to mastering the sensory magic of foreign horror films.  But Shiver is a departure in its storyline.  Santi is allergic to light, so his mother moves out to rustic valley to help his health.  Once Santi appears, strange things begin to happen in the woods with fatal results.  What is happening, and how will Santi prove he is not the cause?  Great twists and turns keep you interested and breaths new life into the horror genre.

Well done film with an innovative story that deserves a look.  Recommended.",1257120000,,1328,7.0920245398773005
3511142,4,B001CDLAU8,"With Halloween around the corner, ""Shiver"" is a nice treat from some of the more typical horror movies currently on DVD.

The story revolves around a teenager with a rare allergy to sunlight who moves with his mother to a mountain village where shadows of the mountains filter out most of the sun's harmful rays - allowing the teen to have a more social home and school life. However, when police start finding dead bodies, the boy who must live in the dark is suspected of the murders. There is a mysterious being in the woods of the mountain which the teenager must discover in order to clear his name.

This was a great find I rented on Netflix, but ended up purchasing on Amazon.com for a friend of mine who said he also enjoyed the foreign film. There are some good movies coming out of Spain and other countries right now that are well made, have interesting cinemaphotography, and good actors. ""Shiver"" is one of them. Although the movie might not quite give you the shivers, the movie's name certainly defines the main character's mental state during the ordeal he and his family and friends end up going through.",1252713600,,1121,4.6
3511143,4,B001CDLAU8,"""Shiver"" is a horror-thriller from Spain [originally titled ""Eskalofrio""] that subtly gets under one's skin without resorting to cliched plotlines, cheesy acting, and over-the-top blood and gore effects.

Santi [Junio Valverde] is a teenage boy who suffers from photophobia [an extreme aversion to sunlight] and lives with his mother Julia [Mar Sodupe] in the city.  Upon doctor's orders, the pair decide to move to Lapland, a sheltered valley where the days are short. Santi and his mother are hopeful that he can finally lead a normal life, and not be treated like a pariah. But things turn out worse than expected - whilst out in the woods with two other boys, one gets attacked and killed, and Santi becomes the prime suspect. The villagers begin to turn menacing and threaten mother and son, even after DNA tests prove Santi's innocence. Then, Santi again finds himself a murder suspect when a man he meets in the woods gets killed. This time, Santi sees the 'thing' attacking the man, but his claims are waived aside as fanciful thoughts by the police. Along the way, Santi discovers some interesting clues in his rental home, objects left behind by the previous tenants that may help him solve the mystery of the creature stalking the woods.

The movie is highly atmospheric, and though the plot felt a bit contrived midway through [when I was able to deduce what was going on], it is the skillful direction that provides viewers with a creepy viewing experience. There are some true jump in your seat moments here, and the best part is one doesn't really know what to expect in these tense scenes [one particular scene is the one where Santi is asleep on the couch].

The movie is basically carried by Junio Valverde's performance as Santi - his alienation and perception of being an outcast shines through in his performance and elicits one's sympathy. Mar Sodupe puts in a credible performance as Santi's loving mother. The other characters, such as Santi's estranged father [who makes a curious appearance midway through the movie] and even the police inspector are lackluster and forgettable. Of course, special credit also goes to the 'thing' that stalks the woods - I felt that it's performance was understated yet chillingly effective in conveying horror.

Unlike many predictable Hollywood horror movies, this Spanish horror flick is intelligent and has a couple of different themes running through it, and a discerning viewer will appreciate how all these are presented in the movie. Fans of atmospheric horror movies will enjoy this [note: I watched it in Spanish with English subtitles, and it did not detract from my enjoyment of the movie].",1242259200,3,2661,4.9707865168539325
8287233,4,B001CDLAU8,"I  was going to use this film for my Spanish class, but my wife said that it would probably get me fired!  Still, I feel most of my secondary school students, if not the school administrators nor some of their parents, would love it!  The cinematography is imaginative, and the story has several different variations to a familiar theme.  The darkness of the deep mountain valley reflects the darkness of several human souls, beginning with the villain but also continuing with the high school peers, both in Madrid and in the mountain town, who torment the hero.  I saw this several years ago on the Independent Film Channel when that channel still showed independent films.  (Now, you are unlikely to see such an original film on that channel; they've gone with the proverbial ""lowest common denominator"" instead of showing original works such as Shiver). Its dark atmosphere reminds me of Blue Velvet. Also, I love the peninsular accent, which for me is more soothing than the rapid Caribbean Spanish accents with which I am more familiar.",1490227200,,1042,4.892045454545454
8287234,3,B001CDLAU8,"I purchased this film, shaver, along with pans labyrinth and the orphanage for some of my Spanish language students. I found this film to be not as of superior quality as the other two. it just seem to me that the plot line was not as dynamic and thick as the other two films. I think that often times we compare American horror films to the standard of European horror films and I find that most often the horror films produced in Europe or other Spanish speaking countries to be far more interesting and push the envelope a little more. I do also find it interesting that the main character in this is a teenager who is sensitive to light and growing canines is also from the movie the Devils backbone, which I have also shown my Spanish language students before as well. In the movie a doctor advises the boys mother to move out of town to an area where all of the region is in minimal daylight. Thus the boy and his mother move to northern Spain where he can live a normal life. Except for one thing and that is that the villagers are immediately convinced that The main character is a vampire. This is of course with one exception for the character Angela who the boy meets at school. The plot then twist when a sheep shows up dead and then some children die adding a scary factor to the plotline. The plotline then develops even more when it is discovered a legend about a feral child that lives in the area that might be responsible for the animal and child deaths. I have to say on the overall that I thought this film was decent but not superb like some of the other Spanish-language horror films I have seen before. Others such as pans labyrinth that, the Devils backbone, and the orphanage were far better than this one. I got the whole idea of the boy being allergic to the sun, but the enlarged canine teeth? That was a bit far-fetched and didn't make sense to me nor my students. After showing the film to them they compared it to the other films that we had previously watched and said that it was nowhere near as engaging or entertaining as the other Spanish-language films that we had watched. Thus, I think that I can say that I would not use this film again because it was a bit underwhelming and slightly disappointing to say the least.",1458604800,2,2256,4.3610451306413305

This is a Spanish speaking horror film with English subtitles. I have to admit this was perfectly made in the nostalgic horror story telling and most of all imagination department.

A beautiful woven fairytale type of setting in modern-day times. You have a young kid that suffers from photophobia, an intense allergy to light, especially sunlight. The old and new tease saying something in the sense of vampire. He's just a kid with skin problems and the sun burns him creating people to gossip.

The movie is brilliantly acted and vividly created in the hair-raising department. There's a darkness to it. An underlining creepy, evil campfire tale.

Your main character Santi moves to a new town where the days are short and the cloud cover hides the sun most of the time. In the new town Santi and his mother are outsiders. The home they live in, they discover that a German family used to live there but there's a mystery and suspense that has been denied the truth to the people.
