8734218,5,B015P5WKZC,"I must admit to having had doubts about this purchase.  There is no other DVD of ""Undine"", one of my favorite stories.  And now, a ""version for children""?  I needn't have worried. Tristan Schulze has done a totally wonderful job, the lead singers are all young and very impressive vocalists, the staging is attractive and, at 58 minutes, it goes over painlessly [think of the Met's ""Flute"" for children, another successful adaptation].  It manages to speak both to children and their opera-loving parents.  I loved it.  So will you. A detail I forgot to point out the packaging is a lovrly piece of work, and user friendly.",1518566400,,623,4.775700934579439
