 The Good Shepard rolls along like a flat tire,

blown out under its own weight.

 The key points are predictable, the performances placid,

and the running time (about three hours), a marathon.

a look, but I'd wait for HBO.",1167091200,3,292,4.588235294117647
2751690,5,B000MXPE7Y,"It is easy to believe that rise of the Central Intelligence Agency--and the political-personal toll which such a process consequently exerted on its founders simply might invoke 'James Bond in the swing era' for a screenplay.

With the war in Iraq and question's about our own government's accountability (not to mention their family ties to Yale and Skull and Bones) this film definitely is atypical and thus much more somber holiday fare. It raises so many serious and ultimately disturbing questions about America's past--and by extension---current foreign policy objectives.

This story focuses on the partially-fictionalized Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), a founder of what ultimately is now known as the Central Intelligence Agency. Wilson's initial innocence and idealism is tried over the course of those pivotal years.

Recruited to join the Office of Strategic Services during World War II, Wilson earns performance kudos at the expense of ultimately loosing what made himself 'him'; humanity. The constant state of paranoia which he is required to operate under finally eats away at both him and his family life.

Wilson's real life counterparts James Jesus Angelton (a long-serving CIA director) and Richard Bissell (a covert operations specialist) provided inspiration for this film. Angelton also ultimately became engulfed by the very 'national security' system which he had long-term involvement with.

The scripting and directing of this film easily maintained a 'suspense' environment without resorting to flashy special effects. Wilson and his colleagues are not 'bad' people per say, but they are living on the edges of both American and International society by virtue of having creating gray areas which cannot be disclosed to others out of 'necessity'.",1166918400,9,1772,5.5

The film is as dry as can be. My brother and I actually stopped on the way home after the film just to get something to quench our parched mouths. Everyone save you money on this one. The theater was packed and I feel everyone was disappointed. I am not sure who edited this but it easily could have been the same bad film with only 2 hours of footage. I am amazed that such fascinating subject matter could be made so boring.  That sucky phony lame film National Treasure was better and I hate that film.",1166832000,5,696,4.1940298507462686
2751692,5,B000MXPE7Y,"The Good Shepherd is a very very good film that I would be reluctant to recommend to many because despite it having a fictionalized history of the genesis of the CIA as its setting, and its cold look at real spycraft, it is really a very quiet and cerebral character study of the sacrifices one man makes for the sake of his country, and the toll taken not only upon himself but also those around him by the life of duplicity, distrust, compromise and real betrayal that this engenders.  I don't know how a 2-1/2 hour movie with so button-downed and taciturn a central character as Matt Damon's Edward Wilson will play in multiplex land, but I give all due credit to Damon for embodying this tightly-wrapped, detached man and Robert DeNiro as director for having the courage to center his film on such a cool and enigmatic protagonist.

Using the 1961 Cuban Bay of Pigs disaster as a framing device, we flashback to 1939 Yale and we see Damon's Edward Wilson as a young Eli soon to be inducted into Skull and Bones where he will join the American WASP elite.  I'm glad DeNiro spends a bit of time here as we see Wilson as a brilliant and sensitive young man, seemingly with both heart and humor, with a potential to go in many directions in his life.  A telling secret of his life is revealed in his Skull & Bones initiation, and soon, for several reasons, he is singled out for the World War II OSS clandestine service and sent to London, England.  But not before impregnating the sister of one of his elite brethern and duly marrying her on the eve of his departure.  This marriage will be costly to Edward immediately and eventually to his wife and son as the years progress.

Wartime London intrigue ensues and later postwar Berlin and the beginning of the Cold War.  We watch as Edward not only learns his craft, but we see how he begins to shelve his emotions, tighten his grip on himself and don an impenetrable mask of detached stoicism. Edward Wilson is becoming ""serious and humorless"" and as he shuts-down only glimpses of the younger man appear. Through these scenes we also meet several key characters in the espionage game that will play important parts throughout the story, not the least being the man who will be Edward's opposite number in the KGB, code named Ulysses.  The KGB man tells Edward he is code-named ""Mother"" and that his propensity for silence is noted and respected.  Both men realize their opposite will be formidable and that this will be a very serious and deadly game they are about to play.

Edward returns home post-war to a marriage with a stranger, a son he doesn't relate well to and has little time for, and to the deadly games of the Cold War, dueling with the KGB in proxy wars around the world while coping with moles and betrayal and the internecine wars of bureaucracy.  It all comes full circle in ways tragic and sad.

Matt Damon had an incredible challenge playing a man so closed that almost no one knows him.  Apparently a composite of several early CIA founders, most notably the brilliant, mole-obsessed James Jesus Angleton, this character is a man that expects betrayal, can trust no one around him and ultimately cannot trust himself in the form of his own emotions.  Damon somehow conveys the man's inner anguish without breaking his stern outer resolve.  And yet we see flashes, glimpses of the man's regrets, of his lost capacity to love and give of himself.

There are coincidences and some doubtful scenes and situations that Edward particpates in or witnesses that seem a bit contrived but are necessary to broaden the scope of the film, and it is a truncated history by necessity.  I can't speak to whether some of the methods and tactics as shown, in particular one interrogation scene, are accurate for the period, and the assertion by a defector that the Soviet Union is bankrupt and hollow rings false for 1961, but overall the mood and tone of the piece seems right.  The nonchalance of the privileged elite in assuming leadership roles and the WASP heritage of the OSS and its offspring is presented well and no doubt persists into our world if you think of the Skull & Bones contest of the 2004 Presidential election.

At any rate, I applaud DeNiro and company for taking on such non-General audience material. This is John Le Carre territory, and has much more in common with the Alec Guinness versions of his spy stories as seen in the TV productions of ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" and ""Smiley's People"", with an equally inscrutable central character, than Bourne or Bond or whatever.  This is espionage carried out by a polyglot confusion of often damaged people: patriots, true-believers, careerists, liars, cheats, thieves, sadists and worse--the callous, greedy and corrupt.  As one of them says spies are ultimately ""romantics"" and romantics are ever doomed to disappointment and failure.  The DeNiro character (based on Wild Bill Donovan, founder and legend of OSS)says ""in the end we're all clerks"" or ""bootmakers for the King"" as another says.

Watching the idealism of Damon's Edward Wilson harden into the ruthless pragmatism of the cool and calculating ultimate bureaucrat was a chilling and worthwhile experience for me.  It is a hard, often cruel world we live in, and the world these people inhabit is very hard indeed, and we cannot expect the people we ask to live there not to be somehow affected. Edward's final compromise with himself and his ideals is that he can make no compromise with who he is and what he does.  They are now one and the same.  Ideals have been replaced by sheer, rigorous efficiency, and conscience by lies within lies and secrets within secrets

The cast supporting Damon (Hurt, Turturro, Baldwin, Crudup, Jolie, Gambon et al)is fine. The production likewise. In an interview DeNiro said that he hopes to continue this story with at least one more film.  I hope this one is successful enough that he gets the chance to do so, as I would like to see this story taken forward all the way up to our times.  I remember when films like The Spy Who Came In From the Cold or All the President's Men could be hits.  I hope this film can find its audience as well, for it is a fine effort.",1166832000,302,6199,4.664830119375574
2751693,3,B000MXPE7Y,"Lack of focus leads to lack of concern for story or characters

December 19, 2006

""The Good Shepard"" may be a lot of different things, but none of these hold it together as a whole. Similar to last year's ""Syriana"", ""The Good Shepard"" explores the nature and history of the C.I.A. by weaving together multiple storylines, characters, and continents across several decades, to confounding effect.

Taking place between World War II and the Bay of Pigs invasion, the movie follows Edward Wilson (Damon) a bright Yale graduate who becomes involved with in the web of secrecy that ultimately becomes the C.I.A. A member of ""Skull and Bones"", the university's secret society, early in the movie Edward is approached by the F.B.I. to spy on his Nazi-sympathizing teacher. Taking up the offer, Edward begins doing missions for the O.S.S., eventually leading to working in London for the K.G.B. Eventually Edward rises amongst the ranks and is selected to participate in the C.I.A., a newly established U.S. government organization. During this time, Edward gets married to a woman he impregnated, and has a son and wife who he never sees.

As he travels through the US, Europe, and eventually Africa, Edward works with people he at one time were told were his enemies, he turns on his friends and co-workers when he feels their allegiances slip, and true to the warning he was given by many, he learns can never trust anyone. This is all an excellent idea; seeing the life-consuming power of lies, deception, and espionage through the eyes of one man. In realty, however, the movie moves around too much, trying to cover all the bases, all the while wearing out the viewer into simply not caring anymore.

When we first meet Edward, it is the 1960's, and he is reviewing a ""top secret"" case file while a crack team interprets a black and white photo and audio recording to discover where they came from. Just as our interest is peaked with these events, we flash back to the late 30's, and Edward is mud wrestling while he is peed on as initiation into his school's secret society. Lying nude, he is accepted into their club by a masked black-cloaked figure. Again, just as the audience shifts gears and becomes wrapped up in a much different, but equally as intriguing story, we travel back further, to the mid 20's, when Edward is a boy witnessing his father's suicide. From here we go back to Yale, and his poetry teacher, who seems to be a mentor to Edward, is enticing him to stay in his study for more than just schoolwork. While all of these stories are very interesting on their own, as a collection of 7 to 12 minute accounts, strung together solely because they happened to the same man, they make for a very tedious nearly 3-hour-long movie.

Early on, Edward falls in love with a deaf woman, but must marry another who he had a foolish encounter with. Years later, towards the end of the movie he sleeps with his secretary; a deaf woman. While it may seem that Edward saw this woman as an outlet for his desires of his lost love of youth, this idea is never developed. When his son, who Edward seems to have only spent a few months of his life with, joins the same elite secret club as Edward had done, the 15 or 20 minutes of time spent here are not enough to develop anything remarkable. Ultimately, the back-and-forth time frame and lack of clear focus made for a very all-over-the-place experience.

Many characters Edward encountered throughout his life repeated a warning: you would never be able to trust anyone. Friends he made at Yale became enemies later in life, mentors and father figures betrayed him or Edward betrayed them. It would seem the disorientation and not knowing what happened when or with whom may have been a part of DeNiro's vision. However, instead of getting the feeling I was a C.I.A. operative getting fed bits of intelligence, I began to care less and less about the tiny tidbits, and just wanted my operation to be all over with and done.

The performances, though great all around, and the locales and shots, though pitch-perfect in mood, made for some excellently-crafted 5 to 20 minute short movies, but as a whole, did not add up to much at all.",1166659200,2,4189,4.674355495251017

2751699,5,B000MXPE7Y,"This was an unexpectedly poignant story about a man who gives up a normal life to serve in the intelligence service.  The movie's framing story is a search for who betrayed the CIA operations leading up to the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961.  Told through flashbacks in Edward Wilson's life (played by Matt Damon), we see his thought process on who the traitor might be unfold in his search for the possible mole.  His final conclusion to the mystery is heart-breaking.  I was most impressed by how the movie portrayed the battle of wits between Wilson and his Soviet counterpart ""Ulysses"".  It is understated but brutal, even though it is off-screen.  There are also great performances in the movie by Angelina Jolie, William Hurt, Eddie Redmayne, and Alec Baldwin (a surprise appearance here!). Michael Gambon, Lee Pace, and Robert de Niro also play pivotal roles.

2751701,2,B000MXPE7Y,"This movie is bad. I'm not sure who to blame, but I think the fault is shared between the director and the writers.

At no point in this movie did I ever care at all about Matt Damon's character. Worse than that, I never found him interesting because he's NOT interesting. My guess is that Damon was trying to act like Alec Guinness doing George Smiley (in the 1970s version of 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy'). But Alec Guinness sitting still and doing nothing was interesting. In this movie, there is exactly one moment where Matt Damon exhibits something that looks like genuine character when he objects to being p*ssed during Skull & Bones initiation mud wrestling. But one of his 'brothers' calms him down and after that he goes back to being a cardboard figure. You want to see Matt Damon being entertaining as a (sort of) spy, watch the wonderful film 'The Informant.'

It must be noted also contrary to what's been said in other reviews that this is NOT a movie about the creation of the CIA. Okay, De Niro (the director) may have thought that was what it was, but the birth of the CIA is a much, much more interesting story than the one told here, and much more nuanced and troubling. I can't think of a good treatment of it in film. I've been reading Ben Macintyre's book 'A Spy Among Friends' which covers some of the same time period but from the perspective of the British and with an emphasis on the Kim Philby scandal. Much, much more interesting story than this movie ever lets on.",1516060800,,1494,4.488970588235294

intelligence. No one is telling you to sleep with person A. What you do is of your own volition.

Other than that, the film is remarkably well made.  Edward, Yale, Skull and Bones, ruins his marriage and relationship with
his son, to serve his country. Edward is a true patriot, however, you have to watch him because in the intelligence business
you trust no one. Edward is a likable character, however, he is passive-aggressive.

2751730,5,B000MXPE7Y,"How could I have missed this one? Beginning with an all star cast, ""The Good Shepherd"" goes way beyond its simple title and cover. The narrative about the life and times of one of the founding members of the CIA plays out in two separate timelines, one beginning at the brink of WWII and the other as the Bay of Pigs invasion plays itself out. The earlier timeline catches up to the secondary at around three quarters into the film and it is done in a way that both work together in a synchronous way, right up to the gripping finish. To sum it up, it is a mixture of U.S. and Soviet intrigue from the very beginning of WWII, on to the start of the Cold War and through to the period of the Cuban Missile Crisis, although it stops just short of that last event. The film may not have a great deal of the violence some younger viewers seem to crave today, but it does contain plenty of other gristle, including covert US and UK partnerships during WWII, the MK-Ultra program, the CIA-Mafia connection (played well by Joe Pesci as usual), CIA and Russian assassinations, the Skull and Bones society, ""old school"" espionage techniques and excellent period reenactments of the private and social lives of the elite in each period.

2751764,5,B000MXPE7Y,"I found the good shepherd to be an interesting movie.  I saw the movie, The Skulls and was very well aware of the secret underground good, old boy society network.  For me the good shepherd was like a continuation of The Skulls.

Matt Damon played Ed Wilson who had a passion for belonging and doing the right thing.  He gets initiated into the skull society and meets a girl that he cares about but she is deaf and does not seem to fit into this world. Then he meets a friends sister played by Angelina Jolie who is aggressive and beautiful but she is not the girl for him.  One day his friend tells Ed that his sister is pregnant. Ed does the right thing and marries her but his heart still yearns for the other girl.

As Ed is learning about the world of government and secrets, he is suspicious of everyone.  Later, in his career he is being given the task to run and develop the CIA. As Ed begins to get older and gets deeper into this world he begins to question his life, his loyalty and the decisions he has made. He realizes that he may have made a grave mistake when his son decides that he wants to pledge and become a part of the CIA and it's underground world.  What does Ed tell his son when he is faced with this dilemma?

Upon research I found that this movie is loosely based upon the lives of a few CIA agents but the premise of the story is true.  In knowing that this is true makes it really scary. Even though we may know about this world and that this type of life exists, to see it in a movie setting can be unsettling.  Please know that a lot of movies such as this, no matter how bizarre, is based on facts and reality. If you want to gain more of an understanding about the CIA, The Skulls or this underground world check out the good shepherd.",1465171200,,1770,4.146198830409356

None of the scenes of the 1920s through the 1960s seem to be of those times.  Although the sets are convincing, the action never seems to be from an earlier era.  For instance, the Harvard musical performance set in the 1930 doesn't seem older than last week's SNL.

De Niro walks through his part.  Matt Damon's portrayal does not convince me he is someone from my grandfather's era.  Apparently Matt Damon doesn't know how to even make the effort.",1461888000,,683,4.720338983050848

2751806,5,B000MXPE7Y,"The CIA had planned an invasion of Cuba using exile forces (housed in Florida) during the Eisenhower Administration. Then Kennedy became president and he believed if the dictator Castro remained in power, communism would spread to other Western Hemisphere nations. From erroneous intelligence, it was thought the invasion would spark a wider uprising or revolt to overthrow the communist regime. So on April 16, 1961, arriving in seven ships, the small exile army of nearly 16 hundred landed on the Bay of Pigs in Cuba. Castro was ready. It was as if he had prior knowledge of the attack. Castro's vastly superior forces killed 114 rebels and quickly captured 12 hundred. Kennedy prohibited American involvement, restricted bombing operations, and refused to authorize air cover for the invasion, because he feared Soviet Premier Khrushchev would retaliate with a counter move against West Berlin. Upon hearing the news of the disastrous failure, Kennedy was furious and fulminated that he would, ""... shatter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter [them] to the winds."" He fired Allen Dulles and two other top officials (Richard Bissell and Charles Cabell) and all CIA overseas personnel was put under State Department control. Kennedy was outraged, understandably, because it made his new administration and the U.S. look inept and imperialistic. The story begins in 1939 when Edward (Matt Damon) was attending Yale University. He met Laura, also a student, whom he would have married if Clover Russell (Angelina Jolie) hadn't interjected herself into his life by seducing him and becoming pregnant. How could he refuse her? She was much more attractive, but you have to feel for Laura, and sadly Edward would have been far happier with Laura (as we see later in the movie). Clover manipulated Edward to please her brother, John Russell Jr., and father, John Russell Sr., a powerful, influential senator. The Russell family had close ties with the establishment (Skull and Bones fraternal organization). The concept of a CIA was in a nascent stage, and someone was needed, with no better credentials than Edward's, to lead the organization. Their plans for Edward came to fruition. In other words, and most irksome, he was railroaded. For the CIA, Edward's role became tantamount to that of J. Edgar Hoover with the FBI.  A central focus of the film is on a tape recorded exchange of information about the planned Cuban invasion before it happened between a white man and a black woman. Information was provided that only a CIA operative could have known. Edward, third in the chain of command with the CIA, was connecting the dots and conducting the investigation of this tape recording. A plethora of clues had been gathered from this recording and also from a surveillance video. Forensic evidence had narrowed the search to a specific location and possible identity of the spy who committed this treasonous act. At the beginning of the movie, all CIA agents were suspect, even Edward. The tension and paranoia and the ponderous toll it was taking on the intelligence officers was vividly portrayed. You get a clear sense of the methodical and meticulous planning involved and the interwoven connectedness of the CIA and KGB. This becomes apparent when Edward's son, also a CIA agent, was entrapped in a relationship with a female KGB spymaster for the purpose of blackmailing Edward. A cunning, Angelina, dazzled with a performance that made this very remarkable film that much better. It's a masterpiece and top ten favorite!",1443398400,16,3536,5.1070811744386875

2751826,2,B000MXPE7Y,"The package arrived on time and in good condition. I have not browsed the extras, but I purchased this primarily for the film.

It's been a long time since I saw this in theaters, when I really enjoyed the story. It's your classic spy-genre set in DC film, starring Matt Damon not so much as an action star but more as a desk pilot, albeit with some surprises. The cinematography is quite beautiful and all the actors did a great job. I was surprised to see Lee Pace in the film on a rewatch, but I didn't know who he was at the time I originally saw this. It goes to show that Pace's best performances are when he isn't playing overly dramatic characters, because I completely bought his performance here, except for the initiation part, which was just disgusting.

Perhaps this movie should serve as a signpost for the bad parts of DC and the CIA and other intelligence agencies in the US. Too much upperclass white boy's club mentality. I found it incredibly difficult to care about anyone in the film, despite the fact that I like most of the actors. Even De Niro did a good job. Now if the film had been about the struggles women have had breaking into the field of espionage, particularly in the time period involved, I think I would have liked it a lot more. But that's not the case. The only female 'spy' is given an incredibly terrible arc told through the lens of the men around her. Racism, sexism, homophobia... Yeah, they were (and still are) around, but the film makes no commentary about them other than that they happened. Reproduction does not equal criticism, and it's disgusting that I'm supposed to feel bad for the emotional struggles of the white male protagonist as he is ""helpless"" to do anything about it, particularly when he's instrumental in punishing the victims. I love that they included Laura's character, a deaf woman with charisma and a sense of humor and that they developed her and didn't just make her a throwaway, but I am far more interested in her story than I am in the main plot of the film. She had a fun relationship with the protagonist. And they did have a homosexual character played by one of my favorite actors, who did an amazing job, as usual. But well... the rest of the film.

My only regret is that the sequels will never be made since it did only mediocre at the box office...but at the end you can tell it was meant to be a continuing saga.  Too bad....we lost a great character and a chance to see him negotiate a fascinating time.  Angelia Jolie is at her best in this film also,1430956800,2,585,3.9913793103448274

2751857,2,B000MXPE7Y,"On paper, The Good Shepherd is a can't miss film. I mean how could you go wrong with a film about the beginnings of the C.I.A., directed by Robert De Niro, and starring multiple Academy Award Winners? I was really excited about finally sitting down to watch this three hour epic, the critics raved about, but sadly, it the case of the Good Shepherd, it was the user reviews that were spot on. Matt Damon portrays one of the C.I.A.'s top agents, a man whose life revolves around his work. The story is based on an investigation into what went wrong during the Bay of Pigs invasion, while at the same time flashing back to how Damon's character got his start in the spy agency. We see everything from his childhood trauma's to his recruitment in college, his actions in World War II, and everything else he did leading up to the Bay of Pigs. Matt Damon was absolutely the perfect choice to play Agent Edward Wilson, as his natural personality was a perfect fit for the characters. If Damon wasn't good enough, he's surrounded by a cast of Hollywood legends that any film would be hard pressed to duplicate, so why the low rating? Even the premise of the film was excellent, but it's downfall is in the story itself. The Good Shepherd is over three hours long and easily feels like it was double that, as the film moves at an absolute snails pace. While the story and the actors were phenomenal, the film itself is done in such a way that it's one long conversation after another, with little if any action in between. Every time an angle is built up, we're sent to the other part of the story and simply have to assume the conclusion, without actually seeing it. The lack of resolution wasn't the only issue, as the film's large cast comes back to haunt it. There are so many people in this movie that are all dressed the same, who all act the same, and who all look the same. I couldn't keep track of who was who. While the Good Shepherd has the makings of an award winning film, the truth is that everyone behind the scenes blew it. This film is much too long, much too slow, and much too confusing to ever be enjoyable, and personally I think it is one of the biggest disappointments to come along in a very long time.",1422144000,,2219,4.375302663438257
2751858,5,B000MXPE7Y,A fantastic look at the CIA and the Cold War.,1420416000,,45,3.6
2751859,1,B000MXPE7Y,"I really wanted to like this movie but after watching it and viewing the credits listing the all-star cast my mind went to Bob Klapisch and John Harpers book about the 1992 New York Mets  The Worst Team Money Could Buy. The actors tried and the subject matter was ripe but the final product was a flop. Robert De Niro as director, like a professional sports coach, should take the shepherds share of the blame. Stick to acting, Mr. De Niro.
 I saw this film a few days after viewing The Gatekeepers, a documentary that greatly enhances understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Matt Damon calls himself a gatekeeper during The Good Shepherd but thats where the similarities end. The Good Shepherd is baaaaaad history!
 Movies like this are increasing cultural illiteracy and damaging our institutions. I recently heard an Episcopalian rector lament that most people of Christian background failed a Facebook-posted test about Christmas because their knowledge is based upon TV and movies, not the reading of scripture. Given this trend, Platos idea of censoring the arts (see The Republic) sounds more and more desirable.
 History is interesting enough. Why do people like De Niro and his script writer, Eric Roth, feel the need and/or audacity to play with it? The European so-called Enlightenment has given these people license to pollute culture. Isnt it time their license be revoked or we find ways of teaching them that with freedom comes responsibility?
 Ian Fleming didn't explicitly write that his fictional James Bond works for the real-world MI-6. That might be inferred but its not on the surface. Why cant De Niro and others follow this standard?
 For the record, De Niro and Roths Edward Wilson (played by Damon) never existed. With his Yale affiliation and amid the backdrop of the real-world Bay of Pigs used in the movie he might be taken for Richard Bissell, a Yalie who headed the clandestine service and had to fall on his sword along with Director Allen Dulles after President Kennedy declined to give air cover to the Cuban insurgents thus ensuring their defeat. Yet Bissell was an economics specialist, not a poetry guy like Wilson. Also, Bissell had a distinguished career elsewhere in government before being brought into CIA. The CIA and making ships in bottles is all Wilson knows.
 William Hurts character (Philip Allen) appears based upon Dulles thanks to a pipe and his juxtaposition to Wilson. Yet Dulles went to Princeton, not Yale, and had a moustache, contrary to Hurts portrayal. Hurts Allen doesnt take the fall for the Bay of Pigs. Hes finally driving from CIA because of his Swiss bank account. Dulles real connection to Switzerland is that while stationed in Bern he played a major role in allied intelligence successes during World War II. Given that, this movie is a further perversion and insult to courageous Americans. One should crack open Great and True Spy Stories (edited by Dulles) instead of wasting time on this garbage movie.
 De Niros character appears based upon CIA founder Wild Bill Donovan but, like everything else, its off. Note the cartoonish burn cylinder on Wilsons desk. Theres also a character patterned on British traitor Kim Philby. Joe Pesci drops in briefly for the best scene but the film is too far gone by then.
 Another canard is making CIA look like a subsidiary of Yales Skull and Bones society. Responding to President Nixons contention that CIA is full of Ivy League liberals that always opposed him politically, then-CIA Director Richard Helms (a non-Ivy Leaguer -- Williams College, Class of 1935) found that Ivy League graduates are not in greater concentration in CIA than in other U.S. government agencies.
 HmmmDe Niro and Nixon have similar emotionalism when it comes to CIA. Now that would make a much more interesting movie than the bilge that is The Good Shepherd.",1420416000,2,3859,4.978260869565218

2751867,5,B000MXPE7Y,"I admit that I was curious to watch the Good Shepherd after reading online that it was affiliated with the idea of a secret society (such as the mention of Skull & Bones,  and Im guessing hidden references to others such as Illuminati etc.). Anyhow Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie, and Robert De Niro are among the famous people that star in the movie.  Matt Damon plays a CIA agent named Edward who puts a lot of himself into his job, but must keep a lot of what he does secret from his wife (played by Angelina Jolie). However, the tragic part is that  Edward does not care that much about having to leave his wife and son alone for months on end due to the fact that he only married her because he was expected to do the right thing after she became pregnant.  However, I understand that he (Matt Damon) is only skillfully playing a character (Edward) of one who is a CIA man of his time. Needless to say, the son loves his father but his closer to his mother a lot more. The character of Edward finds out the hard way (through the actions of his son) that there is a price to pay for the life he agreed to live and the secret society pact he is part of. Alec Baldwin, Billy Crudup, William Hurt, Timothy Hutton, and John Tuturro are also listed to be a part of the movie.",1418342400,,1270,4.192622950819672
2751868,4,B000MXPE7Y,This is an awfully well threaded plot with good subplots and it's nice to see Jolie play a part of someone her own age. She was way too old for the pregnant girlfriend part. I loved the intrigue of meetings with the Russian counterpart to Matt Damon's role.,1417996800,,257,4.375
2751869,4,B000MXPE7Y,This is a class 10 Movie for content and quality. Its well written and photographed,1417824000,,83,4.6
2751870,3,B000MXPE7Y,"This is a much more ambitious movie than ""A Bronx Tale,"" De Niro's first directorial effort, but it's less successful.  It tries to combine the history of the early days of the CIA (arising out of the Office of Strategic Services in WW2) with the story of a man losing his soul in the course of devoting himself to keeping his country safe.  It's a movie in which another character says to that man, ""Get out before you lose your soul"" -- so there's a degree of explicitness in the writing that works against the drama to some extent.  Trust the viewer, I wanted to say.  If you can show, there's no need to tell.  The man whose soul is in danger is Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), recruited to the OSS out of Yale, a member of Skull and Bones, the Yale secret society (made to seem awfully silly here) and therefore, we're to suppose, a man capable of keeping secrets.  He also seems temperamentally to be made for secrecy; maybe because his father killed himself, he has become reticent quite apart from Skull and Bones.  As the story goes on, the question of which of his colleagues can be trusted is constantly brought up (more over-explicitness), and he doesn't share what he does with his family, and (not really a spoiler) he does in a sense lose his soul, although his honor remains intact.

Part of the trouble with the movie is its jumps back and forth in time and place.  Its ""present"" is the time of the ill-fated Bay of Pigs operation (1961), but the movie jumps back as early as 1939 to Edward's initiation into Skull and Bones"" and then to the places in Europe during and after the war, and then back to the States after the war but prior to the Kennedy election.  This gives us the opportunity to see the gradual dissolution of his family life (which was initiated after a single sexual encounter with the sister of a Yale classmate [Angelina Jolie]  that results in a pregnancy).  The couple don't know one another, and Edward is posted abroad a week after the wedding.  He doesn't love Margaret (Jolie's character), but he has ""done the right thing.""  In doing so, he has given up an attractive and spirited hearing-impaired girlfriend with whom he was much more compatible.  As a father, he is kind and well-meaning, but distant both emotionally and geographically.  Then as time goes on, his son goes to Yale, and then wants to join the CIA too . . . What could possibly go wrong?

Edward lives in a world of spies, defectors, infiltrators, and bureaucrats, and he does indeed come to trust no one.  The emotional tone of the film is almost uniformly reined in and depressive -- as if Edward is aware of the costs to himself and his family, but is sucking it up anyway.  Damon is a good actor, but you only have to think of Pacino's reined-in performance in ""Godfather 2"" to see that there isn't anything like the same tension.  It gets dull, and dull is dull whether you're in Washington, Berlin, London, or Leopoldville.  There's a consistency and integrity to the performance, but it isn't gripping or engaging.  Jolie's moony Margaret, who seems to come close to slipping into alcoholism doesn't lighten the atmosphere.  Her initial scene where she pretty much rapes Edward has some energy, but it's all downhill after that.  Not surprisingly, then, it's actors in smaller vivid parts who make the most lasting impression: Michael Gambon is an unctuous Yale professor who might be a spy; Joe Pesci is a mobster that Edward tries to enlist for the Cuba fiasco.  William Hurt is effective as Edward's first boss at the agency -- did he, one asks, have a soul to lose?  John Turturro has a painful torture scene; Tammy Blanchard as the hearing-impaired girl is attractive and open.

There's too much jumping around in time and place, but the pieces do fit together in retrospect (time and place changes are noted in on-screen letters).  The rhythm and pacing are problems however, and merely fitting isn't enough.  Visually, the movie is efficient but not arresting. (It didn't help that I saw ""Amarcord"" right before.)  The acting is professional (De Niro is the guy who dreams up the CIA, but he doesn't make a strong impression in a small role).  And it's long . . . .  A movie with a spy story that works better and also involves recruiting and flashbacks is the Redford/Pitt ""Spy Game"" from 2001.  It's a less ambitious movie and aims to entertain, but it holds your attention, with all its genre elements, better than this one.  So, to sum up -- it's certainly OK and clearly well thought-out, but it doesn't quite come alive on the screen.",1417132800,,4563,4.5995055624227446

He meets his Soviet nemesis, Ulysses, with whom he and his CIA team will match wits in global espionage as his personal and professional lives become inter-twined despite his best efforts to keep them clinically separate.

It's great because it feels like looking over a spies shoulder while he works. You have to pay attention because everything is a secret. Its easy to miss things.
Amazing cast. Jolie annoys me. Personal preference. It's written like H.P. Lovecraft would with respect to real events and the causes of the events. So that's pretty cool. Fictional causes to things that actually happened. Damon is a total hard ass. He is a great agent because he is a master of having dirt on other people. You'll have to find out if anyone has dirt on him.

I'm not talking just James Bond movies, but movies as maudlin and depressing as director Martin Ritt's THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD. But if I thought THAT was a downer, this Robert DeNiro-directed historical spy epic goes to the top of the list of downright depressing. When your main character shows all the emotion of a dead mackerel, you know you're in trouble. I GET IT that that's the way the character was written, but if you're going to sit through 2 1/2 hours of this... Anyway, I appreciated the espionage tidbits in this film, but at the same time I realize this is a very Left-wing liberal look at the CIA. DeNiro seems to go out of his way to constantly hammer us with how ruthless the OSS and later, the CIA were, without anything favorable about the organizations. I think this does disservice to all the men and women, who remain nameless, gave their lives in the service of this country, like it or not.

I can't add anything more than previous reviewers have already said, except to criticize those who questioned Damon's character's ability to ignore his wife, played by the beautiful Angelina Jolie. Of course he could. She trapped him into a loveless marriage and took him away from someone he truly loved, a girl who was authentic and with whom he had established a deep bond. The emptiness of the marriage, his dedication to duty, both towards his family and his country,  pushed him further inward and made him a grim amoral bureaucrat in his mature years. There is a scene where he is united with his old love ( who I actually find much prettier and fresher than Jolie)  where she describes what could have been --'We would have married and you would have been a professor in a college town, publishing your poetry.' I found it poignant, tragic and very moving--a completely unlived life.",1361836800,,959,4.806060606060606

2751958,5,B000MXPE7Y,"This movie never ceases to amaze me. The purpose of acting is to emote. Damon's character has to suppress all emotion, for over 2 hours on screen.

This is the story of a highly damaged man who finds his niche as a counter intelligence agent at the outbreak of WWII with the OSS (precursor to the CIA) recruited out of college about 1940, and follows his life through middle age.

I find it hard to say he's ruthless, as his character never appears ambitious. Because he feels nothing, he is able to do whatever is asked of him, including arranging several murders.

The character is much like La Carre's 'grey man' Smiley, without the intellect, as he never questions what is asked of him.",1347235200,,690,4.548387096774194

These thoughts were going through my head when I was on Amazon considering buying this version...I mean even though it says it's Region A, it still may not play on a blu-ray player here in the US.  Well, I decided to take the chance and I can tell you it definitely works here in the US.  There are two audio versions...one is foriegn...I think French or Dutch...the other is the original audio in English 5.1 DTS surround sound.  The only down side (and this is trivial) is that there are no English subtitles.  I only say this because I'm a little hard of hearing, so I like to watch movies with the subtitles on.  It always seems there are a few spots in the movie where I can't really tell what the characters are saying and the subtitles keep me from having to rewind to hear it again.  Other than this, this version of the movie is great...perfect picture and perfect sound, not to mention the the movie itself is great.

2751962,2,B000MXPE7Y,"OK, we know Matt Damon knows how to play a spy: dead-pan, giving nothing away on his face. But this one is without all the judo and guns. This is a spy who does it all with thinking. Does not make for a very big action-type story, but it is interesting.

Edward Wilson is a member of Skull & Bones, and we get some inside information on what that's like -- assuming it's accurate, which how would I know? Let's just say that what I do know of secret societies in general, it seems authentic. So that's the first thing that puts him in line, on the insiders' network for espionage work during WWII, in the OSS. Once the war is over and they realize they are going to need spies in the face-off with the Soviets, he is recruited for a major role (apparently number three man) in the CIA.

After that, the plot gets very, very complicated. He learned early on that there is no one he can trust, and that becomes more and more true the longer he is involved. Unfortunately, his son grows up to want to be a CIA man, too. And that is really why the plot is so darn complicated.

I'm not going to spoil it for you. I can't anyway; I didn't understand half of what went on. I will need to see it another couple of times to figure it all out. But I wonder if I will bother. Frankly, it was disappointing.",1337385600,,1296,4.134920634920635

2751966,4,B000MXPE7Y,"I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this film, mainly because it received such a cold shoulder from critics and awards bodies alike, despite the fact that it has such a high pedigree and the subject matter is beyond baity.  Still, I wanted to see it and so I indulged my curiosity the other night to a rather surprising effect.

I expected to be bored stiff and or unengaged and what I found was a much tighter and much more involved film than I expected.

That isn't to say it isn't without flaws, but it certainly isn't without merit either.

`The Good Shepherd' tells the story of one of the CIA's founding fathers, Edward Wilson.  Wilson is a sharp young man who is corralled into a very different and guarded lifestyle after being inducted into the CIA.  The timeframe of the film spans from 1939, where Wilson becomes a member of the Skull and Bones, all the way to 1961, where the Bay of Pigs plays a pivotal role in Wilson's overall development.  Taking his time to flesh out certain aspects of Wilson's life, Director Robert DeNiro (yes, THAT Robert DeNiro) allows us to come to know who this man was, even if the guarded nature of his persona makes him appear a mystery most times.  I loved the progressive nature of the film and the way that the film was so sharply edited to find a sense of tension amidst a rather cold and slow moving premise (yes, this film is void of any real action).  Still, one feels the overwhelming intensity that accompanies such a complicated lifestyle.

To all that I admired, I would be amiss if I didn't criticize the film in parts.  For starters, Angelina Jolie is completely miscast here and truly squanders her talent.  I mean, she brings NOTHING to the table and seems completely awkward in every scene she's in.  I also found the big reveal surrounding Wilson's father to be anticlimactic and underwhelming.  I loved the angle revolving around The Bay of Pigs and Wilson's connection, and I felt that the film's finale was expertly played (if not a tad soap operatic in tone), but the emotional connection one was supposed to make between Wilson's actions and those of his father aren't as impactful as I would have wanted.

There is a balance necessary in order to make a film's cold nature feel relatable, and little touches are needed to bring us there.  `The Good Shepherd' is far more engaging than some will suggest, but it lacks those touches to make it feel poignant to the audience.

Still, I highly recommend seeing this; even though I understand why most won't like it.",1326067200,2,2527,4.5924276169265035

I was pleading telepathically for Matt Damon's character to morph into Jason Bourne and start slapping people to wake up out of their comatose-like acting. Despite heavy hitters such as Angelina Jolie's lips, William Hurt's wig and Alec Baldwin's gut showing up to gain screen time, apparently Robert De Niro was too lazy to actually lift himself from a chair during two scenes in this movie.

A complete mess at attempting to ""explain"" the CIA's rise in a movie. maybe it does depict accurately how the CIA started, works and goes about its business. All I can say on celluloid it's not worthy of watching unless you enjoy paint drying while waiting for a bus that never comes.

2751972,2,B000MXPE7Y,"""The Good Shepherd"" seems to refer to the CIA, as a Christ-like agency that watches over his sheep.  Matt Damon plays a CIA agent, with flashbacks of his life.  Most of the action is set in the 1960's, however, the film hops back and forth in time.  The first flashback is his father's suicide and him hiding the suicide note, taking the blame for accidently killing his father.  He did not want his mother to know his father took his own life.  The movie meanders through his life and loves, with little emotional punch or interest.  After watching about thirty minutes, you realize it is not a thriller, or even very interesting.  The whole movie runs about three hours and is just boring, complicated and amazing that a man can go through life with his mouth shut, yet realizing you cannot ""erase"" mistakes, and mistakes can be big.  Top-rate actors like Damon, DeNiro, Jolie, and many others promise a epic film, but somehow there is no interesing hook.  The ending shows Matt reading his father's suicide note, as he kept and hid it for decades.  Even that ending was not satisfying.  The movie wants to relay a deep and important story, but it can't find the keynote to make this leap.",1299456000,2,1191,4.597156398104265
2751973,3,B000MXPE7Y,"'The Good Shepherd' is one of those films that could have offered so much more, and sadly didn't. The cast was good, the direction was good, the story was good and yet nothing seemed to gel and you're left feeling strangely dissatisfied with everything. The story is very slow paced and although I can normally enjoy films of this type, I found this to be quite a laboured affair. Set against the backdrop of WW2 and the bay of pigs fiasco this story has some great historical touches and added some authenticity to the plot-line. I found it very strange how Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie seemed to age very little as the film progressed, especially with Damon looking the same at the start as at the end which is supposed to be 22 years later! At least they gave Jolie bags under her eyes, but that was about it. There were some excellent cameo appearances from the likes of Joe Pesci and the few scenes with De Niro were very good. Overall, if you like espionage type films, but without the thrills and action, then this is the film for you, otherwise you can safely give this a miss and not worry in the slightest.

2751974,5,B000MXPE7Y,"This movie was by no means an action movie. It was not what I would categorize as a drama, although there it is certainly a tragedy. Although there is tragedy in the movie, contrary to impulse the movie is rather intentionally muted on the emotional level. I suspect that this was on purpose, perhaps to give the viewer an idea of the emotional sacrifices necessary when serving in clandestine services.

For many the main character's apparent apathy is a turn off. However, again this speaks to the purpose of the film. It shows the features needed in a member of secretive services, that is quite contemplation and calm mind. In fact, one might say that only people with this type of mind would be able to enjoy this movie. But I digress and propose that unfortunately many will not be able to appreciate the movie's value. It is indeed very cerebral.

So what is the movie about? Sacrifice in the name of patriotism. If you patiently watch this movie and consider what would be necessary to make such a contribution to one's country you will be able to appreciate what kind of life those lead in the actual spy world. In the real world it is not all the dramatic action as seen in the 007 movies. Consider that by definition most secret operations are meant to be kept quite. If such operators went around blowing things up and behaving in said manner nothing would be kept quite. That being said this movie is a better representation for those wanting to know what secret service is all about.

All in all I must say I love this movie. For me, it was amazing. But then again I've always had the type of mind that is suspicious, contemplative, loves detail and complication. So for those of you who are more prone to enjoy the simple things in life and detest complicated matters, you may want to avoid this movie as you'll likely find it long and boring (which it is indeed fairly long - about 2.75hrs).",1294790400,,1907,4.521739130434782

This one for the highly prolific actor is only his second credit as a director, the first ""A Bronx Tale"" was small but still highly watchable.  Francis Ford Copolla is one of the producers and this comes closed of being The Godfather as CIA boss.  Matt Damon who's in every scene, underplays everything which adds both to a slower pace and others to act out more.

In spite of billing, John Turturro is Damon's true co-star here, having a standout scene in an interrogative sequence with Russian spy. Angelina  Jolie is quite bewitching at the beginning and acts old well as narrative takes place in twenty years, from the outbreak of World War Two to the Bay of Pigs.  Mr. DeNiro's scenes are quite brief and he even gives old co-star Joe Pesci one great scene.

The real focus though is that of a spy thriller, different than the Jason Bourne movies that Damon has done.  I did enjoy the intrigue and how William Hurt's character gets put down.

I admit I could be called less than objective because I love Matt Damon and would see just about ANY movie he comes out with these days. People want to call it disconnected but this is emblematic of the intelligence  community. I found no fault in the story telling or the awesome cast that powered it. I found it creepy and was inclined to look around twice as I left the theater to make sure no-one was tailing me. It's the surgical, methodical cold blooded nature of Matt Damon's character that becomes a definitive trademark and one I can identify with as I aspire to it myself. If I had but ONE complaint, I would say that Angelina Jolie's role in this movie is woefully underdone but other than that, I found it excellent storytelling.",1276300800,,1009,4.574585635359116
2751978,5,B000MXPE7Y,"This is one of those films about which people feel very strongly, positive or negative:  it does not fit into an easy category (e.g. Bond-like action), has extraordinary nuance that speaks to very specific interests (bureaucratic power, the private life of spies, civilian control over dirty tricks, elite secret societies), and has wonderfully understated acting that hides what is going on underneath more than acts it out.  If it isn't for everyone, I found it utterly fascinating and engaging all the way through.

The plot revolves around a group initiated into Yale's Skull & Bones club, the elite of the elite who gain connections that will benefit them for the rest of their lives after they are ""chosen"" and submit to bizarre rituals.  In the mid-1930s, they were white, from privileged WASP families from the NE, and naively patriotic (e.g. George HW Bush).  While fitting in, Damon's character has subtle problems:  son of a suicide who was apparently corrupt and perhaps even a traitor, deeply troubled in his relationships, and deeply secretive to protect his innermost feelings.  Taken into the OSS and married after an almost accidental sexual encounter, he grows into a master spy at the moment that his Skull & Bones ""brothers"" are founding the CIA.  He becomes one of their early top officials.

The viewer enters into the spy's world view, not as dashing swashbucklers, but as the ultimate manipulators of events and opinions from bureaucratic perches in depressingly plain offices.  Their mission is to protect American security, but their activities define their purview in a far wider way than merely military.  Even the architect behind it (de Niro) has misgivings, which the younger ""brothers"" apparently do not.  In many ways, they begin to be corrupted by their power, which they love yet are not overt about it.  It is a wonderful study of how a professional bureaucracy evolves into ever new areas.  The violence, which underpins everything they are managing, makes only a few brief appearances, which are frighteningly realistic, subdued yet sudden.  Trusting no one, through Damon you see how it impacts their private lives.

The Damon character, who had great potential to grow in a very different direction, becomes completely consumed by his duty and subtle lust for power as he masses evidence on his own colleagues as well.  His wife, a great beauty from a Skull & Bones family (Jolie in an unusually subtle role that matches her talents), suffers terribly from his mission-driven egotism, as does his son; they live with constant fear and dread.  In a way, he self-destructs, but at the same time he is an extraordinary achiever and, in my view, a completely believable psychological profile:  he was working to please an absent parent, was driven by his sense of class and purpose, and had extreme talent.  But all of this is revealed in ways that must be interpreted, a layer below his gloomy, dutiful surface, which is great fun if you like to let characters like this enter your imagination.

The plot is also wonderfully complex, if somewhat confusing with all the skips in time.  It is based around the failure of the Bay of Pigs fiasco.  A seeming friend, his Soviet counterpart is seeking ways to undermine and co-opt him:  his efforts are yet another way that complicates the Damon character's life, with terrible consequences that once again are not completely spelled out.  Did he follow the route of his father?  Somewhat less?  Can you become partially corrupt?  Or did he betray the last things he held dear for the sake of his career and integrity?  There are no clear answers to these questions, but if the film has spoken to you, you formulate your own answers.  This is filmmaking, in my view, at its absolute best.

Recommended as a masterpiece.  All the details are as delicious as they are deliberate.  The acting is first rate, understated, and rich in ambiguity.",1275264000,,3921,4.946483180428134

Good acting, good directing, good writing. But don't take mine or anyone else's word for it; I ask you to read some intelligence literature, both internal company memos and bios of agents as well as critical analysis by scholars, journalists, and historians and you we sill this movie is highly realistic and accurate.

Because the genre that the movie is in is relatively weak (espionage,political thriller) this is a 5-star movie, but as as a drama or thriller its a 4 star.

Not once did I care about any of the characters, which is critical to the success of this film.  They all seemed to be moving underwater, which is a good analogy to describe the pace of the film.  Intellectually, I got the point of what the characters did, why they did it, and the gut-wrenching nature of their actions, but it never hit me in the gut.

Matt Damon was superb as usual (makes you wonder how he and Ben Affleck ever ended up as friends!). Not much for Angelina Jolie to do here, except pout her already too-pouty lips - her role was horribly underwritten or, perhaps, better suited for a lesser voluptuous luminary. I got what the writer was trying to say. It just took too long to say it! Whenever the action (which was in short supply) lost my attention, I spent most of my time trying to figure out how does a person living in a house which appears to be in upper Northwest Washington, take a bus labeled ""12th & Pennsylvania Ave"", pass right by that stop which is technically the end of the line, travel several blocks south, cross over the Potomac River via the 14th St. Bridge towards Virginia (you can see the Jefferson Memorial on the right), then double back to mile to end up in McLean, VA at the CIA - WITHOUT EVER GETTING OFF OF THE BUS TO TRANSFER!! I was born and raised in DC back in the old days before the Metro subway system, riding buses all over town, so that bus route kinda bafflee me. Even if the CIA was housed someplace else back then, the 12th & Penn bus has NEVER passed the Jefferson Memorial!

Another reviewer recommended ""The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"". Excellent film, although I have not seen it in years. I was sorely disappointed with this film. As one reviewer remarked, 'too dark'. I agree. The film strings together some of the history associated with the CIA/OSS. Damon's character appears to be loosely based on James Jesus Angleton, head of CI for 20 years. The back and forth nature of the film from WWII to 1961, then to post WWII, then to 1961, etc does nothing to enhance the film. For any viewer who hasn't read anything on the CIA or the cold war, I think it would be difficult to follow.

It's not that they did not want to develop a character in a story, it shows the real world consequences of basically leading a double life.

But worse than that is the amateurish script.  Each scene lasts about fifteen seconds before moving onto the next--often unrelated--scene.

One is a scene where someone is wearing one of the infamous hoods from the Abu Gharib tortures, this is supposed to be 1959 or 1960, so, the message here is that this type of thing has been common since then.

Interesting things include the development of the character played by Damon through the beginnings with WWII and the relationship with the spy networks in England.

With a running time of close to three hours, the story inevitably bogs down and gets in its own way; but that's about as much badmouthing I'm going to give a movie I enjoyed as much as this one.

Depicting a promising young Yale grad picked by Army intelligence to work behind the lines during World War II, then tapped on the shoulder to help found what became the CIA, Matt Damon is absolutely riveting.  His character, Edward Wilson, sacrifices everything--his personal life, his family--for espionage, intelligence, and counter-intelligence, as America enters the Cold War.  Damon is stoic, devoid of emotion, soft spoken, unflappable--cold and heartless.  Nothing seems to move him--even when his own son hangs in the balance.  The events surrounding him--the Second World War, the Cold War, the Bay of Pigs, his son's ill-advised contacts with CIA targets--are spellbinding.

And you can't go wrong with Damon's supporting cast, including De Niro himself, William Hurt, and Alec Baldwin, just to name a few.  John Turturro plays an effective, sometimes brutal, assistant to Damon's Wilson, yet unfortunately, Angelina Jolie is utterly wasted (pardon the pun) in a reduced role as the neglected, drunken wife.  THE GOOD SHEPHERD is well worth the lengthy viewing; just make sure you have plenty of time to appreciate what it brings to the table.

2751996,5,B000MXPE7Y,"The Good Shepherd is easily one of the best spy films ever made. It's got brilliant (and understated) acting, perfectly paced direction, and excellent use of (a very cold) tone running throughout it. It's also an excellent story using human drama (much like John Le Carre) to move the various scenes forward.....in short a great movie given lack-luster DVD treatment.

The DVD itself has ""16 minutes"" of deleted scenes and...well..that's it. No ""making of"", no interview with the cast, no story-boards, NOTHING. This is a huge shame mostly because the film itself turned alot of people off with it's dense plot and cold characters and I think a commentary or ""making of"" would've been the best thing to help people along. This could've opened the movie's fan-base and given people a new respect for it. Again, this is a totally missed opportunity.

I'm still giving this DVD 5-stars because the film's just that good. The picture quality is great and if you're a fan of this movie while it was in theaters you'll love revisiting it.",1232409600,,1032,4.857954545454546
2751997,4,B000MXPE7Y,"I'm still not sure what happens at the conclusion here. And it is, after all, more than 2.5 hours long, an eternity by today's movie standards. Matt Damon is a little less than convincing as the cold warrior, but this gathers steam, overall, and I did manage to watch it all at one sitting, which is saying something for a long movie. Even Angelina Jolie isn't bad as the neglected wife who just wants to have fun. Flawed, but not a throw-away either.",1232236800,,451,4.445783132530121

Everyone I was watching it with (party of 12) fell asleep at some point. Now I know that you may suggest that it may have been only interesting for certain audiences, but we are all avid fans of SPY films and we all know great knowledge of the World Wars, so clearly they did something wrong! Robert De Niro's debut directing effort sucked! He needs to stick to acting. I heard he will be directing 2 sequels for the film, all i can say is...don't WASTE YOUR TIME! You will crash and burn in hollywood, once again buddy! So yes, don't waste your money/three hours of your life you could spend with family and friends on this poor poor attempt at entertainment. You could however, check out a better film like the Dark Knight or listen to a Leona Lewis CD. Good luck in all your endeavors, Robert, but please don't make any more films, because frankly they are abominations and atrocious reels of film!

It's entirely possible to do a movie about an unlikable and even bland character that makes him interesting and sympathetic. In this character study the creation of an even mildly compelling character whose life we take any real interest in was simply not accomplished. This isn't to say Matt Damon did not act well because he seems to have turned in a decent, understated performace that was befitting of the role. The fact that this is a story about a strange man whose life is his work that is also the story of the birth of the CIA lumps it together with a whole slew of movies that affect for the worse my reaction to this espionage, cold war spy drama. Seems like it could have been a lot more engaging to me, and no I don't mean more action. THE GOOD SHEPHERD is an odd film.",1227484800,3,936,4.23463687150838

But it's not clear from either the product description  or the reviews if a) there's any director or actor commentaries on the film; b) any making-of featurettes; or c) any documenatries about the real CIA or historical figures, such as James Angleton, upon whom the movie is based.
  Since there's no mention of any of that in the product description, I assume there's no commentary track or other features. Is that correct?",1227484800,,548,4.808510638297872

I can only imagine that in this dumbed-down age of limited attention spans, anything that challenges the intellect is regarded as 'uncool'. Some reviewers say that the characters are under-developed, while others say that De Niro has taken on too much. This is utter nonsense. The movie is superb, the casting is superb, the acting is superb, and the story is superb. It is, in other words, a masterpiece.",1224633600,,508,4.9186046511627906
2752002,5,B000MXPE7Y,"That this film has only an aggregate 3 stars is yet further proof that there are a lot of ""stringer"" spooks ""out there"" that post at these sites, policing us and our film opinions to make sure that we are steered away from such a superb and impressive movie, a film easily as good as anything John Le Carre brought to the screen, and most know how he is highly regarded as the novelist of record for such ""spycraft.""  This film is every bit as good as anything he's done, high praise since he is so superbly nuanced, and it's a great introduction to the historical character of James Jesus Angleton, whose life ""The Good Shepherd"" uses as its model, though not exclusively.  Many details of his life are closely reprised, though.

Though not that surprised, I was impressed that director and creator Bobby DeNiro had the chops, depth, and intellect to come up with such a compelling history of what's what at Langley.  The roll-up at the end included a note that he intends a sequel, and I can't wait to see what he has planned, since all signs would point to it having some of the most important suggestions about all the rest of the ""what's what"" in our current day, with this blundering behemoth known as CIA ( note that the main compound there now is named ""The George H. W. Bush Center for Intelligence"" if you any more need persuading as to the oxymoronic nature of that Beast ~~ Bubba gave the dedicatory speech in fawning adulation of Poppy, and you can see that treacle if you go to ""our"" country's ""intelligence"" agency website, archived in their press releases from the end of the Millennium.)

Though by nature the film will arouse a certain controversy, it is anything but boring, rather riveting, and certainly should be at the top of anybody's DVD list. ( If you combine its insights with a film that is inescapably related, ""The Good German"" with Clooney, you'll see why Keith Olbermann recently tagged one of his recent stories ""The Good German Shepherd,"" as a little levity poked at the peccadillos involved in each. )

Ever since the fascination that's developed out of ""The Quiet American"" of 2002, with Michael Caine in a stellar portrayal, and please read the background story on this by professor H. Bruce Franklin in The Nation, which you can find by googling ""By the Bombs Early Light,"" a reprint of that review, there's been a sharper popular focus on the betrayals of the American people by our own intelligence community.  Graham Greene was on to the whole thing, and the disaster known as ""CIA,"" way back when, since the getgo when he covered it in his unknown role as British Intelligence officer.

All in all, this movie is a crowning achievement for DeNiro, who plays the old OSS boss William Donovan, renamed here S""ullavan"" for the sake of ""covert"" courtesy.  Seeing it will give you the flavor and feel of James Jesus Angleton, and others, who put their indelible stamp on the Agency and gave it the DNA that all Americans should hope to re-engineer into something less of a mutation, and more of a service. Much like ""Gangs of New York,"" this film gives an accurate sense of history through a collage of several characters mixed into one, an effect I'd call ""Historical Surrealism,"" since the truth is retained even though certain facts and events are mingled. The truth is distilled out of many into one, so that the fiction can be even more relevant, even in ways more accurate, than the sometimes more pedestrian realities. Many traits or qualities are fused into a single synecdoche.

The flaws of the agency as it now stands could easily bring down the country, from the inside, from our heavily spy-infiltrated electronic elections, all the way to a near complete ignorance of foreign languages, when compared to foreign intelligence agencies, thus putting us at great disadvantage with their powers.

That's just for starters, and all the damage that CIA has done as ""premier"" of the National Security State inaugurated by Harry Truman ( naming the first chief of CIA, Souers, out of St. Louis, Mo., and his vast intelligence experience running Piggly Wiggly supermarkets) merely at home, in its massaging of our domestic agencies with bad and covert BS, is only a drop in the ocean of wrong and woe it has done to others around the world, with assassinations and propped up petty tyrants, just to name two chronic pranks its famous for.  Often their best defense has been our own ineptitude, and John Perkins explores much of the insider's viewpoint on this in ""Confessions of an Economic Hitman.""

See the film, and learn of the lameness, your children will thank you.  Damon is surprisingly terrific, too, and all in all superbly directed, acted, scored, filmed.  Top marks.",1223769600,2,4720,4.739024390243903
2752003,4,B000MXPE7Y,"This is a well made film, unfortunately overlooked despite its star ensemble cast and production. Clocking in at 168 minutes, it probably would have made a better mini series.  Robert DeNiro does a great job directing this.  However the casting of Matt Damon as a man who gives his life up for the CIA was perhaps not the most inspired choice.  I agree it's hard to empathise with him, but I saw that as the limitations of Matt Damon's acting abilities.  Taciturn and not particularly expressive, Matt Damon also hardly ages much across the decades that this film spans - he's too constant and thus never progresses as a character.

Nonetheless, the movie is engaging - even though it could have benefitted from more tension.  As it is, the DVD's deleted scenes reveal entire sequences that would've made the movie even longer.  Given the film's multiple subplots, leaving these scenes out didn't hurt.  To sum up, The Good Shepherd plays/ reads like a book, and for those confused about the plot...watch it with subtitles.  The ensemble cast makes it worthwhile - Angelina Jolie does a great job as does William Hurt, John Turturro, Alec Baldwin, and everyone else.

DeNiro may have been trying to channel his Cold War version of the Godfather here, but this is a slow burn and Damon is no Pacino.  Still, a sterling movie and monumental effort from a screen legend.",1223769600,,1367,4.774468085106383
2752004,4,B000MXPE7Y,"I would guess I'm not the only person to have trouble sorting out the twists and turns of a spy film's plot - the layers of betrayal, to be convincing enough to keep even veteran spies plausibly in doubt, have to be very confusing. As such, the morning after, I've got these questions.

1) Is William Hurt's Phil Allen character, apparently based loosely on Allen Dulles, guilty of embezzling money? guilty of taking money from the Soviets? or merely guilty of financial indiscretions which make him susceptible to blackmail? Dulles' financial issues are an interesting footnote to history - that he and his brother as lawyers represented American firms deeply invested in Germany after World War I and remaining so in Nazi Germany but with several layers of financial secrecy through Swiss banks and business fronts - but there has been no suggestions that his loyalty was compromised.

2)Who is Ulysses? Is he a KGB spymaster, or a highly placed KGB spy in the Western spy apparatus?

3)Getting away from plot to character for a moment, Angelina Jolie's character, Wilson's wife Clover/Margaret, rings untrue in one way. She meets him as a wild, beautiful, rich girl. She's seemingly luring him into a sexual liaison because she's expected to find a husband from the right social class and feels pressed to do so with the war threatening to take most eligible men away. I have trouble translating her into the unhappy, drunk, passive wife and mother that lives uncomfortably with him for another 15 years after the war. Far more likely is the suggestion dangled early on when Wilson calls on the phone from occupied Berlin and hears his young son let slip that she's going out with someone, planting the suspicion in his mind that she's being unfaithful, and he retaliates by allowing himself to be drawn into a fling with his translator. The plot uses this to show that this was a onetime thing on her part, and meanwhile Wilson himself allows himself to be compromised when the translator turns out to be a Russian spy. But I would find it more convincing to believe that Clover isn't a girl to suffer the lack of male company for very long, and to have left him for another man by the war's end. I also can't see where the wild girl disappears to. This is unconvincing.

4)I didn't realize until late in the movie that Wilson's Russian counterpart was not, himself, the (fake) defector. I'm not too good with faces. But I thought that was the basis for Wilson's trust in the defector.

5)With the rapid crosscutting between scenes and time periods, and little change in Wilson's appearance to help signal the changes, I was initially confused over the thread - a hair? a violin string? an antenna? - found in the book, was found on his own desk or that of the (fake) defector whom Wilson in the adjoining scenes is confronting in the man's home late one night.

6)I had some trouble separating out the fellow Bonesmen - the guy who talks Wilson into staying in Bones following the humiliating initiation scene and who Wilson follows up the ranks at the CIA, vs. Clover's brother who is killed in World War II, vs. the Senator (her father?), etc.

7)Wilson's ethnic remark to Pesci's character, seemingly meant to be emblematic of WASP bigotry, isn't convincing. Pesci's Joey Prima mobster character is in Wilson's face a bit, busting his balls about his ethnicity. I just see the usually buttoned up Wilson letting loose for a moment to give it right back to him. The scene is still worthwhile dramatically, though, as Wilson gets to witness the close-knit nature of Prima's family, as Prima bickers with his daughter about taking good care of his grandchildren at the beach.

8)At Yale, the word was that it was Scroll and Key, not Skull and Bones, that had the inside track at the State Department and the CIA.

9)Some reviewers see Turturro's character as brutal. Only in one scene is he portrayed as slapping around someone during an interrogation, and the stakes are pretty high when he does. There is no groundwork to suggest that he has a brutal streak in his nature. I find his character's most important function as to highlight the unfair ethnic-class structure at the time. The character is older than Wilson at the outset and also a college graduate, but merely a noncom because he's Catholic and Italian.

There were tons I loved about this movie. Its examination of the conflicting loyalties to country, family, school, secret society and job, and the toll this takes over a lifetime, is formidable. I think its period scenes of 1930s Yale and the Skull and Bones milieu are excellent. I think, however, that the book ""The Company"" (more than the TV miniseries based on it)does a better job covering the same material with the same themes while rendering it far less confusing.

My questions about this are not a reflection of the film's flaws, rather of my own obtuseness and the film's subtlety. I probably need to watch it again.",1221696000,3,4951,4.758741258741258
2752005,4,B000MXPE7Y,"Well, let's get the weaknesses of this film out of the way first. Matt Damon (playing the lead role of Wilson), while likely cast for his ability to bring a silent, brooding, inscrutable intensity to his roles (which this lead role requires), is not really a good fit--too boyish in his looks, not enough gravitas to be playing someone as powerful as a CIA head guy, even one in his early years. I just didn't buy him in this role at initial viewing, though it had nothing to do with his acting abilities. And in fact, once this initial impression is gotten over, one recognizes that Mr. Damon actually delivers a very solid, nuanced performance; and his boyish looks actually become an asset whose strength lies in a sense that his character is, actually, a 'puer aeternis'--a perpetual boy who never learned what it means to be a true man in the sense that fatherhood would require. Next, Angelina Jolie was grossly miscast as the lonely, bitter, betrayed housewife--though Ms. Jolie manages. I believe these casting miscues distracted from the film's forward motion, and so cost the film greatly I think, with much of the viewing public.

But on to the strengths. I must strenously disagree with the Amazon editorial review of Jae Ha Kim, who gets it backward: While elements of casting were weak, the plot/theme was brilliantly played out, with a perfectly paced 2 hours and thirty minutes (roughly). De Niro's decision to use flashback sequences to tell this story required this kind of extended time frame, as they are less direct from a plot-telling standpoint; and the 'flashbacks' device very usefully allowed the audience to focus on how Wilson has arrived at his present position, plot-wise and thematically; the flashbacks also created tension and suspense, as this film is very much a 'whodunit.' The cinematography was also meticulous, complementing the director's attention to plot detail, which added (along with the flashbacks) to an effect of seeing the unfolding of events through Wilson's very meticulous eyes.

And beyond the plot development, we have what makes this film excellent, and highly underrated: The themes of 'loyalty' and 'fatherhood' set against a backdrop of National Security. The 'loyalty' theme involves the question, ""which loyalty is most important: To country, to family, to fraternity (i.e., secret society running things), or to self?"" The 'fatherhood' theme involves the exploration of Wilson's own failures as a father to his son, which are instigated psychologically by his own father's failure to BE a father to him (Wilson's father takes his own life when Wilson is a boy); it also involves Wilson's becoming, in a sort of twist, a 'father to his country' in becoming one of the founding 'fathers' of the CIA. De Niro (Directing) interweaves these two themes brilliantly. And in this, the film's true plot (from a thematic standpoint) is about Wilson's personal journey from fatherless boy to a man who's own attempts at fatherhood are undermined and betrayed by his psychological inability to be a good father to his son. The terrible irony is that the personal qualities that compromise his own fatherhood abilities are the very ones that make him an effective spy. Pointedly, the film askes, ""is this a worthy tradeoff?"" And using this thematic query as a launching pad, this film is rightly seen as being a critique of not only the CIA, but of the nature of international ""spying"" in general. Boys are left fatherless through confused notions of ""loyalty"" to--what? And are the costs worth it?

Ultimately, this film seems to be arguing that a person's inability to honor himself and his family first, both corrupts and aids, ironically, his attempts to honor so-called 'greater' national and international interests; that America herself, in a way, is left fatherless by those running it, because those running it lack the psychological ability to understand what true ""fatherhood"" (either of a child or a country) means, by virtue of themselves having been left fatherless by their predecessors' own misgebotten sense of loyalty. At the same time, the film poses the question, ""what if, in the world of spying and counterintelligence between nations vying for power and survival, self/family values are not an asset, but rather a liability?""

Thus the film's title, ""The Good Shepherd,"" offers both a sarcastic irony, and a lament. An irony, as we watch these fatherless fathers of the nation fail their own families by giving greater loyalty to secret societies and notions of national ""duty,"" and by compromising their own moral high ground through twisted values of leadership. And a lament, for the world we live in is admittedly dog-eat-dog, and would appear to require a set of twisted values on the part of our leaders to ensure our survival.",1220227200,,4804,5.038993710691824

2752008,2,B000MXPE7Y,"De Niro makes a surprising move here into spy territory - not modern Bourne type stuff (despite the presence of Matt Damon) but more like an American John Le Carre type story, in its understated events and emphasis on character.  It's a noble endeavor, at times wonderfully shot - however, it is ultimately too flawed to succeed as entertainment.
The story revolves around the creation of the CIA, seen through the eyes of Edward Wilson (a composite of several real life characters).  It plays as a character driven story showing what can make a man choose a life of permanent paranoia and secrecy, and the impact that has on his life.  In this way the atmosphere around the time of the new Agency's genesis is portrayed rather than a strict blow by blow account of how it came to be.  A superb and committed cast have been gathered, (including a blink and you'll miss it cameo from Joe Pesci), and there is a clear feeling of the proceedings oozing talent, from art direction and photography, through to actors and music.
However, there is something about the pacing that is not quite right - at 160 minutes, we should have some significant moments of drama to drive our interest on, but somehow we are left with a spy story of non-people and non-events... a spy movie without suspense.  There's an interesting enough story arc for our main character, and the audience is asked to be intelligent enough to fill in some gaps - but the padding has turned what could have been an atmospheric and informative movie into something bloated and dull.  This is no epic or definitive account.
Regular readers of mine will know I am no huge fan of rapid fire MTV style editing a la `Armageddon' and its ilk - but a movie still has to have some drive and entertainment value.  That's missing here, despite the core having some very interesting things to say about the disease of loneliness and what it does to a man.

Our eventual realization that both our friends and our enemies have similar organizations, for similar reasons, creates in us, the viewers, a more-in-sadness-than-in-anger awareness that parallel organizations have probably always existed and, of necessity, probably always will.  The film's dialogue is often muffled, oblique, and hard to understand---in keeping with its atmosphere of secrecy---but the viewer thereby tends to lose the detail thread of what's going on at the  moment.

Despite his long hours spent in a library, nonchalance about women and inscrutable expression, Wilson simply can't be a raising star of the CIA, even if these vestiges have to testify that he has developed supreme analytical skills.
In fact, during the whole movie one can't stop asking, where does his authority come from?

2752013,4,B000MXPE7Y,"I loved this movie. Parts of it were difficult to watch, but it is a highly interesting, engaging film.

The movie tells the story of Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), an idealistic young poetry student at Yale. The son of a high-ranking federal judge, Wilson is tapped to become a member of the elite Skull and Bones society. After accepting, he is drawn further into a world where the expectations of others will govern his decisions. After a passionate roll in the hay with Clover (Angelina Jolie) at a Skull and Bones retreat, Edward learns she is pregnant. Though he is in love with another woman (the hearing-impaired Laura, played beautifully by Tammy Blanchard), Edward weds Clover.

The film is set at the end of World War II, when the OSS/CIA were operating/forming. Due to the strong connections of previous members (many of whom went on to work in the military and in government), several young men in the Skull and Bones society are chosen to work in intelligence and counterintelligence. Edward begins work, and the audience watches as he sacrifices one thing after another for his career. Protecting the United States is a noble calling, true, but Edward pays a high price for his devotion. He doesn't even see his son until the boy is more than five years old because of his overseas work. His relationship with his wife, what little there was of it to begin with, deteriorates due to neglect. He can't trust anyone, and so he doesn't.

What's fascinating about this film for me is that it isn't all flash and dazzle, like other spy films you may have seen. This film shows the slow, quiet work of the CIA. It shows the strategy behind the organization and what kind of power it wields. It also shows the birth of intelligence gathering in the United States, and it is pretty darn intriguing to go poking into some of those corners of U.S. history. More than anything, though, it illustrates what working in the intelligence industry does to the individuals who commit to it. (And it ain't pretty.)

I think Damon plays a role different from his ""type"" in this film. Edward has such a character arc. He starts the film with a wonderful, tender relationship with Laura. Though he never seems to be jolly, he is an earnest boy who is not without humor. But by the end of the film, Edward is so careful. He is so silent. He is damaged. Damon expertly paints Edward in all the tones of the things he does not say. This performance is a precise study in minimalism.

Angelina Jolie has some aching moments as Clover, as well. Being married to a ghost takes an enormous toll on Clover, and I have rarely seen Jolie play a character with such frailty. It was quite touching.

The films also boasts fine performances by Robert DeNiro (who also directed), William Hurt, Billy Crudup, and Alec Bladwin. I found this movie riveting, with both character and plot to spare. Acting is fabulous, and the subject matter couldn't get much jucier. Worth seeing.",1210377600,,2953,4.6692307692307695

(Di Niro himself provides a listless shuffle-on.)  While Jolie, Turturro, Gambon, Hutton, and Hurt are around a bit longer, none are around long enough to help.

Di Niro also shows us his Hollywood juice through funding; the film is beautifully produced, time and place are evoked exceptionally well, clothes, cars, interior design, all done with great care.  Why then is The Good Shepherd longer than a Sunday afternoon double-header between two last place teams?  For starters, the run-time is a shockingly self-indulgent 167 minutes, pushing the 3-hour envelope.  For another, absolutely nothing happens.  It would be tempting to blame this on Matt Damon, (still unconvincing when playing an adult, much less an adult in a position of authority), or on Eric Roth, who wrote the screenplay.  But Damon, as the ""anti-Bourne,"" is clearly doing what's he's told, and Roth's screenplay might have been good had it been significantly tightened.

As readers of John Le Carre know, the actual work of spies, the tradecraft, is extremely boring.  The fascinating aspect of their world lies in the personalities of these people, their emptiness, their loneliness, their complete inability to trust, their facility with lies until they arrive at the point where they're barely able to believe themselves, and the devastating emotional toll all of this takes.  Carre's work walks you through this inner landscape in a way film never can, because film is a visual medium, and watching a stone faced Matt Damon for the better part of 3 hours tells us nothing - which is rather the point - his ability to reveal nothing serves him well as a spy.

Di Niro gets an ""A"" for hubris, he strong-armed a lot of ""names"" onto the set.  And he gets an ""A"" for ambition, it's a complex story of inner turmoil, difficult moral choices, layers of deception, and the clash between idealism and pragmatism.  But he gets an ""F"" for implementation and direction, averaging out to a ""C.""  Where The Spy Who Came In From The Cold succeeded because of its laser-sharp focus; bloated scope and lack of character insight cause The Good Shepherd to resemble the Bay of Pigs.",1208131200,2,2626,4.86936936936937
2752015,5,B000MXPE7Y,"While very slow moving, the film still covers a lot of historical territory.  Young, idealistic college boys join the preWWII espionage agencies in Britain and the US because they want to live lives of importance and make a difference.  Three generations of Yale Skull n Bones, cronyism, the planting of moles in Soviet and American spy establishments, torture, careerism, the competition between the US and the USSR for Nazi physicists, the Cold War, the space race, and finally, the Bay of Pigs fiasco -- these are the big themes of this film, which spans 25 years in the life of Edward Wilson, the young spy who joins the OSS to atone for his father's traitorous mistake.  Add to that the sexual mores of the times (c. 1940) and Edward marries for honor, not for love.  The film casts a critical eye on espionage and the people who undertake it.

I liked Matt Damon in this film so much better than in the endless Bourne car chases, although his character is very hard to like.  Unlike some others who have written here, I did not think Angelina Jolie was in any way wasted in this role.  She poignantly plays an emotionally unstable woman who uses her sexuality to catch herself a husband, but ends up finding herself caught in a loveless marriage, so unsuited to be a CIA spouse.  I liked her much better here than in A Mighty Heart.  I agree with other reviewers who said that Robert DeNiro did a much better job directing this film than acting in it.  William Hurt does well as Edward's boss. Alec Baldwin plays a crusty FBI man.  Billy Crudup's British spy is so likeable that you know he will be a problem in the end. John Torturro as aide to Wilson is excellent, as are Oleg Shtefanko as Wilson's KGB counterpart and nemesis and Eddie Redmayne as Wilson's son.

The atmosphere, technology, and fashions of the times are also well represented here, which also makes gives the film its claustrophobia. This is a film which improves with multiple viewings, because every bit of dialogue adds a crucial detail to the plot.  It's a very sober enterprise up to and including the last scene, where we see Matt Damon as Wilson plodding diligently down the long hall of the new CIA wing where, as reward for all he has endured over the course of the film, he will be in charge of counterespionage efforts.  His pace and posture make it clear that he heeds the call of duty with a heavy heart.",1207958400,2,2393,4.547785547785548

2752018,1,B000MXPE7Y,"THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS!

I hated this movie.  From the start, the movie (while portraying itself and a historically based drama) plays with history to make a politically motivated piece, designed to mislead those without a working knowledge of history.

Within the first 20 minutes, I was worried what the film was going to portray.  Damon's character is contacted by a General William Sullivan, who has been tasked by the President (FDR) to create a secret service, knowing that the US will eventually be pulled into WWII.  He tells Damon that the soon to be OSS wants Ivy League Blue Bloods like him, not 'jews, negroes or Catholics.""  Sullivan smiles and essentially states that he can say the latter because he's a Catholic.

The man who created the OSS was William Donovan.  The writer plays with the Irish names but the character is Donovan. However, the portrayal of Donovan is purposefully wrong:  Donovan wasn't anti-Jewish, anti-black or Catholic.  He is famous for allowing anyone, from right wing to Communist into the OSS as he was dedicated to destroying Nazism.  This is something I have gleaned from reading at least 3 OSS books, one of them written by a man who was an admitted 60's activist who idolized Donovan because while he never limited himself by ideology (he was a a Republican who FDR trusted), he just wanted to defeat Nazism.  Thus, from the outset, the movie is falsely portraying the creator of the OSS, the precursor of the CIA, as racist, anti-semetic and intolerant.

Damon's Character:

Is cold and unemotional throughout most of the movie, except when he falls for the deaf girl.  This is done to let the viewer know that the future CIA betrayer has a soul.  Their most significant date is at an almost all black jazz club in 1940.  Thus, Damon's character (who eventually betrays the Bay of Pigs operation) isn't a traitor: he's a tolerant man who loves disabled women and is caught up in circumstances beyond his control, where he finally sees the truth.

Damon's character is cold, unable to relate to his own son.  As a a father he is purposefully distant, seeing fighting Communism as more critical than raising his son.  This means CIA are all cold and distant, Therfore, their mission (defeating Communism) is improper.

Angelina Jolie:

Her character plays an odd dual role:  she is Damon's unloved wife: mother of a child of a night of passion but never truly loved by Damon who's true love is a deaf woman.

Her role is not appropriate to her stature in Hollywood (a stature I disagree with).  In this movie, it is manipulation for the director, DeNiro, who plays with her fame:  how can Matt Damon ignore such a hot woman (Jolie) for a less attractive deaf one?  Jolie got Brad Pitt but she is incapable of winning Damon's character's heart.  He must be cold.  To make matters worse, he cheats on Jolie with a matronly German at a time when he purely hates Communists.  HE MUST he nuts if he wants an ugly German over a hot Jolie.

Viva Cuba:

Damon eventually betrays the Bay of Pigs invasion which would have overthrown Castro but Hollywood has romanticized Castro and Che, so the decision (of Damon) to betray the US in ordder to assist Castro is forgiveable and endlessly romantic.

Pure Propoganda:

As 'Sullivan' becomes more anti-Communust, he admits to suffering more and more to diabetes, which requires them to chop off his legs: thus, America is rotting from its fixation on Anti-Communism.

To add to this 'subtle' rotting analogy, there comes a the Soviet defector.  After being injected with LSD, he launches into a soliloquy where the defector admits the USSR is a paper tiger with no spare parts and no ability to fight; it's a creation of the 'military industrial complex' (yes, the Soviet uses the Eisenhower phrase) to maintain the  power of said complex... therefore, the Cold War is a hoax:  they were never a threat, just a pawn in the game of the Capitalist Industrialists!

This, of course, ignores the 70's where Communism spread worldwide.  A country with no spare parts somehow sustains a 10 year war in Afghanistan, requiring Reagan to authorize the dispatch of Stinger missiles to win the war. It ignores the 1956 invasion of Hungary, the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, the relentless efforts to turn Vietnam, Cambodia, Nicaragua, Ethiopia and many other nations into Communist pawns or the endless violations of SALT I, II and the ABM treaty.  Millions suffered under the yoke of communism, yet the Communists are innocent?  Preposterous.  Why is it I know of no Conservative who fails to conclude Nazism was an evil yet I can find Liberals who will defend Communism?

This movie exploits our short memories. DeNiro's position is that the Cold War was never a hot one, so the Communists were never a real threat.  This sickens me and anyone who knows how Eastern Europe suffered, but their names are hard to spell, so who cares.  At least, that is De Niro's view.

2752021,2,B000MXPE7Y,"Plenty of people have reviewed this film and have pretty much given the whole storyline.  I'm going to spare you the details of the story and get down to why I can't recommend this movie.

Like many people, I was excited about a spy movie that featured great actors, and had Robert De Niro directing.  The problem with the movie is that it is a complete bore.  The main mystery/plot of the film is similar to the one in the Kevin Costner movie ""No Way Out"".  Unlike ""No Way Out"", this one doesn't keep you on the edge of your seat.  Like ""The Godfather"", we bounce back and forth from past to present.  The problem is that we are intruduced to too many story lines and too many characters.  It was difficult to tell what the goal of the story was.  Matt Damon's character might as well have been played by a robot.  He shows absolutely no emotion.  It's hard to root for characters like this.  The movie has a few decent moments.  But at almost three hours long, the movie feels over done.  A good 45 minutes of this movie could have easily been cut out.

I think there might have been a decent story somewhere in there, but either the writing or directing or both stepped in its way.  We are constantly being sidetracked by subplots and characters with little meaning.  Add in a ridiculous revelation at the end that you could see coming the moment his son announced he wanted to work in the CIA, and this movie just doesn't hold up.  The effort was there, but sometimes a movie's parts are better than the whole.",1205539200,3,1514,4.365591397849462

2752023,3,B000MXPE7Y,"Robert DeNiro's 2006 ""The Good Sheperd"" is a thinly fictionalized account of the founding of the Central Intelligence Agency.  It features an array of talented actors, promising plot material, and some incredibly atmospheric cinematography.  It is also a long, dark, unhappy journey into a world so complex as to almost defy translation into a feature length film.

The story centers around Edward Wilson, a counterintelligence officer who at the opening of the movie is investigating a security breach affecting the failed CIA-sponsored 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion.  In a series of extended flashbacks, we learn that Edward was a young, idealist Yale graduate recruited into the Office of Strategic Services at the start of the Second World War.  He learns his trade from his British counterparts, already locked into a cutthroat duel with Nazi Germany.  Edward moves on to Berlin at the close of the war to recruit former Nazis and to size up the Soviets, who will be America's postwar competition.  In particular, he meets his Soviet counterpart, a spymaster codenamed Ulysses, who will haunt his career for the next two decades.

Edward returns to America in 1946, to a new organization that will become the CIA and to a loveless marriage with a woman he got pregnant right before the war.  His duties will involve him in CIA adventures in Guatemala and Cuba and in handling Soviet defectors.  As the movie circles back to the present, Edward traces a series of clues to the shocking source of the leak on the Bay of Pigs.  The answer will threaten his career and what remains of his family life.

Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson as a quiet, dedicated but guarded man; he learns the hard way that no one can be trusted.  The hazards and hard moral choices of his career turn a likeable poetry-loving student into a man all but emotionally inaccessible by movie's end.  Angela Jolie puts in a anguished performance as Wilson's wife, who lives a sterile life with a man often gone and withdrawn when home.  Alec Baldwin has a nice turn as an FBI agent who works with Wilson on a number of cases.  John Turturro is superb as Wilson's long-time assistant.  Billy Crudup and William Hurt play fellow OSS and CIA colleagues.

This movie gets a lot of things right about the espionage business.  The founders of the OSS and CIA relied on ties among Ivy League alumni as a substitute for a vetting process.  The spy and counterspy business between the US and Soviet Union did become a wilderness of mirrors.  The Edward Wilson character seems loosely based on James Angleton, the CIA counterintelligence chief who spent years looking for Soviet moles in the CIA.

The story is extremely complex, even for those familiar with the history of the CIA.  The average viewer may be challenged to keep track of the characters and their motives.  The focus of the movie is really the effects of the spy business on its practioners; action is infrequent apart from the deaths of several agents.  This movie is likely to appeal primarily to serious fans of the spy business and the spy movie genre.",1205020800,5,3081,4.8007590132827325

2752025,3,B000MXPE7Y,"This is a very hard film to love, eventhough it resonates from a good screenplay and top notch acting.  Damon is in top form and a stoic spook, his character is hard to like much less love, I really could not for the life of me figure out why Jolie stays with him for so long; he is a bad husband and an even worse father, it is heart wrenching to watch his young son beg for his father's attention and Damon all but ignore him.  Damon puts country above all else and its amazing how startlingly obtuse he is about his families needs.  The film is beautifully shot and though quite lengthy its does not lag.  I really liked Michael Gambon in this, he is not what he seems and his advice to Damon, though not heeded, was the most valuable intelligence Damon gets..get out while you still can.  Damon's character does several things in this movie, that seem so out of character for someone so measured and with very good survival skills, but i suppose it's to propel the narrative, but still it's perplexing.  Be sure to watch the deleted sceens, because, it includes a story line that should have been kept in the movie, De Niro should have cut some of himself out of this film and left some of the deleted sceens in.  There is a great sceen toward the end with Joe Peci, and Peci asked Damon, and im perapharsing, he says...we italians have family and church, the irish have the irish nationalism, the jews have tradition, and he asked Damon, what do you have..meaning the WASP establishment I suppose, and Damon says..I have the united states of america, you people are only visiting..it's shocking in its honestly perfectly illuminates how a person of his time and place would have thought..in a word..scary!",1203638400,,1710,4.532467532467533
2752026,5,B000MXPE7Y,"""The Good Shepard"" is a slow paced film that really surprised me because its countless images filled of semiotic profile. It's about a devoted functionary of the CIA in those hard times from the first days of the WW2 until the not so well reminded and frustrated invasion of the marines in Cuba.

The use of greyish lights (Please remember Sidney Lumet's The verdict)  is transcendental around practically every single frame of the movie, the faces are involved into a diffuse atmosphere, as the truth they keep is. On the other hand we will assist to the progressive and unstoppable crumbling of the marriage of this efficient agent, who sees what's going on around his personal life, and is incapable to make nothing to avoid it.

William Hurt, Angelina Jolie, John Tuturro and Matt Damon are stunning every one of them, from their perspectives, make of this personal film of Robert de Niro appears as one of the most intriguing and devastating films in years around the times in which the C.I.A. was best known as the O.S.S.

2752028,5,B000MXPE7Y,"I gave this film 5 stars for its courage and willingness to trust the intelligence of the audience to unravel a complex plot and complicated relationships. This is not an easy film for those who don't wish to solve the multiple puzzles we are presented. The film reflects a philosophy that both character analysis and espionage are complex, multi-layered, and often are not what they seem on the surface.

The film uses a crisis situation at the CIA to unfold the history of the CIA as well as the history of the agency's top administrators that parallels the development of the agency and its mission. The Bay of Pigs invasion is a failure and it appears that Fidel Castro and his Soviet handlers were well aware of where the invading force would land on the coast of Cuba. This crisis is revisited repeatedly as we see the development of the CIA and the development of Edmund Wilson, an OSS Officer who becomes a CIA founder.

Matt Damon plays a resolved, cold character, Edmund Wilson, who is dedicated to the protection of his country even though there are multiple consequences for him, his wife, and his son. He receives two odd, manipulated video and audio tapes that begin to reveal who might have tipped off the soviets and Fidel that the Americans were coming. These tapes are all part of a complex effort to neutralize Wilson by the KGB.

The film traces the development of the agency from its OSS roots in World War II. Wilson becomes a spy and is located in London during the war where he is involved with some of the spy and counter-spy activities with the Nazis. His old English Professor at Yale turns out to be a spy who mentors him during the war on intelligence gathering and analysis. However after the war in post-war Berlin he gets to fully experience and develop his craft in a cat and mouse game with the Soviets as they try to find Nazi scientists that both wish to capture and recruit for the emerging cold war.

Yet all these espionage experiences also teach him that he can not trust anyone as he experiences duplicity from trusted friends and associates. Gradually Wilson becomes more aware of his KGB rival and they play a deadly and complex game to undermine each other's attempts at intelligence gathering. For example, Wilson attempts to get Nazi scientists out of Germany before the Soviets can obtain them. His translator is eventually revealed to be a spy who is helping the Soviets obtain the scientists or at least trade Jewish scientists for Nazi scientists.

The Soviet spy known as Ulysses sends decoy officials to give disinformation to the CIA, he follows Wilson and tries to disrupt his marriage when Wilson has a one-night-stand with an old girlfriend. Eventually the pain and intrigue gets closer and closer to Wilson, trying to find a way to compromise his integrity and put him in a position to give information to the Soviets.

I found the film very interesting and complex, requiring me to pay attention to subtle relationships, images, lines of dialogue, and understated movements. This gives the film a feeling of authenticity. In addition, the KGB and the CIA both played very dirty and this seems very realistic. We see spies killed once they are no longer needed and have too much information to allow to live.

The cast was superb with Matt Damon playing a cool, hardened man who has sacrificed much for his country yet his sacrifice is silent and only he really knows the extent of what he has lost and how little he has personally gained. In fact, the man had not really gained personally at all except that he has been given intellectually devious competition against which he feels he must prevail. He sacrificed his first love to marry the pregnant sister of his Yale friend and co-member of the Skull and Bones club.

Angelina Jolie plays the flirty passionate Senator's daughter who becomes married to a cold man possessed with a mission to protect the USA. She is neglected and resentful. Years of absence from the home distances husband and wife until Edmund can only feel compassion for his wife for all she has endured to support his career and dedication.

William Hurt plays the handsome, smart, first director of the CIA who overplays his hand by becoming a board member of a coffee company that benefits from the CIA assassinating the President of a Latin American nation that was nationalizing the businesses within their borders on a path toward Communism. Edmund Wilson gentle lets him know that the game is up and thus allows him to resign and move on without scandal.

Robert De Nero plays the role of a General who heads OSS and then lays the groundwork for the CIA at the end of WWII. Alec Balwin plays a cool detached FBI agent who is an ally for Wilson and allows him to identify problem personnel within the CIA. Billy Crudup plays his British counterpart and mentor who eventually is revealed to be something other than what he presents. Joe Pesci plays a Mafia don who assists in the Bay of Pigs invasion when Castro takes over 4 of his casinos in Havana.

Eventually the Bay of Pigs crisis is resolved from the intelligence aspect and the culprit who has said too much is revealed. Heavy prices are paid.

Those that serve their country with their minds are often overlooked and under appreciated since they make personal sacrifice that only they know have been made. The sacrifices are not made just by the individual who is in government service, but also by those that love him/her and those that he/she loves. This intelligent film honors all those individuals. It is brave motion picture making.",1200873600,10,5584,4.710040983606557

It required more than one viewing for me to unravel a plot that went back and forth between present and past, but it made sense after a couple of viewings.  Matt Damon is excellent as is the rest of the cast.  No one should take this for history, but it does provide what seems to be some insight into the mentality of CIA and its Soviet counterpart, KGB during the Cold War.  One of the most interesting episodes is what happens to a KGB agent who is mistakenly believed to be a plant trying to discredit a true KGB defector.

The movie is set against a variety of important events in U.S. history, which makes the whole government/political aspect of the film very detailed and accurate. However, there's no spark on the emotional side of things. Damon delivers a strong performance as much as the script allows, but his character is a hollow shell of a man who lacks any emotion or feeling, and therefore makes it virtually impossible for the audience to sympathize for him in any way. This movie is almost three hours long, which seems like a lifetime when you haven't developed any sort of attachment to the main character. The supporting cast of the film is very impressive and includes the likes of Angelina Jolie, Joe Pesci, and Robert De Niro (who also directed the film). However, I don't think any of the characters were well-developed enough to allow the actors to display their vast talents, and therefore this film kind of missed its mark for me.",1198627200,26,1125,4.774358974358974

Now it does tell you at the bottom of the screen what year you're in but it switched so mamy times that I got lost once and couldn't figure out if I was in the 40's or the 60's and to tell you the truth at that point of this almost 3 hour movie. I really didn't care. I also had trouble keeping track of who all the characters were. The director does not do a good job of explaining things. You just have to figure it all out for yourself. And though I did watch the whole movie and I do understand what it's about. I think I would have to watch it about 2 more times to really get everything. But I'm just not willing to invest 9 hours on this. I'm sorry I wasted the 3. I watched it with my girlfriend and we kept asking each other ""Do you understand what's going on""?, ""Who's this person""?, ""what year are we in""?

 I have other issues with this movie other than the convoluted story. The whole movie is filmed very, VERY, dark! It's like you're watching it with sunglasses on. There's one part in the movie when they get a russian spy to cross to their side, and they pretty much just take him at his word and consider him one of them. Later on in the movie another russian claims to be the same guy and wants to cross and says that the other Russian is a mole. Instead of taking this guy at his word, they torture him for several hours and when he sticks to his story they give him LSD as a truth serum and not only does he STILL stick to his story but he jumps out the window killing himself. All this gives the agents NO reason to believe that the guy they're trusting MIGHT actually be the mole!!! They don't torture him, they don't even question him. They just go on believing him. And guess what. He turns out to be the mole. Matt Damon finds this out by noticing a feather coming out of a book that one of his spy friends gave the mole. He then peels back the inside cover of the book reveiling a passport and other incriminating evidence. I mean this is truly stupid and really made the whole movie stupid.

2752035,4,B000MXPE7Y,"If there ever was a worn out spy, Matt Damon is definitely the one in his fine portrayal of Edward Wilson, CIA agent from priviledged family and Yale education.  I have not seen a character like this since John Le Carre's agent Smiley.  Edward is a quiet man, who keeps his emotions and feelings to himself. He is also damaged, since as a child, he witnessed his father's suicide.  The emotional void of having a father figure in his life, pushes him towards seemingly caring man such as his mentor at the university and eventually towards career in CIA.  Edward is pushed into a marriage to a woman (played by Angelina Jolie) he barely knows and the marriage is doomed from the start.  Their son, the bond that keeps the marriage together is also a reminder to both of them of their poor match.  As we trace Edward's career thru some of the important events of the cold war, we learn about him as a father, husband, lover and the unscrupulous secret agent.  It is difficult to imagine that sensitive young man, interested in poetry and above all loyal to the people close to him would resort to the dread of a life of a spymaster full of secrets and lies.  But then, as the film reaches its conclusion we almost get to think of him as a an on the suicide mission of his own.  He is not looking into pulling the trigger on himself, but he is walking on the tight rope, close to falling at any time.  Then again, he is so worn out and alone, that after al, he has very little to lose in this game.  Directed by Robert DeNiro with wonderful cast of actors.",1196035200,2,1554,4.324137931034483
2752036,3,B000MXPE7Y,"I tried my hardest to fall in love with Robert De Niro's ""The Good Shepherd.""  All the elements were there for a great film - fantastic material (the birth of the CIA and the Cold War), great cast, and more-than-ample budget.  Unfortunately, the total is far less than the sum of its parts - and far more tedious.

Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson, privileged Yale undergraduate who gets inducted into America's least-secret secret society, Skull and Bones.  Given this access to privilege, Wilson receives a unique opportunity - to get in on the ground floor of America's new secret service, the OSS (the forerunner of the CIA).  Over the next few decades, Wilson will play a key part in the evolution of the Cold War.

This should be exciting stuff.  Terrific authors have had loads of fun with the very same material - John Le Carre, Robert Littell, James Ellroy - and their novels are riveting page-turners.  Thanks in large part to Damon's depiction of Wilson as an extremely cold fish, ""The Good Shepherd"" is largely an exercise in exposition and tedium.  Events transpire, characters grow old or die young, and bitterness and recrimination stalk the land.  Sometimes that works in a movie - this is not such an occasion.

Put ""The Good Shepherd"" on the shelf with the Great Missed Opportunities of recent years - movies that should have been terrific and yet failed to live up to expectations.",1195430400,,1398,4.783333333333333

This film just bites off more than most any movie could ever chew. It should be lauded for its ambition, but it's just too slow and sprawling to really move the viewer as much as it wants to.

Damon is good but not great, and never made me care much for his character. Same for Jolie and most everyone else. Not a great script, but I applaud the effort to inject some truth into the many CIA myths out there. The MK-Ultra scene was quite interesting. Anyone who's read some the books by ex-agents will recognize some enlightening little tid-bits; the cynicism generated by playing both sides against the middle comes through nicely.

In the end, however, close but no cigar. The definitive Agency film has yet to be made. But then, that might be far too much truth for the kool-aid drinkers to grasp...",1195257600,2,813,4.517006802721088

At the core, it is about how someone losses their soul, bit by bit; and, lives a life less full than it could have been. I was surprised that I liked it, as I normally not very interested in spy movies. While there is some killing, it is not the focus of the movie; rather what is important is inner destruction. Effectively jumps around in time, which is something that I normally do not like; but well and usefully done here. Outstanding performances by everyone who has a speaking role, particularly Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie who give understated performances.

2752040,3,B000MXPE7Y,"THE GOOD SHEPHERD depicts the decades long growth of the CIA from its inception as seen through the eyes of a youthful rookie agent Edward Wilson, played by Matt Damon, whose screen character requires him to keep bottled up within him all emotion.  It is his inability to articulate his feelings that form an unexpected subtext.  From the time that we first meet a preteen Edward, who has witnessed the suicide of his father to the close of the film, we see the growth of an agent whose needed silences mark him as a superior operative but ironically require him to pay a personal price that alienates him from his wife and son.  Angelina Jolie is his wife Margaret, who is attracted to Edward from the start and she makes it clear that she wants him as a husband.  Her tragedy is that despite her character's smarts she does not foresee that the wife of an operative must be willing to share him with his job.  She can overlook a fling with a woman but demands what Edward cannot provide, which is meaningful daily contact with a man who is aware of her private needs. What becomes evident soon enough is that even had Edward chosen another profession, his self-imposed silences probably would have led to conflict.

THE GOOD SHEPHERD is a film that smacks of a quasi-documentary that depicts a pre-war America that has no effective intelligence department and must develop one to keep pace first with Nazism, then with Soviet communism.  Damon's low-key performance is effective more because of than despite his interpretation of a man who is constantly told to trust no one.  There is a gripping subplot that suggests that someone in his section is a Soviet mole, a premise that reinforces this theme that a lack of trust is the inevitable result of a life that suggests that secrets must be locked up either in one's heart or in one's lockbox safe.  The ending is deliberately lacking in an upbeat closure. The power of THE GOOD SHEPHERD lies in its ability to recreate an era that demanded that those who chose to play the game of intelligence often found that they were not the only ones who had to pay that price.",1194825600,2,2120,4.6021220159151195

2752042,4,B000MXPE7Y,"As the product review shows, the crtiics and, indeed, most viewers did not 'get' The Good Shepherd.  Although realizing that it was a subdued and cerebral film, most who have watched it did not 'get' what the film was all about.  Let's take another look at what is a slightly flawed but essentially brilliant movie that might just be worth your money and time after all!

What this film is not:  This film is not an espionage thriller.  This film is not a history of the CIA--that's the backdrop.

What this film is:  The personality study and life history of one of the CIA's earliest employees, Edward Wilson (a fictitious character, played by Matt Damon, who shows surprising acting depth in the understated but intense character).  The film serially develops Wilson's web of loyalties and relationships, with the Yale professor he admires, with his wife (Angelina Jolie, miscast rather badly in one of the films few flaws), with Skull and Bones, and with his son.  He also has complex loyalties with a KGB rival and a defector.  Plus, there are CIA Founder Wild Bill Donovan (well-done by actor-director deNiro), Damon's supervisor (William Hurt) and his FBI liaison (Alec Baldwin).

Each and every one of these institutions or characters comes forth at some point to test Damon's loyalties.  Will he compromise his country for an engaging KGB man who wants to do him ""a very great favor?""  Will he put his love of family above his love of country?  Which comes first, Loyalty to Skull and Bonesmen or the Agency?  His boss or his integrity?

Joe Pesce, in a cameo as a retired mob boss, tells Damon ""We Italians, we have our food, our families, our church; what do YOU have?""

Damon's reply tells the viewer why the film is titled as it is:  ""I have the United States of America.""

Watch carefully for the nuances of the gift shop scene with the KGB and you will unravel the last mysrey of a long, subtle, film that gets more engaging as it goes along.

If the above sounds good, maybe this IS the film for you to buy and watch a few times to pull out the enjoyable nuances and delightfully light directorial touches.",1194307200,3,2122,4.638069705093834

I hope, DeNiro will continue this story.",1194134400,,355,4.313432835820896
2752044,3,B000MXPE7Y,"You can tell that Robert DeNiro really cares about what he's telling us here...probably too much so.  A little more objectivity and a much better film might have emerged.

The spy game and its corroding effects on the human psyche are much better told by LeCarre.  Still it's a good theme and worth exploring.  There's just too much crammed in here and as much as I cared to follow the intricacies of the plot after while I lost interest.  I think DeNiro had to chose which of the two plots to focus on - the spy plot or the human drama; he tried for too much and as a result people just get tired of watching and lose interest.

The cast is stellar and they all do heroic jobs.  I usually love Matt Damon and I don't fault him for the less-than-fascinating performance.  He was undoubtably told to play ""cold"" and ""emotionally detached"" and he gave us that for two hours and forty some minutes.  I think that the development, or devolution of his character would have been much more interesting if we had seen more of the younger, livelier man, who gradually hardened into stone.  The most interesting parts of the film were his brief love scenes with the two hearing impaired women.

Angelina Jolie did a wonderful job but I think she was miscast.  She was far too exotically beautiful to play a girl whom Damon would so easily ignore.

As other reviewers here have mentioned, there are certainly some cliches indulged in...There's no guessing what DeNiro thinks about WASP culture...gee, are they all as bad as that?!!

The film isn't awful, as Hollywood films go, but I suggest that anyone really interested in the genre to skip this and re-watch the LeCarre films.",1193788800,2,1669,4.594594594594595

Wilson throws himself into his work, but Cold War paranoia takes over and, distrusting all around him, his job has dire consequences for his marriage (to Jolie), his family and his sanity.

2752050,3,B000MXPE7Y,"I classify movies as see/don't see. Amongst the ""see"", they're either rent or own. I own The Good Shepherd, but would be just as satisfied if I had rented it.
This is the genre of John le Carre, not James Bond. It's closer to fact than fiction. The spy business is slow and painstaking. As such, the craft doesn't lend itself well to dynamic fictional films we've grown to crave.
Good Shepherd accurately depicts the recruitment by the character representing Wild Bill Donovan (Robert DeNiro)of Ivy Leaguers into the OSS..aka ""Oh So Social"". Right on target there. The chill of the Ivy League personality is well portrayed by Matt Damon, but his character goes overboard. Not to give away any highlights, but it would take an abnormally and truly unbelieveably cold man to resist the amorous advances of a young, randy ""Clover""...Angelina Jolie. His war years and craft development droll on slowly. Return to the States and a marriage to the new CIA - clearly chosen over ""Clover"", whom he opts to ignore to the point you are thinking he either has a) no emotion or b) no testosterone. His relationship with his son is as warm and fuzzy, and resurfaces as a keystone in the film as Damon is haunted by questions of honor and the memories of his own Father. The cinematography is pretty good, as is the overall acting. Don't expect to see the Damon of the Bourne films or the sharp mouthed wit of Good Will Hunting...there is a memorable line delivered by Damon during dialogue with Danny Devito that's not to be missed; it screams volumes of the WASP elite culture. The cast is solid, the story a good one...and disturbingly believeable. Conspiracy theorists sensing a Skull & Bones Yalie behind every Government action will walk away nodding their heads.

Yes, sometimes the CIA can be pretty pathetic, too, but at least their pathos is not contrived, it just happens, humans being human, after all.  DeNiro's pathetic film is totally contrived and seems to be directed at making the USA's spy mission somehow evil.  What were we (the US) to do during the Second World War and the following Cold War?  Close our eyes and pretend that the Soviets and Papa Joe Stalin were a bunch of nice guys not trying to get us.  They certainly were trying to get us and if sometimes our spy agencies screwed up, well, as I said above, they were human; and if anyone thinks the Soviets didn't screw up, they need to read up on their history.

Well, it misses.  The history is compelling; the sound effects and sets excellent.  The performances are also excellent.  However, the back-and-forth ""flashbacks"", etc. make the story difficult to follow.  I have a serious interest in history, but even I had trouble figuring out what was going on; I had to spend a lot of time explaining what was going on to my wife . . .!

Biggest problem was the vocal track; far, far too subdued.  I realize that this is a ""spy movie"", and everybody constantly talks in low voices and whispers . . .but several times we had to ""rewind"" a bit to try to follow what was going on when we couldn't catch the dialogue the ""first time"".

Plus, you'd better be wide awake when you watch this, or you'll fall asleep; it's a ""quiet"" film, with little action.

2752053,3,B000MXPE7Y,"Robert De Niro takes the director's chair in this 2006 CIA epic. Matt Damon stars as Edward Wilson, whose career as an agency spook begins with his enlistment into the OSS during WW 2 and continues through that organization's metamorphosis into the CIA.

The film opens in 1961, at the time of the Bay of Pigs invasion. When we are first introduced to Wilson, it is quickly established that he is an officious and inscrutable, yet loyally dedicated Company man. As the story begins to jump back and forth in time (a la ""Godfather II"") we begin to get glimpses of what lies beneath Wilson's seemingly impenetrable veneer.

We witness a (relatively) looser and more outgoing Wilson during his college days at Yale in 1939, as he is inducted into the infamous Skull and Bones society. As part of the initiation ritual, he is directed to regale his fellow Bonesmen with the deepest, darkest secret from his past. The club members get more than they bargain for as Wilson relates a harrowing childhood memory of bearing witness to his father's suicide. Moments before taking his own life, his father hands down a credo about ""trust"", which becomes the key to unlocking Wilson's inner workings for the remainder of the film.

Therein lies the problem with ""The Good Shepherd"". There is an awful lot of internalizing going on (for 2 hours and 47 minutes). De Niro's plus as a director (not surprisingly) is his willingness to give his actors plenty of room to breathe and inhabit their characters. His minus as a director is his willingness to give his actors plenty of room to breathe and inhabit their characters, if you catch my drift. There are some pacing issues with the film. Not that I was expecting car chases and stuff blowing up real good. After all, the reality of espionage does not necessarily lend itself to flash cuts and pop music montage. It's generally a somewhat somber, mundane and unpleasant business.

Eric Roth's script has its moments, but gets murky when it comes to the intrigue. It is tough to keep track of who is doing what to whom, and why (and at times, for whose ""side""?). Granted, perhaps that is part of the point; torture is torture and murder is murder, no matter how one attempts to rationalize (a point that Steven Spielberg more than sufficiently bludgeoned us over the head with in ""Munich"") but I GET it,already.

Perhaps the most fatal flaw in the film is Matt Damon's unconvincing ""aging"". There is not much discernable physical transformation between Wilson's collegiate years and middle age. (Maybe some better prosthetic work could have helped?). At any rate, I just wasn't buying it, and found it to be a major distraction.

This is stunning in its photography. Kudos to Director Robert De Niro and Director of Photography Robert Richardson for their work in here.

I also appreciated the low profanity in here. After watching ""The Departed,"" this far-cleaner film was a treat for the ears, too. Yes, there are a handful of 'f-words,"" but not much else including no blasphemy.

He plays an extremely loyal CIA man, a guy who is straight-arrow and one whose priority is country-first. The dilemma occurs at the end when he must choose between what's best for his son or his country.

It's a thought-out, interesting story that takes a few sides to the left of center more than the right, but is not really a movie with any heavy-handed political agenda, mainly pointing out what it takes to be a successful ""spy"" and that this unemotional detachment can be rough on some people and their families.

These men enter a cerebral world where they have to live by something not taught at Yale -- their wits -- to survive.

These men (and some women) are all around us.  There are decisions made thousands of times a day to put business or political objectives before family and friends, though not always with the dramatic alienation that this movie depicts.  But every such decision, compounds over time to produce alienation from loved ones.

2752061,5,B000MXPE7Y,"NEW REVIEW in 2017

It was a nostalgic film in 2006 when the wars started by George W. Bush in Afghanistan and Iraq were turning stale and sinking in the quagmire of all colonial and imperialistic wars. It was of course a comment on these wars like when Edward Wilson says We are trying to make wars small. That is sure right if we can say so without sounding sarcastic, even at the time. They were in the process of getting their fingers into Vietnam after the defeat of the Bay of Pigs and Cuba. Of course far worse was to come, precisely Afghanistan and Iraq. They financed Al Qaeda in Afghanistan against the Soviet who pulled out rather fast. And now the USA have to face them and some dissidents or alternative factions in the fields George W. Bush decided all by himself and like a big boy to invade.

That was a time when intelligence was important against Hitler but they met with Soviet spies in Germany and they did not necessarily have the upper hand. In fact, they were infiltrated very early after the war and in spite of what the film implies, that was not the cause of their lack of success and their future failures. They failed because the objective was wrong: they wanted to manipulated governments and states in other countries, hence their objective was imperialistic and that went against the grain of history that was witnessing the fall of all big colonial empires and the withering of any kind of imperialistic ambitions. They also went against the grain of the new phase of our human development that was and still is based on economic growth and welfare state policies.

But the film shows far too well that the life of such spies is not a human life. Far from home, far from wives and children, entangled in all kinds of affairs and constantly the target of rival spying factions that try to get some information and leverage over you by getting something about you that should not become public (blackmail) or by menacing your spouses or your children.

The film is well performed by seasoned actors though the shifting in time is at times difficult to follow in spite of the places and dates given now and then, though not all the time (where is the scene in Africa: Ivory Coast or Congo Kinshasa?). The most difficult problem was simply Matt Damon who was running in the film from the late 30s to the early 60s and he really was the same man not looking in anyway younger when necessary and older when needed. It is surprising because nowadays the make-up department of any studio can do a better job.

At times here and there we have some extremely arrogant and irritating remarks that are supposed to be pieces of humor like the following:

Richard Hayes: I remember a senator once asked me. When we talk about ""CIA"" why we never use the word ""the"" in front of it. And I asked him, do you put the word ""the"" in front of ""God""?

Thats the arrogance of George W. Bush who was pushed aside by Obama for eight years in 2008 who in his turn tried to have diplomacy prevail, though he was obsessive and obsessional about cyber security and cyber intelligence and had everyone in the world eavesdropped upon by the CIA. Note I must be old fashioned and from outside the institution because I do say THE CIA, but also THE FBI and a few others.

The film will tell you how foolish of Trump if he were to start another front somewhere in the world. But there is no one more foolish than, a populist politician or a circus clown. The difference is that when the populist politician falls on his face it is in the midst of maximum destruction and mass killings, whereas a clown falls on his face to make children laugh. Sooner or later Trump will be the monster in the closet that will come out if you do not go to sleep immediately. How many lateral, bilateral and collateral victims will you count in six months? Already several thousands in just a few weeks.

OLD REVIEW, MANY YEARS AGO

This is an essential film to understand where the world stands and where it is going in the present period. De Niro signs here a severe and ruthless denunciation of the methods of the US government in the world since they started the CIA at the end of the 30s. A young man, the son of a dead-by-suicide officer of some sort, is recruited by the FBI to find out the identities of the members of a fascist group that is in fact in the hand of an American agent unknown of the FBI. He will then become an essential agent in London during the war and in Berlin after the world, covered as a commercial agent, and it is trade and nothing else, to exchange some fascist scientists who are not too important for the Jewish scientists the Soviets are getting rid of.

This will lead the main character who is the head of the office in Berlin to recruit a KGB agent into his service. What is very strange is that the CIA does not find out this agent is being recruited under the name of another KGB agent (the CIA was un-informed on the subject which means they did not cover the whole world and had weak points, just like the Soviet should not have used the name of another KGB agent) and it is done with the complicity of an English agent. This man will become the mole in the CIA when Cuba becomes communist and when the US tries to organize the re-conquest in the Bay of Pigs.

The failure is so enormous that they decide that there must have been a mole. And they start looking for it. The Soviet then start playing cat and mouse with the main character and manage to compromise his son in the business by making him fall in love with a woman in Africa, or at least have a sudden desire for the woman that turns into love but this woman is one of their agents. That titillates the man and he really digs out what he can dig out and finds out the real mole by some simple action: to check a book that was offered to that mole by some English agent when he was finally recruited by the CIA.

That book should have been checked and was not. Negligence and non-professionalism. And this ex-KGB agent is never the object of the slightest doubt even when another KGB agent arrives and pretends he is the man carrying the name the ex-KGB agent has been recruited under. It is the son who will pay, and pay dearly, for the amateurish caper, indirectly for sure since the woman will be eliminated. So much for love among spies. But what is left after this action is finished, a tremendous action with numerous intertwined though clearly identified flashbacks over the whole period from the 1920s to the mid 1960s?

First that this CIA was born in super-patriotic and super-nationalist secret groups in the US, groups that ignore democracy and in a way human dignity, since the new members have to go through a fight in the nude, in mud and with the older members eventually pissing on them. These circles and groups are dangerous. What's more they are so closed up onto themselves that they lose somewhere the necessary objectivity and a negligence becomes possible and a double agent can infiltrate the whole system. The second lesson is that this CIA is supposed to reshape the world in conformity with what the US wants.

This is also very dangerous, and there the film is totally idealistic: the CIA can do what they want they can only slow down change in the world, not reverse it, Latin America being the best case ever. It has never been so nearly unanimously on the left, dark and deep pink if not completely red, and only as a reaction to the US's use of the CIA to manipulate people. These agents are also extremely inhuman. They have to forget all links with family, friends, relatives, or any acquaintances.

They must be ready to betray all these in the name of their mission and purity and kill every time it is necessary. They are kept under constant surveillance either by the other side or by people on the US side that no one knows. The film finally gives you one example of the El Ghraib torturing methods and that really makes you shudder and shiver. And the tragic end will be all the more pathetic when we know the victim was right and telling the truth. A film you must see absolutely.

2752062,5,B000MXPE7Y,"Not the typical spy movie, more a beautifully directed intense psychological drama.
Flashback: The six year old Edward Wilson watches his father prepare to commit suicide, although at that moment the boy doesn't realize it. His father discovers him, sends him away, closes the door and shoots himself. This traumatic experience ironically prepares Edward for a career in the CIA. It will take him around the globe, far away from home, maybe even away from his soul...
Edward (wonderfully portrayed by Matt Damon) is almost unable to show his true feelings. He talks very little, gives up his true love to stay with the woman who will give birth to his son (marvelous: Angelina Jolie).
For all of his life he will sacrifice everything around him to serve his country. It is all he has.
When, after the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he is asked to find the mole in the organization, he begins to realize there is not anyone he can trust, never was. Not his father, not his university teacher, not his so-called friends, not even his super.
There might have been loved ones who could have saved him from all his internal misery: his first love, his wife, his son. But it is too late. He  cannot trust and there is betrayal all around. It becomes clear that he  never got over that terrible shock when he entered the room and found his father lying dead on the floor.
A wonderful film about fate and the choices we all make, where they lead us and what might have been had we taken another road...
The images are perfect, the actors magnificent, Robert De Niro's directing superb. A very complex must have to watch over and over again.
As to the length of the movie. I just noticed other reviewers had a problem with that. Not me. I never got bored for a second. I never even got pulled away from the storyline. Sure, it is 2 hours and 40 minutes long, but I didn't realize it until the credits started rolling.
As always (well, almost) the HD DVD's images are brilliant and the combo disc includes 16 minutes of deleted scenes (in HD), picture in picture access.",1186617600,50,2049,4.535135135135135
2752063,1,B000MXPE7Y,"A beautifully filmed piece of worthless sheet of Anti-American propaganda: Leni Riefenstahl would be proud.

Back in the old days (pre-1940), Ivy League schools weren't meritocracies but sylvan glades where the sons of wealthy East Coast patricians gambolled and frolicked before taking their rightful place running government and corporations like the good oligarchs they were. And this film purports to get to the psychological and sociological roots of how very very evil all that was....and still is.

Which is why it is a beautifully gilded crock of smelly horse pucky, with clouds of green bottle flies dining on its moist putrid reek. It was so bad I could not stop watching, and eventually started laughing.

For those of you who want to cut-to-the chase for the thesis here is the stunning, original, insightful, startling, brave, rebellious, and groundbreaking insight this monumental film contributes to history (the ""Oscar"" statuette for the first time-ever! bends at the waist and bows his head)......

...........shhhhhhh....sshhhhhhhhhh.....De Niro is about to pronounce... (a kind of hush falls over humanity as we anticipate this genius .....as he proclaims the dawn of a new age with his word)....

""WASPs are evil.""

There it is. The WASP sense of entitlement, noblesse oblige, privilege, power ...it is all a mask for murderous racist misogynistic eugenic horror. These guys don't need triple-K hoods because they have old school ties instead.

Okay, the good things: this is a beautifully filmed movie, with absolutely lovely sets, the art direction and the cinematography and yes, even the direction is excellent.

Tammy Blanchard is stunning as Laura, an old girlfriend of the hero whose presence and then absence from his life provides leitmotifs of loss throughout. Her performance alone is worth watching this film, and she was so good I'm going to seek out her other work just based on what she did here.

William Hurt is particularly well-cast as a leading patrician spook and delivers his usual good performance.

Angelina Jolie is okay, but you can't ever get into her character because De Niro's direction, and her wardrobe, and her makeup all were carefully constructed to say only one thing and one thing loudly ""HEY LOOK! WE GOT ANGELINA JOLIE IN THIS PICTURE! PRETTY SWEET, EH?!"" it is impossible to forget that it is *her* and not *her*character*.

The minor characters outshine the stars throughout. Joe Pesci is dead on in a small artful cameo (and I usually hate him) where he creates a *character* that is different from himself. You actually have to blink to make sure it is him.

Which brings us to Matt Damon, who mysteriously does not appear in this film. Why De Niro cast the Damon puppet from Trey Parker and Matt Stone's ""Team America: World Police"" for the lead role will perhaps forever remain a mystery in annuls of Movianna (perhaps budget constraints is the explanation).

The Damon puppet gives a credible but wooden performance in its limited, expressionless, range. And perhaps this was De Niro's goal. But the difficulty is the blank grain of the barely painted static wood block simply doesn't point to any interior conflict that is the entire subtext and purpose of the film. Other critics have projected their own emotional reactions to the *script* and *plot* onto the puppet's performance, but even with clever lighting and muted shadows (all stolen from Riefenstahl and German expressionism) the puppet remains, well, a puppet. Its ceaseless repetition of the one line ""Matt Damon"" got pretty tiresome, as were the 50's style half-horn rim glasses superglued to its ears. De Niro simply went overboard in trying to cast for a wooden performance, but we can suppose he did not want to take the risk of having a flesh and blood actor who might comprehend what was going on.

Which leads to the other bad things in the film (a list of endless clich's begins here): WASPs are emotionless, secret societies are evil, wealth is abused, cripples and blacks are not worthy of the love of gods, government is there for the privileged, WASPS are actually cyrpto-Nat-zees, women aren't worthy of respect and are nothing but breed cows and catchers mitts for our genetic sputum, etc.

But the biggest, unresolved, and forever bizarre bug-a-boo of Hollywood is a thesis that is paradoxical and has mutually exclusive axioms:  The CIA is so powerful it can do anything and it is simultaneously an organization of incompetent buffoons motivated to do foolish counterproductive and damaging things. The Good Shepherd manages to make the case for both ideas and as far as I can tell, is serious.

I really could not stop laughing. This is the biggest pot of poo I have ever seen, and if there is a single creative or original idea in the whole mess of twaddle, I'll be flummoxed if I could find it. Like the boy happily and energetically digging through a pile of manure expecting to find a pony at the bottom of it, I kept watching. But nope, as the credits rolled it became flabbergastingly evident that De Niro was serious and this was his real expression and intent.

Your time would be better spent making shadow puppets with your hands and naming lefty ""clich"" and righty ""Jolie"" unless you, like myself and ""Sprockets"" Dieter say:

""Did you mean for me to scream?""",1186531200,8,5316,4.966216216216216
2752064,3,B000MXPE7Y,"The Good Shepherd might have been a great shepherd, if only this attractively shot film had been a good deal shorter. There's a terrific hour and forty five minutes buried somewhere in the two hours-plus here. Witness the beginning of the CIA, from its pre-WWII inception to its near-unravelling in the 1961 Bay of Pigs fiasco. That's a long stretch of years, and this very good motion picture makes you feel the length of every one of them.

In spite of its crippling length, this movie has a wonderfully understated performance by Matt Damon, and lots of good cast support. If the guy Damon plays weren't such an insufferable family jerk, he might be sympathetic, even likeable, in his quiet, no-nonsense CIA role.

It seems, if you believe that this movie is true, that our intelligence agency's problems did not begin with the current administration. Here is political and geopolitical scandal at its most bizarre, intense, and improbable. Vastly entertaining--again, if only the length of the presentation weren't so vast.

2752065,4,B000MXPE7Y,"As many have stated, this is not a fast-paced, sexy, James Bond type movie with car chases, explosions and buxom starlets. This is a complex, intricate film that will reward those who follow along, although the almost three hour length will be a bit much for most. In describing the ideal candidate for an intelligence officer, one character states that attention to detail and the ability to sort truth from misdirection is paramount. The same attributes could describe the ideal viewer, let alone the ability to deduce the outcome. In ways it's reminiscent of The Conversation, with failure, guilt. trust and choice as major themes that are sometimes played out in ironic twists of fate.

Matt Damon's performance might seem wooden, but it's the few moments when humanity does creep through his stoic front that are the tell-tale heart of this movie...what at first appears to be a shield becomes reality over time. It's a difficult character to play but he handles it well (aging makeup aside - or was DeNiro saying that ""nothing ever changes""?).

Many comments here rake Angelina Jolie over the coals, but I don't know why. Her nuanced performance was excellent, from the flirtatious child of privilege toying with her beau (her insipid question at the beach tryst shows he desperation for an emotion she has never been surrounded by and doesn't understand) to the confused and later frustrated wife who realizes she ultimately is surrounded by deception.

The cast is filled with superlative actors, although some don't get beyond a few small cameos. Billy Crudup, John Turturro, Alec Baldwin and William Hurt are very good in support, as is Oleg Shtefanko as Damon's KGB counterpart. However, Michael Gambon is exceptional - an Oscar nomination would not have been out of line.

The pace is methodical, and DeNiro's decision to jump timelines might exhaust the patience of those seeking to follow the plot. But if you watch closely and listen carefully, you'll find the truth...although much like for the movie's characters, it's not always what you expected it to be.",1186272000,2,2074,5.020348837209302
2752066,3,B000MXPE7Y,"The Robert DeNiro directed ""The Good Shepherd"" was an overly ambitious, 167 minute film that chronicled the formulation of the CIA through the eyes of the humorless Edward Wilson played by Matt Damon.  Damon playing the eventual CIA head of counter intelligence was one of a star studded cast that couldn't save this plodding film which could have been cropped by at least 30 minutes.  Not only was the film editing questionable but the musical score often times drowned out the dialogue.  The characters were not particularly well developed diminishing their ability to evoke empathy for them.  Venerable veteran actors like Joe Pesci, Timothy Hutton and DeNiro himself were given toothless cameos that didn't showcase their abilities.

DeNiro who also starred in the film as General Bill Sullivan, a prominent architect of the CIA, used a flashback format to weave his tale.  Damon seen in the film's present, 1961, takes partial responsibility for the Cuban Bay of Pigs fiasco.  We are then time warped back to the late 1930's to Damon's induction into Yale University's prestigious Skull and Bones fraternal order.  His privileged background allows him to travel in the upper echelons of society.  He is soon recruited by FBI agent Sam Murach played by Alec Baldwin to spy on his thesis professor Fredericks played by Michael Gambon who is sympathetic to Nazism.

Soon after being cajoled into marriage as a result of a sexual fling resulting in pregnancy with loose society girl Clover Russell played by a miscast Angelina Jolie, Damon enlists with the intelligence arm of the military. He spends 6 years in Europe separated from his wife and son running the O.S.S. in London ably assisted by John Turturro playing Ray Brocco. On and on the story goes.  The O.S.S. becomes the CIA and Damon rises in the ranks of the intelligence hierarchy.

The central theme to the story is Damon's dedication to the service and his country while eschewing his family.  What goes around comes around as Damon's son, Edward Jr. now grown up and played by Eddie Redmayne also joins the CIA putting Damon in the crosshairs of his Soviet counterpart Ulysses played by Oleg Shtefanko.",1185667200,,2169,4.975069252077562
2752067,3,B000MXPE7Y,"I had some mixed feelings about this one.  It was obviously intended as a ""serious"" movie, and certainly pulls that off credibly.  On the plus side was the all-star cast, including Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie, Robert DeNiro (who also produced the film), Alec Baldwin, and William Hurt, among others.  Even Joe Pesci makes an appearance toward the end.  However, Jolie's and DeNiro's roles were a bit marginalized for actors who are accustomed to being the star.  Also, Damon seemed (in my humble opinion) to be miscast for the role of Edward Wilson.  He simply looked too young to be believable as a middle-aged man with a twenty-something son, and the birth-control glasses and fedora weren't able to compensate adequately.

As to the story itself, I saw it as tracing not only the birth of the CIA, but the dehumanization of Edward Wilson, which culminated in the closing scene with the revelation of his father's secret.  As a spy drama, it is predictably full of intrigue, deception and betrayal.  Wilson is told over and over by other spies that he can trust no one, yet ultimately it is a lesson he must learn through hard experience.  All the while, the viewer watches with a vague sympathy as Wilson's life slips further and further away, as he is dragged ever deeper into the dark web of Cold War espionage.  Yet he is a willing captive.

Damon's role was at once central yet maddeningly flat, with relatively little dialogue and a lot of silent, intense staring.  The storyline bounced back and forth between the main tale of exposing a mole who leaked the plans for the Bay of Pigs operation, and tracing Wilson's biography as a college student turned OSS operative in WW2, and later CIA counterintelligence officer.  One must read the subtitles at the beginning of each scene to keep track of the chronology, but even with that aid it can be very difficult to track this subtle and often highly nuanced narrative.  An example is the meeting between Wilson and Modin regarding Edward Jr.'s fiance.  One must read carefully between the lines of their dialogue to appreciate the subsequent scenes involving the young lady's ""mishap.""

In short, this movie is worth seeing once -- maybe twice if you really want to be able to understand better some of the more subtle plot twists.  However, I found it to be too long, a bit dry, and not especially entertaining.  I personally wouldn't waste the time on a second viewing.",1185580800,3,2427,4.776978417266187
2752068,5,B000MXPE7Y,"This is the story of espionage and how the OSS - later to be known as the CIA - came to be. Matt Damon, plays the lead role of Edward Wilson, a shy young man with little to say for himself who becomes a member of the secret society known as Skull & Bones whilst a student at Yale.
Wilson loves poetry and developes a special relationship with his tutor (Michael Gambon) whom he eventually betrays when he is made aware that the tutor is a Nazi Spy. This betrayal sets the pattern of what is to become Edward Wilson's life,a man who totally subjagates his own emotions in order to put his country first.
He marries a woman (Angelina Jolie,in a minor role) he does not love as she is expecting his child, and unbeknownst to her, he requests to be sent on an OSS overseas mission,which he leaves to go to the day after his marriage.
He lives in a world without any real human contact, unable to trust any of his colleagues, and his wife and son at home are strangers to him.
Joe Pesci plays Joseph Palmi, an underworld figure very reminiscent of Carlos Marcello in a book I've just finished reading (Mafia King Fish), when Cuban gambling casinos are shut down by Fidel Castro costing the Mafia millions in lost revenue.
This of course later leads to mob involvement in the Bay of Pigs and the attempted assassination of Castro.
The cast is full of top names and great performances, especially from Damon,DeNiro, Joe Pesci,Tammy Blanchard,Michael Gambon and William Hurt.
The film is very long (168 minutes) and is slow moving, unlike most movies made today, and it requires concentration, patience, and an appreciation of actors absorbed in their roles. This is a film bereft of physical violence,or indeed special effects of any kind.

2752072,4,B000MXPE7Y,"Ambitious, star-studded, and lengthy, The Good Shepherd purports to give us a sense of how the CIA operated during the Cold War and how it affected those who devoted themselves to the cause.  So it is that, via a series of flashbacks, we meet an intelligent young Yale student named Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), watch as he is recruited into the service of American intelligence, joins the O.S.S. during WWII, helps found the nascent CIA in the 1950s, and goes about doing the thankless, extremely difficult job of keeping America safe through foreign crises, particularly those involving Castro's Cuba in the 1960s.  It's not an expose on the CIA - which it actually deals with quite even-handedly, especially in today's day and age - as it principally focuses on the personal story of this one individual and what might be called his dehumanization at the hands of his sometimes sinister career.

Unfortunately, there is a major (but not fatal) flaw at the very heart of the film.  Obviously, a man in Edward Wilson's position must be a cold and calculating man, but his characterization ventures far beyond stoic into the realms of the robotic.  Even the personal glimpses intended to get us past the emotional wall that defines him lack insight and feeling.  We see through his eyes, but we never really get a sense of his inward self.  I also had a problem seeing Wilson as the experienced, upper level CIA man he became because no effort seemed to go in to making Matt Damon appear any older as his character aged; he looks the same in the 1960s as he did in 1939.  Come on, put a few grey hairs in there or something; it takes more than a fedora to make me believe he's a quarter of a century older.  Damon just never looks the part of an older Edward Wilson, and that really impacted - and not in a good way - my perspective of the entire movie.  Additionally, even though this is not a factual account of CIA history, the film's attempt to deflect any blame from John F. Kennedy for refusing to grant air support to the otherwise sitting ducks storming the beaches at the Bay of Pigs really rubbed me the wrong way.

I think it helps to have some knowledge of the historical and political background of events touched upon in this movie, especially the dark stain that is the Bay of Pigs fiasco.  That is really the lynchpin of the film's story, as one of the reasons for the failure slowly causes Wilson's personal and private lives to collide and truly test his mettle - with more than a little help from the helping hands of a formidable KGB intelligence officer.  What should be an excruciatingly painful decision dredges up virtually no emotion in the man, however - although the same can't be said of Wilson's sometimes boisterous wife (Angelina Jolie).  The ending doesn't pack much of a punch either, further pointing out the film's quite obvious deficiencies in character development.  Personally, I found the movie pretty interesting throughout, but that was largely because of my interest in intelligence operations and Cold War history.  If you could care less about those subjects, you probably won't enjoy the movie at all because it simply fails to forge any kind of emotional bond between you and the characters.",1185235200,,3236,4.700884955752213

I love movies that involve your complete attention and have to be watched more than once to catch everything- but this movie was terrible.  It jumped around way too much and left little explanations for any actions that were performed.  Unless you knew exactly what was going on during which year, and I'm assuming most people don't, then you become confused and aggravated trying desperatly to figure out what they are talking about.  My friend was even more aggravated than I was.

I don't recommend the movie if you are looking to be educated on the birth of the CIA.

The imagery in the film was strong and compelling, as was the subject matter. For a contemporary film, I think they did a pretty good job of splicing historical aspects of the US's conflicts over the past 70 years, into a fictional (as far as I know?) film/story.

With that said, the characters were poorly developed, and the film itself lacked any real emotion. I think the best way to describe the flaw in this film is that I was aware I was watching a film - a good film makes you forget you're even watching a film, and you effortlessly empathize with the characters. The poor writing was directly responsible for this. The film was predictable as well - (spoiler warning) - you knew that the brother was going to tell Matt Damon that Angelina Jolie was pregnant was soon as you saw him on the beach - and, you knew that the poetry professor was going to come on to Matt Damon as soon as he said 'I'd like to see you in my office'...The formulaic Hollywood film factory at its best/worst.",1182816000,3,1110,4.311004784688995

2752085,5,B000MXPE7Y,"Some reviewers have complained of lack of action and a dull main character; of a man with no obvious feelings, dedicated only to secrecy in the service of `The Company'. If you want gung-ho, bullet dodging heroes then Tom Clancy and Harrison Ford are the guys for you. If you want to know where the men who are now running the USA (and hence the world) originated, and how they took a stranglehold on power, then watch this film.  It is an intelligent account of the early days of the CIA: an extension of a rich old boy's network that may have begun with honourable intentions, but soon became a cabal, protecting vested interests, and now views its purpose solely to nurture the interests of one percent of one country's citizens, at the expense of just about everyone else on the planet.  If that takes grey, violent men, obsessively secretive to the point of destroying their own families, then that's a price they willingly pay.

The film succeeds admirably. De Niro maintains intelligence (pun intended) throughout, without pandering to target audiences or oversimplifying in case `they' won't understand it. Two or three viewings may be necessary to absorb everything here. Like Emilio Estevez's Bobby, I think this is a `where it all started to go wrong' film, inviting comparisons with today. As a Russian defector, at the end of his tether under torture says:

`Soviet power is a myth. A great show. But there are no spare parts. Nothing is working. It's nothing but painted rust. But you. You need to keep the Russian myth alive to maintain your military-industrial complex. Your system depends on Russia being perceived as a threat. It is not a threat. It was never a threat. It never will be a threat. It is a rotten, bloated cow.'

Even at two hours and forty minutes, I didn't want the film to end. The action, or conflict is unrelenting.  Thought provoking, clever, entertaining, well-acted and genuine. An oddity, in other words.",1182643200,9,1946,4.794029850746269
2752086,4,B000MXPE7Y,"Directed by Robert DiNiro, this is the fictionalized story of the beginnings of the CIA.  Matt Damon is cast as Robert Wilson, a composite character who believed in America and closed his eyes to some of its abuses in the belief that he was doing the best he could for his country.  We see him first as a young man joining the Skull and Bones society at Yale, a secret society steeped in tradition which shaped the lives of many of America's leaders.  The CIA is a secret society too, and as the film progresses the audience sees how it shapes its members.  There's a code of right and wrong here, and Wilson makes choices about what he sees as ""right"".  He marries Angelina Jolie because she is pregnant, but her life is lonely and unfulfilled because he never loves her.  His relationship with his son as well as everyone else has a wide variety of strings attached.  And, in the, end, Robert Wilson learns the price of a life filled with righteous deception.

Matt Damon's acting ability is flawless in this film.  He embodies his character completely.  The storyline however, is extremely confusing and I suspect it was by design.  The audience often does not know what is happening or why.  This soon grows tedious to watch however, especially as the film is more than three hours long and it is impossible to be sure of who the bad guys and the good guys are.  As a result, I was bored a lot and even though this is clearly a worthwhile film, there are lots of problems with the fuzzy plot.

For many, the appeal of excellent acting and a critique of the CIA's role in America since the 1960s will result in a satisfying film experience.  It wasn't quite enough for me however.",1181865600,9,1683,4.472131147540984

2752088,3,B000MXPE7Y,"""Good Shepherd""  is an epic story about Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), a CIA agent in the cold war era of the '60s. The movie goes back and forth in time from the 20s to the 60s starting from Wilson's college days at Yale, where he joins the society of Skulls and Bones and then gets mentored to perform counterintelligence tasks.  The movie is interwoven with multiple flashbacks, which I didn't like and felt wasn't really necessary. Every director has to follow the nonlinear timeline technique these days just to make it look like an ""intelligent"" movie. In spite of boasting the best ensemble cast seen in a long time,  the movie is very long and will easily put you to sleep after the first hour. The pacing is just too slow and makes it hard to concentrate for almost 3 hours. With better editing,  ""Shepherd"" could have been a front runner at the Oscars.",1181865600,3,859,4.558441558441558

2752092,2,B000MXPE7Y,"Robert De Niro's extraordinary talents as an actor need no elaboration here. With regard to De Niro's  abilities as director, it is useful to compare A Bronx Tale, his last effort in 1993 with The Good Shepherd, his second film. The former displays evidence of masterly and imaginative directorial gifts that brought to life a story replete with power, violence, poignancy, insight and humor.  The success of A Bronx Tale would emerge from out of the matrix of De Niro's immensely successful association with Martin Scorsese and from actor/writer Chaz Palmieri's wonderful screenplay.  Throughout A Bronx Tale, De Niro displayed what seemed to be an innate and thorough grasp of  New York's organized crime scene.

In disappointing contrast, The Good Shepherd stands as a pretentious and  insipid film. Dark and complex aspects of CIA operations worldwide are either treated superficially or are totally obfuscated. On the surface, the premise of The Good Shepherd suggests a work poised to deliver a timely and provocative look at America's foreign policy in the post World War II era, one spanning several decades that focuses upon the conduct of CIA operations worldwide. Matt Damon is Edward Wilson, a dull Yale Skull and Crossbones alumnus recruited by CIA founder William Donovan and played by De Niro. Angelina Jolie plays Clover, Wilson's beautiful and frustrated wife. Alec Baldwin and William Hurt deliver fine performances as does Joe Peschi - whom we encounter very briefly and memorably (as in A Bronx Tale) playing mobster Joseph Palmi.

DeNiro uses flashbacks throughout the film in a manner that irritates and confuses. As the film's screenwriter, Eric Roth,(whose earlier works include Forest Gump and Munich), delivers a sanitized and vapid script that fails to shed light on critical events and issues underlying US policy worldwide. For example, in mentioning the CIA coup in Guatemala, Roth completely ignores the role played by corporate interests such as United Fruit, (now Chiquita Brands International). As men with strong links to United Fruit, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and CIA Director Allen Dulles supported plans for a coup that overthrew the democratically elected President Jacobo Arbenz who sought to nationalize lands held by United Fruit. In the process, America devastated Guatemala's hope of securing a future based on justice and progress. Roth's screenplay adopts the fiction claimed by the Eisenhower administration in 1954 that Arbenz served as an agent of Soviet-styled communism and therefore his removal was essential to the national security of the United States.  In no part of this film do we see evidence of the integration of vital literature pertaining to CIA global actions such as Miles Copeland's The Game of Nations, William Crane Eveland's Ropes of Sand, Phillip Agee's Inside the Company or John Stockwell's In Search of Enemies. Roth does refer to certain aspects of  America's Bay of Pigs fiasco, but affords us so little  historical information about the subject that we are unable to analyze it in an informed and critical way.

In assessing The Good Shepherd, one should bear in mind  Samuel Johnson's wise adage that ""patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel."" In The Good Shepherd - Edward Wilson -  emerges in the Roth script as an unfortunate and bland global automaton who clings to career and class while placing considerations of state interest far above that of family.  Like a character in a Sinclair Lewis novel, he remains oblivious to the moral conundrums inherent in the implementation of CIA policies.

Sadly, we are afforded so little information pertaining to critical issues, events, countries, people, and corporations  that a true philosophical quandary involving the main character and the goals he pursues never emerges. And the script contains none of the depth or insight of a Sinclair Lewis novel. Alas, in the final analysis, we care very little about Wilson and all we are left with is a disjointed glimpse into the life of a global functionary who is devoid of soul, and we are none the better for having made such a pointless journey.",1181347200,6,4139,5.155223880597015

Hopefully, De Niro will continue to explore this fascinating saga in his next directorial project.",1181347200,29,511,5.011764705882353
2752094,5,B000MXPE7Y,"It's amazing that this film is so highly regarded, especially since we have Matt Damon as the lead character. Damon isn't known for his exciting acting abilities (with the exception of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Good-Will-Hunting/dp/0788814664/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Good Will Hunting</a>&nbsp;which I consider his quasi-breakout role).

I say ""limited"" because it was the other characters and screenplay that brought him recognition more than his own abilities (try imagining Saving Private Ryan without Tom Hanks or The Departed without Leonardo DiCaprio and you'll see what I mean.) So I wasn't drawn to this flick simply because I knew Damon was our main man. But I was wonderfully surprised.

Damon was the perfect choice for this role, and that isn't necessarily a compliment. His portrayal of Edward Wilson is flat, ineffectual, and unremarkable, just like the character was supposed to be. Just like many of Damon's previous portrayals. It is this absurd, unemotional character that drives the entire film, and thanks to director/actor Robert DeNiro's relentless pursuit of this movie (it was his pet project for over ten years) we have a gem.

Beginning with Robert Kennedy's disastrous Bay of Pigs debacle, the film shows Ed Wilson (Damon) trying to overcome an American/Cuban historical event that many find shameful. The CIA had a leak somewhere that blew the entire assault, and Wilson has to find out who and how. It will take him back to the very beginnings of the CIA, pre-WWII, and then slowly catch up to the1960's.

Battling the Cold War with a very worthy Russian opponent, Ed must come to grips with the death of his father (who was an OSS spy in WWI), the loveless relationship with his wife (played by Angelina Jolie), and what he's prepared to do for his son (Eddi Redmayne) when he learns of ignorant betrayal from within.

The film really looks at the development of the CIA, how it came to be, what spying is REALLY like (not James Bond-ish), and one man's unwavering support for his country. Dark corners are everywhere, including Ed Wilson's own home. Life and business blur. Separating the man from the mission becomes impossible. A panoply of scenes greets each moment of Ed's life, from the shadowy corners of Post-WWII Berlin to the recesses of his home sanctuary. It's an incredible display with truly gripping photography and a frightening descent into the world of phantom spies.

A powerhouse cast graces the screen, with fine performances from such greats as John Turturro (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thirteen-Conversations-About-One-Thing/dp/B000GBK904/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thirteen Conversations About One Thing</a>), Joe Pesci and William Hurt (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Syriana/dp/B000F7CMRM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Syriana</a>).

Surprisingly THE GOOD SHEPHERD has made it up to one of my all-time favorite spy films. But a warning call must be sound here. This isn't your typical spy flick. It won't be for everyone.

From beginning to end this riveting movie shows impeccable period cinematography depictions, from the late 1930's through the early 1960's.

The movie purports to be a fictionalized account of the early days of the CIA and its World War II predecessor, the OSS.  In the corpus of the film, it is difficult to determine what is fact and what is fiction.  Much of the presentation is simply implausible.  All of it is morally bankrupt.  And the movie is far too long, especially given that it is not particularly interesting.

Matt Damon is cast as what appears to be a composite character, intended to represent some of the original CIA/OSS men.  He performs reasonably well in a poorly conceived role.  But the casting of the stunning and luminous Angelina Jolie as the stay-at-home wife who interests him not is patently absurd.  Be serious, folks.  Does Ms. Jolie, in her prime, really bore you?

The early scenes of the Skull and Bones connection to the CIA are worthwhile in a historical sense.  But do we really need to see older Bonesmen urinating on the intitiates to appreciate their depravity?  We think not.

This movie is far too long.  It is not well made.  The movie employs seemingly random flashbacks that make it nearly impossible to follow.  It is a morally bankrupt presentation that it is best ignored.  Robert De Niro should stick to acting.  This film is a major artistic failure.",1180742400,14,1333,4.643776824034335

He soon finds he can trust no one but himself, but before we are accustomed to Matt Damon's bookish characterization of a serious minded government agent, (he's described as a tight-""behind"" with no sense of humor), we can't help but wonder why he was so aggresively sought out by the CIA as a junior member. He's first seen, in drag, make-up, wig and falsetto voice, on a college theatrical stage singing in a Gilbert and Sullivan opera. He is, (gulp) a poetry student, and his father committed suicide with the distinction of being a traitor to the U.S. government. These should not be high marks on a CIA score card. But without further explanation he's sought after as if he's the ideal candidate. The rest of the film is a series of knee-deep espionage, and double agent revelations that apparently astounded the filmmakers, (musical score soars), but which could be found as passive page-turners in a mediocre paperback spy novel, (watch out for the brunette with the 'hearing aid' and eastern European accent who asks you over for dinner; wink, wink, nudge, nudge). The film goes on for three hours and is missing a narrative drive despite some dramatic pitstops along the way; Angelina Jolie is quite effective as Damon's socialite wife, and the Bay of Pigs segment seems an accurate portrait of the blundering by the U.S. government, but THE GOOD SHEPHERD mostly shepherds along as if searching a landmark statement it never reveals.",1180483200,,2046,4.865329512893982
2752101,3,B000MXPE7Y,"As a filmmaker, Robert DeNiro shows the influence of his generation of great directors like Scorsese and Coppola with this epic-length 2006 film. In fact, there is a certain structural similarity to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Godfather/dp/B0001NBNB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Godfather</a>&nbsp;in DeNiro's careful unfolding of the time-spanning story penned by screenwriter Eric Roth. The plot focuses on a fictionalized account of the first twenty years of the CIA as seen through the experiences of one agent named Edward Wilson, an intentionally cryptic study in excessive self-control which makes him ideal for his career. Ironically, the main problem with the film is the stoic coldness of the central character for which DeNiro and Roth cannot seem to find a voice that would make the story resonate. There is little sense of a personal journey for Wilson, even though there are hints of it beginning with his father's suicide, which is used as a leitmotif throughout the story.

Another frustration of the film is the constant time-jumping between the fallout over the failed Bay of Pigs mission in 1961 and key episodes in Wilson's earlier years. The technique doesn't make the drama any more interesting than it really is. Unfortunately there is no getting around the fact that despite the handsome production detail, the movie is a slog at 248 minutes and quite often, an amazing bore. DeNiro has assembled a can't-miss cast, including himself as a pre-CIA operative, but for the most part, they are stranded by a script consisting of coded exchanges and predictable dialogue, the latter most prevalent in the domestic scenes. Matt Damon does all he can as the poker-faced Wilson, but he is given little latitude to elicit empathy for his character.

While she starts out with her fiery persona intact, Angelina Jolie has a progressively smaller role as Wilson's increasingly embittered wife Clover merely defined by how shut off she is from Wilson's clandestine profession. DeNiro inexplicably does not age either Damon or Jolie with any conviction over the course of the story, and there is an oddly unsettling dynamic when they are shown as the parents of a fully grown son. Better among the huge cast are William Hurt as a lifelong mentor; Tammy Blanchard as Wilson's true love, a hearing-impaired coed with whom he is reunited years later; Billy Crudup as a rather fey British counterspy; Alec Baldwin as a covert FBI agent; and John Turturro as Wilson's no-nonsense colleague. The 2007 DVD is short on extras, as it just contains seven deleted scenes of little additional interest.

The run time of this film is almost 3 hours, but the story line and suspense is such that you stay glued to the screen and at no time does it lose your interest.

2752106,1,B000MXPE7Y,"I was very optimistic when I watched this film. I expected a good or excellent movie. WOW was I wrong. First of all, I was totally baffled by the main character, played by Matt Damon, as he was  lifeless and only had like three lines in the whole movie. This is the only movie I've ever seen where the main character didn't speak.  Why were women attracted to him? I've never been attracted to mutes myself. Also the plot was a confusing, jumbled mess. I think this film committed the worst crime possible-it didn't give the viewer a reason to care about the characters or the plot. It was also a very boring film. Considering all the critics' hype I was expecting at least a marginally enjoyable film. Alas, not so.

Also, wierdly, the deleted scenes are also very long and boring

I hope Ocean's 13 and The Bourne Ultimatum will be more enjoyable. But I'm not holding my breath.",1179532800,7,880,4.48125
2752107,4,B000MXPE7Y,"I really enjoyed this movie.  It was long, it was slow, but it was very interesting.  I had previously read in historical biographies about the men who formed the CIA after WWII, and this film seemed to follow the information that I have learned.  I was quite surprised, however, by the films direction.  I always find it odd that spies for western nations could end up being spies for the Soviets.  Never ceases to amaze me.  Anyway, this film left me only slightly disappointed and mostly happy with what I saw.  Angelina Jolie could have stayed home, as while her role was important, it could have been played by anybody.  Her performance was rather flat.  Matt Damon was his typical Matt Damon self, that is right on target.  He is a blossoming and amazing actor, and I'm sure that we will continue to see stellar stuff from Matt.  Robert De Niro, who directs this film, made a couple of cameo appearances; it's always good to see De Niro.  Joe Pesci graced the screen for a few minutes, and I found it chilling how he was so much like himself.  I have to say that Joe Pesci is one of the most consistent character actors around, he is always Joe Pesci.  He'd make a great serial killer in the next Hannibal movie.  I was quite surprised by Billy Crudup's role; hard to imagine him with shortish hair.

Good film, great writing.  It has a Godfather like touch to it.  In fact, it has that Sopranos, Godfather, Deadwood kind of ending where all of the bad guys get tied up in a nice bow and ribbon.",1179446400,3,1501,4.416058394160584
2752108,3,B000MXPE7Y,"Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson, a sensitive and intelligent poetry major at Yale.  Upon his graduation, he is invited to be one of the first agents in the fledgling CIA.  At this time he has a tender romance with a young, hearing-impaired woman, but a moment's dalliance with a friend's sister (played by Angelina Jolie) results in her pregnancy and their marriage.  Edward leaves her to go overseas to England and thus begins a distant and emotionless marriage and fatherhood.  As the years go by, Edward becomes totally remote and secretive, stung by the cruelty and treachery that he has witnessed.  The role of Edward Wilson is a difficult one to play and Matt Damon does a credible job with it.  There are problems with the script which mar the film, and the constant flashbacks are distracting and confusing.  The premise of the film is a very interesting one, the birth and development of the CIA as seen through the life of one of its early agents, but the movie is cold and emotionless like the lead character, and is told in a monotone.  The length of the film only adds to the deadening effect.  The movie makes a noble effort to tell a story, but it falls short of its potential.",1179446400,2,1191,4.580188679245283

Secondly, I have let several friends borrow the DVD since receiving it and have given them all the same advice.  Make sure to pay attention to the timeline.  There are several references to dates that if not noticed make the movie hard to follow.

While the subject matter:  The birth of the CIA, is an interesting and exciting one, the Director did not help his actors develop their characters.  Matt Damon was credible, much like Di Caprio in the Aviator, but knowing something about Angelton, like Hughes, on which the lead characters in the two movies were based, makes the viewer really stretch to see the people behind the portrayals.  Baldwin is good...as are most of the actors...including Jolie, who was slightly miscast as a forgotten wife.  I mean, who can forget Jolie!!  The movie holds your interest. It makes you want to see and know more, which is good.  Someone who knows about James Jesus Angelton, the master spy catcher, might feel a little cheated by this kind of one sided look at a pretty dull guy, which is bad.  Again, you will like it.

2752123,4,B000MXPE7Y,"Ingeniously written, with superlative acting and a masterful score, this sinister drama delves into the mysterious and ruinous influences the CIA has on the lives of their dedicated operatives. A slightly disconcerting timeline doesn't deter from enjoying the crafty elements of betrayal, suspicion and sacrifice that permeate this Cold War espionage epic.

Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) is a well-rounded Yale graduate who is quickly recruited into the newly formed Central Intelligence Agency due to his desired qualities of discretion and commitment. Suspicion and paranoia gradually overrun his once steadfast belief in American values, as he rapidly becomes a chief operative and an integral part of the system. Engulfed in distrust and intent on combating his KGB rival, Wilson consequently sacrifices his ideals and his family in the pursuit of his career.

The Good Shepherd achieves what films of this length usually attempt and rarely succeed at, and that is to delve into the inner-workings of its characters and explore character development to its most complex and absolute fullest. Meaningful events and poignant dialogue work beautifully to immerse the viewer into the traumatic lives of those involved in the secretive CIA and its shaky roots. Most prominently is the character study of the fictitious Edward Wilson, whose dynamic rise and fall parallels films such as The Godfather. Although they both fail in preventing what seems to be inevitable destiny, Wilson manages to wash away guilt, feeling and perhaps even acknowledgement of his situation and the sacrifices made to preserve the job that keeps him in an ominous stranglehold. Inhumanly he acts according to its will, half conscious of the consequences to his family and himself, and yet he relishes in the accomplishments that lead to absolute solitude. So many of his ill deeds are attempts at righting other wrongs, and he is perpetually fixed in compromises, sacrifices and decisions that aid the agency. His choices are those of ill-fate and necessity; he is capable of love, but unable to display it fruitfully, and like his father, negatively impacts the lives of his wife and son. A truly tragic character, the viewer is made aware of his hopeless cycle throughout the film, but only at the conclusion do we see the shell of the man chewed up and spit out and left in reflection; he fails to accept the realizations of how his choices affect those closest to him, even though such repercussions are unintentional. The intense themes of paranoia, suspicion, and betrayal are wonderfully conjured up through masterfully dramatic performances by rising star Matt Damon, and equally stunning supporting actors Angelina Jolie, William Hurt, and Robert De Niro. John Turturro plays operative Ray Brocco, another outstanding supporting performance, who menacingly and efficiently carries out his duty; he retains a sense of humor at his inception into the agency, but gradually develops into an efficiently torturous henchman. Robert De Niro, who also directs, makes a short appearance, as does Joe Pesci, who has been curiously out of the spotlight for a very long time, garnering a high billing even though his character appears for only one scene...

2752124,4,B000MXPE7Y,"The trailers for ""The Good Shepherd"" looked really exciting; lots of action, etc. Apparently, all 2 minutes of action were packed into that trailer. This is not to say the film isn't worthy; it IS...on many levels. Matt Damon really is one of our current best actors, and he commands attention. The confusing time-shifts weren't helpful; don't know if that was a problem of director de Niro or the editor or writer. There's a terrifc cast, though Jolie was sorely miscast. Alec Baldwin & Damon had some good banter, as they did in ""The Departed"". I could watch a film with only those two, and be more entertained than all of ""The Good Shepherd"". The historical accuracy of this telling of the founding of the CIA is questionable, and putting it in the same league as Carol Reed's ""The Third Man"", or Demme's ""Silence of the Lambs"" cannot allow me to put this on my list of favorites. I admire Matt Damon a lot, and he's fine, but the overall result was disappointing for me. Apparently, I missed something, including the 2 hours of my life that were taken up, and I'm too old to waste the time.",1178755200,,1094,4.53030303030303
2752125,5,B000MXPE7Y,The first time I saw the film I was left confused. It took 3 viewings to really understand and then I cried. I really think fewer actors would have made the confusion less. I do believe this is a very very good film but again unless you are exceptional at following a script you will have to allow another viewing or two. I did really love it though and it will always leave me guessing about the subject and WHAT IS REALLY THE TRUTH behind the curtains. Finally this film reconfirmed my doubts of our government's honesty and their ideas and actions.,1178755200,3,551,4.411764705882353
2752126,3,B000MXPE7Y,"Given everything that the Good Shepherd has going for it on paper alone, saying the overall result is disappointing is saying it a bit lightly.  Robert De Niro's ""pet project"" and first directorial effort since A Bronx Tale, the Good Shepherd follows the life of the brilliant Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) and the beginnings and origins of the CIA.  Throughout the film, we witness the career triumps of Wilson as well as his personal failures that haunt him throughout the years.  The multi-layered, fact based script justifies the nearly three hour running time, but the overall effect of the Good Shepherd just doesn't perform nearly as well as it should.  Damon is wooden to say the least, while Angelina Jolie's talent is wasted as Wilson's long suffering wife.  There are notable supporting actors as well, including De Niro himself, Alec Baldwin, John Turturro, William Hurt, Timothy Hutton, Billy Crudup, Michael Gambon, 2001's Keir Dullea, and the great Joe Pesci (making his first screen appearance in almost a decade), but none of them are around long enough to make much impact.  Not to mention that the deliberately slow pacing of the film can really be difficult to sit through, and while the Good Shepherd isn't a bad film one bit, it is a disappointment nonetheless.  All in all, fans of fact based spy films or De Niro should definitely give the Good Shepherd a look, but be well forewarned before entering.",1178755200,2,1422,4.9

2752128,4,B000MXPE7Y,"For me this movie was difficult to understand, except at a superficial level, on first viewing.  However, it was attractive enough for me to go back a second time and watch it.  It had many vectors to it that one could follow.  The one that has currently fixed my attention and that i see as the most important, perhaps unintended, most important none the less, is the cause and consequence of early abandonment of

children by their fathers due to monetary, business, military or other committments, i.e. distractions from what is ultimately the most protective of a society, service to one's country aside.  Do our small children perceive that we abandoned them when they needed us most and if they do perceive that, whether we intend it or not, what will be the consequences of that perceived abandonment in their lives?

  The consequences of Edward Jr's perceived abandonment by his father during the child's earliest years was possible betrayal of his country(because of his seeking out the love and acceptance that he needed), the killing of that sought after love (his wife to be) and the accompanying killing of Edward Sr's unborn grandchild, unacceptable consequences of the ""call to duty"" or service to one's country.

When I saw the trailer in December 2006 I was looking forward to seeing thi movie about the birth of the CIA. Unfortunately it is way too slow-moving and somehow not that interesting in parts. Matt Damon is good in the role of a future spy-master who is recruited after studying at Yale. He then manages to meet and marry the sister of one of his upper-class friends. How he then manages to become such a grey and rather uninterseting character afterwards is more a problem of the script and probably of the directing. Indeed, while the start is confusing, the rest is worse because it actually manages to get uninteresting.

2752139,3,B000MXPE7Y,"You can take the title of this review in two ways: 1) The star referencing Matt Damon's character portrayal of a government agent so loyal to his country that nothing comes a close second to the duty and honor he serves with. And 2) the star referencing the CIA and literally how it came into existence.

I've seen some quotes directly or indirectly suggesting that The Good Shepard is ""the best spy movie ever made"". That may be true if you like a movie that is as long and wide as its aspect ratio with very little action.

And the lack of action was deliberate on DiNiro's part (DiNiro directs and also co-stars). DiNiro is on record in almost every interview about the film as saying that The Good Shepard was more the story of the birth of counter-intelligence than it was a Bond-like action movie with gadgets, car chases and explosions.

And indeed a good, interesting story it is. It definitely keeps you interested. The acting is superb. And, sure, there's a little action. But Hollywood lately is self-absorbed with movies that are well over 2 hours, and The Good Shepard's tune could have been named in a lot less than 167 minutes.

That's right...2 hours and 47 minutes. I was reminded of this movie the other day as I was walking through the corrals that lead up to the airport security checkpoint....You go back and forth seemingly forever seeing the same people pass you on the left and right a dozen times before you reach your ultimate goal of putting your bag on the X-ray belt and walking through the metal detector with no real sense of joy that you just finished a task that should have taken 5 minutes but took 30 minutes. In The Good Shepard you wait and wait for something to happen seeing the same actors over and over again with very little action and then the movie just ends with no real sense that there was a story that led up to ""that climactic moment"".

So do you want to hurry up and wait to see how the CIA was born? At minimum, it's a well-told story. Ya got a minute...or 167? Give The Good Shepard a large allocation of your time.",1177632000,5,2067,4.443271767810026

It doesn't show or tell anything we can't guess, nor care. If I were a betting man, Damon probably didn't like this script; but because De Niro is behind the project he probably gave it the green light. Jolie probably needed the money to adopt more kids.

2752144,5,B000MXPE7Y,"_The Good Shepherd_ is a paranoid's delight, detailing the rise of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as it initially developed following World War II.  Directed by Robert DeNiro (who also has a role in the film as a general who played a key part in creating the CIA), this film shows us a rare glimpse into the world of spies and counter-spies, paranoia, and secrecy that surrounds the cult of intelligence.  Much of the film is indeed an accurate portrayal of the history of said agency and its role in America's foreign policy decision making throughout much of the Twentieth Century.  The film follows the career of Edward Wilson (played by Matt Damon) from his early years as a poetry student at Yale University, periodically spying on his professors who allegedly were linked to Nazi-sympathetic organizations, to his role in the development of the Allied intelligence community during World War II, to the creation of the CIA and the birth of the Cold War and beyond.  The film is one of epic proportions (some have compared it to other classics such as _The Godfather_) and is essential viewing for all thinking people.  In the world of undercover operations, no one is to be trusted.  Whether or not a certain individual is in fact working for Allied intelligence, the Nazis, or later the Soviets simply cannot be determined, and we witness this world develop as the sense of trust breaks down and paranoia ensues.  The movie travels back and forth between the events that gave rise to the Bay of Pigs fiasco (also hinting at the later Kennedy assassination - believed by some conspiracy theorists to have been the work of the CIA) and the earlier career of Wilson.  At Yale University, Wilson joins up with the class of upper crust WASPs (the ""Old Americans"") and takes part in their adolescent rituals as part of the ultra-secretive Skull and Bones fraternity.  (Many of our political leaders have arisen from this fraternity and some have conjectured that they are responsible for wielding the true power in the world.  The movie even hints at the idea that they may have been responsible for ""Soviet power"" as well, as the true puppet masters behind world events.)  Wilson falls in love with a deaf girl (he has a certain ""weakness"" for deaf girls as we are to see later in the movie); however, a brief affair of his with an upper class girl leads to an unplanned pregnancy and thus forces him to marry.  (However, it should be pointed out that one gets the impression that the ""elites"" are manipulating the whole thing from behind the scenes anyway, because throughout the movie never once is definitive proof provided that the child is even his.  Furthermore, he is to go away for a long time to aid the Allied war effort and thus is not even there to see his newborn son.)  From his early days of spying on university professors (or are they really?), Wilson becomes more and more involved in the intelligence community.  This leads him to serve on the side of the Allies during World War II.  Following World War II, the Allied leaders make a trade of Nazi scientists for Jewish scientists, and thus begins the Cold War as the Soviet power and America and Britain contend for control of the world.  Eventually a series of events will force Wilson to make the ultimate sacrifice - one of many in his desire to further the aims of American imperialism and consolidate the power of the CIA.  The movie also shows and hints at such historical realities as the presence of homosexuals in the intelligence community (and the fact of their homosexuality being used to blackmail them - the rites of the Skull and Bones fraternity could also be described as vaguely homoerotic for that matter!) and the CIA's experiments with drugs (in particular LSD).  There are some rather chilling lines and uncanny prophecies in this movie which haunted me for days following my viewing of it.  At one point Robert DeNiro's character remarks that it was the ""clerks and civil servants"" who gave Hitler his power, and thus it will be necessary to somehow limit the CIA's power because otherwise it runs the risk of creating a totalitarian surveillance state.  Secondly, at one point in the movie Matt Damon's character (Wilson) is asked by Joe Pesci (playing an Italian mobster) what ""his people"" (presumably the upper crust WASPs) have, mentioning that the Italians have the church, Jews have their tradition, and blacks have their music.  To this, Damon replies that they have the United States of America and that the rest are just visitors here.  At another point, it is said that the people from the CIA never put a ""the"" in front of CIA.  When asked why, they reply that putting a ""the"" in front of CIA would be like putting a ""the"" in front of God.  (Angelina Jolie's character remarks on several occassions that during the dinners of the Skull and Bones fraternity they first account for all members of the Bonesmen and then invoke God.  As she puts it, ""Agency first, God second."")  These are some of the chilling lines from the movie.  Ultimately the movie raises some very disturbing questions about the nature of government.  As America heads further and further towards a surveillance state (brought further in that direction with each impending war), it becomes necessary to examine where we have come from.  As is asked in the movie, do the elite controllers who make and break world events try to keep war to a minimum, or do they merely use war to further their own agendas and consolidate their power?  Certainly a scary question to ponder.  I feel that this movie offers much to think about (and ultimately is very frightening!), but so long as the tough questions remain unasked and people remain asleep at the wheel, it will be that much easier for those in power to slide us off into totalitarianism.  Finally, I should say that I find it odd that this movie (which not only offers much food for thought but is genuinely very well put together) has gathered such low reviews.  Perhaps it is just a further indication of the fact that the public does not like to think and ask questions and this is scary in and of itself.",1176940800,13,6141,4.719101123595506

Yes, the movie is long and slow in parts such as the beginning, but it's still extremely well done.  I'd really give it 4 1/2 stars but it's not an option - the only thing keeping it from the full five stars is its length (nearly 3 hours).  It is an interesting story with a unique inside look at things we otherwise do not get the chance to see - not just the beginning of the CIA, but also of the infamous Skull and Bones secret society of Yale.  The cinemetography is beautiful and all of the cast gives believable, strong performances.  So, while it is long, it's also gripping and compelling.

It is an iteresting piece about the beginning of the CIA and the conflicts early on in the cold war. The movie is a reflection of an agents life from his beginning in the military intelligence in WWII to him signing on with the CIA.  Its done in a number of flashback, and the main film is taking place after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba back in mid april 1961.  A lot of stories to try and pick up on, lots of double crossing plots etc, but in the end I was left dissappointed. I thought the plot gave itself up earlier than expected, and then the movie just kinda ended, just fizzling out. It was a long film 2 H 49 min, and I think at the end of the film some big things happened, but just got drug out as the rest of the film did.  Just to long, lost its pizazz, and really wattered down what could have been great.  Could have been condensed to about 2 hours and still been good. Worth watching if you like a little mystery and suspense, as well as a look at that period in history, one which I was happy to see a portrayal of and lead me to do and sparked me to do a little reseach in history.",1176940800,,1190,3.9873949579831933

I had to leave in the first 20 minutes because it was that bad.  The only reason he wanted me to see it cause he wanted me to suffer through it like him.  HAH! Well I knew better.  I came back for the last 15 minutes of the movie (it was still on).  I didn't understand what happened, but had I watched it through, I still wouldntve understood.

Well, that's what unfortunately accompanies this dull and somber film.  Unfortunately, because of its all-star cast, although this wouldn't be the first time in movie history where an all-star cast is wasted.  Aside from an interesting peek into the world of Yale's secret Skull and Bones society, a delightful cameo by Joe Pesci and a few too cute-by-half zingers, this movie has little or nothing to offer.  It doesn't keep one's attention and by the time you try to care enough about what is going on, you realize that you don't even care about the characters.  Matt Damon's skulking and scowling leading role lacks rhythm and chemistry, especially with the beautiful Angelina Jolie, and he is laughably miscast as a father.  In fairness however, with the script he's been given, it's hard to see how Damon could have done much better.  The pacing of the film is extradinarily slow and one can just imagine people walking out of the theater before it ends.

2752150,2,B000MXPE7Y,"I had high hopes for this movie, given the cast and storyline.

But it's about 45 minutes too long and there are many moments that should've been left on the cutting room floor rather than taking up precious time in the final version.  Unless you really love Matt Damon, stories about the CIA, or spy tales without the gore or action, you will find this movie to be pretty boring in terms of the time it takes to tell the story and general pacing of the main storyline.

And, while this is about the internal workings of Edward Wilson, the character played by Damon, you find out very little about who he is actually and why he did the things that he did.  Development of Wilson as the ""CIA company man"" is pretty standard or stereotypical, from the Skull and Bones club to the connections he has with important and powerful key players who would move his career along.  The last scene in the movie is telling (I won't give anything away), as you watch Wilson.  silently walk along the halls of the new CIA office he's set to create.  By the end you realize this is a man who lost much in terms of soul, his family, and his ideals in the service of his career with the CIA, but yet, after all that, he still manages to wake up again the next morning, dress himself in drab clothing, and show up at the office to tackle another day's worth of work.  But why?  The movie ends without offering anything substantial or insightful to answer this haunting question.  The relationship that he had with his father is important to Wilson, but the story doesn't develop this beyond tantilizing tidbits dropped occasionaly through the whole movie.

Finally, the movie squanders the talents of many fine actors.

Perhaps a sharper focus on the story line and a bit more action in the storytelling would have helped.  Yet, the movie is to be appreciated for the relative under-use of gore and violence to move the story along or keep viewers hooked.",1176768000,10,1936,4.512893982808023

It is exceedingly slow, too long and the farthest thing from being a thriller than one could imagine. Damon sleep walks through this 2 hour, 48 minute snooze fest and Angelina is delegated to the role of a long suffering ignored housewife (as if that could happen).

This is not usually a problem area for me, but there were so many characters and short, cryptic encounters that I found several scenes plain confusing.  The terrific cast is not given much leeway, and the Matt Damon character, in particular, has an emotional repertoire that ranges from A to B; while clearly the intent of the film, it offers few clues to his inner life.

Althought that is what I received, for the most part, the difficult aspect of the movie was the feeling that the fine actors were aloof.  I had trouble connecting with some of the characters, especially the main leads.  Matt Damon did an excellent job, and I imagine he was directed in such a way as to seem a bit ambiguous.  Jolie's character could have been much richer; however, I think the complicated plot took such a long time to tell, that character development took a backseat.  To put this movie in terms of a novel, this would be a LeCarre vs. a Ludlum.  Do not go into this movie expecting a thrill a minute ala a Ludlum novel, rather expect a meandering complicated story ala LeCarre's Absolute friends.

I have noted some very well-written reviews regarding this movie.  I agree with several of the reviewers.  However, I would argue with anyone who lables this a bad or terrible movie.  It is certainly not in my opinion.  This is a solid four star movie that falls short of a higher rating due to the inaccessibility of the characters.",1176595200,4,1172,4.608695652173913
2752160,5,B000MXPE7Y,"Wow.  This is one strong movie.  If you are seeking a traditional action-adventure film, look elsewhere; this film is cerebral and not brain candy.  It is a mostly fictionalized story of the formation of the CIA, from its distant relative the OSS during WWII, to more recent times.  The story revolves around Edward Wilson (played perfectly by Matt Damon) as a privileged Yale graduate that is drawn into the counter-espionage ""business"".  I must take exception to the comment by the Amazon.com reviewer when he states: ""Viewers have to wonder why anyone, much less someone like Wilson who has everything going for him, would devote his life to a thankless job that brings so little happiness to himself and his family.""  Such a comment reflects on the reviewers failure to perceive Wilson for what he is, a committed individual with a strong sense of duty.  Wilson sees himself ""called to duty"" much, it appears, as did his father.  He places the interests of his country above his own needs and that of his family.  While you can argue the merits and dangers of nationalism, there certainly are such men and Wilson is clearly one.  I think this is a superb film, not perfect, but still superb.  It provides a fascinating window into the birth of the CIA and the struggles of the men that lived the experience.  It is a film you will watch many times.",1176595200,4,1352,4.706382978723404
2752161,3,B000MXPE7Y,"This film is a not very successful attempt at combining a Cold War spy thriller with psychological realism.  A loosely fictionalized account of events in the history of the CIA and based probably on the life of James Angleton, the long time and controversial head of CIA counter-intelligence.  The Bay of Pigs fiasco, the CIA sponsored coup against the Arbenz regime in Guatemala, and the Kim Philby disaster are among the events used in the plot.  The movie shows the genesis of the CIA in the WWII OSS and its staffing from the heart of the American establishment with the role of the Yale secret society Skull and Bones featured prominently.  These episodes are fairly well done but not sufficiently well to give this film a truly historic quality.

As a thriller, this film is a failure.  It is not particularly suspenseful, partly because the outcome of events is clearly known.  The characters, however, are not engaging enough to elicit sympathy.  Matt Damon's performance might be described as wooden, though the script doesn't give him much to work with.  The film's attempts at giving the Damon character some psychological depth through events of his childhood is a bit too pat to be convincing.

A key plot device is a piece of audiotape that gives clues to the betrayal of the Bay of Pigs invasion.  This unclear tape reveals information that is unexpected by and provokes a crisis for the Damon character.  Movie-goers with good memories will recognize this as the key plot device of Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation, a very good film made about 30 years ago.  As Coppola is one of the producers of this film, its likely this is a conscious piece of derivation.

Ronin, which he coproduced was a respectable entry into the field until director Frankenheimer succumbed to filming the ultimate urban car chase.

First of all, the only thing it had in common with the Godfather is that three people got wacked, DeNiro was in it and it was really long at 2 hours and 47 minutes. Oh, and it has Joe Pesci in it too, who has been known to cohoot with the mobster types.

Thriller? There was absolutely nothing thrilling about it. In fact, it was very slow and tedious. It starts off interesting, showing how Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) was recruited and indoctrinated into the world of spying and the elite secret group ""the Skull & Bones"". It also has an interesting Love story between Wilson, Clover (Angelina Jolie) & a shy deaf girl named Laura (Tammy Blanchard).

The problem with the film is that it didn't need to be nearly 3 hours long. It really didn't. The movie had no elements of intrigue or hook. It was just a series of events that showed how the life of a spy slowly and systematically destroyed a good man.

The film is well filmed and well acted, I'm not knocking these elements of the film. It was just boring.

To make a long story short, which DeNiro (who directed the film) should have done, the movie could have been shortened dramatically. After about an hour and forty minutes of the film, I found myself hitting the fast forward button and fully understanding everything that was speeding past my eyes.

Here we have the Chips, the Chazzes, the Chets, and the Skippers of the Polo-shirt set, along with their clench-jawed, desperate-eyed females whose primary purpose early in life seems to be to engineer mating themselves (love doesn't even enter into the equation) to one of these obnoxious monied frat boys.  Really, with their assortment of silly Masonic-style Olde-Boy's Club rituals--most of which have a distinctly homosexual underpinning--these oh-so-white Americans look exactly like what they are: transplanted 17th-century Englishmen with all the class snobbery, racism, superiority, and pooftery symptomatic of the upper-eschelon Brit.  While this is essentially a soap-opera melodrama with very little action or story-driven impetus, there is nary a well-developed character to be found.  It's a bunch of miserable privileged white people taking three hours to demonstrate their misery...oh, and by the way they hold the Fate of all of us in their clammy whitebread hands.  Yikes.  There are two things that stuck out in this trudge of a movie for me.  One is the way Matt Damon's horn-rimmed-glasses/short haircut character physically put me in mind of Robert MacNamara--which is probably no accident.  The other is what I think is the most resonant line in the movie: when asked by Joe Pesci's aging Italian gangster--currently under threat of deportation by the US back to Italy--what it is that bloodless, cold, anonymous, WASPy types like Matt Damon's character have as a cultural group, Damon's Edward Wilson answers, with chilling lack of emotion, ""We have America.  The rest of you (meaning Jews, Blacks, Italians, etc) are just visiting.""

However, as a study of character development in the 1930s Isolationist Period, and with a young man choosing an intelligence and counterintelligence career, it hits the mark well.  This is possibly Damon's best so far, as the young idealistid Edward who attends Yale (where, by the way a Gilbert and Sullivan Light Opera with a man in a woman's role is not a ""homosexual"" overtone, as this was a conventional way of doing Gilbert and Sullivan....).  He joins the Army and fledgling OSS, making a 6 year exit from his husband-seeking Bones brother's sister who gets pregnant before he knows what is really happening, meeting his son for the first time in 1946.  By this time, he is well indoctrinated and comfortable with the Black Arts.

The film starts and ends with the Bay of Pigs debacle, by which time he has learned to trust no one and has no real friends.  By 1961, he is humorless and quite comfortable with this role.

He is so darn reserved and somber -- even when a couple of the surprises hit.  I actually stopped the movie as the character development didn't hold my interest.  Glad I went back because the second half of the movie was worth it!

The director took a lot of leeway with the history of the CIA, from what I've read.  It doesn't hurt the movie but historians might complain.

Camera work and scenery are great.  The sets were authentic and made me feel like I was looking back in time.  The 1960s buses, taxicabs, clothing -- it added to the movie.  The 1960s era glasses were an especially nice touch.  The makeup used to age Angelina Jolie and Matt Damon was impressive.  They actually appeared to age throughout the movie.

Was annoyed by the jumping back and forth in the movie.  Felt there was more than necessary.  First we are in 1961, then 1920s, then 30s, then 60s, then 40s -- the constant changing annoyed me.

One could argue that's the very essence of his character--he's so guarded that he is truly unknowable--but who wants to watch a 3hr movie about a guy like that?

If you come to this work expecting to be easily entertained, I guess this movie is not for you. This is no Bond/Bourne flick. No glamour here, although there are plenty of stars. No likeable characters. No special effects. No cheap baits to atract audiences.

For me, however, the way the life of the spy is narrated by De Niro is fascinating. Since his childhood, Edward Wilson's character is forged through extreme, even dramatic, decisions. From his father death to the love of his life, not forgetting the death of his mentor. Tough choices modelling a person who, apparently, never hesitates. Regretless. A man quietly merciless with his enemies, colleagues and wife. America over all with one only weakness: his son. A study of ethics under an apparent dull and grey existence.

Plot and direction are inmaculate. Good acting. Superb cinematography.

One last comment: although I reckon that this is a movie for minories, I cannot understand Amazon editorial review by Jae-Ha Kim.

2752172,1,B000MXPE7Y,"Damon was acting!? I could have sworn I just spent 3 hours watching someone imitating a fence post with enormous success, but apparently he was meant to be included in the plot. Man, talk about egg on MY face!

Damon plays the same wooden, expressionless character in every paint-by-the-numbers film he appears in; people have become so conditioned to jumping onboard and proclaiming a celebrities' 'brilliance' regardless of quality that he continues to enjoy the inexplicable reputation of a thespian. A proper vehicle for his talent would be to shoot 'Weekend at Bernies 3: Unwatchable Attraction'. He has shown us in 'The Good Sheperd' that he can imitate a lifeless and uninteresting corpse with the best of 'em! No doubt Matt Damon is a pleasant enough person in real life, but I think everyone would be happier if he found himself a job on a road crew or something.

  This film was badly edited, and that's putting it mildly. I suppose it was intended to add a sort of 'layered' effect in the plot, though I admit I could easily be wrong. In any event, I found the incessant jumping through decades to be an irritant throughout. The film dragged on and on and ON, introducing characters and plot devices the writers didn't seem to know what to do with . Another problem here is that the characters are, without exception, extremely unlikeable people, and I found myself unable to generate an ounce of warmth for any of them. About 20 minutes into this Marathon of Mediocrity ( Just 13 miles, folks!) I found myself fervently hoping that everyone involved would go away and be drowned together. This hope was, alas, not realized.

2752174,3,B000MXPE7Y,"This movie is a fictionalized oral history of the genesis of the CIA, from its early days as the ""Office of Strategic Services"" through the Bay of Pigs debacle.  Its real story is the sacrifice that its protagonist ""Edward Wilson"" (Matt Damon) makes in order to serve the agency.  The Wilson character is a loose fictionalization of real-life former CIA Deputy Director for Counterintelligence James Jesus Angleton.

I enjoyed this movie, and it is full of atmosphere, good dialog, and interesting historical background. There are lots of minor appearances by big stars such as Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, William Hurt, and others. What this film sorely lacks is a solid plot.  There simply isn't one, which is surprising.  Essentially the film takes the Wilson character at about the Bay of Pigs time frame, into a series of flashbacks, as we see how his entire life has centered around his devotion to the CIA to the exclusion of all else.  The ""plot"" if there is one, is simply this theme: that Wilson sacrifices all, family, fatherhood, his marriage, to serve the CIA.  During World War II and its aftermath, he simply disappears to his new wife for six years, and when he abruptly returns, he is not surprisingly a stranger to her.  This indifference to family in favor of career and devotion to duty is the real theme of this film.

I enjoyed this film for its atmosphere and subject matter, but the lack of a plot is impossible not to miss and regret, because this could have been a great movie.  Cold War espionage offers limitless possibilities for telling a solid story (i.e. one with a plot and solid storyline) and the story of James Jesus Angleton is a fascinating one that would make for a superb film, properly done. This piece, however, does not succeed in being that film. That is truly unfortunate.

Angleton fought for years to prevent KGB infiltration of the CIA, and this caused an awesome amount of turmoil within the Agency.  After Angleton left as head of Counter-intelligence, a series of catastrophes ensued within the CIA.  We were treated to the Walker spy scandals, Aldrich Aimes, the Hansen betrayal, and other counterintelligence debacles of the type that Angleton prevented during his watch.  He truly was ""The Good Shephard.""  Unfortunately, this film fails to really tell this story, and leaves the viewer wishing for more plot and less atmosphere.",1176163200,,2381,4.858910891089109

2752178,2,B000MXPE7Y,"Ever since Hollywood has been producing and releasing films,it has always been quite interesting to see how they depict history into an entire film. So,with ""The Good Shepherd"" taking place the eras of World War II and the Bay of Pigs,with a great cast of actors (Matt Damon,Angelina Jolie,Robert De Niro,Alec Baldwin,William Hurt,and,despite the fact that you only get a cameo appearance out of him,Joe Pesci),the film is great,right?

Unfortunately,the answer to that question is wrong.

First of all,""The Great Shepherd"" has one of the strongest plots ever to be used for a movie. It is about a young man named Edward Wilson (Matt Damon),who has had a tough life. During the middle of his childhood,he lost his father to suicide. And,even though his attendance at Yale University gave Edward Wilson a strong chance for success in his adult life,Edward made two mistakes during his college years. Those mistakes? Accepting an invitation into the Office of Strategic Services (the CIA's predecessor)by a general named Bill Sullivan(Robert De Niro)during World War II,and getting a young woman named Margaret Ann Russell(Angelina Jolie)pregnant. Now,years have passed by,and as Edward realizes he made mistakes,he must deal with two hard tasks at the same time:1)saving his marriage,and 2)investigating the Office of Strategic Services (this is during the Bay of Pigs era)with Sam Murach (Alec Baldwin)and Philip Allen (William Hurt),while he keeps his work in the OSS during World War II a secret. Can Edward Wilson succeed at all of this,or has his past mistakes done too much damage to his current life?

So,what sends ""The Good Shepherd"" downhill? First of all,this film's script is completely messy and unarranged. The events that are documented in this film are not documented in chronological order,and are presented back and forth. This makes the film hard to follow and understand,and does not give its viewers the information they would want to know concerning Edward Wilson's service in the Office of Strategic Services and his investigation of the OSS. Second of all,there are several events in this film that pop up out of the blue,and have NOTHING to do with the film's plot,with no explanation as to why the certain event (unfortunately,and most notably,this film's one and only scene that feautures Joe Pesci)is in the film. The acting here is strong,but does not even come close to saving this film.

Overall,a film that had potential to be a great film,but was unfortunately ruined by its lazy script. Unless you are just interested to see Joe Pesci after the total of eight years that Pesci was M.I.A.,""The Good Shepherd"" is a waste of time and money.",1175990400,3,2670,5.13103448275862

Does it step up to the level of The Godfather as a classic movie?  Robert DeNiro directs and stars, Matt Damon, Angelin Jolie, Alec Baldwin, William Hurt and the list of supportng castmates goes on.  At two hours and forty-eight minutes it's definitely got epic written all over it.  Well...

I look at good long movies like this: if I start to squirm in my seat, it's too long for it's own good.  If I don't even notice the extended length, it's a damn good.

I squirmed.
Sorry.

The Good Shepherd is the story of Edward Wilson, a Yale graduate and all around good guy who happens to belong the the Skull & Bones Society. Neat little upper class cult that it is,  like Frat Boys meets The Illuminati.  Creepy.  Edward witnessed his father's suicide at the age of six and actualy stole the suicide note before anyone got there.  He confesses this while lying naked in a sarcophigi surrounded by his hooded, black-cloaked Skull & Bones brethren. Okay...  Hitler is rising in Europe and even though America is still firmly out of the conflict, the OSS decides it's time to start doing things to keep the U.S. in the game without being directly involved.  The CIA is born.  Counterintelligence.  Spies.  Networks.  The whole nine yards and Edward Wilson is right there from the beginning, traveling to Europe for six years, leaving behid a wife (Jolie) he barely knows and a son yet-to-be-born.

The human side of The Good Shepherd is interesting.  Edward fel in love with a deaf girl named Laura and had planned to be with her always, but during a little Skull & Bones reunion, he is taken into the woods by a Senator' daughter and seduced.  She gets pregnant.  He marries her.  So long Laura.  Damn.  We see the rise and fall of Edward Wilson not only as a spy, a counterintelligence agent for the newly spawned CIA, but as a human being.  His morales are tested. His allegiance, too.  His trust in others is absolutely extinguished.  He winds up having hs son's pegnant fiance thrown from an airplane on her way to their wedding because she was working for the KGB.  Nice.

Overall, The Good Shepherd is a good movie sharing time between the year leading up to WWII and the faled CIA-sponsored rebellion against Cuba's Castro at the beginning of The Cold War.  De Niro directs masterfully and the cast is well-rounded.  But...I still squirmed and that means that something was lacking.  When you bring up a movie like The Godfather and then compare it, no matter how casually, there is bound to be problems. The Good Shepherd had too many slow spots where a good editing by De Niro might have made it better.  Still a good movie.  I would definitely watch it again, but not too soon.  It may take a while to digest it, perhaps nurtue a fondness for it. Could you spend your money more wisely?  Maybe.  But there aren't too many flick coimng out of this caliber, however, so make your choice.  You should not be too disappointed.

2752186,4,B000MXPE7Y,"A solid movie about the early history of the CIA. Robert De Niro is not among the most fluid of filmmakers, but his movie is consistently informative and interesting. The movie is surprisingly balanced, neither blindly apologetic of the CIA nor wildly condemnatory. De Niro even plays a small role, as a General based on Bill Donovan, the founder of the OSS (the characters in this movie are thinly veiled portraits of real people, but with different names). The protagonist in the movie is Edward Wilson, played by Matt Damon and clearly inspired by James Jesus Angleton (the counterintelligence chief at the CIA for many years). Though the fact that Angleton was half Mexican is omitted here, most of his professional life appears here: his early life as a student of poetry in Yale, his role in World War II as an intelligence officer, his relationship with Kim Philby (who goes here by the name of Arch Cummings, and is played, against type, by Billy Crudup), his role in the Golitsyn-Nosenko affair. He also appears as having a role in two operations he wasn't directly involved: the 1953 coup against Guatemalan president Jacobo Arbenz and the 1961 failed invasion of Bay of Pigs. One of the few flaws of the movie is its try at amateur psychology by having Wilson's motivations based on the suicide of his father (something which did not happen in Angleton case).

2752188,3,B000MXPE7Y,"""The Good Shepherd"" is an interesting, but ultimately frustrating, close to three hour slog.  DeNiro, who directed the movie, shows, for the most part, restraint in his CIA epic.  There are some preachy moments where DeNiro seems to be making some comment on current events, and even a few Oliver Stone like whoppers, cloaked in the movie's muted tone.  Whatever.  But at one point there is the inevitable Be-Careful-You-Don't-Lose-Your-Soul line.  The problem is that the movie, by the time that line is delivered, has established in the viewer's mind that what is being watched is pretty much soulless exercise in filmmaking.  As much as it wants to be, the film never seems to develop into an Epic.  The Length is there, the meticulous craftsmanship in the framing of scenes (why I'm giving this 3 stars), but when it comes to getting a real historical sweep, things get hazy.  Oh, there's the Bay of Pigs, and old Nazi clips, but historical hooks are surprisingly few.  The lead casting is also very questionable.  Damon as the robotic and detached ""company"" man, Edward Wilson, and the exotic Jolie as the wife and mother, Clover - Margaret, is bizarre.  Actually, both actors do very well, it's just that physically they seem to be wrong fits for the roles.  Further, neither actor seems to ever age in a movie that spans decades.  The model here, was obviously the ""Godfather II.""  Unfortunately, the Good Shepherd lack both the scale and the story of what is one of the greatest American films.  And that should have been expected.

The movie does have several ""good"" moments however.  The Skull & Crossbones stuff, seemed pretty authentic, even if you've read about it a dozen times in fiction and nonfiction.  And the plane ride murder is chilling, as is the brutal interrogation of a defector.  But three hours worth?

Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson, one of the first CIA operatives, and the story is a takeoff of a real person. We meet Edward as the Bay Of Pigs debacle is taking place. We then move back to Edward's time at Yale, his initiation to a secret club for WASPS. This leads him to the secret service life in England during the War. Before he leaves Yale, he meets Angelina Jolie,who he impregnates, marries, leaves fir 6 years while he is secreting in England. They have the child, a boy, who Edward meets when Jr is 6. The marriage is not good, strangers  in the night, so to speak.

Edward moves into the CIA at the behest of the big guy who has the ears of Washington. Life becomes work all the time. Not much time for the boy. Russian spies and secrets. This is a fabulous look at the CIA and the secret agent man. The ins and outs, the secrets. Matt Damon is superb as the gaunt, humorless Edward Wilson. All work and no play makes a dull boy.  I wish the film had become a hit, but it is almost three hours long, too dull for most people.  I loved it.

Sadly that was my experience with the Good Shepherd! I am Shocked at just how bad this film was! This Film had so many things going for it: MATT DAMON, ANGELINA JOLIE, WILLIAM HURT, ALEC BALDWIN and ROBERT DENIRO(acting and Directing), a Story Line that really hasn't been explored much in films, that is the beginning of The CIA. This Movie Should have Been Great, So what Happened? Well, to start off, this movie is LONG and SLOW, clocks in at 160 Minutes(felt like 160 hours). There really isn't any excitement, no major cloak and dagger incidents. The Cold War with Russia should have been explored way more but in this film, it just gets a glossy over. The film kept going back and forth from the late 1930's-early 1940's to the late 1950's-early 1960's but what Deniro forgot to do was age Matt Damon when they did go back and forth, Matt plays a 20 year in  1939 and in 1959 , he still looks like a little boy, this was very distracting in the film and I had a hard time figuring out what period the film was in. I guess after the producers paid Matt, Angelina and Deniro, their huge salaries, they couldn't afford a decent makeup artist. The Film is also very depressing, not many happy people in this film, matt damon's character is miserable throughout, keeps everyone at a distance.

2752197,4,B000MXPE7Y,"THE GOOD SHEPHERD may take a lot of patience to sit through the nearly three hour tale written by Eric Roth (Munich, Forrest Gump, Ali, The Horse Whisperer, etc) and directed with meticulous attention to detail by Robert De Niro, but in the end the film about the creation of CIA (""ever notice that no one these 'the CIA' just like no one use 'the God'?"").  And although the script confuses the viewer by its propensity to meander over many time frames and many places, the result is a tense attention holding look at the machinations of big government and frightening big Intelligence organizations.

We first meet Edward Bell Wilson (Matt Damon, who carries the film well)  as a son who witnesses his father's suicide, a fact he will hide for years. He follows in the family footsteps of attending Yale, participating in the infamous Skull and Bones secret club, and progressed to join the government as an agent for Intelligence, eventually helping to form CIA and participate in the Cold War tension with Russia and the Bay of Pigs incident.  Wilson is a nebbish on the surface, but underneath lies a man devoted to his country and a man capable of maintaining heavy secrets, even from his wife-of-necessity Clover (Angelina Jolie) whom he marries solely because he got her pregnant.  He is distant, covert, and seemingly cold, a trait that he will pass on to his son whose life following CIA  results in tragedy.

Along the way from this personal side of the story the plot is filled with politicians, spies, Russian, moles, double agents - all the expected and needed characters for a story of this sort.  The cast includes such important actors as Billy Crudup, Joe Pesci, Alec Baldwin, a superb Tammy Blanchard, Robert De Niro himself, Keir Dullea, Michael Gambon, William Hurt, John Turturro, Timothy Hutton and Gabriel Macht, each performing excellent cameos.  The production values are equally strong with Robert Richardson as director of photography mixing historical footage with atmospheric cinematography, a fine musical score by Bruce Fowler and Marcelo Zarvos, and a tight editing by Tariq Anwar.  The film could easily have been cut by an hour without damaging the effect, but there is something to be said for the level of tension achieved by De Niro's choices that gives us a feeling of being a part of the Intelligence schemes.

2752199,4,B000MXPE7Y,"I found this film to be totally absorbing, and yet, I can see how it would not appeal to those who are looking for fast-paced action. The tone is intense, moody, and thought-provoking. The main character, played convincingly by Matt Damon, is very loosely based upon James Jesus Angleton, a Yale poet, who studied counter-espionage with Kim Philby in the British SIS during World War II, and who presided over counter-espionage in the CIA during its infancy. A theme that the film explores is the toll taken by espionage on the life of the effective agent who must compartmentalize himself, since the conflicting demands of his secret work and his family are incompatible. Utter detachment is the key to survival, and Matt Damon plays the spy's abdication from all emotion to perfection.

The cinematography and costumes are stunning, the music is riveting, and the actors are excellent. It is not always easy, however, to follow the story; it took several viewings for me to piece the complex events of the narrative together. In fact, the half-dozen deleted scenes, provided on the DVD, help immensely. In my opinion, the sequences with Damon's brother-in-law, who has spent time in a Soviet labor camp and may or may not be a brain-washed penetration agent, should never have been cut, since they explain a lot about the main character's family dynamic.

Since the scenes shift back and forth (although the subtitles explain the location and time-frame adequately), some important plot points have been lost. For instance, in one scene the son asks to become a CIA agent, but we are never told that he actually does join. Is it after his initiation into the Agency that he falls into the Soviet honey-trap? How does he get to the Congo in the first place? Does Damon's character actually suspect  the true identity of the victim in the blackmail film? And is he responsible for the outcome or is his Soviet counterpart? These are only a few of the questions that are left to be pondered.

Since the story is highly fictionalized, I am not certain why the directors introduced the young Cambridge SIS liason officer, who speaks articulately in London of the Blitz, but who develops a pronounced stammer in 1950-something Washington shortly before he defects to Moscow. Is he supposed to be a composite of Burgess, Maclean, and Philby (who stammered but did not defect until 1963)? That sub-plot is never developed. And why give the duplicitous Soviet defector-mole in Washington the name of an historical KGB officer, Yuri Modin (who was neither in Washington nor ever defected). Even though he was in London posing as a Soviet Embassy cypher clerk and  actually running Burgess and Blunt, he never pretended to be anyone other than Yuri Modin. I found this use of a real name to be jarring, since all the other characters have been given fictional names. Why not merely call the character Ivan Ivanovich?  Seems a bit rough on Modin!

These are mere quibbles, though, in a story that I found, on the whole, fascinating despite the length of the film.

P.S. After watching this film for a fourth time and paying close attention to the chronology, I was able to discover at least some of the answers to some the questions that I posed above. I also believe that I have figured out the relationship of the title, ""The Good Shepherd,"" to the Yale ""Whiffenpoof Song"" that the Bonesmen sing several times in the film: 'We're poor little lambs who have lost our way . . .; We're little black sheep who have gone astray. . ."" The lyrics to this song also give us a clue to an additional theme of the movie (as well as an allusion to another famous film): ""Gentlemen . . . off on a spree, doomed from here to Eternity! Lord, have mercy on such as we. . .""",1175644800,13,3749,4.7217125382263

Eisenhower set a plan in motion to take Cuba back from Castro, but JFK balked at the last moment, failing to send enough troops or air support,  even though his military advisors implored him to do so. He lacked the will because he was afraid if we invaded Cuba more 'robustly' Khrushchev would respond by making a move for the western half of Berlin, and from there we'd be obligated to respond; Perhaps with an ICBM.  In truth Khrushchev was baffled that JFK failed to take back Cuba which he referred to as ""the little sausage shaped island.""  Because of JFKs indecisiveness with the Bay of Pigs Khrushchev found the huberis, 6 months later, to put Nukes on the island, which caused the missle crisis...But the crisis was overstated as the Soviets only had 11 ICBMs to our 300 plus, so they weren't about to do an 'exchange'.  Besides which (and this is seldom mentioned) a deal had been cut behind closed doors wherein we agreed to remove missles from Turkey (so the ""stand-off was all 'sound and fury' signifying nothin) and that's the real dope folks,  but back to the movie.
  In one scene they torture a Soviet spy, plying him with LSD (as an aside that qualifies as truth stranger than fiction: The CIA first tested acid in a whorehouse that was their front in San Fran.  The prostitutes gave their johns a tab while the spooks looked on thru one way mirrors in operation midnight climax) Anyhow, The tripping spy says they have nothing to fear from the Soviet Union, that it's just ""paint over rust"" and that they know it but they have to keep the appearance of a grave threat to justify and maintain spending for the military industrial complex.

2752202,1,B000MXPE7Y,"Having authored several books on the history of the CIA I find my friends in Hollywood sending me scripts about spies. One that was given by Wolfgang Peterson's office many years ago was an early version of The Good Shepherd. The original screenplay was far better then the movie that was produced. The movie as produced ended up with a storyline and screenplay that came off like a bad stew of CIA history and characters. In real life, James Angeleton, the real life person Damon's character is based on, went to England to train under Kim Philby. By killing off the British spy the moviemakers killed off the most interesting story line in the history of the CIA. You see Philby was a longtime Soviet agent in MI6. He betrayed Angleton in 1950's-60's Washington before defecting. After defecting Philby was giving the job of countering Angelton's protection of the CIA. The real story of Angleton and Kim Philby would make a far better film. Philby who defected after decades of being a traitor in MI6 was used by the Russians to target Angleton and a series of phony Russian defectors to convince our people the KGB had no role in killing President Kennedy. But I guess that story is not as interesting as making fun of the white anglo saxon establishment. If you want to watch something close to real and much more entertaining, buy The Spy Who Came in from The Cold or go see the amazing film about the Stasi, ""The Lives of Others"". For those of you who want to know what really happed about Angleton's era, read THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE CIA. DeNiro should have known better but he must be given credit for getting a movie about the CIA made at all. It really is the toughest sale in Hollywood.",1175040000,26,1700,4.5588235294117645

I am usually patient with movies and give them a good chance to get going but unfortunately this one didn't get off the ground. I compare it to Kevin Costner's 28 Days.

2752204,3,B000MXPE7Y,"I think the subject of the birth of the CIA is very interesting and should make for a killer movie, alas ""The Good Shepherd"" is not that. It boasts some very fine actors, eg Damon, Jolie and Baldwin, and the direction of Robert De Niro is fine indeed. Sadly the story is not up to par.

The story builds up too slowly and at times seems to be going nowhere. The main characters are too low key and thus don't really leave any impression reagardless of who plays them (this is especially true for Damons character). Also Angelina Jolie seems, in my opinion, miscast for the role of a neglected wife. She dosen't look the part to me, and then there's also the same problem as with Matt Damons character: it is too plain. The acting is good enough, the parts are jsut boring.

The interesting personas are all confined to minor parts for example the English professor played by Michael Gambon and John Turturros secretary/operative Brocco.

The movie is also a wee bit long. I think some of the scenes could've been omitted in order to pace the story and make it more tight.

Still, I think it's worth watching. There are some interesting scenes and some interesting dialogue along the way, definitely. Overall it's just a bit bland, that's all.",1174867200,5,1242,4.581081081081081
2752205,2,B000MXPE7Y,"The good shepherd has all of the spooky appeal a film could offer.  Actors who are very well known and recognized as some of the best in the business are seen in it.  So why does this movie stink so badly?  Well what they are really trying to capitalize on is simply everyone's fascination with skull and bones.  Everyone thinks oh yeah it is a secret club with influence so it is bad, well you know most people don't know anything about it in the first place, they just see some film depict a secret meeting and turn into hordes of walking zombies, ranting and raving ""Bush and Kerry were in it!"" I just laugh.  The way they spied and used recon and photographs to figure stuff out is kind of neat you know, because that is how they did it back then.  The lady getting thrown out of the airplane on her way to being married was by far the most sickening and sad scene in the film.  Other than that it just plods along like a legless zombie, crawling...reaching...for something it cannot capture.  Do your research because I did and most of the supposed ""facts"" of this film in regards to the beginning of the CIA are not even true, which just further shows how Hollywood will bastardize anything of the truth in order to sway the masses and make some money.  They easily accomplish the former, but the latter category they may have fallen short.  Then yeah spice it up with more skull bones meetings which are really so boring and full of false pomp that it is a wonder anyone has figured out these are less deadly than the gangs of thugs that are currently residing in places like Detroit and Orange County.  DeNiro is a great actor but he really cannot save this film.  Damon is superior in this role but Brangelina is clearly distracted by something and is not very focused.  Then again was she ever a great actress or is it just her attractive figure that gets her into this movie?  This film is like some complex dream that Oliver Stone had but forgot half of it so he let some stoner write the rest of the script don't you think?  Now here is a thought if you had snakes on that plane then they would not have had time to throw that woman out of there would they?

2752206,5,B000MXPE7Y,"I saw this movie in theaters with my family.  Both of my parents work for an intelligence agency, and we have all, to a less exaggerated degree, been living parts of this movie our whole lives.  The silence about work (they've adapted to talking about the people at their jobs rather than the work itself, a good compromise), the quiet phone calls, the gravity of the jobs are all very apparent to the four (sister included) of us.  That alone would have made the movie for me if I had seen it alone, but with the two of them quietly remarking on things the whole way through (""We used to have burn bins exactly like that!""  ""He should have crushed the paper he burned; just throwing it in the can leaves it able to be constructed."") was absolutely delightful.

That said, it was incredibly long, but I think it made up for it by being delicious the whole way through.  The script was alright at its worst points and brilliant at its best.  The ending is wonderfully satisfying -- I was worried that they were going to cut to credits after the CIA & God thing, but the letter scene that followed immediately afterwards was to die for.  If you see this movie for no other reason, see it for that ending letter scene.

I'm pretty picky about movies, but this one earned its five stars.  If you're going to see it because you like typical spy movies, maybe you'll be disappointed.  If you're a drama fan or if you have a special place in your heart for broken people or if you're actually in any way involved with the intelligence community yourself, I'm not sure why this isn't already in your cart.

The Good:

I thought the overall tone of the movie was brilliant, subtle, yet strong. very good screenplay. De Niro manages to extract the best from his actors. Matt Damon gave a good performance, as the cold CIA officer who has to make difficult decisions. I see that some reviewers have rated this as a slow movie. Maybe so, but if you adjust your pace with the movie and absorb the content, its a very well done movie in the end. Good plots, ideas etc..

The not so good:

Whoever did the casting for this movie, (i do not know how the process works, do the directors/ producers do it etc..) did a very bad job. Angelina Jolie, who maybe an accomplished actress in her own right, was very wrong for this role. somehow it just did not fit. and Robert de Niro playing General Bill Sullivan did not fit too much either.

Running Time:  167 minutes

Rated R violence, some sexuality, and language.

A gray winter day was a fitting time to see one of the first public screenings of a film called ""The Good Shepherd,"" whose chilly hero Edward Wilson (Matt Damon, in a role modeled in part on CIA founder, James Jesus Angleton) is not so much all things to all men as nobody to anybody. A composite figure in a portrait of the birth, rise, and moral shriveling of the American CIA, Matt Damon's disturbingly shut-down Wilson would be one of recent film's most tragic figures if he were not such a hollow, unappealing man. Directing a long-contemplated project using a screenplay by Eric Roth (who penned ""Munich""), Robert De Niro has forged a ""Godfather"" of Yankee spy-craft, a heavy, solemn epic about betrayal and loyalty in the world of espionage and counter-espionage dominated not by Italians as in the original ""Godfather,"" though Coppola produced, De Niro directed, and Joe Pesci has one of the liveliest on screen moments, but by uptight, stony, patrician WASPs.  Indeed as seen here the world of American intelligence is a privileged and exclusive and deeply conflicted one where Irish, blacks, and Italians need not apply; fathers are absent; privilege grows out of Skull and Bones at Yale, wives are betrayed; sons labor desperately to measure up, and the leading practitioners are ridden with guilt and suspicion. There is no one to trust and nothing to believe in - not family or tradition, or even music - only America, which Edward Wilson says belongs to his class. All others are just visiting.

Into this demoralizing story, damning in its picture of the world of white privilege and of intelligence itself but nonetheless intricately involving and at times genuinely disturbing, are woven some of the major incidents and personalities of the period from from before the Second World War - after which OSS morphed into CIA-- till after the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion under JFK, from hot war to cold war. You have Philbys and fake Russian turncoats, CIA execs siphoning off money to Switzerland in guise of chocolate boxes, and through it all you have a Cuba mole investigation that smashes Wilson's own family.  Wilson's true penchant was for a deaf girl named Laura (an excellent Tammy Blanchard); and with her is the only time Damon seems to develop human warmth. He is forced to marry the more elevated Margaret Russell (an uncomfortable Angelina Jolie) sister of one of his Skull and Bones colleagues who remains Wilson's Old Boy link to privilege ever after. Traumatic embarrassment, revelation of closest held secrets, and doubt of loyalty are seen as inborn elements of the espionage world. The very qualities that make a good spy, as seen here, also make a man untrustworthy.

Do spies ever have fun? Not much, as seen from the angle of Damon's character. Dr. Fredericks (Michael Gambon), a randy gay pseudo-intellectual who turns and turns again, is naughty, but he pays for it. Another Brit, Arch Cummings, played gamely by Billy Crudup, similarly wears a smile that turns to dust. A good professional of the lower ranks like Staff Sergeant Brocco (John Turturro), Wilson's OSS assistant in England, is a stern sadist whose use of LSD for an interrogation backfires fatally. Nasty sabotages are devised to spoil the left's Latin American agricultural schemes. Big foul-ups like the Bay of Pigs invasion lead to vicious internal purges. And through it all Wilson's son cringes and his wife pines; the marriage had dried up after his six-year absence during WWII; and his imploded selfhood is symbolized by his only hobby, building ships inside bottles. As the film bluntly puts it, the spy-master must choose either family or country; he can't have both. And is it all worth it? The Russian on LSD declares his country's armed might a myth perpetuated by America to justify its ongoing pursuit of world dominance. Is intelligence a needed quantity, or are its organizations self-perpetuating shams? The movie never gives a positive answer. This may be the cruelest picture of the spy game ever put on film.  Many fine actors play small unappealing roles as spy-masters or cold operatives. These include De Niro himself, Alec Baldwin, and William Hurt, all creditable, but unlikely to get Oscar nods for their tightly held back performances. Damon can be accused of the same limitation, though if his Wilson bothers you, he's done his job better than you may think. And young Eddie Redmayne, as Wilson's grown son, has one of the most gut-wrenching roles in a story notable for its devastating picture of the effects of career on family life.  Despite its epic scale and length (it's 160 minutes long), ""The Good Shepherd"" is more troubling than flashy, more thought-provoking than moving. Ultimately it may be somewhat an artistic failure. The criticism that it is either too long or too short, that it needed to be pared down or expanded to a mini-series, has some merit. But nonetheless as a work that considers big issues and asks big questions, it's one of the more serious and intellectually stimulating mainstream American films of the year.",1171324800,16,5340,4.97979797979798
2752212,5,B000MXPE7Y,"Like the ending of DeNiro's crazed protagonist,Travis Bickel in ""Taxi Driver"", this is a great, multilayered movie which portrays events but doesn't explain itself. And Yes, it is quite slowly paced.

The plot is really a re-do of John LeCarre's ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"". It deals with the transformation of the OSS to the CIA. Like George Smiley in ""Tinker, Tailor"", there is a Commie mole, and the deep-thinking but stoic, silent, Wilson goes back and forth in history trying to determine who, what happened and how.

Director DeNiro does NOT tell the viewer what is going on in Wilson's (Matt Damon) head. You need to figure that out, so viewers looking for a James Bond spy story with action and car chases will be disappointed. While fiction, some characters are based in fact, the Matt Damon character is a lot like James Jesus Angleton and the DeNiro, himself, plays the military guy who sets him up, Wild Bill Donovan, real people.

Secretive and clever Edmund Wilson goes from the upper class to Yale to the OSS in WWII, to the Director of Ops, the CIA master of disinformation, trying to confuse the communists for US strategic advantages. In the end he becomes emotionally frozen, can trust no one and he come to realize he has been betrayed over and over again, by everyone he trusts.

DeNiro talked a great deal with his mentor Martin Scorcese while making this movie.

Go see or buy this very subtle movie which is open to much potential interpretation. Both spycraft and the paranoia inherent in working for the CIA are portrayed very accurately here, for a change. I could swear parts of this are actually shot at Langley, even inside. Highly recommended. This movie should have been a nominee for Best Picture of the Year & Best Actor.

The real Wild Bill Donovan once said, ""Espionage is not a nice thing, nor are the methods employed exemplary. Neither are demolition bombs nor poison gas... ...We face an enemy who believes one of his chief weapons is that none but he will employ terror. But we will turn terror against him...""

2752213,3,B000MXPE7Y,"An intelligent spy story, somewhere along the tradition of John le Carre and Graham Greene, but set in the US intelligence environment, i.e. of course CIA and predecessors. Time is between early 40s and early 60s, so we get the world war, the cold war, some Central American adventures, and the Bay of Pigs disaster as main historical material. Throw in some African scenery.
Unfortunately the build-up of the plot is very very slow. It takes very long until one can put the jig saw pieces in a framework that seems to make some sense. Also unfortunately, the considerable acting skills of Matt Damon are somewhat wasted on a character that is so low key that he hardly ever develops real contours, despite overlength. Maybe the only remarkable aspect of his character seems to be a fetish for women with hearing problems. His main love Laura is deaf, and his only other affair needs a hearing aid (his German secretary, played by Martina Gedeck). Also unfortunately, Angelina is largely underutilized as un-loved wife of the ever absent spy. (I do not think she handles her predicament badly though.) Possibly she hears too well for Mr. Wilson's taste.
De Niro directs, and adds himself as a physically handicapped intelligence general who looks remarkably like Kissinger (but calls himself a Catholic). There is also Joe Pesci as a strange Italian character whose only function seems to be to provide Damon with his best line in the movie. I can not quote what Pesci said to Damon, since it is racist and Amazon's censors don't let me quote that. Damon answers: we (i.e. the WASPs) own America, you other guys are just visiting.

I've only seen the film once, and I KNOW that there is so much going on within the long silences and wide plot twists that I need to see this more than twice to really get everything that's really going on.  It requires the sort of patience and intellectual effort that isn't for everyone, and will probably appeal to older viewers who remember what was going on when WWII went down and the insidious, paranoid years after the Bomb.  As for the acting, these stars pull off a gravity that most actors can only aspire to, and flesh out performances that suggest more than they state outright.  Subtlety is De Niro's way here.

I expected a James Bond type thriller with all the action, women, gadgets, etc. that we come to expect from films of that genre.  I was disappointed with the opening scenes of the film when it became apparent that the time frame was the Kennedy era, and I was thinking, oh great, no computers, no cells phones, and no gadgets are going to add up to boring.....

As the movie unfolded, I was pleasantly surprised that the subject matter of how the CIA was formed was presented in an interesting, intriguing,
and intelligent manner.  All the actors and director, Robert DeNiro, deserve much praise with this effort.

The movie follows the life of the lead character Edward Wilson as an US foreign ops agent. It is very well written and directed. The plot is deep and the visuals are very detailed.

This rates as 7 on the good movie scale, 3 on the bad movie scale, and is worthy of being added to my dvd collection. If I were to rate this on Yahoo! movies, it'd get an A-/B+ rating.

It does get points on the bad movie scale because I thought that the role Edward's son was very disjointed. I disbelieved that by his meek, fearful, and lack of a distinct personality alone, he wouldn't be able to get into Yale or the exclusive Skull & Bones secret society, or even had the chance to fall madly in love with a black Russian operative during that time period (pre-civil rights movement).

Based ona semi-real characters dealing with the first twenty years or so of the CIA the historical narrative and view into the 'old boys network' of the WASP elite that ran the CIA after the OSS was wrapped up in the wake of World War Two, this protrait is good. However the back story of a bunch of agents analyzing a tape in the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs failure and eventually tracking down the 'mole' only to run into a bunch of James Bond like double-agents is tragic.

The opening is so steeped in America's the past 60 years of our history, I wondered how many in the contemporary audience would get the connections.  Apparently WW2, Skull & Bones as the Masons for WASPs, the Cold War, Castro & the Mafia, American corporate interests controling Central America, the Bay of Pigs, the Kennedy administration in general, the LeCarre tradition, etc. are lost on the generation for whom ""ancient history"" means reruns of the first season of AMERICAN IDOL.

The scene with Joe Pesci is also a visual paean to GODFATHER 2 (birthday cake not included), and contains one of the two major punchlines worthy of Arnold, Clint, or the ending of the original STEPFORD WIVES (""Disney, why do you do this?""  ""Because we can."").  Pesci's mafioso observes the cultural pleasures of the Italians, the Irish, and so on, and then asks Damon's Company man what American WASPs can call THEIR own.  The response is delivered flawlessly.  The other killer one-liner comes at the end of the movie.

Haplessly, as with so many contemporary films, the movie ends about a dozen times before the final fade-out.  The tempered pacing and lapping-waves music make the film a mite long.  But the pay-offs are generally worth it, and it ultimately satisfies as might a thick, well-written novel.

The cast is excellent, and the boy who plays the son holds his own among a bevy of heavy hitters.  But I do wish DeNiro had taken a tip from GIANT (1956) when it came to the ageing make-up.  Matt and Angelina, especially, should have gotten a bit thicker in the waist and facially lined or hair-streaked as they aged.  More than once Matt looks younger than his adolescent son, more like a date than a parent.

An origami of endings and glam-glam make-up aside, this is a pleasing film for adults, with a sly dig at current American torture techniques proving much more effective than a similar scene in SYRIANA.",1168992000,14,2036,4.777142857142858

2752222,4,B000MXPE7Y,"Robert De Niro's second directorial effort ""The Good Shepherd"" purports to tell the story of the birth of the CIA during the heyday of the Cold War.  Based very loosely on the lives of two intelligence officers, James Jesus Angleton and Richard M. Bissell Jr., the movie is a strong but patience-demanding work that will have some members of the audience sitting up in rapt attention while others squirm restlessly in their seats.  At 168 minutes and with little real action to speak of, ""The Good Shepherd"" is admittedly not the easiest sell for a mass audience, relying as it does on atmosphere and dialogue - and the patient goodwill of its viewers - to get its message across.  I can easily imagine a person watching this film with one eye planted firmly on his wristwatch and the other on the theater exit.  I'm happy to report that I was not one of those people, for despite a few longueurs that occur towards the end of the movie, I found this film to be both compelling and eminently watchable for most of its duration.

Matt Damon, who ages remarkably little throughout the 23-year time span covered by the story, plays Edward Bell Wilson, an agent specializing in the fine art of counterintelligence.  With a screenplay by Eric Roth, the movie uses as its framing device the Bay of Pigs fiasco in the spring of 1961 and the suspicion that a mole in the agency must have tipped the Cubans off as to the American government's plan of invasion.  From there we flash back to 1939 where we meet Wilson as a student at Yale recruited by the FBI to perform surveillance on a poetry professor with possible ties to the then-burgeoning Nazi Party.  From then on, the film traces the arc of Wilson's life as he gets rooked into a largely loveless marriage (if one can call having to marry Angelina Jolie being ""rooked""), trains as an agent with British Intelligence and then the O.S.S., then helps to lay the groundwork for the American ""peace time"" organization known as the C.I.A.  The movie cuts back and forth between the two different time periods with only a few moments of confusion evident along the way.

Wilson is probably the most button-downed, completely internalized character to hit the screen since Heath Ledger's Ennis del Mar in ""Brokeback Mountain"" (though the character here is not nearly as fully realized as that one was).  Wilson is a man almost totally devoid of humor and emotions - in many ways, the ideal person for the life of commitment and loneliness that spy work, by its very nature, demands.  Wilson barely cracks a smile throughout the course of the story, and he is so thoroughly absorbed in his work that he doesn't see his wife and young son for literally years at a stretch.  Wilson is surely one of the least audience-friendly of recent movie protagonists - or at least he would be if Damon did not convey the sort of puppy-dog vulnerability that actually makes us care about the character.  Despite the fact that we know he has dedicated his life to a cause that he considers worthwhile and noble, we have a hard time approving of the way he treats his wife and family.  Yet, Damon is able so show us that Wilson is not all that crazy about himself either and that he would lead a different life if only he were able to crawl out of his own skin and start all over.  But this he cannot do, so he remains locked in his fate, true to what he knows how to do and hoping for a little redemption at the end if the gods should deem him worthy of that blessing.  Damon plays his cards so close to the vest that he makes us continually re-evaluate the character without ever revealing more than we need to know about him.  Wilson may at times be taking stock of his life, but the filmmakers don't feel the need to blatantly spell all the details out for us.  It's in what's going on BEHIND those bespectacled eyes that the true drama lies.

The movie does not shy away from the ugly realities of life as a CIA agent, showing us the cold-blooded ruthlessness and mounting paranoia that come with any life built, as this one is, on deception and distrust.

Rather than aiming his film at the action crowd, De Niro has decided to focus on the characters and dialogue and simply hope that his audience will follow along with him.  As a director, he brings a quiet, subdued tone to the story, the better to match the persona of his main character.  In order to create a mood of contrasting emotions, cinematographer Robert Richardson uses a dull palette for the scenes set in the present, and a glowing, sepia-toned look for those set in the past.

De Niro has assembled a veritable who's who of Hollywood's biggest and brightest to flesh out the minor roles - William Hurt, Alec Baldwin, Billy Crudup, Timothy Hutton, John Turturro, Joe Pesci, even De Niro himself - but, frankly, their parts are so limited that none truly stands out, thus clearing the way for Damon to take center stage.  Jolie has rarely looked so dreamily beautiful before, but even her screen time is too minimal for her to make more than a glancing impact on the film as a whole (it`s hard to believe any man would be as callously indifferent to the Jolie charm as Damon is here, but then, hey, that`s Hollywood).

This is clearly Damon's film and he proves once again that acting does not need to be ""theatrical"" and ""showy"" to be effective.  His performance is the glue that holds this long, potentially unwieldy film together.",1168387200,4,5430,4.553956834532374
2752223,2,B000MXPE7Y,"""The Good Shepherd"" is a stunning bore, a three-hour dud chronicling the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency. Like its main character, the movie insists on marching through the story with a blank-faced, downward-cast look toward the ground. Maybe it succeeds as history. But it fails, utterly, as entertainment.

In a committed and thus dull performance, Matt Damon is Edward Wilson, a wonkish Yale grad who's recruited into the CIA by a paralytic general (Robert DeNiro) and a smarmy power broker (William Hurt) to run counterintelligence; that is, infiltrate the communists. The CIA and Russian KGB spent a lot of lives moving them around their global chessboards; Wilson, a secretive, opaque soul, is a perfect fit.

Eric Roth's screenplay starts with the Bay of Pigs debacle, as Wilson tries to find the leak that doomed the 1961 mission, and works in flashback to 1939, when Wilson is forced to ditch his deaf sweetheart (Tammy Blanchard) to marry the pregnant Clover (Angelina Jolie), the sister of a classmate. Jolie is ludicrous, all sex, tears, aggression and jeers - the long-suffering wife trapped in a Bette Davis melodrama.

DeNiro also directs, pushing the gas on that musical score and dividing the action into inert two-minute chunks. His camera won't linger or deepen our experience, chained, as it is, to Roth's dense, I-did-my-homework screenplay. DeNiro assembled gifted players - Hurt, John Turturro, Michael Gambon, Billy Crudup, Alec Baldwin, Joe Pesci - and gave them very little motivation. It shows.

Roth and DeNiro seem bent on demystifying the CIA and debunking James Bond, Tom Clancy, John Le Carre, ""Casablanca"" and just about every other artistic foray into the field. Fine. But don't stuff Jolie in there and have us expect credulity. Better yet, watch ""Munich"" on a loop and see how it's done.",1168214400,3,1835,5.127090301003345
2752224,4,B000MXPE7Y,"In director Robert DeNiro's ambitious film, the professional rise and spiritual fall of Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) through the ranks of the CIA reflects the evolution of that organization from its creation in the wake of WWII until the debacle at the Bay of Pigs.  The character of Wilson is much like the film itself: enigmatic, quiet, and tightly controlled.  Some may be put off by the long running time and the lack of big action scenes, but more patient viewers will be rewarded with a compelling presentation of the psychological damage caused when mistrust is the normal state of human interaction.  Wilson emerges as a tragic figure, having gone into government service with the best of intentions but, step by step, coming to the point where he becomes responsible for horrific acts.

DeNiro does a fine job in his second film as a director.  He has assembled an excellent cast, including some outstanding cameos.",1168128000,3,922,4.922580645161291
2752225,5,B000MXPE7Y,"The Good Shepherd is full of twists and mystery and tension that will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire movie.  Matt Damon plays a CIA counter intelligence agent who gets roped into service the first time while still a student at Yale, being forced to choose between a professor and his country in the 1930's during the Nazi buildup, before war actually started.  He becomes more and more involved in the secret Skull and Bones Society at Yale, and gets recruited for more intelligence work during the war.  He goes, largely because he sees an escape from a personal life that isn't going the way he'd like.

He returns six years later, having made a successful name for himself as silent, icy, and incredibly loyal.  But his career success comes at the expense of his family and personal relationships.  In the end he has to make a gut-wrenching choice, and figure out a way to protect everyone he loves.

The movie can be hard to follow, mostly because it jumps around in time quite a bit.  The movie opens with the Bay of Pigs debacle, and then goes back to show events leading up to that event and beyond,  with everyone trying to figure out who the mole was.

It does a good job of exploring all of the family dynamics, without losing any of the intensity and mystery.  The acting was superb.  The characters could seem just one-dimensional, but I think that's because you have to be that way when you're a CIA spy.

2752227,4,B000MXPE7Y,"Robert DeNiro is considered by many to be one of the finest actors working in film. Naturally, after playing the number of diverse, challenging roles he has brought to the big screen, he is looking for new challenges. As someone working in film, one of those challenges is directing. Rather than play it safe, DeNiro takes on the complex tale of the birth of the CIA in ""The Good Shepherd"".

April, 1961. The Bay of Pigs is a disaster and Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) returns to Washington, DC as President Kennedy prepares to do some damage control and avert World War III. As he contemplates how the leak may have occurred, he begins to think back to his college days at Yale. Recruited into the secret Skull & Bones society, Edward soon becomes a full fledged member, trying to remain loyal to his fraternity brothers. At one of the society's retreats, he meets Clover (Angelina Jolie), the sister of his friend, John Russell (Gabriel Macht), the son of a Senator (Keir Dullea), who are also members of the society. Clover throws herself at Edward and a couple of weeks later, she announces she is pregnant and she and Edward are soon married. As World War II looms, Edward is approached by General Sullivan (Robert DeNiro), who wants a select group of men to travel to Europe to perform counter intelligence. After they return, Edward meets his son and the counter intelligence operations continue, becoming the basis of the Central Intelligence Agency, under the direction of Phillip Allen (William Hurt). Throughout his life, Edward faces challenges to his family life, patriotism and loyalty.

""The Good Shepherd"" is a difficult thing to discuss. At over 2 hours and 45 minutes, the film covers a lot of territory and presents a lot of detail and both director DeNiro and writer Eric Roth (""Munich"", ""Ali"", ""The Insider"", ""Forrest Gump"") have done a great job of keeping all of this information accessible and easy to follow. You never feel as though you are drowning in story, details or characters, and there are many I didn't even mention.

Matt Damon's performance as Edward is interesting. Extremely modulated, he almost never changes the tone of his voice. This does two things; on the one hand, it perfectly conveys his constant unease with his role in society and what he does but on the other hand, it makes his performance slightly boring. You want Damon to speak up, yell, cry, and do something other than stare impassively at someone else. I get that he is playing a spy, and is supposed to remain very aloof, but he is also playing a human. The few times he does yell or shout light up the screen and show us the potential of this character. I understand why it didn't happen more, but if it had, the character would have gone from just good to near great.

Anjelina Jolie plays Clover, or Margaret, the precocious daughter of a US Senator (Keir Dullea). From the moment we first meet her, she throws herself at Edward in a determined effort to snare him. As the story evolves, they are soon married and Edward is off to War, leaving her to give birth to their son alone. Later in the film, she complains about being left alone, about how he never loved her, etc. Her role resembles the old fashioned `vamp' type of role. I recently saw some `Pre Code' films made by Hollywood in the early 30s. In these films, Barbara Stanwyck, Jean Harlow and the like, play `upwardly mobile' women determined to sleep their way to the top. In ""The Good Shepherd"", Jolie's Margaret seems determined to mate with Edward. If this is, in fact, the case, we never really learn why.

The film is filled with a veritable who's who of memorable character actors. Michael Gambon plays one of Edward's Yale professors, who may have a thing for young men. Alec Baldwin plays Sam Murach, a member of the FBI who initially approaches Edward with an assignment. Billy Crudup plays Arch Cummings, a British spy who helps train Edward. William Hurt plays Phillip Allen, the man who helps found the CIA and guide the organization in its first few years. Timothy Hutton, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci and John Turtorro also pop up as various pieces of the puzzle. Some of these supporting characters are more involving and more interesting than others; Gambon stands out as an integral part of the story. As a poetry professor, guiding Edward in his thesis, he makes a pass at Edward who rejects. But this professor plays an important part in the overall story and finding out how he fits in is part of the fun. Alec Baldwin pops up repeatedly as sort of a guardian angel for Edward, guiding him towards the truth. John Turturro plays Edward's assistant, working with him through the decades as they work through one crisis after another. Other characters pop up briefly and then disappear. Joe Pesci plays a gangster ousted from Cuba when Castro takes over. Edward turns to him for help and guidance before the Bay of Pigs operation. The role is interesting, but way too brief and more of a distraction than anything. Oh, look. It's Joe Pesci.

""The Good Shepherd"" works best when it concentrates on the mechanics of the story, showing us how this agency was created, some of the activities it participated in, the like. From the moment Edward enters Yale, he seems destined to follow in his father's footsteps and become a member of the super secretive ""Skull and Bones"" society. We watch as Edward participates in the initiation and then his first interaction with Murach (Baldwin), in 1939. Murach wants him to give him a list of people who may be Nazi sympathizers. Edward's patriotism is never at question, so he does what he needs to do. Then, General Sullivan (DeNiro), also a member of ""Skull and Bones"", asks him to do counter intelligence work in London during World War II. There, he works with Cummings (Crudup) and others to learn about their methods and provide any help he can. Here, he begins a long and trusting relationship with his assistant (Turturro). Upon his return home, Sullivan asks him to continue the work with the new CIA, which will be headed by another member of ""Skull and Bones"", Philip Allen (Hurt). The film goes to great lengths to successfully show us the wheeling - dealing that went on behind the scenes during the formation of this agency.

Then the story shifts and we start to watch some of the operations they were involved in. These are presented as vignettes, of a sort, and they all lead to Castro and the Bay of Pigs. DeNiro and Roth use these events to illustrate the long term problems the CIA and other agencies of its type create for themselves and us. As the CIA becomes more involved in foreign governments, they sometimes make the wrong decisions, which proves troublesome to our country at later points.

The last act of the film, which details the Bay of Pigs operation and the resulting fiasco it creates, also involves Edward and Margaret's son, Edward Junior (Eddie Redmayne Jr.), now a young man who is also a part of the CIA. Throughout the film, as Edward steps back into the lives of his wife and son, we watch the boy grow up, insecure, always looking for his father's approval. As a member of the CIA, he is no different. This part of the story was the least successful simply because I found the performance by Redmayne to be fairly one note as well. In one scene, his expression is blank. In the next, he is mad at his dad. In another, another argument. In yet another, the blank expression returns. It is also difficult to believe Damon and Jolie's characters would father a grown son as they look pretty much the same throughout. The one concession to age seems to be a little bit of powder on Jolie's face and she appears to be tired. But they don't really age so it is startling to watch this character grow up as they stay relatively the same age.

DeNiro is clearly a talented director, and he is working with a story he has a great deal of interest in. It is also nice to see a film depict such a secretive organization `warts and all'. What the film shows doesn't appear to be sugar coated; we see the good and the bad. And that's a good thing. But as an actor, it seems like he would be able to realize the majority of the performances in the film are lifeless and cold. The most emotional characters are either the least mature, or the most harassed, as two Russian spies turn on the emotions as they plea for their life.

""The Good Shepherd"" is worth your time, and it will take a lot of it, but it will be stingy in the rewards. You will learn a lot about the operations, but little about the people behind the early days of the Central Intelligence Agency.",1167696000,6,8618,4.612125162972621
2752228,4,B000MXPE7Y,"Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson, a Yale graduate who enters the world of clandestine intelligence with the best of intentions, only to be overwhelmed by it.  This movie is long but does not lose one's interest.  We see how Edward Wilson is slowly transformed from an dedicated college graduate eager to help the O.S.S. againt Nazism to a determined C.I.A. case officer determined to stop communism to an emotionless cold warrior who will put the well-being of the country and his beliefs above his own family.

This is an interesting film.  Violence is down-played, people expecting another Bourne Identity or James Bond movie will be disappointed (as some of these reviews show).  It should be pointed out that The Good Shepherd is not meant to be an action film, but instead a drama film, a film that is oriented around the development of the Edward Wilson.  We are made to understand why he does what he does, why he feels as he feels.  I give this film a definite thumbs-up and predict Matt Damon will be nominated for an oscar for his performance.",1167609600,3,1051,4.7103825136612025
2752229,5,B000MXPE7Y,"This is a great film and one that I highly recommend, but it is not without flaws.  I won't rehash th plot because other reviewers have already done a much better job than I could do. But first the flaws and these are truly minor.  The costuming and set design were very well done, but Matt Damon's makeup was poor.  We watched him over a period of 30+ years and he never gained weight, turned gray, lost hair, or showed any sign of age, unlike Joilie who looked more mature at the end than she did at the beginning. The sound could have been better because some lines were muffled and in this film every line is important.  The organization of the film -- which is done in flashbacks -- could be better because it was hard to track the sequence of events but the footnotes in the corner helped, but if you miss one you are at sea as to what is going on.

Nevertheless, this is an excellent film and Matt Damon does a good job and the story is very similar to the George Smiley Tinker Tailor Spy.  Alec Guniness is more convincing as a spymaster but the destruction of Edward Wilson is more easily observed than with George Smiley but both characters end as The Walking Dead -- hollow men, wrapped in honor but devoid of family, friends, intimacy, trust, or anything worth living for other than God and Country.

I thought this film really brought forth the reality that our government is dominated by the Ivy League Patricians.  This has been true throughout the 20th Century and it is this ""old boy"" network that has created compromised politicians, led to corruption in government, and has placed the country at risk on more than one occasion.

The movie presents a variety of moral and ethical decisions which makes this film a good one to watch and discuss with your teenage children.  Edward Wilson's march to personal destruction is determined by individual decisions -- some small -- like the sexual encounter with Clover, which had disastrous results -- and some large -- like the decision to join the OSS.  The decision to spy on his professor was an ethical one but one that characterized Edward Wilson as a man who placed country above himself.  This dedication ultimately leads him to the heart rending decision regarding his son, which leaves him compromised.  This is a film with very complex characters whose motives are deep rooted and not easily discerned during the movie itself, but become clearer on reflection.  It vividly demonstrates the corrosiveness of secrets - especially on families.

Some of the reviewers didn't like the film because it was too slow and too long.  It has a slow pace -- but these are spies not Tom Cruise on a ""Mission Impossible"" more aptly titled a ""Mission Improbable"".  It has no car chases, bombs, babes, or any of the usual fare that appeals to the adolescent mind. This is a thinking man's movie and an exceptional one at that.  It definitely deserves the 5 stars.",1167523200,6,2919,4.613152804642167
2752230,5,B000MXPE7Y,"Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) is a somber, quiet man. Every morning he leaves his middle class home in the suburbs and along with his neighbors boards a bus for downtown D.C. But unlike his neighbors, who presumably work as office functionaries, Wilson is a top, experienced, ""higher-up"" for the C.I.A. and though, on the surface dressed exactly like his neighbors in felt fedora and Sears trench coats, Wilson is headed for the monolith that is the C.I.A. headquarters.
As written by Eric Roth and directed by Robert De Niro (De Niro's only other directing job was ""A Bronx Tale""), ""The Good Shepherd"" traces the genesis of the C.I.A. as it evolves from the World War II O.S.S. and central to this terrific, fascinating, intelligently written and passionately directed movie is the story of Wilson himself and the ultimate tragedy of his life: a life that begins to unravel the moment he agrees to become a spy right out of college.
Wilson, as portrayed by Matt Damon is the perfect spy if there is such a thing: he is without humor, looks like a thousand other men, dresses like a small town banker and is passionate about only two things: his son and his miniature ship in a bottle hobby. And anytime he strays from these two things, as in women or sex, he fails miserably.
The world of Espionage is a dirty business, one that defies and twists the basic notions of truth, loyalty and pride. For Wilson there is almost no room for anything else: upon marrying he leaves his pregnant girlfriend, Clover(Angelina Jolie) for six years to serve in Europe without thinking about it twice.  His life is his work and his work ultimately ruins his life by chipping away at the basic goodness and humanity that infuses his core self. By the end of this film, he is used up...hollow.
""The Good Shepherd"" moves back and forward in time from Wilson's initiation into the Skulls and Bones at Yale through the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961 and though the running time is approximately three hours, you are never bored for on the one hand, De Niro keeps things moving quickly and on the other the subject matter is rife with conflict, mystery and operates on the very highest level of commitment and interest.",1167264000,65,2191,4.661498708010336
2752231,5,B000MXPE7Y,"The Good Shepherd is a fascinating look at how the counterintelligence unit of the CIA began. Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson, a priviledged Yale graduate and former Skull and Bones member who is recruited to help the United States stave off the growing threat of communism both to our East and later our South. The movie centers around the botched Bay of Pigs invasion and how and why our mission in Cuba failed. Much of the film is told through flashbacks as Wilson trys to determine how and why this mission has failed. The pacing of the film is slow, but the plot is layered, intricate and engrossing. Damon does an admirable job as Edward Wilson, he is as cold and calculating a character as I can ever remember on the screen. A man of very few words even when it comes to his wife and child. Obviously this affects his marriage but the film thankfully does not overbear on this point. For anyone whose read about CIA interrogation tactics, this movie will not shock or surprise you. Overall, a look inside of one of the most secretive organizations in American history should be reason enough for you to see this film, but if it's not then the superb acting and direction of De Niro will nonetheless draw you to see The Good Shepherd.
