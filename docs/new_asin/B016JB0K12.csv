7473188,3,B016JB0K12,"Julia is a Rape revenge thriller that has some very violent , bloody moments .The acting by the main players was good enough,  (Ashley C.Williams) as Julia being the star and stand out.

The story revolves around Julia a timid girl who works as a plastic surgeon's assistant. She is invited on a date one night , drugged, gang raped,beaten. Wrapped in plastic,and left for dead. She manages to get home to heal. Taking a week off from work.

She visits a strange bar and overhears women talking about a form of therapy that will help her mend her mental scars. The leader or ""doctor"" has some very brutal and unorthodox ways of getting revenge. Most involving castrastion. It's like a cultish Secret society.

The story takes an even darker turn as Julia and her new friend (Sadie) work together trapping the men one by one .Developing a lesbian relationship along the way. It's violent and bloody and there are a couple scenes of gore ,although most of the direct violence happens off screen and we see the aftermath and a couple of scenes are pretty graphic.

The musical score is very effective bringing the film to life! The lighting is somewhat dark but it works in It's favor. I enjoyed parts of(Julia) but it wasn't quite consistent .I really  enjoyed the last 20 minutes or so. Because some of the film was a bit muddled in the middle.

There is a surprise or I should say sort of revelation about the doctor who tries to help Julia. She's also told never to exact revenge on her own which she ignores ,breaks free and does .It's a decent atmospheric thriller but doesn't quite fully satisfy.",1454457600,3,1600,4.5929824561403505

7473206,4,B016JB0K12,"This is a somewhat unusual rape-revenge movie. It has all the telltale signs of the films that came before it, but they do some things differently that were actually quite intriguing. The acting is pretty good and the lead in particular was excellent. The direction was also pretty good and aside from some minor pacing issues, it was solid. The story is a definite high point and utilized a pretty unique form of revenge for the victim, which I greatly enjoyed. To be honest, this movie is about 30% original thought and 70% retread of other rape-revenge movies, but it works. This is a bloody and gritty movie that I definitely enjoyed. 3.5/5",1455408000,4,644,4.707964601769912
7473207,2,B016JB0K12,"Nurse Julia (Ashley C. Williams) gets drugged, gang raped, and left for dead. She doesn't report the crime and overhears some women talking about a new therapy. Julia is taken in and is given new self esteem and is told not to take revenge and make it personal. However, being a New Yorker, Julia has got ""your personal"", right here. This is an artsy ""I Spit on Your Grave.""

F-bomb, rape, nudity (Ashley C. Williams)",1454889600,,417,4.56

It was black aside from absolutely pointless gruesome violence. The music added the shear pathetic quality of this waste of time and money. Please if you can't find anything to watch, listen to music because this freak show is absolute garbage",1532131200,,401,4.506849315068493

If you want something with a dark intensity to it, this is one to watch.  To top it off, another absolutely stunning performance from Ashley C. Williams!",1476316800,,324,4.193548387096774
