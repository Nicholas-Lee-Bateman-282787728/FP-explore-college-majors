8186582,5,B000OT8NGU,"I've had this anthology on VHS for several years, and watched it again and again over the years.  It has four wickedly original, well photographed (on film) short stories full of dark humor throughout.  It is hosted by a couple of guys imitating Siskel and Ebert, who provide silly interludes between films.  The first film, ""Dr Dobermind"" is about a girl whose life is haunted by this strange character, who causes her to see strange visions, like her face decomposing in the mirror (great effect).  ""Night Fright"" is about a boy who can't convince his parents that there's a monster in his room (good creature effects).  ""Illegal Alien"" is of course a takeoff on Alien, but done with a great deal of satire.  The outer space scenes are top notch, and you will howl at the people impersonating the crew of the ""Nostromo"" type ship. It's better than a similar farce, Hardware Wars, in my opinion.  ""The Thing in The Basement"" rounds off the show with four Canadian type beer chuggers playing cards when suddenly a meteor crashes through the roof and lands in the basement.  It morphs into an alien that starts zapping them with a ray gun.  Excellent direction provides a thrill a moment as they fight it off.  Good Alien creature.  Can't say enough about these films, other than see them for yourself and relive an age where originality of design dwarfs the empty spfx of today.",1393200000,,1378,4.7
