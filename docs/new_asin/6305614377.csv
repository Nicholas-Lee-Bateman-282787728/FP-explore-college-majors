1056205,5,6305614377,"As another reviewer has already mentioned, Callas was never filmed in a complete opera. (Ironically, no less than three films exist of the second act of Puccini's Tosca, a role that she did not regard with particular favor.) So, these filmed live concerts of varied operatic repertory are particularly valuable as a document of a spellbinding performer practicing her art. The concert from 1959 finds her in more secure voice, though she misses a top C in the Macbeth aria and omits some interpolated high notes elsewhere. However, the earlier concert as a whole is a vivid demonstration of her dramatic intensity and the variety of her vocal art, ranging from the steely intensity of Macbeth, to the ineffable grief of the Don Carlo aria, to the flirtatious charm of the Barber of Seville. By 1962, she was in noticeable vocal decline and there are frequent instances of what became an all-too-familiar unsteadiness on top notes in the later concert. She also has difficulty remembering words in the Carmen excerpts in 1962. On the other hand, O Don Fatale, a mezzo aria, is mesmerizing. Anyone who wants to learn why Callas continues to exert such a powerful force on the world of opera need only view these concerts to know the reason.",972950400,33,1238,4.84433962264151
1056206,5,6305614377,"Watching and listening to Maria Callas through DVD technology was a very intense artistic experience for me, and a fulfillment of my expectations. Maria Callas gets completely into a character after a few notes by the orchestra. Sometimes she sings one word in a certain mood and then the second word in a very different mood. In this way the character becomes richer and more human. She shows us most of the conflicts and contradictions that pass through our mind, especially in heroic situations. There is complete unity and synchronization between all the components: music, words, acting movement, and the situation of the characters. I do not know any other opera singer who can do all this as successfully as Maria does. She has the talent and sensitivity but especially the right attitude to her work. Maria is a wonderful actor, and on DVD the experience is more complete, enabling us to choose the subtitles, or to listen to a particular phrase once more for a full comprehension. You can not do this at a live concert, and it is much more difficult in video. Although it is not a complete opera, with DVD that includes music, visual means and words, Maria succeeds in taking us to the right mood and concentration in order to communicate the composer's ideas. You can also see on Maria's face how she enters into the right mood at the beginning of a piece. It is also interesting to watch her after the end of a piece. To me, it looks as if it is not the same person. With such a DVD Maria with her noble personality, can live forever.",962409600,2,1545,4.601449275362318
1056207,5,6305614377,"Maria Callas was a phenomenon.  She evoked the strongest passions, pro and con, during her too brief peak period.  Unfortunately she did her best work in the 1950's and 1960's when films and videos of opera were rare.  That  makes this DVD so important.
Here we see her in two recitals.  Sadly  she was never filmed in a complete opera (to the best of my knowledge).  Like another one of the reviewers, I have watched these performances on  laser disc for years and was especially pleased to see them come out on  DVD.  The quality of the picture reflects the state of the art of the time.  But you will not buy this DVD for picture quality.  You will get it as a  visual and auditory record of the most interesting singer of the past 50  years.
There are many glorious moments on this DVD.  Perhaps my  favorite is Una voce poco fa from The Barber of Seville.  Her recording of  the complete opera on EMI is still one of the best versions of this opera,  but her aria in this recital is the best of her several recordings.  And  what presence she had.
As a lover of opera it is a disappointment that  I never got to see Callas perform live.  This superb DVD will have to be my  consolation.",952560000,28,1191,4.285067873303167
1056208,5,6305614377,"I have the Laser Disc version of this.  I bought it 7 years ago and has enjoyed it since.  The charm of Callas never let me down...always cheers me up...I have watched this hundreds of times and still loving it.  I plan to  get the DVD version very soon.  My favorite is her in ""O Don  Fatale""...look at her expression.  She went from sad, somber, to full  of joy.  She is truly the goddess of opera.",944697600,13,400,4.157894736842105
1056209,5,6305614377,"If you are a fan of Maria Callas, then you undoubtedly own the Hamburg Concerts on VHS format. If you love Maria Callas, then you're probably an audiophile, too! It's about time that Maria Callas' repertoire become  available on DVD. The actual DVD is fantastic. A full menu allows the  audeince to choose subtitles (in three languages) to the arias. A good  stereo or digital stereo gives new life to these familiar concerts. This  DVD is a must have for Callas fans!",943142400,17,468,4.670731707317073
1056210,5,6305614377,"This live performance video gives us the opportunity to see and hear Maria Callas in concert. She is magnificent! Every gesture, every phrase, every nuance of her finely honed performance is here for us to enjoy. I only wish  that someone had possessed the foresight to videotape one of her legendary  opera performances in it's entirety. That would have been something!",936230400,4,370,5.049180327868853
7892557,5,6305614377,"Thank heaven brief moments such as these captured in 1959 and 1962 have been preserved because only to hear Callas is to bask in but half of her unique genius. Her weight loss in 1953-54 has transformed her into, in the words of Rescigno, ""possibly the most beautiful lady on the stage"". And this DVD shows her with all of her incomparable gifts on display. The quintessential singer who could act and actress who could sing. All hail La Divina!!!",1488931200,,447,4.6
7892558,5,6305614377,"It's easy to dismiss the ridiculous critics of these concerts who pick apart Callas' missed high notes, precarious singing and enormous vibratto. This woman and her singing are beyond reproach, her acting is astonishing (especially as Lady Macbeth and as Imogene in 1959) - and this DVD is in desperate need of reissuing.

Callas is absolutely hypnotizing, singing mezzo arias by Verdi, Bellini and Bizet. Apart from her insanely effective acting, I find the most compelling aspect of her performance to be her deteriorating high register: any note above a high Bb was sung with tremendous vibratto, Callas' notorious wobble.

Still, that anyone rates the footage on this DVD - or indeed Callas' singing itself - as anything but genius is preposterous. This is a required document of the greatest singer and greatest actress in the history of recorded media.",1293840000,,858,5.121428571428571
7892559,4,6305614377,"Watching Maria Callas on video helped me appreciate her art more and also understand why her voice, especially after '54-'55, had the tortured quality many dislike. To my ears and confirmed by Robert Sutherland, her friend and accompanist, Callas sacrificed her technique for the sake of drama. The facial expressions, the gestures are all very impressive and show how dramatically committed she always was, but notice how she doesn't help herself breathe properly, or how openly she sings most vowels (especially the a, e and i). Robert Sutherland also noticed that her flawed technique often made her sing sharp on records and rehearsals. Moreover Callas quickly lost the roundness of her vowels (listen to the Macbeth scene and compare it to the '52 Scala performance). Some say the sacrifice was worth it; however, the very early Callas recordings have for me as much drama as the late ones, plus you get to enjoy a voice that was exciting, powerful and healthy.

One way or another her voice declined and the '59 recital captures her in rather bumpy voice and annoyingly pretentious stage attitude. Tu che invoco is compelling and sophisticated. Lady Macbeth has always been my favourite Callas role but by '59 her thin voice was no longer up to the challenge. She is still utterly convincing as the Lady but her instrument betrays her. The first C cracks hopelessly and the entire scene exhausts her. Rossini is a composer Callas should have invested in more. Her Rosina is a delight even if again the high notes are flapping. I can't get enough of her runs and cascades though. Callas fans have always adored her Elisabetta aria and the Pirata finale; these I'm afraid, are not my cup of tea. I prefer other sopranos in these pieces.

If I disliked her attitude on stage in Stuttgart, Callas in Hamburg seems like a different person. I don't know if it's due to her rapid vocal decline but here she looks lovely, calm and reserved. The repertoire is better too! The tessitura is lower and compliments Callas a lot. The French arias, especially Carmen, suit her personality and bring out the best of Callas. The same goes for Cenerentola, another role that displays Callas' excellence as a Rossini singer. Ernani's Elvira is a role I wish she had recorded completely and it's great to see her singing the opening aria in this recital. Eboli and not Elisabetta, is the kind of role Callas was born to sing. Her fiery O don fatale proves it. There are squally high notes in many places but because this exciting role suits her so well, I couldn't care less.

The '62 recital along with the '58 Paris production are my favourite Callas video performances. However, all of them are worth obtaining since we sadly have so little of Callas to watch.

I'm expecting the usual feedback by my ""Salieri"" Callas mates who don't seem to understand that one can like Callas without being blind or deaf.",1112400000,8,2895,4.784
7892560,5,6305614377,"This video proves only one thing, she is the best suprano in this universe. She does not only have the vocal quality but the great acting ability as well. To think this is just a recital but when Callas sings, she transforms to the character she is portraying. I could just imagine if we had a glimpse of her vocal quality when she started her career. La Divina Maria Callas the greatest of them all",1097798400,4,399,4.333333333333333
7892561,5,6305614377,"Not being the consummate ""opera queen,"" I'll spare you my thoughts on the technical aspects of Callas' voice. My primary exposure to opera is on record, and in that venue nobody in my opinion has come close to her. Listening to Callas is like being there, because she knew better than anyone how to ""act"" with her voice. In that sense, she's like a cheap date for the legions who can't afford real opera. To use a line from an old hippie song, a recording of Callas is like ""a ticket to ride."" What I find most remarkable about this double bill DVD is the striking metamorphosis in Callas when she shows up for the second concert in 1962. Bear in mind when you watch it that she had by now divorced her fatherly husband-mentor and become lovers with the Greek shipping tycoon, Aristotle Onassis. To say that she is a different woman would be an understatement. Suddenly the cold goddess of the woeful countenance has become a vivacious musical vixen. Sporting a stylish sixties haircut, and a sexy lowcut gown, she almost puts you in mind of Jacqueline Kennedy--but with more spirit. Woops! Did I inadvertantly mention her nemesis, who hijacked her boyfriend, thus ending one of the century's great romances, and sending La Callas' emotional life and career into a tailspin? Sorry. But for me, this may be the most compelling aspect of this remarkable video document. Watch it, and you will not only see a great artist in all her glory, you will witness history.",1089676800,9,1462,4.670542635658915
7892562,5,6305614377,"Hello again! This second review is about the second concert which it seems I have ignored in my first one. Maria in this tour in 1962 -which started in February in London and has been preserved in audio in a very bad sound- was in a good physical condition but her voice started to fail her in the high notes region. The wobble is obvious but she still gives more than any other opera singer could give in a live performance.
Her ""Pleurez mes yeux"" aria is heartbreaking. She does what she was doing especially in her Traviatas. She gives the impression that she will not be able to finish the aria because of the anguish and the torment of the character she is interpretting. She then sings two arias from Carmen and gives us a small idea of how Carmen would be if she would perform the whole role. She transforms Carmen in a very hard person in the whole, very secure and carefree. The ultimate perfection of interpretation of the character.  The aria from Ernani is not one of my favorites but she sings it with perfection. It's Verdi after all and it is easy for her....Then comes La Cenerentola which she also sings in a joyful style. I always watch twice the ""non piu mesta"" part. She fascinates me when she sings those scales and with much easiness... The last aria ""O don fatale"" comes from Don Carlo. In this aria one can see her acting skills in small periods. In the first part she is powerful, strong and angry while she curses her beauty. In the second part she is sad, asks for forgiveness and the voice is more passionate. And at last from a point of dreadful thoughts, comes joy!! Watch as her face from sad becomes happy and gives the phrase in full happiness...""Un di mi resta...lo salvero..."" that finishes with quite a fantastic way that makes people go mad. Callas la Divina in action!!!
About the first review of mine I would ask the previous, friend reviewer to read carefully the booklet of the DVD that he bought. I know that you my friend did not find her singing bad, so it came across that she had not caught a cold, but in the booklet also is said that Maria had a cold during that tour. I will tell you to focus on several  parts ` She was suffering from a cold at the beginning of this tour and the effects of it were still evident', `Callas several times sends worried glances in the direction of the conductor, presumably indicating that she is not happy with the way her voice is behaving. ', ` ...the effects of the cold become apparent when a top C fails to sound properly....' . I would also go a step ahead and recommend you to listen to the Stuttgart concert four days after her Hamburg performance to whiteness a really exhausted by the symptoms of a cold Callas... As a Callas collector I own it of course.  Thank you for your time.
I hope everyone enjoyed watching this DVD. It's like a legend coming alive in front of our eyes in a well preserved picture, thanks to EMI classics...:)",1083196800,5,2926,4.394833948339484
7892563,5,6305614377,"I didn't want to ""review"" this DVD, the 2nd concert of which I watched this morning, the 1st yesterday morning because I felt that much (too much) had been said already.  But I feel a compulsion.  To begin with, I only wanted to give it 4 stars (it definitely deserved that), but Callas was Callas, so 5.  I discovered Callas in a 2 LP set (which I still own an unopened copy of) in 1967, and have loved her ever since.  But I'd never until now seen her sing.  I'm sorry I did, though yesterday I ordered her Paris recital with the 2nd act of Tosca on it.  In the first concert (1959) I thought the woman was vain, pretentious, affected, conceited, and phony beyond belief from her introduction right up to the hand-kissing at the end.  I was shattered.  I hated everything I'd ever heard by her (and I've had a picture of her on my wall for years).  Sigh.  But in the 2nd concert (1962) she was (as god is my witness) just a very nice, humongously gifted woman doing her thing.  She smiled, laughed, made comical self-deprecating facial expressions at the ovations.  I loved her.  I was enchanted.  She sang, of course, like Callas.  That was the same.  No need to go into it.  I did not notice the effect of a cold in the first concert, and I in no way felt her voice had deteriorated by the 2nd one.  The video and audio were just fine.  I found her renowned ""acting"" a little tiresome (that's another reason I want the Tosca), but that is easily explained by the melodramatic, grandiose lyrics she was forced to sing.  (I watched the subtitles, and my esteem for these composers shot even higher than it had been before, to have actually composed such wonderful, beautiful music to such hyperbolic, repetitious tripe.  The poetry of the original may be beautiful, but the content of these 19th Century lyrics was terrible.  I've only seen 3 full operas, with subtitles, and on VHS and DVD, Boheme, Lucia and Hoffmann.  I don't recall their librettos being so dismal.  Incidentally, while I am passing familiar with a few popular plots (Butterfly, Rigoletto), I never read librettos or follow words to arias, I just listen to the music.)  If you love Callas and want to know how she looked when she sang, what she did, I highly recommend this DVD.  Only 2 major/minor quibbles.  I could have done without the 2 overtures and the orchestral music from Carmen, though it was pleasant, I wanted to hear Callas.  I would infinitely rather have heard the Gypsy Song (what ecstatic excitement from this singer) than either or both the prelude or entr-acte.  And I frankly would have liked to have chosen her arias for her, there are several (many) I would have preferred to hear.  Incidentally, unless these recitals had things left out of them, the audience didn't get much for its money, getting all dressed up, driving to the theater and all.  Each one lasted about an hour.  There was much hand kissing, flower throwing, walkings off and on stage, applause.  Maybe (probably) these are traditional European or operatic conventions.  Still, I found them a bit much.  But I still love Callas.  I'm eager to see the other DVD I ordered.  But I think in the future I'll stick to my CDs.  I really just like the voice and the music.",1082764800,2,3228,4.549565217391304
7892564,3,6305614377,"This DVD of the Callas 1959 Hamburg concert must be bought if you know people -- specially your children -- who never saw Callas on stage, and all they know is that La Divina sang a touching aria featured in the sound track of the film Philadelphia. As is known, even the most adoring critics of Callas write that she was  ""divine"", despite the terrible aspects of her singing, specially her disastrous high notes! The fact is that Callas was a rather good mezzo-soprano who insisted in offering her own version of coloratura operas, such as Lucia de Lammermoor, until Dame Joan Sutherland came along and set the record straight!
One of the most repeated fables is that the Callas live recordings are wonderful, because it was the adrenalin of facing a public that made her so dramatic and exciting to hear, whereas in studio recordings, with no public, the excitement was not present and only the defects in her voice were noticeable!
Well, watch and listen to this live concert. After her voice cracks in the top High C of the very second piece (recitative of Lady Machbeth's opening scene), you will discover that the adrenalin is there, alright! But not on her, on you! You become so nervous that she will not make the next notes, that when she does get to the end of the arias, after quite a few screeches, you jump up and applaud, just by being relieved of the tension! Something like seeing your team, after a poor day in the field, finally score the tying point at the very last second of the game.
By all means, buy this DVD to show to your juniors and then give them Renata Tebaldi CDs and Mirella Freni DVDs if they want an operatic education.",1061078400,4,1654,4.531772575250836

She is not only a soprano with supreme teceniques, but also a prima dona living in every characters she sings through her dramatic make-blelieve artistry. Without any knowledge of the lyrics, you understand the characters and the whole story behind them through the gestures and the facial expressions she made while singing in vivid emotions. You will never know Callas fully enough without seeing her singing.  A Must-Have for Callas fans, and, of course, for those who didn't understand yet to aprreciate this prima dona of the last century.",1036627200,6,601,5.01
