7455273,5,B016192060,"It was the two episodes on staring Superman and Wonder Woman and the Soccby-Doo Movies with Batman & Robin that gave us Super Friends, so for the first time officially released on DVD  you can now watch the original spots of the Super Friends.

Cindy's Super Friend:
Cindy meeting mild-mannered Clark Kent. The Brady Kids team up with the Man of Steel to paint a bank building during the city's ""Paint-Up"" week. The Wily Toulouse La Trick and his henchman Igor substitute delayed-action invisible paint so that when the bank becomes invisible they can rob it. Little do they realize that Clark Kent can change into Superman any time he can find a telephone booth.

It's All Greek To Men:
The Brady Kids meet Diana Prince (a.k.a. Wonder Woman) a University Mathematician where Jan and Marcia are in the age old debate of Brains over Brawn and Marlon's magic accidentally transports them all back in time to ancient Greece where they arrive right in time not only for the Olympic games but to meet the famous mathematician Euclid.

Lone Gone Silver:
Bobby is a fan of the Lone Ranger and orders a pin from his fan club. Marlon uses his magic to try to transform it into real silver but bring the Long Ranger's horse ""Silver"" to the tree house.

Super Friends first aired on ABC on September 8, 1973, featuring well-known DC characters Superman, Batman and Robin, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman. Superman, Batman and Robin and Aquaman had each previously appeared in their own animated series produced by Filmation, and voice talent from these prior programs was brought in to work on the new show. Shortly before the Super Friends series was developed, Superman and Wonder Woman also guest-starred in two episodes of The Brady Kids, while Batman and Robin appeared in two episodes of The New Scooby-Doo Movies.

7455274,4,B016192060,"I was only 4-6 years old when THE BRADY KIDS originally aired on ABC Saturday Mornings, but the fact it was based on one of the earliest Prime Time memories and was from the same animation studio that brought us The Archies, Sabrina and Fat Albert made it an early favorite. When the two CBS affiliates in my area reran these shows in 1981-82 opposite reruns of Josie and the Pussycats, I had trouble deciding and would flip back and forth between channels.

The best thing about this release is that, amazingly, CBS was able to clear all the songs used in the musical interludes (including the Lobo smash Me and You and a Dog Named Boo). Even mega-hit shows like Happy Days and Laverne & Shirley had some of their music cut on the DVD releases put out by CBS. The only bad thing is the cheesy magic-marker cover-art. Why did they not just use one of the Filmation cels and present the animated kids as we all remember them?

Now being middle-aged, these vintage 70s cartoons have lost some of their appeal for me, but viewing an episode or two here and there makes for mildly amusing nostalgia.",1455753600,15,1095,4.47
7455275,4,B016192060,"As Saturday Morning TV continued to bring different concepts to life,Fall 1972 was to change the look and quality of weekend viewing!
debuting as part of ""The ABC SATURDAY SUPERSTAR MOVIE"",""THE BRADY KIDS"" was the first official spin-off of ABC/Paramount TV's popular ""THE BRADY BUNCH"" series,that would eventually become a Franchise,spawning off more spinoffs based on Sherwood Schwartz's
beloved creation,since it's debut in 1969.  produced by Filmation Associates,the animated spinoff featured the cartoon likeness of all the main juvenile stars from the ABC series,as well as the original voices! ""F-TROOP"" co-star Larry Storch,who was later cast in ""THE GHOST BUSTERS"" live action series in Fall 1975 with Forest Tucker,was the voice of ""Marlon,the Mynah,as the Brady Kids got into their weekly
mishaps and occasional adventures,with the occasional visits from such guest stars such as ""Superman"",""Wonder Woman"", and ""The Lone Ranger"",their half hour cartoon show,was in it's own little world-and like ""THE ARCHIES"",another Filmation produced series at the same time period,The Brady Kids preformed all their music numbers,via animation stock footage originally produced for The Archies,and helped sell their music careers during the time of their weekly Primetime evening show!  most TV viewers didn't exactly warm-up to the idea of watching a cartoon version of the popular TV series,but for the two seasons of it's ABC Saturday morning run,""THE BRADY KIDS"" actually did very well,especially for Filmation Associates,who would win an Emmy award,for their 1973 version of ""STAR TREK"",and two years later,would also
bring another classic Sherwood Schwartz creation back to TV,in ""THE NEW ADVENTURES OF GILLIGAN"" in 1974,and later in 1982! this 1972-1973 Filmation cartoon series may not have been everybody's favorite show,but it did very well,despite the studio's limited budget,and it
became the first of many Brady spinoffs to follow over the years! i'd reccomend this animated series only for those,who knew and grew-up watching serious Saturday morning cartoons during the height of their success!",1454112000,18,2107,5.6645569620253164
7455286,5,B016192060,I don't have the Brady Bunch on DVD but I couldn't miss out on this memorable show... Brought back so many memories,1473811200,2,115,4.2727272727272725
7455287,5,B016192060,"Granted the show was just as lame and dated, but I've always enjoyed this take on the Brady Franchise. My favorite secondary character is the arrogant narcissst Chuck White.",1463702400,3,173,5.0
7455288,3,B016192060,I had forgotten how awful Filmation cartoons are until I purchased this DVD set.  I made it through 1.5 episodes before bailing.  It was fun to hear the original cast's voices but this cartoon is unwatchable.,1462406400,3,208,4.75
7455289,4,B016192060,"Source material isn't the greatest and there are no special features to speak of, but still a groovy walk down memory lane and the songs are fun, especially some of the more obscure ones.  Be aware that the last six episodes have replacement voices for Greg, Marcia and Peter...Barry, Maureen and Christopher were holding out for more money so other voices were used for their characters for the end of the series run.",1462147200,4,418,4.726027397260274
7455290,4,B016192060,"I enjoyed the series when it aired on ABC Saturday Mornings.  The Archie Band animation re-use was obvious and the same animated movements for the Brady kids and their pets were predictable as per Filmation's usual way of animation...it does keep the show memorable all these years, though.  It was fun listening to the Brady kids's voices in wacky adventures and interacting with Wonder Woman, Superman, and The Lone Ranger and Tonto.  Larry Storch was great in playing multiple voices as Marlon, the various supporting characters and The Bradys' human teen pals Chuck and Fleetwood as was Jane Webb as Babs, Miss Flugel the teacher, and all of the female adults.

Trivia note: Barry Williams, Maureen McCormick, and Chris Knight were involved in a contract dispute in the second season episodes and were replaced by producer Lou Scheimer's kids Lane Scheimer as Greg, Erika Scheimer as Marcia, and Keith Sutherland (son of animation director Hal?) as Peter.",1459900800,12,959,5.089171974522293

8735352,5,B016192060,"Since I became a big Brady fan than I was before, I really wanted to have this since I've seen reruns of this on TV Land back in the late 90's.  The music heard on here is groovy and I love it!  You'll even get some songs that y'all may of heard on The Brady Bunch.  If you're a Brady fan or of Filmation (the studio that produced this along with Paramount), definitely look into this.  Oh, and you'll see special appearances by Superman, Wonder Woman and The Lone Ranger as well.",1503187200,,480,4.184782608695652
8735353,5,B016192060,"I watched this back from the moment it made its official debut on Saturday morning television, and throughout my life I proceeded to rewatch it again and again and again every single time it was rerun.

And now after a lifetime I finally have the pleasure of owning it on DVD. ;)

Unlike The Archies cartoon, The Brady Kids was blessed with cool songwriting for its musical interludes, which of course were always the highlights of all the episodes. For those who haven't heard the entire song catalogue before, the music is genuinely enjoyable and at times even filled with surprisingly touchinv depth and insightful maturity (""Come Run With Me"" and ""Playing The Field"", for example). With music like this, it's no surprise that the Bradys' albums featuring the material have reigned supreme as beloved collectors' items by music fans for decades now. And the goofy episodes are still as enjoyably silly as ever. It's hard for me to imagine anyone not being charmed by its seventies aura.

Presented in TV-style full screen (natch), this is a very basic release; you basically get all the episodes and nothing else. The menu is absolutely nothing fancy tech-wise and simply gets the job done, but it's easy on the eyes and is easy to navigate. The episodes, sadly, don't appear to have been touched up at all. However, they *are* reproduced in the same condition as they were wheneved they aired on television throughout the years, and I haven't noticed any glitches. By comparison, the ultracool ""Jackson 5"" cartoon set, while beautifully reproduced with superb packaging and brightly restored colors, suffered a few technical glitches here and there visually (see my review for details).

All that said, the episodes do appear to be in better viewing condition than in the ""Mission:Magic"" set, which appeared to be a bit more dingy in comparison to this.

Interestingly, the original CBS logo at the end of each episode has been replaced with an ultramodern high tech which is simply glaring when placed within the rest of the closing credits sequence.

Also oddly, Ping and Pong's faux Chinese has been doubled in its loudness. Why, I don't know, but it does make listening to them a bit grating; I'd always loved the two pandas, but their vocals' being twice as loud does take some getting used to. What originally sounded cute now threatens to sound somewhat impenetrable.

Nevertheless, The Brady Kids remains a wonderful trip back in time to a simpler era, a time when Saturday mornings truly were super and The Bradys brightened up homes everywhere with their groovy funshine and delightful music.",1500076800,3,2606,4.936073059360731

8735357,4,B016192060,"This was a fun T.V. Show to watch when I was a kid. I had seen The Brady Bunch T.V. Show and I believe this was the first 'Spin Off' from that. The show featured a Talking Mynah Bird named Marlon who could do magic - sort of, His bungles are usually fuel for their adventures. Also 'Ping and Pong' the pandas who speak in rapid-fire Chinese. The show was notable for two firsts: 1) the first appearance of Wonder Woman in an animated form. 2) Introducing a new character which became a 'Spin-Off' for a cartoon series Ep# 19 Teacher's Pet introduced Miss Tickle a magical school teacher who would take her Adventurer's Club to join an animated Rick Springfield in the worlds beyond the blackboard in MISSION: Magic!",1480204800,2,715,4.507692307692308
