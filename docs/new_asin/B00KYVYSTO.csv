8662741,5,B00KYVYSTO,"A beautiful movie. The problems addressed are real, and this film portrays them without cheap sentimentalism. The story is true and the people portrayed are real people -- and the acting makes them truly come alive for the watcher. It's a wonderful reminder of what miracles can occur when we submit ourselves to God's will and how our availability is more important than our ability.

And watch out for Avan Jogia. He plays this role so real that nothing but the character remains -- the actor disappears. I don't think it will be long until he is recognized widely as a power house of an actor.",1449878400,5,596,4.622641509433962
