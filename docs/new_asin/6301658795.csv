346204,5,6301658795,"Contrary to some comments on this list, this film is not a documentary or concert film. It is a visionary work of art. It's like Robert Franks' book THE AMERICANS coming to life. If you don't know what that is about, see for  yourself. This is the America that Kerouac loved. And if you don't know  what that means, find out before it's too late.
This film is really about  a summers day in America in 1958. As a musician, a Jazz lover, a poet and a  film buff, this film is the best of all worlds. It is pure poetry. It is  like seeing the world through Kerouac's heart-filled eyes. Eyes we all  have, but forget in our daily malaise. Notice the minute particulars, the  spontaneous nature of life. Speaking of Beats, if you look real close you  can see Gregory Corso in a couple of audience shots.
Jazz on a Summers  day is about time and place. It freezes a moment in time and makes it  eternal. A time when jazz was common music of american culture. A summers  day when people living in the cold war and the Eisenhower era kick off  their shoes and truly live. It is filled with moments of deep sighs, AH.  Like, the shot of the young girl singing along with Satchmo, if that's not  art I don't know what is. The performers too, Mahalia Jackson is a great  bodhisattva/angel. The cinematography is vibrant. You've never seen the  fifties this real.
I actually love the parts that digress from the  festival. Even though I regret not seeing all of Monk. But it's still  magnanimous, and contrary to another comment, the stage announcer that says  Monk is ""unconcerned"" should be understood as Monk is on a  different level. He makes music for different reasons. If you don't what  that means, just listen. Monk will whisper to you in a dream.
This was a  time when the music was more than just refined listening for museums and  chamber halls, it oozed into everything. Seeing the boating footage with  the Jazz, it's just poetic. Jazz is part of life. It is the expression of  life. The people are having a good time on a summers day. A day that seems  so far away. This will never happen again. Not like this. This is what  great films and art are made of.
There is beauty in every waking moment  my friends. Just look. Breathe. Feel. Thank you Bert Stern.",953078400,144,2261,4.4092009685230025
346205,4,6301658795,"This is without a doubt a video any serious jazz enthusiast must have. Not because it is such a great movie, as the liner notes pompously want to imply. On the contrary, what's so great about this movie is that one can see and hear many jazzmen in action. It's actually a shame we don't get more, since for long endless sequences we are kept starving for the protagonists, namely those who make the music and are the main reason for this video.
Here is the reconstructed list (missing from jacket and film) of the performers, in order of appearance:
1. The Jimmy Giuffre (ts) - Bob Brookmeyer (vtb) - Jim Hall (g) trio
2. Thelonious Monk (p), Henry Grimes (b), Roy Haynes (d)
3. The Sonny Still (ts) - Sal Salvador (g) group
4. Anita O' Day
5. The George Shearing Quintet
6. Dinah Washington, with probably Terry Gibbs (vibes), Urbie Green (tb), Max Roach (d)
7. The Art Farmer - Gerry Mulligan Quartet
8. Big Maybelle, with an ad-hoc orchestra
9. Chuck Berry
10. The Chico Hamilton Quartet, with Eric Dolphy (fl)
11. The Louis Armstrong All Stars, with Trummy Young(tb), Barney Bigard (cl), probably Arvell Shaw (b), Danny Barcelona (d), joined by Jack Teagarden on Rockin' Chair
12. Mahalia Jackson
All perform at the top of their form. This is not to say, however, that the video is not marred by some deficiencies. Most annoying is the talking on top of a performance, the excessive and lengthy shots of a not-too-competent public, lengthy extraneous scenes with unexciting landscapes, and a general attitude of putting jazz music in the background.  There are some nonchalant omissions: such as the unmentioned band with a singer, not shown, between appearances 1. and 2., rehearsing ""Do Nothing Till You Hear from Me"" with an Ellington-sounding reed section. Also between 1. and 2., and between 4. and 5., we have to swallow the looks and music of a Dixieland band (Ely's Chosen Six ?) the members of which do not seem to know that jazz playing is about generating swing; and some other boring pseudo-classical and classical stuff between 2. and 3. (with flute, cello, guitar) and 4. and 5 (classical cello playing Bach).
In my subjective opinion, the best performances are those by:
Thelonious Monk, playing his masterpiece Blue Monk, unfortunately marred by some inconsequential and unnecessary talking (about the weather!) over his great solo. Notice the strange (for today) comment about his being ""unconcerned"", as well as the failure to recognize Monk's deep sense of the blues and respect for the tradition.
The Sonny Stitt's group playing Blues Walk, unfortunately cut at the beginning and again dented by a superimposed voice presentation.  Notice the marvelous solo by Sal Salvador on guitar, while the camera moves to boats instead of focusing on his wonderful hands - funny also that we mostly see his left hand only, as if he were playing single-handed; same for Stitt. It seems the cameramen had not yet learned about zooms, movements etc. Enhanced by (short) shots of a beautiful black lady in blue.
Big Maybelle, who is as lovely as her voice is hoarse. Beautifully accompanied by Buck Clayton - great solo on his trumpet - and Jo Jones (d), both ex-Basie alumni well immersed in the spirit of the traditional blues.  Too bad we do not hear more of that broad-toned saxophonist seen at the far right before the performance and heard in the riffs. Slightly marred by lengthy shots of a not-too-good-looking red-clad lady who does not seem to know how to dance.
Chuck Berry playing his Sweet Little Sixteen, who modestly demonstrates what king Elvis has never learned, with shots a man who does really know how to dance (cut above the head! maybe because he was dark-skinned?). Only slightly marred by a solo on the clarinet, probably by Peanuts Hucko, who tries hard to get in the heat of the mood without quite succeeding (perhaps the saxophonist mentioned above would have done better). All the same, a great performance.
Louis Armstrong's All Stars.  Satchmo, in spite of the sorry state of his lips, well visible, shows his mastery of the trumpet: the note he slides and recaptures twice in Lazy River, and always the powerful presence of his no-nonsense and sensual tone, for which he is justly famous. Barney Bigard is heard little in Tiger Rag, Trummy Young practically not at all, Danny Barcelona does not get too much in the way - even the abused and fearsome When the Saints, heard last, gets through without problems - and Jack Teagarden is seen and heard singing Rockin' Chair with Louis. Of whom we admire also the initial jokes about his European acquaintances, with his colorful way of talking, which shines in its originality, opposed to the boring formality of the show master (Willis Conover?).
Mahalia Jackson, with the deep, moving intensity of a great jazz singer (even though she sings the gospel: about Our Heaven, Our Lord, etc.) and the tender freshness of a little girl - she was 47 at that time. A simple accompaniment of piano and bass lets her presence and soul dominate the place.
Of course one can't forget the dazzling, professional and exciting show by the great Anita O' Day, an example of exceptional vocal technique.  The interventions by Art Farmer in the Gerry Mulligan group, the latter quite disappointing, and by Eric Doplhy in an otherwise boring and pretentious performance by the Chico Hamilton Quintet. Dinah Washington's interplay with the vibraphonist, probably Terry Gibbs, in All of Me is also a good moment - with a great trombone player, probably Urbie Green. While most of what was praised at the time, such as the music by Hamilton, Shearing (some Latin stuff, put to shame by any old Cuban or modern Salsa band), Mulligan and Giuffre, has terribly dated with time and lost universality - not so for Monk and the others singled out above.
To conclude, this is a video worth seeing. And studying. Many times. Even at the cost of closing one's eyes occasionally and glossing over some irritating poor choices of images and other esthetic misjudgments. But we can be happy the filmmakers allow us to see those great jazzmen in action, most of them dead by now, over forty years after the edition of the Newport Jazz Festival, in color and with excellent sound.",947548800,58,6231,4.819626168224299

The performances are all wonderful, especially Louis Armstrong with JackTeagarden, Anita O'Day, and a stunning finale by Mahalia Jackson.
The Chuck Berry segment is glaringly inappropriate for a jazz fest (the jazz sideman look bemused), but it reminds us that rock and roll was getting ready to dominate popular music.

346255,5,6301658795,"This treasure was filmed at the Newport Jazz Festival in Rhode Island in 1958. The festival was held at the same time as the America's Cup yacht races, so there are some scenes of that as well. It is such a delight to watch.

This film mesmerizes me. Partly because of the amazing legendary Jazz artists who perform on stage, and partly because it's the ultimate people-watching experience. It's like stepping out of a time machine into 1958. (Why is everyone beautiful in 1958? It must be the red lipstick. I love red lipstick and think we ladies should wear it more often.) I love the editing- the cameras flit between the performers and the crowd, giving us the sense of revelry that must have been in the air. We see people laughing, dancing, and singing along. There are also shots of people milling about the town, seemingly unconnected to the festival, but contributing to the feel of the documentary. I also love that there is no narration. It's just a free-flowing look at the event, making you feel like you are there.

Some of the highlights for me are: watching the legendary Thelonious Monk play piano; Anita O'Day in a huge hat, black dress and white gloves positively owning Tea For Two to the delight of her audience; the scene where Fred Katz of the Chico Hamilton Quintet is practicing on the cello in his bedroom with no shirt on, cigarette smoke filling the screen as he plays the prelude from Bach's Cello Suite #1; and Dinah Washington singing All Of Me with her ripe, luscious voice. I can't get enough of her and wish she had performed longer.

One of my favorite moments in the film is when Louis Armstrong performs. Ahh, who doesn't love Louis? He was celebrating his 58th birthday at the time of this festival. As he sings and plays, the camera falls on a young girl in the audience and keeps cutting back to her. She is sitting with her friends and thoroughly enjoying herself. In a few places she just seems overwhelmed that she's actually in the presence of Armstrong. It's so charming to watch her. When Armstrong finishes, everyone erupts into applause, boys are slapping each other on the back, and men are kissing their women with a sense of triumph.

Then Armstrong announces that the legend of gospel, Mahalia Jackson, is the last act of the night. She comes out with her lovely white dress and powerful voice and is the only one who could cap off such a magical evening. The concert ends after midnight with Mahalia sweetly singing the Lord's Prayer.

Here's the lineup of Jazz artists who perform:

Jimmy Giuffre 3: Jimmy Giuffre, Bob Brookmeyer, Jim Hall
Thelonious Monk Trio: Thelonious Monk, Henry Grimes, Roy Haynes
Sonny Stitt and Sal Salvador

Dinah Washington

The film adds to the sound with candid pictures of the crowd, the performers at work and at play, the summer day in Newport, the America's Cup boat race, and many creative photographic images which help to blend the music and film into a impressionist's work of art and sound.  Martin Luther King and John F. Kennedy are still alive, Eisenhower is president, the Beatles are in England.

346336,5,6301658795,"Still photographer Bert Stern is perhaps best known for Smirnoff ads, Marilyn Monroe nude shots and the iconic poster from Stanley Kubrick's 1962 film, ""Lolita.""  This his one and only movie, co-directed by Aram Avakian, has landed a place in the National Film Registery.  In 1958, the Newport Jazz Festival was still in its infancy and coincided with the trials for The Americas Cup sailing race.

Stern had thought about making a traditional film but gave up early on for lack of a story.  Instead he turned to a documentary featuring the musicians, but perhaps more importantly, the audience.  He presents full length songs performed by the best known musicians at the time all in Dolby Digital 5.1.  Mostly jazz but interestingly enough, two non-jazz greats make perhaps the biggest impact.  More on than in a minute.

What makes this film more than a straight music concert or a traditional documentary with bits and pieces of music is how Stern and his editor weave back and forth between the performers and the audience.  The audience is always in synch with the right song, even flubbing the lyrics as we are all prone to do.  The audience is mostly wealthy white people but there is a large contingent of black folk sprinkled throughout the flock.  All seems good with the world.  While it's pre-Civil Rights 1958, its Rhode Island not Alabama.

The music is excellent but it was a bit shocking to see a youngish Chuck Berry duckwalking across the stage singing ""Sweet Little 16"" in front of a traditional jazz band, all of whom were smiling with surprise.  Even though a couple audience members seemed befuddled, most were having a great time, especially the younger members in the crowd.  Rock `n roll was here to stay.

The other surprise was the great gospel singer Mahalia Jackson, who like Berry was a little out of place, but brought the house down with a trio of songs to end the show.  This little movie is a gem.

Here is a list of performers:

Jimmy Giuffre 3: Jimmy Giuffre, Bob Brookmeyer, Jim Hall
Thelonious Monk Trio: Thelonious Monk, Henry Grimes, Roy Haynes
Sonny Stitt and Sal Salvador

346342,4,6301658795,"The Newport Jazz Festival has had a somewhat spotty history since its establishment in 1954.  Many residents of the upscale city disliked the traffic, the noise, and the racially mixed crowds.  Even so, in the 1950s and early 1960s, the festival thrived with performaners ranging from Billie Holiday to Judy Garland.  As time passed, however, the tone of acts would change to such a point that even Led Zeppelin played the Newport Jazz Festival--and very nearly caused a riot in the process.  For a time the festival was actually split between Newport and New York City; these days, however, the festival is held at Fort Adams State Park.  But whatever the festival's ups and downs, in 1958 a novice filmmaker captured the event, and the result was memorable indeed.

By his own account, director Bert Stern was really more of a still photographer than a motion picture director, and he had still less experience with documentary.  He originally attempted to create a storyline for the film, but when that notion failed he simply let his cameras focus on whatever pleased him.  The result is as kalediscopic as the music itself, with scenes of Newport, qualifying races for the Americas Cup, crowd scenes, and of course the musicians themselves.  Probably the most iconic image to emerge from the film is that of Anita O'Day, ""the Jezebel of Jazz,"" who on the spur of the moment embellished a black coctail dress and black hat with white feathers--and then proceeded to knock it out of the park with performances of ""Sweet Georgia Brown"" and ""Tea for Two.""  But there's much more than this: Jimmy Giuffre, Thelonious Monk, Dinah Washington, Big Maybelle, Chuck Berry, and Jack Teagarden all take memorable turns as well.

Most of the acts get one, perhaps two numbers--but then we have Louis Armstrong, memorable with several songs and particularly so with ""Old Rockin' Chair"" in his classic duet with Jack Teagarden.  And the show closes with the legendary Mahalia Jackson, whose great voice rings like through a bell ending with ""The Lord's Prayer.""  There's certainly nothing to fault in any of the performances, and the semi-surrealistic quality of the cinematography lends an on-going interest as well.

At the time, JAZZ ON A SUMMER'S DAY was controversial for showing blacks and whites sitting together in the same audience and playing together on the same stage.  Today it is a little controversial for the fact that several of the scenes--the apartment sequences and the famous ""dancing on the roof"" sequence--were actually staged by director Stern after the fact, and some question whether or not this disqualifies the film from any claim of being a documentary.  In my opinion it doesn't much matter.  It's a great film about music and visual impressions of music, and that's what really matters.  The DVD includes a ""making of"" documentary about Stern and the film.  Strongly recommended.

346343,5,6301658795,"This is not a music video, nor is it exactly a documentary of the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival. Instead, it is a mixture of Americana, people watching, music and Newport itself. In fact, a lot of the scenery - aside from the town of Newport - is of regattas. I felt as though I were wisked back to 1958 (I was 9 at the time of the festival). So, the good news is you go on a trip down memory lane. The bad news is the camera isn't always on the performers.

Headliners: Jimmy Giuffre, Thelonious Monk, Henry Grimes, Sonny Stitt, Sal Salvador, Anita O'Day, George Shearing, Dinah Washington, Gerry Mulligan, Big Maybelle Chuck Berry, Chico Hamilton, Louis Armstrong, Jack Teagarden, Mahalia Jackson.

Supporting musicians: David Baily, Bob Brookmeyer, Buck Clayton, Bill Crow, Eric Dolphy, Eli's Chosen Six (short segment), Art Farmer, Harold Gaylon, Nathan Gershman, Terry Gibbs, Urbie Green, Jim Hall, Peanuts Hucko, Jo Jones, Ray Mosca, Armando Peraza, Max Roach, Rudy Rutherford.

The performances:
Train And The River (The Jimmy Guiffre Trio)

Blue Monk (Thelonious Monk)

Loose Walk (Sonny Stitt)

Sweet Georgia Brown & Tea For Two (Anita O'Day) Sweet Georgia Brown was in a strange tempo, but when Tea for Two got underway a real highlight - aside from Anita's great singing and good looks - was when she traded phrases with the drummer. I don't recall any shots of the drummer, unfortunately, so that would have been a disappointment except the camera cut to some cuties in the audience. Of course, those cuties are now in their 70s and 80s or dead.

All Of Me (Dinah Washington) This was the highlight for me. Dinah, at one point, picked up a pair of mallets and did a duet with the vibe player (with a smiling Max Roach looking on). Max was in great form and Dinah did a remarkable job on the vibes! Oh, and this rendition is probably her finest. If you've ever listened to a Dinah Washington compilation album with All of Me on it, this may be the cut you heard.

Catch As Catch Can (Gerry Mulligan) Great 50s style jazz.

I Ain't Mad At You (Big Maybelle) Blues epitomized!

Sweet Little Sixteen (Chuck Berry)Until I watched this video this was my favorite clip. I discovered it on YouTube and it's the first post in Post Your Favorite YouTube Videos thread. Jo Jones on drums. Chuck doing his skip-walk across the stage while Jack Teagarten is looking on not knowing what to think, and the unidentified clarinet player getting into it.

Blue Sands (Chico Hamilton Quintet) On the fence about this one. Chico is a great and innovative drummer who did some amazing mallet work (now I know why he used concert toms). The piece, though, was a cross between Carribean and New Age. It definitely grew on me.

Up A Lazy River, Tiger Rag, Rockin' Chair, When The Saints (Louis Armstrong) The drummer, Danny Bercelona, was a chops monster with great taste. The duet with Jack Teagarten and Louis was great.

Walk Over God's Heaven / Didn't It Rain, The Lord's Prayer (Mahalia Jackson) What can I say? - there never was nor will there ever be again a Mahalia. What a grand finale.

I watch this at least once every other month because it brings me pleasure from both the music and the nostalgic reminder of my youth (I was nine years old at the time so the overall scenes from that era are still vivid in my memory.) But the music itself is simply great and have withstood the test of time very nicely. This is film that music and history lovers alike will enjoy.",1335225600,4,3463,4.618892508143323
346344,5,6301658795,"~ Bert Stern only made one movie in his career, and it is visually stunning.  From the start it is clear that Bert Stern is a visual artist with a great understanding of perspective, angle, selective focus, and image composition.  That is what made him such a successful photographer.  He set out to produce a document of a special weekend in Newport, and he succeeded.  He did a great job of incorporating scenes from the America's Cup trials of that weekend along with scenes of the local people going about their wealthy lives plus the unique event of the jazz festival.  He was able to subtly show the co-existence of the ultra-rich at leisure and the musicians at work.  Through images of the crowd he was able to show the fact that at an event such as a jazz festival people of all races and ages could enjoy each others company - in the 1950's in America that was not always the case.
~ The bonus features include an extensive interview with Bert Stern that is enlightening.  Not only does he outline his concepts in putting together the documentary but he gives credit where credit is due when he talks about the contribution of the Avakian brothers.  That interview also clearly indicates his intent to make this something other than just a concert film.  In addition to the interview on the DVD, the liner notes accompanying the DVD provide futher insight.
~ Others have written about the fact that this is not a ""concert film"" in the broadest sense of that phrase, and Stern makes it clear that he did not intend it to be strictly a ""concert film"".  For that reason, people looking for a film that documents all or most of the performances from that weekend are rightfully disappointed.  However, the film does give us some wonderful moments and the opportunity to watch performances by artists who we would not otherwise be able to see.  Where else can you see video of Jimmy Giuffre with Bob Brookmeyer or Chico Hamilton's band practicing or Chuck Berry improvising with a clarinetist or the absolutely stunning sight of Mahalia Jackson casting a calming spell over an audience by singing ""The Lord's Prayer"". By editing together the images of Miss Jackson and her captivated crowd, Stern is able to demonstrate the power of music.  Of course, this is the movie in which Anita O'Day delivers her marvelous performance that rocketed her to international stardom and brought her to the attention of a broad audience.
~ The insert liner notes and the interview also indicate that there are tens of thousands of feet of film archived somewhere waiting to be explored.  Hopefully someday someone will take up the challenge and go through all that film and give us a more complete view of the music from that weekend.  But for now we should be thankful that we have this beautifully captured and excellently edited document of a time when people went to a concert unencumbered by electronic devices, e-mail, text messages, etc and all they did was enjoy the music.",1330214400,5,2971,4.71953578336557
346345,5,6301658795,"Not only is this every bit as incredible a music festival documentary as Monterey Pop, in capturing music and culture; but it's the culture it captures which is amazing. So much is celebrated about what came just before, several years before, and not too long after, but not as much is celebrated about this time ('58) where jazz and rock n roll were hot, outward sexual freedom from women was ok, and races (in some places) were starting to interact as a very normal and comfortable thing. It captures it all on and off stage so well. And what we see onstage is incredible; from Dinah Washington, Anita O' Day, and Mahalia Jackson, to Chico Hamilton and George Shearing. Every single performer were shinning, ingluding the great Thelonious Monk, etc. Nothing about this documentary doesn't work.

346346,5,6301658795,"This wonderful full length film lovingly documents both the music and the scene at an early Newport Jazz Festival. The list of jazz stars captured here whets the appetite of any jazz fan, and the film almost always captures the essence of their performances. Their names are in the description, so there's no need to repeat them here I first saw this film in a theater as a teenager. I loved it then and I still love it today.

My only complaint with the film is that while filming some of the greatest jazz musicians onstage, director Bert Stern (too) often cuts away to visuals of the scene around the music. He was obviously aiming for a non-jazz audience, but what he failed to understand that the music IS strong enough to hold the interest of the audience! Given the musicians involved, all of them at the top of their game, how could it not be? One of the most unforgettable moments is the incredibly glorious sound of Mahalia Jackson singing Ellington's ""Come Sunday;"" another is of Anita O'Day in an audaciously large hat. There are many others. This is a film for the ages.",1324339200,,1083,4.553846153846154
346347,5,6301658795,"Extraordinary documentary captures the magic of the 1958 Newport Jazz festival, featuring performances by such jazz, R&B and gospel luminaries as Louis Armstrong, Mahalia Jackson, Chuck Berry, Anita O'Day and Dinah Washington.  There are too many highlights to name.  Indeed (if such a thing made any sense), the entire film is a series of highlights.  A few of the standout performances include Armstrong's extended Dixieland set, O'Day's playful interaction with her musicians, The Chico Hamilton Quintet's haunting ""Blue Sand"", Jackson's powerful musical version of the Lord's Prayer, and best of all (in my opinion at least), Dinah Washington's scorching  rendition of ""All of Me"".  That one performance alone is worth the price of admission.

One of the best things about this film is that it doesn't stick with the performers alone, but constantly turns its attention to the fans.  The audience is as diverse as it could be:  black and white, ages ranging from infants to middle-aged, teenagers in tee shirts and blue jeans and older folks in suits and pearls, all swept up in the magic of the jazz.  It is a reminder that once upon a time, at least, music had the power to unite people.

My only complaint with this film is that it is WAY too short.  It should have been twice as long as it is.  I didn't want it to end!

 This dvd  is a snapshot of a day in time with the Newport Jazz Festival as a background to an era that is now gone. The audio is amazing given the conditions under  which it was produced. For those of you into jazz, I think you will agree that the late 50's produced the warmest sounding jazz recordings...this is no exception. There are some outstanding performances by Anita O'Day, Louis Armstrong, Chico Hamilton, Jimmy Guifre, Mahalia Jackson and others. There are no full sets from any of the artisits mentioned but I will take well recorded video and audio any day...as long as I know what to expect before making a purchase.

The film presents itself in  vibrant color  and I found the shots of the people and places as entertatining as the music.

To my surprise the dvd contained may extra features like biographies of the film's artists and Bert Stern's insight into the making of the film, as well as a soundtrack CD!

If you are looking for complete musical performances from as many artists as possible, don't buy it. If you find merit from the viewpoint of  ""What did they have to say?"" ...buy it! You will not be disappointed. You may end up watching it repeatedly...each time  sharing  this piece of  musical history with more people

Of course, there's the music, and the performers -- and yes, Anita O'Day is remarkable...dinah is too underrated today and we need more of her in jazz recordings.  The concert flies by all too soon. Late fifties' dress, hair styles...most acutely, this is an integrated audience!  In 1958 America, there were centers of integration (NY,NO, LA) but most of it was ghetto: Jewish, Italian, WASP, Black.  In the midwest(where I'm from) it was clear: 'Grosse Pointe' may have been named for its locale, but you had to fill out a questionnaire to buy, and if you didn't score the points you didn't get it--'ethnics' lost points for background, blacks lost all points from the start.  So the film is more remarkable in that it shows a segment of American society far more open and sophisticated than the rest, more likely than not united by a singular love of the music.  That said, because it is an amateur's film, there are sections poorly lit, or cut abruptly...but I bought a copy for myself and one for each of my jazz-loving godchildren, and I'd do it again in a snap.",1256860800,,1195,4.591549295774648

It's something of a sour old Gen-Xer's solace to think that it's unlikely the real event could have borne much resemblance to this utterly gorgeous film made by the great photographer Bert Stern, all cherry-red and sea-blue and glowing with an unreal light. Stern (most famous for the ""last session"" with Marilyn Monroe) makes everyone an icon, the audience as well as the performers.  These seem the very hip/squarest cats in the world at the right place at exactly the right time -- black guys in crisp suits and white guys in t-shirts and pompadours, girls in hats and scarves and boy's slacks, women in crinolines and multi-strand pearls and blue-tinted sunglasses, men in horn-rims and skinny ties --  all of them sitting together and bopping and smiling and smoking and occasionally getting up to jitterbug ecstatically in the angelic light of Bert Stern's awesome camera. You know it's a good show when Thelonious Monk is one of the opening acts, folks. Anita O'Day gets the party started, Chico Hamilton makes it mellow, Dinah Washington burns it up, Chuck Berry gets the kids rockin' and rollin', Louis Armstrong sends everyone into conniptions of rapture, and Mahalia Jackson absolutely steals the entire show at the end with The Lord's Prayer, a beautiful moment which truly seems to herald the breaking of a new kind of dawn.

346358,5,6301658795,"First of all, let me tell you how thrilled I am by this DVD - it has amazing musical moment with, for instance, Thelonious Monk, Anita O'Day, Mahalia Jackson and Louis Armstrong shining very brightly (although, yes, the Monk number is marred by some mood shots and other interventions...), Satchmo and Teagarden crooning and scatting magnificently... Actually, I don't think I've seen a more beautiful footage of Armstrong's performance; he was still on the top in the 50s and Bert Stern portraits him beautifully, with some fortunatelly stylized stage lighting.

And it goes beyond music; check out the glamour of O'Day's attire, the moment very spirited Dinah Washington grabs the battons and joins Terry Gibbs on the vibes, the look on great Jo Jones' face while he supports Chuck Berry or, for that matter, the bizarre clarinet spot on that number - someone's review said it's Peanuts Hacko (who is too caucasian, as you can see on Armstrong's numbers on some other DVD's), others mention Rudy Rutheford - I don't know how he looked like (I do know he played in Count Basie orchestra back in 40s or something like that, so I guess he might be African American)...

I would agree with those who say that cool jazz numbers don't fare here as well as the traditional jazz, blues, gospel, mainstream and some modern ( Thelonious Monk!) numbers, even with the annoying break in the middle of the Sonny Stitt-Sal Salvador performance.

The breaks in the performance grow rarer as the film reaches the end, so there is place for true climax and musical as well as cinemathic catharsis in the end. But, from strictly cinematic point of view, I must add that there are some really fine shots; even the disinterested lady eating ice-cream looks interesting - it probably is a picture of the festival culture before the 50s, as is the attempt to connect it with the entertainment and leisure industry in general....

All in all, this is a unique jazz experience (and an interesting although not perfect film), recommended (or, should I say indispensable) to all serious jazz fans and interested beginners.",1211328000,,2098,4.884831460674158

It really is like being there and the mood of the music is complemented by the scenes of the audience and street scenes.

The colors are very good, and without any plot or voiceover to get in the way (though Stern says in an additional commentary on the disc they tried to put a story in but gave up) it is just the music and the audience.

That being said, no, he is not a filmmaker by trade; if you are looking for a masterful film, look elsewhere; if you are looking for footage of the jazz musicians, by themsleves, isolated from the experience of playing to an audience, look elsewhere.  However, if you want a great looking document portraying the experience of great jazz musicians playing to a crowd in 1958, and what it really looked and felt like, this is the film you must own.  In my opinion, the opening scenes of Jimmy Guiffre playing (a vastly underrated jazz legend) are enough to get someone hooked.  Lastly, this is one of the times when the DVD-format really shows its advantages in terms of sound.

Continuing along this vein, during the festival itself, Stein spends much of his camera time observing the audience caught unaware reacting to jazz on a summer day; after all, live music does not exist in a vacuum. It's this footage along with the incredible jazz music that makes this documentary really special. As a viewer we get to react to the music, and react to the audience reacting to the music. That girl with the seductively cute smile in the yellow dress, and that gruff man hiding behind the shades with the nervous twitch are people that we can connect to from our own personal experiences at open air summer concerts. The feeling of community one gets as the music breaks down the barriers and the sun begins to set. Stein allows his moving compositions to develop and flesh out the character of his subjects, giving us a nostalgic feeling for a time gone by that may have occurred long before we were even born. It does not matter because we are there! But this particular slice of time has special significance, because jazz would soon be replaced in popularity by Rock & Roll. We watch it happen before our eyes as a young Chuck Berry takes the stage. Backed by some excellent jazz musicians, all looking ""amused"" but not taking very seriously the music that would knock them off the charts for good within a couple of years. As Berry's classic Rock & Roll riffs project across the audience, young people spontaneously jump to their feet and start moving to the rhythm while their parents watch, perplexed.",1106784000,7,1859,4.6534954407294835
346367,5,6301658795,"It is so nice to have a movie about, JAZZ! And with just preformances of some of the greatest jazz musicians in the world, how could you not resist?

The video starts off with Monk playing his classic Blue Monk. Chico Hamilton then comes out and is playing a piece from his Spectacular album, in 1955.

That is just the beginning. Later on in the video, the night get's hotter. Even though Chuck Berry preforms on this video, I have to admit he had a lot to do with bringing the audience alive. Gerry Mulligan preforms some. Louis Armstrong comes out, and livens up the place.

As happy I am as there being a movie about jazz, it is upseting, this is practically the only one. Mo' Better Blues was the second jazz movie in 40 years.",1105315200,2,732,4.328467153284672
346368,5,6301658795,"Bert Stern has both an eye and an ear for jazz, par excellence, capturing the spirit of the Newport Jazz festival in its heyday.  This is a wonderful showcase of performances, ranging from the detached Thelonius Monk to the super cool Anita O'Day.  But, without doubt, the performance that stands out is that of Mahalia Jackson who brings the crowd to their feet with ""40 Days"" and then brings them to their knees with her closing psalm, so passionately felt.
The movie takes you through a figurative day, capturing the sea air of Newport, the quiet practice sessions, the ebb and flow of the crowd as it grows to its evening peak, with a rocking performance by Chuck Berry.  The Satchmo takes a wonderful turn at the mike with Jack Teargarden joining him in a fun duet.  Chico Hamilton is there in all his seriousness with Eric Dolphy highlighting the band's performance. George Shearer looks like he could be playing at the Hollywood Bowl.
I was hoping for more extras on the DVD.  The movie leaves you craving for more music. The 50's were the peak of the hip jazz scene and this movie is as hip as they come.",1069027200,17,1112,4.54
346369,5,6301658795,"While I've not seen other Jazz movies or documentaries, I've seen Jazz on a Summer's Day on both VHS and on DVD and enjoy it so much that I've watched it several times and just had to purchase it on DVD.
I have always loved the classic Jazz of the 1950's and 1960's and this film documents one of the best Jazz festivals around, and I think this was the first Jazz festival in what we now know as the Newport Jazz festival.
What I love about this film is how Bert Stern uses his movie camera to shoot the film, much like a still camera and framed the shots just the same. I find it works on motion film as on still photography, especially in this kind of documentary where your documenting a concert. I love the B-roll shots of kids playing, grown ups sunbathing, the dixieland jazz band, the couples driving their vintage autos, and of course the Yaught(sp?) club races and overall, I find that Bert Stern does an incredible job of showing the general atmosphere of the concert and the weather of late summer in Rhode Island.
I find this an incredible film that is worthy of multiple viewings. Not just for it's incredible of shooting techniques, but for the music that is represented here. Lots of great names such as Anita O'Day, Thelonious Munk, George Shearing, Dina Washington etc. I love Bert's use of the reflections of the boats on the water for the opening sequence, mated to Jimmy Giuffrie's live rendition of the Train and the River. All in all, I rate this film a definate 5.",1062979200,4,1488,4.454212454212454
346370,4,6301658795,"Bert Stern was a still photographer who got the opportunity to take a film crew to the 1959 Newport Jazz festival. With limited time and film, Stern and his crew set out not just to record a musical event, but to record a social experience.
For the most part, he succeeds, although there is more than enough footage of a boat race on Chesapeake bay that day to last me for the rest of my life.
The film cuts from performances to reactions of the crowd, as any concert film would. It's interesting to see the wide difference in clothing styles that appealed to people in 1959. Everything from men in suits to greasers in denim can be seen dancing and grooving along with the music.
People living nearby the festival can be seen partying on their roofs and dancing, booze in hand, to the music. People of every age are shown bopping along with whoever is on stage at the time.
Highlights: Anita O'Day's spot-on performance, in spite of the fact that she's well into her much-ballyhooed drug and booze habit (in a recent radio interview she said she couldn't remember doing this gig after even watching the film); Louis Armstrong, Jerry Mulligan, and the rather out-of-place, clearly there-for-the-kids but dressed to the nines and behaving himself, Chuck Berry. Older jazz guys have no idea what to make of Chuck, and one guy, in an attempt to ""jazz up"" Berry's ""Sweet Little Sixteen,"" starts playing some rather odd clarinet runs. Think ""Sweet Little Bar Mitzvah.""
There's a nice bunch of extras on here, too, including an interview with Stern that expalins a lot about what was going on.

This brings us back to a much more simple and appealing era. The color of this movie is vivid for its time and the music of jazz is very intoxication. I loved the way the cameras showcased the legendary artists of this era. Some were great for only that time but others, like Mahalia Jackson reveal why her appeal was  and still is breathtaking, never to be forgotton nor possible to immitate. Mahalia sang her heart out and with such humility,  looks at the waves of applause from jazz enthusiasts ,who were captivated by her dynamic performance and very humbly declares with a motherly wit ""You make me feel like I'm a Star"" Mahalia was more than a Star and she did not even know it.

The ups are the great artists and combinations of artists that you see-Dinah Washington, Mahalia Jackson, Big Maybelle, Louis Armstrong, Jo Jones, Rudy Rutherford, and Chuck Berry. Rock? Jazz? No, mom, it doesn't sound like the record! Chuck Berry's Sweet Little Sixteen is a milestone in whatever genre. With Count Basie's oh-so-smooth drummer Jo Jones setting the beat and Rudy Rutherford's WILD! clarinet solo this song captures the freedom and joy of rock/jazz.

346377,5,6301658795,"Perhaps it's wise, first of all, to acknowledge all of the problems with the film: It frequently finds sailboats and pretty women more photogenic than jazz musicians; it deems it necessary to cut away from the ""real"" musicians to shots of classical string players rehearsing and generic, hokey ""Dixieland"" musicians marching; it truncates all of the musicians' sets and completely omits some of the best performers on the program (Duke Ellington, Miles Davis); it gives too much footage to musicians whose association with jazz is tenuous at best (Big Maybelle, Chuck Berry, Mahalia Jackson).
Having said all that, the purchaser of this DVD still owns perhaps the best example of photographed jazz until films like Clint Eastwood's ""Bird"" and Bertrand Tavernier's ""Round Midnight"" appeared more than 30 years after this documentation of an idyllic, if unexceptional, moment in the music's history. Come to think of it, there's more pure jazz--in terms of quantity as well as variety--in this film than in the two aforementioned examples.
Filmmaker Bert Stern knew the body of Marilyn Monroe (his other noteworthy subject), but he knew nothing about jazz. Not only does the film seem all the more remarkable for his ignorance, but as an ""outsider"" to the music, he was in a better position to train his cameras and microphones on the images likely to appeal to the broadest audience even today (""Bird"" and ""Round Midnight"" not only kept viewers away but were received poorly by viewers not already ""in the know"" about Charlie Parker, Bud Powell, Lester Young and Dexter Gordon).
With the exception of this film, catching a jazz musician in movies or on TV has always been the rarest of experiences--like sighting an endangered species, then discovering it was all a false alarm.  Stern, by contrast, serves up a colorful, sumptuous feast of music. We see jazz musicians not as they're usually portrayed in film--black and white cameos shot in shadowy film noir compositions--but richly saturated, ""blushing"" 35mm Kodachrome color than hasn't faded like so much of the inferior film stock of the 1970s. And this is no Woodstock audience--there are empty seats, there are old faces, black faces, infants' faces. There's a leisurely quality that allows time to stop on essentially static visual compositions while the music swirls around the mechnical operations of the camera, constantly arguing its prior claim to our attention.
For a change, the music is no mere accompaniment to the images; Stern manages to achieve the opposite effect, making the images do the job normally assigned the film score. It's the candid and ordinary, yet striking, images of all these fascinating faces, this crowd of music-makers, some with instruments and others merely with the capacity to respond, that draw us, as if subconsciously, to the film's primary ""action""--the music itself.
Although ""Jazz on a Summer's Day"" may pale compared to any number of ""actual"" summer days experienced by many fortunate jazz fans, it remains the closest approximation of such an experience on film.",1009411200,5,3065,5.167002012072435
346378,5,6301658795,"I've loved this film since I first saw it in its theatrical release oh so many years ago...with the eye of an artist, Bert Stern crafted a visual masterpiece around some musical treasures, starting with the vastly underrated Jimmy Giuffre, with his trio-mates Bob Brookmeyer and Jim Hall playing ""Train and the River"".
It has many views of Newport, its people, the audience, a regatta...it captures that era of the 50's when we liked Ike and nobody knew smoking was a bad habit.
Among my favorites are Anita O'Day, Gerry Mulligan, the great ""Rockin' Chair"" duet between Louis Armstrong and Jack Teagarden, the magnificent Mahalia Jackson, and of course, Jimmy Giuffre...I think it's truly one of the best films centered around music ever made.

I first saw this wonderful film many years ago and I remember how it affected me. A passion for jazz AND photography makes this film the perfect vehicle to soak up the atmosphere of the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival. I would have been 8 years old when it was filmed and even at that early age, I was into Monk, Mulligan and Shearing. George lives just up the road from me and I know him quite well. He would have been 39 in 1958.
The film is beautifully shot, focusing on the performances, the music and atmosphere, but without a documentary. It doesn't need one! The way Bert Stern moves from artiste to audience is superb. Cool performers and guys in the audience, young and old all on the ""afterbeat"". Wonderful to see Monk playing ""Blue Monk"", Anita O'Day singing ""Georgia Brown"". Dig that hat!! And Mr Shearing with quintet, performing a late slot - fantastic!
The icing on the cake is an interactive journey, narrated by Mr Stern, behind the scenes of the film. He tells you his thinking, his emerging appreciation of jazz and his roots in photography. This is interlinked with specific sequences from his unique film. As the liner notes say ""I was just . . . basically a photographer who wanted to make a movie before I was 30 . . . it was a form of a documentary and had a lot to do with photograhy . . . it wasn't something that I had ever seen before and it just intrigued me . . . it's more of of a happening. . . interpretive,  happening . . .""
