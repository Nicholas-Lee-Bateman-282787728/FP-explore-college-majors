2928767,5,B000V3IXBO,"Yes, it's inspiring.  But Trantasia is surprising, cheeky and very, very funny.

Watch the girls hit the strip in Vegas and reduce grown men to excitement, bewilderment and just plain confusion.

It's a window into a very provocative and fascinating world.  If you ever wondered why.....this movie has all the answers.",1196208000,10,318,5.176470588235294
2928768,5,B000V3IXBO,"I really liked the film and its documentary style. The production values were very good. The ladies were, for the most part, amazing to look at. As a transwoman, I was a bit envious of some of them. The personal interviews are what really made the film worthwhile. I personally found the pageant part to be typical and in some cases reinforced the notion that transwomen are overdone Barbi dolls or drag queens, which simply isn't the case. The interviews mostly proved otherwise and provided a sensitive look into the aspirations and dreams of these ladies to live their lives as the women they were born to be. Kudos overall!",1195344000,22,627,4.709090909090909
2928769,5,B000V3IXBO,"I was very surprised and often moved by this gem of a film.  I thought it might be fluffy camp, but it has such a sweet heart to it.  The girls are true beauties, both inside and out.  Funny, touching and an interesting glimpse into a very unique subset of the LGBT community.  What bravery to tell such a personal story!  Their life lessons should be required study.  Brava to the girls and thank you for a great movie!",1194307200,,420,4.253164556962025
2928770,5,B000V3IXBO,We loved this documentary!! Every minute was entertaining and intriguing. It was crazy interesting to hear each unique backstory of the girls and very touching as well. We also found ourselves laughing a lot... there is no shortage of humorous diva-like drama to compliment the touching and interesting sides of the movie. I had very little knowledge of this world and still deeply enjoyed it and would recommend checking it out.,1193270400,6,429,5.056338028169014

2928772,5,B000V3IXBO,"Neither overly reverent nor remotely exploitative, this is a unique and eminently watchable treatment of a group of subjects who have truly gone the extra mile to live their dreams.

2928785,4,B000V3IXBO,"I was amazed at the quality of the production. I feared that it might sensationalize the topic and the people involved.  It did not.  The interviews were incredibly candid and straightforward.  While there were some tasteless displays by a few, even that could be understood and accepted in context.  The women (born men) were compelling in their stories and the family support was not only loving and remarkable, but spoke to the sincerity of most of the focus group.

Having lived most of my life with a strong desire to present as a woman, I do not feel that I am one.  I have chosen a rather conventional lifestyle as a man, but I have done my best to condition myself to present well in female clothing.  I often wear obviously feminine clothing while dressing casually and have been told by men and women that I look good in ""continental"" clothing.  I have narrow hips and slender legs, but have maintained a healthy weight so that my slender waist emphasizes my hips particularly in low-rise jeans and shorts.  While high heeled and wedged sandals often prompt a second look ( sometimes disapproving) my comfort and poise in feminine attire seems to generate little genuine attention or disapproval.

I found this documentary helpful because although I am primarily a cross dresser, the understanding of women and their style (carriage) I have gained through more than forty years makes me feel like a sister.  There are several women in the group that I would love to befriend and share perspectives with.

Regardless of any gender confusion, men who can feel like women at times are better men.  I know that my relationships with the women in my life (spouse, friends, daughters) have been enhanced by my feminine propensities.  Only my wife knows, but she places more value in my taste for the clothing she selects and welcome clothing gifts I chose for her.

I believe that this film would be both entertaining and enlightening for all men and women.",1313798400,5,1961,4.777448071216617
2928786,3,B000V3IXBO,This DVD is a nice in-depth look at a few women and their life challenges. It's a good documentary and worth watching...,1313366400,3,120,4.5

2928788,4,B000V3IXBO,"Fascinating look at a Vegas beauty pageant for transsexuals. . .but probably not in ways some contestants ever imagined. Although contest was ostensibly held to promote transgender acceptance (or so most of the entrants keep insisting), this high-minded ""cause"" somehow gets lost in the shuffle as the garishly made-up gals parade up and down Vegas Strip in porn star/hooker attire, accost tourists with fliers for their contest, unbutton shirts of male vacationers while delivering ribald come-ons and flaunt boob jobs to gaping poolsiders.

Aside from thoughtful looks at backgrounds of several contestants (including photos of pre-op boyhoods) and their families, pretty much unfolds like a real-life sex-change version of Showgirls, complete with plenty of boobs, bare butts and (following announcement of winner) bitchy banter galore.

Nice companion piece to The Queen, a 1968 documentary about a New York transvestite pageant--to which it is nearly identical, give or take some reconstructed genitalia.",1238198400,4,1009,5.675496688741722

2928790,2,B000V3IXBO,"Aside from a couple contestants who seem more down to earth than the rest, this video is chock full of self absorbed people who seem like they are living in an out of touch fantasy world. This video could have been something good and important to the trans community. But instead it's  more of a silicon pumped drag queen train wreck.

The most comical and pathetic stories come from two of the african-american contestants. Both are incredibly narcistic and self centered. Even sadly blaming ""racism"" because they lost the pageant! Come on! You both stunk and that is the ONLY reason and you both know it!

Buy it used and don't pay more than $5!",1231718400,10,647,4.608695652173913
2928791,5,B000V3IXBO,"I watched this last night, and found the entire film/documentary to be very fascinating, fun, enjoyable, exciting, Revealing, and Inspiring!

I was not sure what to expect, because I am accustomed to seeing professional shows at local clubs.  However the film truly represents a diverse range of Transgendered women vying for recognition of their beauty.  Aside from the contest and the documentary style interviews with contenders for the crown, honest discussions about lifestyle choices, gender identity, and family relationships are explored.  For anyone who lives a bit outside the ""norm"" of societal standards, or for those who consider their lifestyle to be ""Alternative"" in some fashion this DVD is a great resource for confirmation, inspiration, and background information about *why* people choose to live outside the bounds of strictly dictated rules and regs about who we are supposed to be.

Personally, I identified with many of the individual women interviewed in the film, and I found myself smiling throughout much of the film.  Some stories also contain obstacles and societal situations which are quite serious, but overall the film is fun, uplifting, and exciting.

One transgendered woman was genuinely upset that others were acting overly naughty, exposing themselves without cause, and generally acting trampy.  Her sincerity flows from the screen.  A few acted like drag queens, but many were quite serious and sincere.  Most of the women are beautiful.  Watching the film, and viewing the actual event (beauty contest) was a fun experience plus the backstage scenarios were entertaining and informative.

I was totally invested in the interviews (not boring documentary style, but well produced and captivating), until the end when one obese tranny that I had previously respected began to claim ""racism"" as the factor in her defeat.  Obviously, obesity was the key factor in her defeat, so the racism issue was invalid.  I felt that she discredited her previous sincerity when she blamed her loss on racial issues, rather than accepting the fact that she she is very overweight.  Despite a few catty remarks at the end, the film is sincere, and well worth watching.  One contender who I assumed would take a top three position only made it into the final round, so there are some surprises in the contest results.

I assume that others (from other Alternative lifestyles) would find this film inspirational, because the contestants are living out their dreams instead of playing out the societal and familial demands which most people are not capable of breaking away from.  Yet I also assume that anyone interested in sociology, psychology, or subcultures would also enjoy this film.  I cannot think of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trantasia/dp/B000V3IXBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trantasia</a>&nbsp;as a ""documentary,"" because it is not boring and the style and film quality are fantastic.  In fact, the stage show is glamorous, and the bodies are beautiful.

If this doesn't grab you, I'll also mention that there are many revealed and mostly revealed breasts, lots of skin, and sexy outfits.  Many of the women are all about beauty, and their bodies reveal their dedication to being women.  A few of the women are obese, but they take the time to explain to those who are hefty how they can modify their body shapes with  corsets, clothing, etc., in order to be more feminine.  Therefore this film has something for nearly everyone; whether gay, straight, bi-, male, female, transsexual, fat or thin...this film truly speaks to nearly everyone.

I believe that this is a perfect film/documentary for people from all walks of life (Alternative or ""vanilla"") to understand and appreciate those who live outside the bounds of supposed ""normality"" and ASSIGNED gender roles.

Inspired by this film, I will soon be reviewing the following books and DVDs, as well, plus other purchases I have made;&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miss-Continental-Pageant/dp/B000RO9PT6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miss Continental Pageant</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/El-Calentito/dp/B000NA278U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">El Calentito</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transamerica-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000ETRCMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transamerica (Widescreen Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Selves-Understanding-Transsexualism-For-Families-Friends-Coworkers-and-Helping-Professionals/dp/0787967025/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Selves: Understanding Transsexualism--For Families, Friends, Coworkers, and Helping Professionals</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Transgender-Companion-Male-to-Female-The-Complete-Guide-to-Becoming-the-Woman-you-Want-to-Be/dp/1434813223/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Transgender Companion (Male to Female): The Complete Guide to Becoming the Woman you Want to Be</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Praeger-Handbook-of-Transsexuality-Changing-Gender-to-Match-Mindset-Sex-Love-and-Psychology/dp/0275991768/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Praeger Handbook of Transsexuality: Changing Gender to Match Mindset (Sex, Love, and Psychology)</a>.",1207440000,12,5413,6.875730994152047

2928793,5,B000V3IXBO,"I was fortunate to see ""Trantasia"" in a packed theatre as part of Los Angeles' long running OUTFEST. When the lights came up at the end of the screening I remember saying: ""This is 'Paris Is Burning' for a new generation!""  Besides the obvious connection between the two documentaries, I believe they both successfully accomplish a similar goal: to educate the viewer about a particular sub-culture with humor, humanity, and intelligence.  Besides laughing along with the participants thru the process of a Beauty Pageant, there are some remarkable backstory segments as some of the girls travel back home to visit with their families...but the moment when one of the beauty queen contestants said some homophobic comments took my breath away in it's utter rawness (and contradiction to the open-mindedness of a Transgendered Beauty Pageant!)  Our audience was abuzz for almost a minute after his/her remark.

This film is outstanding and highly recommended!  And for those of you out there (and you know who you are) who love to quote awesome lines of movie dialogue...get ready to fill your mind with more quotables than ""Mommie Dearest!'",1196726400,25,1140,5.140540540540541

8216381,5,B000V3IXBO,"I absolutely love this film.

Las Vegas promoters planning a review starring Jahna Steele invited transsexuals to participate in ""The World's Most Beautiful Transsexual Pageant,"" a two-day contest from which eight or so women would be offered jobs in the review. About 20 women arrive for all-night rehearsals and the pageant itself: swimsuit, evening gown, and talent competition, the selection of eight finalists and three prize winners. We follow the women backstage and get in-depth profiles of six: two from Chicago and one each from LA, San Francisco, San Antonio, and Columbia, South Carolina. We meet their families, and we learn about their lives and their journeys of self-discovery.

This film now pays homage to the late Jahna Steele .. a true legend and firestarter in the LGBT community.

Definitely a hard one to find, so yeah .. get it HERE while you have the chance.

8216382,5,B000V3IXBO,"I just tripped across this docu last weekend and....oh my gosh.  I missed the All Star Game (a GOOD one!) because I could not tear myself away from this film.  I can see why it was awarded Best Docu whenever it was that it aired on Showtime. Not only did it make the differences clear between transVESTITES (who sometimes appear to aspire more to being caricatures of already heightened females or teenage girls) and transGENDER - who are really nuanced females.  SOme of these girls were SO great I would have LOVED to have one or two of them as real girlfriends.  It was fascinating to see which of them were very self-aware and honest with themselves and the filmmakers, and which were still out of touch with what they were LIVING and what they were SAYING.  I ALSO LEARNED SOME REALLY GREAT MAKEUP TIPS!  As an artist I thought I understood using light and shadow.  But...these girls made such great effort to achieve what we gals with our innate XX chromosomes take for granted.

THEY REALLY ALLOWED THESE FILMMAKERS INTO THEIR PSYCHES.  Even their families allowed themselves and their journeys to be known.  In this case...What Happened in Vegas TOTALLY did NOT stay in Vegas!  For which I consider myself as a viewer fortunate.",1361318400,3,1236,4.702325581395349
8216383,1,B000V3IXBO,"I must say that my review of this tranny train wreck is not meant to be insulting to the individuals who gave this docu-drama postive review. I respect your opinions. That being said I have to ask; were we all watching the same thing? I was very interested in watching this show when I saw it advertised on Logo Television's Doc series as I have always been interested in drag and gender re-assignment stories. As it began I was excited to see the snippets of interviews with the girls that would be competing against each other to win one of the coveted spots in a new tranny review. I'm sorry I could barely get that out without blowing Pepsi out of my nose. Each girl seem to have their own unique style, attitude, quirk, tick, spasm, you get the point. Then they introduced Jahna Steele. My hopes, my dreams, my excitment lay shattered and gasping on the floor. I am then subjected to a victory charge by a woman who was actually laying on top of a table, obviously in constant vogue and giving face which incidentally has been tightened, tucked, sucked and pinned back so severely my own face hurt for a week. It was obvious this was all about HER not the others. And it was obvious she was torked to her fake tits. Plastic shouting out cliche's. On with the show; the rest was your typical interviews, numbers, talents, histories, puff peices and alot of shade. And of course Oprah, oh sorry I meant Dorae Saunders. So blah blah blah happens and it'd done. Mimi wins, thankfully. At the end you see bitter queens who are sore losers and even claiming discrimination. Ahem, Dorae. Hunty please. With the exception of Mimi, Maria and Erica all you have are bitter queens in a last desperate bid to find validation and acceptance but never really knowing the right way to treat themselves or others. Mimi, Maria and Erica are the only ladies who seem to have there crowns screwed on right. This was just a sad attempt to create a vehicle for a drag queen who's heyday was far passed her and to help her to move...What? oh yeah, she's dead.",1358899200,2,2042,4.491935483870968
