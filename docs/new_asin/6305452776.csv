7889753,5,6305452776,"This was the second Dragonball movie released during the series' Japanese TV run. This, like the previous DB is a re-telling of pivotal moments in the Dragonball TV series. The story re-tells Goku met Krillin and how the two boys began their training under the wise ""Turtle Hermit"", Master Roshi. In the movie, Master Roshi sends Goku and Krillin out to a spooky castle at the Devil's Hand to retrive a ""Sleeping Princess"" in return for martial arts training. As they arrive, Goku's friends are captured by the castle's residents. Lucifer, and Igor and both he and Krillin must save Bulma from being used as an involuntary blood donor and prevent Lucifer from blowing up the sun and overturning the Earth with monsters.",1127779200,,719,4.853658536585366
7889754,4,6305452776,"I watched this originally in Japan, it was great!  I was disapointed that this selection was not available on DVD.  The other problem I had was the sound keeps cuting in and out, VERY ANNOYING!!!  Otherwise the movie was great especially when Master Roshii gets his magazine.  The fighting sequences are great and it begins the lifelong friendship of Goku and Krillin. I would recommend this for any collector, it's fun to watch.  Introduced is also Lunch who changes from Blonde to Brunette when she sneezes very Lara Crofty.",981417600,,526,4.865168539325842
7889755,2,6305452776,"First of all, the plot was, well, bad. It just didn't seem to have the same spark as the rest of the series. Second, none of the original voice  actors signed on to this, and the replacements were annoyingly bad. Even  the animation seemed like whoever put this together didn't care, they just  needed the excuse to bring in Krillin(which was a decent part of the plot,  if the only part). I may be overly picky, but this video just wasn't up to  par with the rest of the series. Oh well, I'll drown my sorrow in DBZ.",966297600,3,517,4.23469387755102
7889756,3,6305452776,This movie is very good especially since no one realeased the rest of the series in English.  I am not really a big fan of how quick the movie went  and all they really got to do was introduce the characters.  Even though  clear editations are made I only recommend this if you like the other parts  of the series.,966211200,2,314,4.166666666666667
