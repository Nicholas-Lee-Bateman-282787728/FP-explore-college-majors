8384102,5,B002Y9NF1Q,"It is challenging to find workouts that use ""fitness loops or resistance bands"" and are focused totally on legs, thighs and butt.  I like Barry's concept of 1 minute of maximun exertion and 30 seconds of rest.  This 15 minute focused interval workout has a warm-up, cool down, and 10 exercises.  The exercises include various kinds of squats, kicks, and leg lifts.  Half are standing, half are on the floor.  They look easy but I was really sore after doing them. There is only one exercise where you need to use Barry's Transformer.  This guy has a crazy character which makes this a fun and effective dvd. Recommended.",1332633600,3,620,4.694444444444445
8384103,1,B002Y9NF1Q,Like most of the people who have tried Barry's workouts I think that they are amazing. The problem is the first time I used the booty bands they snapped apart. This seems to be a common problem. I figured when I ordered that it probably wouldn't happen to me. I was wrong. I would recommend the workout just know that you will most likely need to replace the equipment.,1262908800,7,369,4.36231884057971
