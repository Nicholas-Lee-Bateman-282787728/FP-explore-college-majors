986679,5,6305203768,This episode from the Docter's third regeneration is one of the most well conceived and executed of the series.  John Pertwee(The Doctor) and Roger Delgado(The Master) are in fine form.  The story avoids some of the cheesy  pitfalls that hinder so many of the other episodes.,913507200,,275,4.934782608695652

986744,5,6305203768,"A bit long but still exciting and well done!  This is a six episode serial and the show is well done with a great story and good acting.  Of course the classy Jon Pertwee leads the cast as the doctors third incarnation.  These episodes were shown in America at least they were in Denver back in the seventies.  This serial has been restored to the best of their efforts and I think it looks pretty good.  The story concerns the master's plans to destroy the world and he uses a evil machine to help him do it.  This like many of the pertwee era features unit. I wish todays Doctor would have more unit stories. Anyways the extras are interesting as we get a 2009  documentary , at the time barry letts (producer ) and Nicholas Courtney (the unit commander) were still alive. (rip to both of them) A few other cast members also give rememberances , the director's tale of trying to get this done is the best part of it.  He was way over budget and was never asked to a another Doctor who story ,even though he had done four earlier stories.  I personally think that all the pertwee stories were highpoints of the series as the feel of the show was much more serious.  In spite of it's budget , this show was one of the high points of early 1970's science fiction.",1404950400,,1262,4.286919831223629
986745,3,6305203768,"A pretty good romp with The Doctor and The Master dueling over yet another of
The Master's plot for world domination. There's also plenty of comic relief in the
back and forth between the Brigadier and The Doctor.

The story drags on a bit too long. It runs for six episodes when it could've easily
been done in four.

All in all a fun Dr. Who adventure.",1404172800,,354,4.268656716417911
986746,4,6305203768,"This is a fascinating serial featuring a mind control machine that removes evil from prison inmates. While visiting the prison where it's used in place of  capital punishment, the Doctor that even those using the machine don't have answers as to where ""the evil"" goes. The Doctor senses that an evil creature is inside and when the Master turns out to be involved, truly the Doctor and UNIT are in for a challenge.

The concept is an intriguing and creepy one, with some thought provoking moment. Jo has some good moments as well. The Brigadier is his usual charming and dashing self. The Master's plot still seems very Bond villainesque but better thought out than his previous alliance with the Autons. The one big flaw in the Master's plot is why he was killing envoys to the peace conference. We learn that the Master's plan is to blow up the conference to ignite a global conference to cause a worldwide disruption. It's not a horrible plan, but why the devil kill individual ambassadors in advance? All that did was clue in UNIT.

The story gave some nice looks at characters under influence of the machine. We learn the Doctor is still haunted by the events of Inferno. And the Master...well he has his own big fear, but I won't spoil that part.

Finally released in color, this remains a good solid eighth series Doctor Who story.",1395014400,,1338,4.656779661016949
986747,5,6305203768,"As usual I won't go into the plot but I will say Roger Delgado is still amazing as the Master.  This guy just exudes the poise, confidence and style of a great bad guy.

Ok onto what counts, video is nice and clean, no skips and consistently good sound.

986748,5,6305203768,I've seen this story before but this is the first time in color. It really makes a difference. It's like seeing it for the first time.,1392076800,,134,4.1923076923076925
986749,5,6305203768,"This is my favorite 3rd Doctor story and I first saw it in black and white and loved it. The black and white really enhanced the intrigue and the story, unfortunately when bought the DVD opened it up I was horrified to see they had actually gone and COLORIZED the story!!! Immediately I went to the color option on the menu to my TV and turned the color down to a glorious black and white!!!!
When you get this please do the same, you will be doing yourself a tremendous favor by getting rid of the color for this great episode of Doctor Who and in my personal opinion the best of the Pertwee era!
My other fav Pertwee episodes are Planet of the Spiders, The Dinosaur Invasion, The Green Death and Day of the Daleks, but I think The Mind of Evil was really his best story overall. Please enjoy it and relish it but ONLY watch it in B&W. You can turn the color back up when you watch the special features. The making of the story is really even though the director was never able to do a DW show again. It's really too bad because he was one of the better directors in the show's history.
Okay, I am reviving my earlier statement due to being corrected on this note, The Mind of Evil has not been colorized but color-restored point of fact. Personally though I will still view this story in B&W because it just works for me. I don't like how the color seems washed out and the edges blurry because of the recolorization or restored effect. What have you. I originally saw this story in B&W but the BBC had lost the color tapes for years and only the B&W version remained. I originally saw The Mind of Evil in black and white and I think the starkness and boldness of that works much better for this story. The color photos I've seen from this Dr. Who are sharp and colorful but to my eyes this DVD is somewhat blurry-looking and washed out in color.",1390521600,,1848,4.252840909090909

986802,5,6305203768,Although it is quite a contrast to the revised Doctor Who series this is a great classic episode. I like the older episodes as being more philosophical. This was actually the last episode of Jon Pertwee that I needed to complete my collection.,1376179200,,243,4.674418604651163

The Doctor and Jo show up at Stangmoor Prison to see a new machine called the Keller Process which can remove any evil impulse from any living being. Meanwhile UNIT has their hands full dealing with the World Peace Conference. This well written six part story features a lot of Cold War drama and is very well done. As far as the picture quality, this was one of the colour stories that was wiped by the BBC back in the seventies. The print that exists in the BBC's vault was a poor quality black and white print. This proved to be one of the Doctor Who Restoration Team's biggest problems in terms of clean up. Thankfully, they've done a pretty magnificent job at restoring the episodes and, along with chroma dot recovery and Stuart Humphryes, the colour is also back. There are a few spots where the colour goes a little wonky but considering the source, it's quite amazing.

986805,5,6305203768,"This was always one of my favorite Doctor Who stories; I recorded the B/W version off of PBS sometime in the mid-80's on the Betamax, and my copy was pretty well worn out!",1374278400,,171,4.212121212121212

The Master has hatched another one of his overly-complicated plots to destroy or take over Earth.  This one involves a new device that removes evil from criminals' minds, a missile, a prison riot, a peace conference, and Chinese woman whom Captain Yates thinks is ""quite a dolly"".
The story is really good, picture quality is excellent for the most part.  I have not looked at the extras very much yet or listened to the commentary.  Seems like this should have been a one-disc set rather than two because I was expecting more extra material.
Still if you love the 3rd Doctor era, this is worth picking up.",1373587200,,781,4.395833333333333
986807,3,6305203768,"Love the story, a Pertwee era near classic.  Drags a bit being 6 parts but has some great elements with the Keller machine, the prison takeover & re-taking by UNIT, the missile and the sabotage of the Peace Conference.  The Master in fine form.  The problem is that he original color versions were junked by the BBC and only a black & white copy remained available.  Other Pertwee stories have been revived in color thanks to the discovery of Betamax tapes from Canada.  The BBC was able to re-color episodes from those tapes.  But none exist for this story so they tried it without a source to work with.  The results were poor.  Skin tone constantly changes, fast movement blurs.  I wish they had kept a B & W version on the set for those not wanting to get seas sick from the color presentation here.",1373587200,,803,4.445205479452055
986808,5,6305203768,I am not the type of Doctor Who fan to purchase all of the DVDs and I am very glad I chose to purchase this one.

986851,5,6305203768,"Because the BBC had wiped its color tapes, one of Jon Pertwee's best stories has been available only in black-and-white. Through technical wizardry the color information has now been extracted from the ""color dots,"" color-signal interference patterns on the black-and-white recordings. The patterns had been filtered from Episode 1, so it was manually colorized, but excellent color was derived from these color dots on episodes 2-6.

986855,4,6305203768,"In the Jon Pertwee era of Doctor Who with the episodes entitled ""The Mind of Evil"" we are taken to Strathmore Prison where a prisoner is to be the latest subject of Professor Keller's machine.  A device as he puts it that will remove the impulses of the brain that allow for anger, malice and the like to be removed from people with those driving thoughts.  The Doctor catches wind of this device and makes his way to the prison to see for himself. With Jo Grant in tow he wonders if this is a mircale of human invetion or something else.
  Meabwhile Captain Mike Yates along with a squad of U.N.I.T troops are currently on guard and escort duty to destroy a dangerous missile by order of the United Nations.  While the Brgaideer is dealing with the a meeting between The nation of China and the United States.  The Chinese aide is doing everything in her power to see that England is doing things right.  What the Brigadeer doesn't know is she is under the control of the Master and he has plans for this meeting between the two nations to not happen.
  With Sargent Benton on hand to keep and eye on her and to make ceetain that the Chineese goverment is not on some secert mission of there own.  As that is going on Professor Keller the creator dies suddenly in the very room where he performs the machine function.  With no clues and no way of understanding what happen only the Doctor can figure it out.  The prison seems to be getting out of hand as the inmates are getting angier and angier with every passing minute.  The American Ambassador to the summit meeting has been attacked by some unknown means.  The Chnesse goverent is to blame and Captain Yates is having  problems of his own trying to get the missle to its final destination.
  What do all of these things have to do with one another? Can the Doctor figure it out before it is too late?  Or will the Master finally win?  What does the Keller Machine really do?  All these question and more will be answered in ""The Mind of Evil"".",1371686400,,2000,4.383152173913044
986856,5,6305203768,"With this DVD release, the entire series for the third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) has been released on DVD.

This was the second show of the second season with Jon Pertwee as the Doctor, and Katy Manning's (Jo Grant) second show.

What can I say that hasn't been said?  This is a very standard 3rd Doctor story, with UNIT and the Master.

Ardent fans of the show will like the references to previous Pertwee stories, such as ""Inferno"".

The notes are, as always, fascinating bits of information.

I've just started the commentary; it is moderated by Toby Hadoke; in general, I don't like the commentary where he is moderating. Terrance Dicks and Barry Letts have some of the most enjoyable commentaries (on other DVDs), but there are lots of people commenting this time, so perhaps a moderator makes sense.  I just haven't enjoyed the other commentaries that he moderates, and I have no reason to think that this will be different.

I haven't started on Disc 2, so nothing to say about this.

Nice moments: The Master examining a machine that the Doctor has put together to stop the monster ""But this is brilliant!"" (with awe in his voice).  I can almost see him re-evaluating the Doctor as an opponent.

This was a great heroic show for Mike Yates; Sgt Benton does not come off well and earns the Brig's ire early on.  Benton's concern when Mike Yates is missing is very good.

An excellent Doctor Who of the time.",1371513600,,1409,4.610441767068273
986857,4,6305203768,"The short version of this review: The Mind of Evil is a five-star Doctor Who story, and the DVD is a nice three-star effort. Hence, four stars overall.

Now, to gas on a bit longer. Clearly one of the most underrated Who serials of all time, The Mind of Evil explores such interesting themes as the rehabilitation of criminals, brainwashing, Cold War politics, and self sacrifice. Timothy Combe's direction is well above average, the sets are convincing (by 1970s TV standards), and the acting is strong. The Keller Machine is one of the few Doctor Who monsters that truly creeps me out, and Roger Delgado's Master is arguably a top-five villain. (He's certainly super-suave and immensely cool.) In short, this is either a classic, or something close to it.

As for the DVD...well, it has a few shortcomings, mostly due to the fact that this is not a well-preserved story. For many years, The Mind of Evil existed only in a grainy, black-and-white format, despite the fact that it was originally filmed in color. (The BBC wiped the original color videotapes, I believe.) For this DVD version, the Who Restoration Team took on the unenviable task of colorizing the story and cleaning up the picture. The results are mixed. While the colors are fairly bright and attractive, the overall quality of the picture is a bit too soft. For this reason, I actually prefer the old black-and-white version of the story, which paradoxically looks less dated than the color version. (Besides, black-and-white is more atmospheric than color, and it suits this gritty story quite well.)

Meanwhile, the special features are fairly entertaining. A somewhat juicy ""making of"" documentary covers the serial's troubled production history. (Filming went overbudget, and as a result the director was never asked to helm another Who story, which is a shame.)  Then there are the usual (somewhat duller) features, like a look at the filming locations and the inevitable trailer for the next DVD.

Mainly, I would recommend this purchase because the story itself is so strong. It's one of the most downbeat Who tales ever, and also one of the best outings for the Master. Great stuff.",1371513600,3,2159,4.95303867403315
986858,5,6305203768,"The Doctor and Jo arrive at Stangmoor prison for a well-attended exhibition of the Keller Machine in the prison's Process Room. Professor Kettering presents: ""We no longer execute our hardened criminals and killers.... Science has abolished the hangman's noose and substituted this infallible method.""
The Doctor can't resist commenting, ""People who go on about infallibility are usually on very shaky ground.""
Kettering frowns, but continues, explaining discoveries that ""anti-social behavior was governed by certain negative or evil impulses. Now this machine, the Keller Machine, extracts these impulses and leaves a rational, well-balanced individual.... The negative impulses are stored in that reservoir box there.""
The Doctor: ""Where do they go after that?""
Kettering: ""No where, sir. I repeat, they are stored in that box.""

The Doctor is more than skeptical and we are too. George Patrick Barnham, a violent offender, is brought in to receive his sentence of reconditioning in the Keller Machine. But something goes wrong. Barnham gives a howl of pain and has to be taken from the room unconscious.

The Doctor is disgusted, but he has hardly begun to worry about that when a technician, alone in the Process Room, dies a painful death. Before the results of his postmortem are available, we find out that more is afoot. The first ever World Peace Conference is being held in England, and UNIT is handling security. In addition, UNIT has to guard a nuclear missile with a nerve gas payload that is being transported through the countryside.

With all that on his plate, Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart gets another headache. Captain Chin Lee, of the Chinese delegation to the peace conference, complains that important papers have been stolen from their rooms. If they are not found, the Chinese will withdraw from the peace conference.

What the Brigadier doesn't see afterwards, but we do, is Chin Lee burning the papers herself. But hold on, there's weird pulsing music playing as she does so, and she fingers a button-sized implant behind her ear.

Then the dead technician's autopsy results are available. He was scared of rats, and died of a heart attack with rat scratches on his neck. Next Kettering, alone in the Process Room, is horrified to see the Keller reservoir start pulsing, the music crescendos, and before you can say Jack Sprat, he's dead of drowning in a perfectly dry room. And he had a fear of drowning.

The Doctor is adamant that the machine must be turned off. He's in the Process Room trying to do so when the reservoir starts pulsing again. The Doctor tries to fight it but it's beating down on him. What terror will the Doctor see? What would scare him so bad his heart would stop?

And that's the end of Episode 1. This is quite a long setup - but you'll see that it's worth it. All the different threads comes deliciously together. If the Master should happen to show up - of what would HE be most scared?

I really like ""The Mind of Evil"". The convoluted plot is a doozy. Not even Jo's irksome chirping can throw me off it. ""The Mind of Evil"" first aired Jan/March 1971, six episodes of 25 minutes each. This is a review of the 2013 two-disc DVD release, the first time it's been on DVD. It was released on VHS in black & white (the only format BBC had kept). But this DVD will be in fully restored color. If you know about these things, the Chroma Dot color recovery process was used to restore the original color in episodes 2-6. Episode 1, however, had to be manually recolored frame by frame by Stuart Humphryes (AKA YouTube's Babelcolour). [Recommended youtube viewing: ""The Making of 'The Ten Doctors Part One' by Babelcolour""] Also, of course, the DVD has digitally remastered picture and sound quality.

Trivia: Some exteriors, primarily for Stangmoor Prison, were filmed in and around Dover Castle. This serial went so excessively over budget that its director, Timothy Combe, was not allowed to be considered for any subsequent Doctor Who work. [See comments in Special Features 1 & 4.]

Extras for the 2013 DVD release:
DISC 1 Special Features
1.  Commentary. Toby Hadoke (fan extraordinaire, also has a 1-man Dr. Who show) moderates, with commentators include Barry Letts (producer), Katy Manning (plays Jo), Terrance Dicks (script editor), Pik-Sen Lim (plays Captain Chin Lee), Fernanda Marlowe (plays Corporal Bell), Timothy Combe (director) and Derek Ware (stuntman and HAVOC founder). I thought this was a very interesting commentary.
Dicks: ""I'm completely schizophrenic about UNIT. I think it's brilliant. I love Nick... and we both [Dicks and Letts] worked as hard as we could to get away from it and get the Doctor back into space.""
Katy mentions that ""The Mind of Evil"" was one of her very favorite series. It's interesting hearing her talk in her real voice, and not in Jo's an-octave-higher voice.
Letts comments on how a lot of the single-line players and extras were stuntmen, rather than just actors, because ""The Mind of Evil"" has a lot of fight scenes. ""Unfortunately, you had to pay these people as stuntmen, which was quite expensive. And to be honest, using HAVOC was one of the reasons this was one of the most expensive Dr. Who's that I ever did. And the sets, the prison set. Because originally, we intended to shoot the prison scenes on location. But no prison would let us do it. So, to build it in the studio, and to build a two-story set like that, and one that didn't wobble about all the time... it cost the Earth.""
Other major expenses: 7 1/2 days location shooting, a helicopter added at the last minute, location shooting negative scratched resulting in re-shoot, the set-up and special effects for the teleporting Keller Machine
2.  Information Text. Lots of interesting detail. ""In the draft scripts, the Keller Machine was called the Malusyphus, implying that the process siphons off malice."" (If you mangle the Latin a bit.)
The Chinese dialect the Doctor speaks (aka Pertwee attempts to speak) is spelled Hokkien.
The Doctor and the Master have to make an uneasy alliance in more than one serial. Having the Master stuck on Earth at the same time as the Doctor helps with one problem: ""It was implausible to have a succession of alien monsters seemingly queuing up to attack [Earth]. In the 1971 series, all the threats the Earth faces are a direct result of the Master's machinations.""
3.  Subtitles in English

DISC 2 Special Features:
4.  ""The Military Mind: Making The Mind of Evil"" (23 minutes) Commentators include Pik-Sen Lim, Terrance Dicks, Barry Letts, Fernanda Marlowe, Tim Combe and Nicholas Courtney (plays the Brigadier, d. 2011). This special was filmed before the colorization was complete, so all clips are in B&W.
Many things are covered, but there is quite a bit about the budget problem. Though Letts admits that ""Tim's a very good director, indeed."", he isn't glowing about how the show went overbudget. Fernanda says, ""In later years, watching it again, I realized how good it was... I'm not sure he [Combe] got the support he should have got.""
And I was touched when Combe said, ""I felt that perhaps there's been some misunderstandings.... I thought I'd be going on to do more Doctor Who's. But unfortunately, that was the last... I didn't have a sonic screwdriver to fix things up... I find it difficult talking about this right now.""
But then, we realize the BBC had to have a budget, and something, perhaps, had to give.
5.  ""Now and Then: The Locations of The Mind of Evil"" (7 minutes) Dover Castle, for one, looks the same. While watching this extra, I remember thinking, ""Why didn't I notice that this storming the prison scene had a seriously ruin of a wall standing in the middle of a prison?""
6.  ""Behind the Scenes: Television Centre"" (24 minutes) This is a TV show episode, presented by Norman Tozer. We meet him outside the giant BBC Television Centre, where, he tells us, ""over 4,000 people"" work on BBC TV shows. Over a 24-hour period, Norman visits different departments of different shows. In the sets department , we see a label indicating that a set is for ""DR WHO - PRISON HOSPITAL"". And then there's a model sitting on a table with a note: ""PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH OR REMOVE THIS MODEL"". It's a scruffy miniature of the TARDIS.

986859,5,6305203768,"My original review on the VHS release:

I still think ""The Claws of Axos"" is my favorite one in this season, but now after seeing this one, this one is right up there with ""Terror of the Autons"" as being my second favorite.

First, here's what I don't like about this one, it's in black & white. It was originally made in color, but the color prints were lost and now all that survives is black & white copies. Although there are about 5 minutes of color footage that remains from Episode Six which is included as a bonus feature at the end. But then again, it doesn't matter to me if it's in black & white just as long as it's good, and it is. After all, all of the William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton stories were made in black & white, and I love them. But still it's a shame that this one didn't survive in color.

Apart from that, this story was excellent. All of the episodes were action-packed with each episode getting better and better. You've got a great plot about countries trying to make world peace while the Master threatens to steal a dangerous missile and use it to provoke a nuclear war, you've got a killer machine (named the Keller Machine) with a creature inside it that sucks the evil out of men's minds, but then becomes too powerful and threatens to destroy everyone in its path, and you've also got one or two prison riots in this story. The Keller Machine was a very effective villain, and the Master has one of his best performances ever. You've also got the whole UNIT gang with it. It's just great, and is highly recommend!

My new review on the recently released DVD:

I seen the recolorization of ""The Ambassadors of Death"" and wasn't that impressed by it, but the recolorization of this adventure was surprisingly very good. I really enjoyed watching it in color and think you will too.",1235174400,3,1821,4.440119760479042
986860,5,6305203768,"This is my all-time favorite Dr. Who story.  The evil of the prisoners is quickly dwarfed by the rapacious evil of the hungry creature inside the Keller Machine.  Given that it soon learns to move right through walls, the suspense factor increases, as you never know where it will show up next to gobble up the minds/life forces of a few victims.
This classic Pertwee story includes a good moral look at what evil is and what it fears the most.  And the fact that it is all in black and white keeps the story gritty, displayed in muted tones against sufficiently dull backgrounds to keep the look and feel of the prison real.  In this one instance, I can forgive the BBC for having trashed the color copy.  I think B&W improves this one.
Add to this mix the current (at the time) tension with communism, the fear of nuclear war, and you've got an interesting, thought provoking Doctor Who classic.",1087516800,12,897,4.512345679012346
986905,4,6305203768,"This was a very good set of episodes of Doctor Who
entitled ""Mind of Evil"" which had an interesting
premise the Doctor (Pertwee) and Jo (Katy Manning) investigate a machine that feeds of evil and kills
those who are consumed by it. Very neat. Now throw in
some special effects, and the menacing character
of the Master (Roger Delgado), a murder conspiracy,
the Brigadier (Nicholas Courtney) and there you
have a great story.
If you don't know who ""The Master"" it was an evil and
rather brilliantly created arch enemy to rival that of
the Doctor. Just like Lex Luthor was the arch enemy to
Superman, ""The Master"" was the nemesis to  ""The Doctor"". He had special powers such as hypnotism,  and the power to change form. Also like ""The Doctor""  he could also travel through time. Roger Delgado  did a great job establishing the role, before he unfortunately he died in a car crash.
As stated The Doctor and Jo Grant are investigating
a machine that feeds of evil, although they don't know
it yet. They receive an invitation to a mental prison
where a new machine is being used to try to  rehabilitate criminals, the Keller Machine, created by Professor Kettering (Simon Lack). However, the machine does  not help the prisoners, but it kills them. At first  Professor Kettering does not know what to make of it.  When Doctor and others investigate the murder they  find the victims are being killed by their own fears  , which are in part fed of the evil inspired by the victims.
Meanwhile Unit and Brigadier are hosting a peace
conference that has gone wrong when certain important
delegates are missing. The Brigadier thinks these
mishaps might be due to a sinister female Chinese
Captain named Chin Lee (played by a real life Asian
woman named Pik Sen Lim). I don't know too much about
Miss Sen Lim, but she looked like a great actress
(and she was pretty too). This was a big deal because
Asian actors were practially nonexistent in the
1970's up until now. The only Asian persons that
got speaking acting roles were  action stars and celebrities like Bruce Lee.  Take into consideration that these episodes were  done in 1971, right in the middle of Vietnam, so there
was a considerable amount of hate and racism toward
Asian people and actors in general, but the  BBC prooves here that they weren't one of them,  so in that regard the BBC deserves alot  of respect and credit.
Anyhow, the Doctor himself tries to find out how to stop
the Keller machine and is almost killed himself (in a
rather badly special effected, but otherwise  entertaining scene). However, that's the start of the problems for Doctor and Unit as it's revealed that the Master (Roger Delgado, one of the best actors in Doctor Who)  has been playing a hand in the machine, the mishaps  of the peace conference, and the mysterious Chinese
Captain.
Overall, this is one of the most  interesting Pertwee episodes out there, but  it has been somewhat overlook by Who fans. However,  you should definitely check it out. It has
a rather great story, the effect ain't bad, and theyre
is much action and the episodes are unpredictable.
You should definitely watch this episode ""The Mind Of Evil"".",1083369600,8,3162,4.7005444646098
986906,5,6305203768,"Ok I realize the term ""serendipity"" was made famous in another John Pertwee story, however, serendipity definitely applies to Mind of Evil.  The BBC's wiping of the color tapes turns out to be a blessing. Mind of Evil works better in monochrome.  Watching it in color would make it lose some of its sinister feel.

Nowhere is this sinister aura more convincing than when the Keller Machine is working its magic.  The images of the victim's hidden fears surfacing are simply astounding, an effect that would suffer if in color.  The shootout at Stangmoor prison in episode 5 flashes back to the mob films of the 1950s, effective only if witnessed in black & white.

Not even the Doctor is immune to the power of the machine.  In a terrific cliffhanger, he is left alone in a closed room at the mercy of this abomination, bearing witness to his biggest fear, fire, perhaps a hold-over from Inferno.  Only Jo Grant's well-timed entrance at the start of the next episode breaks the hold of the machine to save him.

Roger Delgado steals the show as the sinister Master/Professor Keller.  We truly get the sense that he created a monster he can't control when the machine turns on him.  During this scene, we're given the revelation that the Master's biggest fear is, indeed, the Doctor.

Mind of Evil is a well-done, well-acted, story of intrigue and espionage, and these qualities are only enhanced by the lack of color, intentional or not.",1078099200,2,1437,4.7269076305220885
986907,4,6305203768,"Quite an eye opener for fans of the Doctor.
The premise of the story lies in the ability of the Keller machine to remove evil impulses from men's minds. It is thus seen as a beneficial aid to social development and the answer to the dreams of penal reformers. Alas the situation is much more complex.
At the same time there is another peace conference in prospect while the plot is complicated by UNIT having to move a nuclear missile while the conference is in session.
The writers of this Doctor Who adventure were clearly cognisant of contemporaneous world events and had no hesitation in including them as an integral part of this youth orientated show.
The Doctor is portrayed as a sceptic and this alone ensures his attendance at the prison where the Keller machine is based only to experience the first indications that something is seriously wrong.
The plot has been well documented elsewhere among these reviews so I will not repeat it here.
This particular adventure is one of the more overtly political of the series, exploring issues of crime and punishment and war and peace. There are some stereotypical views portrayed, with the Chinese, not the Soviet Union being exposed as the villain of the piece and of course it is the American delegate whom the Master is attempting to assassinate.
The question of penal reform is clearly a central concern as is the obvious conflict between the call for peace and the ownership of nuclear weapons.
As far as the actual production is concerned there is some good footage of action shots on location but these are undermined to some degree by the ineffectual studio portrayal of the prison.
Overall this is a steady performance, not one of the best but one certainly with some provocative and controversial ideas.",1034121600,3,1767,4.815789473684211
986908,5,6305203768,"Sadly this third Doctor story is only available in black and white as all of the colour copies were lost. ...P>The central theme of this story is the Master once again trying to bring chaos to the earth in a plot to destry a major peace conference. Roger Delgado, again someone no longer with us, is evil incarnate but you have to love him nevertheless. His portrayal as the Master as a foil to the Doctor was a highlight of the Jon Pertwee Doctor Who years although it has always puzzled me why the timelords should act against the Doctor yet allow the Master's interventions.
The story once again involves outside broadcasts on location and casts the British Prison Service in a poor light suggesting that experiments should be allowed on prisoners in order to achieve a compliant and co-operative prison population.
As the story develops from the focus of the prison and the Keller machine for removing eveil impulses to incorporate the wider focus of the world peace conference, the show attempts to demonise the Chinese under the leadership of Mao Tse Tung as the protagonists in a plot to create war, firstly through the use of a female Chinese official as a murderer of one of her own delegation and then through an attack on the American delegate. Reflecting the cold war realities of the time it's use is limited by the existance of the Master who merely uses his alien technology to manipulate people and alien life forms to achieve his own ends.
A strong story the main weaknesses of the 'Mind of Evil' for me involve the poor set for the prison scenes, the drawn out sections of the Keller machine and the length. There certainly was a tendency in the Pertwee years for six part stories but to my mind a number of them could have been considerably shorter including this one.
The strengths of the story are greater than the weaknesses including a strong plot with sub-plots and it's contemporary relevance. It is hard to imagine a world on the brink of war but that was a possibility more than once in the period between 1960 and 1980. Topicality too given Richard Nixon's visit to China and the continuing conflict in Vietnam...",1017792000,2,2141,4.666666666666667
986909,4,6305203768,"The initial scene in The Mind Of Evil is reminiscent to that of A Clockwork Orange, the controversy of aversion therapy. In the Mind Of Evil, the theory is that ""anti-social behavior is governed by negative impulses."" The Keller Machine removes those evil impulses, ""leaving a rational, well-balanced individual who can take his place as a useful if lowly member of society.""
The Doctor visits Stangmoor Prison, the site of the Keller Process, because he is worried about it. His worries appear to be justified. First, the machine overreacts when treating Barnham, a convict. It turns him into ""an idiot or a saint."" Then, two people die in rapid succession under weird circumstances. A medical student dies of heart failure along with rat-like bites and scratches, and the machine's operator, Mr. Kettering, ""drowns in the middle of a perfectly dry room.""
It turns out that the machine houses a Mind Parasite that lives off people's phobias and kills them. It even attacks the Doctor by plucking his fiery experience from the doomed parallel Earth in Inferno.
Meanwhile, the Brigadier has to deal with the disposal of a nerve gas missile, the Thunderbolt, and the World Peace Conference. Things worsen when first, documents are taken from the Chinese delegates' quarters, and worse, the delegate ends up dead. A young Chinese captain is at the bottom of the latter, but who's her controller? Yes, the Master.
There's a funny scene when the Doctor and the Brigadier visit the delegate Fu Peng. The Doctor quickly wins over the forbidding Fu Peng by speaking to him in the Hokkien dialect, while the poor Brigadier, left out, watches them chatting over tea. The British may think they are civilized, but to the Chinese, they are barbarians. It's a classic example of Occident versus Orient. We also learn that the Doctor once met Mao Tse-tung, presumably during the Long March.
Jo proves herself resourceful when Mailer, a nasty piece of work, organizes a prison uprising. At first at his mercy, she uses her UNIT training to knock the gun out of his hand. Once Mailer's down, the uprising collapses. And she's ever the gentle caretaker of the oversized Barnham, whose usefulness in dealing with the Mind Parasite emerges in Episode Six.
The Master shows himself to be a strategic and tactical genius here. He plans to steal the Thunderbolt and launch it, creating a world war. In the chaotic interim, he takes over. For this, he stages a second uprising, which succeeds, and hires Mailer and his thugs to hijack the Thunderbolt. He also succumbs to the Keller Machine, and guess what he sees as the embodiment of his fears?
This isn't a good story for Sgt. Benton, who is mentally attacked by the Mind Parasite and is clubbed by Mailer during the hijacking, or Captain Yates, who's injured in the same ambush, then captured at the hangar housing the stolen missile. Speaking of the ambush, the camera angle and the approaching motorcade reminded me of how Kennedy was assassinated and how the Grassy Knoll gunman must have been positioned, ready for a turkey shoot.
This is the only Pertwee story on video not available in colour, as those prints got trashed in the BBC purge. It's still enjoyable, though.
Result: A well-done James Bond-ish story crossed with a bit of international relations, and the human mind. Chinese Captain Chin Lee's accusing the ""imperialist Americans"" of stealing top secret Chinese documents is a well-timed and still relevant dig at us and our militant foreign policy.",1013040000,2,3497,4.938879456706282
986910,4,6305203768,"""The Mind of Evil"" is the story that perhaps best represents this era of Doctor Who. The last season had firmly established the new direction for the show. The Doctor, played by Jon Pertwee, would be earthbound and unable to pilot the TARDIS. This would see more ""Earth in danger"" stories, set in the present day, with UNIT playing a major role. This story encapsulates all that - it is also one of the best portrayals of the ""UNIT family"" - the Doctor, Jo, the Master, the Brigadier, Captain Yates and Sergeant Benton. On top of all this, it is a very fine story, well written (by Don Houghton, who also wrote the excellent ""Inferno"") and directed (Timothy Combe). The story has great moments of suspense complemented by moments of action, with terrific stuntwork courtesy of Havoc, who had contributed to earlier Pertwee stories, making them look more big budget and less like cheap sci-fi. The hijacking of the Thunderbolt missile and the UNIT raid on the prison are the two biggest and most lavish of these scenes. The story is perhaps a little long - perhaps it could have been one episode shorter, and the first four cliffhangers are almost all identical, all involving the parasite machine in some way. But these are minor gripes - ""The Mind of Evil"" has excellent acting (especially William Marlowe as the desperate convict Mailer) and sometimes feels very much like a James Bond film. All the UNIT regulars have moments in which they shine (this is the fortunate period before UNIT became a mockery of itself) and it is good to see the Master's presence hidden until the second episode. Upon its original screening he would still be fresh in the viewer's memory from the previous story - they would possibly be wondering if he is behind all this, but the decision not to reveal him until the second episode is a clever one. It could just throw the discerning viewer off before surpising him/her. Also, being in black and white makes the story even more atmospheric. It takes nothing away. For once in Doctor Who, the climax is not rushed and the ending is very satisfying. A fine story!",975974400,,2095,4.695652173913044
986911,4,6305203768,"I came to Doctor Who through a series of novelisations published by Target in the 1970s and 1980s.  These novelisations were fast moving, and exciting.  When I finally saw the television programme I was distraught.  William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton, and Jon Pertwee had long since disappeared.  The release of a number of these early stories on video has eased some of that childhood trauma.
Mind of Evil is compelling second season Pertwee.  To Who afficionados, the second season means three things: The Doctor is earth-bound (which means the Brigadier and UNIT are involved); Jo Grant has joined the Doctor; and every story features a common villain, Roger Delgado's portrayal of the Master.
While all Pertwee stories were recorded in colour, this story is available only in black and white.  Do not be put off by this.  This actually heightens the atmosphere, and means that many of the worst excesses of CSO (or chromakey) are avoided.  With no irritating visual distractions (aside from the operation of the mind and its impact on various cast members) the viewer is left to concentrate on the story - and while perhaps one or two episodes too long, this is superior Who.
The script is by Don Houghton, responsible for the classic Inferno (the first Pertwee season close), and there are a number of links between the two stories.  Houghton's scripts tended towards social commentary more than his fellow scriptwriters, and here the effective storyline revolves around a prison, where prisoners are having their negative emotions drained from them (effectively lobotomising them).  Houghton's observations on prisons, and recidivism are not the stuff of high criminology, but they are an effective attempt through what was thought of at the time as children's television to address larger issues.  The lumbering state of those that have gone through the process offers its own comment on the need for balance in the mind.
On the sci-fi elements it hardly needs to be said that the Keller machine that operates this system is not all that it seems, and Professor Keller is a bearded gentleman familiar to most viewers.
This is a good introduction to Pertwee era Doctor Who.  Pertwee is more restrained than some of his eye popping hysterics of his first season, and the UNIT members are an effective team - and in later episodes given a chance to act militarily.  Katy Manning is still finding her feet as Jo Grant, but has started to work on the curious mix of vulnerability and resourcefulness that some found appealing.  Best of all, though, is Delgado.  He is a convincing villain - made to appear all the more malevolent in black and white.  He oozes menace.
You may not hide behind the couch, but you will enjoy this story if you accept it for what it is - well written, but cheaply made sci-fi.
Admirers of this will enjoy Inferno, and The Daemons, two other Pertwee era stories.",971654400,28,2893,4.897540983606557
986912,5,6305203768,"This may be my favorite Pertwee (3rd Doctor) story.  The era of the 3rd Doctor is typified in this story.  The typical 3rd Doc story involves the Doctor, Jo, UNIT (the Brigadier etc) and  situations that quickly get out  of control.  The Doctor and Jo go to Stangmore prison to observe the use of  the Keller Machine that supposedly removes the evil impulses from the  brains of convicts and makes them useful members of society again.  The  Doctor doubts the machines abilities and thinks the machine should be  destroyed.  He is correct but destroying the machine is easier said then  done.  While the Doctor investigates the Keller machine, the Brig has to  manage the security for a world peace conference which quickly becomes very  complicated.  And transport an illegal missile. The Keller Machine runs  amucks at Stangmore Prison and riots ensue, a diplomat is murdered during  the peace conference and the missile is stolen.  The Master is involved in  all of this.  The Doctor is great as usual.  The Master is as devious and  dangerous as ever.  And scenes where the Master and the Doctor are forced  to work together are amazing.  The Master even saying something like  ""What can I do to help?""  This was such a un-Master like thing to  say and mean that it was a shock.  But it was perfectly plausible because  of the circumstances. Jo who has been considered a bit of a ditz and a bit  wimpy by some is excellent here, helping to quell a prison riot.  The story  was filmed on location somewhere in England and it is absolutely wonderful.  UNIT was excellent in this story, perhaps one of the stories that show  them off best.  They appeared to be a well-oiled, professional group and  not the stooges they are accused by some of being in later stories.  The  Brigadier is excellent with his Trojan Horse tactic.  Benton and Yates were  ideal.  Yates, heroic and triumphant.  Benton getting shot and getting a  concussion but perservering.  The other characters were also good.  Mailor  the inmate was sufficiently thug-like and Barnham was well done.  This is a  great story.  If you have never watched a 3rd Doctor story before, or only  seen a few, or never seen any Doctor Who at all.  This is an excellent  video! A must have!",956793600,5,2245,4.678756476683938

This story shows where so many Doctor Who episodes could have  gone and didn't.  IT provides a fast-paced, interesting science fiction  adventure, while exploring complex moral and political issues as well.  I  particularrly enjoyed the subtle poke at the Brigadier's lack Euro-centric  attitude toward the Chinese, and the Doctor's reverance and respect for the  culture. This one challenges not only the limits of our willing suspension  of disbelief, but our interest in world politics as well.
Beyond that,  this is another example of how color doesn't mean better.  The whole  picture has an elegant feel and better-than-usual editing gives the  episodes a more cinematic sheen than the good Doctor usually enjoys.

7884990,4,6305203768,"The Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) travels with companion Jo Grant (Katy Manning) to Stangmore Prison to observe the latest in correctional technology--the Keller Device. The machine is used to remove all the evil thoughts and impulses from whoever is subjected to it. Professor Keller has used it over a hundred times in Switzerland and this demonstration will be the first use in England. The machine goes horribly awry and the Doctor begins to investigate.

Meanwhile, U.N.I.T. (the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce) takes on two missions. First, they are providing security to a world peace conference in London. Second, they will escort a Thunderbolt missile to its destruction. The Thunderbolt is armed with chemical weapons and is illegal, so they plan to dump it in the ocean so it can't be put to ill use. The conference has problems with the Chinese delegation, causing no end of problems for Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. He recalls the Doctor to help the situation, leaving Jo to cover the creepy problems at the prison.

The various threads take their time coming together but of course they do. If you know classic Doctor Who, the DVD cover spoils who the main villain is (though he is also mentioned on the back). He takes his time showing up, which fits the pacing of this six-part series. Only a few of the scenes look like padding to make the 146-minute running time. The story moves slowly but methodically to its conclusion in a satisfactory manner.

Pertwee isn't my favorite Doctor, his performance is uneven. The villain is very good. He doesn't have the over-the-top cheesiness that often comes with being a Doctor Who baddie. Jo is a competent, self-reliant, and compassionate companion--the sort of solid support the Doctor needs. Overall, the acting is good.

The production values are pretty high for Doctor Who. Since the villains are the machine and a person, there's no rubber suits or dodgy special effects constantly popping up. Only a few times the show looks dated and under-budgeted. They used Dover Castle for the prison exteriors which looks great and makes a good setting for drama and action. The synthetic music score is a little annoying and definitely dates the show.
