8222012,4,B000WAV8Q8,"A story of a young family, recorded since 1990 to a break-out on a New Year eve-1996 with hinted husband's mischigas (for a mild madness an  idiomatic Yiddish expression), his self-digging and a comic happy end.

Perhaps, such a hint itself requires a very positive mark for this rather doco-style student-psycho-notebook-sort movie.",1230854400,,333,5.384615384615385
8222013,5,B000WAV8Q8,"I loved this movie.  I thought that it had an interesting perspective of life and how relationships are.  I do recommend everyone buy this.  Matt Winston and Amy Smallman (who actually are married in real life) are really great.  Matt Winston is very funny, but also is serious in that he wants to change his life in the film.  This is a wonderful comedy.  If you want something new, watch this movie!  Matt Winston rocks!",1038182400,,422,4.546666666666667
8222014,5,B000WAV8Q8,"Shooting Lily is an example of what smart indie filmmaking should be about.  The story is simple, about the break up of a marriage, but the way the story is told is highly original.  The lead character examines his  relationship with his wife by viewing all of their home movies.  He comes  to realizations about love, life and what's really important.  I saw this  clever movie at a film festival where the director Arthur Borman spoke.  The film is shot in 35mm and video and the Borman told this tall tale about  how they had no money so they actually bought a top of the line Hi-8mm  video camera, shot hours and hours of film for a month and then returned  the camera!  (I'm using this same technique for my film -- hey, it's a free  camera!)  A great indie that must be seen!",937958400,2,781,4.333333333333333
