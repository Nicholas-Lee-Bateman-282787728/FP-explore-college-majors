4172257,5,B003R0MEOA,Dear Amazon and everyone else out there that did this show. Whats the hold up? The Urk Man is a great role model. The show just about always mentioned about God in Each show. We need more Urkel in our lives. PLEASE PLEASE BRING ALL THE SHOWS BACK AND ON DVD SOON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1302912000,10,282,4.4423076923076925
4172258,5,B003R0MEOA,"I really love Family Matters and hate how it always takes like 10 years for a whole series to come out.

4172259,5,B003R0MEOA,"How long have we all been waiting for Family Matters, a very American show loved around the world, to be released on DVD? It's now over 20 years since the first season was broadcast, the DVDs of which I and many others happily made our own last year. I hope Amazon, the show producers and actors don't bury this fine show under a mountain of red tape and time, spoiling it for future generations.",1298592000,9,396,4.364864864864865
4172260,5,B003R0MEOA,"I was so excited to finally see Family Matters on DVD. Today, there are so many shows that I don't feel comfortable watching with my children, however, this is not one of them.

I'm prayerful that additional season will be released for us to enjoy soon.",1290470400,16,253,4.5
4172261,5,B003R0MEOA,"This is a good fun show and I hope they continue to release more of it on DVD, as well as Step By Step.  The second season was a good balance of the original family stuff with Urkel.  Around the fourth season I think the balance began to shift much more towards Urkel taking over, but at this early point it manages to use his character without losing the other good elements.  Most shows hit some sort of creative high point the second season and this one is probably no exception-after a first season to experiment, the writers are usually able to perfect the format.  So, in summary, I hope this is released, as I know lots of us love to re-live our lost youth and there's no way better than putting out the complete Miller-Boyett TGIF lineup from ABC on DVD.",1289088000,10,762,4.345070422535211

4172295,2,B003R0MEOA,"I love this show, but why in the Hell does it cost 20 dollars per season for a show from the nineties??? Amazon, get real!!",1498089600,,123,3.96
4172296,5,B003R0MEOA,love this series,1494892800,,16,4.666666666666667
4172297,4,B003R0MEOA,One of the most enduring of the TGIF lineup. A spin off to 'Perfect Strangers' that was loved and watched by millions. The birth place of a 90's cultural icon....Steven Q. Urkel. The show is great. Casting never changed much so it wOne as like watching the Winslow family grow up. I love it,1494115200,,290,4.388888888888889
4172298,2,B003R0MEOA,I had these put up for a birthday since February. So they were just now opened. The 3rd disk had bad scuff marks on each side of the hole that prevents the disk from playing. I tried disk cleaner but it would not work. I have a disappointed son...,1493596800,,247,4.061224489795919
4172299,3,B003R0MEOA,"I have the first season of Family Matters on the DVD set. And this is the 2nd season of Family Matters that I also have on the DVD set, and it's a good season with good episodes. I also have seasons 3-8 of Family Matters on the DVD sets, and their also good seasons. There is also a 9th season of Family Matters, which is the very last season, but I don't like that season for a simple reason, so I wouldn't buy or get the 9th season to watch on the DVD set. Seasons 1-8 of Family Matters is what I'll just stick with watching, including this 2nd season.

Now let me just say that this 2nd season of Family Matters was when Jaleel White became one of the main characters on the show, and he became funny and famous playing (Steve Urkel). The first season did not have him as one of the main characters, so this 2nd season is the first season with him as one of the main characters. But in a few episodes from the first season of Family Matters, you do see Jaleel White play his character as (Steve Urkel), which was a character that was played by him throughout all the nine seasons of the show, including this 2nd season. And now that Jaleel White is all grown up and wiser, this 2nd season of Family Matters even brings back memories of him from when he was a youngster, and from when he first started playing (Steve Urkel). And the first season of Family Matters also does bring back memories of Jaleel White from when he was a youngster, and from when he first started playing (Steve Urkel). And again Jaleel White was in only a few episodes from the first season, but was not a main character.

This show Family Matters even came out with seven Christmas episodes, and this 2nd season has the first Christmas episode ""Have Yourself A Very Winslow Christmas"". And that Christmas episode from this 2nd season brings back good memories of the whole family celebrating Christmas on the show. The first season of Family Matters did not come out with a Christmas episode, and neither did the 3rd season. Family Matters came out with nine seasons, and this 2nd season and the seasons from 4-9 came out with Christmas episodes all together. And I do like the Christmas episodes of Family Matters, and again they do bring back good memories of the whole family celebrating Christmas on the show, but the Christmas episode from the 9th season of Family Matters is what I would do without watching. Because like I said, I don't like the 9th season and I wouldn't buy or get it to watch for a simple reason. I've seen the Christmas episode from the 9th season before anyway. So the Christmas episodes from this 2nd season and from seasons 4-8 of Family Matters is what I'll just stick with watching, and seasons 1-8 of Family Matters is good enough for me to watch.

The regular episodes from this 2nd season of Family Matters are also pretty good episodes to watch, and I love them all. And not only do I like Jaleel White in the show, but I also like all the other main characters. This 2nd season of Family Matters even brings back good memories of the Winslow family.

I would say that one of my favorite episodes from this 2nd season of Family Matters is ""Son"", an episode where Darius McCrary as (Eddie) is fussed over a lost screwdriver by his dad and plans to move out, but he and his dad ends up making up at the end. My favorite scene from that episode is where Jo Marie Payton as (Harriette) is pregnant with Eddie from years back in 1974, and her and her husband Carl starts to have him as a baby, during a terrible snow storm late at night. That's a true story Jo Marie Payton as (Harriette) discusses about with Eddie and Carl, and that's also something I would never want to forget from that episode, especially with seeing Jo Marie Payton as (Harriette) pregnant and having Eddie as a baby with her husband. And I do like the part from that scene with Carl holding Eddie as a baby, and loving and caring about him as his own son with his wife. And Jo Marie Payton is one of my favorite characters on Family Matters. I find her and Reginald Veljohnson as (Carl) really made such a lovely couple on the show, as far as being married. But I still do like Jaleel White as the main character of the whole show playing (Steve Urkel), though.",1493164800,,4244,4.3751584283903675

4172371,5,B003R0MEOA,"I belong to a generation who because of when we grew up got to watch Family Matters when it originally aired on ABCs TGIF lineup (later CBS) and in syndication on TBS among other networks. To me, Family Matters will always harken back to a time when my biggest responsibility was being a kid. Part of me wonders how I can possibly be objective under such a strong nostalgic pull but here it goes

Most Family Matters fans will probably talk of two (and possibly more) eras of Family Matters. The first few years (1990-1994) focused more on the Winslow family issues and their next door neighbor Steve Urkel. While the (1994-1998) years tended to focus more on Steves crazy antics and downright science fiction type inventions. These are my personal divisions not set categories and their definitely exists overlapping between the two eras.

Season two definitely belongs to the first era, although Urkel is featured more prominently in this season. The thing I noticed is how different Family Matters appears in comparison to shows of today. They tackled serious matters such as gambling or Carls inability to more on from a robbery attempt gone wrong, but they did it in such a way that was serious, but felt more real as opposed to the plasticity that exists with many shows today. The jokes are also for the most part not crude or cheap, so stand back and let yourself drift down memory lane.",1458604800,3,1395,4.713114754098361

4172769,5,B003R0MEOA,"This second season of Family Matters is truly hilarious. I recently purchased the first season and while I enjoyed it, the second season is way better. That's largely due to the addition of Jaleel White, who became part of the main cast. I already found the show to be funny, but Season 2 really got a lot of laughs out of me. I grew up watching this show and I love it to death. I recommend that you get the first season as well, but I'd get this one first if I didn't have it already.",1365379200,2,486,4.072916666666667

I remember how much I enjoyed watching this show in my early years of marriage. I purchased the first season as a Valentine's Day present for my 14-yr-old son, but it sat on a shelf for more than a week before I finally made the effort to actually put the DVD into the player and essentially forced my kids to watch it. Now they all love it, and my 8-yr-old daughter has asked for every season!

First, the menus look so bland and plain, as opposed to the typical colorful, animated menus found in most DVDs. Also, two episodes, Rachel's Place, and Ice Station Winslow, have scenes missing. Every other episode is uncut, though. This is still a DVD you should buy if you love the show as much as me. This season is not as good as the first or third, but it is better than every other season besides those two. It contains so many laughs and touching moments.

4172867,4,B003R0MEOA,"Family Matters is a perfect example of late 80s tv sitcoms. Nothing like the garbage that's so popular nowadays. I suppose you could find faults with the show if you really wanted to nitpick it, but really....why not just sit back and enjoy the show ? The menu are nothing to look at. They look as if they were made with Windows DVD Maker, or some other cheap program. But who cares about the menu ? The show is what's important. The quality is much better than what you see on tv. Slightly ""fuzzy"" at times, but what do you expect from a tv show that's over 20 years old ? The only thing keeping this set from getting a full five stars is the lack of extras. They could have done something for a show that was so popular and is still loved after all these years.",1341014400,,763,4.162162162162162

I highly recommend this season, and I cannot wait for the third to be released !!",1329868800,3,394,4.642857142857143
4172872,4,B003R0MEOA,"After having crossed both my fingers and toes, Warner Home Video has finally trotted out season 2 of ""Family Matters"" on DVD. This was the only season (1990-91) for which the show was in the Top 20 Nielsen ratings, and ""Urklemania"" surrounding Jaleel White's Steve Urkel character was in full-swing (remember Urkel-O's brand cereal?). This set includes all 25 episodes of season 2, including a few of my favorites such as ""The Science Projects"" (where Laura dreams that Urkel has built her an atom bomb for the school science fair), ""Cousin Urkel"" (the introduction of Steve Urkel's cousin Myrtle - played by Jaleel White in drag), ""Requiem for an Urkel"" (where Urkel and his bully Willie - a young Larenz Tate - duke it out in the boxing ring, after Urkel slaps him with a mitten accompanied by one of the funniest sound effects in sitcom history), and ""Life of the Party"" (where Urkel teaches everyone ""The Urkel Dance"").

Unfortunately for the rest of the cast, this is also where Jaleel White permanently broke out as ""Family Matters'"" biggest draw, and by season's end the Winslow family has permanently taken a back seat to the nerd next door (as can be seen from the DVD artwork). There are, however, a few Winslow family highlights, such as ""Finding the Words"", a touching episode where Paul Winfield plays Harriette and Rachel's long lost father, who ran out on them thirty years ago.

All of the episodes are the original ABC broadcast versions with the full theme song and no edits, except for ""Ice Station Winslow"", which is the syndicated version. The quality of the video varies from episode to episode - the season opener, ""Rachel's Place"", is marred by ghosting - but the video is always at least watchable. There is the possibility that I'm comparing what I'm seeing (original tape masters) to newer transfers of SD material - I feel most audiences won't really care about the picture quality, but it is noticeable on the affected issues.

There are no bonus features on the set, which, while par for the course for DVD TV season sets these days, is still a bit disappointing for this show, given its popularity at the time of its broadcast. If it were at all possible, it would be nice there were gag reels or vintage promo pieces for the show in the WB vaults that could be tossed out as supplemental features.",1329696000,2,2329,4.717444717444717
4172873,4,B003R0MEOA,"This is a great season with many wonderful episodes. The only things I have to gripe about are (1) picture quality. The episodes appear to be from a slightly worn tape. One episode appears washed out for about a second. (2) neater season one or two have special features.

One great thing is all episodes appear unedited.

I am thankful Warner Brothers is gradually releasing the series on DVD. But, they may want to check into the picture quality issues.",1329609600,2,455,4.675

4172946,5,B003R0MEOA,"Family Matters is one of the best sitcoms I've ever seen. Okay, maybe that's a little too far, since I've seen very few other sitcoms, but Family Matters is just that great. You see, when watching this show, there isn't really a need to go watch any other sitcom because you've got all the amazing and clever humor right here.

The characters in the show have personalities that are well structured, but the real star of the show happens to be Steve Urkel (played by Jaleel White), who is the nerd on the cover. His lovable dorkiness really adds to the show. When I watched the episodes of Family Matters that didn't have Steve (you know, the earlier ones), I thought they were funny. But when Steve came, this show's appeal suddenly grew to massive heights.
