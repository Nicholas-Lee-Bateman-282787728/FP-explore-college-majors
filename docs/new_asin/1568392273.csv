187029,3,1568392273,"Did the Polynesian Islands get seeded by men from South America? That might be tough to say based on this 1951 Academy Award winning documentary by biologist Thor Heyerdahl. But this is exactly what Thor and several other men try to prove by building a raft in Peru and drifting/sailing into the Pacific Ocean.

The film is interesting if very dated. The cartoonish depictions of the world map and their travels were often hard to watch, reminding me of some kid's crayon drawing scrawling across the screen, but informative in a kind of regressive nature.

The more interesting aspects of this 58-minute documentary were how involved the world was in the Kon-Tiki expedition (Ham radio operators were listening around the world), and some of the strange and new discoveries of fish species during their voyage.

But lost to me were the difficulties of the journey. More film time was spent describing the rigors of gathering the rare cork-like wood for their raft than was given to their actual struggles out on the water.

Once we're on the Pacific Ocean with them, we also feel that this is some sort of simple trip, as if they're just trolling around a lagoon (felt kind of Gilligan's Islandish). But this was also a bizarre strength for the film. In today's (2005) reality TV world, every bug bite that some contestant on Survivor receives is broadcast as if a limb were amputated, but here the men seemed minimally interested in the sharks following them and when their cooking facilities nearly burn up.

Scientifically, though, I think this documentary is a serious flop. The initial idea was to prove that the peopling of the Pacific Islands came about by ancient mariners from South America. Although I still believe this is true, doing it in 1946 with a sextant, cooking stove, experimental military food supplies, and other modern conveniences didn't set well in my analytical mind.

Final summation: watch it once if you're a film history buff. If not, stick with the book.",1121385600,7,1986,4.878338278931751
187030,1,1568392273,"Another Image Entertainment release, another disappointment.
From the fact that there is no menu...and no extras...to the fact that this is not the complete original release (this is the edited television release), this is yet another loser from Image Entertainment.
The original release is 78 minutes long, and has different opening and closing credits.
As for the movie...it is interesting for one viewing, but the poor quality of the pictures (not up to the standards of Thor's later movie ""RA Expeditions"") make it unlikely you will want to see it more than once.
My suggestion...stick with the book.",1071705600,27,604,5.173469387755102
187031,5,1568392273,"In 1947 Norwegian biologist Thor Heyerdahl and five crew members embarked on a 4,300 mile expedition across the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Polynesia by raft. Ridiculed by the scientific establishment, Heyerdahl wanted to duplicate the legendary voyage of an ancient race of settlers led by the mythical hero Kon-Tiki. The expedition attracted worldwide attention as one of the most daring feats of its day. Heyerdahl's story was told first in his book and then in this 1950 Oscar-winning Documentary Feature directed by Olle Nordemar. The story of ""Kon-Tiki"" is half Lindberg crossing the Atlantic and half Schleimann discovering Troy, since it has inspired not only other perilous voyages but archeological investigation.  This might be black-and-white photography, but ""Kon-Tinki"" is still an exciting documentary record of an epic journey.",999993600,9,842,5.5271317829457365
187032,5,1568392273,"I have just finished viewing the 1997 commemorative edition (Janson Associates, NJ) of this 1952 Academy Award for Best Documentary. It is 58 minutes of actual black and white footage taken by the crew of the Kon-Tiki. Thor Heyerdahl, the Norwegian biologist, had suspected that the South Sea Islands had been settled by an ancient race from thousands of miles to the east. He knew that the trade winds and ocean currents off the South-American coastline bear in the direction of Polynesia. The film shows how his team harvested balsa from Quito, took these huge logs to Peru and built a raft according to the traditions of pre-Columbian S.A. Indians. There are no nails on this craft; everything is tied by rope. Heyerdahl's team embarked on a 101 day of ocean voyage, often surrounded by sharks, sometimes whales so close they could look down their blow holes. How and what they ate and how they charted their journey is fascinating. The trip almost ends in disaster because of the coral reefs surrounding the Polynesian islands when they finally encounter land. It is a gripping and informative documentary and worth the Academy award.",979862400,30,1138,4.932291666666667

187035,4,1568392273,"Amazingly, I had never heard of the Kontiki until I bought a ""Kontiki"" watch and decided to read more about the Heyerdahl expedition, where he and his crew supposedly wore Eterna watches, who made the tribute watch years later to commemorate the expedition.

Heyerdahl is an excellent story-teller. I found the book difficult to put down, as he describes the 101-day 4000+ miles expedition with great detail and even whimsy. He writes with a sense of wonder, almost child-like. The culminating event is when the raft named the ""Kontiki"" is approaching one of the islands in the Polynesian chain, but their approach becomes life-threatening due to the treacherous reefs around the island.

He writes as an ethnographer and anthropologist with great respect for the people who are the subject of his writing. By building and navigating a raft built to the specifications of South American Indians he argued made the trip thousands of years earlier, he proved that they may have been able to navigate that distance and populate the islands. While his theory was not necessarily proven, he did  prove that the trip could have been made. All six of the crew returned safely.",1472256000,,1169,4.984615384615385

Wow! This was a great movie, even/especially if it was a documentary. It had a definite story arc, drama, the whole works.

And I got more than just entertainment, too. They shared a few stories about survival at sea that I'd never read or heard of, and I've been researching long distance sailing for a couple of years (for my upcoming book 'Fairies Down Under,' the story of the First Fleet of convicts to arrive in Australia). Did you know you can mix up to 40% sea water with fresh water and drink it, if working and sweating a lot, without any bad side effects? Neither did I.

The only down side was it was in black and white, but that was life back then.

Thanks, Thor Heyerdahl and crew, for sharing both in print and video, and proving your theories about ancient mariners.

Heyerdahl demonstrated how they fished and cooked and collected flying fish that landed on the deck overnight. We also see how they dove under the raft to inspect the rigging in their ""dive basket"". We see sharks following the raft and sharks speared and dragged on board to be killed and eaten. We see the giant ominous shark whale - largest creature in the seas. And we see pods of curious whales inspecting the raft and diving under it, leaving the raft safely in their wake. We see the radio men making contact with distant radio operators, and we see one of the crew taking sextant readings and plotting their progress across the sea. The grainy, black and white and sometimes jerky filming as well as the dramatic musical score contribute to the authenticity of this truly epic adventure.

187116,5,1568392273,"I read the book by Thor Heyerdahl first (HIGHLY recommend), and was thrilled to see the actual footage shot by the crew of the Kon-Tiki.  The very idea that a handful of men would set out to build a RAFT based on plans from a so-called primitive culture, sail it thousands of miles across the Pacific Ocean with NO backup rescue/camera crew (as they'd have today), with little knowledge of sailing... and MAKE IT... is crazy-brave, and makes this DVD a must-see (and the book a must-read) for anyone who appreciates adventure, daring, and the quest (against all odds) to realize a dream!  After reading the book I found the film skimmed very quickly through the story and outcome, so you'll definitely want to read the book to get all the details and learn just how difficult this endeavor truly was... from fund raising, to finding a willing crew, acquiring and hauling the the raw balsa logs, getting the raft built in time to meet their narrow window of opportunity for launch, ignoring the naysayers who told them the design was flawed, their idea would never work, and that they were all doomed, and finally, the trials, dangers, and joys of carrying out this voyage on a soggy wooden raft, alone in the middle of the Pacific!  It's quite simply... amazing!

187145,4,1568392273,"I thought it would be fun to go back and watch this Oscar winning documentary having just seen the terrific 2012 Norwegian dramatic adaptation.  The film only runs 58 minutes and is narrated by Thor Heyerdahl himself.  According to IMDb, the film runs 77 minutes, so I'm not sure where the other 19 minutes went.

The movie was released at the same time as his book, which documents his 6-man team (and 1 female parakeet) and their 5000 mile trip from Peru to Polynesia in 1947.  Some time is spent early explaining why Heyerdahl felt that the ancestors of the vast island chain had originally come from South America rather than the accepted Asia.  He spends some time showing how the raft was conceived and constructed but little about how he acquired financing.

Shot by Heyerdahl and his crew using a 16mm camera with no audio, the compilation shows some harrowing experiences although Heyerdahl's perfectly British accented English suggests that they were no big deal.  There were a couple exceptions.  They had a rubber dingy on board so that a crew member or two could float away from the raft to take pictures.  They quickly learned that the dingy even with 2 men paddling like crazy couldn't keep up with the Tiki.  The raft had no way of turning around so they were lucky to rescue the men by tossing a long rope.  Another incident involved a pod of whales that came very close to the boat and another involving a whale shark, highly dramatized in the 2012 film.

The normal sized sharks were always around but seemed to be of marginal concern to the crew.  In fact they fished for them and Heyerdahl has a throwaway line in the documentary where he says that at one time they had 9 sharks on board for food, experiments and chum.  Many of the events shown here are recreated in the newer film, but in most cases they are overly dramatized for today's audiences.  For example, the bird is eventually lost during some turbulence.  In the new film she is caught midair by a shark.

I was surprised that Heyerdahl doesn't mention his crew more by name in the narration or explain what their primary purpose was.  We don't get very close to them.  Still the voyage was a remarkable achievement and the resultant film is as well.  A bit more excitement in the narration would have given a better sense of the true danger.  I will also mention that the Heyerdahl crew seems to be a bit overjoyed when it comes to beating their fresh catch to death with hammers and clubs.",1379116800,,2475,4.566893424036281
187146,4,1568392273,"The actual HISTORY in the making.  I remember reading about Kon Tiki in grade school.  This is that rare bit of movie history that is RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES.  It is amazing what someone can do when they set their mind to it.  The footage is grainy and the narration is a little bit like a librarian reading her/his favorite story in a language not his/her first.  I was, nonetheless, glued to the images!  Here before me was THE Thor Hyerdahl.  Not some actor or dramatization but the real person on the REAL Kon Tiki.

187151,5,1568392273,"THIS is adventure - the film's visual portion is completely made from video taken on this real epic raft journey. You can see sharks, whales, flying fish, a new species of fish, and more because it's all caught on video by these brave and adventurous men. The beginning was a little slow (launch the raft already!), but it still has interesting details about the doubters and works as a nice setup for this journey.

The narration is very smooth and coincides with the video you see. Combined, they do an amazing job of giving you an idea of what life was like on this raft for the 100+ days they were on it. And I love at the end, how they chill out on an uninhabited island for a week (a dire survival scenario for some, but not for these men)! For them, it's vacation.

After seeing this, expect to have a newfound appreciation and wonder for the amazing ocean world that covers most of our planet. You'll long for their moments of bliss out on the open water, away from deadlines, noise, and pressures of the modern world. You'll imagine the camaraderie. But then you'll hear about the sharks following them, or imagine what they slept on, or think of their hours under the hot sun, or consider the fact that they don't even see land for 3 months, and find your bed extra comfortable tonight.

As an aside, please have a healthy fear of coral reefs. I was in Kauai this past August and we went off spearfishing on a private beach area that has reef all the way up to the shore where it turns to rocks, and it's only when you're in the water, being tossed around easily by waves driving you towards sharp coral reef, that you understand the dangerous combination of coral reefs and rough water. The local I was staying with said it was a ""calm day,"" but even as a competitive swimmer of 12 years, it still scared the crap out of me trying to find out how to get ashore without getting gashed.

much as the film crew was needed for help during the worst of times. Because of this we get a more subdued almost carefree feeling as we are privy to the
nice days and high times more than the storm days and the struggles. It struck me that Thor's concerns were in tune to today's concerns ecologically and spirtually. Even though his theory of Peruvians traveling to islands was incorrect, his notion of building simple raft crafts out of basic materials is a sound one, therefore demonstrating that primitive cultures could travel great distances for food, spice and supplies as well as anthropologically demonstrating a interracial culture could have developed due to such travels.
Enjoyed the pace and lack of ego as well as the throwback feeling from the use the B&W film, which was current technology for the time.",1371340800,,938,4.832298136645963
187165,4,1568392273,"After watching the 2012 theatrical film KON-TIKI, I wanted to view the real thing. Thor Heyerdahl's journey on a balsa raft across the unforgiving Pacific Ocean was a remarkable feat of courage. Heyerdahl proposed that the Polynesian Islands in the Pacific could have been populated by South Americans rather than by Asians, which was the accepted fact of the day. After 101 days and 4,300 nautical miles on a bolsa raft, he and his 5 fellow adventurers proved without a doubt that a raft leaving Peru could, in fact, could reach the Polynesian Islands. In fact, it was amazingly easy and far from impossible as he had been told.

The original Heyerdahl documentary is a complete step back in time. Although the recent theatrical version dramatized some facts, it did follow the real story closely. The theatrical movie had the advantage of filmmaking techniques and all the possible safety factors. Heyerdahl and his men were pioneers on so many levels. They brought along a movie camera to film their adventures. This was long before reality TV so it is amazing they men thought to document their story alone and without a film crew or safety features.  These men did everything and took all the risks. Obviously, pieces are missing in the story and are filled-in by the narrator. The ocean seems peaceful but there was a 5 day storm where no filming was done. The original Kon-Tiki is more authentic than any Hollywood creation. These men lived this adventure and surprisingly did quite well on the journey.

The version I watched is from Janson Media. It does have a menu with some bonus features to enjoy. I know Heyerdahl and his team filmed in black and white under harsh conditions, so I don't know if the film could have been enhanced for clarity. Again, this was 1947 and people weren't making documentaries on the high seas. The men were filming under harsh conditions and without today's high-tech cameras. A few rolls of completed film were destroyed by the environment.

The final documentary may be technically crude by our modern sensibilities but it is truly amazing. It does seem like more effort could have been used in the graphics and maps that explain the journey. The opening information scroll at the beginning is barely readable with the Kon-Tiki figure background. Keep the authenticity of the footage but it would be good to enhance the non-documentary footage.

Nothing beats the original KON-TIKI. Here is the amazing story of how 6 men crossed the Pacific on a raft. It is a no frills story. The drama was built in and there is amazing footage of sea creatures who followed the raft. It is realism at its best. The crew risked their lives to board a rubber dinghy (a bit of modern technology that did not affect the raft). Attached to a rope, the dinghy was prevented from drifting off in the ocean and views of the Kon-Tiki could be filmed from a distance. Amazing on all levels. No Hollywood crew or safety features. Here is the real and amazing adventure. Remember this adventure was filmed in 1947 long before all the technical advances of Hollywood and visual effects. Allow yourself to enjoy the ""real"" thing. It is truly amazing.",1371168000,3,3166,4.791208791208791

187177,4,1568392273,"In 1947, Thor Heyerdahl wanted to prove that the Polynesian Islands could have been peopled by native South Americans. He believed this was implied by Polynesian legends of  ancestors having arrived from the direction of the rising sun. It would have been possible because of prevailing currents and winds in the South Pacific, which flow from East to West. (The accepted view was that Polynesia was peopled by migration from Asia and Melanesia.) To show his theory was possible, Heyerdahl and 5 others built a balsa wood raft entirely of materials available 1500 years before and set out on the journey.. Amazingly, they succeeded in reaching an island after 101 days at sea.

Although the feat did not prove the South American origin theory, it did prove it could be true and had to be considered.

He was ignored because the ""experts"" said the South Americans had no ocean going boats in which to make the journey.  In 1947 using cash and equipment donations Heyerdahl and a redoubtable crew he recruited made a balsa log raft in the fashion depicted in ancient drawings, named it Kon Tiki for a native god and set sail from Peru to drift with the current and be pushed by the winds until he did indeed reach Polynesia and proved the ancient South Americans could have made the voyage.

187200,4,1568392273,"I read the KonTiki novel about 45 years ago, and even then it was many years since the original feat of rafting across the Pacific Ocean was accomplished by Thor Heyerdahl and his group.  I wasn't aware of the film when I read the novel, and have thought about the accomplishment over the years, and even moreso when I heard that a new feature film has been released that was made in 2012 and was a big hit in Norway, and spreading in popularity across Europe, and hopefully eventually coming to the U.S. soon.  In attempting to learn more about the current film, I discovered that Amazon had the original film with the actual footage of the journey made by the original crew and thought..""WOW"", here's a chance to see the real thing before the hollywoood types release their version.  So I saw it, and really enjoyed it.  The shots of the ample food suppy, the relentless pursuit of sharks, and the whale shark were really great.  The feat of allowing the currents and winds from the Trade Winds move the balsa wood raft toward the Pacific Islands over several months was proof that the descendants of modern Pacific Islanders were at least partially comprised of the people of South America, who made very large rafts from balsa trees that once grew near the coast.  All of the objections thrown at that theory were easily overcome with the reality of the KonTiki crew that not merely survived but thrived during the voyage, never wanting for water or fresh fish to fuel them on.  They tested the idea of satisfying the requirement of obtaining fresh water by drinking fluid from the glands of fish, ....not tasty but effectively providing fresh water.  The film is a good record of the voyage, but was unable to capture their struggle with at least two serious storms at sea, something the new hollywood production will no doubt be able to simulate.

He was on a speaking tour and my father was president of the Town Hall, which had invited him to speak about his incredible voyage.  At the time I was goggle eyed at this handsome man with a strange accent and quite fell in love with him.  I never forgot Kon Tiki and now I'm 75 years old and finally have the time to read all about it.  Like the author, I also enjoy making connections of events in history.  And I also believe that many myths that have been orally handed down through some cultures are based on fact. An anthropologist who studied both cultures, Thor Heyerdahl connected the population in Polynesia with the myth of Kon Tiki in Peru and set out to prove this connection by making the same seemingly impossible voyage by building the same kind of raft and sailing it along the same route as that taken more than a thousand years ago.  How brave! His portrayal of this voyage with 5 other men is a marvel.  At times I had to stay up late, unable to put the book down.  Other times I was relieved when my phone rang, since my heart was pounding so hard I could hardly bear it.  Other times, one appreciates the calm and serenity of being totally alone on the ocean on a tiny speck of a raft.  He states at the end or his story that he failed to prove this migration to the scientific community. He proved it to me, though.

This one-hour feature documents Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl's voyage across the Pacific Ocean in a balsa-wood raft, to simulate how South American natives might possibly have voyaged west and settled in the islands of Polynesia.

Crude, black-and-white grainy 16mm film, simple English narration. The production is bare-bones. But I've seen this film two or three times. Instead of ""reality TV"" which is far from reality, this is reality. Five guys who set out in a boat they did not know would be able to survive the distance, finding out by hard experience what it might have been like for any ancient mariner who tried to do the same.

Many days were calm, and the crew could lash the steering paddle down, letting the wind and the current carry them toward their Polynesian goal. They could get in a basket below the water line and watch the ocean life, or float lazily away from the main raft in a rubber lifeboat.

Every morning they got up and picked up the flying fish that had landed on the raft and been stranded. Breakfast! At other times they speared and clubbed dolphin fish (not dolphins) for a change of meat. They caught many sharks, mainly to discourage them from following the raft. They worried about whales and other large fish, but were never troubled by them.

In about three month's time, they arrived in Polynesia and were driven toward the coast of a small island. They very nearly were wrecked on the reef. It was by no means certain that they would make it safely to shore, but finally the raft came to rest and they were able to unload the important equipment, set up on shore, and radio their successful landing and their position. They met natives (wearing Western clothing) and eventually a boat was sent to retrieve them.

It was enlightening to learn that the men had very little knowledge about the blue whale and the whale shark as they felt threatened as the whales would swim towards the raft and then dive under it at the last moment.  The whale shark, which is completely docile and harmless did not deserve the indignant spear thrust into the top of its head.",1489622400,,458,4.6419753086419755
7796944,5,1568392273,"This is the much-deserved Hollywood film version (made in 2012) of the historic Kon-Tiki expedition accomplished in 1947.  The lead explorer, Thor Heyerdahl, did have a documentary filmed on-site which was an amazing reality show by 1940's standards.  It is still extant today on DVD and has an authentic impact - how could it not - that this film lacks slightly.  But this version captures the spirit of Mr. Heyerdahl and his crew very well while maintaining respect for the original documentary, and is aesthetically pleasing - by 2012 standards - also.  I would highly recommend watching the ""Bonus"" section of this DVD which, although it contains comments by some unlikely celebrities - Diane Von Furstenberg and Matt Lauer - it sets the expedition in the context of our current world-view.
What none of the films mentioned above can show is the inspirational impact the expedition had on the world after the horrors of two world wars. It gave us hope that we had not destroyed the world after all and that there were new frontiers to be found in it.  So we kept on exploring it!",1485129600,,1083,4.770053475935829
7796945,5,1568392273,Very good documentary.  Would like to suggest you reed his book about raft journey and Easter Island.  Heyerdahl reveals a lot of hidden history in his book on the subject.. .,1485043200,,175,4.612903225806452
7796946,5,1568392273,"This documentary is not only interesting, it is also funny and well edited. After having watched Kon-Tiki I cannot but be amazed by the courage and perseverence of certain men. This really is one of the last great adventures of man.",1484956800,,232,4.682926829268292
