4390096,5,B004J328XQ,"I have a small collection of Spot VHS tapes that my youngest son (now 20) loved as a little boy.  His nephew discovered these videos and watches them whenever he visits grandma.  Between my son and my grandson's love of ""Spot"" some of the VHS tapes have been worn out and I was extremely happy to find these videos in DVD formats to replace the old VHS tapes.  All the Spot videos are a big hit with my grandson and is something that only grandma has and occasionally he will take one home with him to watch.",1364947200,,508,4.216494845360825
4390097,5,B004J328XQ,I think the Spot adventures are uplifting  and educational.  I had several on VHS 14 years ago when I provided childcare for two of my grandsons and now a new set of triplets will be introduced to them.,1357430400,,202,4.2894736842105265

8431567,5,B004J328XQ,"My son is almost 3 and loves Spot. We have an old Discover Spot VHS tape and were pleased these newer shows were available on DVD. This one and the other new DVDs have 5-7 new episodes along with 2-3 Bonus (older) episodes. It is clear these were not animated or voiced by the same people who worked on the 1990's version. They are similar enough in style that my son does not seem to notice. While this is distributed by the BBC, the voices of the characters sound like they are North American.

Each episode is only about 5 minutes long and the feature length is only 30 minutes. The bonus episodes are also 5-7 minutes each and can only be accessed one at a time through a separate section. In this DVD the new episodes include: Spot's Birthday Party, Spot goes to a Party, Spot goes to the Fair, Spot sleeps over, Spot goes to the Circus, and Spot makes a Cake. The bonus episodes include: Spot's Show, Spot's Tent, and Hide and Seek. There is also a game, Painting with Spot, which we have not done yet.

Although it is short, all of the episodes are good and my son could watch them repeatedly without getting bored. They are simple and kind of boring for most adults, but they are also sweet and help little ones figure out some basic social situations. In particular, this one was good as we were preparing to attend his friends' birthday parties.",1403222400,2,1355,4.394422310756972
8431568,5,B004J328XQ,this is a cute dvd for Spot's b-day...who doesn't love Spot!!  This dvd is very entertaining for a 2-3 year old,1399161600,,111,4.285714285714286
8431569,4,B004J328XQ,"The 'Spot' books are always fun. The book is
hard bound, stands up under lots of rough treatment
and being 'baby-tasted' as well.  The colors are
bright. Drawings are simple.",1396915200,,174,4.8
8431570,5,B004J328XQ,"my granddaughter loves the spot books., she is just learning to read, and likes to be read too.  She loves them.",1393718400,,112,4.333333333333333
8431571,5,B004J328XQ,"No sarcasm, no mean talk, no arguing, no intense scenes. We've shown our 2 yr old movies like ""Cars"", but are selective of which scenes. It's tough for a 2 yr old to understand why people can be rude/rough to each other, so I'd rather not let someone so impressionable find something negative to emulate. Enter Spot: just clean, wholesome, non-flashy entertainment.

I personally find Tom (alligator) a little creepy, but our 2 yr old doesn't seem to mind. ;)",1375228800,,459,4.7375
8431572,5,B004J328XQ,"My 2 and 4 year old grandsons adore Spot, his books, his dvds, and the toy.  They want the Spot books read to them over and over.  This dvd was perfect as the 2 year old just had his own birthday party.",1365465600,,202,3.7857142857142856
