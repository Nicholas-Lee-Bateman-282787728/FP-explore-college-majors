7970866,1,B00005M0JE,"I Totally Disagree With The First Reviewer's Comment...; This Flick Is a Disgrace To True Wholesome Martial Arts. How Could They Put Cheng Sing With Bruce Lai In The Same Flick...?! It Doesn't Make Sense, Cheng Sing Has Been Shortchanged In Doing This Film. Besides, I Cannot Bare To Watch Bruce Lai, Period....! He Disgust Me !  Anyways, This Is Not A Good Movie And I Wouldn't Recomend Anyone Even Attempting To Buy It. It's Subtitiled, And The Original Language Is Chinese, Which Makes It Even More Boring. Ugh.....!!!",1179964800,,521,4.853932584269663
