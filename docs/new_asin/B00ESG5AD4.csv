The dvd is easy to navegate. The color is clear and good. The sound is perfect. I do want season 7 and 8, but won't buy the whole set to get them.",1389657600,,316,3.953125

5939938,5,B00ESG5AD4,"Excellent. Dick Van Dyke is a wonderful actor and portray's Dr, Mark Sloan in a marvelously real to life manner.",1389744000,,112,4.65
8608888,4,B00ESG5AD4,"Season six part two is more of the same.  Dick Van Dyke is still finding any excuse to sing, dance, roller skate, and do card tricks.  Im not certain Id like a doctor who suddenly dances a jig for no reason at all.  Be that as it may, hes also solving crimes in his spare time.  This set offers a lot of variety.  Dr. Jesse (Charlie Schlatter) is stalked by a crazy patient.  Theres an episode about boxers and drugs.  An episode dealing with mercy killings.  They also waste an episode on the last pilot for a possible TV series that was never made, featuring all women cops and a novel way of encouraging organ donations.  What makes this especially amusing is that it was a terrible plot and several episodes prior they did a two-part episode dealing with Trash TV filled with dopey TV showsconcepts youd think no one in their right mind would make.  And then they made their own.",1517702400,,883,4.395061728395062
