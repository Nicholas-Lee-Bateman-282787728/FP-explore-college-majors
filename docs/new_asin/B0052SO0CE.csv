4530626,3,B0052SO0CE,"This is a documentary film-noire (that means heavy handed narration at points in the film) based on a novel titled CASE FILE FBI. Broderick Crawford (BORN YESTERDAY) is the main investigator, Detective Ripley, in this film . He loses his partner, Stewart, through part of the movie and takes on deceased's three cases in the hopes that one of them will lead him to the murderer. What follows is your typical film noir with some of the noir elements. They're somewhat good or lower in quality meaning good enough but nothing really jumps out so if you're a noir fan this is a good choice but if you're only going to watch a few in your life I'd check out the top twenty list. The climax takes place around the famous Hollywood Sign in Los Angeles. A big deal back then but overdone these days. I had a good laugh when they talked about how high tech the FBI was in solving crime. Remember, this film was made in 1954 and they're showing all these antiquated gadgets. My second laugh was after Crawford's character says about his partner: ""This was with his night with his kids, too."" It just felt corny but that's part of the fun in watching these old films. Notice the torpedo shaped bras on the women. They were the fashion back then! The starlet style blonde talked a bit too much to the detectives and was the most likely femme fatale element but you'll see more about this when you watch it. All the people rushing in front of a charging car at the climax was off but you have to watch it from the aerial view to catch that bit. A closing line that felt off at the very end: ""Sometimes you meet some nice people in this business."" And all I have to say to that as I roll my eyes is you sure do, fella, ya sure do. All said and criticisms aside it was a fun enough movie to watch while I was doing some brainless work. STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus to B minus; FILM NOIR ELEMENTS MET: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday (streamed); OVERALL GRADE: B minus.",1331769600,6,1984,4.364864864864865
4530627,4,B0052SO0CE,"United Artists presents ""DOWN THREE DARK STREETS"" (1954) (86 min/B&W) -- Starring: Broderick Crawford, Ruth Roman, Martha Hyer, Marisa Pavan & Kenneth Tobey

Directed by Arnold Laven

When FBI Agent Zack Stewart (Kenneth Tobey) is killed, Agent John `Rip' Ripley (Broderick Crawford) almost single-handedly takes over the three cases he was working on, hoping one will lead to his killer. The first involves gangster Joe Walpo (Joe Bassett) and Ripley finds his hideout through Joe's girl friend, Connie Anderson (Martha Hyer). The next involves a car-theft gang which Ripley breaks up by using one of the gang, Vince Angelino and his wife Julie (Gene Reynolds & Marisa Pavan). The last case involves Kate Martell (Ruth Roman), the victim of an extortionist who threatens to kidnap her child unless she pays him $10,000.

Co-adapted by Gordon & Mildred Gordon from their novel Case File FBI, Down Three Dark Streets (1954) is a tour-de-force for Broderick Crawford

* Special footnote: -- One of my favorite actors Kenneth Tobey, had a great role in The Thing from Another World (1951), as Captain Patrick Hendry the hero -- also from the early days of television Whirlybirds (1956-1959), playing Chuck Martin.

4530630,4,B0052SO0CE,"A unique post-World War II crime movie with the cops and FBI as the heroes fighting the mob. The ""good guys"" always win. Crawford delivers a command, if not, formulaic performance as the top cop. The film utilizes three different motifs with some interweaving themes and characters...a style that has been re-played of recent in numerous dramatic films that show disparate lives can mingle and relate to one another in unusual ways. The movie is worth viewing if you love seeing on-location shots of urban America of the early '50s and seeing how cops had a lot more leeway in catching and interrogating suspects.",1432944000,3,613,4.903846153846154

4530643,3,B0052SO0CE,"How many of these FBI propaganda films were made back in the '40s through the early '60s? This could have been a good mystery story if it had not been such a glorification of the FBI. The FBI could do no wrong. They could examine the smallest piece of evidence and gain unlimited information. If only the witnesses would cooperate, the FBI would solve every crime in a second.",1396310400,2,376,4.463768115942029
4530644,3,B0052SO0CE,"Good old crime flick with an emphasis on ""Who Done It"" and utilization of older type forensics.  The acting was not bad and there was some uncertainty as to who the ultimate bad guy was.",1396051200,3,186,4.314285714285714
4530645,4,B0052SO0CE,"Great casting and good story telling. You would think one of the three stories would be weak but all three hold up. Martha Hyer is terrific flirting with the cops and believable as the moll in love with the wrong guy. Marisa Paven walks the line between sympathy and sap and doesn't cross over. Ruth Roman is always terrific as a classy good-looking every woman. She does a good job portraying her hectic life and the strain she is under because of the blackmail attempt to get her insurance. There is enough thread to allow the story to build. And then there is the performance of Max Showalter (known for uttering his famous ""skuttle it!"" plea as the anguished husband in Niagara) who gets to play a very different type of role. Broderick Crawford is a cop it seems as he acts the cop role so smoothly.  And it is always a treat for me when one of these oldies works in the Hollywood sign as part of the drama. Worth a watch and the print quality is not bad. It does not skip or stall or have hideous sound problems.",1394409600,2,1018,4.329842931937173
4530646,4,B0052SO0CE,"Found out about this little 50's gem while watching an interview with one of the actors who, at that time was just getting established in the film and TV business.  The atransfer is crisp as is the sound. Looks like it might have been cleaned up, considering so many films of that era were loaded with imperfections.  If you're into crime and police dramas you might want to take a peek at this. The case jacket is OK, but somewhat scarce on information, and there are no embellishments. This is a film you get because you want to see the film and don't really care about the lack of extras, It's not as sophisticated as current dramas, but it's still a good flick and MGM did a good job on bringing it to DVD.",1384128000,6,710,4.291044776119403
4530647,4,B0052SO0CE,"When an FBI agent (Kenneth Tobey, THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD) is killed while investigating a case, the fellow agent (Broderick Crawford) who is assigned the three cases the murdered agent was working on attempts to discover which of the three cases involves his killer. All three cases involve three women: single mother Ruth Roman is being extorted for her late husband's insurance money, good time gal Martha Hyer is protecting the whereabouts of her homicidal lover (Joe Bassett), blind Marisa Pavan's husband (Gene Reynolds) is sent to prison for refusing to talk about a car theft ring. This is a modest but very well made gripping noir-ish thriller shot faux documentary style (by Joseph Biroc, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE) on the streets of L.A. The screenplay is by Mildred and Gordon Gordon (sic) based on their novel CASE FILE: FBI and the similarities to their later screenplay for EXPERIMENT IN TERROR are quite evident. While perhaps not as stylish as the later Blake Edwards film, this is a solid recommended effort. Directed by Arnold Laven. With Claude Akins, Jay Adler, Casey Adams and William Schallert.

The MGM MOD DVD is very nice looking B&W full frame transfer.",1345766400,13,1181,4.9646464646464645
8454189,5,B0052SO0CE,"This great little B movie from ClassicFlix is a fine example that big budgets and CGI are not essential to get an audience hooked. Basically a chase film, the climax under the Hollywood sign is a total knockout. You don't have to be a film noir addict to enjoy this toughie.",1527552000,,274,4.392156862745098
8454190,5,B0052SO0CE,very very happy great classic,1525737600,,29,5.0
8454191,4,B0052SO0CE,"Broderick Crawford made quite a career for himself as a character actor following in the footsteps of his mother, Helen Broderick, the frequent pal or aunt to Ginger Rogers in her Fred Astaire films.  Crawford effectively used his not-handsome looks to project everday-guy existence and excelled in strong, arrogant and powerful roles such as in ""All the King's Men.""

Ruth Roman, coming from a super-poor background in Boston, made this film about three years after her career-building turn in Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train.""  With appropriate intensity, she seems able to prove what many believe, that brunettes have better chances than blondes of obtaining good, meaty roles in Hollywood.

Both leads are very effective, he as a tough detective and she as a frightened woman threatened with harm to her and/or her child.  In a supporting role Martha Hyer, generally a good actress, seems to stumble into the frequent pitfall of the time:  approaching the role of a sexy, forward woman by using an obvious imitation of Marilyn Monroe's voice and mannerisms as her cornerstone tools.

This 1954 movie is very well realized and worth the investment in viewing time.",1482192000,,1169,5.121052631578947
