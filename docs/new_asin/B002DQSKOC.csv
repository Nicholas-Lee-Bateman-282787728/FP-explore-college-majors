3912564,1,B002DQSKOC,What a load of manure. This is bad. Where did they dig up these people from. The female in the beginning was the most scary thing about the movie. Why do people make crap like this. Why does Amazon accept it? NF is looking better all the time.,1372204800,7,243,4.083333333333333
3912565,1,B002DQSKOC,This is the most amateur flick I've ever seen. Horrible story line. Awful make up and special effects. High school kids could have done better.,1369785600,5,143,4.76
3912566,3,B002DQSKOC,"Some very funny parts in this movie, like the deputy trying to put his intestines back in, and the gouge in the girls leg that hardly affects her, and the near the end when the guy pulls his head apart. They could have made this more interesting with some more intense sexual content. As a horror movie, this one doesn't even come close.",1366416000,,337,4.365079365079365

3912568,1,B002DQSKOC,"In a few words, this movie takes way to long to take off. CONTAGIO is boring, slow paced and when the action starts, it's rather dull. The special FX are ok to good but that is the only redeeming quality this movie has besides the cool DVD art. There is not one likeable character in the movie that you can really attach yourself to, no chemistry between them at all, I felt no sympathy for any of them. The acting is very low grade and some of the camera work is shoddy. There could not have been ANY color correction on this film because some of the scenes were blown out and appear colorless. It's a story that's been told over and over again. I'm glad I only paid 99 cents for this movie. Sorry, but I can not recommend CONTAGIO for a good time.

3912569,2,B002DQSKOC,"I only watched six minutes of this though I paid for it. On Demand features I buy from Amazon usually look wonderful but at full screen this one looked very low res and had lots of ghosts and artifacts, especially around the people. I don't think it is an issue with the streaming, I think it was filmed that way. The six minutes I watched included seeing water drops and also reflections on the camera lens itself. At the six minute mark, where I stopped watching, the filmmaker has the viewer watch a man urinating. That was enough for me. If you do plan on watching it in a little window instead of full screen. I felt were I to watch the whole thing full screen I'd have a headache and the little window is not my style. Good luck!",1284163200,3,735,4.257142857142857
3912570,3,B002DQSKOC,"Contagio is, with the bottom line, a low budget movie.  Really. It's a simple story that would rank along John Borman's ""Deliverance"" or Ethan Coen's ""No Country for Old Men"" if the director and writer Steve Sessions had a proper budget. The plot has simple everyday locations that the characters move around in like these. While vacationing in the woods, Calvin and Iris find their lives in danger after a government satellite, without warning, crashes near their campsite and releases a deadly cloud of gas-not a rocket fuel as the officials say, but some form of biological weapon. The ""cloud"" has spread over a wide area, killing animals and people. The ensuing cover up and attempted ""cleanup"" of undesirables-folks who know the truth-is the focus of our story as not only do they dodge biosuited soldiers, gunship helicopters and ""cleanse"" bombing stealth fighters, but the deadly contamination as well. The resulting end would be a staple of any Romero ""Dead"" feature if I have ever seen one, but there are no spoilers here!

The director lets the story unfold kind of slowly, and the difficulties of dealing with the ultra low budget is obvious with the camera work. Contagio was shot on video. The gas victims and broken leg makeup is top, and the suspense is not bad. But hand held camera shots only seem to work with some features, like Blair Witch or Battlestar Galactica, so it seems to pull against the film here. Contagio was shot in one week. How does it fare? The biohazard troopers are realistic. The actors are from the director's past features staples, or have experience in other low budget horror and science fiction SOV features and once again, it has a very low budget.  So gauge it as it is.  If you are looking for a Hollywood 40 million dollar epic here look elsewhere. These types of low budget shoots are targeted for a niche clientele that Brain Damage Films, the distributor, has tailored to exclusively to allow low budget film makers to release their works. Session's Contagio premise is dark, suspenseful, and could have been a major piece had Steve Sessions, really, had a real budget. But like most movie doers, he works with what he has-and it comes out entertaining.

Some of the director's past works-all available internationally-Cremains, Hellbound, Malefic, Dead Clowns, Southern Gothic, At The House of Madness and Torment, all demonstrate his horror writing and film making talents if more money were spent on production. Lionsgate distributed one. Some have even been on cable! Contagio is a break in a new direction, and although the concept is interesting, the director should stick to what he really does best-in my opinion-supernatural horror. I have to respect the talents and pains of low budget directors who get the product done rather than mulling over doing nothing at all. Considering the odds and thousands of no budget productions that are produced monthly and never get distribution I have to say his B,C,D,F,W,X and Z grade movies have done him pretty well. His site is b-horror.com. Sure, folks, I'm a big fan of Steve Sessions. But I'll tell it how it is. So enough said. Someone give this man a proper budget!",1269388800,4,3172,4.877551020408164
3912571,2,B002DQSKOC,"Pretty awful, but had some (unintentionally) funny spots. Especially after the anorexic female lead slashes the infected deputy with a machette and he struggles for what seems like fifteen minutes to stuff his entrails back in his belly. But when he pushes one side in the other tumbles out. Poor guy, trying so hard. Finally, his guts, which now look like a string of bloody sausages, fall to ground and he gives up and dies. In an earlier scene Iris falls into a hole and the camera closeups her wound which seems to be a huge chunk of missing flesh revealing her tibia which appears broken since her booted foot moves independent of the leg. However, she is not bleeding, not does she seem to be in any serious pain, and make a near full recovery in a matter of minutes. It is very gory in some spots, but it is so poorly done it is hardly upsetting. Miss it is you can.",1444608000,,873,4.361963190184049

3912577,1,B002DQSKOC,"What do you,get when you have only money enough for a special effects make up man.  You get no acting, no writing, no direction, and the most hilarious movie to skim through. Someone knew enough to make a leg look like it had a five inch long , three inch wide avulsion to the bone and along the side of the tibia.  However, the girl doesn't scream once and only whimpers in pain and holds her fists to her mouth.  Once covered lightly with gauze, it stops bleeding. She can hobble along and by the end of the day she is able to walk alone.  Another good effect was a man (kinda zombified), sliced opened with a machete, pulling out his intestines and wringing his hands with them for a good five minutes. Then he dies.  And his face collapses.  As do everyone else who is infected.  Except the hero, Calvin, who rips his own head in half.  This apparently all takes place in a Canadian province park.  There are scenes of a helicopter chasing them and with a soldier's shooting at them.  However they're in a forest and he is shooting into rice fields.  A person is hit by a car and splits in half.  To watch this you must  fast forward and stop for a minute at a time or else you will fall asleep.  They must have had poor sound equipment because everyone had to speak in a monotone.  It's amazing hearing people screaming in a monotone.  There is also a wonderful scene of a flock of dead birds with collapsed heads and no beaks.  Apparently only humans and a specific breed of black birds were affected y this 'Contagio'.",1414022400,2,1525,4.332155477031802
3912578,1,B002DQSKOC,This movie was horrible!  The acting was bad and it was produced and directed very badly. This is the worst movie I have seen in a very long time and I like 'B' movies.  This movie was a F.,1410393600,,189,3.8205128205128207

3912581,1,B002DQSKOC,"As a zombie movie fan - I can take a lot of crappy acting.  I can take cheap movies.  But what I cannot take - is the total lack of any plausible plot, horrible lighting, horrible acting.

The girl that is featured in the first 20 minutes is not even that hot.  The only reason I kept watching is you get to see her topless.  Other than that - I turned the movie off after 20 minutes.  Its utterly terrible.",1403481600,2,407,4.025
3912582,1,B002DQSKOC,"You know how some movies start out really slowly and then grab you by the throat at some point?  Unfortunately, this isn't one of those movies.  Contagio starts with a whole lot of nothing happening and retains its torturously slow pace throughout 93 of the longest minutes you will ever spend in your life.  I was amazed to learn that the filming took place in Mississippi (six days of shooting in all)  not only does this have the look and feel of a bad foreign horror film, the two stars of the show cannot possibly speak English as their first language, routinely emphasizing the wrong syllables of words.  Oh, but the fight scenes, such as they are, are a real sight to behold.  Its as if the filmmakers wanted to film the fight scenes in slow motion but couldn't afford the equipment to do so  so they just told the actors to pretend to perform in slow motion.  Apparently, they couldn't afford a fight choreographer, either, because the lead actress also serves in that role.

If you get off on watching people walk aimlessly through the woods, this is your movie.  All we learn about the main characters is that they are a couple who have embarked on a camping vacation in some nameless national forest.  After far too much walking, they finally pitch a tent, do what young couples alone in the woods tend to do, and then shuffle off the next morning to meet their destiny.  That involves a hole, a crashed satellite, a dark cloud of something that does very bad things to the human body, and government goons in Hazmat suits who arrive on scene to make sure the truth about what has happened never has a chance to get out.

I love blood and gore as much as any horror fan on Earth, but Im not overly fond of using excessive gore as a crutch to make up for bad writing, bad acting, bad cinematography, etc.  There aren't that many gory scenes in Contagio, but every one of them is excessively gory  usually in a pretty obviously fake way.  OK, Ill admit I did enjoy watching what has to be the longest scene in cinema history of some poor bloke trying to keep his insides from falling out, but the rest of it really didn't do it for me  largely because I knew the filmmakers were relying on the gore just to sell the film.  Mind-numbingly boring with scattered moments of excessive gore  thats Contagio in a nutshell.",1401408000,4,2325,4.453900709219858
3912583,3,B002DQSKOC,"I'm a fan of disaster movies, and while there is an element of that in this film it was done in more of a ""documentary"" style.  The movie is okay, but not at all what I expected.  If  I'd known beforehand, I would not have paid the original high price for this film, but might consider it if the price were about half or less.",1401062400,,326,3.9846153846153847

This movie gave me more than a few good laughs.  From the 3ft deep ""hole of no return"", to the stock footage of a Blackhawk helicopter (over what appears to be opium fields in Afghanistan) as it chases our fearless duo in their Honda Civic, this movie is pure cheese.
