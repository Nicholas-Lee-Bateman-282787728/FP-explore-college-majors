7788176,5,0679884815,We love Arthur. Marc Brown never ceases to amaze me and my family with his choice of topics for Arthur's adventures. Such well written stories with good morals. Kids's of all ages seem to relate to the stories. We have been reading them since my daughter was 2 1/2.,1361577600,,265,4.428571428571429
7788177,4,0679884815,"Arthur had to write a story in a report,fiction,or something that happened in his life. He wanted to write about getting Pal,(see my review on Arthur's New Puppy)but D.W said it was too boring. She suggested to write a fiction story on how he got an elephant,but Arthur wanted everyone to love it,but Buster said it was only OK.So he wrote about getting an elephant on space,and other really crazy things. A fine recomendation.",975283200,,427,4.783783783783784
