8280842,5,B001B0LZ7A,"Unfortunately this DVD does not provide subtitles, so you have to understand the French language well to follow the story of 'Elle cause ...'. Which is a pity, for 'Elle cause ...' surely deserves a much wider public than only those who understand French.

What we have here is a fine light comedy that goes like a whirlwind. Like only the French can produce. Dating from 1970, and shot with the best technics of its time. Extra flavor is added by the bright-colored fashion current back then. The greatest contribution, however, is made by its cast: Annie Girardot, Bernard Blier and Mireille Darc.
