7929649,4,B0000520PY,"This is a low-budget, 'on location' action-adventure from the 60's starring and directed by George Montgomery. Since it was shot in widescreen and color and this early 80's VHS version is barely panned/scanned and rather washed out, I can't say we're getting a very good version of this title. However, it's not a great movie so a new upgrade would seem pointless. Arrived on time.",1393718400,,381,4.876923076923077
