7891200,3,6305523010,"First off, this is not a sequel to Caligula. It was filmed a few years before Tinto Brass made Caligula. Caligula II aka Messalina,Messalina aka Empress of Love is a low budget comedy set in Imperial Rome. The entire  movie is a sex farce. You get lots of nudity, sex, beautiful women and a  really gory finale that will bring a smile to your face. The entire plot of  the film centers around the Emperor Claudius' wife, Messalina. Apparently  Messalina can't get enough action from her husband so she takes on what  seems like most of Rome. I can't stress enough the silliness of the ensuing  film. One of the funniest scenes is when Messalina actually affects a Mae  West accent! I'm not joking! Anneka Di Lorenzo, who plays Messalina, is a  total babe. I had to give this film three stars due to the horrible audio  track, which makes hearing the dialogue tough. The print is rather faded  and hazy, too. Unfortunately all versions of this film are pretty foggy. If  you want a movie you can laugh, groan and roll your eyes at, and whistle at  the beautiful women, pick up Messalina, Messalina today.",949017600,27,1103,4.571428571428571
