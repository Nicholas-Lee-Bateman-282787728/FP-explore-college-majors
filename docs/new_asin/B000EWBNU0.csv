8115121,2,B000EWBNU0,"While a well-filmed documentary with lots of good penguin footage, it can't go 5 or 6 minutes without showing ample blood and gore, making it a less-than-ideal gift for a penguin-lover. We know penguins have it rough, but that can easily be conveyed through narration rather than (repeatedly) showing them dying horrible deaths. Overall, a depressing film.",1324857600,,356,5.2631578947368425
8115122,3,B000EWBNU0,"I'm far from a prude but there's very little here in depth about any of the many penguin species covered, and far too much death. It's dificult to go 5 minutes without seeing a penguin faceplant into the side of a cliff, get swung around from the jaws of a seal or get picked apart by sea birds. The camera lingered a bit too long on the frozen baby penguin graveyard at the end of the film. Yes, death is a perfectly natural part of life, and I'm perfectly okay with it, but this documentary's billing on the back of the jacket as ""Perfect for the whole family"" should be taken with a grain of salt. All that I'm saying is that I wouldn't show this to my four year old neice, and I almost sent it to her for Christmas this year, but I had the good sense to screen it.",1324166400,,768,4.059210526315789
