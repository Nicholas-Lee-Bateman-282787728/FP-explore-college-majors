2405165,5,B000B7QCFE,"I love doing Gilad videos and my sister loves Billy Blank's Bootcamp, and I found something that we both will love! I really like how Shpresa does the workout in 30 minutes, so if you don't have a lot of time to spare, you can still do this workout and get the full benefits. Plus, and this is one of my most favorite parts: she shows you how to do the move before she starts her sets. It is perfect for beginners or advanced people because she has different people for you to follow based on your skill level, always the to move to the next level. The video is set up into six sections and each one ends with a nice stretch. The music is really inspiring, also. On the special features part of the DVD you can meet Shpresa and get to know her philosophy in one of her video interviews, plus there are video testimonials to watch, too. All in all I was very pleased with this workout and I am definitely going to incorporate it into my schedule.",1152576000,11,945,4.197802197802198
8082970,5,B000B7QCFE,"I think this DVD is great.  You can complete the entire DVD in less than an hour or you can break it up and do the warm-up and choice a specific workout (arms, buns and thighs, or abs).  I also believe the workouts are very effective.  I have already noticed a difference in how my clothes fit.",1484870400,,294,4.12280701754386
8082971,2,B000B7QCFE,"Pros
Good cues
Modifier

Cons
She tries to cram several moves into thirty minutes which doesnt allow for a good burn
She keeps marching during upper body to make it cardio but it took away from each movement as opposed to adding to it
She double pumped on the rotator exercise. I didn't feel it was safe so i didn't double time there
I didn't sweat
She spent one minute on the cool down
I don't like my stretches rushed especially after a workout

She talks throughout guiding u with maybe more cues than necessary but i didn't mind

I liked the ab segment but again rushed. I would have loved more time on the plank

Definitively a beginner work out no challenges here",1453593600,,669,4.370967741935484
8082972,4,B000B7QCFE,Just received and haven't had time to view this video.,1430179200,,54,4.5
8082973,5,B000B7QCFE,"These workouts are great for all levels...
The exercises incorporate more than one muscle group per move, which can burn more fat in a shorter time.
This is great home exercise program...
Lots of my friends have seen results quickly...
Enjoy!",1396310400,,242,4.926829268292683
8082974,1,B000B7QCFE,"I have a large collection of workout videos, and I wish I had rented this one before I purchased it. The cueing is poor, and the ""workout"" is almost laughable - except that as a beginner you might hurt yourself because of poor form. Pass on this one, particularly if you are used to professional productions by Beachbody and The Biggest Loser.",1390521600,,343,4.548387096774194
8082975,5,B000B7QCFE,"I really like Shpresa's (I can't spell it) style. It is diffrent to anything I have come across, and it is always nice to try somehting new and fresh. The moves are easy to follow and the addition of hand weights really helps with the burn. Overall though, for me, this workout was not one of the most challening I have done, but still very effective and fun. I recommend it.",1280448000,,375,4.295774647887324
8082976,2,B000B7QCFE,"I found this workout difficult to follow.  I have many workout DVDs, and haven't encountered this before; I believe it is due to poor cueing.

I don't find it to actually be a total-body workout.  It does not excercise the upper or lower back.

Not terribly impressed with the music.

There are better choices out there.  ""Strong Body, Ageless Body"" is far more comprehensive, better cue-ed, and more effective.

Having tried this once, it's unlikely I will try it again.",1218412800,3,471,4.8125
8082977,3,B000B7QCFE,"I was originally disappointed with this workout DVD because of two things: the length and the workout itself. The bow says it has a run time of about 40 some minutes but in reality, after credits and the beginning intro, it's only a 25 minute workout. And it really doesn't make you work very hard.
But, after using it a few times, I has come in handy when I don't have a lot of time and when I just want a good ab workout. It's not very good cardio but does a lot of toning.",1203552000,,475,4.010526315789473
8082978,5,B000B7QCFE,"This video is almost a perfect workout for me! It is 30 min which is perfect because I get bored easily and Shpresa really works everything into that 30 min.  You get a good warm up, lower & upper body toning, and then abs with a nice cool down.  I always have a good strain the next day after doing it.  I highly recommend this one and I can't wait to try the lower body one!",1193011200,,376,3.9210526315789473
8082979,5,B000B7QCFE,"Honestly, this workout is harder than it looks even though you're only working out for 30 minutes.  The warm up seems almost too easy, but then you start doing the weights.  I have 4 pound weights and my arms were dying just trying to hold them up over my head after doing rep after rep after rep. Same with the leg and ab work out.  Shake up your routine using this workout video with other forms of aerobics, you'll see a stark difference in a month.  And Shpresa (sounds like a soft drink) has a nice throaty husky voice, not that helium squeal most aerobic instructors seem to have.

Definitely recommend it.",1167868800,10,612,4.428571428571429
