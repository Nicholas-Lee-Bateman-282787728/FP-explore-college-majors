233334,5,6300213579,Season Three is one of the most underrated seasons of all of Star Trek. I personally find it much better than the Second Season. Jerome Bixby is one of my favorite Star Trek writers. Every episode he wrote was good. I highly recommend this episode. I don't want to give too much away but the ending excellent because it showed Humans and Klingons working together.

Granted they have transporters and warp speed capability, but isn't this stretching things a bit too far?  Like Tomorrow Is Yesterday, D. C. Fontana wrote a very bad ending.

233338,5,6300213579,"There's often been hints of drug culture in Sci-Fi series from the 60's and 70's (especially in Space 1999), and this is one of the most obviously ""trippy"" episodes of Star Trek.

The Enterprise crew lands on a strange planet that is very peaceful, and where everybody seems healthy. The reason for this is the spores of a plant that proliferates under the effects of a normally lethal ray. Under the influence of the spore, humans lose their ambitions and their sense of duty and responsibility. In short, they become happy.

The colony on that planet is basically a hippie community: it is a humorous fact that animals for some reason all died on the planet and the humans all turned vegetarian! The planet is neon-green and looks like a typical tie-dye t-shirt! The plant spits its spores like confetti! Peace and love reigns supreme and makes people improvise bad poetry!

Is that all such a bad thing? Is the path of progress over stagnation always the right one? What would you choose:  a carefree life or one where one must pursue his/her ambitions, never satisfied, always frustrated? This episode opts for the latter, but thankfully it doesn't preach too hard against the former.",1238544000,2,1188,4.8088235294117645
233339,5,6300213579,"this episode is not some simple silly trek making fun of the youth. yes, it's a social commentary, but not just of the counter-cultural movement. it's a commentary on cultist religious movements, of the stifling crush of society, of our society's....well, of our technological...whatever it is we do. Humans like to play God, and that's what the Federation was doing, and that's what the idealists had a problem with. the youth are not villanized, as some reviewers suggest. it is as much a criticism of Starfleet as the idealists. that Sevrin mislead the people is only tragic, because the idealists, in many ways, were correct (at least, in my opinion).

the music is also fantastic. great stuff. I love this episode, for its relevance, its plot, its great singing, and...hell, it's just all around wonderful.",1227830400,2,811,5.007407407407407
233340,5,6300213579,"This episode to me is interesting if just for one important fact. The script was written by the extremely talented puppeteer, Shari Lewis along with her husband.  With her famous puppets Lamb Chop and Charlie Horse, she raised a generation of American children with her Saturday morning television show.
It is not an expected project from so talented an entertainer, and says much for the daring of Star Trek's producer in those early seasons.  Star Trek was always about pushing the limits of television subject matter.  This is just one more example.  Don't criticize the episode without doing a search for Shari Lewis and her famous ""critters"".  Dr. J. P. Schwartz",1202947200,,667,4.972972972972973
233341,4,6300213579,"Computers are useful for doing boring things like adding up columns of numbers. But would anyone in their right mind want to give computers the GLAMOROUS jobs? Writing novels, composing hit songs... or commanding a starship? As McCoy points out in this episode, having computers replace people is okay as long as they don't come after YOUR job. For Capt. Kirk the prospect of being replaced by a computer is especially horrifying.

Kirk has the ""honor"" of trying out the spanking new M-5 computer (think of HAL on steroids), meaning he must periodically give up control to M-5. But it's a dubious honor from the beginning, and when Capt Wesley gives Kirk the backhanded compliment of being ""Captain Dunsel,"" it's downright insulting. No wonder M-5 later tries to destroy Wesley's attack force. Maybe it was trying to exact revenge for all the insults heaped on Kirk! Our sympathies are always with Kirk and never for a moment with M-5 and its inventor, Dr. Daystrom.

For all its reputed intelligence, M-5 is ultimately very stupid because it is unable to understand the simple concept of war games and decides to destroy a bunch of ships for real. That's an acceptable premise only if you regard AI (Artifical Intelligence) as unreliable. Beyond that, handing over decisions about who lives and who dies to a machine ought to be obviously unacceptable even in the 23rd Century.

The episode has a marvelous moment when Spock -- whom Bones accuses of being in love with the new computer -- finally shows his true colors, saying that a starship runs ""on loyalty... to a man."" (As Kirk ironically says in Star Trek II, Spock was ""the most human."") Lovely also is the casting of William Marshall as the half-mad genius Dr. Daystrom. In the 21st century, we wouldn't bother to mention that a black man played a genius with a super-high IQ, thank God. But in the 1960s this made a strong statement. The casting of Marshall was color-blind, taking advantage of his strong presence and marvelous bass voice (much like casting James Earl Jones as Darth Vader). Too bad that he's about a foot and a half taller than Shatner, so that Kirk is forever looking up. That might actually be astute casting, though, as the intent is to make Kirk feel small and unimportant for most of the episode.",1200960000,,2280,4.767088607594936
233342,5,6300213579,"This episode is definitley one for the record books!

Janice Lester, Kirk's former lover seeks revenge by forcing him into a machine that trades bodies. Janice Lester is Kirk and Kirk is Janice Lester.

Definetely, there's nothing new about that idea! Comedies have been using the idea of one character becoming another character through a brain transplant for years. The difference here is that you're supposed to know that Janice is Kirk because Janice acts rational, and you're supposed to know that Kirk is Janice because he acts like a nut case.. and also, Star Trek is not a comedy.

A warning to any film producer: NEVER make an episode like this in this day and age! The lawsuits will be pouring in from BOTH political extremes. Woman's groups will sue over the film's idea that a woman in command is too irrational. Religious groups will sue because of the idea of a man and a woman trading bodies. There wouldn't be an activist group left that wouldn't sue.

On the other hand, the fact that this episode crosses so many boundaries is what makes it one of the best ST episodes ever made. The director wasn't afraid to take a risk.

Of all things, Shatner has to act like an irrational woman. Even little mannerisms have to be effeminate. The bad temper he is supposed to have can't be just an ordinary temper. It has to mirror a woman's temper. This requires acting ability that is second to none. Shatner deserves a star  on the Hollywood walk of fame for this role...if those people in white coats don't haul him off the stage in a straight jacket first.",1197676800,,1566,4.594982078853047
233413,4,6300213579,"Of all the episodes in the original series, this is the one in which the Enterprise acts most aggressively against an alien species that is arguably intelligent. But it's justified by how hostile and sadistic these particular aliens are. This is the one with the flying jellyfish who stick to your back and then cause you incredible pain if you don't do what they want. Though individually not intelligent, they collectively operate as neurons of a single ""brain."" They make the Borg and the Klingons look sweet-natured by comparison.

What lifts this episode above a 3-star rating is the dramatic tension and large number of moral dilemmas, impressive even by Star Trek standards. 1) Should Spock be allowed to resume his post, even though the ""things"" are trying to control him? 2) Should Spock be used as a guinea pig, even though the test may cause permanent blindness? 3) Above all, is it better to kill a few million people (an act of commission) or let billions of others die (an act of omission)?

Y'see, the only way to kill the evil jellyfish is to kill everyone on the planet below. If this isn't done, then the flying jellyfish will someday spread to other, more populous planets, where they will torture and enslave billions of people. Spock says killing the population is the only logical thing to do. (The needs of the many vs. the needs of the comparatively few.) Bones says, No, no, Jim, it's not the human thing to do. Kirk shows both his strong will and his humanity by saying, ""Gentlemen, both alternatives are unacceptable. Find me another solution."" In this way, Kirk is much like Pres. Kennedy in the Cuban Missile Crisis, unwilling to accept either defeat or nuclear war. JFK also demanded a third option. Kirk has much in common with JFK.

And yet this episode -- a scary ""kill the evil aliens before they get us"" story -- is not everyone's cup of tea, which is why I can't quite give it 5 stars.",1188172800,,1921,4.644117647058824
233414,4,6300213579,"This used to be one of my fave episodes, but I didn't enjoy it as much when I viewed it recently (first time in 20 years). Maybe age makes one a curmudgeon.

Crewmembers beam down to yet another Eden-like planet (for a change they don't mention Eden this time) in which any dangerous things they think about mysteriously show up: a tiger, a jousting knight, a rapist dressed as Don Juan, whatever. The Caretaker of the planet finally appears and tells them if they just exercise self control, they can have a jolly old time... because they can conjure up good things also. They need only control their thoughts. That's all there is to the episode. Really!

It's consistent with a running theme in classic Trek that truly advanced aliens have no inherent need to torment or hunt human beings, that such advanced beings should have evolved ethically as well as technologically. Conflict derives here (as it does elsewhere) from misunderstanding.

In a weird sort of way, the premise of this episode anticipates bestsellers like ""The Secret"" by several decades. Anything you focus on long enough, you get. Only on this planet it happens much faster... because the aliens monitor everyone's thoughts and then manufacture the object of those thoughts, whether it be Alice in Wonderland (McCoy) or a Samurai (Sulu). And of course the aliens can manufacture members of the opposite sex, anatomically correct to the last detail, wink wink nudge nudge.

Admittedly, it's a clever, whimsical idea from legendary writer Theodore Sturgeon (along with Harlan Ellison, the most famous ST writer outside of ST itself). The reason I have to mark it down to 4 stars is that the ""Kirk in love"" scenes -- this time with an old flame named Ruth -- are especially cringe-inducing. ""Don't you like birds, Mr. Stiles?"" he intones like a dopy teenager... or Hayden Christiansen in Attack of the Clones. It's too bad, because Shatner is otherwise fine... and ""Kirk in love"" does work in some episodes (namely The City on the Edge of Forever).",1184716800,,2017,4.871720116618076
233415,5,6300213579,"Which is better: to live a life of perfect happiness but no accomplishment? Or to live a life of achievement and progress yet never feeling content? This is one of the major questions of life. ""This Side of Paradise"" deals with it directly. An Earth colony has been zapped by a bunch of spores, which sustain life and induce blissful contentment in their hosts, but at a price. The spores take away all ambition, drive, and sense of duty.

You can imagine how, when the Enterprise visits the planet, the spores change Mr. Spock, who at first fights them. But he finally gives in. In his case, they let his human side, for the first time in his life, reign supreme, enabling him to return the love of a beautiful woman (Jill Ireland) who has adored him from afar. It is Kirk, not Spock, who finally overcomes the spores. This is a running theme in the series... Spock is superior to Kirk in many ways: intellectually, physically, spiritually. But it is Kirk's unconquerable will that makes him the leader of the Enterprise.

This episode is outstanding because of the subtle touches in DC Fontana's script and the marvelous way it is acted. Anyone who thinks Shatner is incapable of convincing acting should look at the scene in which Kirk says to the spore-influenced Spock, ""Are you out of your mind?"" while Spock hangs from a tree like a monkey.

But it is the last half that is more than worth the price of admission. First, the scene where Kirk drives the spores' influence out of Spock by calling him a ""freak"" and insulting his parents. (Y'see, strong negative emotions overcome the spores.) This is followed up later by perhaps the best-written scene in the entire Star Trek franchise: Spock explaining to Leila that he cannot go back. ""If there are self-made purgatories, then we all have to live in them. Mine can be no worse than anyone else's.""

The scene ends with the following exchange:

LEILA: (Weeping.) You never told me if you had another name, Mr. Spock.

SPOCK: (Pause. Touches her cheek.) You couldn't pronounce it.

Then there is the final line of the show. As they prepare to warp out, Kirk asks Spock what he has to say about their adventure. Spock responds that he has nothing to say, except: ""For the first time in my life, I was happy.""",1183161600,2,2263,4.614427860696518
233416,3,6300213579,"Want to see ""Star Trek the Musical""? Wait no more! ""The Way to Eden"" has singing and dancing hippies right out of Haight Ashbury of the 1960s, doing super-groovy pseudo rock and roll. Or is it pseudo folk? Spock joins them in a jam session. Spock it to me!

The embarrssment reaches warp factor 9 as the music is pumped through the ship's speakers, and the crew starts swaying and snapping their fingers to show how hip they are. This enables one of the hippies (named ""Rad"" -- get it?) to sneak up behind people and take over the ship.

You may wonder who was taking drugs when they produced this episode, which unintentionally satirizes the 60s. Every cliche of the Youth Movement is used. One of the young people -- Irina, a Russian beauty who went to school with Checkov -- dropped out of Starfleet Academy. There's another, Rad, the rebellious son of a powerful man. There's the cheeky lead singer named Adam (rather obvious, given the Eden theme) played by Charles Napier. ""Gonna crack my knuckles and jump for joy / I gotta clean bill of health from Doctor McCoy!""  Then there's their guru, Dr. Severin, who inspires them all to drop out and groove.

There is the germ of a good idea here. The hippies call themselves ""the Primitives,"" and they seek a way of life free of the artificial atmostphere and life support that dominate every planet in the 23rd century. This artifical environment even breeds new viruses. This is a good sci-fi premise, giving Star Trek an ecological bent it needed. The environment may not be so wonderful by the 23rd century if we are not careful.

Another theme is the cult leader gone mad, which turned out to be prophetic. Under the influence of their insane leader, Dr. Severin, the hippies steal a spacecraft. As in ""Mudd's Women,"" Kirk orders the Enterprise to give chase and so becomes the hated authority figure. (Kirk, usually a beacon of enlightenment, is relegated to the unrewarding role of The Man, and the hippies label him ""Herbert,"" another word for ""square"" or possibly ""jerk."") Later, the hippies go along with Severin's plan to kill everyone on the Enterprise so that they can travel unhindered down to their ideal planet, ""Eden."" Severin's plan to have 400+ people die, and his ability to get otherwise well-meaning young people to go along with it, recalls no one so much as Charles Manson.",1183075200,2,2347,4.700729927007299
233417,4,6300213579,"Those who rate this as a subpar Trek episode may I say -Poppycock !

233418,4,6300213579,"This final STAR TREK episode carries the crude, macho sexism of the classic series to an all-but-apocalyptic extreme. A weak, jealous woman, unable to accept the fact that men are ""naturally"" superior to women, uses an ancient alien mind transfer machine to ""take over"" the body of Captain James T. Kirk!

The moral couldn't be more obvious -- even in Kirk's body, Doctor Janice Lester is weak, unstable, and in short still inferior. Kirk's loyal crew(his ""boys"")quickly guess the truth and turn on the sissified, effeminate captain (a little gay bashing thrown in with the sexism)while restoring the ""true"" captain to his rightful body. The whole thing would be really offensive if it weren't such classic camp.

Ironically enough, the concept of ""Kirk in a woman's body"" could very easily have been spun the other way. Imagine Jim Kirk experiencing the humiliations of being trapped in a woman's body first hand! Next time you watch the episode, watch the scenes were the actress (with ""Kirk"" inside her) is trapped in a cell with Bones, Scotty, and the gang. Imagine Scotty drooling over the ""woman"" and copping a feel! Imagine Kirk inside the woman, feeling humiliated and demeaned, and thinking, ""gee, is this what I did to all those girls?"" It could have been explosive -- it could have been BLACK LIKE ME for feminists! Or imagine a couple of those red-shirted guards making a pass at ""Kirk"" in a woman's body -- how would ""he"" respond? Would he say, ""Mister, you're out of line -- but I was a pig just like you once, so we'll let it pass.""

Initially the M-5 performs well, but when it decides to destroy a robot freighter, Kirk orders the test cancelled. The M-5, however, protects itself and makes it impossible for it to be disconnected. The computer becomes increasingly erratic, a result of Dr. Daystrom's decision to impress his engram onto the computer as part of its programming. Starting a scheduled war games drill, M-5 uses the full arsenal of the U.S.S. Enterprise to attack four other Federation starships.
In a last-ditch appeal to the M-5, Kirk makes the computer realize that it has committed the sin of murder for killing the crew of the U.S.S. Excalibur. Since Dr. Daystrom would be ethically abhorred at such an act, the M-5 is equally penitent and tries to commit suicide by leaving the U.S.S.

Chekov finds a lost love from the academy that joined this group.  Wish that the powers that be gave him more lines to tell us what he did in his academy years. I am surprised that Kirk dismissed their culture so quickly. The Federation is supposed to be so tolerant of other planets and people.  It's another case where paradise was not ment for mankind.  All in all I'd have to rate this a five out of five stars for seeing Spock jamming (playing his Vulcan harp) with the beatnics from outer space.,1029542400,2,830,4.4144736842105265
233466,3,6300213579,"The last episode of Star Trek.  And what a sour note to go out on.  It does not portray the ambitions of Janice Lester in a positive light.  We know she doesn't have the temperament to be a captain. The writers seem to think a woman commander is out of the question.  You might notice that there were no women Captains in the original series.
Well, in this one a jealous Lester switches bodies with Captain Kirk.  When the crew notice he's acting strangely they attempt to remove him from command.  While it was implausible at best; it was fun to see the revolt against Kirk. Something the actors might have wanted to do in real life.

233467,3,6300213579,"In this, the 79th, and concluding, episode of the Classic Star Trek series, Kirk is forced into transferring personalities with Janice Lester, a woman who has always dreamed of being a Starship Captain, but could not make the grade.
And it's easy to see why the grade was never made.  Lester is very petty and cruel, and cannot handle the reins of power at all.  It doesn't take long for the crew to realize that something is very wrong with their Captain and fight to take the ship back.
But the most awful part of this episode is the acting.  Shatner is at his absolute ""best"" at over emoting in this one, even taking the time to adopt a foppish girlish walk and filing his nails.  It's a miracle the almost erotic scenes of Kirk (while having Janice's personality) and Lester's boyfriend got by the NBC censors in 1968.  The scene where Kirk is forced into the personality transfer machine is almost laughable, because Kirk should have been able to overpower Lester without any trouble.  He's fought with Klingons hand-to-hand - and this woman succeeds where many far more powerful opponents fail?  Hah!
A really good story of transferral of personality was almost totally ruined by the acting.
My score - 5 out of a possible 10 (the slightly higher grade due to the fact that it's still ""Classic"" trek).",1029542400,2,1307,4.656521739130435

233672,5,6300213579,"I am writing this review from the possibly heretical viewpoint that holds that the original Star Trek TV series was one of the finest series ever shown on television whereas the subsequent motion pictures and follow-up series (e.g. The Next Generation) were very poor. Given that point of view, I believe that ""The Ulitmate Computer"" was one of the very finest episodes ever made because it contains the elements that made the original series so good, i.e. the psychology of military command, the conflict between pure logic as a basis for the proper organization of society vs. the need to also incorporate man's innately emotional character into the equation, the proper role of technology in society and its possible misuse or loss of control, the psychology of the intelligent, creative man as well as his weaknesses and the dynamics of a group of resourceful men working to get out of a crisis situation.  Although the episode is only 48 minutes long, the script writers were able to get it all into a single episode!  Unfortunately, these elements were sadly missing in the later versions of Star Trek which get lost in the fog of mysticism, artificial virtual reality and escapism. What also adds to the episode's magic is the brilliant guest starring performance of William Marshall, who plays the unstable genius, Dr Richard Daystrom.  All in all, a must for all fans of this marvelous TV series.",996019200,12,1405,4.919831223628692
