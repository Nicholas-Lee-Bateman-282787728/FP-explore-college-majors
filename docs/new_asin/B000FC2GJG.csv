8120547,4,B000FC2GJG,"Don Bernstine passed away unexpectedly in his sleep in April 2009.  He was a great friend and a tireless enthusiast of rock and roll, as this DVD illustrates.  Even when we were barely out of high school, major bands used to call him up and fly him to wherever they were, just because they liked hanging out with him.  Hanging with Don was the most fun I ever had, and he brought out the best in me.  I'm glad this DVD shows him doing what he loved.",1250121600,2,449,4.126436781609195
8120548,5,B000FC2GJG,"I'll keep it short because every other positive review of this item is absolutely correct. My boyfriend and I are hard core ""Hard Rock Cafe"" fans...and we both LOVE music. This dvd is a really cool look ""behind the scenes"" of how hard rock aquires their treasures. Has a lot of guest appearances from cool rock stars. It is an awesome dvd and I would recommend it to everyone.",1248912000,,376,4.463768115942029
8120549,4,B000FC2GJG,"Have you ever been sitting down, eating a nice meal at the 'Hard Rock Cafe' and you suddenly noticed some geek standing next to you, staring up at the walls. Well, that geek is probably me. I'm a self-confessed music geek, who just loves classic Rock music (but I listen to a whole lot of other stuff too!) and all the memorabilia, that goes along with it. So, when I go to to a 'Hard Rock Cafe', sure I'll take part in the dining experience with my hungry family. But I'll just as surely be wandering around the place staring intently at one of the late Jerry Garcia's oversized, Hawiian shirts or B&W photos of Muddy Waters hanging near the Men's Room.

So with that kind of mind-frame, it was a no-brainer to gleefully pick-up a copy of the DVD ""Hard Rock Treasures"". In this corporate, Rock-Doc production we are introduced to Host & Narrator, Don Bernstine, who must have one of the coolest Rock-Geek jobs ever! Don is the 'Director of Acquisitions' for the 'Hard Rock' Corporation. That basically means he gets to be the 'Indiana Jones' of the 'Rock N' Roll memorabilia world. He endlessly searches out and acquires, guitars, drums, clothing, posters, photos, letters, contracts, cars ETC. from around the world for the Hard Rock Corporation's massive collection, that is displayed within 122 restaurants, 15 Hotels & Casinos (and counting).

We follow Don as he travels around the world and across the USA on his memorabilia mission. We stop at the original 'Hard Rock' in London (where Eric Clapton gave the restaurant, their first guitar) and to Christie's auction house to learn about the fancy schmancy world of big bucks bidding. From there we go to such locals as Memphis (Sun Studios, Elvis's Graceland) and LA (the Hyatt ""Riot"" House, Norman's Rare Guitar House).

Along the way we get to visit the office/studios of groups such as Metallica, Aerosmith, Styx as well the private homes of Rick Neilson (Cheap Trick), Tony Iommi (Black Sabbath) Brian Johnson (AC/DC) and Vince Neil (Motley Crue) and more. In fact this DVD full is of comments and interviews from individuals in the Rock world. They include Duff Mckagan, Ian Paice, John Entwistle, Jimmy Page, Scotty Moore, Brian Wilson, Dave Amato, Richie Sambora, Fred Schieder, Nikki Six, Matt Roberts, Scott Weiland, Matt Surrum, James Young, Kiss, Peter Frampton, Doug Fleger,  ""Dimebag"" Darrell Abbott, Tom Hamilton, Joey Kramer, James Hatfield and Michael Anthony. That's just some of the folks who appear!

The DVD also takes you into the 'Hard Rock's' inner sanctum of a warehouse located in Orlando, Florida. The warehouse building might not be much to visually look at, but the huge collection does keep your interest. We learn how Don Bernstine and his team design, construct, ship and hang the memorabilia displays, that eventually appear in your local hometown restaurant.

If I have but one complaint about the DVD is that it really dosn't get into showing the viewer, what I would truely call ""Treasures"", that the title advertises. Yes, it is really cool to see the original Abbey Road doors, that the Beatles walked through on a daily basis or the piano, that Brian Wilson wrote ""Pet Sounds"" on, but come on! There is a heck of a lot more stuff out there in the various restaurants, that they could have dazzled us with! Show us some more of the 'Treasure' and a little bit less of the ""Dimebag"" Darrell Abott interviews! Even though this is a drawback, I would still recommend this DVD, because it gives us a peek at Don Berstine's fascinating job and how the 'Hard Rock' works 'behind-the scenes.' If you are a fellow, 'Music Geek' then give this DVD a try!",1169769600,2,3640,4.806709265175719
