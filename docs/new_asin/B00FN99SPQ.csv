8617132,5,B00FN99SPQ,"Rather stange that Man Doki and his soulmates have gathered so little attention in the US and UK. Considering that the records comprise so many great musicans playing an intricate blend of AOR, fusion, soul and funk. Here Leslie Mandoki returns to his native Hungary to celebrate 20 years of soulmates - their first album ""People"" was released in 1993 - and gathers together an all-star cast with Chris Thompson (Manfred Mann's Earth Band), Bobby Kimball (Toto), Randy Brecker, Chaka Khan, Jack Bruce, Greg lake, Al Di Meola, Peter Maffay, Bill Evans (Miles Davis, Mahavishnu Orchestra) a.m.o..

The repertoire is a mix of Man Doki originals written with his long-time musical partner keyboardplayer Laszlo Bencker and tracks from the involved artists respective groups so we got some Earth Band, Toto and ELP as well. Amongst the highlights is an obvious frail and ailing Jack Bruce delivering his hits ""White Room"" and ""Sunshine Of Your Love"" with some excellent and unconventional lead from Di Meola.

Everything is ofc well-played and well-sung although some of the originals suffer in comparision to the album versions sung by the likes of Jack Bruce, David Clayton-Thomas and Ian Anderson. Razor-sharp horn riffs, room for improvisation. All very well recorded even if the bass could have been louder in the mix. And filmed in best imaginable quality. There is also some bonus tracks from previous concerts featuring the likes of Ian Anderson, Steve Lukather and bass legend Anthony Jackson. And a very interesting behind-the-scenes documentary with interview clips from many of the involved musicians and even a recommendation from Mandoki's good friend Angela Merkel!",1423267200,,1675,5.246268656716418
