6584033,5,B00MK1RA4G,"Well, any number of seasons you throw at us we will keep watching this slow well crafted trilling suspense masterpiece.",1510790400,,119,5.0
6584034,5,B00MK1RA4G,"Complex stories, developing characters and a beautiful city:  and to top it off, the backgrund music is exquisite.",1509580800,,114,5.333333333333333
6584035,5,B00MK1RA4G,"Inspector Lewis spin-off from the Inspector Morse series was a good show itself. Lewis is not as self-absorbed or socially antagonist as his former DI. By the 7th season, he is getting old himself, and his partner in the show is perhaps being groomed to assume the post. It's old style British procedural in Oxford, and the partner is equally over-educated as Morse was. Honorable men who quietly go about seeking the miscreants of nefarious murders in a seemingly idyllic intellectual community in the old style, not overly reliant on forensics. I really enjoy the background music which sets the mood for this series, by Barrington Pheloung. That's how much I like it, I've never paid much attention to background composers of tv shows. After Inspector Morse disappeared from the steaming network this summer, I decided to buy the Inspector Lewis series. Both still entertain me. I barely watch contemporary regular tv anymore, so streaming these series as often as I like is very much appreciated.",1509321600,,1000,5.030120481927711
6584036,5,B00MK1RA4G,"Hats off to Robbie Lewis.  It's amazing he survived the eposidic hatchet job received weekly from INSP. MORSE.  Never could figure that out.  And to find a mutual, decent relationship between Lewis and Hathaway written into the script was the icing on the cake.  A great series.  INSP. MORSE comes in second place.",1507593600,,314,4.849056603773585
6584047,5,B00MK1RA4G,This is a great detective story.,1505088000,,32,4.5
6584048,5,B00MK1RA4G,One of my favorites! Always hate to see a season end.  we love these programs!,1504569600,,78,4.2
6584049,5,B00MK1RA4G,"Another awesome British TV Series, love Inspector Morse and Endeavour series as well.",1503878400,,85,5.615384615384615

6584052,5,B00MK1RA4G,I love this series.,1500940800,,19,4.0
6584053,5,B00MK1RA4G,"One of my fave series, right up there with ""Inspector Morse"" & ""Endeavour"". Superb production value, intricate & fascinating scripts and of course some of the best acting chops to be found anywhere. If you like quality British mystery/crime shows, you'll love every season of Inspector Lewis. Truly excellent stuff.",1499731200,,315,5.32
6584054,5,B00MK1RA4G,"...I know filmmakers try  for authenticity, but took it very unnecessarily far here. (and yes, this is my only problem with all seasons, I'm not a film critic. ;)",1497225600,,162,4.586206896551724
6584055,5,B00MK1RA4G,"We gave these to ourselves for Nativity to complete our set of ""Inspector Lewis"" DVDs.  I'm not a big fan of murder.  But, I really like the relationship between Lewis and his Sergeant Hathaway.  I like the setting too.  I've watched Morse and Endeavor, and this is the best so far.  I am not a fan of Inspector Morse, though I do kind of like him in Endeavor.  I like Lewis because he's always true--straight arrow.  It's sad to watch him lose his faith in God between the Morse series and this one, but having Hathaway as his sidekick kind of stirs up the conversation.  This and ""Foyle's War"" are our two main go-to DVD series.",1492905600,3,630,4.370689655172414
6584056,5,B00MK1RA4G,Have watched all of the Morse series and now the Lewis series. I have enjoyed them all. In the Lewis series I am happy that Lewis treats Hathaway better than Morse treated Lewis. Lewis and Hathaway make a good team. Thanks to all who have made this series possible.,1492041600,,265,4.428571428571429
6584067,2,B00MK1RA4G,"I only watch this because I've watched all the better ones. Neither main character is very likable. Both are very judgy and pretentious. Hathaway is better than Lewis until S7 and then he's just as big an ass. The storylines are generally starting out with some God hating premise or philosophy, some insult to anyone with any faith. Generally,  how dumb anyone is who has faith when there's all this ""reason"" that says otherwise. It's regularly insulting in this way. It lacks heart really. I love so many shows in this style from Poirot, Miss Marple, to Wallander, Happy Valley,  Broadchurch,  Luther,  and Endeavour. This show doesn't measure up to the weakest of those. It's literally a space filler until a better show comes along.",1491696000,,736,4.864

6584075,5,B00MK1RA4G,"The entire series is a great watch.  The English produce far superior mysteries than the U.S. whose always turns into a ridiculous soap opera such as NCIS which started out okay but went downhill quickly.
The British films I have watched over the last few years are always high quality in story and presentation....geared to better thinking than the U.S. versions which cater to the mind of a 6 year old with plots that are beyond fantastical nonsense.
Great series...hope it goes beyond season 7",1487635200,,496,4.8352941176470585

6584647,5,B00MK1RA4G,"I loved Inspector Morse and now that Lewis is the boss he's absorbed the sleuthing chops of his mentor. He also has his own sergeant now, James Hathaway. Hathaway is Cambridge-educated (Morse was Oxford-educated) and picks up the thread of erudite quotations and musings that Morse was so famous for. Hathaway also Lewis' more posh, better-educated emissary to the dons in the ivory tower that are often enmeshed in their murder investigations. Lewis, though, is more human, more vulnerable, and yet somehow tougher than Morse ever was. He's a widower and he has children and he is moored to the world in the way that makes Lewis an even richer show than Morse. I was so bummed when I ran through season 7. I hope we get one more season.",1476316800,,737,4.676923076923077

As the two ""Coppers"" have worked together and gotten to know each other and tolerate and celebrate each others' differences, the main characters have become even more likable.

6584805,5,B00MK1RA4G,"My wife and I have watched all episodes of all seasons of Inspector Lewis and find it to be excellent.  We are sorry that season 8 (which we watched on PBS) is the last season.  If they don't change their minds and bring it back for a season 9, we hope they will spin off an Inspector Hathaway series.  We never realized that Oxford was such a dangerous place to live.",1473465600,,368,4.154929577464789

Very unfair as you pay for Amazon Prime.  They do this with quite a few PBS shows that are shown on tv for free.  They get
you hooked and then want you to pay an additional fee.  AMAZON SHOULD NOT CHARGE ADDITIONAL FEES FOR SHOWS THAT THEY START

6584834,5,B00MK1RA4G,"I love them all seasons one through nine. It would be nice to have season eight be Prime. The reason I have Prime other than for shipping is for the ability to stream movies and TV for free. If they have the other seasons it would be great if they had the seasons up to the present one on Prime. For Lewis it would be up to season nine. They have several recent movies on Prime. Just saying it would be nice, not a deal breaker for me, but if the current season has ended, the series in the case of Lewis, it would be nice to be able to binge all the seasons up to the final season.",1472947200,,582,3.899159663865546

6584852,4,B00MK1RA4G,"I enjoy the interaction between the two main characters, and find this series more enjoyable than predecessor (Inspector Morse) on another streaming service.  Good if you enjoy trying to figure out ""who done it"" before police.",1472774400,,226,5.277777777777778
6584853,5,B00MK1RA4G,"This series is one of the few that I have watched 3-4 times from season 1 / episode 1 to season 6 and beyond now that Lewis is back in the saddle. I find the stories both ""lead"" and ""under lying"" well written and extremely well portrayed by all the actors. No character is left behind.
I was brokenhearted when the series ended with 6 seasons. Now I'm happy again that I will get to spend more time with Robbie, James and Laura
I will re-start the series now so that I will be able to watch season 8 since this season is not available unless I buy it.  Kinda sad about that.",1472774400,,574,4.079646017699115

6584858,5,B00MK1RA4G,"We have been burning thru all the British deceive series. Insp Lewis is one of the better ones because the writers know how to introduce plot twists without disrupting flow of narrative. Brillance of lead comes thru in unusual ways. Everything from seeing relationships we missed to knowing about collector cars peculiarities. If first episode isn't your cup of tea, you won't like rest of series.",1472774400,,397,5.03030303030303

I was blown away by John Thaw, and I still re-watch eps of ""Inspector Morse"" at least once a month so that I can keep him in my life. My love for Kevin continued on throughout the ""Inspector Lewis"" series. Unfortunately, in order to see my beloved Lewis, I had to put up with the often annoying Hathaway :/ . Laurence Fox is a great actor--at least in the few other roles that I've seen him play--but the character of James Hathaway annoyed the crap out of me after the first few seasons no matter how hard I tried to get over it.",1471478400,,594,4.265486725663717

6584956,5,B00MK1RA4G,Inspector Lewis features two of my favorite detectives. I enjoy these mysteries featuring Inspector Morse's longtime sidekick even more than those of Morse. Laurence Fox as the younger partner is outstanding character. Supporting cast has changed -- for the better -- over the years. Kinda funny that current season on PBS (already completed in England) is the final season -- again. They quit once and came back for two more years.,1470700800,,432,5.098591549295775

6584977,4,B00MK1RA4G,Season 7 didn't quite live up to the excellence I've come to expect from Inspector Lewis. Having been a Morse and Masterpiece fan for over two decades this season felt like a let down. Too much interpersonal struggle and not enough love between the characters felt off and distracting to me. This detracts from the stories instead of complimenting the relationships. Overall its a minor thing but just enough to understand why this show won't be renewed after the next season. The scenery and the music do however cover a multitude of sins making this still the best show currently on television.,1470182400,,596,4.852941176470588

Lewis has the experience, yet humility to be an excellent mentor for the data superior Hathaway. Both have a brooding side, but Lewis's brooding is more visible and visceral; while Hathaway's is more internal/contemplative.  Interesting story line, great scences of the Oxford sights and good acting. All the female lead characters come across as genuine people and professionals. I have forgotten the name of the new Sergeant working with newly minted DI Hathaway, but she is a gem too; a great addition to the team.

If it were not for my wife I would have cancelled the Prime membership already. I don't like it when they can just pull a show without even giving an explanation as to why. I watched all the episodes up until season 7 for free as a Prime member and then BAM no more Inspector Lewis - just not right. Amazon makes enough money - point

6585195,5,B00MK1RA4G,"This is a true masterpiece and mystery. Lewis and Hathaway are wonderful foyles for each other, their differences showing their distinct abilities, regardless of ""class"" or education. I've grown to love the setting of Oxford, you see the grand settings and then little secrets in the hallowed halls of the height of English academics (or so they would have you believe). The benefits of a wonderful education, self-awareness, down-to-Earth common sense and goodness are the threads woven throughout all the major characters and support the story lines.",1467504000,,552,5.35632183908046

6585304,5,B00MK1RA4G,Great Series.  We especially like the intellectual challenging aspects of these programs.  It's photography is wonderful as well and Oxford presents an extremely good background for the series.  We are only sorry that we have heard that the series will have its last year.,1465257600,,272,5.136363636363637
6585305,4,B00MK1RA4G,"I have thoroughly enjoyed every Inspector Lewis Season from 1 to 7. The partnership between Lewis and Hathaway has many endearing qualities and complexities. They keep me interested in who they are......which is not always the case in a series. (I have watched many from beginning to end)  Also, over seven seasons Lewis and Hathaway's relationship has remained solid while changing the power dynamic. I have liked that aspect of the series. Psychoanalyzing during the case never seems  to get ""sticky."" Lewis keeps it in bounds. I like that....even though that has been my profession.
Mysteries are my addiction. This series has been intriguing because I don't figure out ""who did it"" all the time. The challenge keeps me wanting to watch more and more. So....when is Season 8 going to be available?",1465257600,,800,5.007518796992481

6585311,5,B00MK1RA4G,"Another gem from the PGS Mystery series and Rebecca Eaton and a sequel to the very fine crime drama ""Inspector Morse"".  Like Morse this is set among the dreaming spires of Oxford and that beautiful city really becomes another character. Each episode is stand-alone and features superb performances by Kevin Whately and Lawrence Fox along with several other talented British actors. This is the second time viewing Lewis (I have all 6 of the original dvd's) but it is very convenient to have all now on Amazon streaming.

6585439,5,B00MK1RA4G,"I was a huge fan of the morse series,To see the continuity of this series and the prequel ""Endeavor"", has been a joy; to bad we can't do that in theU.S.",1462665600,,152,3.935483870967742
6585440,5,B00MK1RA4G,"I highly recommend this series to anyone who like detective stories.  Since this is a take-off of the Inspector Morse series, I can see the influence.  Throughout the Inspector Lewis series, he knows he has come into his own and he values the lessons he learned when Morse was his mentor.  He now mentors his own sergeant (Hathaway) with that same care and respect.  In series 7, Lewis made himself believe it was time to putter in his garden and make a life with the pathologist giving him an arms length existence from the world of detection.  However, his old team realizes they need him and he finds that he is being pulled back into the arena of crime solving.  He pretends to not really want to do it but he doesnt do things by halves and it is obvious he is happy to be back.  Gingerly he steps into the role of consultant and tries to be sensitive to Hathaways position.  This is not an easy task and he does blunder a bit but as he said, the thing he likes most about that job is that you never stop learning.  Hathaway has also been experiencing some growing pains. Do I recommend this series?  Oh yes, You need to watch series 1-7.  The characters draw you in and you feel you are part of what they are doing and thinking.  They never let you know who the bad buy is until the end, even in the last episode, ""Beyond Good and Evil"", there is a twist.  I was sad to hear that series 7 was the last it was like saying goodbye to an old friend.  I'm hearing rumors of a new series, fingers crossed!",1462665600,4,1505,4.216783216783217

6585493,4,B00MK1RA4G,The movie was fine; the streaming was the pits.  Amazon reloaded the program about every 4-5 minutes.  I know it is not my internet service because we have Netflix and the movies play straight through--no constant loading like Amazon did.  Streaming a movie is useless when the movies constantly stops and loads to continue.  One cannot keep track of the plot.  You will have to correct this problem if you want me as a customer.  The cost of Prime is not worth it if one joins Prime for streaming movies.,1461628800,,505,4.555555555555555

Hearing the Inspector Morse music in the background
and seeing Lewis watch Hathaway with the new DS brings back fond memories of Morse and Lewis from long ago. Hope the series continues.",1458259200,,288,5.568181818181818
6585582,5,B00MK1RA4G,"Big fan of this series.  Kevin Whately and Laurence Fox are great as cerebral detectives in a pompous and cerebral setting.  Most of the crimes involve students or faculty of Oxford University and require the detectives to match wits with arrogant and brainy professors and scholars.  The stories are great if not predictable at times but being a 1.5 hour show, the characters get a bit more treatment and the mysteries get a few more twists than the typical 1 hr American mystery show.  The beautiful filming of Oxford and the surrounding area is icing no the cake.",1458259200,,566,4.744897959183674
6585583,3,B00MK1RA4G,"This was a sort of pathetic follow-up to the previous Inspector Lewis series. Lewis has retired, and Hathaway is now in his previous position in the police force. But Lewis is ""called back"" to help on a case. A little bit of back and forth in the power struggle between the two men, who are friends but can also be competitive. A lot of long looks at Hathaway's long and sulky face, without a lot of input from him. He just gives a lot of looks, and we simply guess at what he's thinking or what he wants or why he's pissed off--or if he's pissed off. I missed the previous set-up, with Lewis in charge and Hathaway his smart, somewhat sarcastic deputy. Oh well, if you can't get enough of ""Lewis"" this is not quite a dessert, but more of an aftertaste.",1458259200,,753,4.2727272727272725

The setting is beautiful, the characters are rich, and the relationships are compelling.

6585592,5,B00MK1RA4G,"I prefer to watch more British tv than American but I do watch Masterpiece (in this case, Mystery) a lot. Somehow I don't pick up on the actors acting a bit too ""cool"" like their American counterparts. Lewis is a good example of what I mean, the cast play their roles well and the mystery is mostly believable to me. Kevin Whately and Laurence Fox make a great investigative partnership and they usually do a good deal of collaborating in their sleuthing and fact finding in and around Oxford University. Now Laura, the medical examiner, has been helping more often in investigations too as she and Robbie have gotten more involved than previous seasons. She has added spark to most of the stories in her own lovely way. I give this season and all the previous seasons five stars.",1458000000,,780,4.618705035971223

The bad guys (usually of the Oxford faculty or neighborhood aristocracy)  are pompous asses who we love to hate.  They commit dozens of murders in each series - who can keep count?  The unlikeable do-ers of the foul deeds are always found out by the good guys (policemen Lewis and Hathaway, a duo fashioned on the Inspector Morse series with John Thaw) who are endearing.  Even the most gruesome crimes seem somehow more palatable when done in Oxford amid all the bicycle riders, canals, green swards and Oxford landmarks.

6585846,5,B00MK1RA4G,"Just finished season ""7""....have to admit I never quite understood the season numbering between BBC and the US releases.  Doesn't matter of course since this, for me, has just been one of the most enjoyable series I have ever watched.  Isn't it wonderful to find that it still possible for the entertainment industry to produce a literate and interesting mystery series without all the whiz bang and gore that is so typical these days.  Was pleased to learn there is still one more season and hoping Amazon picks it up soon.",1453507200,,524,4.736263736263736
6585847,5,B00MK1RA4G,"The only thing to improve with this series is the sound.  I'm not sure if it is the lower volume that must always be turned much higher than normal for viewing, or if it is the heavy northern England accent that makes listening that much more more difficult.  Still, we love this series - the actors, the setting of Oxford (when can i go?!), the dry humor, the background music - and greatly look forward to another season being added ASAP.",1453507200,,440,4.419753086419753

6585851,4,B00MK1RA4G,"It is a formulaic detective show. Maybe that is unavoidable?  The murders are all rather creative and like the old Law and Order sometimes they are sort of ""torn from the headlines"".  This season has a little more focus on in office politics as the characters adjust to different roles.  That part of the show could be expanded to make a more interesting and less formulaic script- maybe showing the same thing from the vantage point of the different characters?  It is always fun to  vicariously explore Oxford through this show.  It is always fun to get the high brow language, quotations and insights from the characters.  I love having this show to watch and sort of wish it would keep going on.  But how many times can you do the same thing?  This series with Inspector Hathaway has introduce (in previous seasons) some of his character.  Inspector Lewis is rigorously normal.  Morse had issues.  Hathaway seems to have issues.  Hathaway's new Detective Sergeant Lizzie Maddox is a great character who could be explored more but isn't.  I love this show and would love to see some version of it continued with more about Lizzie and Jean Innocent.  Did Lizzie go to school?  Does she understand all the highbrow quotations too or just ignores them?  Also a little more about the current Oxford might be fun.  I notice that cyclists are mentioned in the plots (""It's like the Tour de France out there"").  Maybe notice that cyclists in Oxford are getting killed and hurt.  How are those things investigated by the local police.",1453507200,,1529,4.741444866920152

6585854,3,B00MK1RA4G,"I loved Seasons 1-6, adored them!  But Season 7...something felt off, wrong, disappointing.  If I had kept watching that first episode things might have evened out or something, keep that in mind as you're reading my review, but...I just couldn't.  So...the three available episodes of Season 7 were 2.5 unwatched because of my disappointment in how the characters got along.

Spoilers:

Hathaway and Lewis just don't quite ""jive"" right with each other now that Lewis is retired then, soon enough, semi-retired.  Hathaway has a bug up his rectum about getting the job done right which is a mood-killer all on its own.  I freely admit that I've never liked Hobson as Lewis' love interest and she's all over him so that was unfortunate.  It just wasn't the ""Inspector Lewis"" that I'd loved watching.",1453507200,,797,4.93984962406015

I am happy with the streaming experience. I really enjoy watching a long running show through a number of series in a short time - the character development is more obvious to me and I feel so much part of ""that"" world.

LOVE this show and hope Season 8 & 9 are available in the US soon.  The mysteries are very good and unraveled nicely.  The characters and the interactions, the progression of everyone's character and the character relationships are compelling.  I very much like how the characters are allowed to lose their tempers, deal with challenging situations and be ""real"" - at least it seems that way to me.

6586056,5,B00MK1RA4G,First rate. One of the best BBC Inspector series. Lewis' retirement is handled very well.,1445904000,,89,5.0
6586057,5,B00MK1RA4G,"This series continues the exceptionally high standards set by the one that inspired it, the excellent Inspector Morse. Morse in my opinion outdoes the rest no matter how good some of the others are. That said, it is interesting to see Robbie after such a long absence. Of course he is still sadly working through the loss of his wife, his son and daughter are grown and living their own lives elsewhere. Add to this Lewis's new sidekick as grumpy and in his old world as Morse was. Lewis can get his grump on with the best of them though. Great writing. Interesting story lines. Superb acting. Love it. From 1st to last. What more can you say? The current series delivers just like all that gone before it.",1445731200,,706,4.48062015503876

6586099,5,B00MK1RA4G,"This continuation of the Inspector Morse Mysteries is superior, in my opinion.  Inspector Lewis brings a practicum of procedure and his erudite sergeant  brings a tangent of the Oxford braininess that marries into an effective team worthy of of the Morse legacy. Season 7 finds Lewis retired and happy with his new life, but just when he thinks he's out... they pull him back in!",1445299200,,379,4.815384615384615
6586100,5,B00MK1RA4G,"Inspector Lewis is retired and Hathaway has been promoted to DI. One certainly gets the impression that Lewis bored but refuses to admit it. Hathaway has a problem giving his subordinate Sergeants tasks and responsibilities. His first Sergeant requested a transfer and his second one DS Lizzie Maddox is in the process of transferring as well.

It seems that the Oxford police need more manpower and Innocent uses that situation as an excuse to bring back DI Lewis. She adds him to Hathaway' s team.

There is a bit of tension at first, each wondering what their roles will be in this threesome. Lewis starts giving Maddox more responsibility and as times passes and Hathaway sees her worth, he also begins to trust her more.

The addition of Maddox works well and is seamless. The acting, as usual is first-rate and the stories are all good, although, my favorite is the last, ""Beyond Good and Evil"", which also happens to be a title of a Nietzsche book and his ideas do figure prominently though they are not overbearing.

In all a wonderful return and great new dynamic between Lewis and Hathaway. I hope this series is not the end of Lewis and Hathaway.",1445212800,,1157,4.684729064039409

6586174,5,B00MK1RA4G,"""Inspector Lewis"" is one of my all-time favorite TV series. It isn't quite as good as ""Inspector Morse,"" but it's a very close second. I would like to see another spin-off after Season 9 to ""Inspector Hathaway."" I would love to see it continued. The ""Inspector"" series is so much better than all the other inferior cop shows, especially the American variety with the exception of possibly the original NCIS, but even then none of them capture the smart style and laid-back intelligence of these Brit creations. I particularly enjoy the soundtrack of all the ""Inspector"" series.",1444176000,,577,4.958762886597938

6586183,5,B00MK1RA4G,I love the way the writers had Kevin kept Lewis going after Morris passed on and how from time to time they still make mention of Morris I hope when the time comes they will be able to do the same with Hathaway.

6586272,5,B00MK1RA4G,"I like the changes with the characters - Lewis retiring then going back to work and feeling his way under his protege.
There is normal awkwardness and realistic changes involved in ALL the characters and plot developments.
The characters are well-rounded and still transitioning with life in a realistic way.
They maintain a general good ethics and NOT too overly graphic or overdone unrealistic drama plots.
I am never left feeling stressed out or upset due to an episode - just intrigued and entertained.

Wonderful seasoned actors with individual interpretations on the characters they are playing.
Maybe because it is a British production, the actors are not ""Americanized  ""Barbie & Ken"" make-upd actors.

I do find it interesting, no matter how many British mysteries I watch - It is amazing to me just How MANY murders CAN take place in a little village in England in just one year. The fact that the police don't carry guns - also creates unlimited themes on ALL the other ways that the murders take place......",1441843200,,1019,4.912790697674419

6586316,5,B00MK1RA4G,This is a fantastic season of a great series. The writers and actors really hit their stride after season 1. I loved Morse but this is even better. The one last thing that needs to happen with series 8 is - get Hathaway a girl! I think the song Demons by Imagine Dragons would be a great backdrop/theme song to accompany a romance story with the serious and sometimes tormented Hathaway. So glad that Lewis and Hobson got together at last! I wish this show could go on and on but I suppose all good things must come to an end.,1441324800,,526,4.217821782178218

6586333,4,B00MK1RA4G,"I read some of the more recent reviews for this 7th (UK-8th) series. One reviewer states that the names of the three episodes on these two disks is not listed on Amazon; however they are, if one reads the Product description, and are the same for the UK version. Also, two reviewers stated that there was a difference of 10 minutes between the UK version, being 120 min per episode compared to the PBS, Masterpiece version being 90 min. (I had had the UK version but never checked the actual running time of the episodes themselves). I checked the timing on the UK version on Amazon.uk site and the box reads 267 min (2-disk, though one UK reviewer states it is actually 266 min.). According to this timing, (on the box) for  the UK version to arrive at the equal timing of the US version of 90 min, with the advertisements, either the PBS version is longer or the UK version has been cut, per episode, approximately 23 min. (?)  Whatever the actuality, my final thought was, is the cut time a critical difference in story or plot?

Seasons 1-6
Inspector Morse is older (just beyond middle age), Oxford educated and specifically erudite of opera, which he loved, irritating (of his own intolerance) ""old fashioned,""often self-centered, arrogant, even to his own division and others, unmarried, and often rebellious of procedural protocol, irritating most of his co-workers. His work,his profession, was all he had, and was his only life, success. He drank beer on the job as he pleased, always trying to coax Lewis into the same. In his staunch attitude of perfection, doing it his way (the better way), he did not often give credit to his underling partner, detective Lewis, who in his occasional brilliance of critical clues, helped him solve some hard cases. He was kept on because of his ""preciseness"" of logical skills which gave him much success and was a loner, both in his profession and personal life.
When detective Lewis wanted to move up, Morse, seemingly jealous (of his ""youth), did not encourage Lewis to take the Inspector exam when he was willing and ready (a strong push from his wife) but then finally does, upon finding out about his medical diagnosis, of which he then decides to retire.
It was Morse's depth of character in his own fallible character traits and personality that drew me to this series. He could not see his own frustrating loneliness and frailty of which he most often judged in the commonness of most others, as either being incompetent, lacking vision, unwilling to strive for more knowledge (which expands and is power itself), or just less able, precisely so, as he would say, missing the greater, due to their superficial minds, attitudes, choice of profession in their lower commonality in life, themselves, while struggling internally with some of the same,  of his own ""falling short"" of his own expectations, and not having found a compatible (or commit worthy) companion.

In 7, (combining the UK series 7, 8) in agreement with another reviewer, I also found it somewhat slower, and lighter of character compared with Morse's character. In season 7 (the first disk), some of the story details of Lewis' attitude and future personal decision shadow Morse's, though Inspector Lewis is mostly in contrast to Morse, excepting times when he verbalizes some of his own (Morse's?) arrogance of his experience, knowledge and position. His very young, inexperienced partner detective, Hathaway, is irritated with this, using subtler, more personal ways, strategies to deal with others, especially those not too far from his age. Lewis has a personal irritation that Hathaway is even younger than he was when he joined with Morse (as Morse felt about him) and who and is also Oxford educated (somewhat intimidating for Lewis).
Lewis is less analytical (and less educated) than Morse was, coming from a more common background, following in the footsteps of many of his peers, who's fathers and back, were policemen and is a team player. He is more inter-personally and socially adept at relationships, lighter of personal being, seeing life and people from a horizontal, plain, view. He works hard and to eventually climb up, (he shows respect and comraderie for his fellow policemen and so is much liked and respected himself), and yet chooses to challenge himself to learn from Morse how to be more precisely observant, and so, see more deliberately, unseen clues, to better his skills and himself. He has even pushed himself to learn about, to become, just a little bit more educated about the classical arts (literature, music). He also gets involved with the pathologist, Dr. Laura Dobson, who was also interested in Morse, who had a fear of intimacy, commitment, so it never progressed.  But in Lewis' case, they go forward from friends to ""couple"" and move in together and are content, as he retires, yet comes back part-time (not compatible to Laura) to solve some hard cases and one that will challenge him from his beginning years.
On disk 2, enter detective Hathaway, soon to be Inspector Hathaway, who is less confident about himself, (Morse had his music and beer Hathaway has literature, art, his smokes-incessantly, and then tries to quit)  his line of work, and secretive about his personal life, seeming to be internally searching for something more humanely uplifting, giving him more challenge, responsibility, power, as Lewis emphasizes his experience, knowledge and position, when Hathaway seems to crowd him or find clues he misses. He is also Oxford educated (intimidating for Lewis) but not boastful of it. He is almost as alone as Morse was, yet more intellectually engrossed in other things. He shows a personal experience and strength for younger people, as lost as he is internally. He resents Lewis' attitude, resentment (which Lewis does eventually reveal) though sometimes sees clear about it, yet it pushes him for change. Nevertheless, he is unsure of his future expectations, not shaped yet, though wanting a stronger, defined identity. When he reveals to Lewis that he wants to try for the upgrade to Inspector, Lewis does as Morse did, and tries to put him off, as he himself is serious about retirement, telling Hathaway he needs more time, as Hathaway then reveals he wants to leave. But he doesn't, Lewis encourages him, he goes forward and becomes the next in line of Inspectors.
In some ways, the mystery of Hathaway reminds me of Morse's internal dialogue, but from a wider perspective (being younger, more aware), and yet quietly, with some of Morse's own questions about the lack of sanctity of life:  darkness of life, cavalier thinking about oneself, others, degradation of values, and greatest, death and specifically, young death. While Morse whined, Lewis questioned emotionally, and now Hathaway tries to face and accept. I hope there will be a season 8 (9)!",1441152000,,6846,4.967713787085515

Only complaint is that Amazon has the entire series, but doesn't have the Pilot for Lewis to stream.  Come on Amazon.  We who love the genre are lost without it.  And PS...please put the prequel for Morse back on Prime.  Those three are winners.  Why the Pilot for Endeavour is no longer on was a really bad idea.  Please!

6586580,5,B00MK1RA4G,"I love Lewis...everything about this series is quality--from the writing to the acting to the City of Oxford itself.  Whately is masterful as the moral, kind Everyman, Lewis, and Laurence Fox is his perfect foil as the enigmatic, slightly overly intellectual Hathaway.  These two actors are effortless and completely believable filling their characters' shoes.  Angela Griffin is a nice addition, too, and is carefully written so that she adds depth, but doesn't interfere with the Lewis/Hathaway long-term bromance.  And I'm glad they finally got Lewis and Hobson together--although that relationship, while ""old shoe"" comfortable, seems unnaturally and unnecessarily superficial.  Maybe that's just the famous British reserve.
A great part of what makes this series work is relationship--Lewis with Hathaway, Lewis with Hobson, Lewis and Hathaway with Innocent (I was very sorry to hear they have ditched Rebecca Front in the upcoming new season) and Maddox--and the main characters' unflagging moral compass.  Yet the series writers seem reluctant to lay bare much of what makes their main characters tick--their back stories and their feelings.  They give all the depth to the characters and chaos du jour, rather than to those who drive the series.
The Lewis plots are convoluted and byzantine, the backdrops, music and cinematography are always gorgeous and DI Lewis, DI Hathaway, Doctor Hobson, CS Innocent and DS Maddox are easy folks to like.  Series 7 is more of the same good ""who-dunit"" genre in the style of ""Morse"" and its prequel, ""Endeavour."" Unlike many of the shoot-em up, car chase, blood-drenched American cop shows, ""Inspector Lewis"" is intelligent, engaging and a pleasant way to spend some down time.  I'm always pleased to return to Oxford and visit again with my favorite peace-keepers--although given what must be an outrageous murder rate for a city Oxford's size, I'm not sure I'd live in that beautiful old university town.",1438214400,,1952,5.311688311688312

Meanwhile Hathaway is not getting along with his female sergeant. He ignores her and acts toward her as if she is incompetent.

Season 7 was very interesting as some issues from earlier years popped up to make Robbie Lewis reflect back on his career.  Detective Hathaway has moved up the ladder in the police force and that presents an interesting dynamic between the two.

6586909,5,B00MK1RA4G,"Season 7 has a slightly different premise: Detective Inspector Lewis, having retired, comes back to work part-time to help his former sergeant, James Hathaway, adjust to being a DI with a sergeant of his own.  Hathaway's sergeant, a young woman of color, is an interesting and enjoyable character in her own right and a welcome addition to the show. The deep personal connection between Hathaway and Lewis is not really a feature in this season, particularly because Hathaway is initially less than thrilled at Lewis's return, but enough of the original elements -- great chemistry and writing -- are there for long-term fans, like myself, to enjoy this new variant.  It is a bittersweet but also happy continuation of the series, particularly after the ending of Season 6, when it seemed as though there would be no more episodes of Lewis.  However, there were only 3 episodes in season 7, so I do hope there will be a Season 8!",1434412800,,929,4.79375

6586930,5,B00MK1RA4G,"Lewis and Hathaway are brilliant  - again!  They are a great team together and the series is so well produced.  I wish there were additional episodes and that we didn't have to wait until next year for the Season 8.

6586933,5,B00MK1RA4G,Both the writing and the acting in this latest series keep up the fine tradition of the Inspector Morse mysteries.

6587024,5,B00MK1RA4G,"This is one of the best series on television even though I have to watch it with closed captioning to catch everything. (And the captioning is excellent.)  Never disappoints with intelligent plots and clever conversation.  Too bad there are not more episodes in a season!  I am so glad to hear that they will be making a 9th series (our Season 8 on PBS).  All the actors are superb, and I love Clare Holman's portrayal of the forensic pathologist so much that I can forgive the occasional forensically flawed lines she is given to say.  If I could change the one thing that does really annoy me,  I'd ask them to dispense with the constant smoking of Laurence Fox. who plays Sgt. Hathaway.  Yes, I know a lot of cops do smoke, but it serves no purpose in the plot, the young man himself would be better off for quitting (like Helen Mirren's character in Prime Suspect did), and far too many people die each year as the result of smoking for the television and film industry to keep portraying it as something that cool and sophisticated, intelligent people do.",1433721600,,1060,4.5473684210526315

I won't say what because I don't want to give anything away.  However, I find that I am holding off on watching the final episode only because I'm so devastated that this is the end.

I know it's a murder mystery show but the first episode has an 18 year old that's turned quadriplegic by a surgeon and a dad that commits suicide. It was a little heavy for my taste.

Good surprise to find a Season 7 and read Season 8 will be made as well.  Kevin Whately and Laurence Fox are a good pair and the added DS Lizzie Maddox (Angela Griffin) was necessary since DS James Hathaway has been promoted to Inspector and a DS would be needed.

Low key English murder mysteries, light on violence, more emphasis on solving each crime. Very well written. No silliness. If you should enjoy this program, look for another called Midsomer Murders.",1432944000,,314,5.176470588235294
6587204,5,B00MK1RA4G,"Just loved this!  Great to see actor Kevin Whately step into his own after John Morse died...with Edward Fox's son playing Hathaway...great continuity of story line and 'theatre' tradition!
Whately brings a universal down to earth quality to his transplanted Northen 'coppa'  (copper after the copper buttons on the English police uniforms.) while Fox adds the syntonic 'Oxford' sophistication to his 'clergyman' turned detective - a brilliant replacement for the operatic Morse.  The actress playing the medical examiner who is also Whately's wife/gf is wonderfully warm and intelligent - a real English rose.

For the newcomer, great acting, beautiful location, intricate but not convoluted plots and mostly charming characters.  Less sadism, ie, far fewer 'loving' close-ups of murders in progress than other series.  One can just enjoy the unfolding of the plots!  Definitely will watch again...",1432944000,,899,5.5661764705882355

I like the English setting and English culture.  This season has good bones meaning:  good acting, no loose ends.  However,  sometimes i think they go way out of the way to create a plot that the viewer can not predict.  Thus,,  it can feel contrived.  That can be a turn off for me but most of the time,  i find them to be ok.  It does not stop me from watching since I love mysteries.",1432080000,,527,4.202020202020202

6587436,5,B00MK1RA4G,I just like English detective stories and I followed inspector Morris for years. In fact when in  one of the last stories he had a heart attack and it started by him complaining of a weakness in his Arm and grapping his arm and then collapsing. Well when I had my Hear attack and didn't do the above my Wife would not believe I had a heart Attack until the Doctor Specifically told her I did.

6587437,5,B00MK1RA4G,"I am fond of this series, and frankly prefer Lewis to his previous boss, Inspector Morse. The mysteries are always puzzling and the effort to solve them keeps my attention throughout. I find Lewis a particularly human character, plagued by impatience with the system and totally engrossed in his work and Kevin Whately's character has matured into a fine inspector. I hope the show continues for many more years.",1431907200,,412,4.9855072463768115

Inspector Lewis and his professional wife interact well, which is a bit amazing in that both are so very busy in the respective lives.  He doesn't always get home evenings til late for example.

6587571,5,B00MK1RA4G,"I've always enjoyed this series. My only regret is that season (one year) is as little as three 90 minute episodes. Really good points are: The actors speak English that we ignorant Americans can understand. Unlike some other popular series set in Britain, there isn't the annoying constant background 'music' constantly overwhelming the dialog.

6587587,5,B00MK1RA4G,"Interesting characters, intriguing scenarios, and above average dialogue come together to create a 5 star crime British crime drama.  U.S. writers would do well to watch a few episodes of this and Downton Abbey to learn what it takes to become above average entertainment.  Inspector Lewis demonstrates that excellent programming doesn't need crude humor, stupid characters, perverted dialogue and behavior, and all of the other staples of modern American T.V., and movies.

I highly recommend Inspector Lewis.",1431648000,,510,5.597402597402597

I watched all of the Morse episodes, and then when that went away, was really glad they brought Inspector Lewis back to his own show.  Then they brought on Endeavor, which I have also enjoyed.

Morse was excellent, but I find Inspector Lewis to be even more my speed. Lewis is just as solid & upstanding as I could ever want in a law enforcement hero, and Hathaway is a complex character I enjoy to getting to know just a little bit more with each episode.

As I have mentioned before, I would watch the pilot first before watching Season 1, it does give you some information not included in the first season episode. I am also at the end of the seventh season and I am sad to see it end. The UK always does an excellent job with writing and acting in any of their programs. I would also recommend starting from the beginning and following through as each season progresses, that way you are getting the little nuances between characters as time goes on. If you have enjoyed the Masterpiece mysteries in the past, this series will not disappoint.",1430697600,,746,4.413043478260869

However this is a nice way to ease the pain. Despite Lewis' retirement he and  Hathaway still find opportunities to work together and Hathaway's new partner is enjoyable and does not interfere with camaraderie I have come to love.

What is interesting to me is that the Lewis mysteries have never really been the best, always somewhere in the middle and a few of them have been down right lame, but quite frankly it is the partnership of the two male leads that I believe puts this series ahead of the rest. Kevin Whatley and Lawrence Fox are just some how perfectly made for each other.

The murderer was not immediately evident and the explanation, while adequate, gave the impression of having been edited for time - which I understand PBS has done.

However the remaining stories redeemed this season. Fox is now the DI and Lewis is retired but comes back to help out. I am not sure why the writers have done this but I assume the series will begin afresh soon as FOX rather than LEWIS as I can see no other reason for such artifice. Unfortunately, ENDEAVOUR, the series about the young Morse is a better series all around but I suppose there is still room for Lewis and Fox too.",1424304000,,659,4.409836065573771

6588035,4,B00MK1RA4G,"First, an important note. There are - as I post this review - almost 300 reviews posted for this release.  Since it was not released by PBS Home Video until November 2014 all the other reviews are probably based on the US Broadcast Version. So when reading reviews before November I would suggest taking that into consideration. I see there are comments about editing. The PBS BD contains the original UK episodes which run about 93 minutes each. Since PBS airings are usually 85 minutes - allowing stations to promote other shows and provide sponsorship intros - that means about eight minutes has been excised. Since I did not see the TV versions, I can't tell what was cut. It was not for sex or strong language (neither of which is here) so it may be violence.

As for the three stories here, I enjoyed the relationship among the police officers but I found the stories fairly confusing with way too many suspects (especially in the second story). The original series was based on the Inspector Morse novels by Colin Dexter. These stories are newly written and only based on the characters, in order to use the Morse and Lewis names for merchandising. So, yes, I enjoyed watching the three stories here (2 are on disc one and one on disc two) but I can't say I loved them.

There are no special features on the BD set.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6588040,5,B00MK1RA4G,"I love this program so much more than the American crime shows that all end with shooting everything up, completely impossible scenarios and every character having to be beautiful. I find these 2 refreshing! The story lines are plausible and the length gives it enough time to really get to the details instead of the rush of stupid criminals and genius cops on every other channel. Sick of everyone having to be drop dead gorgeous on USA tv. I've never walked into a police station and saw anyone close to what the cops look like on programs like CSI and NCIS. I never understood... If they write a great story, looks don't matter.
I am so happy thet Robbie & Laura are finally together and they aren't making the characters play silly games with each other just to add more drama. James is my favorite character... He is so deep and we have no idea what is really going on in his head. I hope he finds real love, I think that would open him up more and make him feel complete. I just absolutely love this program. Bravo to the writers, thank you for keeping the characters & the stories real).

Every episode is a rich symphony...music, photography, personal interplay, tempo, old demons, new problems, love, deep human concern: it's all there and delightful. And to describe the photography (again) is one of those ""words fail me"" situations: it is lush with the images of Oxford, so beautifully tied to the plot development, and rich with images that will stay in your head for a very long time. Buy this group of great stories, then go back and buy series 1-6, and if you can honestly say you've ever seen anything better in the way of relationship drama and mystery, I'd really like to know what it is...this is the best series I've ever seen, head and shoulders above everything else, including the incredible Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes.",1421107200,3,879,4.866666666666666

6588093,5,B00MK1RA4G,"Great to have Inspector Lewis back! It's also wonderful knowing another series has also already been decided on.  All 3 episodes of Series 7(Series 8 in the UK) continue at the excellent quality level of all the previous series. The stories were all absorbing, acting topnotch,  great scenery, & some nice new wrinkles to the series, as well. The domesticity of of Lewis & Laura Hobson is a nice change, as well as the basic equality now between Lewis & Hathaway, now that James has been promoted. They're more like friends now. A wonderful addition is Angela Griffin as newcomer DS Lizzie Maddox. She doesn't intrude on the Lewis-Hathaway chemistry, but proves to be a loyal & hard-working character, who is very likeable. The softening of their boss Innocent has been a nice development over the years(she was a real shrew in the early episodes!). Bottom line of all this is that the return of Lewis is like the return of an old friend, & I hope it continues for several more years. As has been the case for many years now, these DVD's are the full UK-length editions(they run around 93 minutes for each episode). You get the 10+ minutes of each episode that's cut from the PBS Masterpiece Mystery episodes when shown on PBS television to fit their time slot. Like all the previous Lewis episodes(as well as the wonderful Endeavour series), you need to watch every minute so closely. Taking out 10+ minutes is a major crime in itself!",1420675200,4,1436,4.694444444444445

6588122,5,B00MK1RA4G,"This was series 8 in the UK and Series 7 in the US. The DVDs have the full UK episodes with no edits.
At the end of Lewis Series 6 it really looked as if the book had finally closed. Lewis was off to happy retirement with Dr Hobson, DS Hathaway was leaving the police and there were few loose ends. Game Over.
Or Not.
In this series Hathaway has returned to the police and is now a detective inspector. Lewis is brought out of retirement to act as a mentor to him. In the first episode there is some tension as the new roles are explored and as a new character DS Lizzie Maddox is integrated into the cast. The development of the characters is wonderfully followed over the three episodes.
The series retains its previous strengths. It is carefully paced with sufficient twists and turns to keep you intrigued throughout each episode. The locations are carefully chosen and filmed in a very evocative way and Barrington Pheloung's music is another treat. It's great to see Clare Holman take a more leading role too.
The excellent performances of Lawrence Fox, Kevin Whately, Clare Holman, and Rebecca Front can be taken as read. Where this, and every other, series of Lewis really differentiates itself from other shows is the excellence of the supporting cast. I wish these performances could go to the oscars as the actors outdo themseles with marvellously observed and understated performances that do them and the series credit.
At the end of the series it's hard to see how there could be another one (but I said that after series 6 too) and it seems plausible that Hathaway could become the next Mores with Lizzie Maddox as his Lewis. Time will tell.",1419984000,,1656,4.6169491525423725

6588126,4,B00MK1RA4G,Inspector Lewis had retired and gotten married since the last set. He now gets asked to come back and help out his former detective Sargent but wants to be more aggressive or pursue investigations differently than his former underling.

Can't quite put my finger on it, but the relationship between Lewis and Hathaway, which has always been such a selling point for this series, hasn't seemed to survive the transition to Hathaway's new status as well as it might. Still good, comfortable characters and standard (and delightful) Oxford scenery...and still far better than so many other things on television.",1419724800,,487,5.177215189873418

This time out broadcast/release dates weren't that much different so no PAL DVD's for me.
Still just three stories but this time out Hathaway is back on the force as an Inspector with new partner Lizzie Maddox ( I suspect ITV has thoughts of an eventual ""Inspector Hathaway"" series) with Lewis bored out of his mind in retirement and still with Laura Hobson. Lewis gets called out of retirement to assist in the first and stays on as a part time (all the time it looks like) job.
The stories are good but I like #3 ""Beyond Good and Evil"" the best of the three myself - it also has the most Oxford to it.
Worth owning if you like previous seasons.",1418169600,,854,4.3105590062111805

The Oxford landscape combined with really interesting mysteries that focus on students and teachers at the college, are always so fascinating.

6588253,4,B00MK1RA4G,"This would be 5 stars - but for the last of the 3 episodes. Since it's only 3 episodes, a miss on one makes a big difference. The first 2 episodes are spectacular - very well written and credible mysteries.. Love the characters and the actors are charismatic - in a different way, but you can't help but love them! - and they can act. A welcome change from 99% of American television.

However, then comes episode 3 - which is just plain sloppy writing. I am always willing to suspend disbelief in aid of excellent everything else, but this episode is so far from belief that we found ourselves groaning. Not a spoiler, since this happens within the first 15 - 20 minutes, a woman is smuggling pills to a prisoner into an institution for the criminally insane, gets caught, and is not arrested. I mean, really! In the same scene, a cell phone is found hidden in the cell - and the guard not only doesn't get fired, but no one seems to find this worth looking into. There's more in a similar vein later in the episode, but that might count as spoiler, so am not going there.

So, you might want to see for yourself - don't miss the first two episodes no matter what, but prepare to be disappointed in the last one. I wish there had been more - 3 is not enough, especially if one is a dud.",1415145600,,1287,4.248979591836735

6588257,5,B00MK1RA4G,"The team is all back for another series, with Robbie Lewis coming out of retirement because the super says that they are short handed. Maybe she senses that James Hathaway is not his usual sardonic self or totally up to the task of solving murders on his own now that he is a detective himself. A young lady sergeant, married, and very keen and steady, adds to the team. Laura is still the pathologist, though the romance with Robbie goes on the rocks a bit when he decides to come out of retirement. The dynamic between the two male leads is still great, though a bit different now that they are supposed to be equals.  Maybe they are not as parky together as usual, but we get the sense of a year having passed and James going through some issues.  If you are a fan, this is a must see.

6588280,4,B00MK1RA4G,"Interesting to me is that the seventh season of Inspector Lewis is the best of all. Lewis does not seem as uptight, and he is a much more likable character. Hathaway has changed,and he is also a much more likable guy, still uptight but more down to earth, if that is possible.

Kevin Whately who plays Inspector Robbie Lewis is struggling in his retirement status. He and the pathologist, Dr Laura Hobson, played by Clare Holman, are now married. They seem very happy, but Lewis is at loose ends. He cooks the family dinner, and it is burned. Laura tries to help him, and she suggests gardening etc. and, then, surprisingly, Lewis receives a call from Chief Superintendent Innocent. She tells him they are short staffed and wonders if he would come back in a part time basis working with Hathway. Hathaway, played by Laurence Fox has resolved his issues with his work as a policeman, and has been promoted to Inspector. So, Lewis would be working under Hathaway. What a magic turn around. I loved it.

The three new cases are excellent, but my favorite was the last. A serial murderer that Lewis put away over ten years ago has asked for a retrial with new evidence. In the meantime someone is committing the same type of murders with the same weapon and targeting policemen. Of note one of the new policemen works with Hathaway, and she is DS Lizzie Maddox. She is superb, and quite a match with Hathaway. They make a good team.

This seems to be a more down to earth series. Hathaway has his own ways and Lewis is trying to figure out where he fits in. I liked this a great deal.

6588281,3,B00MK1RA4G,"I'm disappointed in season 7. It's very ordinary and predictable, and they've eliminated whatever made 'Lewis' interesting to watch. The idiosyncracies, actually even the qualities, the likes and interests, of Hathaway are no more. No more 'world music' or erudite little insights. Substituted for these interesting touches are long close-ups, always in the same black topcoat with the gray insert at the neck, which he is not really up to, or shots of him smoking. And he frowns too much. Lewis has become so simple and predictable that he is boring. Maybe his marriage did this to him, but if so he shouldn't have gotten married until the end of this series. The touching and often humorous mentor/student relationship between the two is gone, replaced by a cliche about an old guy not being able to let go and a slightly annoyed newly promoted young guy. Also, why are they so often jumping up from the table just after they've gotten their beverages? Is it supposed to add excitement? Doesn't do it, it's just very annoying. Episode 3 was so same old same old. How ridiculous to throw in the husband of Hathaway's new partner as a suspect and have him cry like a baby in the examining room! Added nothing. Practically embarassing. It's as if they just can't muster any enthusiasm to do a really good story.",1413936000,5,1310,4.75
6588282,5,B00MK1RA4G,"I love this series, but the buyer of this DVD should be aware that this is not Season 7. It is, in fact, Season 8 of the series. For some reason, PBS doesn't seem to realize they never released the actual Season 7 on its own (it is miscounted and included in the 1-6 collected edition), and calling this the 7th Season doesn't make it so. If you're following the series through the single season releases of PBS, beware that you will be missing three full episodes that come prior to this set.",1413936000,,493,4.311827956989247
6588283,5,B00MK1RA4G,"Although the actors in this series said they were moving on, they are back much to the delight of their fans. This time there is a new dynamic. Hathaway is in charge! And he's delightful as boss. He has grown up before our eyes! Thankfully, Lewis can handle it and there's not much friction between the two. Their camaraderie is appealing in this series. Can't imagine Morse playing second fiddle to Lewis, but Lewis does it with grace and they actually operate as kind of equals.

Hathaway has an assistant, a beautiful young sargeant. She is smart, and engaging. A definite plus to the old boys club if I may express it.

These changes bring a freshness to this series, but there's enough of the usual to be comfortable. Of course the familiarity of Oxford as the backdrop is a HUGE attraction. There are some great shots of it this season. Was a little peeved at Hathaway for throwing his cigarette down in its hallowed street in the last episode.

The first episode in this season was very choppy with plots and subplots which rather confused. Guess we saw the cut version. The third episode was much more cohesive and focused. Looking forward to more please.",1413849600,10,1163,4.635922330097087
6588284,4,B00MK1RA4G,"""Inspector Lewis Season 7"" actually finds DI Robbie Lewis (Kevin Whately) retired. James Hathaway (Laurence Fox) has been promoted to DI and has a new partner, DS Lizzie Maddox (Angela Griffin). The series is getting away from its tradition of plots that revolve around the academic community at Oxford University. One episode features Oxford prominently; another integrates one university professor; and the other ignores Oxford entirely. James Hathaway has lost some appeal, as he no longer seems to be a fish out of water in the police department. DS Lizzie Maddox is hard-working and working-class. She's a good character but suffers from being a token female, added for no reason except to have a female detective in the field. DCS Jean Innocent (Rebecca Front) is still the boss. Dr. Laura Hobson (Clare Holman) is still the police pathologist. The mysteries are entertaining enough, but, in ""Entry Wounds"" and ""The Lions of Nemea"", the tangled relationships between the characters overshadow the murder mysteries. The PBS Shop claims that this DVD contains the full UK versions, which would be 360 minutes. But it also says that this DVD is 270 minutes long, which would be the US versions. So we have ourselves another mystery.

""Entry Wounds"" begins as a retired DI Robbie Lewis is living with Dr. Laura Hobson, the police department pathologist, and tinkering in his backyard. James Hathaway has been promoted to Inspector following a pilgrimage to Spain, and he's been assigned a new partner, DS Lizzie Maddox. Lewis is coaxed out of retirement by DCS Innocent to alleviate the department's staffing problems just after a hunting lodge owned by Tom Marston (Aden Gillett) is burned to the ground.  Marston has been receiving threatening messages from animal rights activists. Then his business partner Dr. Alastair Stoke (Jonny Phillips), a neurosurgeon, is murdered on the grounds. Gillian Fernsby (Anna Carteret), wife of the lodge's former owner, is the mother of Lorraine (Elizabeth Rider), Dr. Stoke's faithful nurse. Junior surgeon Simon Eastwood (Leo Staar) has accused Stoke of misconduct when a young patient was permanently disabled in surgery. Deciphering the relationships between characters somewhat overwhelms the murder mystery.

""The Lions of Nemea"" finds DI Lewis ensconced comfortably back in his old position and working side by side with Hathaway, while DS Maddox does a lot of the spade work. An American classics student, Rose Anderson (Alisha Bailey), is stabbed to death on her evening run after having a big argument with her roommate Chlo (Jessica Henwick) over Chlo's boyfriend Harrison (Michael Ryan). Rose had recently had an acrimonious breakup with an older married physics professor, Felix Garwood (John Light), the husband of the professor handling her thesis, Phillippa Garwood (Andrea Lowe) and uncle of young Tabitha (Kitty Rich), a seriously ill child Rose was tutoring so that she might keep up in school. Rose's research revolved around a Victorian translation of a lost Euripedes play that had been unearthed by Professor Simon Flaxmore (Clive Merrison), who claims never to have met her. Again, we have an unlikely tangle of relationships that take more effort to unravel than the murder mystery does.

Graham Lawrie (Alec Newman) was convicted of the murders of 3 police officers 13 years ago, but his conviction may be overturned on appeal in a matter of days in ""Beyond Good and Evil"". Lewis is irate, as he was the investigating detective on the Lawrie case. As the detectives brace themselves for the appeal, someone calls 999 to report a jumper on one of Oxford University's towers. PC Mark Travis (Gruffudd Glyn) responds...and is struck down with a sharp instrument resembling the roof slater's hammer that Lawrie allegedly used. Did police and prosecutors get the wrong man all those years ago? Did Lawrie have an accomplice? Or is someone trying to make it look like Lawrie is innocent in anticipation of his appeal? Lewis, Hathaway and Maddox makes the rounds of Lawrie's psychiatrist Dr. Sally Rook (Susan Wooldridge), his solicitor Katherine Warrick (Priyanga Burford), his tutor in nihilism, Oxford professor Brendon Ward (Tom Davey), and smitten supporter Pamela Carson (Robin Weaver) to find the killer.",1413849600,45,4271,5.23065693430657

I notice at the end of the program PBS is listed as a producer, you would think they would make more money off the program by showing the complete show, not edited.  Why would I buy a dvd from them when I can get the real one from BBC and when the money rate is configured I have found them to be a few pennies cheaper. I am wondering if this is what happens when you get ads involved from corporations. Have to cut to make room for other stuff. (as my college professor said "" the word is material not stuff"" but in my thought it is stuff.",1413763200,6,742,3.9798657718120807
6588291,5,B00MK1RA4G,"Although the actors in this series said they were moving on, they are back much to the delight of their fans.  This time there is a new dynamic.  Hathaway is in charge!  And he's delightful as boss.  He has grown up before our eyes!  Thankfully, Lewis can handle it and there's not much friction between the two.  Their camaraderie is appealing in this s eries.  Can't imagine Morse playing second fiddle to Lewis, but Lewis does it with grace and they actually operate as kind of equals.

Hathaway has an assistant, a beautiful young sargeant!  She is smart, and engaging.  A definite plus to the old boys club if I may express it.

These changes bring a freshness to this series, but there's enough of the usual to be comfortable.  Of course the familiarity of Oxford as the backdrop is a HUGE attraction.  There are some great shots of it this season.  Was a little peeved at Hathaway for throwing his cigarette down in its hallowed street in the last episode.

The first episode in this season was very choppy with plots and subplots which rather confused.  By the third episode, it was much more cohesive and focused.  Looking forward to more please.",1413676800,2,1155,4.610837438423645

6588298,5,B00MK1RA4G,"The boys are back!  And, more human than ever.

Lewis is softer, as he ""takes a break from retirement.""  Hathaway is complex as ever, with an obvious internal storm which we will never know.  But in this series, unlike the others, they are now personal friends above all else.  Can you imagine Hathaway saying ""Robbie?""  Well, he does.  :)

This season, there is also a great crowd of wonderful women:  Innocent is a bit softer too, and Laura is now a significant other, rather than an unspoken flirtation at work.  She is really beautiful and warm.  And, there is the new sergeant!  I forget her name, (she is such a new character,) but she is Hathaway's second in command.  Well portrayed and a pleasure to watch.

The cast of featured characters in the mysteries is stellar as always, and completely takes the audience into the rabbit hole.  That, the writing, the music, the cinematography, and the overall sense of perfection of this series which has kept this series at such a high level of excellence, continues in season 7.  This season offers, as a bonus, an air of sentimental payoff for its long-term fans.

Enjoy!",1413676800,119,1125,4.687179487179487

6588316,5,B00MK1RA4G,"This is a conditional one star review. The original UK version of the series is 360 minutes for the three two hour episodes. It will be available from Amazon. UK on Nov. 17. If this version is 360 minutes long, then the one star review will be changed to a five star review. If it is the horribly chopped up version shown on PBS with each episode cut from 120 minutes to about 80 minutes, then this review will stay a one star and I strongly advise everyone to avoid this DVD like the crap it is and instead go buy the one from the UK. Since Amazon doesn't list the time on this release, I can only assume it's going to be the cut version from PBS, and hence the one star review. If Amazon adds the time and it is 360 minutes, then I'll change the review, but till they do, or somebody buys this and reports back that it is the 360 minute version, the rating will stay at one star. And don't be thrown off by the series number. This is actually series 8 in the UK, but PBS combined two series for some reason and so calls this series 7.

UPDATE: I got a post from a UK viewer and he said they are shown in the UK as six 1 hour shows, but with ads, so the actual running time is much less than the six one hour time slots would imply. I also noticed that Amazon has added a time for the series at 270 minutes, roughly 90 minutes an episode, which also ties into the PBS broadcast of the series in three 90 minute time slots. Since PBS typically only edits out about ten minutes from the shows, that also matches up with 90 minute original episodes. Due to this new information, I'm changing my review to five stars based on the content of the show now that the time discrepancies have been resolved.",1413158400,139,1698,4.114457831325301
